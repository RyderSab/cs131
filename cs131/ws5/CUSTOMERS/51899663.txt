From the very beginning of this story, I wanted to toss the book aside.  I hated the leading female character (Mared) from the get- go.  She only got worse as the story unfolded.  At one point, she seems to finally come around.  Then, she receives a large inheritance and decides she doesn't need the leading man (Payton) any more.  She runs off and flirts with every man she meets.<br /><br />Mared is selfish, spoiled, mean- spirited, and ungrateful.  She is also lazy and spiteful.  Payton, on the other hand, is generous, romantic, thoughtful, patient, and loyal.<br /><br />By the end of the book, I was really wishing he would tell her off.  I would have loved to see him get a stronger back- bone and find a woman worthy of his devotion.<br /><br />I gave the book 2 stars, because the writting was vivid and fluid.  It was enough to keep me reading to the end.	2005-08-21
US	51899663	R39DMJQCFPGHWC	0385338252	453044037	The Immortal Highlander	Books	1	16	25	N	N	After such a long wait, I'm so disappointed	I, like all of Moning's \\"Highlander\\" fans, waited for months for her newest release to come out.  I bought the hard cover without a care for waiting for the lower priced paperback.  Her Highlander stories of the past have been so good, I couldn't wait to read a detailed story of the dark and exciting Adam Black.<br /><br />My first disappointment was the fact that she turned Adam into a wimp.  The \\"Black\\" name should have been changed to \\"Pure White.\\"  He is physically powerful, but his dark, sexy personality is totally gone.  He is now soft and concerned only with saving the world.  Blah!  This can't be Adam Black!<br /><br />Second, if I wanted to read ads, I would open a magazine rather than a book.  Every other page was filled with label dropping.  I have a serious suspicion that Moning received royalties from several clothing, shoe, and car companies, as well as restaurants.  With each new day in the story, we had to read about the brand of pants he wore, the brand of boots he wore, the high- priced restaurant he got his dinner from, and what type of car the couple road in.  It got to the point where I was skimming through pages to get past these brand plugs.  (I've never had to skim through Moning's books before...  very disappointing.)<br /><br />By the time the couple got to Scotland, I was down right bored.  I quit reading the book.  Enough is enough.	2005-05-28

This is the third &quot;Highlander&quot; book I've read.  I previously read Moning's &quot;Kiss of The Highlander&quot; and &quot;The Dark Highlander.&quot;  Both were 5- Star reads for me.  This one was also excellent, but there was one thing that annoyed me:  The leading lady's meanness at times.  She purposely calls the hero (Hawk) by another man's name whenever he kisses her.  She does this because she was hurt by another man in the past, and she has sworn- off men.  But she has no regard for how much it hurts Hawk every time she does it.  She treats him with a generally mean spirit through most of the book.<br />Other than that, the overall story is captivating.  There is plenty of mystery, romance, and action.  The love scenes are great.  The book is really hard to put down.  Moning truly knows how to write a story.  I'm anxious for the next Highlander book coming soon.	2004-02-21

A knight (Sin) in the service of the English king is ordered to marry a Scottish heiress (Callie), in order to get her clan under<br />English control.  Neither the bride nor the groom wants the marriage, but they are given no choice.  When they meet, they are attracted to one another, but both are<br />independent and don't want to lose their freedom.  Sin decides not to sleep with her, so that he can get an annulment later.<br />After the forced marriage, they return to Callie's lair in Scotland.  Her clan is angry that an Englishman is now moving into their land. Callie's younger brother<br />causes problems to try and force Sin out of their home.<br />Over time, Sin proves his bravery and selflessness by saving the lives of the Scottish people who have been shunning him.  He eventually wins their respect.<br />Callie is determined to break through Sin's hard exterior.  She plans to honor her marriage vows.  She lavishes Sin with praise and affection.  Sin begins to<br />soften and open up to Callie.  However, he worries that he is not honorable enough to deserve Callie's devotion.<br />Sin's brothers and childhood friends join the story about mid- way through.  They are a terrific source of humor.  The story as a whole can get quite dark,<br />because Sin's childhood involved a lot of rejection and severe abuse.  So the humor is a welcome break.<br /><br />Callie is likable, because she is strong and stubborn, but still soft- hearted and feminine.  She can wield a sword with great skill, unfortunately the author only<br />brings that skill into the story once.  I would have enjoyed seeing more of Callie's strength and ability.<br />Overall, the story is quite captivating.  Not very original, but definitely well written.  It kept me interested from start to finish.  The love scenes are great and<br />there is refreshing surprise involved.  I would easily be giving this book 5 stars if the basic story line was more unique.	2004-02-11

Beyond typical romances	We've all read hundreds of romances where the couples' conflict is based upon the usual insignificant ideas:  petty pride and stubbornness, differences in social class, etc...  This story breaks that mold.<br />Bently Rutledge is known for being irresponsible and for enjoying fast women.  However, he is not the typical rake.  He drowns himself in drinking and other reckless behaviors in an effort to forget.  There is a demon from his past that has left him ridden with guilt, anger, loneliness, and a deep resentment towards his older brother.  This is a demon that destroyed his innocence as a boy.  It is a demon that many readers will identify with.  Real and soul wrenching, Bently has buried it deep inside.<br />Frederica (Freddie) has been raised by her relatives, after her unwed parents died.  She believes that no honorable man will ever ask for her hand.  She decides to quit saving her virtue for a marriage she will never get to have.  Bently has been her friend for years.  She decides he is the one she will give herself to.  She coaxes Bently past his limits of restraint.  They share a night that will change their lives forever.<br />Freddie knows there is something dark that threatens her relationship with Bently.  He has nightmares that cause him to act out violently in his sleep.  Determined to save her husband from his self- destruction, she searches for answers.  She finds far more than she was expecting.  She urges Bently to talk to his brother.  However, she soon finds that there is an even darker twist that tore Bently's soul from him as a child.<br />When the truth comes out, Bently believes his family will turn him away for good.  To his surprise, he is supported and comforted.  His soul is finally free.<br />Liz Carlyle writes the significant memories from Bently's childhood in a very real and heart- churning fashion.  Bently's character is so believable, you almost feel that you are sharing his pain.  Excellent writing.<br />Aside from the dark secrets, this book boasts a terrific love story.  Romance that shows Bently's true desire to make Freddie happy, affection that tells the reader how precious his unborn child is to him, love scenes that set the reader's blood to boiling.  The story continues to slowly unfold, without side topics that pull away from the main couple.<br />The main couple is very believable.  Freddie is young and impulsive, as 18 year olds truly tend to be.  When she finds a &quot;naughty&quot; book, she decides to try some of the things she saw in the book.  Bently is in for a big surprise.<br />Bently has a reputation, but those who know him personally are aware that he has a genuinely good heart.  He has spent his life searching for unconditional love and acceptance.  By the end of the book, you will want to be the one to offer it to him.<br />My one complaint was the fact that Carlyle mentions far too many outside character's names and relations.  They are mentioned only fleetingly, but it did leave me confused.  These people never became a real part of the story, so mentioning them was unnecessary.  Still, a 5 star read because of originality, great love scenes, powerful characters, and a core story that reaches beyond the typical romance.rets, this book boasts a terrific love story.

But it definitely works in this book.  The story of the main couple is good.  However, there is a second couple in this book who are pure magic.  Put both stories together, and you have an excellent read.<br />The main couple, McKenna and Aline, are childhood friends who grow up and fall in love.  He is a servant to Aline's English family, she is a noble woman.  Her father finds out about their relationship and forces Aline to send him away, threatening to torture and kill McKenna if he ever returns.  Aline tells McKenna she doesn't want him, so that he will leave and be safe.<br />12 years later, after the father has died, McKenna returns after having made his fortune in America.  He is angry and set upon revenge for the way Aline had sent him away.  They discover that they are still in love, however Aline is vain and sends him away again because she does not want him to see her fire- scarred legs.  This annoyed me.  After he sends her 15 dozen roses, writes a poem for her, pays musicians to serenade her, etc., she is so vain that she would rather crush McKenna than allow him to see some scars.  Still, when she finally chases him and tells him the truth, the make- up scenes are terrific.  You learn to love McKenna more and more.<br />The secondary romance was actually much sweeter.  McKenna's business partner, millionaire Gideon Shaw, is out walking in the garden one evening.  He comes upon a woman dancing alone.  He wants to know her, but she is aware that he is known for drinking too much.  She leaves without giving him her name.<br />The next day, he spots her out walking.  He chases her in hopes of finding out who she is.  The two walk together and get get to know one another.  They share several kisses and she reveals that she is lady of the manor.  She is Aline's sister, Livia.<br />Gideon is besotted with her.  He uses his best charm and treats with respect.  Over the next weeks, they get to know one another better.  Livia is not a virgin, having been engaged in the past.  When Gideon is forced to go to London on business, she throws caution to the wind and follows him to London.  They spend a week of sneaking to one another's room every night.  He tells her he loves her, and asks her to marry him.  She regretfully turns him down, not wanting to spend her life watching him drink himself to death.<br />Feeling she is worth any sacrifice, Gideon tells Livia he cannot see her for 6 months.  He asks her to wait for him, while he tries to break his drinking habit.  They write romantic letters back and forth, while he challenges himself to become a better man for her.  This couple is one that you feel a personal hope for.<br />Terrific love scenes, lots of passion, an overall story that keeps you reading.

Cassie can't figure out why Angel didn't fight to stop it from happening.  Nor does she understand why he took his marriage rights with her.

Feeling he can't offer her a good life, he decides to leave and let Cassie's mom push for a divorce.  Before he goes, he wants to do something for her.

The scenes that are exciting don't last long.<br />It's a quick and easy read.  Sweet story.  Not the most exciting.  The love scenes are very mild.

But I just can't read another word of Lakota Winds.  I've managed to get to page 195, and I give up.  The characters are flat and uninteresting.  There is no excitement to the story line at all.  Whenever a scene comes up that has the potential for being exciting, the author glosses over it with an easy solution.  Everything about the story is typical.  You can guess what will happen next, and it does.  Sappy line after sappy line, you can't help but roll your eyes at the way the author writes the dialogue.<br />The one character who could have been great, the heroine Chumani, is destroyed at the very beginning of the story.  She was a warrior woman, but is quickly married to a warrior from another tribe and she spends the rest of the book gathering fire wood and sewing.  Blah!  I can't take any more.	2004-01-23

Their love life and attraction to one another sizzles, but they communicate with one another as well as toddlers would.  Mistakes and misunderstandings that would be easily solved are painfully drawn out.  Every time one is willing to talk, the other refuses to listen.  When one is willing to listen, the other refuses to talk.....<br />The story starts out humorous, when 14 year old St. John is forced to marry 7 year old Christy.  She kicks him in the shin and sticks her tongue out at him during their wedding.  Gotta love her spunk.  Then the story jumps ahead about 15 years:<br />St. John (Sinjun) likes the ladies, alcohol, and gambling.  Each time he gets mad at his wife, he runs out and finds himself a mistress.  No faithful longing for his wife here.<br />Christy has a horrible knack for telling huge lies and for making rash, terribly bad decisions.  More times than I can count, she nearly destroyed both her marriage and her people.  She is the Laird of her Scottish clan, but is far too impulsive to make good choices for the clan.  When an enemy tries to take the clan over, she proves to be a weak leader and her hubby (Sinjun) has to jump in and fix things for her.  (Which nearly gets him killed.)<br />I still give the book 4 stars, because it is entertaining enough to keep you reading.  The story line is original and the characters are realistic.  But it does start to drag when the leading lady's mistakes and impulsive actions wear on you, as well as the leading man's \\"sins.\\"	2004-01-13

Modern day smart girl, Gwen, has had a dull life.  So dull, she believes that at the age of 25, she is &quot;the oldest living virgin.&quot;  Ready to find some excitment, and hopefully some romance, she takes a tour of Scotland.  Much to her disappointment, it turns out to be a Senior tour.  Dismayed after days of riding in a bus with elderly people, Gwen takes a hike on her own.  She searches the hills above the famous Lach Ness.  Falling through a weak spot in the ground, Gwen lands inside a deep cavern...  landing squarely on top of an unconcious man.  He's handsome, powerfully built, and too her relief he is breathing.  Unknowingly, she breaks the spell that has left him sleeping for 5 centuries.<br />The last thing Drusten remembers, he was racing toward the Lach Ness, desperate to find his brother's killers.  Now, he is waking in a dark cavern with a pretty lass sitting on him.  Assuming she is a willing lass, he gladly welcomes her.  When she quickly alerts him as to where they are, and how she got there, he releases his grip on her hips.  He rises from the ground to dress himself, shocking Gwen as he arms himself with dozens of knives and an ax.  His only clothing... a plaid and some chest armer.<br />Drusten finds their way out of the cavern.  He's enchanted by Gwen, and he plans to take her back to his castle.  When they are within seeing distance of a local village, Drusten is shocked by what he sees.  &quot;What is that?&quot;  &quot;A car.&quot;  Drusten realizes he is far from his own time.  He must get to his castle grounds and make sure that his clan is safe.  In order to save his family name, and the history of the Druid blood, he must return to the 16th century.  Without her knowing, Drusten plans to bring Gwen with him.<br />Once the ritual is performed, Drusten realizes that fate will not allow him to stay with Gwen in the 16th century.

She has good reason.  He sets out to get her hand in marriage because he wants her dowry.  She doesn't want to get married, so he almost rapes her to put her in a position where she'll have no choice but to marry him.  He stops at the last minute, but they are seen by Lily's step- mother.  Lily's father insists that they marry.  Matt gets his money.<br />Over the next months, they fight non- stop.  Lily believes Matt is still seeing his mistress.  Matt believes Lily is falling for his lawyer.  Still, they have a passionate sex life.  The love scenes are great, although it gets old seeing each of them begin with Lily protesting and saying \\"Stop.  I don't want you.\\"  Matt manages to change her mind each time, followed by Lily swearing that it will never happen again.<br />The couple end up stranded alone on a desert island.  They are there for a couple of months.  They finally open up to one another and fall deeply in love.  Finally, a break in the complaining and fighting.  This part of the story is encouraging.<br />As soon as they are back in civilization, all of the old themes repeat themselves...  they are suspicious of one another, Lily \\"doesn't want\\" Matt, etc...  They have a huge fight as Matt goes off to fight in the war between American and England.<br />In the end, all is solved and love prevails.<br />I love Connie Mason, but I just didn't enjoy this story as much as others.  I believe Connie's medeival romances are her best.	2004-01-08

US	51899663	R88CX8OC6SHHP	0843929588	430305341	Tempt the Devil	Books	4	8	9	N	Y	Good, but not Connie Mason's best.	I believe I would have enjoyed this book more if there had been one less abduction of the leading lady, Devon. Three times she was taken from the hero of the story, her lover and eventual husband Kit; AKA &quot;Diablo&quot; the notorious pirate. The first time you can feel for the couple. The second time, you can still sympathize. The third time, you're just left feeling &quot;oh brother... again?&quot;  The last time was also annoying because she could have easily escaped from the &quot;deaf/ mute&quot; maid that she was left with...  but she never even tried.<br />I'm a big Connie Mason fan. I love many of her books, including &quot;The Lion's Bride&quot;, &quot;The Laird of Stonehaven&quot;, &quot;Sheik&quot;, and &quot;Lionheart.&quot; However, this one repeated it's themes and restated the history of the many characters over and over again. I believe it could have been great, if about 100 pages of it had been deleted. I was also dismayed at the way every single character found love in the end. A bit too idealistic. Even two of the worst foes of the story, who kidnapped and even tried to kill the leading lady, never got justice... instead finding true love. Only one foe of the story actually received his just punishment.<br />It was still a good read, because Mason made the leading couple so magnetic. The love scenes are good, although they also got a bit repetitive. I liked both the hero and the leading lady. All of the characters of the book very vividly written. Overall, I just wasn't as enthralled in Mason's story line as I have been with her other books.	2003-12-08

The first third of the story is about Kathy meeting the ghost of Latoka half- breed, Dalton Crowkiller.  This is easily one of the most heart- churning and innocent stories of building romance I've ever read.  They can see one another, they can talk to one another, he can even hold her and kiss her for a moment.  But his spiritual energy becomes weak, causing him to fade away if he spends the energy expressing his feelings.  They are becoming so close in heart, but are so far from the ability to show it.  Here is the story:<br />  Kathy has inherited a ranch from her late husband's family.  No one has lived on the ranch for decades, because the place has a reputation for being haunted.  Kathy moves in and begins rebuilding the more- than- century- year- old ranch house.  She has a feeling that she is not alone.  She thinks she has even seen a man outside her window.  Who is he and why is he watching her?<br />Dalton was the &quot;fastest gun in the west&quot;, back in the 1870's.  He worked as a hired gun.  When a white woman seeks to seduce him, he turns her down because she is married.  Angry, the woman accuses him of rape.  Being a half- breed, he is not given a trial.  He is whipped and hanged.  With the rope placed around his neck, he vows to haunt the home and never give his killers peace.<br />For 125 years, Dalton's spirit has hovered over the ranch where he was hanged.  Bored and lonely, he finds fun in scaring the people who occasionally rent the house for vacations.  He does so by taking people's keys, and by moving things around in the home.  He does all he can to make his presence known, because no one can see him or hear him.  This all changes when a woman moves into the home.  He is amazed to learn that she can see him.  She can even hear him and talk to him.  Even more amazing: they can actually touch one another.<br />Once her fear of this ghost fades, Kathy quickly becomes grateful for his presence.  She has been lonely and grieving for her husband for over a year.  This Lakota ghost quickly becomes her closest friend.  He helps her rebuild her home and teaches her to ride a horse.  Before long, their relationship builds just like the home they are restoring together.  They are falling in love, but can not express it completely.  Dalton pleads with God to give him another chance at life with Kathy.  Kathy makes the same plea, realizing that Dalton has given her back what she has been missing for the past year: Hope.<br />While out riding, the couple stops at &quot;the hanging tree.&quot;  This time, they make their heartfelt pleas together.  As an answer to their pleas, they are sent back in time to a few weeks before Dalton's death.  He is now whole and human again.  They are given a chance to change the past together.<br />Again, this is only the first third of the story!  There is so much more ahead:<br />  They live in the town where Dalton was killed, travel together to Dalton's Lakota village, then travel to Boston to seek out his mother and get married.  They both have a horrible feeling that their time together is limited.  Feeling that everyday might be their last together, they spend what time they have showing their love for one another.  When time runs out, will they be separated?  Will he be allowed to return with her?  He would even willingly become a ghost again if it meant being with Kathy.  What will fate hand them?<br />This couple is so beautiful together, I found myself nearly holding my breath while waiting to see if they would win their quest for a lifetime together.  I felt every one of their highs and lows throughout the book.  This is some excellent writting.<br />Nearly 400 pages long, I read this book in one day.

You'll be swept away.<br />Kristina, a young and adventurous white woman, is brought to live in an army fort.  Her father is an honest and honorable officer, whose job is to keep piece and uphold the laws between the whites and the Indians.  He has raised Kristina to be tolerant, and even provided her with an Indian nanny as she grew up.  This nanny taught her to speak the universal sign language of all Indian tribes.<br />Now a young adult, Kristina is asked to act as interpreter for a small band of 3 Indians who claim to seek trading within the fort.  But they actually have another purpose...<br />Tahiska, White Buffalo, is a young Lakota brave of 23.  At this early age, he has already earned great honors among his tribe.  His peace and happiness are destroyed when his father is murder by drunken soldiers.  He vows revenge, traveling with his 2 most devout friends to the white man's fort to seek out the murders.  When he arrives there, he meets Kristina.<br />From their first meeting, Kristina and Tahiska are fascinated by one another.  Soon, that fascination becomes attraction, then love.  Seeking to honor Kristina, Tahiska brings gifts to her father in the Lakota tradition.  Her father accepts them, not realizing that by doing so he is agreeing to allow Tahiska to marry Kristina.  Even Kristina is unaware, until after the ceremony is complete.  Worried that Tahiska will be killed by angry soldiers if their love is found out, the couple keeps their marriage a secret.  Worried that Kritina will not understand the ways of his people, Tahiska keeps his revenge plot from her.<br />Through acts of bravery, Tahiska proves his love for Kristina many times.  He slowly romances her and teaches her the ways of his people, hoping that she will one day agree to live with him in his village.  In return, Kristina proves her love by sneaking away from the fort each day to be with him.  Throughout the entire story, the couple's love radiates.

Her leading lady, Susannah, is such a real woman of the late 90's that you can almost pretend the story is about you.  She has the same habits, likes and dislikes, hobbies, and tastes as you or any of your friends.  She loves to read romance novels and dreams of meeting a &quot;Mr. Right&quot; like those in the stories. (Sound familiar?)<br />Susannah attends a powwow in Orange county, CA.  There, she meets an old indian who gives her an eagle prayer feather.  He insists that she take it without paying for it, saying that it is meant to be hers, and that if she prays with it her dreams will come true.<br />Susannah wakes up in an army camp in South Dakota, in the year 1870.  There, she sees him for the first time.  Tata Sapa (Black Wind) is a prisoner serving 3 years hard labor for stealing a cow to feed his people.  He recognizes Susannah right away as the woman he had seen in a vision 6 years earlier.  Susannah recognizes him as the indian who was in an old photograph she had purchased back in her own time period.  Each night she sneaks to his cell, where they gaze at one another in amazement.  Sparks fly and she helps him escape.  This is only the beginning of the story.  Now, the real adventure begins.<br />Susannah and Black Wind travel around South Dakota.  They make friends with an elderly white couple, rejoin Black Wind's Lakota tribe for a short time (Susannah isn't welcomed with open arms), marry in their own private ceremony, live privately near a waterfall, attempt to make peace between the Lakota and the &quot;blue coats&quot;, and face imprisonment by the army together.<br />Will they escape prison and hanging?  You'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />These are just a few highlights of this amazing story.  There is so much more.  The book is 395 pages, and never once gets boring.<br />The love scenes are very tame, but so romantic.  Susannah, being a woman of the 90's, is not a doe- eyed virgin.  She teaches Black Wind how to kiss like white people do.  Black Wind is an eager student.<br />The book involves many likable characters who make you smile, and plenty of &quot;bad guys&quot; to keep the story exciting.<br />Great read.

She is an excellent story teller.  This one was not quite as exciting as some of the others, but it was still terrific.<br />Lyon of Normandy is a bastard knight, who has no land or title.  Still, he is a fierce warrior, loyal to the death to King William of Normandy.  Because of Lyon's loyalty, William gifts the conquered land of Cragmere to him.  The King also gives him the last living heir to the land: 14 year old Lady Ariana.  The king insists that they marry, in order to make Lyon a titled Lord.<br />Lord Lyon is not about to bed a child, so he sends her to a convent to be raised into adulthood by nuns.  He leaves her there, forgotten, for 5 years.  At the insistence of the king, Lyon finally goes to reclaim his bride.  Instead of receiving a docile young woman, he finds his bride to be as angry and resentful as he left her.<br />Over the next weeks, they struggle through jealousy over one another's past relationships, as well as Ariana's hatred towards her husband's people who killed her family and stole her land.<br />Lots of ups and downs, exciting battles, terrific love scenes (Mason never disappoints with her love scenes!), and mystical twists.<br /><br />I believe I would have enjoyed the story more, if Ariana had been a bit more proactive.  She was brave, surviving through canings at the convent, and keeping her chin up during confrontations with enemies.  However I would have liked to see her at least try to do something to save herself from dire situations...  perhaps attempting to escape the convent, or attempting to escape a later  marriage that she is forced into by King Malcolm of Scotland.  Instead, she just accepts these things and waits for someone else to get her out of bad situations.  Do something, woman!<br />Other than that, it was a great read.  It never got boring.	2003-11-15

It is a refreshing change from the typical romance stories that take place in either early America, or Europe.  This story takes place in exotic Morocco, where Connie Mason entreats you to a rich culture that includes Arabian clothing, castles, foods, etc...<br />Ms. Mason also stays true to her way of creating a heroine that is brave, strong, smart, and yet still feminine.  Zara is a Berber warrior princess, who fights boldly against those who oppress her people.  She has a smart wit, and a sharp tongue that almost cause her to be beheaded by the Arabian sultan.<br />Sheik Jamal is intrigued by her daring.  He is used to the submissive women of his own culture.  He persuades the sultan to give Zara to him as a slave.  Expecting to easily tame the woman he comes to call &quot;Vixen&quot;, Jamal is in for a much greater challenge than he bargained for.  Zara is headstrong and willful.  She takes on Jamal's male slaves and female concubines in both verbal and physical battles.  Meanwhile, her father plans a raid to free her.<br />This is only the beginning of the story!  The rest follows through with exciting sword battles, humorous battles of will, exotic love scenes (really good ones!!!), and romantic encounters.<br />My only disappointment came with the last few chapters.  Jamal and Zara are forced to flee Morocco and settle in England.  They leave behind their warm exotic world, and move into one of his many English estates.  It turns out he holds an English title and vast wealth (surprise, surprise). For me, it didn't come close to comparing to the beauty of the Moroccan castle and culture.<br />A final conflict arises when Jamal's mother disapproves of his choice of wife.  This conflict is too suddenly solved.  Also, a very typical twist is thrown in for Jamal's mother.  I wish Ms. Mason would have left the couple in Morocco, ending the book with them living in the same unique  surroundings they had through the rest of the story.<br />All told: Some of the best love scenes I've read to date. Interesting and exciting characters.  Fast passed and never boring.  This book is a great read.st of the story.<BR>All told: Some of the best love scenes I've read to date.

Romance, passion, suspense, excitement, humor, and great love scenes.<br />Gunnar and Raina are a very believable couple.  Gunnar is a powerful knight, but not inhumanly untouchable.  Raina is innocent, but she has courage and strength.  They don't fall in love too fast, nor are you made to wait until the last pages for their relationship to blossom.  When they do come together, they are magic.  You can't help but feel joy for them.<br />Gunnar is a proud knight, and the Lord of his castle.  He is brave and strong, but his soul is lost in a quest for vengeance against the man who slew his parents.  His heart and his life are changed forever when innocent Raina gives him her favor at a tournament of local knights.  To his dismay, he finds out that she is the daughter of the very man he seeks to kill.  As a man of honor, Gunnar refuses to take the man's life in any way other than a man to man battle.

What will become of them all?  You'll have to read the book to find out!<br />At 325 pages, I still read this book in one day...  because I simply could not put it down.

It's hard to like a heroine who is mentally unstable.  Betsy Tyler, A.K.A. &quot;Crazy Bets&quot;, had a bad experience in her past, which now causes her to freak out and go to &quot;that place she goes sometimes,&quot;  which leads to her locking herself in her room and sitting on her floor loading a pistol, and believing that the hero of the story is actually Satan.....  This girl is not all there.  What bugs me the most about it is the fact that she is given a child to raise about half way through the book.  (No child needs to be in that kind of situation.)<br />The hero of the story is unique.  He is a preacher, but has a bit of a dark shadow in his soul.  That shadow is caused by a desire for revenge against the men who killed his family.  He is good to the people in the towns he preaches in, and makes it a goal to save Betsy from her demons and bring her back into society.<br />I had to skim through a lot of pages, because it did get quite boring and redundant.  However, to core story is good, because it is unique.  No &quot;love&quot; scenes, but a few sweet kissing scenes. (He is a preacher, after all.)  Interesting span of characters throughout the book.<br />All told:  If you can find a cheap used copy, give it a swing.  But there are much better reads out there.	2003-11-08

I've read a lot of duds lately, so I was thrilled while reading &quot;Gentle Rogue.&quot;  It never got boring.  I read the entire 426 page book in a day, because I could not put it down.<br />James Malory is a terrific hero.  His wit keeps you grinning through out the story.  He's also big, strong, brave, and all man.  Although he has a dark past, he has a soft heart for the women in his family.<br />Georgina Anderson makes a great heroine, too.  She is strong- willed, but not nasty like some heroines turn out.  She has guts and is willing to work to make her way home, to America, from England.  She's intelligent and witty, as well.<br />The families of both James &amp; Georgina are also a good source of humor.  James has 3 brothers, Georgina has 5.  All enjoy ribbing one another in a way that makes the whole story fun.<br />Great love scenes, that are steamy without going over the edge.<br />This is my first book by Lindsey.  I'm definitely going to look for more of her work.	2003-11-08

It has been 100 pages of the heroine, White Dove, berating the leading man, Jeremy.  100 pages of her going over how inferior he is and why he will never be good enough for her.  100 pages of him trying everything to receive the slightest kind word from her, but she continues insisting on pointing out all of his short comings.<br />The characters are typical and flat.  The only one I could find any emotion for was Jeremy, and that emotion was sorrow.<br />I'm very disappointed.  I usually prefer books where the female lead character is a strong warrior woman.  But this woman was too hard to like.<br />The story is very slow.  After 100 pages, there is no progression towards a future at all.  It just stands still.<br />Generally, I can get through a good book in a day or two.  It has taken 3 days to get this far, and I'm not willing to spend another day hoping it will get better.<br />Having trouble falling asleep at night?  Read this book.	2003-11-03

You never get bored, and the author never takes you off track from the main couple for too long.  I did start<br />to worry that this was going to be one of those stories where the woman keeps the hero hanging until the very last pages, but she comes<br />around and vows herself to him a little more than half way through.<br />They meat in England, in a dark forest.  He saves her from a pack of wild hungry dogs, by using his unique power to communicate with<br />animals.  He is &quot;The Chosen One&quot; of his Cherokee tribe, imprisoned and forced to flee to England.

Fire Hawk secretly waits, watches, and provides food for Kate's household during a devastating winter.<br />When they finally make their escape together, they live and get to know each other better on a private island.  Fire Hawk teaches her to<br />swim, makes friends with a dolphin, rescues a hawk, and shows Kate how to live in the wild.  During this time, Hawk makes vows to<br />Kate... but she refuses to commit.  All the while a nemesis, Gar - jealous cousin of Fire Hawk - hunts them down. He takes them captive<br />and brings them to his village.  Both are condemned to be sacrificed.  It is at this point, that Kate vows herself to Fire Hawk.  She proves<br />herself by setting Frie Hawk free, and by killing a man who threatens to shoot him.<br />After a triumphant escape/ war scene, the two are on a trek towards Fire Hawk's people, with Gar in close pursuit.  Will they make it?<br />You'll have to read the book to find out!<br />Exciting story overall.  Great battle scenes, great historical background, excellent love scenes.  The hero, Fire Hawk, is brave, courageous,<br />honorable, mysterious, and also quite funny. He adds a lot of humor to the story with his whit. Kate is a refreshingly brave and strong, while<br />still fitting the role of an English woman who is out of her element.<br />Great read!of humor to the story with his whit.

It doesn't take long to solve the mystery of the story for yourself.  It is not an uncommon theme.  However, I still found myself glued to the book.<br />The writing is excellent.  The characters are vivid and realistic, not the perfect bodies and flawless faces that we so often read about.<br />The story moves and keeps you interested.  It is exciting enough to have you on the edge of your seat at times.  Then at other times it becomes endearing enough to make you mushy inside.  At still at other times, it is fun enough to make you smile.  (&quot;Chopper&quot;, the moody cat, is one good source of humor.)<br />Terrific love scenes.  Daring and steamy.<br />This was my first Lisa Kleypas novel as well.  I will look for more of her work in the future.	2003-10-29
US	51899663	R1LKVETFARUBS5	0843944145	803019392	Savage Wonder (Leisure Historical Romance)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Good read.  Whimpy leading lady was a bit annoying.	The story overall was entertaining.  Personally, I like leading ladies who have some guts.  This one was just too soft for me to believe that she would willingly run off with an indian chief.  She couldn't bere to have dirty foot prints on her cabin floor.  She couldn't even stand to go fishing because she didn't want to kill a fish.<br />I actually preferred the character of her younger sister, who participated in hunting and warrior challenges.  I would have been glued to the book if more time had been spent upon developing her character.<br />Usual Cassie Edwards timeline has the leading couple falling in love within 24 hours of first meeting one another.  This is hard to believe, but expected from her stories.<br />Again, it was entertaining and worth the read.  I'd like to see a sequel that tells the story of the younger sister.  I believe it would be far more exciting.	2003-10-27
US	51899663	R5I77J19MP93D	0821745204	424390890	Time's Angel	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Another Excellent Story from The Queen of Love Scenes!	I don't usually go for time travel novels, but this one was so terrific!<br />You will laugh when Angela, a gypsy woman, holds the duke's entire staff at knife-point because they want her to take a bath!  This book is full of humorous points such as that.  I loved Angela's character.  She is not a spoiled rich girl, but is a very down- to- earth street gypsy of the mid- 1990's, who is transported back in time to the year 1745.  A duke takes a bet with a friend that he can turn her into a lady within 1 year.  The duke gets more than he bargained for as Angela turns his home, his staff, and later his heart up- side- down.  Once she becomes a lady, the duke is hopelessly lost to her.  He pulls out all of the stops to win her heart:  steamy bathes, romantic dinners, gifts, picnics, you name it.  Romance galore!<br />Adding some excitement to the story: Angela discovers a band of gypsies in the 1745 time period.  Finding that they are much the same as her gypsy people from 1994, she joins them in dancing  and jaunting around their camp fire.<br />Angela later discovers that she must save the duke from  a wrongful execution, with knowledge that she has from the future.  Along with her new gypsy friends, she sets out to produce the evidence of the duke's innocence.<br />As always, Kathleen Drymon sets the pages on fire with her love scenes.  Never a single disappointment there!  Very steamy and detailed, but never distasteful.  Also, never rushed... they go on for pages at times!  Yummy!<br />Another thing that I love about Drymon's books is the fact that I never once catch myself skimming through paragraphs and pages to get back to the main plot.  She sticks with the main characters and keeps the story moving.  Excitement, adventure, romance (tons of romance!), and plenty of good- natured laughs.	2003-10-24

You can get through this book in a day or two.  The plot is smooth and entertaining.  You won't get bored, but it never gets extremely intense.  Conflicts are present, but are soon resolved in ways that are believable.<br />It was nice to read about a tribe that you don't hear about very often.  This is the first book I've read that was based on the  Seneca tribe.  It was interesting to learn about their dwellings, etc..<br />The characters are unique, as well.  Shawndee, the leading woman of the story, has been raised to dress and act like a boy.  Her mom is a tough talking, rough- around- the- edges tavern owner.  The leading man, Shadow Hawk, takes Shanwdee away from it all.  He gives her her first dress and treats her like a lady.  I liked him alot.<br />True to Cassie Edwards' writing style, the couple falls instantly in love.  No &quot;beating around the bush.&quot;  But the romance is sweet and heartening.  The love scenes are good.<br />Overall, nice story.  Not enthralling, but nice.	2003-10-21

Cholla decides he would rather die trying to return home on foot than to live on a reservation in Florida.  He escapes the train and sets out on a 1500 mile trek to his home land.  Desperate for food and a horse, he comes upon the ranch of young widow, Sierra.  And so the adventure begins....<br />True to her style, Georgina Gentry has packed this book with historical fact and real people.  The earth comes alive, traveling from Missouri all the way to Arizona.  Although the trek is tough, romance blossoms.<br />There were some parts of the story that lagged.  I found my self skimming pages here and there, where the story veered away from the main couple.  But these slow parts didn't last long.<br />There were also a couple of coincidences in people who met that made it seem like the world must consist of very few people for their paths to have crossed.  However the storyline itself was very believable.  The characters very alive.  The struggles realistic.<br />Gentry fires the book up with sensual and romantic love scenes. Bold, but not disturbing.<br />It did get a bit annoying that it took until the last pages of the book for the couple to admit they loved one another.  I spent several chapters wishing they would get over it and be happy together, even as there continued to run from the army.<br />Overall, worth while read.  Great story and high adventure.  Terrific ending!	2003-10-20

Cassie Edwards has written books that I have enjoyed.  (Savage Embers is one of my all- time favorite romance novels.)  But this one was awful.<br />This book was a disappointment on so many levels. The portrayal of the characters was totally off. (A real Blackfoot Chief would never have been this mushy in front of his whole tribe.) No true history was shown in storyline at all. There was no excitement... I found myself skimming through pages just to get it over with. The ending was a total bore. Every time it seemed like an exciting plot may finally be coming, it was ended before it began. Every conflict was sewn up neatly by solutions that were not at all believable. Far too many circumstances throughout the story were way too convenient to seem possible. (Family members showing up to save the day from out of no where. A deserted cabin in the woods that was full of food and clothing that happened to be the perfect size for the woman, and for her little brother as well????)<br />Cassie Edwards is famous for having her characters fall madly in love within 24 hours after first meeting one another. That has always been hard for me to take. This storyline was just not good enough to make me overlook that this time.<br />BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!	2003-10-14

This book was another example of why.  Rather than another helpless little waif, Blair is written as a strong and powerful woman.  She is a faery woman, with the powers of healing and foresight.  A nice mystical twist that makes the story unique.  Blair must fight against people who try to take her life, claiming her to be a witch.<br />The hero is so hot!  Brave, honorable, strong, everything you want in a man.  You'll get good laughs out his imagined idea of what Blair must look like, before he met her face to face.  Having heard the rumors that Blair is a witch, Graeme's mind brings up images that will crack you up.<br />Terrific love scenes!

I'm always drawn to stories where the leading lady isn't a dainty little thing, but is instead a strong and fearless warrior.  Connie Mason made this heroine tall, muscular and brave, yet still feminine enough to fall into the romantic role.  You enjoy reading as &quot;Venora&quot; engages in exciting sword battles, as well as reading her take on femnine tasks such as midwifery.<br />Classic &quot;love ya&quot;, &quot;hate ya&quot;, &quot;love ya&quot; storyline, but it never gets boring.  These two main characters are electric together.  I got several laughs out of their stubborn tongue battles.  I got a lot of enjoyment out of the firey love scenes as well.<br />My only complaint... Connie, can't you find a better word for the male anatomy?	2003-10-14

Very well written and triumphant.  Also, Baker makes good use of the Lakota language and stays true to many of their traditions.  As a historical story, this book is very enthralling.<br />The romance is good, because of Blue Hawk's devotion to Kaylee.  However, Kaylee gets annoying because she pushes Blue Hawk into dangerous situations, with only her own comfort in mind.<br />The end is very depressing.  It is true to history, but I like leaving a book with a happy glow.  This one ends with Blue Hawk in despair over the loss of his friend and leader, Crazy Horse.  Also, Blue Hawk's people are all dead or scattered, and Blue Hawk is forced to give in to living in the white world.  No happy ending here.	2003-10-11

It makes the romance between Night Thunder and Rebecca unique and deep- rooted.  The story as a whole, captivating.<br />Night Tunder is a hero in every sence of the word.  Honorable, brave, and powerful.  He is also a Medicine Man, who is able to communicate with spirits from the past.  Rebecca and Night Thunder are both shocked to discover that she also has &quot;great medicine.&quot;  The two finding that they can communicate even when separated.  Romantic!<br />Rebecca is a bit annoying at first, because she actually considers giving up Night Thunder for the sake of wanting to attend a ball.  (Is she nutty?!)  But thankfully she comes around.  And as dedicated as he is, Night Thunder finds a way to give her everything she ever wanted.  Very Romantic!<br />This book was great from start to finish.

Good giggles when Gen-ee has a few problems learning the Indian way of life.<br />I did find the beginning of this book to be a bit slow to get moving.  But once Gen-ee manages to take Gray Hawk captive, the story takes off and never slows down.  So keep reading!<br />Adorable ending had me closing the book with a smile on my face.<br />I've read all 3 of Kay's \\"Blackfoot Series\\" books.  I recommend them all.

This girl has known hardship in her life.  She accepts her indian friend from the first time they meet.  They do fall in love much more quickly than it seems two people really would, but aside from that their characters are very realistic.<br />I also love that this hunky indian chief fell for the her when he thought that she was a chubby girl. (He didn't know she was actually pregnant.)  I adore a hero who can love a girl that doesn't have the perfect body.  I also adore the fact that he takes pride in claiming her new daughter as his own. Also, the fact that he proudly takes his new wife with him everywhere he goes, claiming that &quot;This woman is not only my wife, but my best friend and companion.&quot;  Talk about romantic!<br />This book is long (442 pages), but I still read it in 2 days.  I never wanted to put it down.  Even with all of those pages, the story never once got slow or boring.  There are exciting expeditions and excellent love scenes.<br />Finally, another thing that was different about this book was the fact that it didn't end too abruptly.  Generally, when the villain is beat, the story is over.  This story continued for several more chapters.  For once, you get to see how the couple moves on into their future together.  That is something that I wish more authors would pick up on.<br />Highly, highly recommended!	2003-10-07

This story was no different.  Very exciting, heart- gripping, and triumphant story for anyone who enjoys real Indian history.<br />I was disappointed in the romance part of the book.  The leading woman does not even come around and show a bit of true affection towards the leading man (Cougar, Apache army scout) until the very last couple pages of the book.  By then, I found myself wishing that Cougar would just dump her in the desert and move on with a better life.  I personally enjoy reading about some happy times between a couple.  There were none present in this story.<br />I still recommend the book.  The story of the hero character, &quot;Cougar&quot;, makes the whole thing worth while.	2003-10-02

You will understand the characters better, but you will also have a renewed attachment to all of the couples that makes this book so much more heart- churning.<br />&quot;Gentle Savage&quot; greatly reconnects you to Sacred Eagle &amp; Kalina, and Star Hawk &amp; Silver Star.<br />Still wish the ending had been better!	2003-09-19

This was a nice switch.  I enjoyed following her writing style through a whole different atmosphere.<br />The story is exciting.  The heroin is brave and smart, which I enjoy a lot.  All too often, the woman in a romance book is written to be helpless.  Not so in this story!<br />The leading man is a classic Drymon hero.  You'll wish you had a man just like him!<br />The story centers around a lot of exciting American history.  This was a fun read!	2003-09-16
US	51899663	R1T734ZOSX9DIH	0821759248	983780111	Legend of Desire	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	This is a sequal to &quot;Precious Amber!&quot;	The main couple in &quot;Legend of Desire&quot; is not directly related to the couple in &quot;Precious Amber&quot;, however, it involves the same tribe.  The &quot;Precious&quot; couple do play a significant role in the second half of the &quot;Legend&quot; story, so reading &quot;Precious&quot; first will help you make connections when you read &quot;Legend.&quot;  Plus it is nice to see how the &quot;Precious&quot; couple got on in life.<br />I enjoyed &quot;Legend of Desire.&quot; The storyline is unique and very romantic.  You get to enjoy classic Kathleen Drymon love scenes and exciting battle scenes.  This story was also fun because not only is the hero everything you ever wanted, but the woman is a heroin as well.  She has her own important place amoung the tribes.	2003-09-16

It is accurate to history, and so exciting you can not put it down!<br />This author does an excellent job making you feel like part of the scene.  She takes you on the 1500 mile trek that the Northern Cheyenne made in their fight for freedom.  The characters are vivid, their struggle is heart- breaking and yet heroic.  Many of &quot;The People&quot; in this story will become special to you. Each battle will have you glued to the pages.  I found myself actually holding my breathe as I read at times!<br />The romance is moving and totally consuming.  The love between the characters is radiant.  Also, you will enjoy some very steamy and daring love scenes.<br />I hated to see this book end!  I'll definitely be checking out more of this author's novels.	2003-09-14

And now that I have read &quot;Destiny's Splendor&quot;, I wish I had known before that the two are relative.  Both are EXCELLENT!  I would have loved to follow the story of the first couple and then go on to the story of their children.  I met them in reverse, but I still loved both stories.<br />In &quot;Destiny's Slendor&quot;, you get to follow a true Kathleen Drymon classic love story across the Blackfoot valley, all the way to London.  The hero is brave, strong, and spiritual.  The story is exciting and very romantic.  You'll feel attached to the couple by the end of the story.  You'll love to move on and see what happens in their future when you read &quot;Velvet Savage.&quot;<br />Now Drymon, we want a third!  What happens next????	2003-08-29
US	51899663	R16LNMIXK8E890	0821748300	812603588	Savage Heaven	Books	5	13	14	N	Y	EXCELLENT!  Must read!	There are several parts of this story that remind me of the 1972 Indian Romance classic \\"The Second Kiss\\", A.K.A. \\"Nakoa's Woman.\\"  But this book is also true to Drymon's style of deep- hearted romance and very steamy love scenes.  It also follows Drymon's way of making you fall in love with the hero of the story, by writing him as powerful and spiritual, yet gentle at the same time.<br />The hero of \\"Savage Heaven\\" is a powerful cheif of an Oglala tribe.  The leading lady is a girl who was raised by her aunt and uncle on a traditional ranch.  There are many unique twists to this story, including how she came into the hero's hands.  The story is very endearing, but never boring.  You will be taken on hunts and into battles, and also swept into a pure and beautiful romance.  Evil lurks and threatens, but Cheif Wind Dancer proves to be a true hero.<br />The ending is exciting and original.  Throughout the book, you'll find yourself totally involved with the characters.  I read this one in two days.  I could not put it down.<br />I would LOVE to see a sequel to this one!	2003-08-29

The characters are vivid and the story exciting.  You'll laugh, cry and sit on the edge of your seat.  My only complaint is that the ending was too hasty.  I had to read the last page several times to try and figure out if it was a happy ending or not.  After 350 pages of being involved with the characters, I wish there could have been a more fullfilling ending.	2003-08-29

Kathleen Drymon is my favorite, now more than ever.<br />What I love most about this book is that for once the leading lady isn't a fainting delicate flower, powerless to defend herself.  She is a warrior as tough as any man.  Drymon makes the heroin come to life in exciting hunting scenes and vivid battles with enemies.<br />The man who steals her heart is a fearless warrior as well.  Brave and powerful, but all heart.<br />The two of them take turns protecting one another's lives, and the lives of their friends/family.<br />Excellent love scenes that are refreshingly different from Drymon's usual text.<br />I'm keeping this one to read it again!	2003-08-14
US	51899663	R2AM5MUBTHYUOL	0505524015	902978014	Chase the Wind	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Entertaining, but predictable	I didn't even know that this book was a sequel until I finished it and read the author's letter at the end.  But now I understand why the parents of the main characters in this book where given so much time.  Apperently, they were the main characters in the original book, &quot;Apache Runaway.&quot;<br />Truely, &quot;Chase the Wind&quot; isn't so much an Indian Romance.  There are a few chapters in the beginning where the main couple are living outdoors, but after that it becomes very domestic.  It actually gets a bit depressing at times because it so emphasizes how much the Apaches had lost and how they would never live freely again.<br />There were some boring parts where you wish that some excitement would start up finally.<br />On the good side, the scenes are well- written so you are able to picture them in your mind.  The characters are likable. (Although the leading lady is a bit too dainty at times.)  There are some exciting scenes to keep you reading.<br />The ending was a bit too much.  Predictable and quite corny.  Everyone in the story ends up finding love and getting married...  and I do literally mean EVERYONE!  But overall, the book was entertaining.	2003-08-12
US	51899663	R1PI9QXZE7FW7Z	0821753282	265027162	Precious Amber	Books	5	7	7	N	Y	Oh- so- good!	Although this book is slow to start, the rest of the story makes up for it.  Lots of true Sioux heritage is mixed with a wonderful romance. For any woman who tends to be shy, the woman in the story will be very easy to relate to.  The hero is a patient and spiritual warrior who brings her out of her shell.  Very endearing story, but also exciting and full of action.  Also, one of the best endings I've ever read!  I will read this one again.<br />Drymon outdid herself.  To date, I would have to say this story is a close second place to being my favorite.  My favorite being Drymon's &quot;Blaze of Desire.&quot;	2003-08-10
US	51899663	R3M3ODEIEF8KFS	0821762117	453706257	Comanche Cowboy	Books	3	8	10	N	N	VERY DARK STORY!	There are several brutal rape scenes in this story, so if you are sensitive to that you will want to pass on this book.  A lot of anger and hatred, but several romance scenes as well.  Personally, I like a story where I can really like the \\"hero.\\"  But you can't really enjoy this guy.  He's angry and vengeful from start to nearly finish.<br />Also, there are several pages in the book that you can totally skip without losing the story at all... because the author goes into way too much of the life memories of characters who are not important to the story at all.<br />If you can find a cheap used copy, give it a swing.  But don't hope for too many happy feelings while reading it.	2003-08-10
US	51899663	R3550EAXGC4B7K	0821739247	969773545	Warrior of the Sun	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Classic Kathleen Drymon	The book was excellent.  K.D. knows how to draw you into a story.  Vivid pictures are playing through your mind, as once again Drymon has you falling in love with the hero.  Lots of excitement in hand- to- hand battles as he fights to save the love of his life.  If this guy exists, someone give him my phone number!<br />You are swept right into the excitment from the very beginning.  No waiting around for the story to get moving.  Surprise ending has you on the edge of your seat.<br />Terrific from start to finish.	2003-08-08
US	51899663	RA6BFTQJYINO7	0821738887	7160529	GENTLE SAVAGE	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	What the heck happened????	Kathleen Drymon is easily my favorite romance novelist. This book was as terrific as her others, until the very last chapter left me wondering just that...  &quot;What on earth happened to the story?&quot;  <BR>For the first 300 pages or so, K.D. takes you on another of her exquisite adventures into Indian territory.  The story is fun, playful, exciting, adventurous, and oh- so- romantic.  In her usual style, K.D. makes you fall in love with the hero of the story, and identify with the young woman. She writes so vividly that you are actually seeing the story in your mind like a terrific classic western/ romance movie.<BR>Then you get to the last chapter.  All of a sudden, she introduces a whole slew of new characters and takes off into a whole different plot.  Everything is thrown together and you long to get back to the original story.  I waited through the first half of the last chapter for the hero to come and rescue his wife from her captors, in a bold and exciting battle with the villain who had stolen her.  That didn't happen.  What did happen was a very disappointing scene that seemed straight out of a bad soap opera.  Finally, even faster than all of this was introduced, the story is sewn back up in the blink of one page.  HUH?  What happened to the  beautiful story that I read for over 300 pages?  What a disappointing end.<BR>I still recommend the book.  I would easily be here giving this book a raving 5 stars, except for the late disappoinment.  K.D. makes it worth your while through the rest of the story.  You will get to enjoy a great adventure and a magical romance.  I just wish she would have continued that to the end.	2003-08-04

Great mix of western/ indian history and romance.  I started reading it Sunday morning, and finished it Monday morning (around 4:30 am!)  I had to know what was next!<br />The hero character of the story is everything you ever wanted in a man.  This author can write!	2003-07-30
