His recollection of the first years at Amazon is quite interesting. What makes it less interesting to me is that he was an editor and he believes that this function was a critical piece of Amazon. He gripes with the idea - and complains a lot - that Amazon became more automated (more technical) and he (and his colleagues) weren't needed anymore. I actually think that the editorial stuff wasn't really the most important so I cannot accept his complaints. I would love to read a similar account written on behalf of the Amazon' technical stuff. Still, the account of 'irrational exuberance' of the start-up (somewhat familiar to me) and how it is becoming more an more something like typical corporate stiff culture is entertaining. I found annoying that the author is trying to show how educated he is. The chapter devouted to Raplh Emerson seems totally out of place here. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book.	2005-05-14
US	37368248	R1BRCC2GITKNH9	0156849054	710522506	The Star Diaries	Books	5	18	19	N	N	The best!	The best book from Ijon Tichy series. The set of stories is the best I read from this series. The stories, written in various years, show how diverse Lem is. Some of the themes he touches here are very serious, e.g.planet with the 'water cult', planet with 'no identity' people, religious monk/robots, etc. Some are masterpieces of sci-fi humor (multiplication of Tichy on the ship is just the best), some are just a simple fun (twentieth voyage with the attempt to fix the past from the future with the outcome that anything significant that happened to the human race is because of mistakes in trying to fix the history). Highly recommended to anyone (not only sci-fi fans). And by the way - it is totally different from 'Solaris'.	2005-05-14

I got this book after reading a previous book by Lincoln Child, \\"Utopia\\", which I liked very much. I wasn't disappointed although I have to say that \\"Utopia\\" was better. This book makes for a very easy, fast paced, page turning, read. One could argue that characters are not very developed but this somehow doesn't spoil the fun. I don't agree with some of the reviewers that reffered to this novel as sci-fiction - just having non-existing company and non-existing computer with unusual powers dowsn't qualify for sci-fiction. So you shouldn't expect here all the other qualities that come with sic-fi territory. The novel is not without shortcomings. I pretty much knew the gist of the ending long before the end. Some of the points that are related to the artificial  intelligence and the computer that is part of this story are argumentative (but not utter ridiculous, as in some other works of similar genre). Still, I would recommend the book as a very good entertainment.	2005-04-16

I found this book to be an exhaustive study of the history of the orgasm and of various factors that shaped the orgasm perception throughout the history in various parts of the world - I found this fascinating. It is not an academic work despite many references that exist in this book (I totally agree with another reviewer here that index would be very helpful).  At the same time the work is serious enough not to take it lightly. It is based on a lot of research. The author is a good writer, which is very important and makes the difference, and the book makes for an easy read even when complicated matters are approached. The only slight negative I felt (and this doesn't affect five stars I gave to the book) is that I had a feeling - based on some remote knowledge I have on a couple of points not directly related to the main theme of the book - that the author sometimes was trying to impress us by exaggerating some events that possibly took place. It is something that would be unexusable in the academic work but doesn't spoil the impression here.	2005-04-10

Still, the story left me a little confused. I didn't really understand what it was supposed to be about. There are two layers there. It seems to be a serious work that involves such themes as destiny and true calling, talent and meaning of life. But then there is this mistery angle, something like Don Brown, just more intelligent. It has a very interesting premise but the book doesn't really cover this subject, leaving a lot of holes and dedicating the space in the novel to this just between other things. At the same time, this mistery storyline dillutes the more serious layer of the book. The end result is that both layers are left me with the feeling of being not complete. Still, the book is interesting - just be prepared for the slow immersion into the atmosphere the authors created in this novel.	2005-03-30

Ijon Tichy' stories are always fun to read, no exception here - some kind of combination of absurd and  science fiction genres (of course, Stanislaw Lem has so much more than this). This is the later work by this master and I do believe it's not his strongest - but even so it is very good. At the same time, for somebody new to Stanislaw Lem I wouldn't recommend to start his journey here - there are better starting points. This book will be better appreciated by somebody already familiar with Lem books in general and with Ijon Tichy stories, in particular.	2005-03-13

As probably many other readers I was reading Dan Brown books backwards - starting from 'Da Vinci Code' to 'Angels and Demons' and now to this one. And every book amplifies more and more the characteristics of Dan Brown' writing, which is interesting subject, interesting plot, lack of any characters development and wooden writing. I would say that this book has all this with the two latter qualities taken to the extreme. It's so badly written that I fought very hard with myself not to drop it in the middle. In the end it got a little bit more interesting (if you will succeed in not paying attention to all kinds of gaps in the plot). The subject of the novel is computer security and the book has quite a few wrong statements and descriptions, which is disappointing. I would say that the author is far from the expert on this subject. Overall it is by far the weakest book by this writer.	2005-03-06

The book gives a very good overview of commodities trading and mostly intended for somebody, who is totally new to this field but has at least some background in stock trading (like myself). It doesn't provide a complete coverage of the matter. In other words, you will not be able to start trading futures (at least with some probability of success) after reading this book. Nonetheless, the book is a first step towards understanding of this very complicated subject and does it very well. I found a second half of the book, where the author shares his personal (very extensive) experience, especially useful. A lot of this insight could apply to stock trading but there are also a lot of nuances, specific to commodities. Overall, highly recommended!	2005-02-27

If only I could give two different ratings to this book I would first give it five stars for bringing up a very interesting point of view on the subject that affects everybody. Enviroment problems in general, and global warming, in particular, is something we take (I definitely am) as totally established fact. Michael Crichton expresses an opinion that goes completely against mainstream thinking and I have to say that his arguments look quite convincing. Some of the reviewers here provided a link to the site with the rebuttal to the Crichton theses. I went there and this web site actually could not eliminate many doubts that were seeded in my mind while reading this novel. Five stars for courageous effort of bringing a very controversial subject. <br />On the other hand, in terms of thriller/action novel this is probably the weakest one by this very tallented writer. The plot sometimes looks ridiculous, the characters sometimes not believable, etc. From this perspective, I would give it two stars.	2005-02-17

The pace of this thriller is very fast, the characters are mostly very developed, the plot is if not competely original, definitely has a quite a few unusual turns. On the negative side, as it was mentioned in some other reviews, the novel has a few cliches. Some of the plot lines are not always believable. But, overal, it's a very good entertainment. I will definitely read the next book by Jack Kerley.	2005-02-02

The way he recreates with painstaking details both physical surroundings and state of mind of main characters leaves you feeling like you experienced it yourself. At the same time the main focus of this novel is religion, particularly christianity. The other stuff, such as description of travel by japanese envoys to Europe that took place in seventeenth century, although extremelly vivid and interesting, serves mostly as a background to more deeply embedded line of deliberation on the meaning of christianity. The book also helps to better understand the modern Japanese society through the prysm of the first experience between japanese and european societies. I gave it only four stars because I found the novel to be sometimes too slow, even repetitive, But it could me just my perception.	2005-01-30

If you are looking into some advice on 'practical speculation' then, contrary to what this book title suggests, you will not find it here. After finishing this book I cannot think of anything useful I read there. The book mostly is a tribute to Victor Niederhoffer' various skills (mathematics, squash, etc.), which quite frankly I do not care about. The criticism (or bashing, should I say) of various famous investors or prominent figures of the investment world borders on ridiculous. I am not saying that these investors are right in their approaches and Niederhoffer is wrong - honestly, I don't know. But the way Niederhoffer deals with it is very condescending and lacks of any real proof. In very few cases when the author tries to support his words with some statistical calculations I found such calculations to be totally unconvincing and taking completely out of context. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one (that this book definitely deserves as a financial education tool) is some amusing stories and facts I found there. Overal it is still a waste of time.	2005-01-19

I've read this book after reading \\"Madman's Tale\\" by this writer that I thought was brilliant. I guess I set too high expectations because 'Analyst' was quite disappointment. It's not that this is a bad book. It's a well done thriller and the author is just a very good writer. You still want to get to the end to resolve the mystery. At the same time, the book is sometimes slow and in some parts is quite predictable (maybe I am so brilliant but I figured out much of the plot by the middle of the book). Still, it is much better that majority of thrillers out there.  <br />	2005-01-14

As with some other reviewers here this is my first experience with John Katzenbach books. I found, first of all, that he is a very good writer. The way he tells the story and develops characters makes it already a very good read. Add to this a suspense and mystery (there is a plenty of it in the book) and you get a novel that you cannot put down. I was surprised with the thorough and knowledgable way (at least that's how it seems to me) the author describes the life in psychiatric hospital, where the action in the book takes place, and the state of mental illness. You can really feel the atmosphere and this brings this novel to another level. <br />This is not a book, where a lot of action happens on every page. In other words, it's not an action thriller but rather psychological drama	2005-01-02

First, the author definitely tries to give an objective account, giving the positions of both Falun Gong and Chinesse government, at the same time providing her own commentary. Second, the book is very concise. Every page contains information that is neccessary for understanding of various aspects of this religion and all this is delivered in very clear fashion. I found the chapter that analyses the roots of Falun Gong, its relation to other, older religions and various events in Chinesse history to be very informative. I definitely cannot say that I am anything like an expert in this matter (this is my first reading about Falun Gong) but it seems to me that I got an understanding of this movement.  <br />Highly recommended to anybody wishing to  understand main ideas of Falun Gong and the place of this movement in Chinesse history.	2004-11-16

For the simple reason that there are just too many trials the author tries to cover. The value of this book  for me that it shows the dynamic of development of the legal system in the US.

It provides an interesting portraits of people involved in making these decisions. It is not an academic book and intended for mass audience since it's quite easy to read. The only issue I have with this book is that it seems that sometimes the author wanders away from the main subject of the book and although it is usually still interesting observations it doesn't always serve the purpose of this book.

Unfortunately, there is no logic whatsoever in how everything is explained in the end.

I found this book to be pretty much complete history of the relationship between hockey players, team managers, agents and team owners and the NHL. It shows how players salary got from being unadequate to what some people can say ridiculously high.  The author definitely knows the subject and knows many people that took part in making NHL history. Although I knew most of the facts, the author puts a human face to it, narrating this through the eyes of people that played a central part in making it all happen, which makes this book a great read. I especially liked the fact that author tries to give an objective account. What's more he gives in the end of the book a few possible resolutions for upcoming lockout, one of which I found very convincing.

Many reviews here stated that this novel by Jonathan Kellerman not as good as his other novels with Alex Delaware as a main character. I disagree. It's just different. Despite similar medical background, which could be expected, a lot in this novel, including a pace, is different. Maybe many readers started this novel having certain expectations based on previous Alex Delaware works and got disappointed but this difference doesn't make it worse. Granted, there are a few weaknesses (for example, antics of members of 'conspiracy club' sometimes seems silly or the ending may feel not very convincing) but I totally disagree with reviews that say that this book doesn't have a suspense.  Although maybe the book has less action we used to find in the author' other books this one kept me very intrigued. Overall, recommended to all Jonathan Kellerman' fans.	2004-06-10

First of all, the name of the book is misleading. Although many chapters are devoted to 401k it's really just a background for authors musings about capitalism, free market and the government. The main theme of the book is that government has to be in charge of workers pension since nobody else will guard their interests. The problem though that in giving us the reasons why it has too be so the authors sometimes not very convincing and often contradict themself. For example, they totally reject the notion of partially privatizing social security (where employee will be in charge of part of their money) but at the same time advocate employees total control over their 401k (I am not trying to argue for one soluton or another - just state the fact). The book tries to give an answer how to invest during stagnating market but doesn't give any insight and simply rehearsing whatever was said many times and what more or less educated investor already knows. Yes, the authors are right to be concerned about the state of financial affairs of current and future retirees but I found their notion of 'evil Wall Street' not very serious. There are so many factors at play and relegating it all to 'bad' corporate world would oversimplify very serious problem. Three stars for bringing the subject up but not dealing adequately with the issue.	2004-05-31

This book is full of very interesting mostly phylosophical (especially interesting on role of religion) and metaphysical discussions. The drawback is that it's much more difficult to read. It takes some effort (at least this was the case for me) to get to the end. Although the series started as quite typical sci-fi I can't consider it to be this genre anymore (the presense of another planet and alien cultures notwithstanding). I am not saying that it's a shortcoming but it's something that future readers need to keep in mind not to be disappointed. I believe Orson Scott Card is a very smart person but not a great writer (if you judge his novels by such criterias as plot and character development). Still, it's a very interesting book assuming you know what to expect.	2004-05-27

It's almost funny but reading this book and trying to follow the logic of the author, her many quotes from various sources, creates a totally opposite effect from the one the author desires. Just in this particular sense the book is a failure - it failes to convey the message. Besides, it's full of hatred and very obnoxious. Al Franken called this book a political pornography and I totally agree. The book contains a few interesting points and arguments but the way Ann Coulter writes about it kills any potential interest in these points and arguments (in the end people don't watch pornography to find some interesting ideas).	2004-05-17

It has the atmosphere so familiar from Harry Bosch series (a little dark, a little lonely) - although I think nothing can beat Harry Bosch. Anyway, the story was great (if maybe a little slower then usual although it doesn't mean this is a shortcoming), the characters are very well developed, the suspense is present and it was scary... until the ending, which I found very disappointing. Without revealing the plot I would just say that I found the ending totally unwarranted. It just wasn't logical and seemed made up just to finish the story in some unexpected way. I still give the book four stars since even with this ending it's a good book and I can recommend it to all Michael Conelly fans.	2004-05-12

I understand that things changed since but I didn't know that originally yakuza was all about gambling.

Somehow I missed Ender series and when I started to read it now, the first book, 'Ender's Game', didn't impress me so much (I am not saying it was a bad novel, it just wasn't up to the hype surrounding it).  But 'Speaker for the Dead' was totally different. It's more a phylosophical book then just sci-fi (many present sci-fi attributes notwithstanding). It covers many interesting aspects of religion, ethics, etc. The planet and aliens living there are just a background for this book. The only shortcoming for me originate in its advantage - I didn't feel good coonnection with the first book, both in the plot and novel structure and in character development. I would think that Ender in the second book is a totally different person, even taking into the account the age difference. Some plot developments looks unsubstantiated (such as travel to different planets that allowed Ender to stay young), but since that is not a main point in this book (at least for me) it didn't bother me. <BR>I am moving to the next Ender' book.	2004-04-23

The main purpose of this book is to show that mutual funds industry overall does not provide a good choices for regular individual investors and the book covers this topics exceptionally. It really reveals the real intentions of the industry and shows that this is the only way this indstry can work. The book advocates passive investment and especially index funds and exchange traded funds (ETF). While there were already quite a few good, if controversial, books about efficient market theory ('You can't beat the market'), such as famous 'Random walk On Wall Street', this book brings more details about today market environment and explains what choices passive investor has.  My only complain is that sometimes I feel some kind of zealotry in authors considerations. Even for somebody that believes in efficient market theory some of the statements in this books could seem very questionable. Stock mutual funds takes majority of books space but the moment authors venture to the other territory (and they do try to cover practically all kinds of investments) their arguments often seem too absolute. Still, this is the book every investor in mutual funds must read (and it will probably convince you to make some changes in your investment strategy - it did this for me)	2004-04-12

I enjoyed other, more recent, books by William Poundstone and I decided to try this. I was very disappointed. I am sure the fact that the book was written twenty years ago contributes to my disappointment: many subjects present only nostalgic value for some people and mostly outdated. Don't look for revelations - the author is mostly speculating on the subject (secrets mostly will stay secrets). In our time much more and better information could be found on the Internet. I gave it two stars just for some historical data that I found sometimes interesting.	2004-04-03

I was interested in the history of codebreaking in World War II but my very incomplete knowledge about the subject stemmed from fiction work, both movies (such as \\"Enigma') and books (such as Neal Stephenson' 'Cryptonomicon'). After reading this book I have now a very clear picture of what really happened. The author does a great of explaining in great details the history and background of this cryptograhical war. The emphasize of this book is really on efforts by both British and Americans to break German codes although activities to break codes of other Nazi allies also described. The author does a very good job of explaining how various algorithms worked in a language that should be understandabe to anybody (for somebody who is interested in more technical details there are a number of appendixes). It provides a very good and 'live' portraits of people that were involved in these activities. It made me realize how much bureaucracy and stupidity these people had to overcome. Highly recommended for anybody who is interested in the subject but feels he still didn't get a complete picture.	2004-03-21
US	37368248	R340KBDVLFVTDS	0345458915	730478278	The Sinner	Books	3	1	2	N	N	ok thriller and bad melodrama	I can't call this novel a thriller for the simple reason that most of it is about feelings and love affairs of two main female characters (police officer and medical examiner. These characters are also in other books by this writer.) I didn't find it very exciting (on the other hand, I am not a big fun of this genre). The rest (whatever is left) of the book is good enough thriller. The author is definitely knows the subject (I understand she is a doctor of internal medicine) and the novel effectively conveys the grisly details of the murders. I found the ending to be a little bit stretched though. Recommended only if your love of medical thrillers can overcome the presense of many pages of nonsignificant melodrama.	2004-03-12
US	37368248	R38KEKBCG1J0QM	0060512806	555229230	Cryptonomicon	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Unusual and engrossing	This book differs from other works of Neal Stephenson (at least, that I've read, such as 'Snow Crash' and 'Diamond Age') since it's not about the future but more about the past. There were quite a lot of books written about code breaking wars during World War II but this one is definitely unique (well, no less would be expected from the writer). The book has very interesting characters, very good story with all kinds of technical observations and considerations embedded in it. Having said this I must say that the book is not an easy read. I cannot take on myself to say that it is bloated. Yes, it is big (in volume) and there are many times when I thought that particular description or explanation has nothing to do with the theme of the book. But in the end, who knows, maybe it all serves the purpose. I wouldn't agree with some reviewers who criticized the ending of the novel. I believe the reason it's happening (and the same could be said about other Neal Stephenson books) that we expect his novel to end on some extraordinary note, matching the spirit of whole book. I guess it's very difficult thing to do. At the same time, I find the ending to be quite adequate. Highly recommended to all Neal Stephenson fans (who, I am sure, don't need my recommendations) and computer geeks. For others it will probably better to start from some other works of this author, such as famous 'Snow Crash'.	2004-02-15

It has good characters development, funny dialogs, mistery, etc. Still I wouldn't put the author next to John Grisham as many reviewers suggest. The plot doesn't always seem totally plausible. As some reviewers mentioned I couldn't figure out why the main hero needed to pursue the bad guy even after the bad guy left him alone (I hope I didn't spoil anything here). Also, I cannot say that this action and adventure packed novel (I am not saying that this is necessarily bad). But if you put such such considerations aside the book has very likable characters and easy to follow.	2004-01-28

It is my first book of Harry Bosh' series (but I've read other books by Michael Conelly that I liked) and I was impressed. There are many novels with the motif of 'lone wolf' but it is difficult to make the reader really like the main hero. This book is the one. The plot seems totally logical and realistic, and at the ame time intriguing until the end. Mexican background, including Harry' adventures there, seems real and interesting. The police work in LA is described with such details that you definetely get the atmosphere the writer tried to convey. Definitely recommended to all fans of mistery novels and police thrillers.	2004-01-26

It is mostly interesting to read whether you agree with the author or not (I don't in many cases). At the same time, the book is written for really beginners so probably many people will want to skip some chapters as too simple and obvious. The only thing that a little annoyed me is that when author talks about technical analysis and how wrong it is he reffers to various academical studies without really giving any details about these studies. I would like, at the very least, to have a bibliographical list in the end to be able to verify author' assertions. Also, you can see that this book undergone many editions. Some points and ideas are repeated in different chapters. But in the end, this book makes an interesting read, especially for beginners.	2004-01-16

The book definitely represents a very interesting approach towards 'historical Jesus', which was very unexpected for me. The author supports his reasoning with convincing research that takes a very different, from established, look on Jesus crime, arrest, trial, abuse, execution, burial and and resurrection. The epilogue, where the author talks about himself and how his personal history could have affected his view, very well worth mentioning. Although I would highly recommend this book I have two reasons for caution. First, although the author intends this book for wide audience, it pretty much reads as scholarly work, meaning it is not an easy read. This point is also confirmed by many references to the other book on this subject that the author is constantly argues with. Second, although the subtitle of this book is 'roots of anti semitism', this book is not really about it. Yes, relationship between Jews and Jesus plays very important role in this book. Bot not the main role as somebody could expect from the cover.	2004-01-09

Maybe I didn't pick the best one by this author but I found this book without much suspense, without well developed and believable characters (as much as author tries very hard to create ones), with weak plot that is not always very well logically connected. I don't say that it's a bad book, it's just not very good. Also, the fact that the main character is a lawyer doesn't make it a courtroom thriller (as it is advertised).	2004-01-05

I don't know how much of what was told in this book resembles any degree of truth. But it makes you wanting to read more on this subject. That's what I first started to do upon completion of this novel. And it's great achievment of the author. At the same time, I found it to be quite lame thriller, contrary to many reviews. The plot lines are predictable in many cases. In addition, Dan Brown is not a very good writer. His style is somewaht 'wooden' (as was mentioned in one of the reviews of this book). And what about all this itallics - I found such widespread use of itallics very annoying. That's why I gave it four stars. This book has a very interesting content, which is delivered in imperfect way.	2003-12-27

The author tries to explain experiences related to death both from medical and phylosophical perspective. He explains the major deseases (main causes of death), such as Alzheimer' desease, stroke, aatherosclerosis, cancer and just aging, in very clear and understandable language. But he doesn't stop at explaining what is happening technically with the body, he also proceeds with the desease progress as seen by the patient and other people around him. The author draws not only from his vast experience as a doctor, but also from his personal experience, which makes this book even more powerful. The main point of the book is that author belives we need to know about death to be better prepared to the end. I don't know about this but I just can say that the book left me quite depressed. It's not neccessarily a bad thing but the book is definitely not for everybody. Besides knowing the subject, Sherwin Nuland is a very good writer and this results in very convincing and powerful book. The only point that the author makes that I cannot agree with is that there is no reason to try to change the order of things in the world in regards to aging. The author believes that all attempts to prolong life are meaningless since there is an order in the world where young species replace old and that's how it supposed to be. I find such approach too 'weak' and passive, degrading in a way the purpose of humanity on Earth. Having said this, it does not affect my opinion that this is extraodinary book.	2003-12-22

First of all, it gives some psychological tips to investing, which is not a surprise, given that the author is psychiatrist. I bought this book expecting  psychological theory of investing but it turned out to be rather a minor topic. The book is concentrated much more on technycal analysis. I probably haven't read many books on investing but from everything I read this one provides the most complete picture of different methods of technical analysis (not forgetting to describe mass psychology related to every method). Yes, in some cases the book is outdated but the fact that after all the changes related to Internet, introduction of discount brokers, etc the book is still has a great value, speaks for itself. This book can serve as a very good step toward understanding technical analysis assuming you will get up to speed of today's world leveraging more recent publications	2003-12-15

This one is maybe not the best but far from the worst. The pace is sometimes slow comparing to other Davenport novels. What makes John Sandford books so special is not the plot, which by itself is not the most groundbreaking. The reason his books are succesful is that he is a very good writer, the characters are very well developed. The decription of the small town on the north of Minnesota in is very striking, the characters are very believable. You get an impression you visited the place. You can add to that mix murders and get the book you cannot put away.	2003-11-28

At the same time, it seems the the author is ardent believer in Bible code theory. I am also not a scientist. Some points look fascinating, some very questionable (but what do I know). In any case, to form any real opinion about the subject we have to look in many mathematical aspects of those findings. Maybe some people will want to look closer into scientific foundation of the author' claims and this by itself will make this book worth a few stars. For me the book provides a very interesting glimpse into Middle Eastern politics, reveals interesting touches about the characters of some of people that have been play playing important part in this development.	2003-11-24

Although we knew many modern sci-fi writers we never heard of Orson Card. I am not surprised though having finally read this book. It's actually more about the phylosophical issues related to the function of our society then just some sci-fi work. I will definitely read the next book in this series. At the same time I felt that somethig was missing, something that makes the difference between very good book and great book. The author is sometimes just too serious.

It is done from the Intel tools perspective, which is not surprising given writers affiliation. But, all in all, they try to give an objective picture.<BR>I would like to see more concrete comparisons with Jini though. None of the other, non-UPnP compatible, service discovery methods explicitly mentioned in the book but advantages and shortcomings of UPnP (and there are quite a few) could be understood only in conjunction with other developments. There are currently some domains, for example, where UPnP will simply not work. For somebody, that is interested what other similar technologies are available I can recommend the book &quot;Jini technology: An Overview&quot; by S.

Both are exceptionally well written and have everything: great plot that keeps you guessing till the end, good characters development, etc. The only thing that prevented me from giving this book five stars is that somehow it reminds me the first his book I read (I am not sure which one was printed first).
