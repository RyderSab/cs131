It was also one of the most disturbing books I've read in a long time. Lolita Files has gone into a different direction here with \\"Child of God\\" and I liked where she took me. The writing was exquisite, the characters were incredible, and the story was gut wrenching. With each page, I was more horrified than the last it seemed. The motifs and symbolism woven into the book were perfect. I read this book voraciously and still wanted more when I finished. Forget the comparisons to Shakespeare. Ladies and Gentlemen, Ms. Lolita Files; DAMN GOOD WRITER!	2004-09-20

This time he doesn't do it quite as well.  <br /> <br />The story is lengthy, in addition to slow moving and a combination of this does not a good novel make. The characters were shallow, but did pique my interest enough to try and get through it. There was a bit of intrigue, but not enough to make it an absolute page turner. There seemed to be so much background information that never made it to the foreground and the end of the book never really offered any resolution. The language was oversimplified and the metaphors were too contrived and Mr. Dickey's descriptive powers are much better than this. It seemed as if the author was trying too hard to sound like one of those black and white movies with the main character's voice overdubbed and narrating us through it. The main character, while interesting, had a past that the reader was never fully allowed to see and we never really knew the particulars of what seemed to be the catalyst for his emotional distance, especially concerning his ex-wife. Ordinarily that wouldn't be such a big deal, but it was mentioned, seemingly, every other page.  <br /> <br />Altogether, not a bad book, but certainly not this author's best.	2004-09-20

It is more than ten years old and I feel as if I just missed a friend who had waited for me as long as they could, but had to leave. I've always been curious about the surviving tribes of Afrika (I chose to spell it that way)that live off the coast of South Carolina. I've often wondered what sets them apart from the rest of us. What made them so different? Now, I know. The book was fascinating. The story was beautifully written and I was entertained as well as educated. I loved the \\"old\\" ceremonies and the \\"lies\\" (which I believe)that actually gives Afrikan people living in this country a look into their history. Our people have always had strong belief systems and these have survived. They are alive and well today. I would encourage anyone that has read this book to follow up with other books that will let us see the history of our people without judgement and the ability to live and survive independently of outside factions. A triumphant and informative work of literature.  <br /> <br />Wow...the \\"Geechees\\". I'll be seeing you soon.	2004-09-20

Ms. Whetstone has a gift for letting her characters make the story rather than just her putting pen to paper. Her books seem to write themselves. Her characters are just that; characters. The story of Herbie and Noon is a touching one, but devoid of all romance. And although that was hardly the focus of the novel, it lingers. There are many tragic heroes and sheroes in this novel and the author's ability to tie them all together with one thread to one woman who can help them all is fantastic. Excellent story. Excellent writing.	2004-09-20

Sequels are stories that are somewhat new or new to the reader because it is the telling of events unknown heretofore. Considering all that, this book still didn't work. <br />The story was painfully formulaic, predictable, and lacked realism. The characters had no depth, and the dialogue was torturous. One star is too much to give this book.	2004-05-13

I was prepared for that, but then I remembered that Bernice McFadden was writing this and it was nothing like what I expected. <br />With child molestation being what it is (in the media) the author truly personalized it and made it absolutely horrifying. I was disgusted and afraid myself, just reading it. The story telling was wonderful. That's something a lot of authors lack; the ability to tell a story. The book wasn't romantic per se,  but contemplative, hurtful, and GOOD. Excellent novel.	2004-01-25

Not everything can be as good as the original. That's for sure. <br />As good as the first novel was and all her subsequent novels were, something tells me that the fault does not lie in Mary Monroe for this sequel falling so flatly. I could be wrong (I usually am), but something tells me a hatchet job was done on this book. The characters were not nearly as strong or well written as the first book, and the story itself just meandered about until it came to a much needed rest. <br />Very disappointing and definitely not up to Ms. Monroe's usual caliber.	2004-01-24

Love will be the one in her repertoire that most of the pop influenced culture will turn to in effort to say that they have read one of her novels. They will even laud it as one of the best because this will be the only one they have read or mostly comprehended. <br />Love is an easy read, but Ms. Morrison's use of language and her power of description will still make any reader reflect on the profoundness of the story. Her characters are so captivating and so strong they almost scar you with their complexities. Yes, they do live. That is Ms. Morrison's strength; making her characters live. The story was simple, but told with a grandeur that only this author can tell it with. The scenes were full, the plot was complex, and the story well put together. <br />Ms. Morrison has done it again.	2004-01-24

I was going to write it off as melodramatic; a writer writing about what she wishes were true rather than what is. Then it occurred to me that I was railing against this story because Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings won't let me believe that Black Men like the character Blue really do exist. I am still fighting the conditioning and the subliminal messages of the dominant culture that tell me, &quot;Brothers ain't no good.&quot; <br />We don't see them, and maybe that is the intent (to not be seen), but there are Black Men who believe in taking care of  and taking charge of their communities. Ms. Cleage presents this story easily and mystically with a backdrop of reincarnation thrown in. It works. It works beautifully. My spirit and belief in Black Men has been ignited even further. The only criticism I have is that we didn't see more of the main character's struggle with sobriety. <br />Wonderful, magical and empowering novel.	2003-11-20

I try very hard not to use the word &quot;genius&quot; when describing or reviewing books and stories that I read because I think it takes genius to recognize genius. I am, by no stretch of the imagination, a genius. <br />Words almost fail me when trying to think of something to write that will make others understand what I mean and what I FEEL about this book, this story. <br />I read it slowly because that is the way the story unfolded to me. It couldn't be rushed. It refused to be rushed because there was so much it had to tell. The simplicity of it is what makes it so ethereal and larger than life. Gloria Naylor has a grip and taskmaster like command of language and can bend and shape it to her will. This book has left an indelible mark on my psyche, my soul. The love story was just one component of the book and not even the best part, but the story as a whole wraps itself around you tightly. It rocks you gently and leaves you reeling. Just like finding a lover such as that, I know it will be a long time before I find another story that touches me so deeply.	2003-09-09

I think I overdosed on Nancy Drew when I was growing up and seeing as how I am not now nor ever was a blue-eyed titian haired rich girl, I wish Blanche had been around even then. I adore the respect of The Ancestors the author injects into each of the Blanche tales and the ease that she allows the story to unfold. It's as if the story writes itself. This was anything but predictable and formulaic. What held me is that throughout the book I often forgot there was  something sinister going on. The author used the south as a backdrop and the attitudes and notions that are still very much alive today served as a captivating and thoughtful undercurrent. I think Blanche is here to stay.	2003-08-14

Since then, I avoided the hype that was heaped upon her and in doing so avoided her books. Well, I'm over that. Way over that. I'd heard someone mention Bailey's Cafe in passing and said, &quot;It's good.&quot; I don't know what book they were reading, but this was nothing short of spectacular. It's been a long time since I've read a book with so many layers and complexities, to say nothing of the angst and tension that lived within each character. I find myself reflecting on it often. There is something so fantastic about each character and yet I feel as if I could pass someone like them on the street at anytime. Gloria Naylor is an excellent storyteller and I regret that I robbed myself of such an enriching experience. I have seldom been so moved by literature and I was sad when I finished it.	2003-08-14

I can usually figure it out by the 30th page if not sooner. Secondly, this book had me in a grip mystery books seldom put on me. The story was incredibly complex. If you're in the middle of reading it, don't put it aside for too long. You'll never be able to remember or figure out what's going on. What I did like about the book was that everything and everyone involved in the tale was right in front of you at all times. The author was thorough, detailed, descriptive, and intelligent. Mr. Carter didn't make the mistakes a lot of mystery writers make by introducing characters at the middle of the story and then expect the reader to form some kind of attachment or opinion and follow them to the build-up. You never see it coming. Everyone pertinent to this thriller was seen from start to finish which is what makes the guessing and speculating so much fun. In a word, that's what this book is; a lot of fun. To say that it was lengthy is an understatement, but give it a whirl. You'll never forget it. Good story. Absolutely enjoyable.	2003-08-05

Mr. Tyree, much like another favorite writer of mine has a wonderful gift for writing from the female point of view and here again did it well. I guess it would have helped if there had been some story to go along with it,though. I appreciated the sensitivity the author tried to inject into his main character, Tabitha, but it didn't work. The other characters were never involved in the story enough to get to know them. There was a lot going on, but the reader was never let in on it. The plot \\"attempted\\" to be suspenseful, but whimpered out at just plain confusing. There were other characters who were only brought into the story at the very end of the book, which made it seem like a rush job. There was also a sad attempt at a bit of profoundness, but that failed as well because we didn't know anything or enough about the characters to know the degrees of good or evil within them. The book tried to come off as some kind of chiller-thriller, but it didn't. I think supermarket checkout trash is the best that this can be dubbed. It fell so short of what I'm used to having come from this author. I think Mr. Tyree's forte is his ability to write about Black culture, love, and spirit. This book had nothing whatsoever to do with any of that.	2003-07-25

Mr. Dickey has come through with a novel that makes the last two even three novels of his pale in comparison. I've always enjoyed the ease of his style and the sensitivity with which he writes from a female point of view. Here again, he does not disappoint. The characters were incredibly well written, memorable, and quite vivid. The sex was good, the dialogue was good, and the plot twists were fantastic. I appreciate the way his main character (who remained nameless throughout the novel, another fine touch)was hurt beyond belief, but never weakened in the sense that she became a cliche or lived up to old-fashioned, worn out expectations. I loved this book. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of five is because I thought toward the end, it went a little Hollywood and fell off a bit. Not by much, though. This novel was a wake up call in some respects. And I can't help but wonder what would have happened in Fatal Attraction if the Internet had been then what it is today? Word to the wise and food for thought for all the playas out there. Male AND female. Better be careful. :) Is it really worth it?	2003-06-19

This book was probably some of the most unimaginative, trite, amateurish, drivel I've ever seen between two covers. The characters were shallow, unrealistic and written inconsistently. They seemed to have nothing going for them except being victims. <BR>The author apparently thinks her readers are stupid and/or out of touch because with even the most mundane and simplest references, she felt a need to explain each one; explicitly. This made the book slow and lumbering and several times I just had to put it down. The metaphors were silly and brought nothing to the telling of the story. Some scenes were so convoluted with detail (not description mind you) that following what went on proved to be a chore. Basically, that sums up the whole of the book; A CHORE. I couldn't wait to finish it so that I'd never have to read it again. Absolutely horrible. And while I am not a Catholic, I'm sure those who are, might stumble upon this book and find it a little more than offensive to have their denomination insulted and reduced to &quot;a religion that dictated her life in a Latin language she could not understand&quot; (page 279 Paragraph 1). If you're going to have a character turn away from something, anything, there a lot better ways to write it, than that.	2003-06-14

This book was shared with me without my ever having heard of the author and it was a pleasant surprise. The subject of growing up bi-racial is one that is often met with a lot of contrariness, stubborness, ignorance, and anger. This book covered all of that, but still managed to tell a wonderful story about a woman who just basically wanted to live a &quot;normal&quot; life. <BR>She wrestled with betrayal, family problems, infidelity, and divorce. Despite the mundaneness of all that, the writer approached it in a way that either made you laugh or recall your own battles similar to Mingus'. This is a well written look into the life of a young woman who is stronger than she appears to be. And writing a character that way is no easy feat, especially when the reader is with her every step of the way. If anything, we should know how strong she is throughout the story, but we really don't until the last paragraph of the book. That's just good writing. The dialogue was easy and no matter how simple the plot was, it flowed and ebbed beautifully. I'm looking forward to watching this author grow.	2003-06-05

I remeber when I first read Good Hair. I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to tell friends about this wonderful new author. <br />And now two books later, I still feel the same way. Ms. Little is truly gifted. She has departed a bit from her original formula, but manages to deliver an engrossing story. At times, the story ambled and stumbled a bit, but it was very well crafted. The plot was an old one, but she went into a new direction and let us look at things at a different angle. The characters had depth, and made it easy for me to get to know them. Moreover, I wanted to know them. I'm looking forward to Ms. Little becoming quite a bright star in the literary world. If nothing else, this story drives home what all Sisters should know by now: You cannot lose yourself IN someone without losing yourself TO them.

I've read all of Sister Roby's books and I would be remiss to say this one was comparable to any of her previous work. This was utter trash. Apart from my personal opinions on interracial relationships, the book didn't flow well and I've read creative writing stories by sixth graders that were better than this. <br />The characters were weak, soap opera-ish and one-dimensional. I realize that sometimes fact is stranger than fiction, but come on...Who in their right mind (some of you know what I mean when I say \\"right mind\\") would run into the arms of a white man when their spouse has left them for a white person, goes to work everyday to be betrayed by white folks and then in the end is still pushed aside by said white man? <br />Every page seemed to be a PSA for the Rainbow Coalition as well as justification and rationalization.

With &quot;Red Dress&quot; she has crafted a love story that speaks not only of love between a man and a woman, but a woman's love for her fellow sisters. Black women have seemingly been thrust into a place that until recently we didn't want to be and that's at odds with each other. Ms. Cleage's character Joyce wants to be a healer of this rift, but knows that it begins within. Loving ourselves is the only key to loving each other. The story is a bit slow moving and the climax is predictable, but the sub-plot of women taking control of their lives with self-love is wonderful. The scenery descriptions are nearly poetic. Good book.	2003-02-02

I adore Ms. Ansa's fascination with the spirit world and I love reading her stories about it. This one for some reason put me off in the beginning. The idea was wonderful. With more and more grandparents raising grandchildren these days the generation gap storyline was one I could appreciate. Parents unable to relate to their children was nothing new, but was well done. The book, however, was too wordy. It took forever for anything of substance to be accomplished, although the car, driving, and ghost motif were more powerful than even the author probably realized. For some reason unknown to me (or hidden in my sub-conscious) this book was a bit frustrating. It didn't always hold my attention and again I think that was due largely to the wordiness and sometimes interminable dialogue. All in all, a good book from a fantastic writer.	2003-02-02

It took me two weeks to read it and the only reason it didn't take me longer was because I refused to let the sluggishness and the cliche of the plot slow me down any further. The story never seemed to have any pace to it, and it just meandered around and around until it finally ended.

This particular book has a theme that I'm finding in all of my favorite books; stories I know I'll never forget. How far do the ripples go with the throwing of even the tiniest stone?

I have to say that this is Brother Tyree's best work since Flyy Girl and I still say he can do even better. Leslie as a character and as a book was absolutely captivating. I think the author integrated the components of entertainment and education quite seamlessly. Through this work he shattered myths, piqued curiosity and gave us some much needed black history notes. I found all the characters to be well-defined and interesting. In certain parts realism takes a backseat, but with New Orleans and Vaudou as a backdrop and running theme,that was more than excusable. I thought this novel was fantastic in more ways than one and will speak for itself.	2002-11-01

While some may have laughed from beginning to end, I failed to see the humor. I was disturbed from beginning to end. I guess personally I'm in a different place and the book spoke to a part of me that didn't think anything about it was funny. Let me rescind that. A woman marrying a man for albums and then running off with said albums only to be hunted down solely for those same albums is pretty funny. :) <BR>Ms. Monroe is very gifted and I wait for each of her books with baited breath. I'd also like to say that any publishing company who didn't pick this story up and market it like the art it is, should simply close up shop forever. She has a knack for taking the grotesque and making a character that in some of our lives, occupies a place in all of us. Whether it's an aunt, grandmother, neighbor or the lady that runs a candy store out of her house, we know a woman you just don't play with like that. This is an exceptional story with wonderful and vivid characters.	2002-10-09

I've been disappointed with Mr. Dickey's last two works, but this one may right the ship or help right itself. No pun intended. :) <br />The characters were very well developed. They will be as memorable for me as Red, Brown, and Black in Sister, Sister. A refreshingly complex storyline, but falls off a bit in the attempt to make the character Scamz seem larger than life. Mr. Dickey has written from a woman's point of view before and did it incredibly well. I think this time it suffers because the main character was so colorful, and alive everyone else sort of paled next to him. <br />Nonetheless, a good read, but I know better can come from this author. I'll be waiting.	2002-10-09

And that is rich and powerful enough to be as respected as the white counterparts they are so sadly imitating. I saw the book as a bit of an indictment. The crime of self-hatred has gone unpunished for decades and decades. <br />I found Ms. Jones' story filled with character and delightful complexities woven together quite seamlessly. It was a take on an old, old story; trying to outrun the you that knows you best. Black folks seem to want to do this more than anybody. Color and status simply provided a back drop.	2002-06-28

I don't know if I'm saying this because I just came off so many literary disappointments or not, but this is literature at its finest. Ms. Jackson-Opoku is a literary seamstress as well as genuis. She has created vivid, well-defined characters. Her descriptive powers are incredible to say the least. She manages to enlighten and endear simultaneously. Wonderful writing as well as writer.	2002-05-20

I've read all her books in the hope that each one would improve as she grew as a writer. They haven't yet. <br />This book was incredibly convoluted. The characters weren't developed enough that I could remember who they were from the first time they were mentioned to the next. I often found myself, stopping in the middle of reading and trying to remember who they were. Even Miracall, who later emerged as a major character, was somewhat a mystery. I just couldn't figure everyone out. <br />As an AME, I was also a bit offended at her lackadaisical take on the democratic and spiritual structure of the church. If she thinks even two or more deacons in one AME church is a common thing, she has been grossly misled or just didn't bother to do any research. Which is to say, she thinks her readers are all Baptist, or just stupid. Few people know much about the history and operation of the oldest black denomination in the country. This would have been a nice vehicle to educate them.	2002-04-01

She is fast becoming to me a writer of TRUE literature. <br />Ms. Campbell uses What You Owe Me to take us on a journey. What a ride! This is nothing but a rich, developed and useful story with characters alongside a storyline that overlaps seamlessly into another. This seems to be a gift of her's. She does this with all her books. Her style is easy, yet thought-provoking. The only other author I know who can take the tiniest most mundane instance or action and turn it into an unforgettable story is Toni Morrison. I think Ms. Campbell is the future of good, black literature. What You Owe Me has solidified that position for her.	2002-04-01

I think we have a winner!\\" I was wrong. It took getting to the middle of the book to figure that out, but nonetheless, I was wrong. <br />The main character Zoe recounts what she says is her sexual addiction to her therapist from the time she meets her husband to the climax of the story (no pun intended). Zoe is anything but a sexual addict according to my research. Speaking of research, that's about the only good thing that came out of my reading this book. It made me research sexual addiction; something I think the author could have benefitted from. Having three lovers you come to see on a regular basis could be the preamble to a sexual addiction, but in the way the book chronicles it, Zoe just wasn't satisfied at home. No big phenomenon there. There's more TV watching going on in half the married bedrooms than anything else in the world. If her behavior could be classified as sexual addiction, then much of the whole world is in trouble. Sexually, that is. Had Zoe been hanging around public restrooms to meet her conquests 5-6 times a day, then I would have believed in an addiction. <br />The book began wonderfully. From the middle to the end, I thought I was reading a rejected script from the Young and the Restless. It just got silly. The dialogue was stilted, the descriptive language was elementary, and the story lost any realism it started with. <br />By the way, In all Zoe's business success after only graduating from high school, no one ever encouraged her to further her education? How loving could her husband had been to further his own and not at least mention to her to get her's?	2002-03-13

The writing seemed to be okay and the dream sequences could have pulled a drowning attempt at a novel to safety, but it didn't. The characters lacked depth, there were too many holes in the plot and the main character didn't seem to know what she was doing. Ever. I flipped back to re-read parts because I was afraid I had missed something. It seemed as if the writer's mood was being reflected throughout the book. If she was in good spirits, then Amber and David got along. If not, Amber and Che tried to outdo each other with deceit and duplicity. Neither of them seemed to be the type you'd want for a friend. It was hard to like anybody in this book because you never knew who you'd be reading about from page to page. The characters weren't written in a way that you could get to know them and even at the most mundane points in the book the author felt she had to go back  10 years to explain something that had little or no relevance to the story at all. Only Toni Morrison can get away with that, but you best believe you don't win Nobel prizes doing it badly.	2002-03-04

However, the character that proved to be the most interesting was the one who was most warped. It had some interesting plot twists, but all in all was incredibly predictable. I figured out Shawna's secret as soon as she and Antoine hit it off so well. <br />Had the book been solely about Maurice, five stars wouldn't have been enough to rate it with.	2002-02-28

This one falls into the same category with me. He claims to want to help heal relationships when in actuality, I can see the open wounds in the author himself. Vulnerability is good in a good writer. It helps readers understand the characters as well as the writer. Mr. Baisden is failing in this area. You can almost hear the excuses he gives just before he portrays his female characters as desperate, easy, gullible, needy, nagging, suspicious and a plethora of other unflattering characteristics which seems to be a theme of his. Rather than make a statement for my review, I have a question. If the main character had been a woman, wouldn't she be called \\"The [prostitute]?\\"	2001-12-17

The book itself was pretty much common sense stuff, but quite entertaining. The anecdotes seemed a bit over the top and at times strained. Some parts even made me think I'd seen or heard about it from a movie somewhere so take it all with a grain of salt. It's good to take along on a road trip or for a simple diversion. The only thing the book did for me was decrease my interest and faith in monogamous relationships and confirmed my worst fears while bringing all my imagined worst case scenarios to the forefront of my mind. As a woman, it leads me to ask the question, &quot;Why should I even bother?&quot;	2001-12-10

Courage is what writes book. Now, writing a good book is another story. No pun intended. I thought this was a wonderful idea to reach out to the Brothers and let them know that not all women think they are dogs while at the same time illustrating that not all female writers portray them as such. Awesome idea. BAD story. I found the characters to be stilted, unimaginative and the writer seemed to be telling a story she WISHED were true rather than a story that MIGHT be true. Although it's fiction, reality does carry some weight. It was too soap opera-ish, and entirely too unrealistic. How many 6 or 7 year olds do any of us know that always do the right thing, are intuitive enough to immediately see the first signs of deception and always think of others before themselves? It's not a question of character, but maturity. Since the characters had God so deeply imbedded in their lives as well, and were thanking Him and realizing how blessed they were every other page, I found it odd that they had no problem fornicating on a regular basis. If it's going to be a dream book at least stick to the script. I was actually rooting for the &quot;bad girl&quot; in the middle of it. It has never taken me an entire month to read anything. That sterling record has been shattered in one fell swoop. I can only hope things get better. The best part was the end and I mean the end of the misery of reading it.	2001-04-10

I think this book made a statement about sisters and what we've gone through with our hair since we were brought to this country. I enjoyed Ms. Thomas' writing and the tack she took on the subject without losing the characters or being too heavy handed with social commentary. This is what I call a &quot;Make-Up-Your-Own-Mind&quot; kind of book. She left something for the reader to think about and come to their own conclusions and that's the whole purpose. Wonderful read.	2001-04-10

His skills are not lacking at all. There just wasn't anything else we so feverishly needed to know about the main character. Some things are better left unsaid, or in this case; unread. Not everyone can crank out a masterpiece everytime they go out for one.  I have to say that I have never been so disappointed. The dialogue was strained. The characters, including Raheema (my favorite from Flyy Girl) had no depth. The main character almost made me hate her completely with her numerous self-contradictions. It was almost as if the writer couldn't decide if he wanted her to BE fly or PLAY at being fly. Nonetheless, I will continue to be on the lookout for more of Brother Tyree's work. Best of luck, always.	2001-02-19
