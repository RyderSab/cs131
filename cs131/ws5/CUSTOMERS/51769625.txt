After reading a few books about the war, I became interested in the effects of the war on Japan.  I chose a few books about it at random, and Takemae Eiji's \\"The Allied Occupation of Japan\\" was one of them. This edition is a revision of an earlier work entitled \\"Inside the GHQ.\\"  This edition is completely revised, and apparently written for western audiences. It is valuable in that unlike many books on the subject, this one was written by a Japanese scholar rather than a western one.<br /><br />From the early postwar days, to the end of the Occupation, to more recently, Takemae Eiji attempts to chronicle McArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ), the evolution of the Allied occupation of Japan, the changes and effects it enacted on Japanese politics and culture, and the long term effects that those changes have had.  Likewise, it studies the failures of the occupation, the promises it made and did not complete, and the long term effects they have had on Japanese development.<br /><br />Indeed, other aspects of the Occupation, such as differences from the German occupation are fascinating.  Japan, unlike Germany, was occupied mainly by the United States, but the Occupation did not take control completely, instead, using the structure of the Japanese government to get things done. Indeed interesting is the fancy footwork around the subject of the Emperor, which was far more complex and convoluted than I ever guessed.<br /><br />The depth of this book is astounding, and indeed, a bit overwhelming at times. This is not a book for the light reader. It's filled with military acronyms and delves deeply into the organization and methods of the GHQ and the Allied occupation. The surplus of names, divisions, and organizations that all fit under the umbrella of the GHQ are mind boggling for those not familiar with the subject.<br /><br />Still, if a person is willing to plow through it, there is an extraordinary depth of information that slowly begins to build a picture of Japan, both old and new, culturally and politically.<br /><br />Eiji, who was a young man at the end of the war, writes with a passion for his subject, focussing on the profound influence the Occupation had on Japan, from enfranchisement for women, the abandonment of the military power cliques, to educational reform and the failed attempt to remove militarism from Japan entirely. Eiji is clearly a believer in the early reforms of the Occupation, and through his writing, one gets the impression he mourns the loss of uncompleted reforms originally intended for Japan.<br /><br />And truly, it is easy to see where he gets his passion from. The original occupation's intended goals would have changed Japan far beyond the end results. The immediacies of the Cold War and infighting within the Occupation itself stalled changes and reforms that would have revolutionized Japanese culture far more than the end result.<br /><br />This is a great book, if a bit deep.  Students of Japanese culture would be well advised to give it a look because the Occupation, if only a footnote in the minds of many in the west, was a profound and life changing event for most Japanese.the subject.   <br /> <br />Still, if a person is willing to plow through it, there is an extraordinary depth of information that slowly begins to build a picture of Japan, both old and new, culturally and politically. <br /> <br />Eiji, who was a young man at the end of the war, writes with a passion for his subject, focussing on the profound influence the Occupation had on Japan, from enfranchisement for women, the abandonment of the military power cliques, to educational reform and the failed attempt to remove militarism from Japan entirely.

US	51769625	R1TFJXJLKRHHW1	074347161X	357567884	Digital Knight	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Digital Knight - A pretty good first time novel	Synopsis<br />Digital Knight is a series of stories narrated by the book's hero, Jason Wood, a private detective/computer geek/accidental paranormal expert. The stories chronicle his adventures as he, along with his close lady friend and psychic Sylvie, stumble into the world of the not so normal, and find that it's even more not so normal than they'd ever expected.  Strange things abound, from real-live werewolves, to a vampire who is older than anyone expects to an ancient myth that turns out to be true... sort of.<br />About the Book:<br />A first work for its author, Digital Knight is an interesting book in that it represents a body of work that shows how an idea can evolve over time.  Clearly, Mr. Spoor didn't originally intend the characters to take the course they did, based on the first couple stories alone.  What appears to be a simple series of stories involving vampires and werewolves and paranormal such things, turns into a strange albeit entertaining alternate mythology with a lot more in it than simple vamps.<br />The evolution of the idea turns out not to be that bad of a thing. Spoor manages to take the clich&eacute;s' of these old wives' tale bad guys and creates something entirely different and unique, albeit far fetched at times.  The effect is such that the reader makes discoveries at the same pace as the author and characters do.  It makes for a fun read. Ultimately, the stories easily keep your interest throughout, and a number of the characters are interesting enough to make you care about what happens to them.<br />Be warned though, if you're looking at this book for traditional vampire/werewolf series of stories, these are not them.  Digital Knight is more sci-fi related than traditional folk-lore. Likewise, if you're looking for hard, deep sci-fi stories, you won't find them here, though this certainly qualifies as both sci-fi and Fantasy. Spoor's Digital Knight stories read more like detective short stories, while being light on the detective part.<br />Overall, this is a fun read, and a pretty good entry for a first time author. I'm looking forward to a follow-up to Digital Knight or other books from Spoor.<br />Overall, this is a fun read, and a pretty good entry for a first time author.

US	51769625	RDL9TXSHOCNWD	074347158X	32305456	The Far Side of the Stars	Books	4	9	10	N	N	More fun from the RCN	The RCN (Republic of Cinnabar Navy) series revolves around Lt. David Leary, a politician's son, who entered the navy to get away from his father and politics.  Leary proves to be an able commander and an expert tactician... and something of a womanizer. The series also follows Adele Mundy, the only survivor of a political massacre of her family.  She is a computer wiz who's so good it's not exactly believable.  In many ways, the books are seen through her eyes as she begins to emerge from the shell she created when her family was killed.<br />The Far Side of the Stars follows Lt. Leary and Adele Mundy to the weak Confederacy of the Galactic North in the newly decommissioned and sold Princess Cecile.  With the war between the Republic of Cinnabar and the Alliance now over,  Leary leaves the navy and is hired by eccentric nobles from a far off planet. With the crew of the Cecile and Adele in tow, they head out into rough territory in search of the Earth Diamond, a diamond said to hollowed and to contain the continents of the earth inscribed on the inside.  Adele has a dual purpose, courtesy of Cinnabar intelligence, find out if an Alliance base has been built in the Confederacy.<br />The result is a search across numerous planets for the jewel, a confrontation with Alliance pirates and finally a discovery that may just see the end of the Princess Cecile and her crew.<br />~*~<br />Despite his obvious skill at writing, David Drake has never been one of my favorite authors.  Many of his books, perhaps colored by his experience as a combat veteran of Vietnam, are grim with a dark sort of humor about them.<br />The RCN series, of which The Far Side of the Stars is the third book, is refreshingly different than many of his other books.  For one thing, the tone is lighter, and the characters, at least some of them, have a feel about them that is very unlike many of Drake's earlier novels.  While it contains some of the darker view of life that Drake is well known for, there is a sort of optimism in the characters that seems refreshing for his writing.<br />To the Far Side of the Stars, like the previous novels in the series, is at points a little over the top.  Adele is such a computer wiz that it's unbelievable.  But despite this, it does manage to easily follow in the tradition and mood of the previous novels.  It's a classic adventure story, sort of a cross between star Trek and Honor Harrington.<br />Lt. Leary remains his indomitable self throughout the novel.  But Adele Mundy is where this story seems to focus.  I've always enjoyed her character. She is alone in the universe, with no personal attachment left, and then with Lt. Leary showing her friendship, she begins to change.  In this novel, she grows significantly.  Her shell begins to crack and a hint of something growing between her and Lt. Leary is revealed.<br />I rather enjoyed this novel.  It, along with the other books in the series is a great deal of fun.  I just wish that Drake would take less time to come out with novels in the series.is a sort of optimism in the characters that seems refreshing for his writing.<br />To the Far Side of the Stars, like the previous novels in the series, is at points a little over the top.

US	51769625	R1H8VC58WR0B37	0441848303	795787338	Northworld	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Mediocre book from a usually entertaining author	Northworld is the story of Nils Hanson, a police officer of sorts in a vast space empire. He is dragooned by the Consensus, the leaders of the empire, into investigating the disappearances of a colony called Northworld.  Hanson goes as he is forced to, and gets caught up in a bizarre series of worlds where technology and magic are combined, created by the gods, the original survey team that found Northworld in the first place.<br />Northworld is an ambitious book, attempting to weave sci-fi and fantasy into one unit, following Hanson in a somewhat militaristic story.  It's an interesting read, but it lacks cohesiveness and at times is confusing and hard to follow as the main character bounces from one world to the next with no apparent cause or reason.  Meanwhile, the book halfheartedly follows from the point of view of the gods as they manipulate the worlds they rule and each other. What exactly was going on got lost in the shuffle.<br />Northworld isn't that great a book. Maybe with the other books in the series it would make a bit more sense, but standing alone, I was left scratching my head and wishing for my reading time back.  I'm not going to be investigating the other books in the series as a result.<br />Certainly Drake has written far better books than this.  Check out \\"With the Lightnings,\\" another Drake book instead. It's far more cohesive and entertaining than this book.	2003-03-01

It sounds like a very good idea.<br />Unfortunately, Kacirk botched the execution of it and what resulted was a very subpar and mostly uninteresting collection of word definitions.  That's it, just definitions.  The worst part is, usage dates (dates the words might have been in use) contextual quotes and word origins weren't even included.<br />Well, actually, usage dates were included, by way of the name of an author who used it, that you had to go and look up in a glossary at the back of the book.  Talk about unnecessarily cludgy and annoying.<br />Ok, the origin of words is a bit complex to research for a book, but the other two shouldn't have been that difficult.  Had Kacirk actually put the usage dates along with the definitions, and included a contextual quote (most of the authors were before 1900 so copyrights wouldn't be an issue), this book would have been far more interesting and worth spending money on.	2002-01-19

A Hymn Before Battle is the first in what is bound to be the first in a long series of books about huanities forced alliance with a feudalistic federation of aliens, and their war against another group of aliens known as the Poslien.  Humans, happening to be the only race in the Alliance that is willing or capable of fighting a war become cannon fodder, against the Poslien who have an interesting habit of using their POWs for food.<br />It is in a very real sense strictly military science fiction.<br /><br />A Hymn Before Battle is not the first John Ringo book I've read.  Before this one, I read the the books he co-authored with David Weber, March Upcountry and March To The Sea.  I did not give either of those books very high marks mainly because in their attempt to create military Sci-fi, they forgot about Characters, plot, and the fact that Aliens probably would act, well, Alien.<br />Unlike the aforementioned novels, this one managed to keep my attention throughout, though it did not avoid all of the complaints I had about the other novels.  The character development is shaky at best.  While I have no military experiance, I found some of what the characters did and their reactions to certain situations to be contrived and unbelievable.<br />The alien tactics however, and human responce  to them seem to be well thought-out. Unlike the aliens in the aforementioned novels, the Poslien truly do seem to think in an alien fashion about warfare.  I do think we could have done without the &quot;Poslien point of view&quot; snippits in the way they were presented, as they only serve to humanize the threat, and weaken its overall impact.<br />Overall, A Hymn Before Battle is entertaining and imaginative.  I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who isn't into military fiction (the death count in the book ranges into the millions, if you count all the aliens as well as humans), but if you enjoy books by David Weber, David Drake, Heinlien, and the like, you'll probably enjoy this one.e.	2002-01-13

It relates the fascinating tale of the development and fight between the two great ironclads and their meeting on March 9, 1862.<br />William C. Davis is both a historian and a storyteller.  He expertly weaves memoir and journal accounts from actual participants to reveal a human side to what many would consider 'dry' history.  That Monitor and Virginia were the first Ironclads to meet in battle is notable.  But it is the men who commanded those ships, fired their guns and worked their engines who were behind it all.  Davis expertly captures that and brings it to life.  It is this mesh of human drama and military might that makes this book so valuable.<br />Then there's the fact that it is simply well written, well paced and just entertaining.  While this subject has been covered before in countless books on Civil War Naval history and military, none I have seen has gone into this much depth, both for the human side and the historical background.<br />I really enjoyed this one.  I think it's written well enough that I could suggest this book to just about anyone who has an interest in military history, or just likes a good story.	2001-10-31

If you don't want to be spoiled, don't read further.<br /><br />The Skies of Pern takes up shortly after Avias and Masterharper Robinton die.  Pern is seeing a technological rebirth with the revelation of the technology stored by Avias, and the days of the thread are coming to an end.  The book explores the concern that the dragonriders have about their future employment, and the 'unwashed' elements of society who want to destroy the progress of Avias.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed Anne McCaffrey's work.  Pern has never been my favorite of her series, but I've read just about every novel in it.  When I heard that \\"The Skies of Pern\\" had come out, I decided to give it a go.  I sort of wish I hadn't, well at least not in hardback.<br /><br />\\"The Skies of Pern\\" is a singularly uneven piece of fiction.  While it is decently written, there were too many things going on to keep track very well.  The jumping about made me lose interest quickly.  I prefer a solid storyline that is cohesive.  This novel sort of lacked that. It took me a week to finish this one, which is not normal for me.<br /><br />The whole plot line felt way too contrived and convenient to me.  The Dragonriders are worried about future employment... and WHAM.  A new crisis comes out of nowhere and solves all their problems.  \\"Yay!  We'll all do that now.\\"<br /><br />The problem was wrapped up far too easily.  With a little more work, McCaffrey could have extensively explored the plight that the dragonriders now faced.  There were a lot of sociological questions there.  Tied in with the fight to rid Pern of the 'evil' progress of Avias and the plight of the dragonriders no longer having a vital job to sustain them, there could have been a very interesting story to explore.<br /><br />Instead, the convenient \\"out of nowhere\\" problem is used to fix it all and everything is solved in 450 pages.  As I said, far too contrived.  McCaffrey dropped the ball on this one I think. It's a shame because there really was so much potential there for her to explore.  In the end, the whole novel falls flat and is mediocre at best.<br /><br />I'd say that if you enjoy the Pern series or McCaffrey, you'll enjoy this.  But wait for paperback before you buy it.opped the ball on this one I think. It's a shame because there really was so much potential there for her to explore.

First off, I want to say that I'm a huge David Weber fan, so naturally I devour his books like potato chips.  I've read every book he's written and quite a few of the shorter stories that have appeared in anthologies.  I love this guy!<br />Usually, David Weber's writing is right on, creating whole universes with imaginative merging of character, technology and action.  This formula has made him an extremely popular author, and rightly so.<br />In Death Ground however falls short of his usual excellence.  Based in the Starfire universe (in which other such books as Crusade and Insurrection are set), it follows a human federation's war against an insidious and non-understandable alien race.<br />Sounds good at first glance, but unfortunately, this book was a little too disjointed for my taste.  There were a great number of sub-characters who showed up once and disappeared.  That's all good and fine, but the sheer amount of them was overwhelming, and I for one like to see characters reoccur and develop over time.  A few did, but that was the exception not the norm.<br />To make matters worse, the action got pretty disjointed at times.  I found myself losing track of exactly what was going on.  I got overwhelmed and had to set the book down.<br />The next book (this is the first volume in two about this war) comes out in the near future (of this review).  I'm hoping that it is more carefully crafted.<br />I can't really recommend In Death Ground.  If you enjoy David Weber, go for it, But my advice is to try 'Path of the Fury,' 'Insurrection,' or any of the earlier Honor Harrington novels if you haven't read him before.  Any of those books are far better than this one.	2001-10-27

This is the book that started it all for me.  I picked it up in a library years ago back in 1994, and I've been an avid fan of David Weber ever since.  I can't hold back recommending this book to any reader who might see this review.  Now if we can convince him to write a sequal...<br />&quot;Path of the Fury&quot; follows retired Imperial Commando Alicia DeVries and her search for vengence against the pirates who murdered her family and gutted the planet she had made her home.  She is helped, by the mystical and self-serving Tisiphone, one of the long lost Furies of Greek legend.  Their quest leads them to steal an artificially intelligent ship and... well, why spoil it.<br />Weber has a unique way of creating universes that have extrodinary depth and complexity, while at the same time intertwining character development and action flawlessly.  It is the depth that makes David Weber such a good author.  This book shows all of his best qualities, and could easily be called the best of what he's written.  He's an ever more popular author.  This book shows why.<br />I can't recommend it enough to those who haven't read it.  Give it a read, you won't regret it.	2001-10-27

They use genetically manipulated humans called Trolls to fight for them.<br />Apocolypse Troll follows one woman from the future, and one troll as one works to take over the world, and the other works to stop it... in the early 21st century.<br />Although I'm a huge fan of David Weber, I must admit that many of his books of late have not been up to snuff.  His earliest works, &quot;Path of the Fury,&quot; &quot;On Basalisk Station&quot; and others appeal to me the most.  I feel many of his later works (the later Honor books and the latest books he's co-authored) have lost something. What it is, I'm not sure.<br />That said, this particular book found it again.  There was a freshness there that caught me off guard.  The character interactions were believeable, and it had a flowing, continuous story line that made it hard to put down the book.  When I read this book, I felt like I did when I read &quot;Path of the Fury&quot; or Mutineer's Moon.&quot;  Excitment and all the good things that come with a well crafted story.<br />It's probably not the most original book, but it's fun. I really, really liked this one.  For the military Sci-fi fan, this one's a gem.	2001-10-26

While it is geared for the modern navy, a good many antiquated terms (from the age of sail) are in it as well, though not all.<br />While the &quot;Naval Terms Dictionary&quot; is a great tool, I have found a few drawbacks to it.  While it is set up alphabetically like a normal dictionary, it completely lacks any sort of pronunciation guide for words (some of those terms are pronounced funny) and a listing of what type of word it is (noun, verb, adj, etc).  It also neglects to seperate different definitions for the words, opting to give both in a paragraph form. You can usually define the type of word it is from the definition, but it would have been a little more professional to write it in a standard dictionary format.<br />Overall, despite its relatively minor flaws, this book is a great tool for folks who are in the navy, or read a lot of naval history and fiction.	2001-10-11

I lived in Zambia for a good part of my life and picked up my copy of the book there.<br />\\"Tales of Zambia\\" is a collection of 86 separate short vignettes about Zambian history, culture, nature and natural wonders. It is illustrated with a great number of photographs. In my copy, they're all black and white. I'm not sure if the hardcover is the same.<br />Among the stories, there are short accounts of grass burning in the bush to catch rodents, the establishment of the Munda-Wanga Botanical Gardens outside of Lusaka, the Chirundu Fossil Forest (now mostly destroyed by neglect and ravaging tourists), and the Livingstone Memorial where Dr. David Livingston was buried. There are also accounts of the discovery of Victoria Falls and the amazing disaster and recovery during the Mufulira copper mine Collapse in the 1970's.<br />For the most part, I think this a book that would appeal to people who have lived in Zambia, or have a distinct interest in this region of Africa. As I said, the vignettes are of a very nostalgic nature and have their greatest appeal for someone familiar with the country.<br />I myself enjoyed the book greatly. It reminded me of home.	2001-10-11

My copy of this book is a hardback, and humorously enough, on the copywrite page in big capital letters, it says &quot;FIRST EDITION.&quot; Ms. Banbury is no Jack London. As much as her book revolves around a first edition of one of his books, her skill has a long way to go before she even gets close to his.<br />I have to admit that this book was a waste of money for me. Thankfully I got it at a used bookstore. It's a very nice copy though, in &quot;cherry&quot; condition (as the protagonist called the London Book). Too bad I'll only get 25 cents for it when I sell it back.<br />The story starts out fairly well, revolving around the pessamistic and annoyingly cynical Jill, a woman who works (not very hard or well) at a used bookstore in LA. One day, a dwarf walks in and sells a signed first-edition Jack London edition of &quot;The Cruise of the Snark&quot; for 25 bucks. She then, like a bit of an idiot sells it to a former child movie-star named Tim for $400.<br />The dwarf comes back with a huge guy and demands it back... or else. Turns out that said book is especially valuable. And it all goes downhill from there as off the protagonist goes on a wild (and incredibly hard to follow) goose chase to try to get that stupid book back, being sarcastic, cynical and just plain annoying the whole time.<br />I won't even go into the wierd characters she interacts with, characters who act like something out of a bad mobster movie spoof. It probably figures, since all the bad guys were actors.<br />I couldn't stand the dialog either. In truth, the protagonist was such a cynical and sarcastic (not to mention incredibly self-centered) pain in the rear end that I felt almost no sympathy or any care of what happened to her. Of course, the commically stereotypical Marx brothers bad guys were even worse, so I was forced to root for the lesser of two evils. After a while, I said to heck with it and went to bed instead.<br />Over all, in my ranking of 1 to 5, this book gets a 2 (A generous score actually).  To be fair though, I do prefer protagonists I can identify with. Jill was too much of a jerk to be likable.generous score actually).  To be fair though, I do prefer protagonists I can identify with.

It is not really intended as a &quot;history&quot; of piracy (as some seem it think), rather it explores the reality behind the popular conception our society has of pirates and piracy itself, the innaccuriacies that have crept into their pop image.<br />Even from the later days of piracy, authors such as Robert Louis Stevenson have presented a slightly romanticized image of pirates.  Authors that followed him added until the truth of piracy was partially obscured.  Cordingly achieves his goal of decifering the romanticism and it's orgins quite well through the course of the book, explaining the structure of the pirate world, how they operated, what sort of men and prizes they went after, and where many of the misconceptions of Pirates may have come from. The book is filled with many interesting anecdotes and stories about specific pirates and the authors who wrote about them.<br />The main problem I had with this book was simply the fact that it was dry.  While it had some sections that were fascinating and kept my attention easily, other parts were boring.  It was clearly intended as more of light read, yet at times I felt like I was plowing through a more scholarly piece of work.  I had to force myself to get through them at times.  What results is an inconsistant read.<br />That said, I would still recomend this book to people interested in pirates.  While there are other books that have more on specific pirates and specific events, this book is a fairly decent overview, and its analysis on the development of the pop culture image of pirates is invaluable.	2001-10-10

It was at the time a evelation for me, and the source of my now great love for Naval History.  I owe Stephen Howarth a debt of thanks.<br />I recently picked up a copy of this edition.  It has been extended from 1991 (where the previous edition ended) and now includes &quot;The Gulf War&quot; and a few other events up to 1998.  There may have been a few other changes that I am not aware of.<br />I've read quite a few one book histories of the US Navy, ranging from books published in the 1920's (and actually used at Anapolis) to books that have been published in the past few years.  Howarth's &quot;To Shining Sea stands among the best of them, simply for its informative and enteratining style.<br />Howarth treats his subject not only with the eye of a scholar, but also with the eye of a storyteller, while at the same time, making interesting and intelligent observations about his subject.  What results is a book that is entertaining and informative at the same time.  His own enthusiasm for his subject is infectious as one reads it.<br />Most interesting about this book is that Howarth examines the US Navy, not from an American's eyes, but those of an Briton.  Interspiced throughout the book are accounts of what the sentaments in England were towards the United States and it's tiny Navy.  The addition is illuminating and welcome.<br />If you have a passing interest in the US Navy and it's history, or simply want to get your feet wet in the subject, &quot;To Shining Sea&quot; is well worth the read.	2001-10-10

I don't doubt that it would come in useful.  It's a true treasure trove of information concerning the United States Navy's unique culture.<br /><br />The best part is the fact that it goes extensively into the backgrounds of many of the traditions and customs the Navy is steeped in.  It is a scholarly book on history as much as it is about custom and tradition.<br /><br />As a person not in the navy but with an interest in its history, this book was entertaining and informative.  If you're interested in such things, \\"Naval Ceremonies, Customs, and Traditions\\" is definitely worth a look.	2001-10-10

It is the first book I've seen to cover this subject in the depth that it deserves.  The midget sub, while perhaps not the most glamourous (or successful) of tools to be used in past wars, did make it's impact.  It's story is filled with the stories of many heroic men, most of whom fought for the Axis in WWII.<br />Underwater Warriors begins with the inception of the Submarine, (and incidentally, the first 'One man' sub) in David Bushnell's &quot;Turtle,&quot; a wooden clumbsy thing, experimented with by the revolutionary United States in 1776.  Kemp follows the history and evolution of the mini-sub through to the modern day, and makes some conclusions about the military applications and future use of midget subs.  His final conclusion is that midget subs are a good idea, but not if only one man is operating them.<br />The book itself is filled with many accounts of individuals, who worked with midget subs.  It becomes clear that these pioneering men truly did exemplify what heroism really is.  Since Midget subs have never been a major tool of war, I don't doubt that Kemp has included most of the accounts that were available to be written.  What results is an entertaining read, filled with much human drama.<br />The one downside, at least for me, is that the book lapses into large sections covering the technical aspects of the submarines themselves, including variations, dimentions and minor technical changes.  I suppose it is to be expected given a subject that is not extremely broad.  That said however, I found myself skipping over the more technical parts to get to the human interest sections.<br />Overall, this book is well worth the read for millitary history enthusiasts, Naval history enthusiasts and folks who just like the idea of a &quot;Midget-sub.&quot;	2001-10-10

That's why this book popped off the shelf into my hands.  If one can get past the doubious cover art and blurb on the back (Rommel with the Persians... Patton at bull run? Nope, they're not in THIS book), it's not too terrible.<br />A few of the stories are downright rotton.  Some of those same stories are so obscure it makes them uninteresting.  Others are so-so, and a number of others are top notch.  It's a shame that the selection wasn't more carefully managed.<br />The best of the bunch in my opinion, which make the book worth reading just for those stories are:<br />-The Charge of Lee's Brigade,<br />-Billy Mitchel's Overt act - (The best in the book, and totally worth a read)<br />-A Case for Justice<br />-Vive L'Amiral<br />-Bloodstained Ground<br />Billy Mitchel's Overt Act, by William Sanders is the best of the bunch.  It's a shame that most of the rest didn't match up to its quality.<br />Bottom line, some of the stories aren't bad, but most are mediocre.	2001-10-10

It is a fairly complete overview of the basic knowledge an officer must be familiar with, covering just about everything from splicing rope/cable and the use of pulleys to the organization of watches and ship command.<br />One of the great things about this book is its liberal use of diagrams.  The book is peppered with them, and their placement does a great deal to make the sometimes very complex content more readable and understandable.<br />I'm sure there are newer editions out since this one (I believe there's one named \\"Annapolis Guide to Seamanship\\" or something similar), but as it is, I found \\"Seamanship\\" quite informative and even useful.<br />It certainly helped me understand the body of knowledge a deck officer must be comfortable with... and I learned something too.  I now know how to keep rope in good condition and can splice a wire cable correctly.  Yay for me!	2001-10-10

For one, it chronicals the life of the sailor, from the press gangs to life at sea, the lives and duties of the officers, the convoluted and impossibly complex beaurocracy of the English Navy and the stresses involved in each of these.<br />The most amazing part of this book to me was the job of the Purser.  While, I had some basic idea of the intricacies involved in the job, Rodger took my understanding to a whole new level.  I was shocked at the detail, and the negatives to the job.  The Navy's beaurocracy was so complex that pursers had to do all of their purchasing on credit from their own pocket.  It often took them years and years to finally be repaid.  It was a job that you had to pretty much be independantly wealthy to do.  Of course, Rodgers also explains all the scams a purser could pull to make a little money on the side.<br />I'd strongely suggest this book to readers who have an interest in Naval history of the 18th century (1740-60's), or who are fans of that Genre of historical fiction (C.S. Forester, Patrick O'Brian, etc).  The book is filled with revelations like the one above. Together, they really give a greater depth to the world that history and those stories are set in.	2001-10-09

I read this book for a class, and while it was valuable simply for the insight it gave me into the nature of the Civil war and the things men went/go through, I had a few major complaints about this book.<br />Driscoll is a formor military man himself, and I believe his own experiances have strongly colored his image of what the 2nd Wisconsin (Baraboo guard) would have been like.  Problem is, the Culture of the 1990's is not the same as the 1860's.  Added to that was poor reasearch.<br />Wisconsin is a State with a strong German history (I live here and have German ancestors).  A great many German (and scandanavian) Lutherans and protestants settled there, fleeing from turmoil in Europe. It was from these folk that the Baraboo guard would have been formed.  Many of these people would have been very religous, and would have taken their faiths and their morallity seriously.<br />While I don't doubt that the stress of war would put preasures on men which would make them loosen a little on their morals, Driscoll didn't give them any morals to begin with.  The whole bunch of them were a lot of loud-mouthed swearing heathans, from day one to the end of the book, an image that is grossly inconsistant with the reality of Wisconsin at this time.<br />Another thing that bothered me was the Guard's Leautenant, going and having sex so readily with his love interest, and then her father knowing and not caring at all about it.  While this might be common in today's world, the world of the 1860's wasn't so forgiving to young society women who indulged in &quot;Free Love.&quot;<br />Getting past the gross historical cultural problems in this book, it was pretty historically accurate, and not an awful read.  I don't think I'd bother reading it again.	2001-10-09

It's clearly intended as a light read, not a deep scholarely work.  The writing style is light and informative.<br />Standage's thesis in the book is that the Telegraph was very much like the internet is today.  I think that in many ways, he was able to prove that thesis.  It was the beginning of instant mass communications, and it opened the world in ways that few other inventions have since.  There were even a few &quot;Online romances&quot; and marriages connected with the telegraph.<br />The book follows the developement of the telegraph from it's very early beginnings in the form of optical telegraphs, to the development of machine enhanced, and harmonic telegpahs, then lastly, the telephone.  As the book progresses, the development of the telegraph is interspaced with many interesting anecdotes that makes the book even more entertaining.<br />The only downside I can see for this book is the lack of decent endnotes or something similar.  I'm a fan of them, even if the book is intended as a light read.	2001-10-09

She's not the current Aircraft Carrier of that name either.<br />She's the first American naval vessel to hold the proud name Essex, which is still in use in the American Navy today.  Essex was one of America's first sailing frigates, and the vessel upon which one of the greatest stories of the War of 1812 took place.<br />There aren't many books out there that chronicle single ships in the early American navy. This alone, makes this book a gem. But it's value is further boosted by the fact that it is written in a gripping and entertaining narrative style. It is further valuable in the background it gives on the ship itself, the affairs of that day, and the people she was involved with.<br />The authors pull no punches as the weave a complex and instructive account of the ship's history and of her officers. Clearly, there were some bad eggs in there.<br />I strongly suggest this book to fans of historical fiction about this time period, or folks who are naval history buffs.	2001-10-09

He writes in a loving and non-confrontationsal way, that, while it is intended for Christians who wish to evangelize to Mormons, is clearly practicing what he promotes.<br />The thing to remember about this book is that it is written by a christian for Christians.  Rev. Cares was never a Mormon, but is a pastor in a predominantly Mormon community.  He has a great deal of first hand experiance.<br />In the book, Cares promotes Christian Love in evangelism, and tries to carefully explain Mormon thought, doctrine and conceptions.  The defining of the Mormon mindset is a great bonus in this book.  A lot of the problems people have in evangilizing to Mormons comes from the different definations Christians and Mormons have for key words in Their faiths.<br />I've used this book in my personal evangelizing to Mormons.  It has a been a huge asset.  I'd suggest it to any Christian who hopes or intends to be doing evangelism among Mormons.	2001-10-09

Captured during the War of 1812, she was the first English warship to be captured by the American Navy.  It was a stunning defeat for the powerful English navy and long held as a high moment in American military history. The Macedonian was brought into the US navy after her capture, instrumental to putting an end to the Barbary pirates, and even had a hand in the reopening of Japan to the world.     It is only fitting, therefore, that a biography would be written about her. De Kay's book, \\"Chronicles of the Frigate Macedonian\\" is an extremely entertaining read, one that well worth the time.  There aren't many single ship biographies out there about the American sailing navy, which makes this book a solid gem.    Chronicling the Macedonian from her construction of green timber in a shipyard in England, to her (What was left of her) final destruction in a fire in 1922, De Kay weaves a entertaining account of the ship, her glories and her more tarnished incidents.  The cast of character is diverse, ranging from the honorable John Carden, who lost the Macedonian to the USS United States and never commanded a ship again, to Commodore James Biddle, who's own tenure as Captain was filled with sickness and death on the ship, to \\"Commodore\\" George DeKay who successfully used the Macedonian to bring much needed food relief to an Ireland suffering from famine.    The Macedonian's history was filled with political intrigue, madmen, jealousy, courage, and death.  De Kay chronicles it all in vivid color, from the ship herself to the colorful cast that inhabited her.  If you enjoy the writings C.S Forester and Patrick O'Brian, I'd strongly suggest this book. Sometimes real history can be as entertaining as a fictional one.	2001-10-09

Though I don't often get into the nitty gritty of the construction of ships or the actual nature of contruction of the ship itself, I have found that Chappelle's &quot;History&quot; is a fantastic resource as one researches and reads about the American sailing navy.  I actually have a near-mint first edition copy of it which I value highly.<br />Chappelle was while he was alive, the foremost expert in the design and evolution of the American sailing Navy.  His knowledge and talent was put to good use in writing a book that is still commonly refered to by naval historians over 50 years since it was written.<br />I do not believe that many books of a similar nature have been written since, possibly because Chappelle was so thorough in his coverage of the subject when he wrote this book.<br />The book itself chronicals the evolution of the American sailing Navy, from colonial days, before there even was a navy, to the 1850's when steam began to take over.  It includes hundreds of diagrams of ships, illustrations, dimentions, and drawings.<br />So complete is his data, that I know of at least one modelmaker, who's used Chapelle's data extensively in construction of his models.<br />If you enjoy sailing, or American sailing Navy history, this book is definately worth a look.	2001-10-09

This one however, I sort of have to.<br />'March to the Sea' takes up where the previous book (March Upcountry) left off. Prince Roger and his marry band of Marines now half-way accross the continent from where they were stranded in the previous book, are desperately trying to cross trecherous alien swampland to get to the sea so they can cross an ocean and attack a foriegn-held spaceport.<br />My main complaint with this book is that, while it did take up where the previous book left off, and tried to involve the human characters with the aliens in a dynamic way, the whole thing came off as rather unconvincing. For one thing, here we have a whole planet full of aliens, with four arms and slime-covered skin, with a sky the rains constantly. And what are they like? They're surprisingly human. They think human, they act human, they talk like humans, using human expressions and ideas. Heck, lop off two arms and they might as well be human.<br />It's the worst when the marines reach the coast and act in joint military actions with the Mardukians. Everything that happens militarily is human, right down to &quot;Reinventing&quot; Mardukian firearms and tactics. There's nothing original, no alien aspect, no alien tactics or inovations or thoughts or twists. Why even have these aliens be alien at all if they're going to act and think just like humans? There would have been real potential for this book if the aliens actually HAD acted alien.<br />The plot isn't all that fresh either. It's that typical &quot;Have to get somewhere before our supplies run out&quot; story. To make matters worse, almost all the characters are little more than paper cutouts, with very little depth at all.<br />Overall, I got through the book ok, and I even enjoyed it. It's not that badly written to be honest, though everything listed above definately goes against it. Then again, I'll read anything with David Weber's name on it. to be honest, I really did feel like I'd read it before... in &quot;Hiers of Empire&quot; which I enjoyed much more than this one.<br />If you're looking for anything original or fresh, this is not the book to find it.

It's supposed to be a tale of coming of age, but to be honest, it sort of fell flat on it's face.<br />The book started out favorably, introducing the main players in a relatively dynamic way. Unfortunately, as soon as they touched the ground, it was almost non-stop action, and the potential chances for character development were missed. The reader is left with 2 dimentional cookie cutter cutouts of all the characters. I barely cared when someone died, because they were little more than red-shirted ensigns.<br />Most annoying was the poor use of the character Cord. The book spends 40 pages introducing him and from there, he's barely mentioned till near the end of the book. Here he's the first alien we meet and he's bloodsworn to the Prince, and we barely see him, what motivates him and why he's even important to the story.<br />I think the main problem is that it tried to go too far too quickly and it drowned the characters while it was doing it.<br />My advice, don't bother unless you're a Weber (or Ringo) fan. And if you do bother, at least wait till it's out in paperback.	2001-05-11

The problem for me was the use of child (s)exploitation and snuff to establish the bad guys. While the &quot;action&quot; was not described explicitely, and no characters were actually mistreated in such a manner, Lackey didn't hesitate to describe what WOULD happen, including how it would be done (without being too explicit of course). The use of snuff and child exploitation as a plot device definately left me cold. Perhaps that was the intention. I felt it was out of place. Instead of making me agry at the antagonist, it made me angry at the author. It's one thing if it's social allegory. It's totally another when it's in a novel written for entertainment value, one that will probably be read by young teens (There's a nice letter to runaway children in the back suggesting places to go for help, but it still left me cold). If you think it won't bother you, go for it. It's not a bad story, and the bad guys get punished (for the most part). But be warned.	2001-05-11

It is written in a style that is easy to follow, and touches on all aspects of the CSN from shipbuilding, to supply to espionage. Reading this book gave me a full image of the odds going against the CSN and the amazing accomplishments they achieved despite them.<br />Luraghi is clearly enthusiastic about his subject.  His enthusiasm resonates throughout the book.  It is clear that he admires the CSN for it's acomplisments despite the incredible odds.<br />In addition, the sheer amount of research he must have done is breathtaking.  The endnotes take up more than 1/3 of the printed pages.  What's interesting is that many of the endnotes are annoted with comments about the sources from the author.  In my own research, those annotations have been a great asset.<br />This is definately a MUST read for the Civil War naval history buff.	2001-01-27
