US	32732316	R2CL4EB40H7HXT	1573223026	929884077	A Long Way Down	Books	5	2	6	N	N	Back to his Best	This is about four different people who meet on New Years Eve at a locally famous rooftop suicide spot. How they get to know and support each other after their collective failure to jump off. How they try to get used and deal with the idea of each of them living on. It's all told in the first person with each of them taking turns to move the story on. There isn't that much of a story, the entertainment comes from Hornby using his characters as vehicles for bringing his views on things to you the reader. These views can be funny or insightful or both and because of the nature of the novel being suicide and depression and lack of hope- I found the book so intense that sometimes I HAD to put it down almost to allow myself to ingest the emotions before continuing the next day. Hornby has a terrific voice, knowledgeable and funny and he struggled now and then to keep HIS voice out of all the characters. There's no wasted pages, no filler material at all though the book does lose it's impetus a little as you get through it- I'm not sure if this was me getting used to the subject matter or if Hornby loses his way a bit. Luckily though, it was just good enough in the end to merit the five stars. Original, well written and an easy but intense read.	2005-10-09

'Bridget Jones with attitude' indeed. It started well but wasn't really written in Diary form- anymore than practically any story written in the first person is a diary. You get the occasional start of a chapter like 'Wednesday Morning 20th' but what follows is first person prose. From the first it grips you for a few pages with tales of our heroine and a friend on a job with a 'John'. But it just seems to go nowhere and the little amount of porn in it becomes boring, just like most porn. The book obviously has the selling point and so they make the quick buck but in the long term I don't think books like this are good for the industry. If someone buys it to read on a flight or a train journey, next time they'll take a gameboy instead. I found the premise of a girl wanting to be a callgirl from the age of fourteen unbelievable. The author tries to make it work but it didn't for me. I understand that most girls get into this via drugs or poverty or abuse and part of me found this rose-tinted picture the authoress was painting a little offensive. I think there's so much suffering in the world of prostitution but you don't see it here. The only downside is the narrator worrying if her straight boyfriend will find out. There's no drugs, no pimps, no really dodgy clients, everything's just fine. The other characters all seemed like caricatures - you know, there's the mad one, the prim one, the matriarchal Madame. Well, at least they got my money from me- well done to them for that!	2005-09-25
US	32732316	RAZKE9WYSWEHF	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Brilliant but copied	A few years ago Yann Martel read a review by John Updike on a Brazillian book entitled Max and the Cats. The book was about a jewish zookeeper in 1933 who was migrating to escape the nazi's . His ship sunk and he ended up in a lifeboat with a black panther (which represented naziism). Martell then tried to buy the book but there was no trace (Updike criticised it). Martell felt aggrieved that it was such a great idea to be poorly executed and go out of print. Anyway a few years later, in India, he realised in a moment of inspiration, how he could write a great book with it. This is Martells account of how life of Pi came to be. <br />   The book concerns a young lad of sixteen call Piscene Molitar Patel and is set in India. When the ship capsizes Pi is left on board a lifeboat with a zebra, orang utan, a hyena and a tiger. There is no doubt it is a great book. The first half of it concerns knowledge of animals. i.e. Zoomorphism and how animals behaviour can be logical if you understand it- like rhinos sharing a compound with goats etc. Also, we are told a bit about lion-taming and the animal psycology behind it. All of this non-fiction type stuff has a point, as you will find out later on in the book. What I liked was that everything seemed to have a point later on. There a gory bits and sad bits in the book and it was extremely compelling. I just loved it- I didn't know about Max and the Cats until afterwards. I'm not sure if The Booker Prize panel knew about it. But even though it's not quite as original as some obviously think (after looking at reviews) I still loved it and would recommend it.	2005-09-18

Apparantly this won the Booker Prize in 1999 but God knows how. It was my sister who recommended it and she loved it so what I'm about to say is my opinion only (especially after reading some of the other reviews). I felt this was really a novella of about 100-150 pages with filler material to the extent of 250 pages taking the form of an art history lesson. If, like my sister, you like this sort of thing then you'll love the book. I don't know (or care) how factual the art history is. All I know was that all the art history made the book plod along. <br />   It's about a guy, and not a very likeable one either, who thinks he's discovered a lost masterpiece by Breugal/ Breughal, Shmegal or whoever it is. Our Hero (can't remeber his name)tries to con it out of the owner and excuse himself in the process while trying not to let his greed wreck his own marriage. That's the plot for what it's worth. I would have liked more about his marriage and his base instincts delved into by MF rather than the history lesson which seemed to leave my brain as soon as it entered it. For an attempted farce it was very short on laughs as well but again, when you lecture the reader on art for so long he/she is hardly going to be in the frame of mind for a laugh, no matter how hard the author may try. <br />   But, like I said it has its fans so it's a love or hate book. And I hated it.	2005-09-05

The result is a short story (a couple of hundred pages perhaps) and just loads of what I see as filler matierial. The book centres around Penelope Keeling who is sixty- four and the daughter of an artist who's work went for pennies while he was alive but now goes for thousands (early 1980's). Penelope has a handful of his work left including The Shell Seekers. Two of her three kids, Nancy and Noel, selfishly want the painting sold and a third, Olivia, doesn't care. At first when I began reading this book I was excited- I saw several hundred pages in front of me and thought 'Wow, this is gonna be good'. Little did I know that basically that was it! The author went back in time to WW2 and beyond to build up depth of character for Penelope and to stop us, perhaps from seeing her as just an old woman. What I have a big problem with in the book are questions I think the author did not intend. That is mainly Olivia who is written about as being special to Penelope, more so than Noel or Nancy, and the author excuses it. But I know that in real life siblings pick up on this. Nancy and Noel were portrayed as shallow monsters but I can hardly blame them if they've grown up feeling second best to Olivia. The author does put a little word-service into Olivia not being perfect herself with her 'I'm alright, Jack' attitude towards her siblings. Penelope doesn't seem to realise that if Nancy and Noel aren't what she'd hoped for then Penelope herself has failed them. But all of this really could have been done in just a couple of hundred pages but then her publishers wouldn't have got their longer book. One more thing, trying not to spoil anything, one character has a so-called life shattering illness- but it isn't. I know people with the illness and, really, for most it's no big deal, and the character would be one of the most. I so wanted this book to be a good'un, and thought it would be at the start but I'm afraid it was light, and boring and empty I just can't recommend it.	2005-09-04

I read his first (and best) book The Restraint of Beasts a few weeks ago and have hungrilly read the others since. This one The Scheme.. is a clever mickey-take on our public sectors (civil service and councils) which of course are paid for by taxes from the productive private sector. Politicians in our real world are always trying to cut back/down-size the public sector as many facets of it are just money pits. I work in the private sector and for a while our attitudes mirrored those in The Scheme and we nearly went under. We changed, lost people, became efficient and survived and competed in the private market. What Mills shows us here is how, with the lack of private competition, these people just can't change. They'll strike if the beurocrats downsize, strike if they're asked to work a full day etc. This is why Thatcher in the eighties was privatizing left, right and centre-work and produce or go under. Give us value for money for our taxes. Oh yes, the politicians know about the attitudes behind The Scheme. This is a very clever book. My only gripe was it just wasn't as entertaining as his first two books. It's all very well being clever but I really would like more fun, hence just the three stars this time. I didn't like the comment by the narrator about the two different sides- The Full- Dayers (those that want to work a full day) and The Early Swervers (those that want to slope off early) saying they were bickering and hence blaming both of them instead of just The Early Swervers- It's a bit like blaming two boys for fighting when one had been picking on the other. But I did like how after the strike, certain people obviously realised The Scheme wasn't needed. I know we've had redundancies at my work when certain people have been off sick a long time and have not been missed at all, you just think 'what are they for? Why do we need them? Yes, a very clever book but light on the entertainment side.	2005-08-13

For me the dominating factor of the book isn't the warring parts as far as 'Market-Garden' or 'The Battle of the Bulge' is concerned but the human tragedy of the civilians. The POW'S, the starving dutch, the raped and murdered East Prussians- the young boys picking up guns to fight and die for the lost Reich at the end. The displaced, the suffering and the dead millions. The megolamania displayed by the likes of Hitler and Stalin comes across strongly in the book in the form of treating thousands of their soldiers like slaves whose lives were individually worthless. I still find it shocking that Hitler and some of his associates killed themselves rather than face the consequences when they had wanted their soldiers to fight to the death. And, of course, if Hitler had suicide in mind then of course he's not going to hasten it by surrendering early and saving thousands of his countrymens lives. The book makes you question morality sometimes, especially when the Western Allies (in comparison to the Russians and the Germans who cared little about their own soldiers lives) appear so backward when it comes to going forward and the result is they were slower to finish things off, during which time POW's and civillians are dying.      I found the first hundred pages slow but then I found I couldn't put it down. This is a great, awe inspiring book that teaches and makes you think about things long after you've finished.	2005-08-11

It's told in the first person by different narrators but as I was bored and so unfocused a lot of the time I was sometimes not sure who was narrating. Heathcliffe the 'hero' was annoying and in some ways pathetic and the heroine Cathy seemed like a spoiled brat. I didn't like the use of dialect either- It's a lot easier to read English as it should be written and imagine an accent to it rather than see these strange alien words in print. What an absolute mess of a book, I can't believe all the praise I see heaped on it.	2005-08-07

If you have a good idea why not just write it on a page and publish the one page? If you want to use the good idea to write a book it has to be entertaining or readable or at least interesting. Looking at the other reviews by people who have given it five stars I wonder if I have just read the same book. There are no new paragraphs when he changes the dialogue from one person to the next and the publishers surely should have done this for him because, in not doing so, you keep having to stop to work out who is saying what. The book just crawled along and was so boring. After about sixty pages I remember saying 'alright, I get it, do something else!' Part of me wonders if it's like the emperors new coat and I should just join in with five stars. Although the other reviewers praise the book they don't seem to actually say WHY it's a good book. It was pure mince.	2005-08-07

Things that would be superficial to the story- jobs, shops, transport etc. are deliberately omitted allowing the author to force more focus on character interaction. As with Mill's first two books he hints and suggests at things all the way through. Perhaps as a successful author now and continuing to live in London, Magnus Mills wife has been wanting to move into the country to `get away from it all', I don't know, but there must be a reason for the lecture at the end. Apart from the narrator who is once again nameless, Mills shows the characters that have got away from it all are still very needy of companionship and city life. I'm not convinced by the religious references made by other reviewers.        Once again the prose style of Mills is compelling to the extent where you will wonder why you enjoy it so much. You will see humour and hidden meanings all the way through and, sometimes, it will be easy to see or imagine more than intended, and sometimes you will see less. But sometimes, delightfully, you will wonder what the hell is going on...but you know there's something!	2005-07-24

Without spoiling the plot or surprises it's about a Symbiologist (Robert Langdon) who is in France to meet the curator of The Louvre Art Museum. But the meeting never takes place and there follows in the next few hundred pages an incredible eye-opening journey of discovery. Langdon and a Cryptologist (Sophie Neveau) are on a chase to solve a puzzle left for them by the curator. They don't know who the good guys/ bad guys are, they don't know what's on the other end of the puzzle and there are twists and turns all the way through. It reminds me of The Thirty- Nine Steps by John Buchan where you have an ordinary guy (okay, not ordinary but non-cop/ non-crook) just minding his own business and then suddenly caught up in international intrigue and murder and having to stay ahead of both the good guys and the bad because he doesn't know who's on his side. The beginning, ending, and the ride in between are fantastic. The controversial aspects of the book concern Paganism and Catholicism and I'm sure there are many facts but also fallacies - This is fiction. It's nearly six hundred pages long and I read it in a weekend.	2005-07-24

Once again it is told in a deadpan first person style by a nameless character who seems out of work but can financially afford to expect to travel eastern europe soon. As in Mill's first book our hero doesn't have any friends or family but we're not told if this is down to his nomadic lifestyle or vice-versa. He is pulled into the local community bit by bit due to his subconscious need for company, or the need to belong. Mill's shows that people this needy can be used n' abused to the extent where they can become unwitting servants. The books back cover suggests its about innocence against experience but I'd liken it to weakness against strength or an outsider against an insider. A few laughs again and, as in his first book, some of these will be up to the reader as it's all so subtle. One problem I had with the book though is that you lose the novelty a bit which is natural but I do wonder if Mills can keep this up and continue to be successful. For instance I loved Restraint of Beasts, liked AQon the O/Express very much  and wonder if four or five books down the line I'll just find them okay. Anyway, this book is worth a shot!	2005-07-14

There's black humour all the way through it and from my own experience of being an Englishman doing menial work in Scotland (making wooden pallets for three years) of course it was realistic. The three main characters are treated like beasts themselves by their bosses worthless except for the money they represent(the term beasts is what the Scots use to describe livestock).The work they have to do all day is so boring and laborious that all they've got to look forward to at the end of the day is a few drinks in the pub. Oblivion in any form to take them away from the drudgery of their lives. Two of them keep stopping for smokebreaks at the slightest chance, anything to stop this depressing work. Also I liked the way that there weren't any women in their lives, they seemed totally cut off socially from them by circumstance, bad pay and lack of experience. Fenced in themselves, if you like.I liked the bits in the english pub where they sit and drink and there is almost an invisible fence between them and the proper world outside. Sprinkled through the book are plenty of laughs but this will depend on you, the reader, as it is all so subtle. The author doesn't spell everything out for you and there are hidden meanings and hidden laughs all the way through. I'm so glad that books like this that are so different and creative can still be written and find their way to the shop shelves. I'll be keeping an eye out for more of Magnus Mills.	2005-07-04

You are always thinking of the victims ends, snuffed out in their prime with their whole lives ahead of them. But the book is mainly about the trial of Rose West- did she, didn't she? Without deciding for you either way there is no doubt that the trial was a bit of a farce and that 'innocent till proven guilty' is a phrase used so often by society as word service to the judicial system that for all intents and purposes it has become meaningless. When a police force backed by society hatred and anger is trying to prove you guilty then you HAVE to prove your innocence in order to fight. Proving her innocence Rose West failed to do but so too did the prosecution fail to prove her guilt. If she was guilty because she 'must have known' then so are other members of the house guilty. There were hundreds of missing bones from the several victims which points to the dismemberment of the bodies happening away from the house and this indicates Fred Wests need to keep things secret from Rose. What makes me angry about this book is that Rose West could indeed be guilty but the trial never proved it one way or the other. Also, it shows that with Fred Wests suicide, the police and society, needing an outlet still for the rage, turned on Rose West like they had Derek Bently many years before when the real killer was too young to be legally prosecuted. A disturbing aspect was the tabloid journalists supplying schoolchildren with eggs to pelt Rose Wests police van so they could photograph it as she was driven off to court before being tried. Also one of the daughters getting offered hundreds of pounds by a newspaper for her inside story and then paid thousands when she added a page full of maternal abuse. This is a book that makes you think. My conclusions afterwards are that it seems so difficult to find the truth in these situations that society is not helped by the judicial system behaving maliciously and incompetently, and governmentspandering to the mob by allowing journalistic interference. As I said, the book doesn't show Rose Wests innocence, it only shows that the trial was a farce.	2005-06-28

A family whose father is away are on an idyllic holiday in the Lake District for two weeks and the group of children are allowed to spend all of it camping on an island and sailing. They pretend to be grownups and meet another couple of kids who are pretending to be pirates. Reading this now as an adult was enjoyable enough for me to know I would have loved it when I was a kid. The book made me feel a bit sad in that I don't think this world exists anymore though perhaps it could if kids had the right parents. There's no TV, no personal hi-fi's with their sexual innuendo-filled songs etc. It also shows that kids can, with a little help from the parents, get by for long periods on their own. I don't think parents would allow this nowadays but maybe I'm wrong. A fun read, I'd advise you to get it for your kids then go camping!	2005-06-24

I was expecting that halfway through, he would, and the second half of the book would be about his mission in New York or wherever. But no, this goes on right till the end. Gerald Seymore has written so many great books that for me this was a big disappointment. There are no likeable characters in the book. The walk across the desert for some of the characters seemed to go on forever and I wondered why Seymore was doing this, going on and on and on- does he get paid per word? There were the odd killings thrown in almost as if the author sensed the journey would be tedious. The best parts of the book was the by-play between Bart and Wroughton but there wasn't much of this and far too much boring by-play between the Recruit and his guides in the desert who were portrayed as callous, ignorant fanatics to the extent where you just wanted them all to get shot. If you want a good Seymore get The Journeyman Tailor (my favourite) or The Contract.	2005-06-03

Comedy is one of those itchy things that you either get it, and love it or you don't. I didn't. I found the dialect frustrating: It was supposed to be set in Kent but the dialect read more like northern England, you have to read it slower to work out what is being said and in doing so you lose your attention slightly which takes the edge off the humour to the extent that you're not even aware that humour is present. At least that's what it was like for me. Whatever the nasty thing in the cowshed was isn't explained in the end but you're left feeling that there is a hint of bestiality that didn't really suit the book, being or trying to be a comedy, hence the lack of explanation. I've given it two stars because when Gibbons takes a step back and looks at the overall picture she has a great way of describing scenes.	2005-05-13

Some parts are brilliant, some are okay and some are dull. It's the dull ones that cause me to put the book down for long periods. I like the way Hornby thinks, he just always seems so clued up on modern life and people. I had a major problem with the Songs as I didn't recognise 29 of them. Now, the book is written so you don't NEED to be familiar with them but I know it would have helped my apreciation of the book, as would a greater love for music than I have. The book is mostly about what certain songs have meant to him in his life and the idea is that the reader will also feel a link while reading. Which I did for the most part but...so frustrating not knowing these songs. I can see from other reviewers that you can now get a CD for it which you couldn't when I got the book. I would strongly advise people to get the CD as well. Good luck.	2005-04-16

I was 12 yrs to 17 yrs old and at school we felt a kind of juvinile morbid delight every time there was a new killing. I remember seeing Sutcliffs photo for the first time and thinking how he looked just like the photofits I'd seen on the telly and wasn't it strange that someone who looked so like the photofits wasn't caught for so long. Also I remember the taped voice and really BELIEVING that it was the voice of the Ripper.It was strange how for some people The Yorkshire Ripper cast his shadow over the whole of England not just the Northeast. It was facinating reading this book and seeing all the behind the scenes incompetence from the upper echelons of the West Yorkshire Police. At one stage they tried looking at over fifty thousand vehicles for tyres that matched trackmarks left at murder scenes but the top brass never prioritised the search. The upper brass cancelled the search after thirty thousand cars had been checked- many of them women owners etc. who could have been checked later. A Detective Constable called Laptew handed a report in which virtually fingered Sutcliff but, because he got his bosses back up at the same time, the report was filed and ignored and then \\"lost\\" when there was an enquiry. The incompetence of the upper ranks of the police was beyond belief. For me, this is what made this a great book. I felt very sad reading about these poor desparate women and their deaths and still have a kind of morbid fascination (I think we all do)for the killings but the overiding factor in the book is the police manhunt and their incompetence though the author is very kind to them- he probably made promises to get his research. The police manhunt takes place in a different world than today with no computers etc. so no national pooling of information or experience. You just get the feeling that although the book says that Hoban, Oldfield and Holland are good coppers, they reached their exalted positions through politics rather than brilliance. <br />   I read this book in just a few days.A fascinating read.	2005-04-01

This book didn't do a lot for me because of my own inability to understand Olde English. I don't have the version I read of King lear listed on amazon so I don't know if other versions are dumbed down for the lies of me or if they're all in Olde English. I needed to refer to Amazon reviewers twice to understand what was going on. And although I could write down a pretty accurate summary of the plot I couldn't become emtotional at all while reading it due to having to work out what I was reading. I read this book due to the feeling that I'm missing out on something and I still feel that now. I would advise people like me to find a modernised version if they can and good luck.	2005-03-05

The first half of the book is about the background- Sierra Leone (I keep calling it Sergio Leone!), the history, Freetown (the Capital), the gold and diamond mines, the army, the rebel army, the mercenaries, the Mammy Yoko Hotel etc. The second half of the book really takes off after the coup and the rebels loot, rape and pillage the capital untill they turn their attentions to the Mammy Yoko Hotel and the sheltering inhabitants. Will Scully- ex SAS(pilgrims) is left having to defend them against over a thousand rebel soldiers with limited arms in which to do so. It really is an amazing read and an insight not just into the world of Sierra Leone but of men like Will Scully. My kind of hero- it wasn't his job to do this. Cometh the hour, cometh the man doesn't usually happen- but it did this time and I'd advise everyone to partake in his memories. Fantastic book.	2005-02-19

I'm no quantum theorist however so I should have flipped through these parts more than I did and concentrated on the politics and the war parts which were excellent. The quantum theorem stuff gave me a headache but if you can hang in there I'm sure it'll add to your appreciation of the book. I felt a little impatient all the way through as I wanted to read about Trinity and Hiroshima and the politics behind them. And it was interesting to read about the hopes and fears of the very human but brilliant scientists. I liked the way the book linked the dropping of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki all the way back to before the first world war, the lack of unconditional surrender in 1918 and so the desire for it in 1945, many Jews fleeing from Germany in the thirties including their top scientists, the fear of Hitler getting the bomb first etc. It just all seems inevitable with the gift of hindsight but this book shows the uncertainty and fears of the days and long candlelit nights. I think anyone who is contempuous towards the people involved in the arrival of nuclear weapons should read this book and at least speak from knowledge rather than emotion.	2005-01-15

And that is in the first person from the perspective of a fifteen year old with Asperger's Syndrome which, from what I gather from the book, is a kind of Autism or at least similar. Yes, there is a plot which moves things along but the book is about the prose which details the hero's life and thought processes. It is so different but clear and sharp and absolutely charming. From the word Go I couldn't put it down. I picked it up at six o'clock and finished it at one in the morning. I was reminded a little of the first Adrian Mole diary which when I read it also had a plot but succeeded mainly due to its prose. <br />   Mark Haddon's brilliant book starts with the discovery of a dead dog with a garden fork sticking through it and with him deciding to do a murder investigation. I will say no more of the plot. Sometimes the book is very sad and a few times its laugh- out- loud funny as the hero has his daily struggle with the world and the people in it. I think that this is a modern classic and I like to think that in a hundred years from now it'll still be in the shops.  <br />	2005-01-09

Once reading however, it was compulsive enough to be worth the effort (I'm a slow reader). It holds an extremely clever plot which hooked me and made me admire the author and the book but...never quite managed to make me really believe in the Count as a man; this Godlike being formerly a young sailor, wrongly imprisoned, educated by a fellow-lag into this all-knowing, manipulative and omnipotent (but sentient) creation. I had to will the suspension of disbelief and managed it just enough to enjoy the book. I liked, or rather agreed with, the idealistic themes, the lack of truly good and bad main characters - the four of Dantes targets are all very human. Some of the secondary characters seemed too good to be true though but more depth to them may have resulted in a further few hundred pages!<br /><br />  Taken less seriously, if you just want to enjoy a book, it's a compulsive, fun read with not too many frustratingly long-drawn out parts- though there are some.	2004-12-28

The characters all seemed two dimensional, the plot plodded along to the extent that I found it difficult to focus and concentrate and was always wondering if I was missing something.I kept asking myself why was D Tartt going into this much detail. And I couldn't believe one review I read that suggested that if you don't like the book then you're stupid. No, if you don't like the book it's just because you're too bored reading it to take it all in. I just wish I'd given up after a hundred pages of it instead of wasting so many more hours of my life, but I persisted because I hoped foolishly it would pick-up. I have to say the best thing about the book was the very attractive D Tartts photo inside the back cover. I would advise people to look at that and ignore the print!	2004-12-14

It's about a hundred and thirty pages long with large gaps in between the lines so it took me about three or four hours to read it. Of course I've seen countless actors play Scrooge (George C. Scott my favourite)but really, because there's been so many, none of them dominated my mind while reading. The plot moves along very quickly and little is in the book plotwise which is not in the films. In fact I'm now aware of how much the films 'fleshed out' some of it.Also in the movies you can't get a lot of the Dickens humour which is sprinkled through the prose so it was a great choice for me and will be for you.	2004-12-02

I think that, in a strange way, the book benefits from this as it gives the pages a raw genuine feel. It's a little repetitive, didactic and author Tressel is tough on his characters.It was strange for me reading about similar boss corruptions, abuses of authority, sycophancy a hundred years ago. Though in those days the target was more work for food, now the target is more is that newer car or perhaps that bigger house.It stinks now as it did then but I was so glad to read a book with it all laid out. John Steinbeck also has touched upon it in the Grapes of Wrath  less brutally but more beautifully. I would like to force everyone to read this book - especially the Misery's. A friend recently told me that the book was initially entitled The Ragged Ars** Philanthropists.Any way it was very good. N.B. I tried to change my rating to four stars but the Amazon site wouldn't let me!	2004-11-27

I wouldn't   normally get a book like it but my friend and I are taking   turns to pick a book out of the BBC's top One Hundred and   this month it's Athur Goldens.   This intricate, beautiful novel kept me totally spellbound   throughout its 420 closely printed pages. I'm SO happy to   have chosen it and read it. It's a little tough emotionally   in the way The Grapes Of Wrath is or perhaps Clan of the   Cave Bear but there are many feel-good moments in amongst   the feel-bad moments. And you can't but help to appreciate   the beauty of some of the characters despite their customs   sometimes seeming so alien. The cleverness of the plot   pulls you along also and now that I've finished it I know I   will be hunting on the net, hungry for more info on Geishas.     I'm amazed I hadn't even heard of this book until   recently.	2004-11-26

No way is it up to Steinbecks standard.

Though it's large print and very short lines across so you read it in a 4/5 hours. It's really a short story or a 'novella'. It reminds me a little of Of Mice and Men in that it's seemingly short and simple but it catches you. I have to say though, some of the praise seems a bit over the top: Life-changing? What the hell are those guys ON?  Whatever it is, I want some! The only thing that spoiled it for me was the Alchemists 'wisdom' dominating late on instead of a story. Loved the ending. Ideal book for a flight or train journey.	2004-09-08

Normally when I have a book that is so different it can be boring and doesn't hook me but not this. It's about a very strange character who at first is curiously innocent, nave and almost alien-like. There is a lot of black humour in the book, and this helps to carry the reader through the nasal alchemy, murder etc. I was amazed at how well this translated to English; I think it reads better than a lot of originally English novels. The prose is concise and to the point. Its 260 pages long and I think a lot of other authors would have doubled that. I will be recommending this brilliant, brilliant book to all of my bookreading friends and to all of you.	2004-08-30

It concerned Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty hitch-hiking and driving back and forth across America with no apparent purpose. I didn't care (and still don't) about the beat generation stuff, didn't care about Sal or Dean, and just found the whole thing a tedious literary journey. JK said this was \\"Kickwriting\\" but unfortunately for me it wasn't kickreading matter. If you like the first twenty pages you'll love the book because it's the same ALL the way through. In amongst its 270 pages I got the occasional smile or the rare warm feeling for the characters but mostly it was a drag. Its books like this that make me realise why so many authors try to break up what they're writing if they can. Everyone liked the trench warfare stuff in Birdsong, for instance, but Sebastian Faulkes moved away from it a few times to break it up I assume because he was worried it would be tedious. So, I've read another American classic. Not in the same league as the Grapes of Wrath. Maybe it was gimmicky or even revolutionary when it first came out but I was reading it NOW and it has to stand on it's own two feet fifty years on. But it couldn't.	2004-08-27

An extremely sad journey through it's pages, you just want the journey to end and the book to be over. This book is beatifully written as I knew it would be. The opening chapter is awesomely written and the tragic Joad family are of course wonderful. Despite the critical introduction I never felt preached to and never felt that dialogue from the Joad family was over and above what you'll get from semi-literate, poverty stricken folk.I don't understand why the publishers allowed such a snobby guy to give the introduction which, before I knew it, told me the ending. How stupid can you get? I'd advise you to read the book BEFORE the intro and make your own mind up BEFORE the intro. This book is one of the reasons I love books. It opened up a little world in my mind that I never knew existed in 1930's America. And I keep talking about it to people and comparing it to the world today. Hope you get it.The book is about farm labourers, small-time plot holders who's livelihoods have been taken away by the coming of the tractors and 1930's Depression. These people have been born and brought up to live off the land, ploughing, sewing etc and NOTHING ELSE. So,skill-less,homeless, hungry, desperate and financially broke they migrate West under promises of work in the West and streets lined with Orange trees. Unfortunately, there's half a million people migrating and not nearly enough work. When the family leave Oaklahoma, Buisnessmen use their desperation to bargain down the worth of their lifes belongings and, when they travel they are told early that buisnessmen use the huge numbers of people, and their hunger and desperation, to lower wages. This book made me hate certain aspects of human nature-competition, survival of the fittest, progress etc. But you will love and admire the Joad family.<br />  In all, an intense beautifully written story that had me hungry for every word.	2004-08-14

I can see why some people would think this.<BR>   After just finishing The Chamber my first thoughts are that it was compulsive read but also that the ending left me feeling a little flat. It was fast paced, and at times moving (re the lynching photo and Halls thoughts about it). You're left feeling how awful it is to spend years on death row but...the alternatives are never gone into in depth-there is only so much one can do with this I suppose, especially if the authors trying to entertain as well as enlighten. It reminded me of Dead Man Walking where it took the murderers pending death, moments away, for him to be truly repentant. Like that movie The Chamber inspires sympathy and forgiveness for the main characters and shows that people can change. I got a little disinterested in all the legal procedures and ended up trying to flip through these paragraphs to concentrate on the plot and emotion. There were some loose ends but you can't often squeeze life into a perfect little package.<BR>   I was very happy with the lack of romantic interest to slow the pace down (Grisham uses an alcoholic Aunt for this) at key moments. And happy that I didn't feel preached to by the author. Even now I'm not sure how strongly, if at all, Grisham is anti execution. He certainly didn't hold back on Cayhalls crimes.<BR>   All in all a very good book. Very different to my normal fare and one I would strongly recommend.	2004-07-08

I'm reading this book because it(His Dark Matierials) ranked SO highly in The Big Read (number 5).I read it over a couple of days so it's easy to read,compulsive, and good fun.The prose,every paragraph is concise and not as disordered and messy as J.K.Rowlings. NOT as great as the media suggest(so far!).Also I'm forty and this is obviously a childrens book which is why I've maybe been a little generous with the mark.Am I alone also, in thinking Harry Potter would be no match for Lyra?I found it better than the Harry Potter books and, I think ,would have loved it when I was younger.I'm also hoping that it(the whole trilogy) will merit a 5/5 when I've finished.The concept of Daemons/severed children is clever and,emotionally,gives you something to 'hang on to'.I've found with some adult fantasy books that I've read recently that the respective authors really struggle to get you to care that much for characters outside the 'main cast' spectrum.I.E.Although HP's parents are dead,I've read too many of that type of cliche d device for it to really pull me in,though this could be due to age and too much experience again.Reading this,my first childrens book for a year,was very enjoyable but,as I said earlier,I hope for better in the next two volumes.	2004-05-14

The Great Idea that spawned this book is visionary and intelligent and hampered by Aldous Huxleys' anti-American ideals.I found that the first few chapters of the book consisted of the author trying(successfully though boringly)to persuade us of the world he was creating and at the same time trying (and failing dismally) to include storyline and character developement.The author was evidently an intelligent man with great ideas but I,personally, want more than that from my reads.Huxley was influenced by Anti-American friends and two 'trips'(not holidays) to America to confirm his suspicians about the 'New Power' taking the rest of us down the slippery slope of classless mass production.I say that AH was an intellectual,creatively barren,snob who cared more about maintaining his sheltered middle-class England and not about the lower classes.He also tried and failed to make it in Hollywood,the critics now say that he was 'too intelligent' for hollywood but,after reading BNW,I suspect he just wasn't creative enough-for all his great ideas and I suspect the resentment from being judged wanting by such a faction is a main reason for his political bent.	2004-03-11
