Someone, please, reprint this little gem! <br />I found it in the library when my 2-year-old son wanted to take out \\"Petunia\\" (another classic by the same author) again. <br />When I think of all the borrrrring!!! books of colors there are in print, this one makes me want to sing for joy. <br />The colors each speak, describing themselves and the things they represent in poetic and novel terms. <br />After each color description, a kitten in the corner of every picture changes colors. <br />Finally the colors decide that instead of praising themselves, they ought ot celebrate the way they can live together in harmony. A full-color landscape and the real colors of the kitten (who's a 3-color calico) appear. <br />Great for tots & nice for parents, too.	2005-09-12

It is considerably less violent than classic children's tales like the Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood. The characters are only AFRAID that someone is out to get them. That's the whole point of the story.  <br /> <br />Only the child narrator is fearless enough to confront each animal in turn and get to the root of all the fear, which is a misunderstanding. This message is put across in catchy rhymes that repeat in longer and longer sequences of who runs from whom, in the \\"house that Jack built\\" sort of pattern that small children especially enjoy. My one-and-a-half-year-old son and I have had a lot of fun with this book. <br /> <br />	2005-04-08

As another reader mentioned, it doesn't really explain Christmas, but then again, it's anyone's guess how much of an explanation a one-year-old understands anyway. In every other way, the book is excellent: the simple poetry (based partly on the old carol \\"The Friendly Beasts\\") sounds touching and beautiful when read aloud; the illustrations are warm and appealing; even the layout of the book, with large letters on one page and a single bold image on the facing page, is elegantly designed and well-adapted to young children. I love to look at the illustrations: Mary looks joyful and loving, the animals look friendly but not too \\"cutesy,\\" and (rarest of all) Baby Jesus actually looks like a scrawny newborn, not a chubby one-year-old, as most people draw the Nativity scene. I recommend this as your child's first Christmas book.	2004-12-20

Tomie dePaola's gorgeous illustrations to this simple story have a sort of pre-Raphaelite glow to them, and the animals' faces seem almost soulful. I also appreciated the music in the back that enabled me to sing the words rather than simply telling them. Reading the book to a one-year-old, I would prefer that more of the pictures actually show the baby Jesus rather than implying his presence, which is a little hard to explain to a very young child. But all in all, it's a lovely Christmas book for children and lovers of Christmas carols alike.	2004-12-20

Jamma jamma jamma jamma P!J!\\" seldom fails to get a baby grin. The pictures of happy dancing animals, like most of Boynton's illustrations, just radiate good feeling.

The &quot;sample registry&quot; in the appendix kept me from simply being paralyzed in the baby product store, not knowing where to start.

My husband and I, expecting our first child, had so little experience with babies that we found most books of \\"baby basics\\" weren't basic enough for us. We wanted BABIES FOR DUMMIES. If that's what you need, too, then this book is for you. It recognizes that in today's world, not all parents -- not even all mothers -- have ever babysat for an infant, changed a diaper, or even picked up and put down a newborn baby.<br />The book is basic -- REAL BASIC -- and that's its strength and its weakness. It features concise, step-by-step instructions with photos that clearly illustrate techniques like picking up a newborn, washing him/her with cotton balls, and giving the first bath in a baby tub. It's great for the simple stuff, but for more complex topics that need more discussion than a bullet-point list and some photos, you will want another book. Because everything is discussed in the same bullet-point lists, more complicated topics such as introducing babies to pets and siblings (why would you want this primer if you already had a kid?), and worse, resuming your sex life after childbirth, are reduced to such simplistic directions that they might as well not have been attempted, because there's no room for \\"how\\" or \\"why.\\" For example, the book tells you to evict pets from your bed before the child's birth. But why should you do that if you plan to put the baby in his/her own crib? Also, some things that the book states as absolute truths (e.g., it's safe for the child to sleep in your bed as long as you don't take alcohol, drugs, or medicine; pets should never be allowed in the baby's room) actually contradict what I have seen in other recent sources, and should have been more honestly presented as one opinion among many.<br />Despite its limitations, I am glad I bought this book because of the clear illustrations of simple techniques, and the user-friendly spiral-bound format.	2003-07-11

If you already know that's what you want, this book may seem a bracing pep talk on how to talk back to the medical establishment. However, if you're either unsure how you feel or, worse, if you actually think you'd like some medicinal pain relief during what's widely agreed to be the most painful experience in most women's lives, this book is not for you. I'm not sure how they selected the women they surveyed on birth preferences, but considering that they quoted only about 1 woman who actually wanted drugs rather than having them forced upon her by evil doctors, I have my doubts about their selection methods. In my own experience, I have yet to come upon a woman who got the sort of athletic satisfaction out of the unmitigated pain of labor that seems so common among their interviewees. Most of the women I know seem to think pain hurts, and it'd be nice to have less of it.<br />The authors claim that interventions by doctors (all sorts of pain medications, inducing labor, episiotomy, and especially caesarean sections) only make childbirth more dangerous for both mother and baby. This seems highly dubious to me, because far more women and babies died during childbirth before these techniques were invented. They back up all their conclusions by citing scientific studies, but neither of them is a scientist, a doctor, a nurse, a public health specialist, an epidemiologist, or a midwife, so I doubt they really have the qualification to do the kind of scientific analysis of birth technologies that they claim to be doing, and I strongly suspect them of cherry-picking studies that support their ideological convictions and ignoring evidence to the contrary.<br />In addition, a book written in 1992 about childbirth choices is likely to be completely outdated for women giving birth in the age of Damaged Care, I mean Managed Care. To give you a hint of the problem, while the authors mention HMOs, they feel the need to define the term. The health care world has changed, and many of the options they describe may not be options any more.	2003-06-13

Captain Cordelia Naismith is a strong female hero, and the second part of this two-novel repackaging is particularly noteworthy in giving us a science fiction adventure with a pregnant hero. I first read this book when I didn't realize I was pregnant, and it was the perfect way to start into that great 9-month adventure.<br />The first novel in the volume, Shards of Honor, is a space-adventure-romance which might be described as military science fiction as it might have been written by Jane Austen: two mature, intelligent, and principled characters overcoming differences (rooted in complex social situations) to find a way to be together without compromising their sense of honor.<br />In the second novel, Barrayar, the pregnant Cordelia must use all her courage and ingenuity to bring her baby, the future Lord Miles Vorkosigan, through a planetary civil war alive. She concludes that the only thing to do is to change the world to make it fit for her child -- and all children. I recommend this book (and Cordelia's conclusion) to fans of romantic science fiction &amp; female action heroes. Especially if they happen to be pregnant!	2003-05-31

TO SAY NOTHING OF THE DOG is a great homage to Wodehouse's light, fluffy romantic comedies about bewildered British upper-class twits in love. (References to Jeeves are dropped in to let you know the resemblance isn't accidental.) Two time-travelers from the future (on a properly Wodehousian absurd mission) accidentally interrupt the wooing of some exceedingly silly Victorian couples, with unexpected impact on the space-time continuum. As they struggle to set right what they have disturbed, there may be just the faintest hint of a more serious thread about Providence -- but not nearly enough to weigh down the gossamer-light comedy. A fun book.	2003-04-11

David Lodge's story of a group of British Roman Catholics passing through Vatican II is by turns funny, touching, and sad. But it's the humor that lingers -- not the surface-level \\"don't nuns look funny?\\" stuff that usually passes for Catholic jokes, but smart, pointed humor that comes from an intimate knowledge of the joy, pain, absurdity, and glory of wrestling with a two-thousand-year-old religion and struggling to reconcile it with everyday life in a changing world. Example: a bright medical student kneeling at Communion, trying not to be preoccupied with the theological implications of the Body of Christ passing through the whole digestive process. But none of the shots are cheap: the attitude toward faith is respectful without knee-jerk acceptance or rejection of orthodox pieties. A brilliant, sensitive, funny, tragic, hopeful, doubting, unforgettable book.	2002-10-21

He becomes tutor to a young, spirited, intelligent, and cursed princess, and little by little his duty to protect and educate her turns into a desperate struggle to free her from the curse she has inherited -- a struggle in which the five gods of Chalion are both his greatest allies and the source of his greatest anguish and fear. Ultimately, this is the story of the painful effort to make room for divine action in the human world. The gods can only act through a willing human being, and those who offer their will to the gods take upon themselves a world of suffering.<br />I would offer this story as a rebuttal to any who say fantasy is only escapism. The Curse of Chalion shows what fantasy can do in the right hands: it can explore the deepest truths of the human heart. I recommend it to anyone looking for fantasy worth taking seriously.	2002-04-04

Tolkien: Author of the Century	Books	5	4	6	N	N	A spirited defense of a popular author &amp; his readers	Shippey's argument that Tolkien was the foremost author of the 20th century has surely raised hackles among professors of literature: after all, fantasy is even more reviled than science fiction among high culture's arbiters of taste. Shippey martials an impressive body of evidence to support his claim that Tolkien deserves to be considered a great author on the grounds of influence, literary quality, and relevance to the burning social issues of his day; he also demonstrates that Tolkien's works are, for stories set in an imaginary past, almost perversely cutting-edge in their social, artistic, and intellectual concerns. Along the way, he also directs some (IMO) satisfyingly sarcastic remarks at the snobbery of a literary-critical establishment that ignores the literature read by the vast majority of readers. I enjoyed these as much as I enjoyed Shippey's perceptive analysis of Tolkien's works, which increased my appreciation for the ingenuity and artistry of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. All in all, the book left me looking forward to rereading Tolkien's works with greater relish than ever. <br />I am not sure whether someone who has not suffered through a doctoral program in English would get the same kick out of this book that I did. However, by the standards of lit crit, it is wondrously readable; and fans of Tolkien should enjoy a book that defends not only the author we love, but ourselves as readers, as well.	2002-01-29

He finds himself in the middle of a life-and-death struggle for the Paper Grail, an origami cup with mystical powers over land and water. Blaylock slips adeptly from the everyday to the sublime, pitting unlikely heroes -- failed small businessmen and eccentrics -- against some pretty likely villains of our time: greedy real estate tycoons and cynics who would use the Grail's powers for their own aggrandizement rather than the good of the land. You're more likely to enjoy this beautifully written, highly literate book if you have read a good deal of Arthurian literature and if you're familiar with the Pre-Raphaelite artists of the late Victorian period. Fans of Tim Powers' _Last Call_ should definitely read _Paper Grail_: to judge by the dedications, the two authors were probably trading ideas the whole time they were writing.	2001-10-21

In a small town where our reality and another, magical world meet, teenagers from our world and the otherworld struggle to find the balance between family ties and their growing sense of their own identity.

That's what I think a fantasy should do, and that's why Blaylock is one of my favorite authors.	2001-01-05

The truth is more complex-- and much more sinister.<br />James Blaylock's novels are hard to describe -- funny/serious, beautifully written, highly literate, quirky, surrealistic romps through a world of mystery lying just beneath the surface of prosaic suburban American life. The typical Blaylock story takes the kind of nice guy who proverbially finishes last and throws him in the midst of a cosmic battle between good &amp; evil which is fought in banal, recognizable surroundings: strip malls, suburban lawns, donut shops. The effect is sort of G.K. Chesterton on acid: fables of high moral purpose with a much less rigid notion of morality than Chesterton's and a weirder sense of humor. Well-read readers with a taste for oddities should try them.	2000-12-29

At 36, I'm re-reading them, and they definitely stand the test of time.<br />Though set in an imaginary medieval kingdom, the Prydain chronicles remind me of Star Wars -- or, to be more exact, Star Wars reminds me of the Prydain Chronicles, which I read before Luke ever heard of the Force. A naive, headstrong boy of unknown parentage dreams of glory while spending his days in dull farm chores -- until he unexpectedly finds himself in the midst of a cosmic battle between good and evil. He journeys away from his home and discovers beauties and terrors he never dreamed of. Although the adventuring life isn't at all what he expected, and his mistakes are many, he eventually discovers his own inner strength in ways he never imagined.<br />These wise and witty books are gorgeously written. Adults with an ear for poetic language may recognize this; children may appreciate it without being able to identify exactly what makes this book more than just another sword and sorcery adventure.<br />Although the Book of Three is probably the weakest of the series, it is the introduction to the marvelous world of Prydain, so it's worth finishing to be ready for the full flavor of the other four. However, you can still pick up the series in the middle: I started with the last book &amp; still got hooked!	2000-12-29

Like Babylon 5, this science fiction epic will please people who enjoy speculating about political problems and seeing broad social conflicts played out with a varied cast of complex characters.<br />The conflicts that drove Red Mars -- between those bent on terraforming Mars and those committed to keeping it pristine; between Martian settlers and those engaged in mining Mars for Earth's profit; and between different visions for the future of Mars society -- continue in Green Mars, but new complexities intervene. Children brought up on Mars, many of them in experimental communities organized around utopian ideals, don't share the views of the first settlers. And the first settlers, too, have changed, sobered by the failure of their first war of independence. Will the ever more fragmented people of Mars be able to agree on anything -- much less unite to win independence?<br />I found Green Mars a satisfying, intelligent book which even nullifies my trifling criticisms of Red Mars: plot threads which seemed to have been dropped in Red Mars resurface here, not forgotten after all, and Robinson's seeming prejudice against Christians in Red Mars seems to be deliberately corrected in Green Mars. However, it's not for everyone: kids who can read Asimov and Heinlein easily may find Robinson's vocabulary too difficult. Adults wanting a very light read may find it heavy going, as well: this thoughtful book demands readers' full attention. R-rated sex scenes may bother some fastidious readers. And, as with all political stories, appreciation of Green Mars may depend on your politics. Here, again, Babylon 5 provides a good rule of thumb: I would guess that anyone who wasn't put off by the show's political content shouldn't be afraid of this book, either. Give it a try!	2000-11-20

Neither they nor the patchwork consortium of world powers who sent them could agree why they were there or what they wanted from Mars. To Phyllis, Mars was a geological treasure-trove for commercial usage. To Ann, Mars was a museum of geology to be preserved as much as possible in its natural state. To Sax, it was a laboratory for bioengineering experimentation; to Arkady, a laboratory for social reform. To Nadia, it was the supreme test of her genius for cold-weather engineering. To John Boone, the group's charismatic figurehead, it was the sum of what everyone else wanted it to be: he just wanted the First 100 to stand united. No one knew what Frank Chalmers wanted -- but whatever it was, John Boone stood in his way.<br />Most fans of Red Mars rave about its scientific realism, but I've never cared one way or another about the technicalities of speculating plausible future technologies. Instead, I recommend this book for its broad epic vision, its believably complex political situation, and its portrayal of strong but flawed characters confronting difficult situations with ingenuity, hope, and courage. I particularly like the way Robinson explores the complex relationship between John Boone, the First Man on Mars, and his fame -- between a human being &amp; the legend that arose in his wake. The book isn't perfect -- some things the author seemed to be setting up don't pay off, and I could have done without having the most obnoxious character incessantly identified as a &quot;Christian&quot; -- but it's an absorbing, memorable adventure.	2000-10-19

(Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries)	Books	3	138	142	N	N	Dorothy Sayers' apprentice-work	If &quot;Whose Body?&quot; is the only Lord Peter Wimsey novel you've  read, don't judge the rest by it. And if, like me, you read the later ones  first, you may be amused to see how different this one is. I wonder whether  Dorothy L. Sayers was still unsure, when she wrote this, whether she wanted  to write a detective story or a parody of a detective story. There are  wonderful comic touches, oddly mixed with some fairly gruesome scenes. The  characters are broadly satirical, like the caricatured upper-class twits in  P.G. Wodehouse. Lord Peter is frivolous and eccentric, a sort of smarter  cousin to Wodehouse's amiable fop Bertie Wooster; the Dowager Duchess, his  mother, is endearingly ditsy, like Aunt Dahlia of Wodehouse fame. As a  mystery, the story fails -- I knew who the murderer was at once, not  because of any clues but because there wasn't any other reason to introduce  that character. However, it's interesting to examine the early, rough work  that preceded Dorothy L. Sayers later, more polished mysteries. In this  book, she was just beginning to learn her craft. Aspiring writers can  probably learn a lot by comparing this with the much more successful  &quot;Clouds of Witness,&quot; written 4 years later.	2000-09-13

Jack Aubrey of the British navy sets out on a delicate mission calling for cunning, finesse, and political acumen -- not generally his  strong points, at least on dry land. With the advice of his friend, surgeon  and sectret agent Stephen Maturin, Aubrey must choose which of three rival  regimes to support in their conflict over a disputed territory. If he  chooses amiss -- as some in the admiralty seem to hope he will do -- he  faces disgrace and quite possibly bankruptcy. Can he navigate the  treacherous waters of politics in the Ottoman Empire? I wouldn't dream of  giving it away!<br />Along with the dry humor and vivid historical texture  Patrick O'Brien can be counted on to provide, this book brings out depths  in Aubrey's character that hadn't been apparent in earlier books. I rate  this one of the best of a very good series. (They're best read in order;  start with Master &amp; Commander, if you haven't started yet.)	2000-08-17
US	50694079	R1QPSIF4ALLPQ	0446513970	587455513	The Summer Queen	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A fascinating, complex story	Although Summer Queen lacks the mythic structure which lent such power to  Vinge's Snow Queen, it is an expertly written &quot;social science  fiction&quot; exploration of colonialism, as well as an appealing story  about characters worth caring about. <br />The characters who were young and  simple in Snow Queen have grown up, and grown more complex in their view of  the world. Vinge also develops the political situation on Tiamaat in more  complexity. The world she develops is believable. Her best characters  struggle heroically to do the right thing, but are often hampered by the  need to compromise with more powerful military, cultural, or economic  forces--just like real revolutionaries, visionaries, and leaders. I'm  impressed by the depth of political consciousness Vinge brings to this  story.	2000-08-11

This book is not one of her best, but still holds enough of her quirky mysticism to capture a fan's attention. The basic plot will be familiar to McKillip fans: Rook Caladrius  puzzles over the secret of his true identity while making astonishing  music-- much like Morgon in her masterpiece &quot;The Riddlemaster of  Hed,&quot; with some echoes from her one space opera, &quot;Fool's  Run.&quot;  Unfortunately, the reader knows the solution to Rook's identity  crisis before he even starts looking, so the quest lacks suspense. However,  when a troop of musicians must write and perform an opera for a king they  hate, McKillip gets a lot of fun out of playing with the twisted  relationships between art and life, truth and fiction. For that alone, the  book was worth reading.	2000-07-13

As in many of her other books, McKillip deals with mysterious characters who live on the edge between reality and dream.  However, here she errs by making the character who should be mysterious her  narrator. This makes all Roisin's eccentric behavior (slipping off into the  forest to commune with the brook, that sort of thing) seem like a pose. A  real child of nature, living by instinct, wouldn't be writing this book; a  narrator, by definition, has to be self-conscious, and Roisin shouldn't be.  It's too bad, because this could have been a good one if told from a  different point of view.	2000-07-13

This replay of the old &quot;Mars needs women&quot; cliche gives us an earth woman who is kidnapped by aliens as a sex slave, then finds true love with her enslaver.  I thought that kind of masochistic nonsense was a thing of the past.	2000-07-11

Celtic folklore enthusiasts should particularly relish touches like the  Great Shout.	2000-03-24
