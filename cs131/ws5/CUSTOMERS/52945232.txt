US	52945232	R1YKDA1JX8Y7YC	0345461622	197047472	Pandora's Star	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Really Good	I have never read for Peter F. Hamilton before, but the premise for Pandora's Star was intriguing enough to make me get this book. I was very surprised by how engrossing it was. My only criticism was that a bout 50 pages of unnecessary detail could have been edited out. <br />Cannot wait for book 2.	2004-10-11

One must first read &quot;The Risen Empire&quot; which is a 5 star book in and of itself. In the Killing of Worlds, Mr. Westerfeld carries the fast paced action further while showing greater depths and developments for his charecters. There are some unexpected twists and turns as the plot unfolds. Ample room is left perhaps for a third book. Afterall, Lauren is in space with two hostile ships near by and he may have become the nucleus of potential civil war!!  Excellent and efficient story telling. Well done.	2004-01-04
US	52945232	R1TNIF0IC9QC0H	0765305550	350643665	The Risen Empire (Succession)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Outstanding beginning	Risen Empire takes place in a well imagined distant future with fast paced action, an economy of words and well develped charecters. Most of the negative reviews were because the book was not advertised as a first in a trilogy, but I can easily forgive the fact given the quality of the story telling. Hope book 2 lives up to my expectations.	2003-11-30
US	52945232	RFQ6VTJMF4QJE	0312848706	887642373	The Golden Age	Books	5	4	7	N	N	Fantastic future	I picked this book from the public library. It was the first book I read for Mr. Wright and I am extremely glad to admit this wonderful author into my reading life.<br />Mr. Wright's style and prose are highly engaging and who needs aliens when you can hardly recogize humanity itself in that far flung future.  Humans are able download their memories and experiences to be stored until they have need of activating a new body/clone/ or remote telecast.  Machines are sentient and are playing a role in the long term future or humanity (cannot tell as yet whether it is for or against). The legalities  and ethics that accompany such a complex existence are quite interesting.  <br />Yet the protagonist \\"Phaethon\\" remains highly human despite his origins. His driving passion, covictions and drive are infectious. Aslo relationships are well developed and enjoy satisfying complexity and depth. I can hardly wait to get my amazon shipment containing the \\"Phoenix Exultant\\" to find out what happened to him.	2003-08-27
US	52945232	R1QNZBTWJAGJBJ	189206586X	475011999	The Tomorrow Log	Books	2	5	8	N	N	Not up to Standard	This book was well below the expectations I had formed based on reading the Liaden Universe series.  The action and events seemed contrived and poorly woven.  Charecters were not well developed or engaging.  There were whole paragraphs that just seemed to be repeated more than once. I would not care to read the future books in this series.	2003-03-16
US	52945232	R3354GZ4MS6NDT	0743421922	549137614	Look to Windward	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Fantastic	Insightful clear thought wrapped in a fantastic and surprisingly humorous package. It took me a little while to figure out why Mr. Banks dedicated the book to the Gulf War veterans.  Without spoiling the book, think of the \\"Culture\\" as USA plus UK and Chel as the middle east, Afganistan, Vietnam...etc. <br />In the end, I think the Gulf Veterans he dedicated the book to are all the people who lived and survived the war regardless of whether they were Americans, British, Iraqis or Kuwaitis.<br />Considering the fact that the book was published in 2000 and the subsequent tragedy of September 11th, the book is almost prophetic.  I believe it is critical that more people read this book. And the sooner the better.	2003-01-24

He finds that mindkind has evolved into MacroMan leaving behind the ways of \\"microman\\". In this future, there is telepathy, telekinesis and precognition. People are aware of their prior lives and can commit suicide and move on to their next reincarnation when they feel that they have learned all they can from the current one. Jon has only 3 months to attain level 3 macroawareness in order to permanently stay in 2150 A.D. The ideals presented here were mostly pleasant, but quite disconnected from reality. I had strong moral objections to making suicide sound like such a positive thing. Also, I was irritated with the recurring emaphasis on physical beauty as a measure of evolution and inner refinement.	2001-06-23

I was intrigued and reading on in hopes of high &quot;original&quot; adventure. Alas, the author quickly ran out of his promising creativeness and the book turned into an amalgam of other sci-fi books. It felt like reading Ringworld meshed in with some others. My interest was lost and I skimmed through the latter two thirds of the book without losing much.	2001-05-23

US	52945232	R1FMZTP7VEHB0R	0451457854	265583115	Broken Time	Books	1	2	8	N	N	This new author MISSED	Maggy Thomas started out with a good couple of chapters. We are introduced to Siggy who works Monster Row in the institue for the criminally insane. The reader is intorduced to some of Siggy's co-workers and their unusual work situation. Very quickly afterwards, the story breaks down. It becomes intensely flat and uninteresting. The plot undergoes convolutions that felt more like an irritating dream due to indigestion. There is hardly any charecter building and no sooner is one charecter introduced, than it is replaced by another, equally unimaginative, charecter. <br />There were too many references to twentieth century culture that felt out of place: changing flat tires, the music from &quot;Psycho&quot;, Ballroom dancing!!! I almost abandoned the book 2/3 of the way in. Overall, poor style of writing, story telling and plain boring.	2001-01-31

First the events were too fantastic, too far fetched even for science fiction and too hard to swallow,..etc. Again and again through out the book, Arthur demonstrates that he has this British Empire superiority complex. He assumes that measures of human progress include such things as everyone on earth speaking English, that ALL religions are the same and that London is the jewel of Europe and therfore, the world. On the whole, I found the book irritating despite a clearly sophisticated writing style.	2000-09-22
