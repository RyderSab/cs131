She was a precocious child. Her first poem was published when she was nine, and her first novel, 'Beatrice, a Tale of the Early Christians' was written when she 13 and published in her 17th year. At 21 years of age she married Algernon Kingsford who was studying for the Anglican priesthood. She had an independent mind and her own income from her deceased father. She married Algernon on the condition that she be free to follow her own career, an agreement he, to his credit, adhered to. Her only child, Eadith, was born in 1868.When Algernon became a clergyman they settled in Shropshire.In 1872 Anna, as she called herself, owned the 'Lady's Own Paper' in London. This was a forum for her progressive views, and allowed her to meet many women in the women's movement.Florence Fenwick Miller became a close friend.Anna decided to become a doctor, and as women were not allowed to qualify in England, she commenced her studies in Paris. She also managed to do some of her study in London.She met the writer Edward Maitland, and sometimes he accompanied her to Paris.At this time she received mystical illuminations, and Maitland collaborated with her in writing them down.She was a strong opponent of vivisection, and refused to cut up animals during her course.Her thesis was on vegetarianism (it is in print) and she graduated as a doctor in 1880. In 1882 her book 'The Perfect Way or the Finding of Christ' was published. This gained her attention in Theosophical and mystical circles, and she was invited to be president of the British Theosophical Society. She held this post until early 1884 when she stepped down.She did not believe in the Eastern masters of Theosophy, nor of the direction taken of the Society under the influence of Alfred P. Sinnett. She and Maitland formed the Hermetic Society, which studied the Western Mystery Tradition. A member was Samuel MacGregor Mathers, who went on to form the legendary Heremtic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1888.Anna led an extremely busy life, being a doctor and lecturing on vegetarianism and against vivisection. She knew a number of well connected women, such as the mystics Lady Caithness and Lady Mount Temple, and Lady Burton, wife of the explorer Sir Richard Burton.She most probably wore herself out. She was a vehement opponent of Pastuer's cruel experiments with animals.In November 1886 she was drenched in a storm in Paris while attempting a visit to Pasteur's laboratory.This activated her predisposition to consumption (TB). She travelled to Italy and France in a vain attempt to recover her health. She died in London in February 1888.Altogether she wrote ten books, many articles and pamphlets, some writings being published after her death.This biography by Maitland leaves much to be desired. It contains many errors, and omits much pertinent information. In fact, Anna's friend Florence Miller said it was the worst biography she had ever read. The world is waiting for a good biography.	2005-01-14

Her focus is on the use of sexual energy for spiritual growth.She explains how sex energy can be transformed into spiritual energy.She is not against sex, but shows how it can be used in a positive manner.She is not in favour of promiscuous sex because it has no love. She says people need love, but often they mistake sex for love, or think they can get love through sex.Sex is not a problemin itself, but it becomes a problem when there is no love.This message is very needful today.Haich is against sex renunciation because sex energy is our life force.To renounce it is to renounce our life.She points out that only a few can follow the higher path and transform their sex energy into spiritual energy.In such a case sex energy is not lost, but brings the person closer to God.Haich explains that the dragon in alchemy represents the sex energy.Depictions of fiery dragons in alchemy show the sex energy being transformed into spiritual energy.Sex is not lost, but used for a great purpose.The alchemist him or herself becomes an hermetically sealed vessel, not wasting the precious sex energy, but transforming it into higher energy.This book is not for all, but those who are ready for it can gain deep insights.	2003-10-01

When she met them,Janet tells us what clothes these people wore, and in some cases, how they dished up a meal. There is no reliable information given about either poet.Janet tells us that interesting biography can't be objective. But really, she can't be objective because she is unashamedly in the pro Ted Hughes camp. If Janet wished to learn something about Sylvia and Ted she could have asked an astrologer. Then she would have found out that Sylvia was a Scorpio, and in Chinese astrology she was a monkey.A Scorpio monkey is a strange character. She can be obsessive, extremely secretive and perversely wilful. Janet would have be informwd that Sylvia's Sun was square with Saturn. This indicates a strict superego controlling the instincts.This inner conflict would boil over at times into destructive behavior. Ted,a Leo, had eight squares in his chart, showing much inner conflict. His Venus was afflicted, indicating self-indulgence, an unloving nature, and erratic behavior in love matters.There is in-built tension between a Scorpio and a Leo. Unless both parties compromise, their strong wills clash and turn the relationship into a battlefield. Ted's Mars is square to Sylvia's Venus, causing a hostile attitude towards her.His Mars is in her fourth house of the home, so his hostility would appear there.An astrologer could have told Janet this, and more on what made these two poets tick.If you like gossip about famous people, you'll find it in this book	2003-07-16

He saw how the state and power elites were using technology to control people's lives. This has created a new form of totalitarianism. People are massively controlled and manipulated by technology.Our freedom today is to simply to walk about in our cages and choose the wallpaper. Marcuse points out that inner freedom or private space has been invaded and whittled down by technology reality. The media is especially at fault, and things are much worse than when he wrote in 1964. False needs are so pervasive that most people are not aware of the situation. Marcuse also shows how ideas and thinking processes are being used to limit our perceptions. Marcuse is heavy going, but he has many challenging ideas. My criticism of Marcuse is that he was a materialist himself, therefore could not offer a viable way out. He did not see that the real problem was a moral collapse, and this is destroying our materialist system from the inside.If Marcuse had a spiritual outlook, he would have found the answers in a new set of non-material values.	2003-02-18

He argues that the &quot;Gnostic gospels&quot; are heretical because they were written after the &quot;true&quot; gospels.He doesn't advance any new information, and there is no reason why his speculations should be more accurate than those of anyone else.Jenkins mentions the respected scholar Walter Bauer, who claimed that there existed various Christian groups until orthodoxy was imposed by Constantine in the 4th century.Jenkins says: &quot;After Bauer, it was no longer possible to accept without question the automatic primacy of the Catholic tradition and the canonical gospels.&quot; Jenkins then goes ahead and accepts these propistions without question! In his discusssion of the &quot;Gospel of Mary&quot; Jenkins wants to downplay the role of women in the early church.The author sheds no new light on early Christianity, he simply adopts the debatable claim that the Church of Rome was the one and only true church.	2002-01-16

Commenting on the incident when Crowley did not help members of his climbing party buried in an avalanche, Sutin says Crowley did not behave like a gentleman, and would have called someone a coward who did not help him in a similar case.Such callous behavior by Crowley calls for more depth of comment because it says much about the man.If Crowley's self indulgent rituals had any value,there is no discussion by Sutin.The author says Crowley did not approve of women who abused alcohol, yet relates how many women in his life were alcoholics.Sutin does not tell us that Crowley deliberately sought out weak-willed people so that he could dominate them.The author accepts on face value the statements Crowley makes about himself and other people.Anyone who has studied Crowley knows he was an inveterate liar and could not be trusted.This book has the basic facts about Crowley's life, but lacks analysis of his character.Only a decadent age like today would be interested in a pathetic little man like Crowley.	2001-11-25

Hence Angell's views have worrying fascist implications. In his world the super-rich will rule in &quot;smart regions,&quot; and the rest of the people can just go jump.Angell expounds the logic of globalization, but he does not address the problems caused, such as the environmental crisis.He is a spin doctor for globalization.His vision of the future is a recipe for chaos.Rather than being a man for the future, the new barbarian is a dinosaur, doing his best to pull us all down.	2001-07-18

He shows that Christianity is a re-telling of the age old wisdom which is common to all humankind.The Bible is a much misunderstood book, but Kuhn provides the keys to unlock its secrets.As a carrier of a divine soul, every human has a stupendous role to play in the cosmic drama, as explained by Kuhn.Those few who are ready for this book will will get a truly mind blowing experience from it.	2001-07-15

This author has a particular way of presenting her case.She will make a criticism of kid's culture, but she won't follow it up.She will then praise aspects of kid's culture and negate her original criticism. She says: &quot;I don't want to admit that commercial manipulation is not a factor in popular culture.&quot;But she does not go on and discuss this important issue.She uses the fallacious argument that kids make their own meanings from culture.She implies that if kids like something it must therefore be good for them.This is not always the case! Kids are very impressionable and need protection from exploitation.Where do kids get this magical power to make them the actual controllers of the multi-billion corporate generated culture?The author's laughable conclusion is that kids are being liberated by popular culture. The exact reverse is happening: kids are being grossly manipulated and exploited.	2001-05-09

It does not bring her or her associates alive, as a good biography should.It says nothing about her personal relationship with her husband Dr Thomas Evans or their split up.It may be argued that her occult work was more important than her personal life, but we expect in a biography more personal details than are given here.The biography by Alan Richardson, though opinionated, is more interesting to read and gives a more extensive discussion of her novels.It is interesting to find out that when she was born Dion was thought to be dead.This happened also to pioneer mystic Anna Kingsford, an influence on Dion through McGregor Mathers and the Golden Dawn.The book gives for the first time a reliable estimate of Dion's birth time: 55 minutes past midnight(6 Dec.1890, Llandudno).Some may find the inner workings of her occult group as given interesting, but apparently the Society of the Inner Light as it exists today has moved on from the fuddy duddy stuff. We still wait for a real biography of Dion.	2001-03-18

Some  people want to pump excess carbon dioxide into the oceans, but this is like  sweeping your rubbish under the carpet.In 1986 a cloud of carbon dioxide  rose from a lake in Cameroon, killing 1700 people.&quot;The signs are  everywhere that things are out of balance.The hurricanes are stronger, the  winters milder, the summers more ferocious, and the zones of human  habitation are shrinking as the deserts spread.&quot; Parts of Africa are a  sign of the times and of things to come, where ecological breakdown has led  to social breakdown in many countries.The book paints a grim but realistic  picture, with lots of hard hitting evidence of the dangers we face.But the  authors have a positive message.We don't have to revert to a Stone Age  primitive existence.We can replace the use of oil and coal with energy  based on solar, wind and water power, and also fusion.More resources have  to be directed to these areas.Trees are our life-line, and we need many  more of them.The book puts forward practical and sensible solutions, being  cause for hope and not despair.	2000-06-27

I have a problem with this book: I can't decide whether it is serious or written with the tongue firmly planted in the cheek.Vilar's thesis is that women manipulate men by getting males to go out to work while they just take things easy.Who would do boring things like driving a bus all day if  you could get someone to be your meal ticket? she asks.Vilar says that men  and women are born with the same intellectual potential, but women choose  an animal, stupid existence over a spiritual existence.She contradicts  herself later by saying &quot;women are stupid&quot; by nature.But,women  can't be so stupid if they can turn men into their obedient slaves, as  described by Vilar.The author criticises working women too.Ugly women have  to work, but they play on their ugliness to get ahead.The 'emancipated'  woman is always complaining and blames others when she doesn't get ahead.   Vilar  damns women whatever they do.It is hard to take this book  seriously.It does not contribute in any way to a better understanding of  relations between men and women.It perpetuates old hat stereotypes that we  just don't need.The author is either an irrational woman hater, or she is  having a joke with us.	1999-10-12

As enlightening as he is,I find that Massey omits to consider the inner aspects of religion.He fails to see that the Egyptian mythos is primarily concerned with the spiritual development of man, and it uses outward Nature to symbolise inner spiritual evolution.This is explained by Alvin Kuhn in THE LOST LIGHT, who is indebted to Massey, but takes his ideas further into the spiritual and soul aspects.All in all, ANCIENT EGYPT, THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD is a unique and fascinating book.Most books written about ancient Egypt are way off beam, but this book puts you on the right track.It is a must read in order to start to understand the ancient Egyptian mythos.	1999-10-06

Fohr is  influenced by the writings of Rene Gueon and Frithjof Schuon in  particular.Although I do not subscribe to Fohr's philosophical stance, I  find that he does expand my awareness of Bible symbolism, and gives much  food for thought.It is a very good book to get you beyond Bible literalism.	1999-08-24

Silver says that genetic engineering of humans is here to stay, and we just have to accept it.Do I dectect a vested interest here? He says some parents want it, so let the market place decide.This is a very shallow  argument.You don't deal with a serious ethical and social question by  leaving it to the highest bidder.Silver never considers the very possible  dangers that are inherent in genetic engineering.Since this book was  written,Dolly the cloned sheep has shown signs of premature aging. What if  this was a human being?Silver is just too gung-ho about cloning, he doesn't  face up to the potential dangers. We must tread carefully, as side effects  could be disastrous.He says it is alright to interfer with nature, look at  the elimination of small pox.This is fair enough, but does not  automatically justify genetic engineering.He avoids facing all the trouble  man has caused by changing nature, such as splitting the atom, cutting down  forests, polluting the environment, etc.When man acts with selfish motives,  usually good does not result.Silver says that cloning can make happy and  successful people, but he does not define his philosophy of the &quot;good  life&quot;.He says some people will be made disease resistant.But what  about the rest?He admits that only a few will be able to afford genetic  engineering, but over millions of years the (alleged) benefits will flow  down to the rest of the population!!Silver ignores the social and  environmental factors which go to make up a good human life.In the final  analysis ,the quality of life depends on the values held by human beings, a  question not touched upon by Silver.I am not encouraged about the future  when people with such shallow views as Silver are in positions of  influence.	1999-07-26

Nevertheless,one does not have to accept completely  Tame's Theosophical  approach to get something out of this book.(I note in passing that there  are no diatribes involving yin and yang in the book.Tame discusses these  issues but does not bitterly criticise.)Tame does not mention Beethoven's  moon sign.In fact it was Sagittarius, thus emphasising his Sagittarian  qualities.If we knew the exact time of his birth further insight into his  character could be obtained with an accurate birth chart. I must confess  that I cannot understand why Tame allocates masculine zodiacal signs to  &quot;feminine&quot; symphonies, and vice-versa.I find Tame's argument  plausible that Beethoven did not marry because he had a higher calling,  that is ,to lift up humankind  with his music.This book has increased my  understanding of Beethoven and made me itch to get into some serious  listening of his works.	1999-04-20

Alvin Kuhn has done a magnificent job in explaining the ancient wisdom and showing its relevance for us today.This book gives a good exposition of his views.Man has two natures, the animal and the divine.Plato and Aristotle  and others wrote about the animal soul and the divine soul.The purpose of  human life is to develop the divine soul so that it can uplift the animal  soul.This is the essence of the ancient wisdom.Kuhn shows how political  Christianity turned this teaching upside down.It took the divine soul away  from man and placed it in one alleged person, Jesus Christ.This left man  empty.Christ was never a person, but a symbol of the divine soul in every  human being.Early Christians such as Paul had this teaching, but in the 3rd  century the Church became a tool of repression and the true teachings were  discarded.Kuhn brings the truth to light again in a much needed message for  our times.He shows that the Bible is not to be taken literally, but should  be understood symbolically.The ancient wisdom is right there  in the Bible  , in symbolic language.Some examples: the virgin is the constellation  Virgo;the star in the east is Sirius and the &quot;three wise men&quot; are  the three stars in the belt of Orion the Hunter;the Christ was put in a  manger, a feed trough, to be spiritual &quot;food&quot; for our animal  nature.The raising of Lazarus is a retelling of the raising of Osiris in  ancient Egypt.The name Lazarus comes from Osiris.The Bible life of the  Christ is not history, but a retelling of  the life of the divine soul in  man.Christians burnt all the books containing the ancient wisdom to try and  hide the truth from mankind.When the divine soul comes into matter it dies  and then is reborn in humans.This explains the crucifixion and the  resurrection, which do not make any sense when taken literally.All Kuhn's  books are worth reading for those interested in religion and  philosophy.This book gives a concise introduction to his ideas.If taken up,  these ideas can change the world.	1999-02-18

Nehring takes to task the postmodernists who dismiss anger and strong emotion in rock music.These critics see rock as being simply a packaged consumer product, whereas Nehring would like to think angry rock has some  sort of significance.He never explains exactly what are the positive things  this anger can achieve.He shows a lack of knowledge of psychology and true  initiation when he criticises Michael Ventura, and Robert Bly (author of  The Sibling Society), who have written with insight about the predicament  of modern youth.This book has hardly anything to say about actual music.It  is mostly negative, being a shallow critique of &quot;postmodernist&quot;  views on rock music.	1998-12-10

Leonard outlines various myths which civilization promotes  to justify itself, such as the myth of unlimited growth,the myth of the  limited good,the myth of inevitable competition,the myth of a separate  species, and the myth of glory, honor and duty.The book is full of insights  into the dis-ease that is called Civilization.He says that a major portion  of what is called education is actually the training of our screening  devices, to screen out perception of our own biofields and those of  others.Leonard is not in the business of providing some slick instant  fix.He knows that lasting transformation takes time, and is largely a  matter of awareness, especially awareness of what life should really be  about.&quot;The most radical act of this age is perhaps to experience four  straight days of joy, without anxiety or guilt or regret.Civilization  cannot survive very many such days.&quot;	1998-10-26

Everywhere a dynamic and electrical dualism appears as the foundation upon which all reality stands.&quot;Astrology gives humans a pattern of order to which they can look to overcome the chaos of earthly life.The celestial realm is a &quot;greater whole&quot; to which humans can relate and achieve integration beyond fragmenation.Nothing is static, life is a process.Astrology is the study of cyclic processes.Rudhyar looks at what each sign means in its deeper philosophic and cosmic aspects.This book gets down to the philosophic foundations of astrology and shows how relevant it is to modern life.It's a must for a deeper understanding of astrology and the universe we live in.	1998-06-02

It is claimed this is a continuing tradition, contained in folklore, tales and songs, which can transform people and in turn the Earth. Presented are visualisations to the ‘Underworld’ in order to meet faeries and other non-human entities who transmit initiatory  knowledge  to humans.<br /><br />The author says years ago he undertook visits to the Underworld and met non-human beings. One was the ‘goddess of the Underworld, the Black Isis. A long series of communications and teachings followed, from unseen but recognisable and distinct sources, mainly in sleep.’ He believed a ‘right of presence had been conferred upon me,’ and he was ordained to show people how to access the ‘Underworld.’<br /><br />The book does not specifically explain how people are changed by their alleged visits to the ‘Underworld.’ Some examples are given of brief encounters participants have with ‘faeries,’ but no inkling of the impact on their lives. There is no proof these visualisations refer to any concrete reality.<br /><br />It was a maxim of initiation in the ancient world , which still holds,  to ‘Know Thyself.’ A motor mechanic must know how a car works before he can fix it. If people want to transform themselves they must have self knowledge ( among other things). The vital question of human nature, what it is and can be,  is not examined in this book. The expression ‘off with the fairies’ sums up this book.	1998-04-19
