I was disappointed with Nicholas Sparks' The Rescue and A Bend in the Road, and I wasn't sure if I'd read his next novel.  I read Nights in Rodanthe which was very good, so I decided to read The Guardian.  I am very happy to say that this is the best book he's written since The Notebook.  It's an excellent read, that catches you off-guard and pulls you in until you just can't put the book down!  The first half of the book is a bit slow in parts, but the second half of the book is exciting, engrossing, and very fast-paced.  You will not be disappointed.  In the Author's Note at the back of this book Sparks explains how difficult this book was for him to write.  (It is quite different than his previous works.)  The Guardian is not Sparks' typical love story but is unquestionably entirely successful.  My only complaint is that sometimes his dialogue is a bit stilted and unrealistic.  (This is true in some of his other novels as well.)  It has a way of pulling me out of the story and kind of rolling my eyes.  But even so, I liked this book very much, found it believable, and the characters well-defined and realistic.  I strongly recommend it!  :&gt;	2003-11-02

A very different, thought-provoking, action packed, suspenseful novel with a first rate hero.  What would you do if you could send out copies of yourself, not just for mundane everyday chores, but for adventures as well?  And then download all the memories as if you were actually there!  I found myself completely engrossed with the adventures and misadventures of Albert Morris and his copies.  A very creative extension to the cloning debate I think!  I found that it was a little difficult at times to keep track of the main characters, but it was certainly well worth the extra effort.  I really hated to see this one end!  It's right up there with my other favorites Ender's Game by Card, The Truth Machine by Halperin, Inhuman Beings by Carroll, and Dayworld by Farmer.  Very imaginative novel and I highly recommend it.	2003-11-02

I found it to be a very true-to-life reflection of the often painful and sometimes ridiculous journey we all undertake in finding love, and at the same time, come to understand ourselves.  One of the central themes is that \\"pain changes our lives.\\"  I think that's more true than I first realized, because I'm pretty sure that happiness doesn't change us as much as pain!  One of my favorite quotes from the book is from Mirabelle when asked why she moved, she replies, \\"I'm fixing myself.\\"  I think everyone can relate to the central characters and find pieces of themselves, either past or present, in each.  Four and a half stars from me for this insightful, upbeat and enjoyable novella by Steve Martin.	2002-08-03

The first, titled \\"Betty Hutton,\\" is just plain creepy.  An ex-con struggles to avoid repeating his violent past.  When he comes upon a young woman and her little son at the beach, your skin just begins to crawl hoping against hope that he won't do them any harm.  Will he or won't he kill the old guy in the ice shack?  Will he or won't he use his gun after the card game?  I was uncomfortable reading this, and to be honest, I wouldn't have cared that much if someone had just blown him away.  I really didn't see all that many redeeming qualities in Gibbs and didn't feel much concern for his fate.<br />The second story, \\"In the Snow Forest,\\" is so emotionless, you don't really care much about these characters at the tragic ending either.  There was zero passion in their relationship, and the characters are flat and lifeless.  I understand that the author is intentionally drawing the characters in a way that illustrates life and hardships, but come on, when two people discover love, there is always some amount of excitement and joy.  I felt that the two main characters were interesting, but the author does absolutely nothing with them.<br />The last story, \\"Menno's Granddaughter,\\" was my favorite, and I enjoyed this one quite a bit, with the exception of two plot points.  Would a divorced/widowed forty year old woman in 1957 sleep with a complete stranger on a train when still upset over losing her husband?  Nothing in the character of Lindsay, as drawn by the author, really gives us too many clues into this, except of course that she's lonely and still mourning loss.  And then there's the strange \\"kiss\\" at the end of the story that seems so totally out of place in the plot.  Anyway, it was an interesting character study, but defintely flawed.<br />All in all, I can't really recommend this book.  Since there are so many glowing reviews here, I felt I needed to add my opinion.	2002-04-06

I nearly gave up on this book after 200 pages, and then finally the plot started kicking in.  I'm glad I hung in with it, but overall, just an average book and definitely not Koontz' best.  (Try From the Corner of His Eye and Sole Survivor for great Koontz reads!)  The characters are fascinating, and the plot is interesting once the author gets over his \\"simile/metaphor-itis\\" and gets down to storytelling.  It's obviously an attempt at a different kind of style, and instead of being amusing which is the intent, it's just plain obnoxious after awhile.  An example from Chapter 10 - \\"Eighteen-wheelers loaded with everything from spools of abb to zymometers, reefer semis hauling ice cream or meat, cheese or frozen dinners, flatbeds laden with concrete pipe and construction steel and railroad ties, automobile transports, slat-sided trailers carrying livestock, tankers full of gasoline, chemicals: Scores of mammoth rigs, headlights doused but cab-roof lights and marker lights colorfully aglow, encircle the pump islands in much the way that nibbling stegosaurs and grazing brontosauruses and packs of hunting theropods had eons ago circled too close to the treacherous bogs that swallowed them by the thousands, by the millions.\\"  Oh brother.  Is Koontz trying to write like Michael Chabon??  Give me a break!  Another example from Chapter 19, \\"Leilani could detect that dangerous inclination more reliably than the most talented fungi-hunting pig could locate buried truffles,...\\"  Yawn and eye roll.  It is a testament to how much I enjoyed Koontz' other books, that I hung on with this one and completed it at all.  Chop out the extra 200 pages worth of silly literary devices, and there's a decent plot here.	2002-04-01

The last two Sparks books I've read, The Rescue and this one, have just not moved me the way The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, and A Walk to Remember did.  A Bend in the Road was so predictable, that the big revelation lost all of its impact.  I did however enjoy the love story of Miles and Sarah and the setting.  But that is always two of the author's strengths - characters that you care about, and wonderfully descriptive narrative.  I'll read his next book, but the author is on \\"probation\\" now as far as I'm concerned.	2002-04-01

At times this book is funny and insightful, and every once in a while I bordered on actually liking some of the characters, but it just never worked for me. Sorry folks!

US	50406848	R3GV06FYPA1MAZ	0671027212	725696403	Frontiers	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Six Stars!	Warning - Don't pick up this book unless you have some time on your hands, because you won't want to put it down! An outstanding first novel by Michael Jensen set in the 1790's. His hero is John Chapman, a kind, gentle, caring man who we easily understand, identify with and root for. John has been ridiculed and pushed down all his life. Now he's tired of running away. All of Mr. Jensen's characters are three dimensional, well-defined and real. His dialogue is always believable and often humorous. He has a great talent for making us feel we are right there within the action of the book. And there is A LOT of action! I also learned a great deal about what living on the frontier must have been like. There are some great messages also - tolerance and respect of others and their differences, the danger of violent relationships, environmental issues, not blaming ourselves for fate's whims, but most of all through John Chapman, that we deserve to be in happy, loving relationships regardless of how others may feel. I give this book my highest recommendation. Don't miss it! I'm hoping for a sequel!	2001-08-23

I read this book two years ago, and in that time I have read a lot more gay fiction, and now have much more to compare to.  I am happy to say that I still feel comfortable recommending this book.  It's an easy little read with quite a bit of charm.  I would also like to recommend Frontiers by Michael Jensen, Funny Boy by Shyam Selvadurai, and Dream Boy by Michael Grimsley.  Below is the text from my previous review:<br />I thought I was going to hate this book after reading the first 50 pages or so, but I wound up getting pulled into the plot anyway. I enjoyed the second half, as well as the ending, and a lot of it certainly does ring true (as hard as that is for us to admit!). The author does seem to suffer from &quot;Cute Dialogue Syndrome&quot; - &quot;Our gym is full of queens like you, spending the gross national product of Peru every month on bodybuilding supplements.&quot; I am tired of writing where every response from a gay male is smart, snappy and witty! And at other times, the dialogue is just a bit unbelievable - when Brian asks John if he wants to see his cartoons, John responds, &quot;I'd love to see them. I respect creativity, I wish I had some kind of gift.&quot; WHO TALKS LIKE THIS??!! Lastly, I just hated the &quot;get in shape and dress better to keep your man&quot; moral. But, there are some good insights into relationships, what's really important in life, and the powerful seducing forces of the fast life. No, this isn't a fabulously written, intellectually stimulating, ground-breaking novel. But it is a nice, fun little read with a few good little lessons. And I just kinda liked it.	2001-08-23

It was interesting for me to compare being gay in the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's. I loved the characters in this book. You will recognize all of them. Don't let the length of this book scare you away - it's worth it, and you'll be wishing for more! His writing style takes a little getting used to as he jumps back and forth between time periods, but you'll get used to it! After I've read most books, I give them away to friends.

I picked it up in a bookstore in San Diego and was excited to begin reading.  The two main characters, Shaun and Harry, are very likable, and the setting (Northern Ireland) provides a fascinating backdrop.  It starts off at a quick pace which hooked me in quickly.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is so corny and unbelievable, that after 150 pages, I just couldn't take it any more!  The constant &quot;playful bantering&quot; between all the characters made it feel like a bad tv sitcom, and prevents the reader from ever really getting to know any of them.  In addition, Shaun and Harry constantly profess their love and adoration of each other when alone together. People in love (teenagers or otherwise) just don't act like this!  Some of the situations and plot points are also a bit farfetched.  (Not to give anything away, but the scene where Shaun's father helps him shower, and Harry's secret regarding his brother were two that I had trouble believing.)  I also wanted to learn more about life and growing up in Ireland.  Basically, all the reader gets to learn is that Protestants and Catholics still don't get along.  (I knew that.) It seems a bit of a waste of such a great setting!  When reading a good novel, you are drawn in so completely that you forget you are reading a book.  That just wasn't the case for me with this book unfortunately.  Real people just don't talk and act like this!  I skimmed the second 150 pages and I must say that there are a lot of really good story ideas there.  But the writing, and some of the plot twists designed seemingly just to titillate, prevented me from really enjoying this novel.	2001-07-30

Not many books can convey such a wide range of emotions so effectively.  It's the story of an immensely likable young boy growing up in Sri Lanka in turbulent times trying to understand himself and make sense of his crazy world.  He struggles to understand the unspoken &quot;rules&quot; and learn how to succeed and find happiness within the restrictions placed upon him.  This book is beautifully written with six chapters, each representing a separate passage of time.  (I found this to be very effective, although it did leave me with questions!)  The setting is beautiful, the characters convincing and the dialogue is believable.  You will root for Arjie!  I found the following passage from page 267 particularly insightful and relevant given the current political climate, &quot;How was it that some people got to decide what was correct or not, just or unjust?  It had to do with who was in charge; everything had to do with who held power and who didn't.&quot;  I strongly recommend this book.  (I would definitely purchase a sequel should there be one, and I plan on reading Selvadurai's next book &quot;Cinnamon Gardens&quot;.) You won't want to or be able to put this book down!	2001-07-24

All the main characters are extremely well written and believable - Evan, his mom, his brother and Hector.  I was particularly fascinated and touched by Evan's brother Peter, and the contrasts in their own self-understandings and self-acceptance.  I would certainly enjoy reading a sequel.

Having read three other Heinlein novels, I found this one to be good, but quite dated, as has been mentioned below.  (It was originally published in 1951.)  Some of the dialogue is silly and unbelievable, and some of the references are obscure.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed this fun, quick read that is very creepy in parts!  (Probably more of a 3.5 stars though, but I'll round up because of my respect for the author!) It's also clear to see that modern sci-fi novels have Heinlein to thank for some of its content and direction.  I recommend Tunnel in the Sky, The Door Into Summer and Double Star.	2001-02-26

I enjoyed The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay far more than this novel.  (I liked Mysteries of Pittsburgh better as well.)  I enjoyed the characters of James Leer and Terry Crabtree a great deal, but I found it difficult to feel much empathy for Grady Tripp.  (Although he is likable in a strange fashion.) I am familiar with the author's style, but even so, I found sections of this plot (in particular the middle) to be terribly long-winded and rather dull and uninteresting.  The Passover dinner section is torture, and I thought it would just never end.  I found Grady's wife Emily to be poorly written and unbelievable.  And who the heck are Deb and Phil and why are they in this novel??  All in all though, I actually did enjoy most of this book believe it or not.  When it's good, it's funny and wildly unpredictable.  It's just uneven and not as convincingly written.  For a great read, get a copy of Kavalier and Clay.	2001-02-26

(I will not however, give away key plot points as others have done below.)  Granted, Chabon is not for everyone.  He requires patience.  Patience well worth its rewards though.  His irritating obsession with obscure words is annoying and frustrating at times - in the first 50 pages you'll come across golem, alpinism, acromegaly, cathected, brazier, necromancer, spelunking, mucilage and pogrom among  others.  I kept a dictionary handy at first, then I just relaxed and ignored them!  (Although you will need to know &quot;golem&quot;.)  Chabon's narratives can somethimes go endlessly rambling along to the point where meaning is completely lost!  For instance on page 63 you will find a sentence with 124 words!  (Yes, I counted!) I also found the ending of the book to be a bit abrupt, and I was left with several lingering questions.  With all this in mind though, I do recommend this book.  I enjoyed this book much more than &quot;Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot;.  The characters of Kavalier and Clay were much more real for me, and the plot was moving, exciting, unusual and just plain fascinating.  I am currently reading &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;.	2001-02-02

But they are completely believable and engaging, and appropriate for all readers. They have a wonderful way of transporting you right into the story. You are hooked right from the get go. Yes, they're easy and quick to read, and somewhat predictable, but so what? I've found great life lessons in much less likely places!  I know that many will dismiss Mr. Sparks' books as fluff, but I think that any writing that moves so many people in such a positive way is indeed &quot;great literature.&quot; Buy this book, and enjoy! (And buy The Notebook and Message in a Bottle also if you haven't read them yet! I also recommend Richard Paul Evans.)  :&gt;	2001-01-08

Ender's Game remains one of my all time favorite books.  Number 2 - Speaker For the Dead was very good.  Xenocide and Children of the Mind were good, but extended the series a bit longer than necessary I felt.  I enjoyed Ender's Shadow almost as much as Ender's Game!  You're hooked right from the start!  Bean was a fascinating character in the original book, and it was great fun finding out more about his life, thoughts and personality.  Card's writing style is so fluid, his characters so interesting and real, and his dialogue is always so believable.  <br />Personally I would recommend reading Ender's Game first and then this book, then Speaker For the Dead.  If you enjoy science fiction, trust me, these three books are unforgettable and will stay with you forever!  Get ready for a journey to a different place and time you will really enjoy!  <br />(Note to future reviewers:  Please be careful not to reveal plot twists in your review as several below have done.)	2001-01-01
