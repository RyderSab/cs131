Joe Finder has written another fascinating book in \\"Company Man\\".   <br /> <br />One thing I find slightly amusing about Mr. Finder is his background in intelligence vs his writing about corporate life.  Interesting. <br /> <br />On to the book. <br /> <br />Company Man is a brilliant page-turner about a small-town company CEO who finds himself in the middle of forced job cuts due to the company's acquisition, the loss of his wife in a very little mentioned car accident, and a stalker. <br /> <br />How Nick Conover, the CEO, evolves and deals with all the situations surrounding him, as well as all the twists of fate, will keep you interested and keep you guessing! <br /> <br />Enjoy this wonderful work by Joe Finder!	2005-08-01

But the more you delve into the book, the more mysterious it becomes.  I don't want to give a full synopsis of the book and the plot; you can read that for yourself on the description section. <br /> <br />Instead, I'll tell you why I liked this book. <br />- It seemed familiar, yet unique; reminiscent of The Punisher movie, yet totally new <br />- It was brilliantly written, with enough suspense to keep you interested from cover to cover <br />- It was creepy, sort of like the aftermath of a car wreck that you don't want to see, yet you're curious about <br />- It was long enough to be a good value, but not too long so as to be boring <br /> <br />If you liked books like Red Dragon or The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris, you'll love this one.	2005-06-30

The lead character is a money hungry, cynical, wisecracking barrister who you will really enjoy getting to know.  An unlikely chess playing sidekick turns up, who is equally cynical and quick with a put-down. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great suspense legal thriller type book, and you will certainly be glad you picked this one up.	2005-06-20

Mr. Stewart has moved (somewhat) from his familiar book settings, and puts the action of A Perfect Life in a different part of the country. <br /> <br />The plot is, as usual, intriguing, with enough suspense to keep you going through the end.  The characters are well thought out and fit together. <br /> <br />I think this is a very good book, but I just don't see it being quite worthy of the 5 star absolute best rating.  However, you will definitely enjoy reading A Perfect Life by a consistently good author, Mike Stewart.	2005-06-15

While this book was fairly good, it just lacked depth.  The plot was somewhat predictable, there was no cliffhanger type moment, the character development was weak, and the ending was flat. <br /> <br />I was disappointed, to say the least.   <br /> <br />This book didn't take long to read at all, it is very simply written and does not have much substance.  It's not bad; I've read worse, but it could have been much better. <br /> <br />I doubt I will remember anything about this book in two weeks.	2005-05-20

I live a short drive across Mobile Bay from the center of the action of The Poet of Tolstoy Park, and I certainly would like to say that I enjoyed the book.  I bought this book to support a local author and hopefully enjoy a good, highly recommended book. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  Usually, I can tell within about three pages whether or not I will like a book.  With this one, it took about three paragraphs to know that this book just isn't my style.   <br /> <br />I'm sure it's a great book for people who enjoy that sort of book, but it did nothing for me. <br /> <br />Please don't take my review only - the trends for The Poet of Tolstoy Park certainly are promising, and I hope Sonny Brewer does well.  I did like the foreword from the author, but I did not enjoy the book.	2005-05-05

You are now one with the Order of the Dark Lords of the Sith.  From this day forward, the truth of you, my apprentice, now and forevermore, will be Darth...\\" <br /> <br />A pause; a questioning in the Force- <br />An answer, dark as the gap between galaxies- <br />He heard Sidious say it: his new name. <br />Vader. <br /> <br />We all knew WHAT would happen.  We just didn't know HOW it would happen.  Matthew Stover has vividly brought to life the epic bridge between the \\"old\\" and the \\"new\\".   <br /> <br />Do you feel sorry for Anakin? Can you almost feel how much he loves Padme', and how much he will do, what he will surrender, to keep her love?  Do you almost see the progression of daring young Jedi knight in love to skeptical, egotistical madman? <br /> <br />Do you feel the sorrow of Obi Wan, realizing that his Padawan, his lifelong friend, has allowed emotion to cloud his judgement? <br /> <br />Do you feel the limitless love of Padme' for her prince, and how she yearns to be with the one she loves? <br /> <br />Revenge of the Sith by Matthew Stover is a MUST read for the true Star Wars fan.  It is skillfully written, a real page turner. <br /> <br />Run out and get this one - you won't be disappointed!	2005-05-03

I can easily say that Homer Hickam is my favorite author.  I was hooked when I read The Rocket Boys (October Sky) and Sky of Stone.  Every book Mr. Hickam has written has been just as good as or better than the previous book, which is VERY high praise.  Hickam manages to spin creative tales with interesting characters and interesting plot lines, time after time.   <br /> <br />Some authors, after a little success, begin to get predictable, or they begin to lose their creative edge.  Not so with Homer Hickam!  In my opinion, there are two authors that consistently produce outstanding works - the great John Grisham and Homer Hickam.  I can only hope that Mr. Hickam's career as an author turns out to include as many books as John Grisham has produced. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful, epic tale of World War II life, and, even for younger readers like myself, born two decades after World War II, we can almost feel like we knew what it was like to be there.  I mean no disrespect to the honorable World War II veterans (and all other veterans) out there - I truly appreciate your service and I thank you for all that you did. <br /> <br />For a good, entertaining read, RUN OUT AND BUY THE AMBASSADOR'S SON!

Unless you already know what a \\"reefer\\" is (no it's not marijuana) and you know what an OOD is, and many other slang terms, you may get lost in this book and give up on it. <br /> <br />And that's unfortunate, because it IS a good book, although it's about twice as long as it really needs to be.  The theme is unique and plausible, and the action, once it FINALLY gets moving, is pretty intense. <br /> <br />If you can stick with it, you'll be pleased with this Deutermann book.  It just seems like the author said to himself \\"Well, Tom Clancy can write ridiculously long novels, why can't I\\"?	2005-03-31

Straying into the realm of international espionage, John Grisham is out of his element. <br /> <br />This book is more like something that the Tom Clancy of old would tackle, not like the tradional Grisham novel. <br /> <br />The fact that John Grisham is so gifted at storytelling is this book's one saving grace, and the one thing that saves it from being rubbish.  It isn't boring, and it isn't predictable. <br /> <br />It's a decent book, but not classic Grisham.	2005-03-07

Where Life Support was a very good but often not fluid work, the story of Life Everlasting wound its' way around intricate characters and a complex setting. <br /> <br />One would probably need to have read Life Support to appreciate the plot and some of the references in Life Everlasting, but it could be enjoyed on its' own. <br /> <br />Life Everlasting is a great book, and I am looking forward to more from Whitlow.	2005-02-28

And Chuck Norris demonstrates this by the way he lives his life. <br /> <br />After reading the biography of another sports entertainment legend (Ric Flair), it was refreshing to see someone like Chuck Norris who I would gladly let a young person view as a role model.  It would be an honor for a young person to try to emulate the behavior of Mr. Norris. <br /> <br />It was interesting to see his humble beginnings, and his determination to succeed, all the while keeping his true priorities in line.   <br /> <br />Chuck Norris is the real deal, someone who is gracious and generous (see all his work with Make a Wish); the way a celebrity who has been blessed with so much ought to be. <br /> <br />Thank you, Chuck, for redeeming my belief that one can be materially successful and still be a good (Christian) person.	2005-02-03

Whether it's right or wrong, it's his opinion.   <br /> <br />I grew up with wrestling, and I remember all the old school wrestlers like Bullet Bob Armstrong, Ricky The Dragon Steamboat, Andre the Giant, Sting, and many others.  And, whether you like to admit it or not, Ric Flair has a legitimate claim as one of those legends. <br /> <br />Ric's legacy in the wrestling industry is fortunately much greater than his legacy as a father and a role model.  He seems to be bitter about the changes in the wrestling industry, and is having a hard time adjusting (personally, I don't like the direction wrestling is going now either).  The cheap shots at other wrestlers are distasteful.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is a good book, especially for those who remember wrestling in the early 80s and beyond.	2005-01-26

It would follow that Digital Fortress would be just as good, right? <br /> <br />Not so fast. <br /> <br />The book was well written, but the book just didn't grab me like the other two.  The plot seemed dull, comparatively.  The characters seemed flat, more like cardboard cutouts than like the vivid characters of Dan Brown's other novels. <br /> <br />The ending was predictable. <br /> <br />I was not overly impressed, but I wasn't bored with it either.

The story is wholesome and reminiscent of simpler times, and the plot is superb.<br />I am definitely going to be reading more of Mr. Hickam's works, which, if you notice, all receive 4-5 stars here.  America, I think the writing of Homer Hickam will continue to do us proud!	2004-03-22

After reading this book, you will have a good understanding of just what it takes to be a SEAL.<br />The book is supplemented with many color photos, to give you just a taste of the real life behind those mental images you have built up.<br />This is a MUST READ for SEAL enthusiasts and fans of hard charging, tough as nails military reality.<br />Hooyah!	2004-03-08

It seems almost as if a high school student had a crazy idea for a short story, then was prodded on by their teacher to turn it into a several hundred page book.  I can barely even get through the first few chapters, much less finish the book.  It seems to me that Peretti has a loser in this one.  The Visitation, alse by Peretti, is a MUCH better book, and is MUCH more interesting.<br />I guess you could read this book at night if you need help falling asleep.	2003-07-14

As always, I picked up a Jonathan Kellerman novel and began to read.  Hours later, still sitting in that same spot, I knew I was hooked!! Fortunately, I am a frequent business traveler, and I can read on planes and in hotel rooms. But, darn you Kellerman, I won't even begin to try and count the hours of sleep that I lost because I'd rather be reading one of your witty novels!!<br />The plot is masterful, Alex Delaware as a semi-lead role (along with Milo) is believable and instantly likeable, and potential villains lurk behind every corner.  <br />I'm hooked!! I keep reading more and more of Jonathan Kellerman's books, and, I have NEVER been disappointed!!	2002-09-03

This book starts out a little slow, and seems like it will be another boring book that won't leave much of an impression.  Then, the plot starts to develop, and BAM!! You're hooked!! <br />Give this one a chance - you won't be disappointed!	2002-05-03

I won't go into the plot, which has been summarized before.  Unlike some other authors, Mike Stewart is sticking with the same basic formula that has made him successful with his previous books - the book is well written, interesting, and, full of action.  Zybo is a character that you'll immediately become fascinated with.  <br />Overall - GREAT book!! Highly recommended!	2002-05-03

I found myself running through some scenarios to try and figure out my best guess to what was going on, and was completely surprised with the ending.  Being about a pharmaceutical company, this book is loaded with medical terminology and is pretty much on the mark in some rather complex principles.  There were TONS of characters in this one, maybe a few too many.  I had to keep up with who was doing what, who was on who's side, and who worked for which outfit.  This only adds to the mystery of the novel, and, overall, I was really impressed with this one.  I'll be reading more of Mr Margolin's works!	2002-02-21

Overall, I think it is a great collection of short stories that, for the most part, are entertaining to read.<br />Here's one of the main problems that I have with the book. If it's a collection of stories about New Orleans Mardi Gras, why do most of the stories appear to be written by British authors? If you look, you'll see some traits of UK vocabulary and spelling, such as using \\"realise\\" when a US author would have spelled it \\"realize\\". That doesn't give these authors as much credibility to me, but, who really cares?<br />I think the last story of the book was DEFINITELY the best.  If you've ever been to New Orleans and done one of the Haunted History tours, you'll surely recognize the characters in this story.  Wonderful!!	2002-01-30

Just like everyone else, I have been waiting anxiously to get this book, and I finished it within about three days.  The plot is just masterful, and as soon as you get into one melee, you want to see how it finishes out before you quit reading.  There are tons of characters, though, so you have to keep a perspective of who's who, because they all have a pretty major role in the book.<br />This is a great book, just like all the others in the series, and you DEFINITELY won't be disappointed!!!	2001-11-07

I too have read all his previous books, and was anxoius to get The Shark Mutiny.  The inexcusable error of having the incorrect address for the White House at the beginning of the book sets the tone for a VERY dull book.<br />I rarely lose interest in a book before I finish reading it, but, I just HAD to put this one down.  If you want an exciting military thriller, check out some of Patrick Robinson's works.  If you want a book to put you to sleep at night, get this one.  Otherwise, don't bother.	2001-08-15

If this book didn't keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what could possibly happen next, I don't know what would.  Up until the last few paragraphs, the book twisted and turned with all sorts of possible changes.  <br />True to form, Mr Stewart has written an excellent book, with characters that are good, but not quite as good as his first work, Sins of the Brother.<br />There is one picky detail that I'm stuck on, since I live in Mobile.  The last time I checked, I-65 runs north/south, and I-10 runs east/west....	2001-08-15

Mike Stewart will be one of those authors to watch over the next several years.  I live in Mobile, Alabama, and was just thrilled to read a book set near where I live.  Stewart does a masterful job of developing characters, providing insight into several different mentalities. And the twists and turns of this book - amazing!!Mo	2001-07-28

The action of A King's Ransom is fast-paced and interesting, keeping you guessing all the way!!

The plot seems to drag on and on and on and on and on... well, you get the picture. Obi-wan was developed fairly well, but the rest of the characters left something to be desired. I'd agree that, unless you are a pretty die-hard Star Wars fan, this book probably won't be for you.  If you are, it's a decent read.	2001-07-18

Thomas Harris has created a masterpiece, making you feel as though you know each major character all too well.  In the case of The Dragon, you feel a twinge of sympathy, yet an overwhelming wave of utter shock and disgust.  This is another one of those that you just can't put down.  Definitely not for those who are faint at heart and don't like graphic scenes.<br />And just when you think the story is over and get the &quot;what, could that be it&quot;? thought, ala Blair Witch Project, more imaginative and brilliant writing begins to unfold......	2001-05-03
