It is an attempt at portraiture of the most reticent of our forefathers.  Ellis explores the mind and emotions of Washington through his known actions and known information about him from his own words and those of others who were there with him.  What is the nature of his greatness?  Why was he the right person at the right time?  What did he contribute to the beginnings of our country?  There are struggles for Ellis, such as Washington's attitudes and actions regarding slavery.  But there is a real excitement in that struggle, the uplift of Ellis trying to fathom the inner workings of this great man at this unique time in our history, with its unique needs.   <br /> <br />Washington emerges from this exploration as a man of vision, of experiential intelligence, of physical courage, and of undiminishing dedication.  At one and the same time, Ellis succeeds in penetrating the mythical ikon while not faltering to sometimes-fashionable denigration or apologetic idealization.  By doing that, he makes Washington vivid, and however imperfect, most admirable. <br /> <br />It does, indeed, establish one criterion by which we might judge our current political leaders.  It does, also, help define who we are as a nation by seeing more clearly this aspect of our origins.  It does, finally, make one proud of that heritage, and thankful for that blessing. <br />	2004-12-30

This book not only relates the exciting battles of Trenton and Princeton, but does so as a multi-perspective portrait of the various elements of the British army and political environment.  The description of the first battle of Trenton - an attack by the desperate American forces facing an unexpected sleet storm - is mesmerizing.  Fischer's set of perspectives that only makes more vivid the central events and the central figure, George Washington.  It only adds to the reputation of a man who, with less education, understood most deeply the requirements of a leader in this unique situation, and adapted to a new strategy of guerilla warfare that made what seemed an impossible victory possible.  It is downright inspiring. <br /> <br />Fischer writes with dramatic insight, with a wide-ranging respectful empathy for all sides in this pivotal conflict, and with a main focus upon the great man in its midst.	2004-12-20

It is a talent wildly under-appreciated until one seeks out those few examples of truly funny books: currently, David Lodge, last century, P.G. Wodehouse.  A few others.  And then there are the Dortmunder novels by Westlake, who takes the mystery genre and turns it into clever, lovable, hilarious adventures of these star-crossed robbers.  <br />This one, his most recent, returns to the level of his earlier ones, those memorable ones like the serial robberies in HOT ROCKS and &quot;bank-robbing&quot; taken too literally in BANK SHOT and the un-robbery of WHY ME? <br />These are shamelessly shallow feel-good lovable entertainments: a rare accomplishment for any novelist in any period.

It is also about two Jewish men, both brought up in Vienna at the height of its anti-Semitism; it's about mid-century history, the consequences and personal intellectual and deeply emotional responses, the hope and despair, that came out of two world wars and the haolacaust.  It is also about what might be seen as the dry heights of philosophical argument, as two men whose entire lives are devoted to different visions, commitments to different definitions of one's role in a tumultuous, terrifying and endlessly pioneering time in our lives.  <br />This book is extraordinary in its extending this one short meeting, these two seemingly ego-centric and insulated academics and their philosophies, to something that matters.	2003-12-27

Fitzgerald, in this book as with another I've read, shows herself to be a precise and evocative miniaturist.  The sweep of the events surrounding the main character, the English gentleman Frank, is brought into his small world, one of limited perceptions and a desperate need for equilibrium.  A great deal of the novel is happening out of the range of Frank, and just as much is unperceived or misperceived by Frank.  So that the ending is a series of shocks, some of which are not quite comprehensible.  <br />Frank sees it all in domestic terms: his wife has left him, and left him with the chidlren; he is advised by his friend, the seemingly muddle-headed idealist Selwyn; visited by his brother-in-law, also seeming to be muddle-headed, Charlie.  But the Russian Revolution is swirling around him, and encroaches upon that world, re-defining this crisis in Frank's small life.  <br />Fitzgerald at once brings a wry humor to the novel, but it has an Austen edge to it, and is in an environment that adds a shadow of pervading seriousness.  At the same time, we see more than Frank but less than many others, caught between the English humor and the socio-political storm.<br />It is a subtle and provocative book.  And short.	2003-07-22

While Rendell's kernel idea, that a person's inability to read, the limits of the world thus caused, the shame it brings her, the desperate need to hide her inability, defines her life and her final fate, is a bit of a stretch, she is completely convincing in developing it in a step-by-step progression to what then seems inevitable.  The main character's very ordinariness is what makes the story so horrible.  It is a provocative idea, skillfully executed.	2003-06-24

It comprises a number of interviews Cramer had with Williams at that time,a nd then updates it with his decline through illness until his recent death.  <br />I admit to a not-uncommon trait, for those may age, of holding Ted Williams up as one of my boyhood heroes: to see him up at bat in those late 40's-early 50's was nothing short of beautiful.  In this book, he is shown as a cantankerous retiree, uncompromising in his earned egoism, unfussy demand for privacy, crusty narrowmindedness, complete dedication to baseball and sport fishing and the seeking of perfection in both those.  And his failure as a family man, in his marriages and his fatherings.  <br />But in this latter trait, he mellowed and made up for alot of his past mistakes, which he understood and, if not admitted, tried to make a second effort.  And, ironically, his life becomes one of the touching love stories with his last companion, a woman who fell in love with him immediately,w aited through his three failed marriages, and then had sense enough not to marry him herself but to live with him until her own death, loving him with that open-eyed strength that makes a true match.<br />Cramer also loves this larger-than-life figure, but in that same open-eyed way that makes a fine essay.	2002-12-24

His views on the transformation of ideology during the Revolution, the innovations during the Confederacy period, the basic conceptual shift represented by the Constitution, are communicated with clarity and insight.

It is not only the story of a set of friendships, but also of two different yet equally complex long-term marriages.  And it is, on yet another level, as a remembrance by the writer/character Larry, an exploration of how the novel, how art, touches upon reality, real life, when trying to portray &quot;ordinary&quot; lives, without seeming to impose a structure and meaning that misshape that experience.  And, on yet another level, it is about the inability of individuals to control his/her life, that there are those elements of chance, both good and unfortunate, which deny that control we sometimes think we have.  In the novel's case, the fortunate chance that the Langs meet the Morgans in some small college in the midwest in the midst of the depression; alongside the unfortunate happenstance of Sally Morgan's contracting polio.  <br />The novel tries very hard, through its narrator, to portray ordinary lives(albeit academics and upper/upper-middle class).  It is also about the complexities of love, both familial/marital and the love between friends.  <br />And, while unassumingly achieving all that, it brings to the pages the splendid character of Charity Lang, who is at the center of this novel.  <br />That these two couples remain friends, that these marriages - in their complexities of romance and misplaced ambitions and egoisms - forbear in lasting love, is the novel's affirmation.	2002-09-16

And, again, I find his humor gently heartfelt, his guy-perspective identifiably familiar to me, and his craftsmanship assured.  This is a more somber effort, about a man in mid-life neurosis, an artist at the end of his commercial rope, his lovable marriage at a sudden end.  While it sustains a humor that derives from an understanding and ultimately lighthearted attitude towards the modern urban environment, and the distresses of the middle-age male, it also delves the intellectual and emotional depths that approach the shadowy landscape of despair.  <br />And Lodge does some showing off, in taking ont he voices of the women characters only to reveal the \\"author's\\" voice.  And his style moves from Neil Simon-like one-liners to a more somber and perceptively introspective mode, as part of Passmore's journey towards a renewed maturity.<br />Lodge does seem to flail a bit to find a resolution to these new depths and tone of his work, between the nostalgia of a first-love renewed and a still-loved but lost wife.  He does not surrender to gross sentimentality.  But the book does paint itself into a corner, in which only sentimentality of some sort is possible.<br />Lodge is a most likeable writer.  And one who respectfully confronts the male world with a smile.	2002-07-17

This one centers on a quiet and unnoticed psychopath. As she often does, Rendell places two stories side by side, and brings them together in a mind-blowing resolution. Here, the story of one man's romance with a woman married to a violent mate, and a psychopath brought to the edge by seemingly tiny cirucmstances. It may be a bit schematic - two men who coinicdentally have the same first initial and last name, a woman who leaves her violent husband just as the other story has reached a climactic crisis - but it is so much fun, so imaginative and not-quite-predictable, and such a fitting reader-revenge - that it is forgiveable. <br />It does seem: you can always count on Rendell.	2002-04-14

This is unfortunate.  He invented the police procedural, with THE MISSING MAN being one of those from a small-town Connecticut police department headed by Fellows.  This one has the usual splendid ending, after a methodical chase for a clever murderer/con man. Waugh never cuts through the more humdrum procedures of the police in favor of tough-guy glitz and plot-cheating; nor does he make it boring as one follows along Fellows' methodical tracking to a satisfying, well-earned, ending.  This novel, modest yet crafted with care, is one reason that Waugh belongs in the canon of American mystery writers.	2001-11-06

And that is a beguiling perspective, and a frightening one, which is - importantly - guilded with a sharp sense of humor, especially refreshing for one in that devestating state. And, for awhile, that's enough. Because Aubert does keepone guessing, as to whom is killing all those 8 year-old boys and defacing them horribly. But then, the solution begins to develop through ever-more murders, including several attacks upon the woman herself, for - it turns out - no better reason than hate. And through this dung-heap of violence, one begins to notice one wildly improbable event after another - a coincidence here, a relationship out of the blue there, a connection that's as farfetched as a satellite from Pluto... And then you come to the climactic revelation. Through the longest scene of melodramatic mishmash I've endured for quite some time. Just as the French admire Jerry Lewis, this prize-winner is inexplicable to me.	2001-09-06

It is, otherwise, solidly factual, both in the integrity of the sources and the density of the details.<BR>Indeed, the style of the writing is determined by Zobel's seeming primary concern to bring to the page these details, in a way that belies a lack of writing ability. For example, one of many minor character's name (e.g. Matchett, John Codman, Elias Depree,all on one page) is brought to the page without explanation of who this person is, of what significance, mentioned often again in the same way, so that one is left without a clue as to the proportionate importance of these many names. Other times, he introduces a person with a brief biography, only to leave it for 50 pages or more before returning to him in his significant context. He has no sense of persepective for the larger events of the day - for instance, that the activities of the so-called \\"mob\\" of American radicals was hardly violent in comparison to the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution, or indeed, just about any other revolution in the history of the world. He makes no distinction between a minor act of resistance and a major one.<BR>But what is most negative is his interpretation of these events. He forever gives the worst motives to the American rebels, especially a devious and manipulative Samuel Adams, whom he also couples with drunken \\"mobs\\", failing to point out that Adams was a non-drinker himself. While Samuel Adams is a ruthless demagogue, who is intent upon brutishly moving Boston to the brink of civil war with mob action, he at the same time admits that the \\"mobs\\" were very well controlled, and fails to point out that in almost all cases property damage occured, and that physical violence almost always amounted to harsh pranks (tar and feathering, for instance), as if property damage and the threat of violence equals murderous action. He even goes to the ridiculous extent of accusing Adams' INaction of dire motives: \\"Sam Adams, by his very inaction, unmistakably conveyed the threat of violence\\", a case of damned-if-he-does-damned-if-he-doesn't. By not pointing out that James Otis was probably manic depressive, he makes this brilliant but emotionally fragile man seem like an idiot. At the same time, he interprets British actions as merely incompetent, indeed goes out of his way to point to their lack of evil intent or even sympathy towards Boston's citizens. Failing to point out that Britain was sucking America dry, and had a thoroughly abrasive condescension towards Americans that amounted to repression. John Adams is seen as, however brilliant in only one of his trial speeches (reluctantly acknowledged by Zobel) is in cahoots with the rebels, and is mostly after a lawyer's fees. Zobel will revert to the most outlandishly convoluted motives to make a negative point about these - to him - vicious Americans, as when NOT killing Richardson and Wilmot in the Seider incident: \\"If the mob let them live long enough to be convicted, they both could hang.\\" Time and again, one rebel after another, is seen in this light by Zobel, within an environment which Zobel refuses to see in any but a modern context, and even then disallowing civil disobedience which he considers oh-so-uncivil, rather than in any way sincere or justified.<BR><br />Both as a work of literature, and as a work of history, Zobel fails - to be entertaining, or to be in the least fair-minded.  At the time of its publication, a large number of vastly more credible historians voiced strong criticism of this book, including the pre-eminent historian of the period,Bernard Bailyn.	2001-09-03

He is a journalist by &quot;trade&quot;, and that shows in his research - here, an extraordinary and nuanced knowledge of fencing, Spanish and 19th century, as well as Spanish political history.  The prose is often lambent, overwhelming the storyline, the usual devices and limitations of mystery novels and historical novels.  Those who read it as either of these will be - and by the reviews here, were - disappointed.  that is understandable, but unwarranted.  This novel of his is different, more than that, but still tethered to those genres, trying to stretch past them but confusedly not quite achieving that.  <br />In Perez-Riverte, in this first novel of his I've read, there seems a talent not unlike P.D. James, a prose talent arching over the mystery genre.  And an intellectual curiosity that touches the same world as, let's say, Byatt.  It is often hypnotic, and it is a puzzle.

She is the voice of this novel, one of edgy humor, the pathos of repressed and unrealized romanticism, and an acceptance of men's lax attitude towards her without a trace of self-pity.  Pym does indeed remind one of Austen, in her voicing of women in a secondary place in society, too dependent upon men and marriage, in an era now gone-by, the era of postwar England no less distant than Austen's.  &quot;Excellent women&quot; are those &quot;old maids&quot; who are not very attractive physically, and are therefore - however unfairly - the half-seen nurturers of their society.  The men are - each and every one - presumptuous, myopic, self-indulgent.

Except for one instance, there is no philosophizing beyond the limits of  his limited main character.  And it is about the new South Africa, from the  point of view of an older Africaaner.  His world seems to be turned upside  down, with the dominance of whites over Blacks being overthrown and  replaced by - for him - a kind of chaos of foreign-ness.  <br />Coetzee  tackles this rich material with symbolism, a complex network of contrasts  and parallels, and suggestions of &quot;applications&quot; to that more  generalized social and political milieu.  So that Professor Lurie's  &quot;disgrace&quot;, his removal from his professorship because of a  dalliance with one of his students is not unsimilar - we are to believe -  from his daughter's being raped by three Black South AFricans.  That he is  a communications teacher has significance; that she is a lesbian has  significance.  That he helps Bev &quot;put down&quot; with humanity  unwanted dogs whose owners are unwilling to sterilize them instead, has  significance.  That Lurie is middle-aged and urban, his daughter in the  transitional generation and choosing a rural life, is significant.  This is  not to say that his novel is schematic, that is has the sort of one-for-one  obvious symbolism.  It is a symbolism of suggestion, of indirection.  It is  no more simple than the flawed main character.  It is even beyond the  simpler Blacks-good-Whites-bad viewpoint of a less precise and perceptive  artist.<br />But it does make it seem, finally, intellectual.  It does,  finally, place a wall of the writer's making between the subject and the  more direct emotions of the subject.  It is, through the main character,  rape without a response of active rage, being outcast without crying shame  or outraged denial, a social system turned dreadfully upside down and  inside out witha response of aging acceptance.  So that it is, finally,  not very exciting.	2000-07-02

This one, late in her career, is a bit complicated at  first with a myriad of relatives and relationships.

This is my first book by McEwen, who has more recently won the Booker Prize.  It is written in the style of a pseudo-documentary, its main character being a sceince writer of struggling rationality confronted with  an emotionally disturbed mystic, making that all the more fitting.  It is  compelte with footnotes, at least some of which are imaginary, and a  scientific paper that is imaginary.  This patina of scientific fact is  fascinating, if also moving the reader to a dsitance from the emotional  texture of what is depicted.  And being from a single point of view,  punctured only by letters from the disturbed person and one from the  victim's lover, it brings to the landscape of a rational scientific mind a  world of wild emotions and mystical inexplicables.  <br />So that McEwen,  through these techniques and with this story, is exploring whole worlds of  social realities.  It is, then, an ambitious work and is in many aspects  quite successful. <br />Along with that, the story itself has a cumulative  suspense, a sense of an inevitable tragedy (that does not quite happen), a  sad deconstruction of a loving but untested marital-type relationship.  The  writing, the viewpoint through the sensibilities of its narrator, is cool  and crafted, the high emotions combining with intellectual considerations.   That makes it unusual, and a bit difficult, but not without its rewards.	1999-10-09

Her descent, by choices of her own that are predetermined by  her background and victimized by the hypocrisy and cruelty of that world,  is painful.  Because there is the opportunity, time and again, to escape or  to successfully join that society, and one understands as Lily makes just  those choices that doom her.  And the awful proximity of the man who should  have been the love of her life, Seldon, whose own timidity and small-minded  self-righteousness seal the failure.

It is about being Jewish in a non-Jewish  world, about being bone-deep religious in a world where religiosity is not  common, about submitting oneself to the dictates of community rules in a  society that prides itself on the oppposite.  Yet the two contrasting sons  of the Rev Kirshner's family seem not unfamiliar, the plight of Elizabeth  pulled between the growing sense of her subculture's strictures and the  larger but frightening possibilities outside that, the chasm betw3een the  older man tied to his sisters and his young wife Nina - these seem part of  a microcosm of any world, however small, however specifically different.

The main character, Herbie Bookbinder, is fat, awkward and  bright, an eleven-year-old goofy-eyed over red-head Lucille.  The story  revolves around that relationship, centering on Herbie's first summer camp  experience, his first time out of the city.  And is connected to his father  - co-owner of an ice making factory - who is threatened with a buy-out.    The connection between the two is a bit far-fetched.   but that is part of  the sentimentality of Wouk's view of childhood, a kind of innocence and  basic good nature he sees as childhood, howevermuch rough-housing there is  about it.  This is contrasted to the sometimes-meanness of the adults.  But  Herbie's parents are, of course, also sentimentalized in their caricatured  roles as disciplinarian and nurturer.   It is an entertaining book.  But  there is about it a myopia, both about childhood, and about the  Jewish-American community of that generation.  While the rosy-colored view  of both is reassuring, it is also not very incisive, not wholly truthful,  and sometimes sweetly manipulative.	1998-11-25

The author's delicate simple prose exudes a charm that personifies  his main character, a character with a naivete which may be covering the  deep sadness of widowhood.  <br />But there is also a predictability about the  progress of this novel.  I, and I think most readers, foresee Pereira's  journey towards a moral stance.  That is sometimes a part of a book's  pleasure, its sense of inevitability.   Here, I think, it is for most  people a comfortable affirmation.  One sees an average guy come to  understand the evil of Fascism and then involve himself against it.  In  fact, very few in Europe did that, however much they wish to think  otherwise.  The norm was inaction.  Pereira is given an extraordinary  degree of naivete, an innocence about what is going on around him, even  though he is an older man, even though he has had a past career as a crime  reporter.  But that naivete, too, is comfortable, because it says to the  reader such insulation at such times is understandable - it's nice to think  so.  <br />So that, however fine a stylist and however righteous his theme,  this book seems to me a comforting apologia, a half truth.	1998-10-21

Through the seasons, Hass introduces modern poets and  not-so-modern, with a story, some biographical tidbits, an appreciative  interpretation.  His affection for poetry is on every page, his  appreciation broad and deep, and his touch with those of us who are not  used to reading poetry very often is sensitive.  As a book to dip into time  and again, as a book to introduce oneself to modern poetry and poets and  the traditions from which they sprang, as a gift of one fine poet to a  wider audience ... this book is a gem.	1998-10-13

While unmistakably Green is a skilled if idiosyncratic novelist, and the  focus of its attention is on a quite charming story of love between two  servants in an English/Irish household, that central story is muffled into  unexcitement.  Green does contrast the virtue and integrity of the  servants' love relationship with that of the aristocrats' adulterous  hypocrisy.  And there is a sense of verrisimilitude about both the worlds  of &quot;upstairs&quot; and &quot;downstairs&quot;.  But, finally, the  central story tells us more than it shows about the loving relationship,  without display, without actions sufficient to be compelling.  Maybe that's  a comment in itself on English society of this World War II period.  But it  makes for a dry read.	1998-08-24

This is a surprisingly fine novel, so often overlooked, by James.  About the usual upper-class Londoners near the turn of the century.  In this case, disturbed by the arrival of an acquaintance of the earlier generation, one women in particular, and his effect upon the marital prospects of that woman's granddaughter, with whom he establishes a special relationship.  Each person has an agenda, often at complex cross-purposes, filtered through misunderstandings, indirectness in communications, and the hypocrisy of greed and social ambitions.  One need only get through James' penchant for the prepositional phrase, and his characters' habit of so seldom saying anything simply and directly.  to be rewarded with a rare reading experience.	1998-08-01

There are lots of elements of Patterson's novel that one could fault: the sentimentality of the idealized Alex Cross in his new love life (with a new &quot;serious&quot; love interest he forgets not only about the fling he had with a fellow worker in a previous novel but even his dead wife) and his mother and young children and friend Sampson, the patching together of two stories - the old Soneji and the new Mr. Smith, and the anti-climaxes of their respective demises.  <br />Sure.  But then there is Patterson's mastery of the short chapter, in which one action is completed moving us to the next short cahpter, the pacing that's like a motion picture but taking advantage of novelistic devices, the good-vs.-evil patterns that he satisfies.  It is really hard to put down this book, for all those reasons, and those virtues overwhelm his faults.  The romantic interest is certainly sentimental, as is his adoration of his children, but it raises the stakes, humanizes the otherwise action-centeredness, and is always heartfelt.  The idealization of Alex Cross is done with a care for a definition of real decency.  The anti-climaxes soften the hovering over detailed morbidity (that has become so much a part of Cornwell, for instance).  <br />Patterson is alot of second-rate things, but he is a first-rate entertainment.	1998-07-05

Having read THE SCULPTRESS, I found this effort by Walters less satisfying.  While the character of Jinx is fascinating and full of possibilities, and the perspectives of her therapist and various policepersons is cleverly depicted, with all its intricacies Walters comes up with a resolution that reveals nothing much, and a journey for Jinx that is sentimental in its shallowness.  Walters is superb in her construction, in leading her reader - me at least - up all sorts of alleyways of possibilities, into all kinds of corners of personality.  But it does not, finally, add up to anything.  Which is what I expect from the best of our mystery writers: the P.D. James's, Mosleys, etc.  This effort, so dependent on psychological intricacies, demands a resolution that brings insight, that challenges our presumptions.  Here, for Walters, none of that is accomplished.	1998-06-29

More than that, the story begins with a scene that is explained as an incredible coincidence pointing to our heroine as the murderer.  I kept thinking, &quot;No, this is a device to mislead me&quot; but it was not the clever intricacy I'd been waiting for.  It was just plain silliness.  This is not just a small problem; this is the kind of mystery in which one must suspend commonsense.  Some people can accept that fantasyland escapism.  For them I've got a great bridge to Brooklyn cheap.	1998-06-29

Updike continues to elicit, from me,a mixed reaction: on the one hand, he is clearly a spectacular stylist, with an incredible sensory encyclopedia of detail, a fine command of the language, and an ambition to reach out and capture the portrait of an entire social era.  And yet, ultimately, he portrays these middle-class people with condescension.  People who are, finally, just pathetic in their confusion, usually aimless and shallow and irresponsible.  In the figure of Rabbit himself, Harry Angstrom, one experiences a largely passive, terribly irresponsible man who hardly realizes the moral dimensions of his experience.  Married to a woman who is equally irresponsible in abandoning her child, equally shallow in equating sexual fulfillment and an encouragement of self-esteem from a man who is unwilling to make a marital commitment to her and has an affair with her own sister-in-law and then settles for her unsatisfactory marriage fatalistically.  It's as if Updike sees these middle-class people as stupid and aimless and amoral, in an era - the sixties, which overwhelms them.  And he meanwhile elevates their language to his own, giving them insights that are pointless to their lives as he sees them, and not realistically and respectfully a part of who they are.  Here is a talented writer who chooses to write about a society of people he doesn't care about.	1998-06-04

And the feel of the island is nicely drawn by Langton, if not with particular colorfulness.  the incredible coincidence at the core of the mystery, however, undermines the novel.
