The author covers everything from personal statements to Loan repayment programs at top schools.  The author focus on top twenty schools but the information should be helpful to anyone.  The best part is hundreds of quotes on all subjects directly from the deans of admissions at top schools.  It includes quotes from the deans at every school in the top 15 in the U.S. News and world report rankings and a number of other institutions including Boston College, George Washington, USC, UCLA, and Boston University.  This is particularly helpful if you are targeting one of these top schools.  There are executive summaries at the end of the chapters if you don't have time to read the entire book. This work will help anyone taking the application process seriously to maximize their chances of getting into the best school they can.	2005-10-12

There is suprisingly little information.  For example, the book mentions that there are a few companies that give day tours from Rekyavik but doesnt tell you anything about how they compare in price or services.  basically, everything in the guide and more can be found at the tourist information center in Rekyavik, which luckily is run very well.  I found this really disappointing since Iceland is very expensive and I was hoping to keep down costs (in reality this is almost impossible, even eating at the grocery store I was spending 10 dollars a meal for bread and cheese) Furthermore, Iceland is a very small country and it would have been very easy to have given a lot more details. <br /> <br />As with any tour book some of the info is out of date.  some of the museums and businesses were closed including the Icelandic Phallogical Museum.  It also seemed that this book was written for the high season in the summer months.  I went in March and found the information on the offseason limited and sometimes inaccurate.  I usually trust Lonely Planet but in this case I would have tried one of the other guide book companies or simply visit the tourist center when you get there.	2005-03-22

This work provides a view of Iran that is highly accessible even to the most uneducated reader.  At the same time this should appeal to the expert for its frank and interesting depiction of everyday life in Iran.  Furthermore the author has taken a difficult topic but approached it in a light-hearted way that proves to be much more enjoyable and entertainable for the reader.  This work is certainly worth the short amount of time it will take you to read it.	2005-02-19

However, the price is well worth it if you have an interest in multiple slavic (or slavonic) languages.  This book is primarily for linguists but would be interesting for anyone with a love for languages.  There is some technical jargon but not too much.  I myself am not a linguist but was able to understand quite easily.   <br /> <br />The book contains chapters on fourteen languages including the following: PRoto-Slavonic, Old Church Slavonic, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, Czech, Slovak, Sorbian, Polish, Cassubian, Polabian, Russian, Belorussian, and Ukrainian. Each Chapter contains six sections as follows:  1. Introduction/history of the language 2.Phonology 3. Morphology 4. Syntax 5. Lexiography 6. Dialects <br /> <br />Each of the chapters is written by a different expert.  I found the Bulgarian and the Serbo-Croatian section to be both helpful and complete conjugation charts and declension patterns are included in their respective languages.  There is also a good discusions of similarities and differences between each of the languages.  Overall you will not be able to find a more complete and percise grammar summary of all the slavic languages.  This book is well worth your time and money.	2005-02-03

This book jumps around a lot and has only a very loose structure.  It does not give a chronological account of Lenin's life.  On one page he jumps from 1917 to 1921 back to 1918 and then jumps to 1964 and Breshnev's reign.  This in and of itself is not a problem, but Volkogonov does not connect a lot of his arguments and mearly skips around.<br />Likewise, he often strays too far from his subject. Almost half of the book is devoted to explaining the lives and evnets of leaders other than Lenin.  This ranges from Stalin to The Meneshevik, Martov. The leader will learn a great deal about many Soviet personalities, unfortunately Lenin is not necessarilly one of them.  Volkogonov seems bent on radically changing the historical view of Lenin.  At times, his bias compromises his work, and he tries to blame Lenin for all of the USSR's problems, including collectivization and many items usually associated with Stalin.<br />In his quest to revolutionize history, the author dismisses many previous arguments.  Unfortunately, he often does not give them proper attention.  The work is interesting but fails to fairly treat the complex character of Lenin. There are many biographies of Lenin that are better than this one.	2004-05-27

More importantly he is the best.  This book offers the most complete picture available on the figure of Joseph Smith the third.  In addition, it gives some great information on the formation of the RLDS church.   Despite Lanius' connection with the RLDS, this book shows little if any bias. It is a fair and accurate portrayal of the \\"pragmatic prophet\\"  Overall, it is definitely worth the time of anyone interested in the RLDS, polygamy, Emma Smith or the succession crisis that occurred after the death of Joseph Smith.	2004-05-25

Pratt along with his brother Orson was among the earliest leaders of the Mormon church.  His historical significance alone makes this worth the read.  Luckily not only is this work historically important is is also really entertaining.  Of all the books I have read on the early church this was easily the most entertaining.<br />Parley Pratt is a master storyteller.  Furthermore, he lead a fascinating life that makes for an engrossing read.  My favorite was the story about the dogs. (You have to read it to find out what I mean) There is some inspirational talk here as would be expected from any work by a religious devotee.  Really a fun read and worth your time.	2004-05-25

However, this is not the case.  The author, a former ambassodor to the Sudan, seems content to merely catalogue the meetings he had with Sudanese officials.  Thus the book only addresses the time form 1992-95.  Furthermore, the writing reads like a travel log and is rather uninteresting.  The book claism to be an acoount of US-Sudanese relations, but even in this area it falls short.  There is very little critical analysis and the work is littered with unimportant personal imformation.  The book does give a look at life in a Us Embassy but this hardly makes up for its other shortcomings.<br />One good aspect of the work is Petterson's criticism of the media.  For far too long has this atrocity been largely ignored by such agencies as CNN.  Likewise, he also gives the reader some insight into the workings of Sudanese NGO's whose primary objective is not to relieve suffereing but rather to spread Islamic fundamentalism.  Overall there are better books on the Sudan.	2004-05-21

Unlike its predecessor, This work is not driven both by character development and plot.  In fact since the plot is already mostly know it is almost evntoirely based on the character of Bean.  At first it seems like this will work out very well. The first part of the book where Bean lives on the streets of Rotterdam are fascinating, but things go downhill aftre that.  Amazingly despite the fact that the whole book is aimed at developing Bean as a character hhe remains remarkably flat throughout. Furthermore Ender is pushed to the back almost as if he is a nonessential character in the story.<BR>On the up side, the plot moves along quickly.  for old fans of the battle school getting caught back up in the setting will not be difficult. Overall the work is entertaining but not on the level of Ender's game.	2004-05-20

This book is the most basic &quot;investing book&quot; I have ever read.  Essentially, Tigue's guide states you should start investing now invest every month and but good divedends paying stock.  Well that's great advice.  Why didn't I think about that? (note sarcasm)  The problem is that he doesn't really give you a lot of information on how to pick these stocks. The reader who apparently isn't smart enough to know he shouldn't waste money on lottery tickets (one of Tingues suggestions to save money) is somehow suppose to find great stocks that increasingly increase their dividends.  He gives some suggestions, but most of these seem to be advancing Standard and Poor's research and other agendas.<br />Tingue does, however, have one good chapter.  In it he explains the necessity of keeping down your costs.  Once again this is obvious but he gives a pretty lucent description of fees associated with mutual funds and Direct Stock purchase plans.  In the end, you should probably takes Tingues on advice and utilize the library rather than spend money on another investment book you don't need	2004-04-27

Stunningly, his work is a tremedous success of epic proportions.  His basic thesis is that the problems in the Balkans are not a result of the ignorance or war like nature of the Balkan people as many suggest but rather a result of the carelessness of Imperialism and the great powers.  <BR>Glenny's evidence is primarily drawn from the events leading up to and including WWI. Here lies the great strenght of the work.  Glenny gives an in depth and accurate evaluation of the reasons for imperialistic expansion and how these actions affected the Balkan peoples.  The overview of WWII is equally enlightening but not quite as impressive as that of WWI.<BR>The book does have some minor shortcomings when it comes to the communist period.  The chronological that Glenny keeps so nicely in place before beginnigs to break down.  In addition, some areas lack in depth review.  Most notalbly, there is very little of Bulgarian Strongman Todor Zhivkov.  Most disappointing is dearth of information on the Bosinan War of 1992-5 and the war in Kosovo.  It probably goes a little beyond the scope of the work which is primarily a backgroung to this situation.  At 660 pages you cannot complain too much that he decided to end it but it does leave you wanting a little more.<BR>Glenny was a correspondent for the BBC which makes the book a lot more accessible than most of the pedantic works put out by academia.  His writing is entertaining enough with just enough anecdotes to keep the reader focused.  Sometimes he feels the need to share his own personel views, like his opposition to the death penalty. (there is a slight European bias but nothing to be concern the average reader.)  The work is comprehensive and easily the best read you will find on Balkan nationalism in general.	2004-01-05

The fact of the matter is that JK Rowling can write whatever she wants and the muddled masses are all going to buy it and love. But quite simply this book is not half as good as the other four.

Well maybe but there is more to writing then denouement and enveloping structure (not that this book has either.  this book just isn't as fun as the others. It doesn't read like a kid's book. Yes many adultgs read it but I think that is mostly because we like feally like kids again which is what the first four books did.  Plus lets not make the mistake of thinking that adults are really much more intellectual than children.  THis book wasn't bad it was just a little slow.

I was a little disappointed with the movie especially if it keeps people from taking the time to read the book. It is worth the read whether you are a kid or an adult.  It is filled with rich imaginative imagery that was not captured by the movie.  Furthermore, while the whole premise of a little Indian coming alive in a cupboard is engough to keep  the story moving, this is but one of the many adventures twist which unfolds in this great story.

In this one Mary Boyce, the authority on Zoroastrianism and Professor emeritus at the University of London gives us some basic sources.  Anyone studying Zoroastrianism knows that new editions of the primary sources dont come out very often.  This book contains only selections of the Avesta, Vendidad and other works unfortunately.

Zoroastrian fire temples being the most notable exception. a pure joy to read.<br />Nibley does not go into depth concerning mormon temple ceremonies but many of the things he discuss will still be easily understood by the non-mormon reader.

Why would Jains fast and starve themselves when they believe that the beings they worship are not only unaware of their existence but also can in no way help them even if they wanted?  It is a fascinating book that explores this as well as ritual in jain culture. It is based mostly on the authors work in India.  It is quite descriptive and can be understood by all as he expains many aspects of Jainist thought.  <br />In addition to describing the various rituals in play, the author also gives a very thorough explanation of the dieties and their roles.  Furthermore, he effectively compares Jainism with Hinduism and Buddhism making the distinction much clearer. This is a difficult task when dealing with Indian religions.

In this sense God is a verb unlike us who are in one place at one time.  Trust me he explains it much more lucidly.  Furthermore, he does an incredible job in describing a way in which you can experiment with the Kabbalah.  This comprises the third part of the book and is completely seperate if you don't wish to read it.  Before this he delivers with a simple easy to understand description of Kabbalah. (no small feat considering the enormous complexity of the situation.)  A good read for any interested in the subject.	2002-12-01

So if you are attending Harvard and planning on studying Mazdaism this is a great book to read. It is filled with many of the brilliant insights of Jean Kellens and is a great read for serious students of religion.  However, if you are not that familiar with Mazdaism I suggest you start with another work probably Nigosian.  This book also talks considerable about the textual analysis of the Avesta from a linguistical perspective which makes it difficult to follow if you don't have some knowledge of linguistics.	2002-12-01

Furthermore, the explanations of the grammer are weak at best.  This book is more of a workbook that a text.  This of course does you no good unless you have a teacher who knows the answers.

It touches on everything from sexual corruption to radical doctrinal innovations.  The Burned-Over district saw the beginning of numerous religious movements such as Mormonism, Adventism, Christian Scientists, numerous smaller religions that did not survive, and even significant political movements such as Antimasonry.  <br />This book is the story of one of those movements.  The prologue introduces Matthias as he went to Kirtland to visit with the Mormon Prophet, Joseph Smith.  While this event occurred near the end of Matthias&#8217; activity, it is obvious that he stole many of his ideas from Joseph Smith.  Matthias initiated the practice of the washing of feet which was common to both the followers of Joseph Smith and Ellen White.  He also believed that the truth of the Gospel had fallen from the earth shortly after the time of Christ another Mormon belief.  In addition, he had a sword which he claimed was ancient similar to Smith&#8217;s sword of Laban, as well as naming the Priesthood after the order of Melchezidek. Likewise, his early mentor Mordecai Noah taught that the Indians were actually a branch of the Israelites which is a central idea found in the Book of Mormon. All of these ideas came out before 1830 when Matthias began his activity.  <br />The most humorous part of this history is the anecdotes that relate to Matthias&#8217; enemies trying to shave off his beard.  Johnson has done an excellent job condensing all the most relevant information in this short work.  The Kingdom of Matthias is an enjoyable read and a must for anyone interested in this interesting period in American religious history.	2002-01-26

Disturbingly, these scenes only make the book that much more interesting and engrossing.  The book is a wonderful novel set in an incredible time period.  One interesting feature is the change in tense from past to present about halfway through the book. The reader can't help but feel the madness that consumes the protagonist as his obsession to find his Uncle's killer leads him on a maddeningly winding trail.  Besides having a great plot line this novel also has the benefit of giving an insight into Kabbalah, a fascinating movement.

This book has recieved much criticism and rightly so for its poor research. Gross never visited Jedwabne or conducted the interviews. In addition, their are very few sources but Gross trys to explain this away with his own personal view of historiography. Furthermore, the book is only 173 pages plus notes. Much of that is not even dedicated to Jedwabne but to other pogroms and what Gross calls &quot;atavistic antisemitism&quot; in Poland.  However, it does bring to light for the first time that not only Nazis but also Poles participated in the killing of Jews and is noteworthy for this reason.	2001-12-30

Originally published in Italy in 1967 one can only wonder how politics affected this work. Ginzburg herself was a devout communist and was later ?rehabilitated? after serving her sentence. What is surprising in this book is not so much the torture and terrible circumstances that Ginzburg suffered both in solitary confinement and the labor camp, but the differences between the prisoners themselves.  After being wrongfully accused, many communists were still fiercely loyal to their party refusing to talk to Mensheviks and even turning in their fellow prisoners for speaking against the great Stalin.  This book is a brilliant insight in both the Gulag and the communist mind set.	2001-11-21

So it goes	This book describes war, as it should be depicted. That soulless horrific unstoppable force that rolls on forever destroying everything in its path. Billy Pilgrim is described as a bee in amber who can do nothing but exist in a world he cannot control (This metaphor can of course be extended the entire human race.)  Vonnegut uses the aliens and Billy Pilgrim's time travel to show the futility of trying to stop war.  The aliens while they know all about war and even the destruction of the universe do nothing to stop it because it is just the way of things. So it goes. This phrase used throughout the book seems to say what difference does it really make we are all going to die anyway.  Also especially interesting is the time travel for instance at one point Billy Pilgrim sees a bombing in reverse order.  He sees the planes take back the bombs and stop the fires, he sees the bombs being disassembled, and finally he sees the raw materials hidden into the mountain where they can't hurt anyone anymore. So it goes. The irony that permeates Billy's experiences is not only dogmatic but also well developed in this classic work of fiction.	2001-10-23

Or wanted to know more about the early Druids, then this book is for you.  This book gives you a fairly comprehensive if somewhat cursorary look at the world of Shannara. Even things in Isle Witch are included but Anthrax is not. It is not quite as in depth as I had hoped but there are many little intersting tidbits that make it worth buying if you are a true Shannara fan. The biggest problem is the organistion is frustrating. The book is divided into the different lands and basically written as a history of these lands. So if you want to know more about Shea you have to read in the Southland portion until you come across it. This is all well and good if you want to read it cover to cover but if you just want to get some refresh your memory on certain characters it is hard to find them if you can't remeber where they were from.  In addition, there is no index and many minor characters aren't even mention. Still it does help the reader to better visualize the world of Shannara and is an all around fun read.	2001-10-10

It is also much more original.  Brooks has manage to capture the magic and demons of epic fantasty not only in modern times but without running across the globe either.

Sure the book is a little short but it is highly engaging from cover to cover.<BR>Brooks also delves a little into the sci-fi world but not too much. So if you are a die hard fantasy fan like me who doesn't really love science fiction don't worry, This is definitely a fanasty in true Brookian style.<br />I especially love the villians in this series. Antrax who guards the old world treasure and my favorite the Isle Witch who is also oh all things an Ohmsford. I was also suprised by the number of deaths in this book (there is alomost noone left to die in the next book).

He tells us that which we don't want to hear (for example the fact that handicapped people aren't as useful to society as &quot;normal&quot; people. His arguments are very logical and well founded. I found the fact that too many people are recieving a college degree a particularly convincing argument. I mean who really needs a college degree to work at a gas station or as a garbage man. Everything about this work oozes elitism right down to the author's name William A Henry III.	2001-08-30

His knowledge on the subject is obviously immense. Half of the 700 pages consists of notes proving he has done his research (Although some scholars most notably William Hamblin a professor at BYU have accused Quinn of falsifying sources) Unfortunately only about half of the 325 pages of written materiel seemed to be devoted to the comparison of mormonism and magical practices. The book adresses three main issues with ideas interweaved throughout the work.<BR>First, Quinn give numerous explanations of how he has arrived to certain conclusions. He gives the reader a crash course in how to be a historian and history should be written according to him. Unfortunately, this is a bit didactic and manipulative as Quinn gives things his own little logical twist to lead the reader to share his conclusion. He also tries and prove some of his points by using probabilities. This is of course a problem because just because something is highly probable doesn't mean it actually occured.<BR>Second, this book is an attack on LDS apologists and historians. His excuse that he is merely responding to their polemic arguments is both pathetic and ridiculous. The fact is that he continually attcks their works throughout. This would be fine if he did so in a scholarly and logically manner. Instead, he has reduced himself to petty namecalling repeatedly calling them polemic and telling them they would understand better if they would simply read his book! Ironically, while he is correct about many of the methods that some Mormons historians use, he himself is guilty of these same methods. For example, he accuses apologists of dismissing evidence as mere coincidence when it doesn't not support their arguments. However, when discussing the marriages of Joseph Smith and how many were preformed on astrologically significant dates the ones that are nothe dismisses as unfitting to the pattern(after hearing his discussion of every Thursday being significant, every first and last day of a zodiac sign, every new moon and every multiple of seven days folowing the new moon,etc one wonders if there are any days that are not significant). He also hurts his argument with a few (though not many) direct attacks on Mormons. For instance, He accuses Mormons of always trying to explain why certain blessings promised in patriartichal and priesthood blessings do not come true. This is unfair because every Mormon knows that these things are promised on the condition that the person remain righteous similar to many blessings in the Bible.]<BR>Finally, the third thing that Quinn discusses is the relationship of magic and Mormonism. This is by far the most interesting and why people are reading this book. There are many similarities and they are quite thouroughly discussed. The subjects range from astrology to magic circles. He also discusses many of the Smith family heirlooms and their magical significance which I found fascinating.<BR>While the book is an excellent source on Mormonism and magic the many other aspects take away from the work as a whole. If you can manage to wade through the dogmatic parts of the work then this is a good book to read. If you get bogged down by such arguments or are easily manipulated or hoodwinked then skip this one.	2001-08-29

While it is true that Pocatello led many raids on wagon trains most notable at Massacre Rock, Madsen says that he was credited with many more raids than he was actually involved in.

The lessons are well laid out and extremely straightforward. Kelley's starts you off with a core set of words that he continues to use throughout the book adding a few more words every lesson but still using the old words. This gives you the benefit of being able to become extremely familier with some important words, it also has the added benefit of allowing the student to focus in on the grammer instead of having to spend all the grammer lessons on trying to translate the meaning of the words you can concentrate on the conjugation and such. The book starts with nouns and adjectives and only after the student has a firm base does he move on to the infinitly more difficult verbs. Hey what did you expect it is Hebrew. One caution, although the book is full of excercises there are no answers. To get the answers you have to buy another book the handbook which accompanies this book. This is somewhat annoying and is the only reason this manual doesn't deserve 5 stars. The exercises are however extremely helpful in practicing and developing language skills.	2001-08-28

Belene is an island located on the Danube where one of the first work camps began. It still functions as a prison today. Lovech was started when 160 men went on hunger strike in Belene. Many of the prisoners were tortured and beaten to death. After death, their bodies were fed to pigs.<br />The horrific first hand accounts contained in this work documents not only the victims but also their families and the directors and guards at the camp (almost all of which are still deny their involvement and none of which have been brought to justice)<br />What is most disturbing is not so much that something similiar to the  Nazi camps occured in Bulgaria but the fact that noone has had to pay for what they did. This book serves notice to the world that not only did atrocities such as this occur after WWII but that they are still occcuring in Vietnam and other places and will continue to occur as long as we allow it.<br />The only real deficiency in this book is that it doesn't have any accounts from any gypsies or Turks who undoubtly recieved worse treatment at the hands of the Bulgarian communist party.  Also many of the accounts were right after the fall of communism. Having personally talked with some former inmates of Belene and Lovech I cannot help to think that many were still scared to speak out and that many equally horrible events remain uncovered. As one inmate put it \\"Even now there are very few people willing to talk about their experiences in the campss.  They're still afraid! I am too. Yes I'm afraid, but my sons are now grown up and can fend for themselves. So why should I be afraid? Because the gun is still loaded in the hands of old men who won't hesitate to fire.  Thus it was and still is in Bulgaria.	2001-08-23

Told from the point of view of Grendel the monster of Beowulf one can't help but laugh at his confusion the first time he sees men kill each other but for some strange reason they don't eat each other. This book does explore human nature to a certain extent but is way too short(only 174 pages double spaced) to explore it in depth. However, it is by no means a bad book and if you have a couple of hours to spare and nothing better to do by all means read it. It is enjoyable enough to hold your attention for a while.	2001-08-21

The book also has a canary funeral, hollywood scandel and is set during the red scare era. Despite all this it is still exceptionally dull.<br />The story is basically told before it has begun. Within the first ten pages the reader knows pretty much everything that is going to happen.  The rest of the book is little more than numerous character sketches. While the characters are remotely interesting you just keep waiting for some kind of plot twist which never materializes.<br />The title is also a little misleading. When I saw it I thought this was going to be a witty humorous political satire told from the point of view of a communist wife. It is none of these things. I didn't laugh or even crack a smile through the entire book.  It is true that it could be called satire but poor satire at best. One cannot help but cheer when the flat one-dimensional characters get exactly what they deserve.  <br />The story is not told from the point of view of Ira's (the communists) wife but from the view of Nathan Zuckerman , young man who idolized Ira. But most of the story is actually told to him by Murray Ira's brother with ocassional tangents on Zuckerman's life which has nothing to do with Ira's story. This is not only distracting but quite annoying.<br />The book also contains some homosexual and heterosexual undertones and a fair amount of profanity including the use of the F word so if that offends you I would not recommend this book. Even if that doesn't offend you I still would not recommend this sleeper of a novel.	2001-08-21

The action sequences in the battle room are very very well written and you feel like you are there a part of it. <br />But if it was only entertaining it would just be another fun science fiction novel. What sets this apart is that it is thought provoking. Ender is a great character who while most of can't really relate to him (I mean he is the smartest brightest kid in the world whose was taken from his parents and forced to enter military school) but most of us can at least feel for his situation.<br />What really makes this book is the astounding ending. It is suprising, truimphant, heart wrenching, horrifying, terrible and thought provoking all at the same time. One of the best endings of all time and the best science fiction book I have ever read.	2001-08-19

For one thing the choice of words leaves much to be desired. For example, you can in the english portion you can find armament but somehow banana is missing. I don't know about you but I use banana I lot more than I use the word armament.  <br />The Bulgarian section isn't any better missing key words such as taka and takiva.  Zero is spelled incorrectly  in the Bulgarian section so that it is pronouces with a p sound instead of the correct n pronuciation. Many of the definition are impercise and would do better as secondary definition. The Bulgarian word given for pen is actually closer to quill is one example.<br />There are some dictionaries which are slightly better, but the truth is that you can't get a good bulgarian dictionary in America, the best are made in Bulgaria.  If you really want to learn Bulgarian (and I can't imagine why you would) then your best bet is to buy a grammer book and just learn the words of the glossary or just wait until you are in Bulgaria to buy a dictionary.	2001-08-01

The first two hundred pages with its explanation of the tribe and the brothers who are the chiefs sons are truly engrossing. Unfortunately it tapers off from there. About the time you hit page 300 the book is basically over. the author however decides to babble for abouta hundred pages or so before he finally ties up some loose ends. Another disappointment is the protagonist, Saban, who starts out likeable enough but ends up being somewhat annoying and weak. His counterparts his wives, his war chief brother and his club footed brother are far more interesting characters. <br />While Cornwell's explanation of Stonehenges purpose is nothing out of the ordinary his description of its possible use is quite interesting.  The best part about the book is the imaginary mythology that Cornwell has created for the tribe and their worship of sundry deity.  For example, in the novel the tribe takes their dead (and there are many) to the death place where they allow the body to be consumed by vultures and other birds.  Students of religion will recognize this as a Zorastrian custom, that began in Iran about 3000 BC. <br />All in all the book is not too bad but on the other hand it really isn't all that good either.	2001-07-06

The problem is that the story is perfect,way to perfect for anyone to really believe. At every point they are faced with a mystery that has baffled scholars for years and every time a solution magically appears. Never once in their investigation do the authors find something they can't solve. By the end of the book the have not only discovered how Freemasonry began but also know the true identity of Hiram Abiff and the origin of the Turin Shroud!! All this without a single note referring to some source!! The book doesn't even have a bibliography.  A little lacking in evidence to make such astounding discoveries don't you think.  In the authors' defense their speculation is at least plausible if lacking in evidence and the book is a highly entertaining read with interesting little bits of information. But be wary, the evidence is sketchy at best.	2001-05-25

I quickly developed what I can only think of now as an obsession and finished the four book saga in week. The first two books were by far the best. I was engrossed by the magnificent idea of a boy forced to become a magician who despite his apprehensions becomes one of the greatest magicians the world(that is the fantasy world) has ever known. The saga is a must for all fantasy fans.<br />I was thirsty for more and so I decided to read Feist's next book Prince of the Blood.  It was horrible.  No it was worse then horrible it was so bad I wanted to burn it (for those of you who are appalled and rightly so fear not the feeling only lasted for a short time I would of course never actually burn a book no matter how bad it was)<br />A month later I decided Magician was good enough that I would give Feist another try despite Prince of the Blood, so I purchased The King's Buccaneer. I loved It. I couldn't put it down. I feigned sickness so I could stay home and read.  If you are a fantasy fan you have to read this book and if you are not a fantasy fan read this book anyway.<br />While it is not quite as good as Magician it is close. So read the Riftwar Saga and love it. Then skip the Prince of Blood and don't give it a second thought not even for a milisecond. But whatever you do don't miss this great adventure.	2001-05-18

I am a huge Dicken's fan and was looking forward to getting an easy A on a book I had already read twice. <br />Then she said that we were reading the book not because it was particularly good but because it was written by a black woman and the AP test often asked questions about women or black authors. I was raging. In fact, I don't think I have ever been that mad in my entire life. I hate political correctness. But this is not a political discussion it is a book review.<br />If you haven't guessed when I started reading this book I was less than excited.  Luckily, I was pleasently suprised. The book is not bad in fact it is really good. The ending ALMOST made me cry (in case you were wondering I never cry, not even at my Grnadpa's funeral) You can't help but feel for the charachter's plight in this story and the ending is astounding. It is one of those books that just leaves you sitting their saying wow. <br />This is one of those books that you keep thinking about for days after you finished it.

Unfortunately the translation I read was very difficult to understand and I had problems trying to match characters with pronouns among other things. This translation has no such problems. It is very readable. The readability of the text obviously enhances the experience since one can concentrate on the content and not on the difficult language. Another nice feature is the inclusion of the original text. While I can not read it, it is certainly very interesting to compare.<br />The actually epic of Beowulf is a great knights tale that has been revived as a result of Tolkein's interest in the work. In my opinion it is the greatest epic ever written. While it is much shorter than say the Iliad, I certainly found it more entertaining. Beowulf's adventure's with Grendal and his mother(thank goodness none of our mother-in-laws were like this) can not be beat. Don't miss this enchanting tell.<br />I also highly recommend this book on tape read by Heaney. His Irish accent gives the story a dark ages feeling that really enhances the experience.	2001-05-10

It reads as both a sort of novel and a work of academic history. I would say it is a historical narrative but it is more than that combining both forms in seperate sections of the story and then blending them all together.<br />Another nice touch is the author's use of a quote from the Oxford English Dictionary at the beginning of each chapter. Don't be decieved by the short length of the book, you will need a dictionary to learn all of these words and it has some great ones(some weren't even in my dictionary) But hey if you are going to read a book about lexiography you should use a dictionary right.	2001-05-10

Well, Bellamy is no Huxley. This book is dry and unimaginative. The author's view of the year 2000 is almost comical. In over a hundred years(the book was written in something like 1887) the only change is that all of humanity has learned to work together. The funny thing is that is all this time the mode of dress has stayed the same. So somehow man has changed his entire inherently selfish nature but hasn't been able to come up with a better shoe style in a hundred years. Give me a break. If you are looking for a thought provoking look at the future I suggest Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. As for Bellamy's Looking Backwards, leave it on the shelf.	2001-05-03

First of all this book is not cliche or a rehash of earlier material as other reviewers have stated. This book is also not very good. The book is written by John Bennett the first mayor of Nauvoo and one of the first major opponents of the Mormon movement. It is one of the first works of anti-mormon literature. I give it a five not because of any inherent academic achievement by Bennett (it has none the book was little more than a money making scheme and a political tool) but because of what we can learn about early mormon dissenters and their views of Mormonism. It also has great significance as a first hand account, albeit a biased one but all views of Mormonism are obviously biased one way or the other.	2001-05-03
