In this one, I think, Mahfouz mastered this new writing disciplin of his. Now he knows what he wants to do and what to say, and he pretty much did a good job.    This story, I feel, combines elements from this and the previous phases (The privious phase was the one ending with the Trilogy). It is a romance, and is a deep study of the psychology of Egyptians.    The story starts with a prostitute/pimp mother revealing to her son that his father was still alife and is a wealthy man. Then she dies. The boy starts \\"The Search\\" for his father, which is the title of the novel. The real Arabic title was \\"The Road.\\" The story from this point on takes a different turn. You would think that the story is only conserned with the search for the father. I think what Mahfouz wants is the search for the identity.    I think this is a story of how a man can be both a villain and a magnanimous. How a man can both enjoy a platonic love and indulge in an animalistic sexual relationship in the same time.    Mahfouz does a great job describing the feelings of a suspicious man, and how this might lead him to a point from where he cannot return. How a man can hate the same person he used to love, or on whom his life depended.    The story is worth reading, and is one of the best I read. If you already like it, why don't you try \\"Midaq Alley\\" and \\"The Trilogy.\\" For more reviews about Mahfouz's books, please strike the blue \\"a_mathematician\\" below the title of this review, and enjoy.	2003-05-19

We, the children of this new age, are deprived of major classics and beautiful mathematics because of the tediousness of the notation. Oh, do not be optimistic, this is not the only book with forbidding notation, see Artin's Galois theory, which is an excellent book if someone just tries to update its notation.<br />Aside from that the book was a merry one. It contains more books than the first one. It contains the books 3 up to 9 of Euclid's 13 books of the elements.<br />Book 3 is a delightful one. Its sole purpose is to characterize circles. It goes with the same style of the first two books given the first volume. Books 4 continues in the same fashion and studies circumscribing and inscribing figures by others.<br />Book 5 is the first attempt to bring geometry near to algebra. It deals with proportions. The notation started getting more and more cumbersome. He continues giving us things that we know already. And all through the volume until book 9 we see results commonly given in simple college algebra in the most tedious fashion.<br />I praise this volume only for the material on circles and I see that it is worth reading if you have a strong constitution. As for me I am not going to read the third one about the out of date commensurable numbers.	2003-05-01

Well, you must know before reading this book that mathematicians were never great historians. Dr Beckmann is a professor of Electrical Engineering and this is more in the Physics side. This makes him potentially worse of a historian. But then would you please stop for a second and tell me what you want to know in a book about &quot;Pi!&quot;<br />I know I want to know almost anything there is about it. I want to know its origin, how people dealt with it in ancient days, and how people are dealing with it nowadays or in the past 100 year. Do not be mystified, for this number was known long long ago.<br />Then what is wrong with digressions? We want to know as much as possible, don't we? I saw that Dr Beckmann insights were all interesting. You would say, &quot;Oh, yeah, another one of those geeky mathematicians.&quot; But I would only answer that I hate computers but read the section about applying the computer in computing new digits of this strange number.<br />This number appears in so many places in mathematics. The most famous is in the formula relating the circumference of the circle to the radius. And it appears in so many other sciences. It was the passion of so many amateur mathematicians to compete in the memorization of as many as a million digits after the decimal point.<br />Do you see why I decided to read the book? It is worth your time. Read it you too.	2003-05-01

But that does not make it excellent	I am pretty much interested in geometry. I am, in fact, enthusiastic, and enthusiastic people usually do have strange habits regarding their subjects of enthusiasm. I, for one, like to buy all of the geometry books I can lay my hand on regardless of its relevance to my studies or usefulness for reading.<br />And this book, being a classic, was on top of my demanded books list until I bought it around 1998. As usual with these books, I postponed its reading until the new millennium. But when I read it I was very disappointed.<br />The material of this book is one of the most beautiful afforded by a mathematics book. It is very interesting, but, alas, it is written in a forbidding notation. I can understand high level math books in Algebra and Analysis, but this book confused me with words. Frankly, I do not see why a math book is supposed to explained in words after all this development of mathematics.<br />Unfortunately, most historian mathematicians disagree with my view. They see that writing the elements of Euclid (The first rigorous set of axioms and lemmas) in the modern notation is unfaithful to the original manuscript. Well, I have got no problem with that, but at least try to make it up to date so that people could go through it.<br />You see that I gave it 4 stars. Yes the material of the book was excellent, and it rather deserved 5 stars, but for this tedious presentation.<br />One other thing I hated a bout this volume was the introduction. It had taken about one third of the book, and after the definitions of the first book, there are notes on the definitions and postulates that take another third of the book. These notes are not all that easy and at a higher level than the postulates of Euclid, and I found them irrelevant. I do not understand here why did not the author, who made notes on the definitions, make a section explaining all the postulates in modern notation.<br />As for the material, the volume covers Books I and II of Euclid's 13 books of the elements. The first book introduces a set of definitions and goes on characterizing triangles. It, even, proves the Pythagorean theorem. This proof was a bit difficult, a simpler proof can be found else where, but, after all, it is amazing how mathematicians could have solved such a problem thousands of years ago.<br />He introduced the famous constructions of straight edge and a compass, he would construct an isosceles triangle starting from a given segment by merely using a straight edge and a compass. Later on, Galois studied this construction in his famous Galois theory (try Artin's Galois theory, although I do not guarantee it).<br />The second books deals with areas of triangles and rectangles, and Euclid's notation shows it incompetence when he uses the same name for two different things. For in the first book he used to say that two triangles are equal if all their angles and sides are equal, but in the second book he would define two triangles to be equal if they had the same area!<br />All in all, I enjoyed the book, and would have enjoyed it more if not for the drawbacks.	2003-05-01

(for a review of that book click on the blue &quot;a_mathematician&quot; above to see it in its proper place). As Pi is closely associated with the circle, then so is e associated to logarithms and differential equations. It is even called the natural base!<br />Maor does an excellent job in accounting the historical points about e. In the beginning of the book we see e associated with the logarithms and then we see its characterization as the limit of some sequence of numbers. Then we go into some summary of the origin of calculus to see that the exponential function with base e is its own derivative.<br />If you find all this difficult to grasp right now, do not worry, because it is explained in the book in simple language.<br />The book then goes into spirals, and then to hyperbolic trig functions which are defined in terms of the exponential functions base e, and the book is concluded with the Euler's equation, the equation containing the four most important numbers in mathematics: Pi, e, 1, and zero.<br />I can't emphasize this enough, but the language of the book is understandable by anyone. Maybe you would be convinced if I tell you that my native language is not English, yet I could understand the insights of the writer. If you liked the book try a better one, Singh's &quot;Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem.&quot; (For a review please click on the blue a_mathematician above)	2003-05-01

I might argue that this is not the best subject for such a course, yet this is very irrelevant here.<br />All through the class I struggled to understand concepts. I did not. That was not due to the book since I did not even bother opening it. After finishing the course, I realized that the material of this book is of the most importance to anyone planning on continuing his/her grad degree in math, so I decided to read the book. The mission was accomplished in a matter of a couple of weeks.<br />I do not claim that this is the easiest book to understand the material. In fact, Lang's books are remarked for their dryness. Motivation is almost nonextant. If you, however, have a fairly good background in Linear Algebra (something like the material of Anton's \\"Elementary Linear Algebra\\" or the like) and Abstract Algebra (an excellent introduction can be sought in Herstein's \\"Abstract Algebra\\") you would much benefit from this book.<br />The book is a very good book for a second course in linear algebra, that is, it is not a good book for those who had no experience with matrix theory before. The reason is that the book does not mention anything about Gaussian elimination and treats the solutions of n equations in m unknowns using dimension theorems, which is not the standard way of proving existence of such solutions. One more thing is that it does not talk about elementary matrices (one can interpret column or row operations by multiplication of elementary matrices to the right or left). I am not saying the book <BR>is bad, I am saying it is not the right book for a beginner.<br />The book introduces the basic notions of vector spaces, linear mappings, matrices scalar products, determinants, and eigenvalues and spaces. It then moves to unitary, symmetric, and Hermitian operators and explores their Eigenvalues. Polynomials have a whole chapterfollowed by triangulation of a linear map. The book concludes with applications of Linear algebra to convex geometry.<br />I might disagree with the definition of the determinant the author offers, but I would have to admit that his approach is the traditional one.<br />The subjects of the books must be mastered (or at least absorbed) by anyone who wants to go to analysis (Functional analysis to be precise), Algebra, Geometry, and Differential Equations. To ensure this you should do almost all the exercises of the book since they are so excellent and help a lot in understanding the material presented.	2003-04-25

He, as a matter of fact, appears in about half of it and the other half is a background of the crime; I hope I am not spoiling the story. <br />It is obvious through out the story that Doyle was really affected by both Poe and Gabourio. The affection of the former is obvious through Dupin his sleuth who stared in three short stories that might be the first stories ever about unofficial detectives; and the latter through Lecoq the french detective who stared in 5 novels, and it is known that Gabourio was the one to lay the bases of modern mysteries. <br />I really recommend the novel for those of you who love mysteries, and I have to say that it is not a whodunit; it is more of a deductive account of how Sherlock Holmes found his way to the villain.	2003-04-25

He was successful in his job, was about to marry the woman of his dreams, and was in the verge of being a first class citizen. Things change, however, and he becomes jobless. He takes a big vacation to Alexandria and so many things take place from there on.<br />Here, Mahfouz, who got used to writing in this new style, explores all possible things occurring to this man, and he even makes him suffer in war. He uses his simple sophisticated language to explain all the events.<br />The ending was a bit shaky to my taste. There was, in fact, no ending, for all I care. It is one of those \\"and life goes on\\" where you do not know what comes of the heroes.<br />All in all, the book is worth reading, it might even give you some delightful time, but still I like the old Mahfouz's style.	2003-04-24

I generally don't give that many 5-stars, but in this case I can't help it.<br />The story is about a rabid dog. He was not rabid from the beginning of the story. He got rabies from some bats. The dog starts biting people, starting from its owner ... not that interesting, eh?<br />This was not what I liked. What I liked was the so many characters King had devised in the story.<br />The story starts with a serial killer becoming a spirit and haunting the cupboard of a young boy. As usual his parents do not believe what he says. The father is a commercial designer and the mother is a simple housewife. The dog was owned by a different family. And at the end there was a big encounter between the mother and her child and the dog. It was marvelous.<br />Kings style is so simple that even I can understand it. He goes along the story with his simple everyday terms, and knows when to introduce which character. He knows when to stop and when to continue, and you never get bored. This story was the one that hooked me on King's writings.<br />It remains to say that this story is not your common ghost horror stories, it is more realistic than that, yet is still breathtaking. If you never read any Kings stories and plan on starting pick this one first. If you have already read \\"The Shining,\\" \\"The Stand,\\" \\"Carrie,\\" or \\"The Dead Zone\\" you would like this one, because it is plainly better than those.	2003-04-24

Then he started writing this strange novel. It is nothing like any of his old novels. It is, in fact, the beginning of a new direction in his writing.<br />There were many directions in Mahfouz's writing. He started first with short stories, then moved to historical novels, and then settled with usual romances. And here, in the beginning of this new direction, he starts writing pointless stories. I do not mean in the bad sence, what I really mean is a story beginning in a certain setting, with rich characters, but with the strangest ending. It might not be the worst of his writing but I just do not like open or not consistent endings. And by no means, does that mean that the novel is bad<br />I, as a matter of fact, liked it. I even enjoyed, it is the style that I could not comprehend completely. 3 stars with Mahfouz mean 5 stars with other. When I give it 3 stars I mean it was very good, but I cannot give it 5 stars because in this case I would say it was as good as \\"The Trilogy,\\" which is not the case.<br />In this story we see a prisoner getting out of jail full of revenge ideas. His wife betrays him, his daughter no longer recognizes him, and he has only three refuges are: a corrupted friend of his who is working as a journalist, a religious old man his father used to visit frequently, and a wretched girl he used to know before his imprisonment.<br />Then Mahfouz continues developing this character, with all the feelings and mishaps.<br />The story was, I cannot emphasize enough, interesting and enlightening, yet not my type. You might want to give it a try, but I recommend \\"The Trilogy\\" for starters.	2003-04-24

It is an absolute classic, and it is a petty you can't find it in English. After that one, he attempted writing the story before you, \\"A Beginning and An End\\" would have been a better translation of the name.<br />Here I did not like the plot that much. The novel starts with a family, Hasan, Husain (means a small Hasan in Arabic), Hasanain (means 2 Hasans), and their mother, sister and father. They were a well-to-do family, but the father died exposing his family to poverty.<br />Hasan is a reckless wretch, who could not do well in school, and so he forsook his family for a job as a bully for his girlfriend of a belly dancer. The sister, who thought herself ugly, started fooling around with perverts and turned to a prostitute in disguise. Husain graduated from his high school and choose to work in order to help his family.<br />Now we come to Hasanain, the conceited brother. The whole story is a description of his arrogance and how he burdened his family.<br />If you think I have spoiled the story, then you have made a big mistake, there still are so many details you don't know, and I encourage you to read the book. I did not like it because I read better novels by Mahfouz, and I quite frankly find it to be one of the worst he wrote. Yet you might like it if it was your first reading. What remains here is to say that \\"Midaq Alley\\" and \\"The Trilogy\\" are by far much better works than this.	2003-04-24

This man, being one of the best (if not the best) Arabic novelists, is not really well appreciated in the West. I am not trying to imply anything here. It just so happens that Maxim Gorky, the greatest Russian Novelist, is also ignored. You cannot, for example, find the complete collection of his short stories translated to English, which really deprives so many readers from his capturing style.<br />When you view the ratings the readers had given to Mahfouz's works, you would find that they have really enjoyed his singular style. It is unique, as a matter of fact. He was actually affected by the Western and Russian giants in his writing style.<br />This story \\"Midaq Alley,\\" with midaq meaning an object being hit, just like an anvil, was written after 6 other literary works. The first one was a collection of fine short stories, and for a starter in literature, I might say they have some elements of genius. Then he went to write three historical novels, evidently affected by Sir Walter Scott, situated in old Egypt. I did not like those three, even though the language (in Arabic) was excellent. Then he started his real career with \\"The New Cairo,\\" which is the name of a quarter in Cairo, followed by \\"Khan Al-Khalili,\\" both being excellent reads.<br />I was disappointed, thus, by seeing this story. It is not all that bad, but I did not see the use of much of the occurrences and the plot could have been reduced to a short story. Do not take me wrong, I enjoyed it after all, but when I compare it to \\"The New Cairo\\" and the \\"Khan Al-Khalili\\" I cannot but give it 3 stars.<br />The story speaks about the life styles of people living in a popular quarter called \\"Al-Midaq Alley,\\" which is a little bigger than an alley itself. So many characters appear in the plot, and Mahfouz has done a great job describing their lives and feelings. The story is actually centered about a girl who is about to leave the alley and start a business in \\"prostitution.\\" She has a lover, and the story is mainly accounting the suffering of her negligence of him and her suffering from poverty.<br />Mahfouz is a popular writer and would always give you the truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth. He describes in this novel the true feelings of a boys loving café master, an old spinster trying to hunt a husband, and a beggar providing a dentist with golden teeth.<br />If you want to know something about Egypt of the 1940's (like I did), you are more than welcome to read this novel, which, I guarantee, will not bore you.	2003-04-24

I would answer: because math appeals to a large number of people, and, you got to admit it, in this period of time people must know something about it. This theorem, in addition, had puzzled great mathematicians (even geniuses) for more than three and a half century.<br />The book starts with some exploration of Greek mathematics, being the base of modern mathematics. Here we must see something about the Pythagorean Theorem, because it inspired the Fermat's Last theorem.<br />He moves then to speak about Fermat, the French mathematician. He mentions that Fermat did not in fact write a proof for his theorem due to the limitation of the margins of his copy of Diaphintine's &quot;Arithmetica,&quot; and this caused the whole mathematical community to suffer 385 years to construct a plausible proof.<br />After that, we see how Euler proved the case when n = 3. Then Sophie Germain prove it, inspired by Euler, for the Germain prime numbers. This eliminated most of the cases, yet there still infinitely many cases to check. The book does not go into technicalities, but you can enjoy reading about the backgrounds of some of brightest mathematicians of the 19th century.<br />Then comes some account on cryptography, as being the direct application to Number Theory, followed by the story of how Andrew Wiles, the most famous mathematician of our time, came to prove this theorem.<br />It proved to be even a harder task. It involved some modern up-to-date mathematics, some fields of Number Theory called: &quot;Elleptic Curves&quot; and &quot;Modular Forms.&quot;<br />And to conclude I would like to say that I think any person with some understanding of the notion of mathematics may be very able to enjoy it as much as I did. If you want an introduction to this &quot;mysterious&quot; discipline, this book would provide you the best read.	2003-04-23

The probability of hating all the works of one certain writer is so small that it is negligible. So when I bought this book I knew deep in my mind that I would at least like about a hundred pages of the book. I did not. I enjoyed all the book except for possibly 40-50 pages which is more than impressive.<br />When I say I like all of the book, I mean to say all of the prose section. I hate poetry, sorry for that but I cannot help it. This review here is concerned with the prose section.<br />The book begins with the only novel Poe wrote, namely \\"Narrative of A Gordon Pym.\\" (For a complete review of the novel, please click on the blue \\"a_mathematician\\" to view it in the proper place). The novel takes one fifth of the prose section, and is followed by a subsection called \\"Tales of Deduction.\\"<br />The first short story of that section is \\"The Gold Bug,\\" an interesting story. As a matter of fact, Doyle based \\"The adventure of the Dancing Men,\\" a Sherlock Holmes's short story, on it. Then it goes into introducing Dupin the French, the first unofficial detective ever. (For a complete review of the novel please click on the blue \\"a_mathematician\\" to view it in the proper place).<br />Then comes \\"Tales of Horror,\\" and, oh my, this part is the most wonderful of the whole collection. Even though Poe was the first to write in this genre, there still no one superior to him. I am not sure about HP Lovecraft, but I am sure King is not up to him. Poe can bring the chill to your heart. I heard he used to eat much on dinner just to bring nightmares to his night sleep, and when he wakes up in the morning he would record every single detail of his dreams to use it in his short stories.<br />The stories I prefer are: \\"The Black Cat,\\" which ruined the life of a very wretched man; \\"The Pit and the Pendulum,\\" which speaks about the pains of one prisoner of the Spanish Inquisition; \\"The Masque of the Red Death,\\" whose story I wouldnot have actually liked if not for the marvelous description, Poe provides, for every single bit of occurrence. \\"The Fall of the House of Usher,\\" which speaks about the life of a very singular person and his sister (This one is considered by many to be the best short story Poe has every written); and \\"The Oblong Box,\\" which is exactly what Doyle would have written had he got the idea first.<br />Then comes \\"Tales of Imagination.\\" This section was the one I did not like that much. He started with a few very descriptive emotional stories (I would only consider them nonsensical, no offense).<br />The stories I liked here were: \\"Manuscript Found in A Bottle,\\" which is a pretty funny story about someone being in a foreign ship without people feeling his presence; and \\"The Unparalleled Adventures of One Hans Pfall,\\" which explores the reasons behind Pfall's wanting to forsake the earth for the moon on his balloon. The latter is more of a novella than a short story.<br />The next section is \\"Satirical Tales and Hoaxes.\\" This was the second best section I enjoyed. The best stories were: \\"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether,\\" which is an insane story, no one could have ever produced such a comedy before; \\"Some Words with A Mummy,\\" and for those of you who are familiar with the Egyptian novelist Naguib (or Najib) Mahfouz, I may tell you that he had used a similar idea in his first collection of short stories; \\"The Man that was Used Up,\\" which I can describe with no other word than ABSOLUTELY FUNNY with a very twisted end; \\"Loss of Breath,\\" is another example for the genius of Poe; \\"Never Bet the Devil Your Head,\\" HaHa; \\"The Spectacles,\\" I read this one so long ago and it still possessed its charm with its funny twisted conclusion; \\"The Literary Life of Thingum Bob, Esq,\\" which was a satirical and wonderful one; and finally \\"X-ing A Paragraph,\\" which was the best one in the section.<br />Then come some articles, the best of which were 'Didling' and 'Maelzel's ChessPlayer.' They were nice to read despite their being out of date.<br />In the end I would like to apologize for this long review, but you cannot describe - or better yet, review - about a thousand pages in a two liner. I like the book and there is no reason you should not. Poe has affected so many writers, some of whom are: RL Stevenson, AC Doyle, Roald Dahl, HP Lovecraft, Steven King, and so many others, so if you read for any of those you would definitely enjoy this book.	2003-04-23

The author speaks about a nice incident about a Pythagorean being killed for believing that there existed some numbers other than the Rationals (They were called Irrarionals later, even though they are as rational to the modern mathematics as any other numbers, say the quaternions).<br />He moves then to speak about Fermat, the French mathematician. He mentions that Fermat did not in fact write a proof for his theorem due to the limitation of the margins of his copy of Diaphintine's \\"Arithmetica,\\"! this caused the whole mathematical community to suffer 385 years to construct a plausible proof.<br />After that, we see how Euler proved the case when n = 3. Then Sophie Germain prove it, inspired by Euler, for the Germain prime numbers (which are some special prime numbers). This eliminated most of the cases, yet there still are infinitely many cases to check. The book does not go into technicalities, but you can enjoy reading about the backgrounds of some of brightest mathematicians of the 19th century.<br />Then comes some account on cryptography, as being the direct application of Number Theory, followed by the story of how Andrew Wiles, the most famous mathematician of our time, came to prove this theorem.<br />It proved to be even a harder task. It involved some modern up-to-date mathematics ... some fields of Number Theory called: \\"Elleptic Curves\\" and \\"Modular Forms.\\"<br />Finally, I would like to say that I read this book when I was at my junior year in the department of mathematics at the University of Missouri-Columbia, I DID NOT NEED MUCH MATH TO UNDERSTAND IT. It, as a matter of fact, inspired me to continue my grad studies in the subject of Number Theory; unfortunately my real mathematical interests won the quarrel and I had to settle with Geometry.<br />I think any person with some understanding of the notion of mathematics may be very able to enjoy it as much as I did. If you want an introduction to this \\"mysterious\\" discipline, this book would provide you the best read.	2003-04-20

It is one of the best adventure novels I have ever read.<br />It speaks about an adventure seeker, a Mr. A. Gordon Pym. He tries to leave the luxury of his little city Nantucket, where he used to live with his father. One friend of his convinces him to travel. The first voyage was a total disaster. But he did not quit his dream. He went on yet another ... Man, it was the most chilling experience I ever had. It is not like anything you dream, it is even stranger. No goblins nor trolls appear hear, yet still, Poe can really bring the horror to your heart.<br />A mutiny is added to the singular experience Pym had, and then Cannibalism. And after you thought the story finished, you see that Poe starts a new story which not as impressive as the first, yet turns the attention to some other direction.<br />The end was a bit shaky. I did not like it at all. I usually do not like open endings. That was the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.<br />Overall, I would recommend you to read it in the middle of the night (if you do not have anything else to do), with a cup of tea, and with no one else around! You would enjoy it even more.	2003-04-19

Similar thing is seen in Doyle's Holmes, for Doyle asserts that Moriarty, the arch enemy of Sherlock Holmes, is in fact a mathematician.<br />Well aside from that he places much importance on meditation, a habit that is very unfamiliar in most of the world.<br />In the course of the first story, \\"The Murders of Rue Morgue,\\" the French detective, Dupin, surprises his companion by interfering in his thoughts, an act that was criticized by Holmes in the novel \\"A Study in Scarlet,\\" and that was practiced by him in some other short story of his.<br />The mystery, on the other hand, was a new one, not a simple one, and the deductions of Dupin were very logical and intriguing.<br />In the second story, \\"The Mystery of Marie Roget,\\" Poe reconstructs a real crime by merely building up from the newspaper clips he collected over the span of time. He finally solves the mystery in the person of his detective Dupin. Close analysis had showed that the answer provided by Poe was actually the right one.<br />In the third story, \\"The Purloined Letter,\\" Dupin solves a very easy mystery that puzzled the police force of paris.<br />This book is not at the same level of Doyle's writing, it is a little simpler, but is a nice read, though. That might be true because Doyle had based his detective, Holmes, on Dupin, and had actually attained the fame that forced him to dedicate some of his time for his mysteries.	2003-04-19

Watson, M.D.	Books	3	6	13	N	N	Better Than the "Seven-Per-Cent Solution"	I was reluctant to read this one after the \\"Seven-Percent Solution,\\" but Mr. Meyer disappointed me by writing a much better story.<br />This story appeared first in Play Boy, and the book is a longer revision of that one.<br />The story is about Murders that haunted the west end. Of course Sherlock Holmes cannot hold back when there are murders nearby.<br />The good thing about the book is that Mr. Meyer does not claim that any of the manuscripts provided by Doyle were forgeries. The bad thing is that he still uses real characters, like Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, and Bram Stoker, which I still say is dumb.<br />One other thing I hate about these pastiches is that they insist on saying that Watson was a real person, and that he used to publish his work under the pseudonym Conan Doyle, or else that Conan Doyle was the agent under whose name Watson used to publish works. I realize that this is one way to make things continue, but come on, we all know that we are only fooling ourselves.<br />Anyhow, I think the book might deserve 4 stars if not for the little drawbacks I mentioned above, and I am sure you are going to enjoy it, but try first to get it from the library, just in case you detested it.	2003-04-11

Watson, M.D. (Norton Paperback)	Books	1	13	36	N	N	Mr. Meyer, Please Don't Write Any More Holmes's Stories	This was the first novel I read that wasn't the writing of Sir Doyle, and, quite frankly, it was the worst. Meyer doesn't seem to be familiar with the Holmes's world. His Holmes is a weak hearted one; he is hooked on Cocaine. Yea, sure, Doyle's Holmes was hooked on Cocaine (that is what is meant by the seven-per-cent solution), but he never showed it as a weak point.<br />Doyle's Holmes was able to take Cocaine whenever he wanted, and could easily quit it whenever he pleased, and, surprisingly, his addiction to Cocaine was only mentioned in the \\"sign of four,\\" so I don't really approve of Meyer's usage of it, and I do not really accept Holmes as a meager guy.<br />Then, Meyer says, out of the blues, that \\"The Final Problem\\" was a forgery that Watson needed to assert in order to hide more interesting occurrences. What was the occurrences? It was trying to get Holmes out of the habit of using Cocaine ... Pshaw!<br />He also claims that Moriarty was Holmes's math tutor, that Holmes's mother left his father, and that was why he hated women. He even describes Moriarty as a peace loving man, and that Holmes was blinded by Cocaine when he claimed that Moriarty was a villain.<br />For Meyer to say that one of the stories written by Doyle is a forgery is a big mistake. Would any one of you say that the best Holmes's stories ever written, were written by anyone other than Doyle? This is ridiculous.<br />One other aspect I hated about this story was that it inserts real existing people to the plot, like Freud! Aside from being dumb, this is really uninteresting. This makes the book a study of human thinking, not a mystery, which is the real essence of the Holmes's stories.<br />Of course you figured out that Freud was supposed to be the one to make Holmes quit Cocaine ... I can say only one thing, \\"DUMB.\\"<br />Near the end Meyer stoops to give us some mystery, sorry not a mystery but some wannabe thriller. It ends in a man hunt looking mostly like the one presented by Doyle inthe \\"Sign of Four,\\" but on board of a train. I did not like it either.<br />At the end, Holmes saves Vienna and then returns back home having had the silliest adventure in his carrier. And I am selling this book before I tear it into pieces.	2003-04-11

After reading the disasters that Meyer claims to be the further adventures of Sherlock Holmes's (\\"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\\" and \\"The West End Horror\\"), I thought that Millett would provide a better treatment of the Holmes's world. He DID NOT.<br />I had to suffer reading this book, which is not a mystery (just like the horrible \\"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\\"), there was not real interesting way to reach the villain.<br />It begins in London, where Holmes was invited by a rich American to Minnesota. This is the first author I read for who brings Holmes to America. That is not bad. Changing the British spelling into American was not bad either. The plot was.<br />If you have read the Doyle's version of Holmes you would not like this new version. Here Holmes did not appear to be so intelligent. Watson was as dumb as ever.<br />After reaching Minnesota, Holmes starts his investigation which leads him to a whore house, and there a strange episode occurs to Watson with two twin prostitutes. I did not like it.<br />In my opinion, Millett's style had ruined Holmes.<br />In the end a big fire takes place, and Holmes helps people ... as if he is a fire fighter.

Some people say he was jealous that the character he made up was more famous than he was, and he claimed that he wanted to concentrate on more \\"serious\\" writings.<br />By the year 1902, people have boycotted all the writings of Doyle, and they even quit going to his clinic for counsels. He was about to declare his bankruptcy. And he was trying to write a story about a myth of an enormous dog haunting the life of people in some area of Britain. He wrote the story with some new characters, but finally found that writing it with Holmes as the hero would make much better, and it would be easier than making up some new environment for the characters. People were happy, but the problem was that the story takes place in a time interval before his acclaimed death in the \\"Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes.\\"<br />He, then, is forced to resurrect Sherlock Holmes in the \\"Return of Sherlock Holmes,\\" at the year 1905, which is a collection of 10 short stories. He, then, stops writing Holmes's stories, without killing Holmes, which was a clever move. But then people were at a rage and wanted some Holmes's adventures, and Doyle had to write something, but this was not any earlier than 1914, in \\"The Valley of Fear,\\" 9 years after his last appearance.<br />In this book, he uses almost exactly the same method of writing he used in his first book, \\"A Study in Scarlet.\\" That is, he cut the story into two parts, the first one featuring Holmes, and the second one does not mention Holmes at all accept at the very end of it. People did not like that because Holmes only appears at half of the story.<br />And let me tell you, that the first half, which features Holmes, was not all that insightful. It was not all that clever. It was the second part that appealed to me. It was a very nice plot. And, as a matter of fact, it explained the story of the villain in the first part. There was a twist at the end, and I am sure that Mme. Christie had used it in one of her detective, Poirot's, major mysteries. I am not going to mention it, since it is going to spoil the plot of both mysteries. If you really need to know it, send and email at karitaru at hotmail.com.<br />And after all the book is a nice read, and is much better than its predecessor, \\"The Hound of Baskervilles,\\" and I really recommend it.	2003-04-11
US	52261174	R2X0HQ94JETPBT	1404333150	339446198	Tales of Terror and Mystery	Books	4	5	8	N	N	From the Creator of Sherlock Holmes	The first thing I would like to mention is that this book is not at the level of any of the Sherlock Holmes's short stories, it is worse than the worst Sherlock Holmes's short stories collection (maybe the \\"His Last Bow,\\" since it had the lowest number of short stories as compared to the other collections).<br />Let us explore the book story by story:<br />1. The Horror of the Heights: (3 stars)<BR>This was not the best short story I ever read, said this plainly. It tells about a pilot trying to prove that there is a jungle up in the sky, above all the heights explored by human beings, and that jungle had creatures that like to mutilate humans once they see them. More than that I would be spoiling the plot.<br />2. The Leather Funnel: (2 stars)<BR>This is even a worse story. It speaks about the separating line between our world and dreamland. It simply asserts that you can see the past in your dreams, provided that you have something related to that past, just like a leather funnel, for example.<br />3. The New Catacomb: (4 stars)<BR>The first story to my liking. The good feature about this story is that it gives a twist of plot at the end. It starts with 2 archeologists in Rome, chatting about a catacomb discovered by one of them. In order for the latter to tell the former about the location of the catacomb he wanted to know about some private secret. In the catacomb a strange and interesting twist of plot takes place and the story ends in the best manner a writer can bring to end. Do not take me wrong, I figured this twist from the second page of the story, and I hope you do not, so that you can enjoy the ending.<br />4. The Case of Lady Sannox: (5 stars)<BR>This story introduces some elements of the Islamic orient (the middle east, if you please). It introduces the reader to a reckless gentleman, who is more of a ladies man. He is, as usual to that type of people, always broke. A Turk offers him money to cure his wife in a strange way. What is so interesting in the story? Of course the twist at the end, and that what made me give it 5 stars ... I did not figure it out until I reached 2 pages before the last one.<br />5. The Brazilian Cat: (4 stars)<BR>This story was not bad at all, it might have been better than \\"The Case of Lady Sannox,\\" in terms of the plot and characters. The reason I give it less stars than the other one is that Doyle speaks a lot, he explains many things, relevant and irrelevant. It speaks about a broken young lad - a character which appears frequently in the writings of Doyle - who is the direct heir of a miser uncle. He has got a second relative who had just come from Brazil, so he visited him to beg some money from him. There he is introduced to the relatives pet, a Brazilian cat. Saying more would kill the story, and beware, for there is a twist at the end.<br />6. The Lost Special: (2 stars)<BR>Where did a train disappear? I thought it would give me a very strange way, like it flied in the sky or something, but the way it disappeared was not insightful.<BR>7. The Beetle Hunter: (3 stars)<BR>An advertisement in the newspaper asks for someone very interested in Beetles, preferably an expert. The hero of the story applies and then is introduced to another expert in Beetles; a master, if you please. There is a twist at the end.<br />8. The Man with the Watches: (3 stars)<BR>An attempt to depart the realm of Sherlock Holmes, and to forsake his way of deduction. Here you must make a big assumption, and if it fits the crime, then it might actually be the right plot. But in this case it is not. A man and a woman enter a train, both of them disappear, and what remains is the body of a different man, what happened? The answer was more than I could imagine.<br />9. The Jappaned Box: (1 star)<BR>This is totally unworthy of Doyle. I am not going to say anything about it, you read it and see that it might have impressed people a hundred years ago but not anymore.<br />10. The Black Doctor: (3 stars)<BR>In a line with the Sherlock Holmes's adventures. A brunet comes to town and work as a doctor, he gets engaged to a lady and then, all of a sudden, he decides to forsake everything and leave the town, what is the reason? It will amaze you, to some extent.<br />11. The Jew's Breastplate: (3 stars)<BR>A Jewish masterpiece is being perturbed. The old manager of a museum steps aside to give the honor to the new one. The new manager is bedazzled with the strange occurrences. There is a twist at the end, but not that admirable.<br />12. The Nightmare Room: (2 stars)<BR>Totally unworthy of Doyle. The story is about 2 guys fighting over a woman. There is a twist at the end, but it turns everything allover. It is a wicked twist, if I may say.<br />And anyway, this book is worth reading, you are not going to bored reading it.	2003-04-11

Watson, M.D.	Books	3	2	5	N	Y	Better Than the Red Demon Stuff	I was again reluctant to read this sequel of the &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Red Demon,&quot; and the author disappointed me by writing a better novel (exactly as what happened when I read Meyer's &quot;The West End Horror&quot; after &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;).<br />But let me make this statement here: &quot;The West End Horror&quot; is by far much better than this &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Ice Palace Murders.&quot;<br />Again the same rich guy from Minnesota invited Holmes to his home town to investigate some mysterious occurrences in the Ice Palace there ... As if there are no good detectives in America. As long as we are talking nonsense here, why did not he summon Ellery Queen, who is not less intelligent than Holmes, or maybe Colombo (hohohoho).<br />The story this time had some mystery elements. It was, as a matter of fact, a whodunit. I figured the murderer out from half of the mystery, not because I was abnormally cleaver, but because of a fallacy the murderer inserted. The strange thing is that Millett did not allude to this fallacy, maybe he did not even know that it was there, and maybe I was lucky!<br />A new character is introduced in this novel, and Irish clever guy by the name Shadwell Rafferty. I'm not so enthusiastic about him, because he does not enrich the world of Sherlock Holmes, and people are more used to one superior detective in the story. After all, this is a pastiche to praise Sherlock Holmes, and no one else.<br />We reach to the conclusion of the story and the villain who killed every body was apprehended, and then nothing much, the story does not give me the impression I get from Doyle's writings. And I am not going to recommend the book, because I could have done well without reading it.	2003-04-11

I loved the movie and you could tell, I guess; but this book struck as directed toward the younger readers.<br />I do not mind the juvenile material, but the conversation was more that I can stand. And other than that it was a fine story.<br />If you had watched the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie, you'd know that it started with a hobbit (one of the Hobbits which is a tribe of halflings) named Bilbo, who was trying to have a big party for his elleventeen birthday (111 in the hobbit tongue, don't you think it is very childish for me, sigh). This story, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is the sole account of Bilbo's adventures, and is the predecessor of the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"<br />Gandalf, who appears in the \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" appears here too, and is one of the integral components of the story. He introduces Bilbo to 12 dwarfs (or dwarves as he insanely like to write it). The 12 dwarfs take Bilbo, who reluctantly agree to accompany them, on a trip to kill a dragon (what can be more childish). These dwarfs have some strange (childish) names, like dori, ori, nori, oin, and gloin.<br />They encounter some trolls, goblins (or orcs), and Bilbo meets a strange creature called Gollum. He gets his ring from there. They meet some more odd creatures and then reach the place where the dragon is.<br />They actually kill the dragon and then have a big fight with some other armies. Bilbo forsakes the dwarfs, for some reason or another. Things must be fixed, so Bilbo becomes a friend of the dwarfs one more time. He gets his share from the treasure of the dragon (all dragons must have treasures, you did not know that? oh my!) and then goes back to his hobbit hole, where he lives.<br />You are welcome to read, you might not get bored, but I am not all that enthusiastic.	2003-04-11

She is not your usual sweet Englishwoman, however, for she scolds him most of the time, and Holmes appears not to be offended by this treatment!<br />Religion is incorporated in this novel extensively, and this is really a draw back. Religion introduced in a Sherlock Holmes's Novel would not strike me as the best idea.<br />There are some small mysteries scatterd throughout the story, but they are utterly simple, even old Watson could have solved them without sweating. And always Moriarty was mentioned. At the end some letter was solved using some mathematics on base 8 (2 thumps up) and it turned out to be the hardest thing in the story, which resulted in a not so interesting conclusion.<br />I do not recommend it for any fan of Sherlock Holmes. But if you are more into romance, you might as well like it!	2003-04-11

It says in the back cover that this story belongs in the shelf with Christie's and Simenon's writings. I would be inclined to say it is not. It is more like the writing of Grisham. That does not mean it is bad (I gave it 4 stars); it means, on the other hand, that it is not a typical mystery.<br />When I started reading it, I thought it was a collection of short stories, and I wanted to read it concurrently with the last part of the \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" because it really bored me to death. Having started reading it, however, I realized that it was a novel, and a large one with 313 pages. I could not stop at the first chapter to go to the ring bearer, so I decided to read it to the end.<br />It is a nice introduction to the Japanese lifestyle. And other than that I would have given it 3 stars for the plot. It is a bit slow. Inspector Imanishi, is not your Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Miagret, Arsen Lupin, nor Ellery Queen; no, he is a simple guy, like me and you (more like me, because you might be a genius after all). He gets clues by mere chance, in an article in the news papers, in the talk of neighbours, in movies, ... etc.<br />He is in his fifties, so he is more in the Poirot's and Miagret's criterion. He is slow-minded, and needs time to get things together. He writes Haiko poetry, and likes to pour tea over his rice bowel (a thing I would never do in a million years). He likes plants, and has got a passive wife, who speaks with her husband in formal terms.<br />The murder occurred somewhere unknown in the beginning of the story, and the body was left on the railroad of some train. Nothing is discovered in the first chapter. Inspector Imanishi had to make a number of trips to many parts in Japan (two on the expense of the police, and the rest are on his expense, which means that he is a determined cop after all).<br />He discovered some facts about dialects in Japan. And here I must tell you that you should be comfortable with some Japanese terms, like san means Mr., and sensie means teacher, and so on.<br />I read the story in 4 days, and that means that I did not find it boring, because I have spend about 3 months reading the \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and did not finish it yet.<br />I am sure you are not going to be bored reading this story.	2003-04-11

I read this novel after an almost chronological reading in the Sherlock Holmes's novels and short stories.<br />I certainly started with \\"a study in scarlet\\" which was fine, then went to \\"the sign of four\\" which was even finer. These two novels where enough to get me hooked on the world of Doyle's Holmes. Then to make things even better, I read the \\"adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\\" a collection of short stories, which were excellent, followed by \\"the memoir of Sherlock Holmes\\" which was on the same lines as the adventures, but Sherlock Holmes was finally killed by Moriarty in the last short story of the collection. I was not afraid, because the remaining pages of the collection of stories I had was still thick, so I knew something was going to happen. Sure enough, Sherlock Holmes was resurrected in the next collection (not before \\"the hound of Baskervilles\\", although it is traditionally given before it in the complete works) which was called \\"the return of Sherlock Holmes.\\" Up to this point I was a big fan of Holmes, but this story: \\"the hound of Baskervilles,\\" came to destroy everything.<br />The first aspect I hated about it, was that it wasn't a mystery. It was a quest behind the villain, who was knowen by the middle of the story ... and no wonder, for Doyle wrote this after the acclaimed death of Holmes. He was not ready yet to bring back his detective, and he was actually going to write this story with different characters, until he was struck by Holmes as an already existing character of his, and that he needn't waste his time creating some new character line.<br />The story is not totally bad, but the idea of having Holmes in a non mystery novel did not strike me as plausible.<br />I recommend you to read it. It seems, from the review, that I was the only one not to like it, but I can't control that. What I do not like is what I do not like, and I hope you found something useful in this review.	2003-04-10

It also explores how he turned from a fundamentalist to a total disbeliever. ... 4 stars<br />The third part is the one I hated the most, it seemed to me as an account promoting communism. It explores the live of the sons and grand sons of Abdul-Jawad, who can't get out of his house. Homosexuality is added to this volume as an extra. Kamal is still studying and writing about philosophy, and is still a big time disbeliever. ... 3 stars<br />And over all, Mahfouz does a great job in expressing the feelings of people, but the only thing I hate about his writing style is that he makes no distinction between the narrator and the hero.	2003-02-15

Most of my teachers in number theory and algebra recommend this book as being the standard treatment of the subject. The subject is not at all simple, it requires a non trivial amount of abstract algebra. Moreover, what makes the subject relatively more important is its being a component of Wile's proof of Fermat's Last Theorm.  As you can guess from my rating the book was not so satisfactory for me. The edition that I read was I guess the first edition of the book, it did not have any index or preface, but that did not interfer in my gudgement. The thing I hated the most about this book, is that it uses old notation, which made the book wordy and less understandable. In the beginning of the book Dr Artin proves some results from linear algebra as if he assumes that people know nothing about it, but then later in the book he uses groups and quotient groups without defining them which implies that you should know something about group theory, but usually people with good knowledge in group theory are even more knowledgable in vector space theory. And I guess the moral here is that you really should have had some training in abstract algebra before you have read this book and for that I recommend Herstein's &quot;abstract algebra&quot; for those of you who have not had any course in group theory or Jacobson's &quot;Basic Algebra I&quot; Chapters I &amp; II for advanced students. For a better a book on the subject (only for advanced students) I recommend Jacobson's &quot;Basic Algebra I&quot; Chapter IV.	2001-02-26

I want you first to know that I have only read about 3/4 of the book and I have stopped after field extentions. I am trying here to comment on the book from a relatively more advanced point of view because I have had all the subjects in depth in some other classes. I think Hersteins treatment of groups is more than excellent I would not recommend any other book for group theory at the undergraduate level. But he starts loosing this track in his treatment of rings, and I feel he starts getting faster and faster in explaing ideals and I do not think he did it very well. Field extension and Galois theory go even faster. I think you should stop reading the book after group theory and try some other book in the subject of ring theory something like Jacobson's &quot;Basic Algebra I&quot; for advanced students. But the book is not that bad if you can absorb things fast enough. It even has a chapter about straight edge and compass constructions which is a remarkable subject for me. It even has an optional chapter about the simplicity of the permutation group and some more results on finite abelian groups (If I am not mistaking).	2001-02-26

I did not think it was that good it was rather slow and sorry to say boring. <br />If you have read many books by Agatha Christie and want to read  this book go ahead but you might not like because it is not so  thrilling.<br />If you really want to read some good stuff by Mrs Christie go  for &quot;The Secret adversery&quot; a tommy and Tuppence mystery it is not  really bad and you might like it.<br />If you want to read good mysteries I  would recommend Georges Simenon's Maigret's Novels they are really good and  M. Simenon is big time better than Mrs Christie (sorry to say that but try  and see)	2000-02-15
US	52261174	RMBMBC7SPO17K	013093089X	462853061	Introduction to Analysis, An	Books	2	4	9	N	N	This book needs more revision	I have studied this book in a two semester advanced calculus basis and the reason my teacher chose the book was because it is the only book she could find that touches both singl and multivariable functions calculus. This  book is said by many teachers of mine to be a very dry book and here by dry  I mean that it just gives you the theory of the concept not the  applications which are very important in the study of mathematics (or  atleast to attract people to mathematics)  I think this book is still  allright at least to complete the collections of mathematics books in one's  library.	1999-03-13
