I found it interesting how they both mention that the first four films was not how they saw Batman.  And they wanted to show a Batman more reminiscent to the character who actually shows up in the comic book.  They also wanted to keep the film grounded in reality and hearken back to the grand epic films by directors such as David Lean and John Houston. Which they more than achieved. It is clear that both men took the film seriously and wanted to make a film that audiences would enjoy. Much to my pleasure.<br /><br />This is a great book for those who loved Batman Begins. Or those who are interested in script writing.	2005-09-11

I have to go with everyone who said that this book really isn't ground breaking or innovative. And it really is simply rehash or \\"old school\\"<br /><br />But hey that's what I wanted in the first place.<br /><br />I was a serious X-Men devotee, back during the mid 90's when Fabian Nicienza and Scott Lobdell were working on the main X books. I could barely wait each month for the new book  to come out. Then Nicienza and Lobdell left or were replaced and new writers came on board. Sadly I found the new writers wanting and the tone and the flavour of the books had changed. And a love affair had ended.<br /><br />Over the years I tried to rekindle that love by picking up the X-Men here and there, but still I found that the books were still not the same. Including the Grant Morrison run which I found to be  pretentious,contrived and weird for weirds sakes.<br /><br />When I heard about the hoopla sorounding this book, that Joss Whedon actually wrote the characters \\"in character\\" I knew that I had to pick it up. And I have not been disapointed. I love the way he writes everyone, especially Emma Frost, one of the finest and best conceived female characters in comics. Shrewd, brilliant, rutheless yet compassionate.<br /><br />I had always had a problem with Morisson's, contrived, killing off of Jean Gray so that he could pair  Scott and Emma. I was suprised (and pleased) at how Whedon handled the entire situation. When Wolverine confronts Scott about his lack of respect for the dead (Jean being dead only a short while before Scott hooks up with Emma) I almost fell out of my chair. I could not believe that Whedon actually tackled the topic.<br /><br />What Joss Whedon offers in this book is just good old fashioned comic book story telling. With well drawn 3 dimensional characters and an interesting plot that advances.  I hope he sticks around.	2005-04-17

The Cult simply involves a story about Batman the disintergration of Gotham City, Bruce \\"Batman\\" Wayne's hometown. After a charismatic cult leader comes into town and influences the homeless people to take over the city. And Batman putting a stop to him.<br /><br />Essentially what this book is, is a condensed precursor to the five volume No Man's Land series which was published in the late 90's.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book a lot it is interesting and engaging. And shows Batman to be a formidable warrior without turning him into a  quasi ominipotent god. Jim Starlin is one of my two favorite Bat writers. In that he has always managed to capture all sides of Batman. By making him a 'man', a three dimensional human being. He's shrewd, formidable but still compassionate.<br /><br />I loved this story so much that I attended a convention, just to make sure Jim Starlin would sign it.<br /><br />This is a must for any true Batman afficianados.	2005-04-17

It was written mostly by Denny O'Neil and penciled by the Neal Adams, one of the most famous Batman artists ever.<br /><br />It involves eco terrorist Ra's Al Ghul as he takes on Batman. Ra's has one daughter, Talia. Whom Ra's wants Batman to marry as he is the only man worthy of her, and whom Ra's wants to take over his operations after he dies.<br /><br />Some view The Joker as Batman's greatest foe. But I say it is Ra's. He is Moriarty to Batman's Sherlock Holmes. And while there is an animus between both men. There is also a grudging respect. Almost like a father and son relationship.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with the James Bond films, will notice a startling simlarity between this book and the movie \\"On Her Majesties Secret Service\\". I don't know whether it was intentional or not but it seemed that movie(or book) was heavily refrenced in this book.<br /><br />The story is not that engaging, but I am not going to fault it for that because it was written back in the 70's. And writing styles have changed.  However this book is a must for Batman fans and those who want to know how the Ra's Al Ghul saga started.	2005-04-17

It involves one of the long time Birds of Prey  going to Hong Kong to see her dying martial arts  teacher. While there she meets Lady Shiva the DCU's deadliest assassin who used to also be a pupil of said teacher. The teacher gets killed and the book evolves into a long convoluted story that would be too long to rehash here.<br /><br />I have been with this book ever since Gail Simone took it over.  I was looking for a new book to collect and the addition of Huntress, one of my top favourite heroines meant that I would be collecting the book for sure.<br /><br />Gail Simone is one of the few comic book writers in the business who tells stories the old fashioned way.  Meaning she opens threads and keeps threads dangling to be addressed at a later date (you might want to read  the \\"Of Like Minds\\" TPB before reading this book).  Or to be frank she doesn't write for a trade. Something which many readers, including this reviewer, really appreciates. She has a lot of ideas and it shows in the book. She is also very good at writing action and the dialogue is crisp and a lot of fun.<br /><br />But I find that the action is sometimes too frenetic and too fast paced. Things happen without any explanation. It's as if the author wants to get from point A-Z without examining the in between. Sometimes I feel as if I am reading the comic book version of Charlie's Angels (the movie not the TV show).  But it was something that I was willing to overlook and dismiss as growing pains of the author. That is until I got to the last chapter of this story (issue #68). Which frankly made my hair stand on end and almost made me quit collecting the book altogether.<br /><br /> If there is one transgression I will not tolerate,  is a writer coming on board a book and writing a character out of their prescribed character.  Willy nilly changes to a character without any reason is something I find incredibly irritating. And unfortunately that was what Gail has done in this book. It seems that the author has a story in mind that she wants to tell, and she is going to write each character in a way that will fit with her story. As opposed to allowing each `Bird' to breath on their own.<br /><br />This greatest fault of this lies in Simone's portrayal of Huntress. She has not only ret-conned the characters past (Helena got fired for going AWOL not for showing up at school with bruises). But has also changed the characters personality.  For some reason Simone has decided that she wants to portray Huntress as a clich&eacute;d  one dimensional soap opera/ B-movie femme fatal given to loose behaviour. That is NOT who Huntress is, and it is not the same character I've admired and respected for the last four years. If it were I would not be a Huntress fan and I would not be reading BoP.<br /><br />Some BoP fans, mostly fans of Barbara \\"Oracle\\" Gordon, are annoyed that Huntress has been added to the team. Since the two women have never gotten along and Oracle has been shown to openly dislike Huntress. They argue that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for Oracle to call upon Huntress for help when she has access to such a wide network of allies. I on the other hand argue that Huntress has no business being in the group especially after the shabby way that Dinah and Barbara are treating her in this issue. Huntress has previously been portrayed as a very no nonsense and proud woman. Part of the reason she is not in the Bat group was because she couldn't tolerate Batman's arrogance. So I am supposed to believe that she would willingly stand by and allow Dinah and Barbara to disrespect her this way?  And not mention Josh.  Huntress' whole behaviour in this incident is not only out of character it's completely absurd.<br /><br />However I must praise Simone for coming on board and not writing Barbara as a neurotic mess, at least I could see where the change came from and was addressed.<br /><br />Anyway this is all academic and might in itself not bother readers who are unfamiliar with the character.  Or who don't mind a character being written out of character or who are just looking for a sugar fix and a fun read.<br /><br />While I am not completely pleased or happy with what Simone has done to Huntress. I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt for now. Because faults or not she's one of the few good writers in the industry who can still tell a comic book story the old fashioned way. And that  is to be appreciated.is is all academic and might in itself not bother readers who are unfamiliar with the character.

Who compensate big time for his mediocre and not well thought out stories. And his books sell well.<br /><br />I won't even bother to go into the plot in this book because there really isn't one. It simply involves a convoluted 'story' where Batman and Superman take down Lex Luthor.  Like another review posted the book is more about just  as many characters from the DCU as possible into a book than it is with any credible story telling.<br /><br />I bought this book primarily for Ed McGuiness' artwork. I love the way he draws Batman. But that, and a later apearance by Huntress, are the  two strongest selling points on this book.  Jeph Loeb is not a good story teller, and I wish that someone at DC would stop spoiling by pairing him with artists he doesn't deserve to work with.	2005-03-07

Eating more vegetables does make you feel full longer<br /><br />The Bible Cure for Weight Loss and Muscle Gain, is even better. Being an endomorph with a slow metabolysm my weight plateud for two years straight. It was when I read his book and bought the vitamins that he suggested the weight started comming off again.<br /><br />Taking a supplement of vitamins and minerals he suggested has gon a long way to nurrishing my body, and ceasing the intense cravings I was experiencing for carbohydrates.<br /><br />Colbert also points out how the body works and why sugars and starchs actually prevent weight loss. The example he gives of a woman who ate healthy but still couldn't loose weight because she was sucking on breath mints all day was mind blowing. Once she stopped the weight began to come off. It's amazing how something seeming so small can interfere with your wieght loss goals.<br /><br />You don't have to be a Christian or particularly relgious to get what Dr. Colbert suggests. His medical advice is spot on. There are a ton of diet books  out there. But I find that this one is the most simple and effective.

Primarily Batman: The Long Halloween, Batman Dark Victory and Batman Hush.<br /><br />Please note Jeph Loeb has to have done one of the worst portrayals Catwoman ever.

I am not a very easy person to impress and frankly I hardly read any fiction these days...especially mass market fiction. More often than not I just end up throwing it down a quarter of the way into it because it's either boring or predictable (this includes Deception Point also written by Dan Brown).<br />If this book had not been on sale I probably would not have touched it. But I am glad that I did.  I found Angels and Demons  to be a compelling read and very hard to put down. In fact I loved it so much that I bought several copies and have added it to my list of all time favorite books.<br />It was straightforward and  intelligently written without being pretentious or verbose. It's obvious that Dan Brown likes the written word. But unlike other  authors I did not feel that I was reading a pretentious tome where the author was trying to show off to the reader, his knowledge or how many degree s/he had.  It could have easily been made into a 1000 page plus door stopper with useless material that did not add anything to the story. But to Dan Brown's credit he just stuck with what was necessary.  There was nothing superfluous in this book.  But at the same time it was very intelligent.<br />It was well paced, and things went smoothly from point to point. Idea to idea. You sort of get the idea of that the book was written with a TV or big screen movie in mind.  Right down to where the heroine (beautiful of course) spends virtually the entire book outfitted in shorts and a tank top.<br />I found the protagonist Robert Langdon to be quite well written and interesting. It was nice to see an \\"intellectual\\" hero who wasn't quite the hopeless nebbish nerd.  More to the point he was quite likable.  And unlike Corso in the Club Dumas, I wasn't made to believe that this a man like that would really have a beautiful woman throw herself at him.<br />I also liked the heroine Vittoria. For once it was nice to read a story about a man and a woman working together without having it turn into a Harlequin like romance or a sexual escapade. I liked the way Langdon's and Vittoria's worked together without the overt sexual shenanigans.<br />One of the things that surprised me was Browns treatment of the Church...or to be more precise Christianity.  Unlike many of his contemporaries Brown did not use his book as an opportunity to take pot shots at Christians or the Church or ridicule it.  In fact several portions of the book show what a boon the Christian faith has had on the characters lives.  It was as if Brown was showing that one could both be a person of faith and a person of science.  The scientists and their mean narrow minded condemnation of faith came off worse of all in this book.  Especially in one instance where a group of scientists rejoice when a cardinal is murdered.<br />I also liked the construction of the Illuminati...considering the modern times we live in, the attack on people of faith I had to wonder if they really do exist.<br />Unlike some other reviewers I saw nothing against the \\"Church\\". If it was against anything it was against the strict adherence to tradition and legalism.  As a Protestant I already know that Christianity is about having a personal relationship with God. Not a stone building and rituals.<br />Finally to address the negative reviews.  I found most of the negative reviews towards this book to be rather specious and petty if not a  trifle arrogant.  I find it hard to take seriously reviews by people who question the intelligence of others or accuse others of not \\"having read much\\"  because they enjoyed  a book less than a bit credible to say the least.  I love reading the classics as much as the next person. And I still think that Angels and Demons is a wonderful  book.  I  will concede that the end was remarkably over the top. It was as if Dan Brown had this great idea for a book but he was not certain how he should end it.  And yes the end did stretch ones level of credulity.  The action scenes appeared to go on for a bit too long.  But since most of the book was such a page turner I am willing to forgive him for that.  In fact I<br />This book is for people who like a well paced, intelligent story and recognize if for what it is. A good yarn.  Dan Brown has managed to make me do something I haven't done in years.

During the process of the investigation they have a one-night stand.<br />I really disliked this story immensely primarily because both Nightwing and Huntress are written WAY out of character and do things that neither character would do.<br />Helena \\"Huntress\\" Bertinelli, is an Italian American, who comes from a traditional Italian background. She is a devout Catholic and more to the point she has a great sense of pride and self-respect. She would never stoop to seducing/sleeping with a man to get something.  More so what she desires more than anything in the world is Batman's respect and approval.  A  smart and shrewd woman like Huntress would know that seducing his former pupil in order to get in with him. Would be the fastest way of NOT getting Batman's respect. It would make her nothing more than a prostitute.  A reputation that Huntress would run a mile to stay away from.<br />Dick \\"Nightwing\\" Grayson is an old fashioned gentleman.  He is not the type of guy who indulges in one-night stands. Especially with a woman he barely knows and whom he really doesn't like.  He is a capable leader and is not easily manipulated, he would have seen right up front that Huntress had no genuine interest in him and would have not touched her.<br />Since this story was written three successive authors at DC comics have tried to 'clean' up the events in this book.  By having both characters refer to what happened as a \\"mistake\\".<br />I totally agree.  It was a \\"mistake\\" that this story ever saw the light of day. As it did a disservice to two great characters.	2004-03-21

I remember fondly waiting each Friday afternoon for the paper so that I could get my Phantom fix.<br /><br />However this treatment by Ben Raab doesn't bring back much nostalgia. It is absolutely is atrocious and does nothing for the character.

It has almost held the #1 spot for the 11 months that it has been on sale. And this is due to Jim Lee's spectacular art work. In this book Lee pays  a true homage, to my favorite comic book character.  He is the reason I bought four copies of the book at a time. And he is the reason I bought this trade.<br />The story on the other hand is something else. Jeph Loeb's sense of storytelling is more of a &quot;tell&quot; than a &quot;show&quot;.  Most of the story is driven forward by the narration in Batman's head. The premise of Hush is supposed to be someone manipulating Batman's foes to get at him.  But the truth of the matter is, with the exception of Killer Croc' (who is supposed to be too stupid to stage a kidnapping) it really isn't shown.<br />And of course there is Batman's \\"romance\\" with Catwoman.<br />Words can not express how put off with this part of the story. It's purely contrived and annoying.  Catwoman comes on to Batman in one of the most sexually agressive moves I have seen in a mainstream comic book. And by the next issue he is in love?<br />Please<br />In other Batman books (including Dark Victory and The Long Halloween-also written by Loeb)  he would have spurned her advances. To tell you the truth it is the portrayal of Catwoman that has ruined the book for me. The portrayal of Catwoman has to be the most annoying portrayal I have ever seen of the character. For the entire arc Catwoman behaviour alternates from bimbo to vixen. When she's a bimbo she comes across as comic relief in a tv sitcom. When she's a vixen, she comes across  like the Baroness in the Sound of Music.  I don't know what Jeph Loeb was doing as he's portrayed her excellently twice before. Her dialogue just grates on my nerves.<br />Still I must praise Loeb for giving such a great profile to Huntress. Another vigilante who gets along with Batman, like oil gets along with water. He portrayed her excellently , the fighter she is and how she will still do the right thing, no matter how badly she is treated by others.<br />Still I would recommend this book to Batman fans and collectors.

I tell them because he's a business man. He thinks and acts like a business man.  He is ruthless, single minded and cunning. And nowhere is this more apparent than in this title.<br />Normally when we think of Batman we think of a vigilante who haunts  the night trying to bring down the bad guys.  I believe that he is much more complex than this.  Batman is a man who, having suffered tragedy at a very young age, Has vowed never to be life's victim again. And thus, he does everything in his power to strategize and manipulate in order to make sure that he comes out on top. Like any successful man of power he plans all the way to end. Considering every possibility...everything that could and can go wrong in a given scenario.  Batman is the sort of hero Machiavelli would admire because he is willing to do ugly things (short of murder) to accomplish his objectives.<br />Law #2 in the 48 Laws of Power (by Robert Greene), says \\"never put too much trust in friends\\". And this is essentially what is behind Batman's actions in this book.  Batman is well aware of what lies behind men's hearts. He knows how fickle they can be.  They can be loyal to you one minute and betray you the next. This is what has driven Batman to accumulate information on each JLA member.  He has studied each member their character, their powers and has devised a stratagem to bring each one down. Should one of them turn to evil in the future.<br />Unfortunately Ra's Al Ghul  (translated as The Deamons Head) Batman's foe. Has discovered the information that Batman has been keeping in his lair. And has used it to disable each member of the JLA so that he can carry out his plan to \\"purify\\" the earth.<br />When the members of the JLA find out that the heart of their misfortune originated with Batman. They vote to expel him. Not only because of what Ra's has done. But also because they all feel that he has betrayed their friendship. By keeping information on each one of them, Batman has essentially shown that he did not think very highly of his teammates in the JLA...when they trusted and admired him. When Batman is cast out I think it registers on him how badly he has been mistaken about friendship. And sometimes there is far more to getting a job done than the \\"business is business\\" philosophy.<br />I am not a JLA fan but this really is a very good story. And I liked it because it provided a very good study to Batman. For all of Batman's strategising. He never considered what would happen if the information got into the wrong hands. He never stopped to consider how hurt his friends would be. When Batman is expelled he doesn't simply walk away and shrug his shoulders. He actually looks hurt that his teamates  have cast him aside for what he has done. It shows a different aspect to Batman than him simply being an arrogant loner. It shows that he actually cares about what other people think of him.

In Japan Nicholas studies martial arts and is the rival of another man...why we don't know.  There is constantly reference to a debt of honor that really isn't fully explained.  In New York Nicholas is being stalked by a Ninja who is trying to kill him. We are given no idea how or why Nicholas is in the states and why he moved there.<br />Also the story has Nicholas romantically/sexually involved with two women who are mentally disturbed and I was left puzzled as to why such an intelligent man would do something like that.<br />And as many reviewers pointed out the sex is very explicit. I wouldn't call it erotic. Pornographic is more the right word. As most of the scenes were lengthy and had really did not advance the plot.  There were two rape scenes. One involving incest that I found irritating and unecessary. The sex seemed to be just there for shock and titilation.<br />The book was interesting...but I think tighter editing would have served it better.	2003-08-14
US	50744013	R2Q3Z33LGA046M	0553581791	645616042	Critical Space	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Okay	I picked up (and stayed with the book) because I am a huge Greg  Rucka fan.<br />But as stated in my review of HCFB, I truly think that his best work is in mainstream comics. And after reading Critical Space that opinion has not changed.<br />The story involves Atticus Kodiak a proffessional body guard. In this story he ends up providing protection to a proffessional assasin by the name of Drama. Who had previously tried to kill him, and the things that ensue.<br />The book gets too bogged down in bodyguard proceedures and a long elaborate hunt near the beggining. I found it tedious and boring. I also found Atticus's interaction with his on and off girlfriend Bridgette annoying. It was clear she had serious anger problems and it was beyond me why Atticus put up with her.<br />What I did like in the book was Atticus' interaction with Drama herself. And the elaborate training he went through.  I don't think that it is a coincidence that Alena has many similarities to Huntress and Elektra --two comic book heroines whom were also trained to be assassins. Both of whom Rucka wrote about (both available in trade paper back form-higly reccomended). Like Huntress and Elektra...Alena is much more likable even as a villain. Than the supposedly \\"good women\\" in the book.<br />This is an okay book. But I truly did not  find it to be that much of an intriguing plot. Once you figure out who is out to get Drama, then you can pretty much figure out how the story will progress.  I would much rather recommend Rucka's work on Elektra and Huntress.	2003-06-16

I love it so much I pick it up time and time again to read. I disagree and think that his best writing is in mainstream comics as opposed to independents because there are certain topics which have to be handled carefully and requires much more fines, than simply using the bull in the China shop approach.  He is one of the best things that ever happened to DC comics.<br /><br />Helena Bertinelli  is the daughter of a former mob boss who  witnessed the execution of her entire family before her eyes as a child. Now all grown up she has embarked on a one woman quest to wipe out the mob in Gotham.  She gets framed for a murder and has to figure out who did it.  In the process she finds out something very shocking about herself  as well as why she survived the massacre on her family.<br /><br />In the usual Rucka fashion he looks into the demons and what drives Helena/Huntress. And forces her to examine herself, and what she is running away from.  One of the reasons I love Rucka's treatment of the character is that she is nuanced.  Other writers often portray her simply as an angry woman with a chip on her shoulder. But Greg Rucka doesn't.  But Rucka shows her to be much more than that. Which is great since people are not that simplistic.  The common stereotype of Huntress is that she's \\"crazy\\". Nothing could be further from the truth. Helena Bertinelli is a very sane, intelligent and lucid woman-her problem is that she has a little problem with anger. And as the story progresses you see why she is so angry. Not only as a result of her life experience. But as a way of sheltering her heart from  being hurt.  When you look at it Huntress and Batman are essentially two sides of the same coin. The only difference is that Batman implodes his anger and she explodes it.<br /><br />Huntress  secretly craves the approval of Batman (who inspired her) and longs to be a part of his inner circle. But not at the cost of betraying who she is. She senses that Batman & co. do not approve of her---and she wants to be accepted for who she is. There is also the simple fact that Huntress and Batman do not get along because they have the exact same personality, and get on each others nerves. Watching them interact is often amusing as they fight almost like an old married couple.<br /><br />Unlike other comic book heroines whom I like (such as the X-men's Storm, Psylocke and Emma  Frost or the Wildcats Zealot) Huntress is not the kind of woman  I would like to be.  She is the kind of woman I am right now.  She's flawed but has a very good heart and tries to do what is right in her own way.  She also has a strong sense of pride and self-respect which drive her.  This all makes her much easier to relate to.<br /><br />I would also like to mention the dialogue in this book, it is much more every day and realistic. Such as the back and forth banter (flirtation) between Huntress and the Question.<br /><br />What Rucka does with Huntress in this book is awe-inspiring.

They don't mind working up a good sweat.  They're proud of the bodies they've worked into shape.  There is nothing powdery or gushy about them.  In other words the women in the swimsuit issue are not the worse role models a young girl could have.\\"<br />And she's absolutely right. If I had abs like that I would show them off proudly too!!!  Knowing a little bit about physical fitness...I know that it takes a lot of discipline and hard work to get your body to look that toned.  The last thing in the world I would do is criticize them for this.  I came to SI just by chance I saw the 1995 special on TV  and was left majorly impressed at how the young women conducted themselves. They were definitely no ones \\"hoochies\\".  Actually I was so impressed that when I saw several of them on the covers of various magazines etc.. I immediately remembered their names.  And that is not something that happens with everyone.<br />  I never understood the hullabaloo people make about the SI swimsuit issues. I think that it is absolutely wonderful.  My favorite period was when Jules Campbell was the editor. The woman definitely had an eye for (tasteful) beauty.  It was pure old school: In that while the models were certainly appealing-it was always in a DIGNIFIED WAY-everything about these ladies  said \\"respect me\\". These women carried themselves with the confidence of Queens.  They exuded assurance and implied that they had the world on a string.<br />The pictures in the book are  absolutely exquisite and are worth every penny.<br />Believe it or not in a world where actresses and film stars often look as if they work in the adult entertainment business. The SI swimsuit models are not the worst role models young girls can have. Thanks ladies for providing such an inspiration to me!	2002-12-08

I have all 9 volumes and have given this a go about three times but have never been able to move past volume 5 because of the way the story is set up. I got the feeling that you need to know how the Yakuza (the Japanese mob) is set up, as well as the geography of Japan to follow the story well. For example I have no idea what the Kanto region is. There seem to be several different factions of the Yakuza and among those factions they are again fragmented into different parties. It is hard to follow who is on whose side and who isn't on whose side and why is that person going after that person. Phew! You practically need a score card to keep up with the story!<br />I prefered to focus on the main characters Hojo and Asami. Two very unique men with unshakable faith and confidence in themselves that has nothing to do with arrogance. That is the reason I keep picking up the books again and again. I can not help but idolize them particularly Hojo. Here is a man who will go after what he wants without hesitation. But at the same time he has a great deal of loyalty and kindness to those he loves and likes.<br />Of course there is Ikegami's art work. He can easily be described as the Michelangelo of the manga world. Because of his clean and expressive drawings. You find that you can see how a character functions simply by the way that he has him/her stand. Or tilt his head. It really is phenominal.<br />But like another reviewer said this book has to be seriously docked for the casual and capricious dipiction of rape. It was horrible and disgusting and took away from the story.<br />I would recommend Sanctuary to those who are looking for an in depth manga story that will make you pay attention.	2002-06-28

The tittle of this book should really be described as &quot;How to be jerk&quot; Because that's all he does is point out the nefarious dealings of some of socities most cuthroat business people and politicians. But whereas other authors have pointed out the subtlety of the Machiavellan maneouvers, Bing describes his subjects as if they were wearing a set of horns and everyone should be able to spot them a mile away. Maybe its' a bit different down in the US. I live in Canada and believe me no business leader or politician (unless he/she was at THE top) could carry on in this way without getting fired.<br />Yes the business world is horrible but there are other much more effective books on the shennanigans of corporate climbing than this.<br />If it wasn't for Bings snarky remarks perhaps I would be able take this book a bit more seriously.

This book has served as an excellent guide. I strongly believe that The Lord was the one who led me to this book. On the surface 48 Laws might seem as a book on how to gain power by any means necessary. But if you read below the surface Greene is warning you to peoples under handed and duplicitous tricks. The book also serves as a nasty wake up call as to how the world really works. We may like to think that we live in a civilized society where people are not nasty and vicious. But the truth is things have not really changed that much at all. The only difference is that nowadays the viciousness and nastiness has become more cultured and refined.

I was very reluctant to purchase this book. I heard that Nancy Mace was the daughter of one of the schools top alumnus and one of the faculty staff. So I thought that the book would be a Citadel Love in.<br />It wasn't.<br />Contarary to what was reported Nancy did not get a cake walk through her first year. In fact she had just as much as tough time as everyone else. She had to endure the pressures of first year while coping with a learning disabilty, ostrazation and an unpleasant roomate. Many went to great lengths to show that they did not want her there. Among them wives and Mothers of Citadel men who cursed her on a regular basis (so much for the stereotype of the Southern Lady). But through it all she managed to endure with her head held high. While she does complain about her treatment by some unsavory characters. She also praises the treatment and the camederie she received from her fellow classmates. And more importantly upperclassmen whose respect she begins to earn as time goes on.<br />This book also conteracts some of the negative publicity that the Citadel received most notably on 60 minutes. The book mentions that some of the bashers of the school are no angels themselves. And found it easier to complain on national TV and sue, as opposed to toughing it out and building character.<br />The reason I am giving this book four stars is due to the length, I expected something a bit longer and she mostly just discusses her first year. And skims briefly over her last three years. I was expecting something a bit more substantial in those areas, but I still found it a great read.<br />In The Company of Men is an excellent example of a school growing up and the kind of people it develops. Nancy Mace is the best example of this. The Citadel should have no regrets about admitting women, Nancy Mace is a great example of this.	2002-06-09

Needing an aesthetic fix I picked this book up one day simply for the art and after reading I was not disapointed either by the writing. Chuck Dixon is a great writer and along with Scot McDaniels pencils it makes this book a must have.<br />Nightwing is a spin off character from the Batman franchise. He's the first Robin, Dick Grayson, all grown up now and his own man. He goes to a Bludhaven an industrial city sent by his mentor/Father Batman to solve a crime.  In the process Nightwing decides to stay in Bludhaven because he can make a difference as well as get away from under the shadow of Batman.<br /> I like Nightwing a lot. He's likable, smart,kind,confident and sexy.the type of guy every girl dreams of having for a boyfriend (or husband). Nightwing is constantly being hit on by women in his books and not without reason.  For male comic book readers he has more of a realistic kind of masculinity, none of the overbearing machismo, which is what makes him so popular with male readers.<br />Nightwing is supposed to be his own character in his own right. But frankly I think that he's DC's answer to Spiderman. I find the two characters very similar except for the fact that Nightwing has no superpowers and he's a bit more confident than Spider-man in his real life. Unlike Batman (or Spider-man) Nightwing does not do what he does because he feels it's his responsibility to make the world right. He does what he does because its the right thing to do.<br />Anyway this is a very good book one of the better books in DC's arsenal because it has a lot of action and the character, unlike Batman really does have a life when he's not in costume.  I love the character so much that even though I have the four TPB I also collected the entire run in single print. Its that good. I would also recomend the second TPB Rough Justice as the art work is a bit more sexy and hard edged. TPB 3& 4 Love and Bullets and a Darker Shade of Justice are a bit more cartoony. But the writing is good all aroundall around	2002-05-16

Heck I even have a Spider-man tatoo.<br />That being said, this is a terrible rendition of the Spider-man franchise. I totally understand Marvels wanting to revamp the story for the 21st century and draw in new readers or to be more precise bring in more money. But they seriously dropped the ball in this effort. The reason I love Peter Parker a.k.a Spider-man so much; Was that he was different from other boys his age. It was not just his super powers that made him unique. It was that Peter was actually a GENTLEMAN!!!! He was compassionate and cared for others and was willing to put the needs of others before his own. He was the total antithesis of your typical self-centered foul mouthed teenage boy who had his middle finger in the air to the world. Unfortunetly this last description is more in line with Bendis' version of Peter Parker. In the Ultimate Spider-man Brian Micheal Bendis has turned Peter into a foul mouthed, truculent boy who is rude to his elderly Aunt and Unlce who have actually sacrificed to raise him. This is NOT the Peter Parker I spent the last 13 years admiring. Bendis is not a very good writer and he seems to think that putting in cuss words and smart alecky remarks constitutes clever writing. Further he actually thinks that he's actually making the character a realistic teenage boy. Oh really how many teenagers do you know swing from spider webs and scale walls with their bare hands?  I have no problem with a story being tweaked. But tweak is not what Bendis does. He uses a hatchet where a fly swatter will do.<br /> When I bought this book the comic book dealer wouldn't let me flip through it--I now see why. I must have gotten half way through the TPB before throwing it across the room in disgust.<br />I would only recommend this book to people who are unfamiliar with Spider-man. But for you long time \\"Web heads\\" out there I strongly recommend against you picking up this book. It is a true sacrilege to a hero of our time.up this book.

In that Batman, painted by Alex Ross, is portrayed as if he were real. In the comic book Batman/Bruce Wayne is supposed to be in his mid 30's yet he looks as if he were carved by the hands of Michelangelo.  Whereas in this book he looks more in synch with a large man in his mid 30's with thinning hair, portly physique etc.  The costume is also more realistic in the comic book (as in all comic books) the fabric seems to mould every muscle of the body. In this book the costume envelops the body more the way that clothes usually do.<br />  The story appears to fall more realistically than the comic book too.

Sadly it did not.<br />I tried to read the book but found it boring and unispired. I found that the Authority is a lot like Spawn. Big on violence and short on storyline. None of the characters are developed and seem to simply exist for wreaking havoc against their enemies.<br />As for the two gay characters Appollo and the Midnighter, while they are there. There is no big deal or big play on their relationship, and should not in itself put off anyone who is adverse to such relations.<br />The only thing I liked about The Authority is the character of the Midnighter, who can be described as a non-self absorbed Batman.  I found that he had much substance and hopefully someone will give him his own book one day.<br />If you are looking for a book with a good story and well plotted characters then avoid this book.

After two years the jury's still out  on this book, even though I own both Hardcover and paper back copies of the book. This story involves a homosexual romance between a 19th century French Vitner and an Angel. It takes place over the life of the Vitner when he was a boy until his death of an old man.<br />I liked: The author is a great writer, her prose is exquisite and she puts words to paper wonderfully, without being pretentious.  But most of all I loved her idea of the structure of Heaven and Hell. They actually have societies within each. It was really interesting and original without borrowing from established sources. She even gives the angels in the story a distinctive personality, and God is as loving as ever.  Most of the times when authors tackle subjects like this they become sacriligious and are mocking of Judeo-Christian teachings.  But not Elizabeth Knox, she spins her original tale of Heaven and Hell without being disrespectful.<br />I disliked: The homosexual romance, I just found that it did not work.  Especially with Sobran the vitner. He wasn't really a sympathetic character. How anyone could fall in love with him was beyond me.<br />  The jury is still out on this book for me.  But if you want to read an original story about Heaven and Hell with beautiful writing pick up this book.	2001-11-19

I have never been to Annapolis neither do I know anyone who has gone there. But I can not help but feel that this is what it really must have been like to attend the school at least in the 1960's ...<br /><br /> Anyway some of the reasons I feel that this is an accurate description of the school is that James Webb is a decorated member of the military and one of the schools most illustrious graduates. He isn't some disgruntled man who wants to get back at the school by writing a bitter memoir as is the case with Lucien Truscott \\"Dress Grey\\" (based on his time at West Point). Another thing I loved about this book is how Webb rips off the shinny veneer of Annapolis being an elitist institution. Too many times when you read a book about the service academies the author makes it look like paradise on earth. There is none of this in a Sense of Honor. Yes you can get the sense that while Annapolis is a great school it is certainly not perfect and without its probblems.<br /> I think that this book is one of the most balanced books I have ever read. A Sense of Honor basically covers three stages of men who have attended Annapolis. There is Ted Lenehan a marine corps officer and Annapolis grad who has returned to the school as Tactical officer after being injured in Vietnam. Bill Fogarty a gung ho fourth year or first class midshipman who though he sometimes complains about the life he has to endure at Annapolis is whole-heartedly devouted to the military and can not abide those who are not ship shape. John Dean a first year midshipmen or plebe who has transfered to Annapolis simply for the \\"education\\" he hates the military life but by the end of the story he finds out what he is made of. The story takes place over the period of about at week, but amazingly Webb seems to cover every facet of the school its traditions, to the pranks that the mids play on their commanding officers.<br />Why this book has not been made into a film yet is beyond me. It really is that good.is book has not been made into a film yet is beyond me. It really is that good.	2001-11-03

A fact was confirmed after seeing pictures of  Citadel cadets dressed up as Nazi's in their yearbook.<br />I found this to be a wonderful and engrossing book and I am frankly not surprised that most of the negative reviews come from Citadel attendies.  In his books The Boo and The Lords of Discipline Pat Conroy  (who for years was villified by  his alma matter) basically stated that most of those who attended the Citadel thought that it was paradise on earth and &quot;God created it on the eigth day after he rested&quot;. Obviously some have problems with criticism of their school and can't handle it.  The Citadel has always fascinated me and I was intrigued by this book which I actually read in record time. The book gives a fascinating account of the school, and the history of Charleston.<br />  Yes this book is at times  is harsh and does not reflect the school in a good light.  But it isn't as if Ms. Minegold is the first to do so. Numerous news organizations among them 60 Minutes have done pieces on the school and their handling of  the comming of women.  To this date I really don't think that I have read one positive piece on the Citadel which does not make the school into a factory for bullies and sadists. Hopefully one day one graduate (hopefully female) will give a true and balanced acount of the school.<br />  From what I have seen lately it seems as if the school has done some growing up and is truly trying to change their reputation.	2001-10-31

I was looking for a bit more detail as to life at the &quot;I&quot; and unfortunetly Mrs. Fairchild spent too much time concentrating on the squables between Alumni and faculty.  I wanted to know what it was like to be a woman attending this institution for the first time.  I also wanted to know what it was like to be a cadet at VMI.<br />  The book is not good as Catherine Minegold's &quot;In Glory's Shadow&quot;. Or more to the point Disher's &quot;First Class&quot; a fictional account of the first female class to attend Annapolis -this book covers all four years.<br />Like someone said this book is really not finished and I am waiting with baited breath for a &quot;brother rat&quot; to re-count her four years at VMI.	2001-10-31

This is without a doubt one of THE BEST and most satisfying reads I have read in a long long time. I love this book for four main reasons:<br />  Whereas many authors(read women) of her generation go on and on with verbose and pretentious dialogue.  Anita Diamant simply cuts to the chase and tells it like it is. She only takes 300+ pages to her story whereas most other authors would have taken a story like this and turned it into a door stopper of 1000+ pages.<br />  Ms. Diamant is the kind of woman writer I have been praying for.  She writes with a forcefullness and a bluntness that I can admire without comming across as angry or self-pity. Which is unfortunetly the case with too many women authors out there. Which is one of the reasons I tend to stay far away from  modern female literary authors who write fiction.  Her prose is exquisite she is the kind of author I aspire to be.<br />So many authors who write Biblical fiction do it as if they are preaching a sermon on morality. Too many of the Biblical characters are treated as holier than thou and saints.  Not as flesh and blood human beings. Who have faults and foibles.  I actually picked up The Red Tent as a result of Orson Scott Cards Sarah.  I promptly dropped 'Sarah' after being turned off of his characterization of the Egyptians being stupid and hedonistic.  While the Cananites (the Hebrews) were pure and upstanding people who could and did no wrong. This is a patronising and condescending (if not also racist) attitude. Not so with Anita Diamant.  She shows all the characters warts and halos.  There are good members of Jacobs family and there are good Egyptians. Diamant that there are many aspects of the human condition. Yes and even those who are in the Bible.  One of the things which I found surprising and original is that the women in the story do not worship El (the God of Jacob) they still adhere to their own gods.  I thought that was really original.<br />Normally when I read a &quot;sex scene&quot; in a book I quickly skim past it.  But Diamants  love scenes are so tender.  And so are the men in the novel always attentive to the needs of women (we should all be so lucky!) Diamant is one of the few women out there who can really dish out this kind of scene without it being clumsy or gratuitous.<br />I have only one minor quibble, it is beyond me how/why she saw Joseph(my favorite biblical character) as a homosexual.  In all my reading of the Bible and research into other sources I saw no evidence of this.  Unless of course one wants to consider the fact that he rebuffed the advances of his bosses wife on account that it was wrong. A terrible stereotype if there ever was one.<br />In short this was an excellent book and will definetly be added to my top ten favorites. Pick it up you won't regret it!n a book I quickly skim past it.  But Diamants  love scenes are so tender.

US	50744013	R1KF4WER919EJC	0965890406	52219334	The Institute - Virginia Military Institute	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Beautiful!	This really is a very nice book, with fabulous photgraphy which makes the book worth every penny of its price.  The book was written just before the admission of women to its school, and therefore focuses on it being an all male school.<br />One of the things I loved about this book is how contemporary it is.  Normally when I have picked up books on military colleges, the author spends pages and pages going on about the schools hisotry and its early formation and those who  were involved in it.  A miniscule amount of time is spent looking at the lives of cadets and how the school is structured (such was the case with Drawing out the Man, a historical book by a VMI grad). Fortunetly this is not the case with the Institute. The book looks at the lives of Rats (first year cadets) as it is right now and their transitions through the school.<br />This book has also taught me how far VMI has come.  VMI is not afraid of positive making positive changes.  Unlike another somewhat infamous military college.  VMI will shed some of it more archaic traditions in order to be welcoming to others (There were several shots of multi-ethnic cadets).  The school has seemed to shed some of its old emphasis on worhipping the Confederate Old South.  And has now turned into a school dedicated to educating young people and building them up with character and fortitude. Which in my eyes is what makes this school truly great and unique.<br />  I am too old to attend VMI now, but if I could I would quickly enter.<br />Rah! Rah! VMI	2001-07-14
US	50744013	ROSFFNPC49061	3823854917	527900056	Woman	Books	3	24	25	N	N	What can I say?	I bought this book primarily because I am a big fan of Andreas. I bought his first book &quot;Nudes&quot; two years ago and I have not regreted it since. I constantly pick it up for the sensuality and the power that resonates in the pictures.<br />That being said I am not that thrilled about &quot;Women&quot;. The photography is nice, it is the poses I have a problem with. I don't have a problem with looking at (atheltic)nude women. In fact I derive a lot of inspiration from them. But these are usually the sort of women who have a sort of &quot;regal&quot; and &quot;dignified&quot; look to them. In short the model has to give off an aura that she is there for herself and not simply to titilate men. Which unfortunetly is what &quot;Women&quot; does.<br />The photos for &quot;Women&quot; primarily consist of left over shots he did for Playboy and Max. So in short the photography basically fits into the realm of titilation.<br />So while you may want to purchase this book for Andreas formidable photography. Keep in mind the subject mater.	2001-07-02

Chris Claremont does a good job writing and gives an interesting and well developed plot that was not done before or since. My favorite (and the only reason I bother with the book) WC character is Zealot.  This story places a multi-dimensional side to her and gives some further background to her and  introduces a family member.  I own two copies of this book and several copies of the individual issues.  There was a short excerpt in issue 13 which illustrates the background between Tapestry and Zealot which was not included in the graphic novel which is a shame.  I also think that this issue provides some of the best art work Jim Lee ever did.  Very cool and sexy.	2001-06-21

I have seen TR twice since its release and this one represents the script and on screen action much better than Sterns'.  Lara has been a heroine to me ever since I read about the video game in an issue of Newsweek four years ago.  So it really is important to me that a writer gets her character down cold and that is what Mel Oldam has done in this novelization.	2001-06-20

But the first time I ever read Michelangelo's poems directed towards Vittoria Colonna I knew that I was in love.  The intensity and the beauty of it is so touching especially considering he was  an old man when they were penned.  Make it much more real, like a man who is truly pouring out his heart as opposed to someone who  is just spouting words to gain the &quot;favors&quot; of a lady.  Michelanglo is one of the few artists who have ever lived who have shown the true meaning of beauty. &quot;My lady, these eyes see vividly-far, near-/your radiant face, wherever it is here,there.&quot;-absolutely.	2001-06-14

The men are displayed in a masculine manner without going overboard, or more to the point without being vulgar. Which is the true meaning of sexy. The lighting is stunning and beyond words.  I bought LG's calender last year. But the book is much better and really brings out the photographers talent.  The only reason I am giving this four out of  five stars, is that I think that Andreas Bitesnich is the best photagrapher on the planet and LG stuff does not quite measure up. But trust me this book is worth your money!	2001-03-11

Anyone of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim faith should not pick up this book because you will be seriously offended.  Mr. Kirsh takes several Biblical passages out of context to use  in his argument. His attitude towards anyone who believes is devoutly  religious and believes strongly in the words of the Bible is extreemly  condeceding.  He says &quot;If you read the Bible with open eyes and an  open mind&quot;.  Therefore presuposing anyone who does not see things his  way is narrow minded. It was not until I got trough the first 30 or so  pages did I realise that none of the &quot;rave reviews&quot; he received  were from any clergy or religious orders.  Further I realised that Mr.  Kirsch views are not stated out in the open.  You don't see his perjorative  view towards the Bible, Moses and God until AFTER you've got into reading  the book.  I would only recomend this book to aetheists and others who are  contemptuous of the Bible and the above faiths.	1999-11-30
