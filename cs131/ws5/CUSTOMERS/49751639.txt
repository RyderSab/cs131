This book is an example of that reason.<br />It is a superb book, combining historic events (the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff, the murder of the Nazi official of the same name, and the rise of neo-Nazism on the internet) with the narrator's ties to family and his attempts to understand himself and his son.<br />It is disturbing, as good literature always is, because it raises hard questions.  When is enough enough?  Do we ever let go of past grudges?  Wilhelm Gustloff, a Nazi organizer in Switzerland, is shot by a Jew who immediately turns himself in.  Does that make either the perpetrator or the victim a hero?  The murder receives enough attention that a ship is named after the victim.  Near the end of the war, a Russian submarine sinks the ship in the Baltic Sea, at great loss of life.  There are many civilians and children lost (literally thousands).  There are also military personnel on board, and the ship still has military markings.  Who is at fault here?  Fifty years later the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff, and it's obscurity relative to the much more famous sinking of the Titanic, becomes a hot topic among neo-Nazis on the internet.<br />It is all so real.  It is all so believable (enter the name of the ship in a search engine and look at some of the things that come up).<br />Great art raises great questions.  This is great art.	2003-05-15

They started in Europe before that.  The most explicit airing was during the fight for the confirmation of our Constitution.  The case for our constitution was most forcefully and successfully presented in \\"The Federalist Papers.\\"  The Constitution was ratified, but the argument has not ended.  It is continued in Fareed Zakarias' book.<br />Simply put the questions are: \\"What kind of government best protects individual and collective freedom?\\" and  \\"In a democratic government, how are minorities protected from an oppressive majority?\\"  There is a new question that is added here:  \\"In a democratic government, how is the majority protected from a highly organized and well financed minority?\\"<br />As this book points out, it is a particularly important time for us to be clear about our definition of phrases like \\"good government,\\" \\"democracy,\\" and \\"freedom.\\"  We are in a new position, responsible for defining and guaranteeing those ideas for countries (or should we say a groups of people) we have occupied (Afghanistan, Iraq), in a region with no real experience in either democracy or constitutional law.<BR> <BR>Over two hundred years ago, the question was resolved by removing much of the government in the United States from direct involvement of the people (a President selected by electors, Senators selected by State Legislators, Judges appointed for life).  Since then, much has changed.  Most of the changes have been by adding more democracy.<br />The questions raised here are two fold.  First, have the changes been good for us.  Are we closer to \\"good government\\"?  Second, and more importantly as we develop policies and expectations for the Middle East, what does it take to establish freedom and democracy in that region?<br />These are important questions to ask.  This book presents an argument, and suggests an approach.  Agree or disagree, the argument must be raised repeatedly.  It is important to get the answer right, again.	2003-05-14

Ones where the first paragraph lets you know what the arc of the book is going to be.  It sounds interesting.  You want to read it.  You were right in your prediction.  It gives you a comfortable feeling to have been right.  And you don't have to think.  This is not one of those books.  At least in its most fundamental sense it is not.<br />It seems to be at first.  In 1935, on a country estate, a young girl with a vivid imagination tries to explain something that she sees.  She does not understand what she has seen, but how many of us do at that age.  She thinks she has seen something she has not.  She is not puzzled, she is sure of what she has seen, and what it means, but she is wrong.  That evening other events lead to misleading, but convincing, statements to the police.  Then everyone must live with the consequences.  Five years later, that now young woman must come to grips with what she has set in motion, and its consequences.<br />Simple enough, and if that was all there was, it would be a good book.  That's not all there is.  The book goes further forward, to 1999.  Events have played out.  People have lived their lives.  We have to accept truth, and the truth is what makes what would be a good book a great book.<br />The difference, the ending, makes it a fantastic choice for those of us who hate to read a book only once!	2003-04-24

OK, you've read many holocaust books, probably seen several movies, been there, done that.<br />This one is different, and different in so many ways that you'll never believe you've read one before.<br />Of course there are not many that start the story in 1105, that's different.  There are not many that try to fix the story in a context that is greater than the ending.  This one does that, and makes it so strong that you can not put it down.<br />First the context, the myth if you will.  There are in the world 36 `just men' that take on the suffering of the world, that are the reasons God allows the world to continue.  There are among these men, some number of `unknown just' who see the world differently from most of us.  That when one of these `unknown just' dies his soul is so cold that God must hold him in his fingers for a thousand years so that he can open to paradise.  <br />Ernie Levy is one of those men.  A thousand years of history, two thousand years of suffering are all concentrated in the story of one boy, the movement of a family from Poland, to Germany, to France, to extermination.  It's all so simple.  It's all so wonderfully told.  The story of a people, the story of a family, the story of a man, the story of the twentieth century, all in so few pages.<br />I hope you'll take the time to read it.	2003-04-09

This is one of them.<br />With some less well-constructed books, or less thoughtful books, you can read it once, know what you think, and know that if you read it again you will think the same thing. This is not one of those.<br />It is written to draw you in.  It is written as if you were inside the mind of a twenty-year-old who (along with his friend) is trying to figure out the history of his town, his family, and his part of the country.  Each time he gets something, it opens another path that must be explored.  Just like it was for all of us when we were that age and just got a new bit of information about our parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents or their friends, or their enemies.<br />So, it is the story of many things.  It's primarily the story of the Thomas Sutpen, his life in Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi (a name and place familiar to any reader of Faulkner), and of his effect on the future of the Coldfield's.  It is also the story of the devil, of the South, of a culture that had to die, of fate, of destiny, and of our need to hold onto the past.  It is also the story of all of us, our need to know more, and our recoil when we find out more than we want to know.<br />Read this novel like a poem.  Read it first to get the general flow, read it again for details, then read it again to notice words and structure, the way you travel constantly through time (from 1910 to 1833 to 1861-65) and space (Harvard, Mississippi, Haiti).  Each time you read it, you will be satisfied.  The last time you read it will be as satisfying as the first.  What more can you ask from a single work of art?	2002-10-03

It's an after battle report, and it's a good one.  The authors were there.  It shows.<br />This book takes you step by step through the preparations for, and the details of, one of the first and deadliest battles in Vietnam.  It does so through the eyes of the commander in the field, one who had great respect for the men in his command, and the men (especially some helicopter pilots) who supported them.<br />It bogs down occasionally, but even that is welcome since it is usually the relating of individual soldiers age's, hometown's, and family details that makes sure everyone is remembered for the effort and sacrifice they made.<br />The book also carries a battlefield commander's appraisal of larger political questions of government support of the effort and the troops, restrictions on movement or pursuit, and the decision to maintain the regular enlistment period (and let go of the best trained men) and rigid 'tour' of men, and the 'ticket stamping' rotation of officer's combat assignments.<br />These are valid questions, and should be debated much more than they ever will be.  They also detract from the relation of the battle (actually battles) that were fought, and the 'fog of war' that existed.<br />The book shows the pride of a professional soldier and the respect he has for his enemy.  Both viewpoints frequently missing in a typical novel.<br />Well worth the effort.  Read it.	2002-07-17

The personal memoirs of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" make fascinating reading.  Much more interesting and revealing than the movie we have all seen.  The book is extremely well written and very interesting.  The description of landscape, weather, living conditions, and food reveal more about the variety of textures of sands, floods, retained water, and plants in the desert than anyone from a more temperate climate would ever expect.  Who could expect the problems associated with rescuing a camel from a snowstorm?  Or the details of providing food for both camel and man?<br />His view of the Arab tribes and leaders he met provides a wealth of insight into the expectations from both sides, and how those expectations are infrequently met.  He spends considerable time contrasting the `Arab' way of life, both between the various tribes and with the Turks and the English.  Not surprising, he seems fascinated with the `Arab,' and then, as time, internal conflict, and experience go on an increasing pull to the life and overcast weather of England.<br />Many of the most revealing passages in the book relate the internal struggle in what he describes as a basic dishonesty of his position dealing with what he presents as a basically honest, talented, illiterate people and the ultimate betrayal of the Arab Uprising that he was so intimately involved in.<br />As with most personal memoirs, this book probably over states personal accomplishments, dismisses or ignores major accomplishments of others, and definitely presents an individual point of view of everything and everyone around him.  Well worth reading, just for that.	2002-05-30

I guess the best thing about this book is that it reminds us of what we are missing.  It also gave me a bit of detail in the life of a man that I had only known through his columns.<br />Like most of us, Mike had some serious shortcomings (what appears to have been a serious alcohol problem stands out as number one).  He also had a heart and drive for perfection that made his column so great, and (probably) his private life so sad.  The `daily demon,' and the inability to settle for less made him the best columnist of his generation.<br />This book was obviously written by an admirer.  Perhaps someday there will be a more objective biography.  For today if you want to understand Chicago in the last half of the twentieth century this book and a collection of Mike Royko's columns is a good place to start.	2002-04-15

This book is an attempt to take us back to those days when the whole concept of constitutional government was in question, and lead us step by step through the major cases that brought us to what has become an almost universal understanding of what the document is even if we disagree about how it should be read.<br />Mr. Simon's book is very accessible to a layman, with the historic and legal detail required to understand what is at risk.  Anyone who has approached a political science, American history, or business law course has read about Marbury v. Madison.  I don't know how many have gone farther.  This book takes us further outlining a series of critical cases that a masterful legal mind, and I would add a masterful politician, used to establish the constitution as the supreme law of the land.<br />To me today, it is simple fact.  Most of us believe that the constitution is the supreme law of the land, whether we agree on what it says, or how it should be interpreted.  These two men sincerely disagreed.  Thomas Jefferson argued that state constitutions and the federal constitution were co-equal documents.  That basically a state constitution could override the federal constitution.  John Marshall argued that the federal constitution, if it was to mean anything at all, had to be supreme.  This fight went on all their lives, and this book outlines how Marshall won.  It also points out that victory is always in doubt, and may yet turn out to be temporary.<br />My only complaint, given the recent revelations of historians' plagiarism, is the book's `new' format isolating notes and references to back pages rather than the `old' page-by-page footnote structure.  Given the value of the content, and the view from inside the battles that made our country what it is, it's a shortcoming worth suffering through.	2002-04-09

And that is not the reason to buy the book.<br />The book really worth buying because of the classic illustration's by Dore.  They are fantastic.  They perfectly catch the tone of the poem.  In a time before movies, animated cartoons, or TV, these illustrations showed the poem that was being read (probably out loud by an adult).  They worked then.

Steinbeck is one of those people.  This book presents some of his best work.  It also shows a change in the times and the man.  Steinbeck's time, at least the time he addressed in his best writing was the depression, World War II, and some of the fifties.  Unfortunately, he did not quit then, and some of his later work is the writing of a man grown disillusioned and sad. <br />This book takes us through many years, and many places.  Much of it is well known.  It's really great when the topic is a personal friend, or an unsuspecting stranger (the article written after the death of Ed Ricketts, or the article about a French village in the Alps shortly after World War II).  It gives a consistent voice to the views of one man and his reaction to the world around him. Much of it has been popular from time to time, and much of it has always been unpopular with a certain group of people.  It would be easier to pick out the `good' from the `bad' is they were arranged chronologically, but they are not.  If you are a fan of good writing, the whole book is `good.'  If you want to admire what Lee (in East of Eden) called `clean thinking' skip the end.  By the time I got to the middle of `America and Americans' (about the last quarter of the book) it was getting old, and frankly I love Steinbeck's fiction so much that I could not finish it.  By that time, it had become a litany of the complaints of my father, and the music was gone.  <br />Critics argue about how great a writer Steinbeck was. One of their greatest criticisms was that he was too popular, or that he wrote for a popular following.  That may be a valid criticism, and it may be one of the best reasons for reading his work.  Which ever it is for you, it is here in abundance.  The intimate details, the exacting prose, and the popular viewpoint.  Whatever else we think, there is a Steinbeck voice thatis unique, and worthy.<br />The strongest point in Steinbeck's writing is the sense of place.  This book of non-fiction presents the land and the people. The real people and places who became Joad's, or Trask's, or sheriff's, are here in vivid detail.  The Salinas of his youth, New York, France, Italy, traffic in Rome, and seaside villages are all vivid and inviting.<br />If you have read \\"The Harvest Gypsies\\" \\"The Log From the Sea of Cortez\\" \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"East of Eden\\" many of the things in here will be familiar. If you have not, read this book. It may make them more appealing.	2002-03-04

It used to be that you either read this book before or after you read the Silmarillion and the Hobbit.  Now it will also be either before or after you've seen the movies which you saw before or after you read the Silmarillion and the Hobbit.  However you arrive you will not be disappointed.  If you come from 'The Hobbit' it continues the story of the One Ring as it passes from Bilbo to Frodo, and as they, Gandalf, and the world become more aware of what has happened and what the ring really means.  While reading this book you'll hear clues to many other, older, stories and myths of ages gone by (the three ages of Middle Earth) and at first you'll pass over them, and you'll enjoy the adventure of Frodo and the fellowship facing their collective and individual destinies.<br />If, however, you read the Silmarillion before reading this book, you'll immediately recognize people, places, and things that carry a much greater history, which can add greatly to your enjoyment.  The meaning of places and items encountered will carry the wealth of meaning associated with mythology in our literature.  It has been said that these stories all grew out of Tolkien's attempt to invent a language, and his awareness that you can't invent a language without inventing a mythology and history to go along with it.<br />Another option is to read all of them several times, and the good news is that they hold up.  These books are all good enough to be enjoyed with several readings.  Which leads to the further temptation of all those other Middle Earth books that Christopher Tolkien has been editing.<br />For now, if you're just starting, start with 'The Hobbit', it's an easy read, it introduces many characters that are referenced in 'The Lord Of The Rings' and gives you a general introduction to the land and people of Middle Earth.  Then 'The Lord of The Rings'.  As much as you may like to read just one, the three all go together and they are a compelling tale.  Then, if you really want to know more about those characters, and the history that precedes them, The Silmarillion.  By that time you'll be a true fan and can decide on your own whether to go back to the beginning or on through all the other bits and pieces that are being discovered.<br />This is a really rich fable.  It's been written out of a deep love of language, literature, history, and religion,  and the more you read the more you'll wonder about the mind that could invent it, and the man that would keep working on it for so long without passing it on.<br />There is a great love here and bit of it rubbs off on each of us while reading it.ree all go together and they are a compelling tale.

Why?  I don't know.  It's not great literature.  It is nothing like his later works, written after he matured in ways that he would never have expected when this was written.  It is an 'immature' book.  He's reported to have said later in life that he wished he had never written it.  But he did, and it's a good thing.<br />It gives us a starting point.  Other contemplatives probably went through many of these feelings, but not many of them wrote at this point in their lives.  Merton talked later about the irony of forsaking all possessions in the morning, and signing the publishing contract for this book in the afternoon.  That tension stands out here.  The man stands in two worlds. One (his past) that he has rejected, but can not let go of, and the other that he needs (is there any other reason for becoming a monk?), but hasn't grown into.<br />This is his story.  It's not the story of a monk.  It's not the story of a secular man.  It's the story of a man who was to become one of the most influential monks of the century, almost in spite of himself, but he wasn't there yet.  He's still new, caught up in bliss, not yet aware of the things that come with the life he had chosen (or had chosen him, if you want to say it that way).<br />As I said, it is a hard book to rate.  There are times in a sincere man's life when it is going to speak to something within him.  If it does, this could be one of the most interesting things he will ever read.	2001-11-14

But don't let that keep you from a very interesting story that combines history, academic politics, and (oh but the way) murder.<br />Who really discovered the continent? and when did it happen?<br />More interestingly, what happens when an academic disagrees with the prevailing thought about that, and says so, and thinks he can prove it?  As it turns out, there are two different people, about fifty years apart, who come up with the same 'alternative explanation.'<br />All it takes to complete the story is the discovery of a body of too recent vintage during an archeological dig, the delay caused by the police, and an old bum living in a shack in the area who may or ma not have the answer to both mysteries.<br />If you like history, or if you like mysteries, you'll like this book.	2001-11-05

There are books that help us do that.  This is one of those books.<br />This book gives us a chance to experience the education, interaction, and growth of some of the most important men behind the ideas that shaped our country over the past century. These men believed what they believed was important, and they believed that what others had to say was important, and the result set a course for the country for a long time.<br />For a short period three men (Oliver Wendell Holmes, William James, and Charles Sanders Peirce) along with others were part of a discussion group that gives the book its name.  The book covers many more men, and a much longer period, but continually revolves around these three, returning repeatedly to them and their influence on each other, and through them to the world around them.<br />That many men are going to find it impossible to agree all the time, and in fact it is their dealing with the differences that contributes the most to the future, as well as the narrative of the book.  When they start to contemplate the place of conflicting ideas, conflicting beliefs, and conflicting ideas of what free speech means in our democracy you know this book is carrying us onto a road we seldom travel in popular literature.<br />This book traces men, their ideas, and the results from before the Civil War (what did everyone in the North really want from abolition? and what did they really think about race relations?) through the 'club' to the Supreme Court decision in U.S. vs. Abrams in 1919. A group of important men in an important time, and a very important idea that demands our attention now more than ever.	2001-11-02

That could be why Warren Buffet suggested going back to the original if you want to know what value investing is all about.<br />Current investment practice, and later editions of this book concentrate on the one thing that Graham said was, if not impossible, very non-productive - estimating future earnings.  This book concentrates on understanding proven value.  Where one spends most of its time on the income statement, this book spends most of its time on the balance sheet.  There is a world of difference, and the difference leads to a much different portfolio, and future.<br />There is, as the author points out repeatedly, a difference between investment and speculation.  There is also a difference between helpful discussion and meaningful analysis.  The original edition is full of meaning, written by a practitioner who also could teach.  Later editions (especially the fifth) make me wonder how much of the master's works the new authors read before starting.  It also makes me question how much influence Donaldson, Lufkin, & Jenrette and Autanet exercised in return for their grant to finance the book.<br />If you want a great book on investing read the original.

But this book can at least stake a valid claim on the title.<br />How many books skillfully include a whole continent, a major war, the author's religious and philosophical beliefs, and some of the most clearly defined characters in literature into one piece of work?  It is impossible to read this book and not learn something meaningful about Russian society in Tolstoy's time.  It is also not possible to read this book and not know Natasha, Andrey, Pierre, Helen, and Marya.  The great things is that we also know Denisov, The Old Prince Bolkonsky, the Old Count and Countess Rustov, Kuragin, Alexander, Napoleon, and most importantly we even know Platon Karataev well.<br />A major mark of the greatness of the book, and one of the many reasons it has survived so long, is that throughout the many twists and turns of history during the period covered, and the major life changing events that happen to the fictional characters so gracefully woven into the fabric of the history (or is the history woven into the fabric of the story?) nothing really surprises.  At no time do we, as readers, have to say, &quot;Why would he do that?&quot;  At the same time the preparation is not obvious.  We don't know why we were ready for that major (or minor) event, but we were.<br />The main characters move from youth through experience to understanding and/or death naturally.  We know why they did it.  The interjected discussions of history, philosophy, and religion pace us, give us time to consider the times and the people and why this goes beyond simple story to an expression of Russian character.  And it was all accomplished under the strictest censorship.<br />Like all great books, this one still provides enjoyment and enlightenment after several readings.  It is obviously not light reading.  It is very worthwhile reading.<br />Since this book is written in what for me is a foreign language, another major consideration is the translator, and as far as I am concerned there is none better than Constance Garnett.  She brings a value to the language of the book that is not matched in any other translations that I have attempted.  My second recommendation, especially if your history is a bit rusty, is the Inner Sanctum Edition (translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude) that is extensively footnoted and includes several illustrations that make it a bit easier to follow the descriptions of some of the battles.<br />Finally, don't read this book because it is one of the great books of literature.  Read it because it is a fantastic story about a time, place, a people, and characters worth getting to know.ideration is the translator, and as far as I am concerned there is none better than Constance Garnett.

Few tales are better than the classic trip of discovery. Maybe Homer's epic poems started it, more likely it started long before him, a time so old that everything can be both true and not quite true, and men and Gods are interchangeable. This is one of those stories. A quiet Hobbit (Bilbo) lives comfortably (as Hobbits are prone to do), when a Wizard named Gandalf knocks on his door (as wizards frequently do in these kinds of stories). Much to his surprise, Bilbo is soon off on an adventure.<br />Adventures, the things found out (and things found) do two things. They change the adventurer and they change the world around. This adventure does both.  The quiet, shy, Bilbo becomes the leader of the adventure (much to his dismay), and as happens in good fantasy adventure stories, the changes have much more far reaching consequences than anyone (even Gandalf) could predict, and then there is the ring tha he finds accidentally while trying to escape from the trolls (but then that is the stuff of many later books).<br />The people of Middle Earth, the trials and tribulations the world since the end of the 'good old days', the trials of the adventurer, and hints of the impact on the rest of the world are wonderfully described in a style that appeals to young and old alike. This is a story in the best story telling tradition. It's fun, it's easy to read, and it's a classic tale of adventure and growth. I'm only sorry I waited so long to read it!!	2000-08-14

Peek into the  relationship between a great writer and his publisher.

Nominally set in Steinbeck's beloved California  hills, it has many parts that forcast the writing that would come later in  &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;, or more directly &quot;East of  Eden&quot;.<br />The characters, the story, the ending, are so obviously  metephorical that you know they are more than just people.  At the same  time, the story on it's face is worth reading several times.  It speaks to  many themes that run throughout our lives, and at least for me caused a  great deal of thought.<br />What more can you ask from a book?	2000-08-03

From the first published writing that marked him as a talent too good to ignore, through  his religious conversion, and his soul-searching conclusions.<br />Some of his  greatest short works are here.  &quot;The Recollections of a  Billiard-Marker&quot; is one of the early writings, and one of the bet  descriptions of the effects of addiction (in this case an addiction to  gambling) I have ever read.  The Sevestopol Sketches (there are three of  them) give one of the closest descriptions of men in war possible (the  defense of Sevestopol during the Crimean War, which fell to the British and  French).  A group of religious parables.  &quot;The Death of Ivan  Ilyitch&quot; is a fantastic description of the internal battles waged when  fighting with death.  And &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; is a discussion  of the place of men and women in society that should be required reading by  anyone who thinks they understand the opposite sex.<br />There is enough in  these stories to give the reader a chance to understand the author before  attacking the larger and more famous major works.	2000-08-01

Year one brought the good news (people know him, he is special, and he can thrive in the other world).  Year two has  more lessons.  First there's the warning that he should not return to  school, that it is dangerous.  Then the problems start, and the insights  start.<br />Harry learns more about his father (don't we all have to do  that?), rescues his friends, and also learns what it feel like to be  suspected as classmates are attacked and he becomes the main suspect of  many around him.  Again, Harry holds fast, deals with the problems as they  present themselves, and of course triumphs in the end after several close  calls.<br />This book, like its predecessor, is a wonderful tale written for  the modern child by an author with a wonderful sense of fancy.	2000-08-01

This book starts at that age when we all know (knew) we are obviously in the wrong family.  Harry's  doesn't have Cinderella's wicked stepmother, but he does have a terrible  aunt, uncle, and cousin, and a bed in the closet under the  stairs.<br />Harry's rescuer, the giant Hagrid (rather than a pixie  Tinkerbelle) lets Harry know what we all want to hear.  Not only is this  not his family, but Harry is special.  In fact it seems that everyone  except Harry knows how special he is, and the circumstances that brought  him to the Dursley's house in the first place.<br />Like all good fairy tales,  Harry must leave home, overcome his own lack of knowledge, learn who to  trust, who not to trust, learn about himself, and earn the right to come  home again.  Who but J. K. Rowling has ever had this happen in the setting  of a school, and have it be so much fun.<br />It's a beautiful tale, along the  lines of the best fairy tales.  It has to encourage children to look  forward to some new kind of education.  And it has a story line that keeps  you reading once you start.  Read it to your younger children, let your  older children read it for themselves.  And all of you -- enjoy it.	2000-07-31

Wasn't when this book was written.  Hopefully it never will be.<br />Books about the experience are always good to read.  There is something very  special that goes into the making of a Marine, and this book is one of the  best at covering that story.  If you want to understand what a marine  'Boot' goes through, what his drill instructors go through, and why they  are so proud to have made it, read this book.<br />Larger questions are asked  later on in the book, and are more important.  After you've gone through  this experience through the eyes of the recruit, and the drill instructor,  and The Corps, and have gathered some understanding of what we were taught,  take some time to think about the longer lasting effect.  Think about a  truly volunteer, full time, professional military in our society.  What  does it mean to all us to have a military believe that the 'outside' world  is basically evil?  What will it mean as we allow the military to get more  and more involved in fighting crime?  What does it mean to have, for the  first time in our history, a military that is isolated from the `civilian'  world?  <br />The book makes it clear that the Marine Corps is special, and  shows many of the reasons why.  It lets the rest of the world know why we  are so proud to be Marines, even decades after our active service.  It also  takes the time, if you read through the end, to ask some very important  questions about what it all means.	2000-07-21

This story is great literature.<br />I have read this short  story several times, and am amazed at how much changes each time I read  it.<br />A simple plot.  A successful judge, moving &quot;up the ladder&quot;  (as we all aspire to), has what turns out to be a fatal accident.  Over the  next few months his health deteriorates and as he suffers he (and each of  us as readers) is forced to see himself and the people in his life through  a different lens.  Slowly he has to grapple with THE great questions:  What  is life about?  Has my life been worthwhile?<br />The structure is superb.  By  giving us the story in the sequence he does, Tolstoy forces us to see his  point, without being `preachy' or pedantic.  The gentle touch of a genius.	2000-07-20

Forester in 1927, may be a little hard to acquire, but it is written in a style that is easy to read and understand, and with a style that tempts you  to read it many times.<br />The idea is simple.  Imagine all the novelists  sitting in a room, each with a pen in hand.  As we look over their  shoulders what do we see? A story, something that keeps you wanting to know  'What happens next'.  What gets added to that to make a great novel?   People, Plot, Fantasy, Prophecy, Pattern and Rhythm are the words Forester  uses to discuss the various aspects.  Always with a sense of humor, and a  loving understanding of his craft, and specific examples from novels  written by those writers in that room.<br />This book it worth studying for an  understanding of literature, it is also reading for an understanding of  this particular novelist and what he believes is important in those books  we all love.	2000-07-14

There's a tremendous  growth, and tremendous change.<br />If you want to know about all of these  things, this is the book for you.  If you want a quick recap of the trial  that forms the &quot;backbone&quot; of the book, this is not the book.  You  will, from time to time, get frustrated by the side tracks, you will wonder  why there is so much here about other things.  If you stick with it, you  will come away understanding many of the forces that led to the  'Progressive' reforms a couple decades later, and you will meet many very  interesting people along the way.<br />Stick with it...

A philosophic treatise, perhaps. Above all, a well written novel in the tradition of great literature.<br />This is a book that I had to read over and over, and that still made me think with the tenth reading. Some of the book is biographical, the story of Steinbeck's Irish Presbyterian family especially his grandfather's move into the Valley around Salinas and his struggle to raise a family on the marginal land available when he arrived.<br />The fictional characters are the story, and the land is the story, and they are done masterfully.  Is he trying to tell a story, yes of course he is.  Is there an underlying theme, there is, and it is obvious.  Does he have a moral viewpoint?  he sure does, and this book is trying to sell it.  Is there a compelling, well written story around them to tie it all together, you bet!<br />Adam Trask, his brother Charles, Adam's son Aron, and his brother Cal.  As everyone points out, the A's and C's.  The story 'as old as man', the story of Cain and Able, of competition, rejection and revenge, first through Abel's eyes, then through Cain's.  And there's enough explicit dialog to insure that you see that.<br />That story is impossible to tell without support, and an outsider.  Support through Lee, the Chinese-American cook/philosopher looking for his own history.  The outsider, Sam Hamilton (Steinbeck's grandfather), poor where Adam is rich, rich in 'soul' where Adam is poor.<br />All this brought together by a strong narrative written by a man attempting to write his masterpiece. He accomplished his goal.  And when the world wouldn't see it, he quit writing fiction.  It's a shame.	2000-02-18

Synge's book about life on the desolate Aran Islands is a very well written look into a society that could only exist until that time, and in that place. The Aran Islands, a group of islands off the west coast of Ireland, were at the time almost completely cut off from the mainland, except via the 'hooker' and the skin covered 'curagh' that plays such a critical part both in life on the islands, and in the book.  Life there was very hard and made the character of the prople very unique.  The islands were, and are, one of the strongest 'Irish' speaking cultures, and the ability to find life in the midst of it all is profoundly apparent throughout the book, as is Synge's obvious appreciation of the simple life and simple beliefs found there (note the comparison he makes to the 'busy' and 'lost' world in Galway, merely across the bay).
