I have read a few books on crystal healing, but I was very sceptacle about putting crystals on my chakras, especially after Edgar Cayce (the Sleeping Prophet) warned people against this saying that it's dangerous. This book is THE book to get for safe instructions. Crystals are nothing to mess with if you're not sure what you're doing.	2004-06-09

I have read 11 &quot;Edgar Cayce&quot; books, but &quot;Many Mansions&quot; is the MOST thought provoking book of them all! It'll make you think twice before harming anyone. It'll make you think about your own lfe, and why people suffer in different ways, and the whole purpose of life in general. This is DEFINATELY a MUST READ!	2004-06-04

I've read other pendulum books before, but this one takes the cake. It tells you how to work the pendulum, and things things you should do if the pendulum is not swinging. There are many pendulum healing techniques  you can use, even with crystals. There are many, many pendulum charts that he provides you with for asking questions, even crystal charts containing over 100 different crystals. There is a lot this book has to offer. You'll definately get your moneys worth. Buy this Book! I highly recommend it!	2004-05-18

Even if it sounds annoying to some who are not very religious (there is nothing wrong with that, whatever floats your boat), but it doesn't hurt to say a short prayer. The only thing I don't like about his tape is that the mediation is kind of short. Maybe because it's geared to beginners. But I definately would recommend this tape to anyone. I would also recommend, &quot;Guided Meditations For Calmness, Awareness and love&quot; by Bodhipaksa.	2004-05-17

This book does not talk about crystal healing, or pendulum healing, or any of the sort. This book goes back to the Source of all things, which is God. Using God's Power to heal others as well as yourself. This is a well written book with plenty of Mr. Cayce's readings about Jesus Christ, and how He healed many people through His attunement with God. This book is very short (106 pages) and straight to the point (no dragging). It discusses the effects of group prayer, how healing could help others who truely believe (not just the healer), how to meditate using The Lord's Prayer, precautions in healing, and the list goes on. Yes, this is a must have!	2004-05-17

Being a Biologist and a Christian, that to me was the most important factor. I highly recommemd this book! It is obvious that there was a lot of hard work and time put into these findings. So, anyone interested in learning more about Atlantis should read this book!	2004-05-10

I told myself that I wouldn't read anymore Egar Cayce books until I've read his life story. I'm still reading Edgar Cayce books after reading, &quot;There is a River...&quot; and now I appreciate his books much more now that I know who the individual is. This book is very in depth, but there are some questions that I have that remain unanswered about his life. Perhaps I'll get more info from the book, &quot;Edgar Cayce: An American Prophet&quot;. What I love about Mr. Cayce is that through the whole book, no matter how much fame he got, or how many people looked up to him, he always stayed humble and close to the Bible, which says a lot compared to some psychics that become arrogant just because they have stronger psychic ability than most people. He used his ability not to get rich, but to help people even though he was poor himself. God bless is soul!	2004-04-30

For spiritual people who feel confused about the act of having sex while on a spiritual path, well, relax! This book is the book you definately need to read. Mr. Cayce does not condemn anyone, or says anything like, \\"sex is bad or dirty\\", nor does he judge anyone. This book deals with many different areas of sexuality including marriages, cheating, homosexuality, masterbation, and the list goes on. Read it, you'll like it! Enjoy!	2004-04-22

This kit is a good start for anyone who wants to learn dowsing techniques. It's an easy read, and great for beginners, but don't stop here, read other books that can expand your knowledge like the \\"Pendulum Healing Handbook\\" and \\"Pendulum Power\\". The only things I don't like about this book is that I object at the fact that you should tell the pendulum what is \\"yes\\" and what is \\"no\\", because that involves your conscious, and I think in any work involving subtle energies, you should put your conscious aside, and let the Spirit from within guide your pendulum. i.e. you ask the pendumlum what it considers \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\". Also, this book is not the greatest at explaining what should happen if your pendulum does not move. I'm currently in the midst of reading, \\"Pendulum Healing Book\\", and that book gives better explanations. However, I still think this is a great book, and it comes with a durable pendulum. Enjoy!	2004-04-16

I chose this book because I don't like anything satanic (which many runes books protray), and I don't want a &quot;watered-down&quot; version either, so I figured this would be my best bet. It has great pictures, many interpretations of the runes, the history behind it (because I think that's very important).

I am one who has been paying attention to, and interpreting my own dreams since I was a kid, however, there are some dreams that I still need help understanding. I had a difficult time chosing a good dream dictionary due to the fact that many dream dictionaries have narrow meanings for their symbologies. However, this book gives you the point of views of Sigmond Freud, Carl Jung, the interpretations of other cultures and esoteric symbologies. So, it gives you a broad view of each symbol.

Although this book does does not contain as much info and color pictures as Judy Hall's crystal books (&quot;The Illustrated Guide to Crystals&quot; and &quot;The Crystal Bible&quot;), the combination of the three is a must! Cayce's book not only contains info on stones, but how colors, planets, months and also minerals relate. Since Edgar Cayce is one of the most well known psychics, it's good to get his views on crystals. There are many Cayce readings in this book also. It was a good help to me! Hope you enjoy!	2004-04-14

There is not a lot of info, but enough. I like it because it was written by Mr. Cayce himself, which made me fell like he was talking to me. He does state that those who don't see auras are usually not aware that they can, and that many people see auras, it's not uncommon, you just have to relax and be more aware of it. I like this book!	2004-03-18

One of my favorites was &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot; by Steven Covey, which was great! But, &quot;The Edgar Cayce Primer&quot; takes the cake! Many self transformation books talk about how to deal with life situations on the physical plain, but very few books go back to the Source or the Root of all creation. This book is very repetitve on the subjects of &quot;Oneness&quot; and the first two most important Commandments, which I think, is a good thing because this book stresses these points showing the reader that this is the only way to self-fulfillment, coming out of living in darkness, loving yourself, spiritual strength. I could go on forever about how this book is changining and continually changes my life.	2004-03-17

As previous reveiws have stated, this book is full of beautiful pictures of crystals and healing layouts. The author also goes into the backgroud of how crystals are formed, and their molecular strucure, and the properties they have that make them useful for healing.  He also goes into some safety precautions about how to use the crystals for healing (so that no one gets hurt). I would definately recommend this book, I think the best crystal books are the ones with the pretty, colorful pictures, it makes it that much more interesting. I recommend this book along with &quot;the illustrated guide to crystals&quot; (or &quot;the crystal bible&quot;) to get aquainted with all the different crystals and their usages.&quot;the crystal wisdom kit&quot; would also be another good investment if you want to start working with crystals.

There are fun excercise at the end of some chapters, which helps you get better aquainted with the signs, planets, reading birth charts, etc. I highly recommend you have your birth chart before buying this book so that you can follow along, and learn how to interpret it. After reading this book, to take it up a notch, I highly recommend, &quot;Spiritual Astrology&quot; by Jan Spiller and Karen McCoy for those who are on a spiritual journey. Happy reading!	2004-03-01

I have to say, the pictures on the cards are BEAUTIFUL and BREATH TAKING! You'll definately be captivated by these pictures. However, I'm VERY dissapointed with the quality of the cards, they are so thin, and easily bendable. These cards will not stand a chance of being use over a period of many years, in other words, they are not very durable, but maybe they will last if they're used gently, but I could deal with that. What I can't deal with is the fact that the authors changed the universal meanings of the some of the cards, which makes me feel that if I use these cards, I have to learn the meanings all over agian, which sucks! My final word is, I look at these cards, and I say to myself, &quot;It is TOO BAD! Such beautiful cards, why did they have to ruin it by re-creating the meanings of some of these cards, and the cards having suc poor quality?!&quot;. Again, If these cards even kept the same meanings, I would see past the poor quality, and would definately give the ratings 5 stars, it angers me that I can't do that! That's how beautiful these pictures are. $40 is a lot of money to get poor quality with the wrong meanings. If you can get these cards for at least half the price, then I still say buy 'em! Well, I hope this review helps somebody.	2004-01-13

I just finished reading this book last night, and it totally moved me! This book is such an easy read, and it she keeps you tuned in because her words are so inspiring, and you don't want to put the book down. She makes you realize that you're not alone in this world, and that you have guides that love you and are there to help you. It's almost like taking a course, but on your own time.  She makes you get rid of all your negative energy, and be more aware of yourself and others and your environment. She teahces everything from grounding yourself, meditation, clearing your aura, chakras, the sprits around you, forgiveness, awareness, the pendulum, tarot cards, I-ching, keeping a journal, etc. It is definatley a book I highly recommend! She seemm like a kind person, someone I'd like to meet one day, and get a reading. Her lessons in this book have helped me so much to let go of negatively, ground myself, and listen to my intuition and be more confident in my intuition, and just be more aware of myself and my environment, which are very important steps on the psychic pathway.

This book tells you how to be happy with yourself to survive this crazy world. It's definately do-able, it will make you think about you own life, and learn how to TAKE CONTROL over your life instead of life taking controlling of you. It is the ultimate gift for anyone you love, especially those who feel helpless and hopeless. YOU WILL DEFINATELY BENEFIT FROM THIS BOOK!!!!!

This book will make you really think about about how to treat people. I think the best advice he gave that really hit home for me is to not criticize people, and to know how to be critical without hurting other people. I personally don't have a problem making friends, but I think we all (whether popular or not) should (from time-to-time) brush up on our people skills, it doesn't hurt, it's a process of growing. He uses a lot of historical characters to make his points clear, so those who like a little history can also benefit from this book.  However, I also highly recommend, &quot;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&quot; by Stephen Covey, the combination of the two will definately be effective. Happy reading!	2003-12-17

I belive that it is good to read books about the tarot to give you some informative insight as a beginner, but it sticks better when you have a workbook, especially as in-depth as this one. Mary Greer touches on, if not everything, then many things you should know about the tarot. Like a reviewer already stated, it's not just about memorizing the cards (which could be very tedious), but learning how to build your own feeling and intuition for the cards, and relating them to your situations in your own life. By the time your done with this book, you will feel much more comfortable with tarot and your intuition relating to your life. I highly recommend this book because not just your regular tarot book, it's more like SERIOUSLY learning something new! I believe that experienced tarot card readers can benifit from this. This book is a challenge, but it's a lot of fun! Before you can read others, you should know how to read your self! I hope I've convinced you! Happy reading!	2003-12-16
