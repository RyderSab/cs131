I felt that it was well written, it moved quickly, and had likable characters.  My only quibble was that, when I was finished with it, I felt that there hadn't been enough interaction between Gillian and Nicholas.  What was there was great.  I liked the premise and have the other trilogy books in my pile to be read.  When I was done, I just felt that there hadn't been enough \\"Him and Her\\".	2005-09-11

I thought he was really intriguing in the previous book he had appeared in.  But, Truly a Wife was a disappointment.  Not enough interaction between Miranda and Daniel and WAY TOO MUCH of the spy stuff.  The spy angle is okay, but a little goes a long way.  There was page after page of it, when I felt the author should be having some interaction between the lead couple.  This story felt rushed.  Daniel is out of commission for most of the book and it just seems that all of a sudden, he realizes he loves her.  The interplay between Griff and Alyssa in the book leading up to this was superior.  Truly a Wife could have been a really good book (because of Daniel and Miranda) if a little more time and editing had been spent on it.	2005-08-22

The point of no return for me was, and this is purely my personal preference, the revelation of Prudence's miscarriage.  Just didn't like it.  I realize how it fit into her life and what made her what she was, but I read it and just went, \\"OHHHHH\\".  This book was 5+ stars up till then, but after that, I just didn't like it as well.  I know I am in the minority here, but like I said--personal preference.	2005-08-19

I won't discuss plot lines as they have been listed before.  Let me tell you what I liked about How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire.  Ms. Sparks has created a whole vampire world--sort of along the lines of Harry Potter and the whole wizarding world.  There is a whole hierarchy and sort of a parallel universe existing right alongside the human one--of course, the humans have had their memories wiped clean, so we don't know about all the vampire stuff.  But, once you read this book, you will know and you will love it.  Shanna is a wonderful heroine, not too spunky and never TSTL.  She has problems in her life and she is going to handle them.  She comes under the protection of what has to be one of the best heroes ever written.  Roman Draganesti is to die for(Ha! Ha!).  He has all kinds of torment and pain and it is great. Watching these two get together had me laughing out loud.  But, there is a depth to Spark's writing.  Roman's background and his abhorence of what he has done were riveting.  I loved reading how he, with Shanna's help, realizes that he is not beyond redemption.  It took this book to a whole new level.  I have read many, many vampire books.  Unfortunately, they ultimately proved unsatisfying.  Not this one.  I can't wait for the next one.  With the cast of characters in this book, (Angus, Laszlo, Gregori, Jean-Luc, Connor, and Ian, to mention a few) Ms. Sparks can keep writing for years.  I am waiting for more on my all-time favorites--kilt wearing, Scottish vampires.  Can there be anything better??	2005-08-18

However, One Night of Sin was a major disappointment.  From the get-go, it failed to capture me.  I really wasn't all that wild about Becky (starting with the name--sounded like one of the servant girls).  I thought maybe Alec might pick it up, but he didn't.  I won't go over the plot.  I will just say that as I read, I started to get an icky feeling.  Maybe it started with them having sex right away.  But it didn't get any better.  The sex scenes were just too much.  I didn't care for them.  They were more explicit than I remember Foleys as being and, to be honest, after a few of them, I started skimming.  I didn't feel a connection with this story.  I was glad when it was over. I had been waiting for this book for quite a while, but it was a big letdown.  I hope she lightens up on the sex the next time or I will have to wait and read the reviews before I waste any more money on her books.  She can tell a riveting story. She doesn't need to rely on the skanky sex as a filler.	2005-08-09

I thought it had potential, but just never came together for me.  I liked Connor and thought Howell did a good job with him.  Maybe what I really don't like is that Gillyanne (and all Howell's heroines) was so tiny.  That was stressed over and over--how tiny she was, almost childlike.  I think that sort of subconsciously icked me out.  Now, romance novel heroines don't have to be Amazons, but I don't like getting a mental picture of a 12 year old.  I think that is what kept happening and prevented me from liking this book very much.  Come on, next time, have your heroine be at least as big as a 15 year old!!	2005-08-09

But, I was so frustrated with Mared, the female lead.  She was so dense.  I may be super critical of the heroines in the books I read, but, come on, she had this hunk (and aren't they all in historical romances) who absolutely adored her and she couldn't decide until almost the very end of the book that she wanted him.  If that had been me, the book would have ended about the 3rd chapter.  It was a no-brainer.  He had money, looks, was crazy about her.  Come on!!  Anyway, it was a very enjoyable read, all that aside.  Mared was funny.  I really liked her spunk and sense of humor.  I have already described my thoughts on Payton. <br /> <br />This was a very well-written book, had interesting characters, and lots of spice.  It also had, unfortunately, a \\"couldn't see the forest for the trees heroine\\".  Ultimately, I give it 4 1/2 stars.  Naturally, the deduction is for that goofy Mared.	2005-08-07

Unfortunately, the story she came up with this time is not excellent.  I have actually not cared for most of her recent books.  I read them, but they don't make an impact on me.  They are so light (with one exception--the one with Francesca--I think) that they become almost trivial.  I am afraid that JQ is sort of going down the Amanda Quick path.  Her earlier books were fantastic, but as her career progressed, she became too clever.  Her heroines were too intelligent, too spunky, and too annoying.  Ultimately, I stopped reading Quick's books.  The characters in It's In His Kiss were not annoying, but I didn't care about them.  I didn't like the way Hyacinth was so energized after her intimate encounters with Gareth.  I just didn't like it.  Gareth could have been really good with a better written heroine. I liked the conflict with his father and felt some of his desperation.  There was just something about Hyacinth that rubbed me wrong.  IMO, Julia Quinn should ease up on the cleverness and just concentrate on developing two lead characters you want to remember.  She certainly has the talent to do it.	2005-07-08

I am a sucker for governessess who fall in love with their unattainable employers and this one fit the bill spectacularly.  I don't usually read Regencies, but this one caught my eye and I'm glad I picked it up.  Esmerelda Fortune, Miss Fortune, is an intelligent woman with a secret wish.  She accepts employment with Julian Armstrong.  In exchange for being governess to his five children, who are a delight, she will have access to his extensive library.  Of course, there is the obligatory heiress he must marry and she is a toad.  Naturally, things resolve themselves quite nicely.  This book is not your typical romance.  There is a healthy dose of reality in the ending that played out just perfectly.  Perfect was a word much used in this book.  I find it just the perfect word to describe my feelings for this book.	2005-07-07

It was a quick read, but I expected more about Erik and Christine.  I should have realized from the reviews that his early life was going to be stressed.  But, after multiple viewings of ALW's wonderful Phantom of the Opera movie, I wanted the majority to be about Erik and Christine.  It was nice to see where Erik came from and what caused him to be the way he was, though.  I just was expecting something else.	2005-04-01

I read the first chapter online and bought the book because of that.  I was pleasantly surprised that this book actually lived up to the promise of that chapter.  I loved the premise of this book and the duke's means of supporting himself.  I remember some of the first books I read were Gothic romances and this book had that feel with the chapters from the book Lynette was reading.  The book I read before this one left a bad taste in my mouth (Lady in Waiting by K. Caskie--I hated that book!!).  But I read TDSS in one sitting.  The characters were all excellent.  When Lynette veered even the slightest toward TSTL status, she was reeled back in quickly.  She was spunky, but not overbearingly so.  I liked her, but I especially liked Ravensfield.  He was yummy.  In Caskie's books, I could never really get a good picture of what the hero looked like, but the way Connie Lane described Ravensfield--I immediately got a picture of Gerard Butler in Phantom, only with two perfect sides to his face.  And, we got to know the story from Ravensfield's POV.  That was what was missing from Lady in Waiting--poor development of the male lead.  The sexual tension between Lynette and Thomas was sizzling and their chemistry was crackling from the start.  This was a great book.  I look forward to more from Ms. Lane.	2005-03-27

I slogged through her first novel and really didn't like it, but, shame on me, I gave in and bought her second.  To my horror, I thought it was even worse than her first.  This heroine, Jenny Penny (lovely name), had no redeeming qualities.  She reminded me of someone and, halfway through the book, I realized who it was.  Elizabeth Bennett's harebrained, selfish sister, Lydia, in Pride and Prejudice.  Like Lydia, Jenny thought of no one but herself.  I have to say her shopping antics wore real thin, real fast.  She could be in the midst of a crisis, but see some pretty in a shop and she had to have it.  That is not an endearing trait in a heroine.  I have to doubt her intelligence because she certainly seemed like she wasn't too blessed in the brains department.  I also don't think she was very honest, witness her deception with Callum (and he's another story).  She never really owned up to who she really was until she was forced to.  I really, really didn't like this character.  The dotty aunts were not as annoying as the last time around, but they were still too eager to go along with the deception.  As for Callum, I question why he was there.  We never really got to know him.  I love to hear what's going on in the hero's head as he is falling in love with the heroine. I felt that Callum was trotted out when Caskie needed a stud and then trotted back to his stable, wherever that was.  How he could put up with Jenny Penny, I'll never know.  Probably because we were never given the opportunity to get his POV.  If I sound upset, I am.  I agree with the other reviewer who thought Caskie was writing down to romance readers.  I get the feeling that she is.  If she wants to write some other genre, then go do that.  You are doing readers a disservice by publishing books of this ilk.  Let the historical romance category to the pros like Lisa Kleypas, Karen Marie Moning, Sabrina Jeffries, and Pamela Britton.  Caskie won't get me again!!	2005-03-24

I loved HID, so I thought I would read this one.  I had put off reading it because I knew that Ellie had a child and I don't usually like heroines with kids.  I was right.  Liam was great.  Julia London writes great male characters, but Ellie came with such baggage!  In HID, Grif and Anna sparred a lot and were great to read about.  In this one, I mostly pitied Liam and wished he could find someone better.  I was left with the feeling that while Ellie did love him, I wasn't sure that she wouldn't put her daughter above him.  Maybe it's just me, but I want the heroine to be devoted wholeheartedly to the leading man and I didn't think she was in this case.	2005-03-19

I thought I would feed my Legolas addiction, but I feel let down.  This book just didn't do it for me.  I didn't like Jane--Charlie seemed to wimp out after a while and I wasn't getting the Legolas feeling as I read.  It was just sort of meh!  I think there was a good book in there somewhere, but it never jumped out at me.  I didn't get the impression that Jane really loved Charlie.  I think she desired him, but love.  I don't know.  Anyway,  I was disappointed.	2005-03-19

I could tell right away that I didn't like Mac.  Don't like women who act like men.  Gavin might have been okay with someone else.

I don't feel that the authors spent much time at all on these stories.  Sandy Blair's was okay, but could have been bulked up a little.  There just wasn't enough there.  I read one of the other ones (I don't remember which one), but I only skimmed through the last one.  It was about a fairy or a wood sprite or something.  Karen Marie Moning does otherworldly stuff far, far better.  I should have just waited until her next book comes out. This book really was a waste of time.	2005-03-18

I hadn't read the previous Highlander book (don't like heroines who have kids, shame on me) so when I picked Highlander in Disguise, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a very fast read.  I couldn't put it down.  Grif, the hero, is yummy.  I loved him.  He was the prototypical hero--manly, but not overly so.  Anna, the heroine, was good too.  I have found that in my favorite romances, the hero is usually the one that makes it a keeper for me.  The girl has to be good, too, but it's the guy who decides it.  Grif did--big time.  He was great.  Anna was okay.  I liked her, and when she did start to veer off into \\"I don't think I'm going to like her\\" territory, London would have her do something that got her back on track for me.  I ended up liking her.  And the verbal exchanges between Anna and Grif were hilarious.  I laughed out loud more than once.  The interplay between Grif and his \\"valet\\" were enjoyable also.  In short, I really liked this book.  I know I will be reading it again, especially before the next book in the series comes out.  It features Grif's sister and it looks like a good one, too.	2005-03-14

Rees was one of the most unappealing heroes ever created and Helene was Ugh!  I couldn't stand either one of them.  I felt they really deserved each other, as opposed to messing two other people up.  I cringed when Helene got hooked up with Mayne.  Now, he was delicious.  I hope his story will be forthcoming.  I actually liked the romance between Tom and Lina better than the main couple.  I don't know what it was, but Rees and Helene just never triggered my imagination.  From the description of Rees, I got a not very appealing image of him.  I think what I really disliked about Helene were her friends.  I am not an Esme fan.  In fact, I think she is one of the worst female characters ever written.  I like my heroines to have some principles and I don't think Esme has any.  I try to never read anything with her in it, so I am sure that colored my impression of this book because she was a prominent figure in it.  This is almost as bad as James' other book about sluts-- A Wild Pursuit.  I hated that one, too.	2005-02-21

I feel that that is what happened in The Care and Feeding of Pirates.  Christopher was to die for.  He was great.  I loved the way he was written, but Honoria left me cold.  I didn't like the way she came across and I never warmed up to her.  I can't put my finger on what I didn't like about her, but maybe it was that I didn't feel she admitted her love for Christopher soon enough.  To be a great book, it has to click on all cylinders and Honoria, for me, bogged this one down.	2005-02-20

The girl masquerading as a man never really appealed to me and I think it went on too long.  I liked Sinclair, but I think he could have been a tad more alpha.  I never got a real good picture of him, either.  I don't think the author described him physically very well.  I always want to get a good picture of the characters in my head and I didn't with him.  So, I just pictured Gerard Butler from Phantom!  One of the themes was that Jo had ruined herself from ever being married, but once it was decided that she would marry Sinclair, she went right along and didn't seem to have any problems.  This book was okay, but the premise didn't really appeal to me, so I was probably a little pickier that usual.  I hope the author writes a straight-forward romance the next time, where the woman is a woman from the get go.	2005-02-11

I think she is a great writer and I have enjoyed her previous books.  This book has been described in length so I will just say I don't like it because of Annabelle.  I thought she was a witch.  She was so hard and unappealing.  I never warmed up to her and couldn't see why Simon wanted her so badly.  She didn't do anything to merit his devotion until the very end and by then, it was too late for me.  I had written her off.  Like I said, I like LK's writing.  She has written some of the most memorable heroes ever.  I think she devoted too much of her time to developing Simon and should have spent a little time making Annabelle a little more likable.	2004-11-04

I can't get past her age.  17 seems awfully young.  Maybe she is older later in the book, but I didn't read enough to see if that is the case.  I know in that time, girls married younger, but I just kept thinking, \\"She's just a kid!\\".  And Connor's habit of calling her wee Becca over and over just annoyed me to no end.  It made him sound like some middle-aged pervert.  It kind of gave me the creeps.  I didn't find it endearing or sweet, simply grating and goofy.  I really wanted to like this book.  The duke disguised as a groom appealed to me, but I think Johanna Lindsey's Man of my Dreams was a far superior and immensely more enjoyable book.	2004-09-17

I looked forward to this book for so long and when I finally got it, I couldn't believe how good it was.  I have been a fan of KMM since her first book.  I loved the fairy element, the time travel, and the fact that the men are all gorgeous.  This book continues her impressive streak.  I won't go over the details of the book.  Other reviewers have done so. I will just say that this is a book to savor.  I took my time reading it.  I re-read Beyond the Highland Mist to re-introduce me to Adam Black before I started this book.  I just finished The Immortal Highlander and I think I will re-read all her books.  KMM is a writer that takes something different(the fae or time travel) and tweaks it enough so that it is different from the other authors out there.  She really makes it seem otherworldly.  In other books(not KMM's), I get the impression that the hero is the same as every other hero in romance novels, but just happens to be one of the Tuatha De.  It's like that element is just slipped in, but doesn't make that much difference.  In KMM's books, it is an integral part and so nicely developed and written that it is just beautiful.  I really enjoy good writing and KMM's books fit the bill.  This one was just wonderful.  I'm already looking forward to the next.  Who will it be about, I wonder?	2004-09-01

I love the idea of unrequited love and thought this started off well.  However, I found that I lost interest in the book, would put it down, then pick it back up.  It actually took me a long time to finish it.  And when I did, I realized that I didn't really like it.  I liked Sally but I wish she had been a little more sparkling.  I know she wasn't supposed to, but she was sort of blah.  I didn't like George starting with his name.  George doesn't conjure up the most romantic of images.  And, I didn't feel he was good hero material.  He wasn't the worst I've read, but he doesn't stand out like some others.  (One of my all-time favorite heroes is Christopher Seeton in A Rose in Winter--aah!)   <br /> <br />I also didn't like the antics of Betsey Johnson.  I felt a little bit like I was reading a dirty book when the author described her encounters with Ebinezer.  And I didn't like it.  It just gave me an icky feeling.   <br /> <br />Well, I am waiting for Karen Marie Moning's The Immortal Highlander to arrive.  She has never disappointed me.  I can't wait to read about Adam Black.

The author was able to push all my buttons.  It started out with that wacky heiress, Audie.  I couldn't stand her.  She was loud, she changed clothes in the car right after she met Quinn, and she had a ton of emotional baggage.  She also had many previous relationships.  If a woman in a book has a lot of men in her past, what's to stop her from having lots more in the future?  I always look at it that way-it doesn't seem to me that the hero is that special.  He's just one in a long line.  Anyway, Quinn was great.  I think instead of wanting to get close to Audie, he would be taking off fast in the opposite direction.  She and her wacky hijinks would wear thin after a while, I am sure.  Anyway, in my opinion, this book( and I refer mainly to Audie) is a stinker.  I had read Take a Chance on Me, but this same author and I loved that book.  The characters in that hit just the right note.  And the little dog in that book, Hairy, was adorable.  His owner, Thomas, was a keeper, too.  Plus, I really liked the heroine, Emma, in that one.  Pass on Audie's antics and pick up Take a Chance on Me.  It's a lot better book.	2004-07-13

I couldn't put this one down.  The characters were so much more appealing and the ghost part was especially heartwarming to read.  The author really did a great job of keeping the characters likable which I felt she missed in Beyond Compare.  I got my copy of Mesmerized at a used bookstore and thought I would skim through it and then re- sell it (I couldn't unload Beyond Compare fast enough!).  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is a great read and will end up on my keeper shelf.	2004-07-13

The reason for my dislike was Lily.  She was so cold.  I couldn't warm up to her at all.  I didn't feel she deserved Avery's love.  It wasn't until the last few pages that she said she would marry him.  I know it was because of her background, but you should be able to feel something for the heroine, sympathy, empathy, or admiration.  I felt none for her.  I thought she was not a good character.  We are all entitled to our opinions.  Most people liked this book.  I didn't.  This book was one of the few Connie Brockway books that I don't have on my keeper shelf.  I'm glad I read it.  Most reviews were glowing.  It just wasn't for me.	2004-07-07

They have been described elsewhere.  Suffice it to say, they all were a pleasure to read.  After not finding many keepers lately, this was one.  It was not a surprise.  I am a fan of all the authors, with the exception of Mia Ryan.  I loved her story in the 1st Lady W., but I didn't like her follow-up book.  But, the other three authors are among my favorites and they didn't disappoint here.  The characters were all likable, and I felt believable.  So, if one was a giggler, I feel she can be forgiven.  The stories are entertaining and worth your time.	2004-05-19

I had a hard time finishing it, but I did.  I hate to give up on a book, so I slogged through it.  The characters were okay.  The hero, Rafe, had a lot of potential, and I actually thought he was quite good.  The heroine, Kyria, struck me as sort of strident and snippy.  I really didn't like her.  I realize she was the &quot;Goddess&quot;, but I felt she was just rather unlikable.  I found myself skipping through the mystery parts to get to the romance.  The mystery, while well written, was just not interesting to me.  I usually like Candace Camp's work.  In this instance, I felt she slipped into the later(and not necessarily better) Amanda Quick mold and gave up the romance for the madcap adventure bit.  For me, it didn't work.	2004-04-26

I enjoyed a previous book by this author.  But, shortly after beginning this book, I started to get a bad feeling.  I feel that it went too long with Marshall only wanting Evelyn as a mistress.  In other books with the same premise, (and I can't think of a good example right now), it didn't go clear until the end before the hero realized he loved his mistress.  I don't enjoy books such as this one where there is only a physical bond.  I know he did wonderful things for Evelyn, but Marshall never looked at her as a future wife until the end.  I know this book has received high marks so many people have enjoyed it.  I may just be too fussy and picky, but I felt Evelyn was a victim and had to be too grateful to her rescuer.  I guess I should stick to books where the two leads are a little more equal in status.  It might leave a better taste in my mouth.	2004-04-16
US	49413252	R1QTDSG40NR7HU	0843941197	773973576	Lord Savage	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Nice surprise!!	I had wanted to read this book for a while, but just never picked it up.  I finally did and was very glad I had done so.  It was great.  I haven't read too many books lately that are keepers for me, but this one was.  The characters were well-developed and, more importantly, likable.  Ash was a terrific hero--his vulnerability along with his gunslinger toughness was very appealing.  Elizabeth was maybe just a tad too reserved, but she was very easy to like.  There wasn't anything new in this book, but the way it was written kept me reading until I had finished.  It was very fast-paced and exciting.  As I said, I haven't found too many keepers lately, but this one fit the bill.  So many times I start a book with high hopes that it will be good, but something happens to let me down.  That didn't happen with Lord Savage.  I have read a lot of Debra Dier, but I think I'll look up some I haven't gotten to yet.	2004-04-13

The main characters, Abby and Spencer, truly were likable.  Too often in romance novels, one or other of the leads is likable, but the other is just so-so.  Not in this case.  They both were instantly likable.  Abby is an American with a questionable pedigree.  Spencer has a problem which keeps him from wanting to get married, but this problem wasn't overdone or unrealistic.  I won't give spoilers, but this book moves along quickly, has some really funny secondary characters, and comes to a believable and satisfactory conclusion.  I have always read Sabrina Jeffries.  The Pirate Lord is one of my all-time favorites and Married to the Viscount is a keeper, also.  Characters from the last book are mentioned and it was nice to see them again.  All in all, this was an excellent book that was hard to put down.	2004-01-28

The hero(and I use that term loosely) sort of creeped me out.  Some of the stuff that happened between he and the heroine was when she was 13!  He just wasn't hero material.  Brand just seemed concerned with what he wanted.  Charlotte was sort of weak, too.  I loved Too Wicked to Wed.  That book had excellent characters and didn't leave me feeling yucky.  I hope Dawson Smith's next novel harkens back to her earlier, better ones.	2004-01-04

THey seemed sort of flat.  Raine was okay, but Favor just didn't click.  Maybe it was the mood I was in when I read it, but it was sort of boring.	2004-01-04
US	49413252	R131MTTBA2SVMI	006051969X	448727659	The Duchess Diaries	Books	1	4	6	N	Y	A real disappointment	When I read the Lady Whistledown anthology, Mia Ryan's story was my favorite and I waited anxiously for The Duchess Diaries.  What a disappointment.  I eagerly began reading the book, but immediately disliked Lady Lara.  What a goof!.  I just couldn't warm up to her and her half-witted adventures.  I started reading the book, then as it went on, I began skimming, and finally, I put it down.  I think I could have liked Griff, but what did he see in her?  He was an idiot for not looking for someone else.  So,  I haven't found many keepers lately, and this surely isn't one.	2003-12-05

She makes her SEALs larger than life, with descriptions that make them step off the pages(I wish!). Unfortunately, many times her female characters are not so well defined.  In this book, I didn't even find her female lead likable.  I found Joan strident and too coarse.  It is a personal preference, I know, but, I prefer heroines who are a little more ladylike.  Joan didn't sound like a prize.  I got a mental picture of someone who was not too attractive and I kept wondering why: #1-- Mike Muldoon would even look at her and #2-- why she didn't grab him and run. I mean-would you let someone like Mike marry you and then live on another coast?  It seems like her whole family was out west.  Her job was back east.  Let's see--the president or Mike?  The president or Mike?  For her, it should have been an easy choice. I think authors really have to watch their descriptions.  I really couldn't picture her as halfway attractive and being capable of knocking Mike off his feet.<br />Brockmann's men are always tremendous.  The humor in her books is good and she keeps the excitement level high.  I enjoyed reading about her other characters and liked Charlie and Vince's story.  I thought Joan's brother was another reason Mike should have run far, far away from Joan! I really liked and was drawn into Mary Lou's story.  I hope it turns out good for her.  Can't say the same about Sam.  She could skip his story.  I didn't care for him in this book at all.<br />Bottom line--I love Suzanne Brockmann's descriptions of Navy SEAL lives and loves.  She makes those SEALs sizzle.  Unfortunately, the female heroine in Into the Night almost deep-sixed this book.	2003-04-14

But, when I started reading, I found myself putting it down, then picking it up and reading some more.  Finally,I realized I wasn't enjoying this book and really didn't even like it.  So, I put it down for good.  My problem was I didn't like the heroine.  I'm not sure what it was, but she never really clicked with me.  Peter maybe would have been all right with a different female counterpart.  I read one of the author's other books and I remember I didn't care for it either.	2003-04-07
US	49413252	RIHLRVER9A1RM	0440212308	442017075	Lions and Lace	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Do you have more stars?	This is my absolute all-time favorite romance.  I read it once a year and have recommended it to others.  The characters are all terrific and the writing is excellent.  I liked the scenes in Newport because that is a favorite spot of mine.  It is not used in romances very often.  {At least not this well, anyway}.  Trevor is not your typical hero.  He doesn't talk about his love, but you know he will do anything to take care of those he loves.  Lions and Lace, along with A Rose in Winter and Man of my Dreams are the three books I read and reread.  They are the examples of their respective author's best romances.	2003-03-31

Christina Dodd is an automatic buy for me, but I have to say I was disappointed with this book.  I just didn't like the heroine, Madeline.  I never warmed up to her.  She seemed spoiled and shrewish and I don't think she deserved the hero. Dodd's characters are usually so likable and really pull you into the book.  I enjoyed all of her books that I have read, especially the anthology Once Upon a Pillow.  I will read Dodd again and am looking forward to the next book with Eleanor and Mr. Knight.  I just hope she is more likable than Madeline de Lacy!	2003-03-30

It was great!  I closed it when I was finished and just sighed.  The characters were wonderful.  I feel that the secondary characters, a lot of times, can make or break a book, and Ren's ex-wife and her family were good.  The whole cast of characters were people I wanted to read about, not skip over.  I have read all of SEP books and I would have to rank this one at the top.  I especially enjoyed Isabel's moral character.  I love romance novels, but as a Christian, a lot of times I am a little disappointed in the morality in some books.  Not in this one.  I, unlike some other reviewers, appreciated the fact that Isabel prayed.  At least she acknowledged a higher power.  In a lot of books that is never even mentioned. Most of the reviewers liked this book (except one, and I don't know what book she read!!) and they liked Isabel and Ren.  Well, her praying was what made her the kind of person she was.  So, for a great book, pick this one up.  You're guaranteed to like it.	2002-06-29
US	49413252	RHH69PKDYXAM9	0821767860	562284006	Thoroughly Kissed (Zebra Contemporary Romance)	Books	2	5	12	N	N	thoroughly disappointed	I thought this book had a really great premise.  But, I wasn't into the book very far when I began to jump ahead looking for the romance.  I thought the idea of the Professors Lost and Found was tremendous, but, for me, it never panned out.  Out heroine spent more time with her cat and more pages were devoted to it than to Michael.  I realize Emma was afraid to risk kissing, but on the whole, I was really disappointed.  I felt the book could have been a whole lot better.  I just didn't like it.  Of course, that is just my opinion, but I feel the author squandered a really good plot by not devoting a little more attention to the romance between the lead characters.  I realize not every romance has to be filled with a lot of overt passion to be a good book, but after reading this, I sort of feel like I read a book about witches and magic with a little(very little!) romance thrown in.	2001-03-26
