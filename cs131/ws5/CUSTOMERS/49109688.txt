US	49109688	R3SQ5MA4S6CSOC	0201615835	853053436	Enterprise Application Integration	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Good survey of pre-web services EAI	Linthicum has an easy-to-read writing style and explains each technology he covers at the introductory to moderate level of depth.  The descriptions are ample for any manager and useful for technologists needing a concise reference to get the big picture of the technology they are beginning to work with.  There are lots and lots of clear diagrams.  You can learn a lot fast from this book, especially if you are new to EAI.  I have quite a bit of integration experience yet I found many sections quite helpful (typically in areas where I had not already done a project).<br /><br />Since Amazon has the table of contents on line I won't rehash everything the book covers.  Suffice it to say it addresses every significant EAI technology for distributed architectures from client, middleware or database tiers, except for web services.  There is also some coverage of centralized architectures (mainframe, midrange) and how they can interact with the distributed world. The book also addresses some famous (infamous?) applications such as SAP and integration approaches for them.  The author is careful to not to sell his software though his company sells EAI tools.  You get an expert without the pitch.<br /><br />I think it is most useful to note the book was published around 2000 when web-services were hardly on anyone's radar.  XML was on the scene and the book talks about it plenty.  Currently though you can't discuss EAI without discussing web services.  They are very useful, but my experience at the time of this review is all but the wealthiest customers are being slow to deeply adopt due to technical skills transfer in their staffs, etc.  Further, the web services community is splintering into complex standards versus grass roots movements (AJAX, RSS, etc.).  That means this book still covers a lot of technologies customers really use every day and will for a long time with or without web services.  I do not fault the author for not covering what didn't exist when he wrote the book, just consider these things before making your purchase decision.<br /><br />Another area of the book that is lacking is security coverage.  I literally only found one paragraph that really discussed security and it mostly said that it is an issue.  Again, the industry is not working in the author's favor.  Security in integration is nothing but a problem in virtually every technology you hear about (including web services).  So don't buy the book for its practical approach to security issues because they are well beyond its scope (hard to find anywhere).<br /><br />If you can live without web services and security info yet need to learn about practically every other aspect of multi-tier EAI, this is a good book.sider these things before making your purchase decision.

I am relatively new to the Emergent Church movement so I wanted something to help me understand its nature, especially as it relates to worship planning and music making.  My pastor, who was also reading this book at the time, recommended it to me.  I am glad he did.<br /><br />Kimball helped me understand that Emerging Worship is about a lifestyle of seeking to honor God.  While it is not hostile towards the traditional church model, it does seek to differentiate itself.  The differentiation is not just a marketing ploy as some might initially suspect.  Rather, Kimball explains the consistency of Emerging Worship as God centered, Christ honoring and biblically based.  My initial concerns about theological compromise have been put to rest.  I am now persuaded that a proper Emergent church is actually more concerned about majoring on the majors of biblical living than most churches.<br /><br />Practices and music handed down through centuries of church tradition are not casually discarded, but are prayerfully reviewed for relevance in today's culture.  Music can be rearranged without losing its initial meaning.  The order of a meeting can be adjusted, perhaps radically.  We don't need to have a superstar entertain us like clockwork each week to worship God. New songs can be written, it's okay; this is all biblical as long as it worships Him in Spirit and in Truth.  Most of our long held modernistic traditions are not as sacred as we think. Many do not appear in the Bible in any form. The world is leaving modernism behind; so must we.<br /><br />Our generation is called to be missionaries to postmodern people.  Much like missionaries in foreign lands, we too must have some understanding of the philosophies and passions of those around us, especially post baby-boomers who think significantly different than previous generations.  Understanding what's important to them is not an endorsement of all of it nor is it any compromise of the Gospel.  Just as with church traditions, every element of post-modernity should be subjected to the light of God's Word and discernment from His Spirit so we can be salt and light for all people.<br /><br />What all this means in practice is that Emerging Worship meetings may take various forms and include non-traditional elements such as improvised art, individual prayer and meditation stations, and especially moving the focus away from specific individuals (i.e. the church as a performance mindset). The church is not a drive-through meant to serve the customers who come by on Sunday. The church is the people comprising the servant body of Christ and the worship gathering is however they corporately meet to express their love toward God. Innovative ideas are encouraged as long as they do not violate any precept of Scripture. In fact, this approach is more in keeping with ancient church practices than most church services today. Read all of Acts 15, how does verse 28 apply today?<br /><br />The book is structured so the first half explains the need for Emerging Worship in lay terms while still doing a respectable job of handling some theological or at least ministerial questions.  This first half is not just theoretical.  I really like how Kimball's heart (humility and love) for others comes through again and again. In fact most of it deals with very practical questions like knowing how and what effect an Emerging Worship gathering might have in your community of believers (local church).  Steps to start the gathering, the importance of prayer, and critical questions are explored.<br /><br />The second half of the book is unique because it describes the structure of several thriving Emergent churches down to the order of a typical (and some not-so-typical) meeting for worship.  The types of groups covered vary widely from house churches, to Emergent gatherings integrated into larger traditional churches and stand alone Emergent gatherings.  This section is interesting to read for a while, but is probably better suited as a reference for an actual implementation.  The first half of the book is really the meat I was looking for, though I found some good ideas in the second section (having musicians seated to the side or back of a room so they don't compete for the focus on Jesus, for example).<br /><br />I like the book and recommend it if you have any interest (positive or negative) in the Emerging Church movement. Emerging Worship, as Kimball explains it, is Christ honoring and I am thrilled to be in an early stage of what will probably become the dominant church gathering model in the decades to come.<br /><br />May God bless you in whatever form of worship you have to truly honor Him who is worthy of all praise.ches and stand alone Emergent gatherings.

The book is built around five questions designed to stimulate self-reflection.  This helps us see ourselves as others see us and to see them as valuable even when we do not agree or understand them. I suspect almost anyone can find something, perhaps many things, in this book to help them grow in interpersonal skills.  Maxwell insists that we be authentic and even sacrificial in our relationships to get along with others.  He is absolutely right to instruct us that meeting someone half-way simply is not good enough.  If we value the other person (and why shouldn't we?) half-way is just a half hearted approach and the other person will eventually perceive our lack of care towards them.<br /><br />Maxwell helped me see most of our relational problems are in ourselves. I must take ownership of my shortcomings and strive to correct them.  Along with my own housecleaning I must learn to build healthy relationships with others accepting that they too have housecleaning needs they may or may not ever address.  Failure in either area on my part (housecleaning or skills building) can quickly destroy relationships I am currently blessed with. The first priority is learning how not to destroy relationships (get the beam out of my own eye), then learn to build good ones.<br /><br />Maxwell's straightforward style reaches out to everyone using interpersonal examples from sports, pastoring, business, gangsters, marriage, Abraham Lincoln and other great leaders.  Also, if you like to collect great quotes as I do, you will find dozens of good ones here (several from honest Abe).<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book but I have a few bones to pick that might bother some readers more or less so than they did me. At times I find Maxwell's approach superficial, too much cheerleading and not enough deep reflection. For example, some of the techniques for building up self esteem in others when you know practically nothing about them (p 92-95) strike me as insincere manipulation - calling it sincere doesn't make it so.  I also detect some deep underpinnings of consumerism (more is always better) in how Maxwell gauges success.  He often refers to who has the largest church attendance or how much the sales grew or other materialistic metrics to indicate success. For example a church with 15,000 members is referred to as being in the top 1% of churches in the country (p212) but no other success criteria are mentioned.  In the top 1% by whose standards?  Not mine, I don't think the Bible encourages that definition of success. I trust Maxwell is using this as just one convenient guidepost for success, but frankly his writing makes me wonder. I think it is a rather poor way to introduce the success of a church or pastor.  These kind of quantitative - grow-baby-grow type examples are common throughout the book.  Personally, I think hyper materialism/capitalism is fueling many of our relationship problems. I'm not comfortable having it sprinkled throughout a book on improving relationships.<br /><br />Finally, there are a few areas where trying to actually adopt what is recommended would drain you in every area of life. P224 recommends: \\"care more than other think is wise, risk more than others think is safe, dream more than others think is practical, expect more than others think is possible, work more than others think is necessary\\".  Maxwell's point is to live up to our highest ideals, but if I take this advice literally I am likely to damage relationships, not improve them because I'll be utterly exhausted in every area of my life - especially spiritually. If I am not to take it literally then it is just cheerleading to inspire me while I read the book.  Perhaps I missed the point, but I don't find this helpful past the initial moment of inspiration.<br /><br />As you can see I have mixed feelings about the book, but I do recommend it for those who want tobe led into some useful self-reflection/emotional inventory for improving relationships.e who want to be led into some useful self-reflection/emotional inventory for improving relationships. <br />	2005-09-30
US	49109688	R3LGF1X69XIGEF	0674012925	899091408	The Success of Open Source	Books	5	32	32	N	Y	A landmark work on the Open Source movement	I am a commercial software developer/manager who has often wondered about the broader motivations and implications of the Open Source movement, which is permeating many large patches of my industry.  I found this book incredibly helpful in giving me the background I needed to understand the various Open Source products and articles I encounter day to day.  Although my background is technical, this book generally is not.  Although some technical information is unavoidable, Weber does a great job of maintaining his position as a professional political scientist and an informed layman on software technology.  It may seem strange for a political scientist to approach this subject, but it turns out to be very beneficial because of the skill he has in analyzing organizations, their cultural, governmental, economic and societal impact.  This isn't really a political science book; it is deeply about Open Source. But, Weber did manage to get me a little more interested in political science too.<br /><br />Weber is a terrific writer. This is one of the best-organized, concisely written and cleanly reasoned books I have ever read.  That said, this is not light reading; you will need to put your thinking cap on and think big thoughts with the author pretty frequently. This is exactly what I was looking for. There's plenty of shallow analysis out there concerning Open Source. What Weber provides is the cross-discipline perspective of a professional scholar who has studied Open Source carefully.  I believe this book will prove useful to future historians when they want to understand the roots of Open Source, which, as Weber presents, could be very profound to our global economy and culture over decades to come.<br /><br />The first chapter cleanly outlines the goals and big questions of the book.  It also provides a primer on some of the main themes and terms such as the nature of property, what \\"free\\" means, current progress/status of Open Source etc.  This brief chapter helps those who are very new to Open Source and sketches the trajectory of the rest of the book; just what you expect from a professional scholar.<br /><br />Chapters Two through Four are about 30% of the book and chronicle the historic roots of Open Source (primarily the Unix community) through the past few decades of computing.  The history comes right up to the present to show how what started as fits and spurts for decades, has now become the wildly successful realization of an unlikely vision; a phenomena in modern technological accomplishments. These chapters help the reader grasp the true vision of Open Source.<br /><br />Chapter Five gathers hard data from surveys and empirical data from the online transcripts of Open Source projects to dissect the individual motivations of Open Source developers.  There is very little guesswork here. Some of the myths about why the developers do what they do are dismantled and replaced with more intelligent information about their intricate motivations.  Although I am not an Open Source developer, I have been a software professional for twenty years and worked with hundreds of other developers. Weber's sketch of the Open Source developer is very believable and resonates with many individual developers I have known.<br /><br />Chapter Six studies the way the Open Source community, especially developers, organize themselves in various communities such as Linux, Apache and others.  There are some good insights here for commercial teams to learn from.<br /><br />Chapter Seven unfolds many legal implications around property rights, business models and specific case studies such as Red Hat, Debian and many others.  This is great information and a unique contribution that is hard to find summarized as it is here.<br /><br />Chapter Eight explores the long term potential for profound impact Open Source may have globally, politically and economically. There is also interesting analysis concerning how hierarchical organizations interface with networked (web) organizations.  Finally, some suggestions for other fields of study that may copy the Open Source model are explored.<br /><br />I do not think you will find a more helpful analysis for the non-technical aspects of Open Source.  If I could give this book seven stars, I would.stions for other fields of study that may copy the Open Source model are explored.

The entire book is written in a Frequently Asked Questions format with most answers taking less than one page.<br /><br />This is an easy read (one or two sittings) but it is loaded with good advice that could only come from one who has the breadth of performing, playing and teaching experience of Ms. Isbin. All sorts of topics from how to choose a guitar, pack it for travel, get lessons for children, avoid squeaks on the bass strings, playing harmonics, set your concert program to suit the audience, etc. are all discussed in an informal, friendly way that is not too technical for any interested player to grasp.  The material is organized by general topic so it does not come at the reader like a grab bag of random subjects.<br /><br />One of the most useful features of the book is the extensive list of guitar makers, educational programs, music publishers, books and other resources in the back of the book. Those who have tried to build a good list like this know how valuable it can be to have them compiled by an expert, much thanks to her for that.<br /><br />I do have a couple of criticisms of the book. It is very limited in its discussion of repertoire. I realize lengthy details on topics such as interpretation and sight-reading etc. are beyond the intended scope of the book. But I would love to have the head of the Julliard guitar program give specific repertoire advice or recommended pieces for developing certain abilities at various skill levels.  She does recommend beginners start in Renaissance and Classical pieces, but isn't much more specific than this good but limited advice.  She spends much of the repertoire section discussing how she has worked with composers to expand the available repertoire. I am interested in that, but more interested in what key pieces of the existing repertoire she considers important for player development and why.  She also uses several pages toward the end of the book showing photocopies of her concert programs over the years - there's a little too much of this since the main points about programming were adequately described before these examples. 13% of the book seems excessive for showing program examples. There are a few times these kind of content choices seem self-promoting rather reader edifying - but it is not enough to damage the overall tone of the book which is healthy.<br /><br />This is a good book and worth the price if you would like a lot of practical everyday tips on being a player and performing from a world class master.  Who wouldn't want that ?  This is not the book to find advice on details concerning repertoire or anything related to the music itself...

Their combined experience as process troubleshooters, expert project managers and training consultants comes shining through in every part of the book. They are not trying to sell a product nor are they high on the latest industry buzz juice.  They have technical depth that is apparent from time to time, but this is not a technical book.  If you want to learn a lot about how to improve almost any kind of organizational process, this is a fantastic book. The approach would have worked well 20 years ago and it probably will 20 years from now.  Nevertheless, there is some discussion about IT and how important it is to the effort. In fact, the last part of Workflow Modeling shows how to translate all the process analysis work into Use Cases suitable for a detailed software development effort, but that is not the overall emphasis.<br /><br />The method the author's apply is given in four steps (p29):<br />1. Frame the process - Identify what is in and out of scope for being in the process to be improved.  Make sure you are working on an actual process and if not, locate one important to the original request so it can be improved.  Lots of tips on managing upper level management and non-quantifiable factors such as corporate culture, building grass roots support for the project etc.  This is roughly 30% of the book.<br />2. Understand the current as-is process - This is really the meat of this book.  Even if you aren't trying to change a process, but just understanding one, this section makes the book worth its price.  Using swim-lane diagrams at various levels of detail the book explains how to analyze the stuffing out of a process without getting bogged down in unnecessary detail.  Constructing professional swim-lane diagrams with all the actors, milestones, areas of uncertainty, process enablers and many other important topics are covered in practical, how-to terms. Roughly 40% of the book.<br />3. Design the new (to-be) process - using all you've gathered from previous stages, systematically apply and manage brainstorming and other creative tools to make sure the important parts of true improvement make it into the new process. Roughly 20% of the book.<br />4. Develop Use Case Scenarios  - For those who will then need to launch development work to support the new process (very common) this shows how to bridge that notorious gap between business needs and technical IT work.

Even though the book is nearly 300 pages, it gets directly to the main premise.  Show your prospect the best part, the most valuable aspect, of your product right at the front of your demo.  Cohan does this with the book as well by giving us the \\"punch line\\" on page 5, not page 205.  Just after the Introduction, the author gives us the \\"answer\\" to effective software demonstrations - \\"Do The Last Thing First.\\"  Show them that part of the killer demo that's meant to knock their socks off; that part traditionally following the grand build up like a symphony musical.  Just skip the prelude, build up and all that other stuff and show the customer what they really want to see. Then you have their attention to fill in the details because you've proven (hopefully) up front that you are relevant and worth their time.  It is interesting to observe how many proven advertising schemes already have this grab `em-up-front tactic built in.  This can be seen in some television and magazine ads, most trade show tables, and yes even SPAM.  Great Demo addresses this human need for immediate resolution - why is this worth my time at all? - in the board room during demos.<br /><br />With 250 more pages of regular content (not counting the Appendices, glossary, etc.) Great Demo has a lot more to say about knowing what the most relevant part of your system might be to show each individual client and how to deal with the inevitable questions, etc.  But, the core of Great Demo is simple, memorable and effective.  I have had the opportunity to give several demonstrations since reading Great Demo and I have found this up front approach really changes the dynamic with the prospect in a healthy way.  I think it helps differentiate our company/products since competitors may not be leading off with their best foot forward so intentionally.  There are also practical benefits since executive level prospects/audience members may be present only in the beginning of a demo but not the end.  If the opposite is true you can always show the best stuff again (and may be asked to do so), but if that exec leaves the presentation early and you haven't shown your best stuff, they may never see it at all. Of course, the book is well aware of this and many other practical benefits.  Cohan has a web site called DemoGurus so he has a good base of info in addition to his own extensive experience to build the Great Demo method upon.<br /><br />Interestingly, the book develops as if it is following its own method by unfolding more and more answers about the method itself as the chapters progress (as if it were the product being demo'd). In the early going this can be a little slow to develop, but by the middle of the book, there is a wealth of knowledge being presented.  The presentation of the entire book also has business appeal.  The pages are short and most follow a checklist type format.  This makes the content easy to locate and train/test others on.<br /><br />In addition to the Do the Last Thing First tactic, Great Demo also emphasizes showing only those Specific Capabilities that are necessary to address the customer's problem.  This second point is also extremely important, but unlike the Do the Last Thing First advice, it can be found in most contemporary software demo methods.  Great Demo, like its rivals, is smart enough to know software products these days are just too deep or broad to show in their entirety, this would only frustrate the prospect.  Great Demo is very good about combining up to date management insights with its own unique contributions.  In fact, Great demo is partially based upon the best thinking from the field of personal performance such as Covey's 7 Habits, and Solution Selling from Bosworth.  Bosworth's Solution Selling is recommended multiple times as an important supplement to Great Demo. These thought leaders inform Cohan's organization of the Great Demo method.  A reading list at the end of the book has helpful comments on these books and others the author has found valuable.<br /><br />As the chapters progress, practical topics such as preparing the sales setup, tech aspects of the demo and dealing with questions are discussed point by point.  The preparation chapters (especially technical) receive a lot of pages and account for about a quarter of the book. Chapter 11 is about doing remote demos and is worth the price of the book because it clarifies some practical approaches to this increasingly common medium for demos.  As many of us can attest by now, remote demos can be really tedious/ineffective. In a nutshell, you must make the remote demo interactive even though it seems like a poor medium for doing so.  Chapter 11 tells you how to manage the remote demo so you can turn it into an advantage for everyone.<br /><br />I've read/reviewed other books on giving software demos and I think the Great Demo method is the most up-to-date and down-on-the-street effective.

Later in the book, the extrapolation to constraints in management policies is an interesting and logical conclusion to the book.<br /><br />5. Pretty good characters - some of them are more brilliant than the above average folk you meet in the business world  - the main character Alex is very sharp.<br /><br />6. The principles given sound obvious but many times this what the best theorists do - systematize common sense.<br /><br />7. I like the idea of the scientific method discovering intrinsic order in things that appear too complex to predict.  Pretty good informal definition of science - which is notoriously difficult to define formally (read Thomas Kuhn).<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />1. Too long...a lot of novel to wade through for nuggets of TOC theory. TOC web sites better source for concise treatment. Got so involved and lengthy it was hard for me to absorb the lessons later in the book.<br /><br />2. Main character's wife is like a whiney little girl, not a woman, through much of the book - mostly because her husband wouldn't communicate and be honest with her....still a whiney spoiled child.  I got very tired of her so it didn't matter when she got better.  She detracts from the value of the book.<br /><br />3. A few inconsistencies in the story - not a big deal - but since it is a novel this is fair game. Example, early in the book Alex says he studied advanced math formulas in college, later he doesn't know enough math to approach a physics book.... It's at least confusing if I am mistaken on this point.<br /><br />4. Tape editing could be better. Very long pauses between chapters make it hard to know if you're at the end of a tape.  Otherwise, the audio quality and reading are very good.<br /><br />The final tape is an essay by the book's author on his own experience as a management theorist/businessman.<br /><br />1. Brilliant mind, obviously the genius behind the novel and TOC...time will tell if it as important as calculus as he claims - that's a tall order.<br /><br />2. Gives considerable detail about his roller coaster story of software companies, books, movies, games - all sorts of channels to get his theories out there.  Many times the theories have been proven in the real world - more of this case study info would have been helpful.<br /><br />3. Please forgive me if I am being too unkind, but I think this needs to be said: Mr. Goldratt seems to have some sort of martyr complex in never missing an opportunity to point out individuals, often by name, who disagreed with him and were later proven wrong.  I didn't buy the book to hear these sort of self-aggrandizing charges made against other people I don't know.  I bet there is another side to his story and frankly I don't care to hear that one either.  Just give me the info (TOC) I bought the book for.  This can be accomplished without the constant refrain of how non-understanding specific individuals can be (like the books' co-author among many others) in resisting change while simultaneously showing how brilliant Mr. Goldratt is.<br /><br />I give the book a good rating because of how innovative it is and how important the ideas in it seem to be.  If you just want the TOC info, look on the web for it.  If you want some entertainment while being introduced to the theories it's a pretty good book.e, later he doesn't know enough math to approach a physics book....

The presentation is colorful, rich and engaging.  This is the only exercise book I have seen that approaches the weightlifting body from the inside-out.  In addition to the terrific musculature and skeletal diagrams on each page, the exercises are explained briefly but in sufficient detail with pointers for what to do and not do.  The most popular exercises are presented here, organized by major and minor muscle groups.<br /><br />This is not another encyclopedia full of exercises (though I find those helpful too).  This book helps make you more aware of your muscles so you have another way of visualizing correct form in an exercise.  The diagrams depict both men and women in a realistic way so both genders can benefit from the book. However, Delavier has another edition of this book showing other exercises popular with women.<br /><br />I work out at home so without the benefit of trainers or other experienced lifters around me, I have found this kind of info invaluable.  Make yourself a smarter lifter and get this book for education and reference into the future.	2005-02-19

Essentially every word you might want to look up from the Bible is laid out in dictionary style - from Abronah to Nicolaitans to Zaphon, each with at least a few sentences, and usually more, to explain what is known about them.  There are also more extensive sections on occupations of Biblical times, charts of political parties, parables, weights and measures, maps, time lines and much more.<br /><br />This Holman dictionary has over 600 illustrations and plenty of photos of landscapes from the Holy Land, etc.  There are other good Bible dictionaries available, but this one is the best illustrated and attractively arranged that I know of.  The other dictionaries I've seen may have more text per entry, but I find Holman to be completely adequate in this regard. The text is also typeset cleanly so it is easy to read; this is not always the case with other dictionaries. Holman's dictionary is a terrific tool for helping your study come to life in a vivid way.<br /><br />I would recommend a Bible dictionary even if you have a good study Bible.  There is a lot more information in the dictionary than any Bible can really present. Holman's dictionary is keyed to match several popular Bible translations so whichever English translation you prefer, you'll likely find the entries in Holman's to match.  Halley's Bible Handbook is also a useful tool for getting a high level overview of information as you study. A Bible handbook does not overlap with the dictionary, they each serve a distinct purpose, but the dictionary is the more valuable of the two if you must choose between them.<br /><br />May God bless your time in His Word	2005-02-12

Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Practical advice for the most common ministry field	This book has helped me in living out my faith in the workplace. Ross West has the hard won experience and spiritual depth needed to really be a guide to many of us in this challenging area. He addresses many areas such as responding to unethical situations and seeing spiritual value in our work/in others. He establishes a useful theology of why we work and what our work means and then proceeds to show many practical examples of how that theology can be applied in everyday work-a-day life. One of my favorite parts of the book is the simple but profound observation that we can and should view our work, no matter what it is, as ultimately helping another person somewhere. It's hard to think of a job where this is not the case and even though my technology job is somewhat removed from people directly, it does help them elsewhere. The book caused me to reflect on my work in constructive ways after years of confusion on this topic. I have already recommended the book to some close Christian friends who have the same challenges. It is not easy to find books that are as theologically sound and practical as this one. I am starting to read William E. Diehl who has also written in this area.	2005-01-19

Post-trib says we will be raptured (or resurrected if already asleep) but only after a time of tribulation in which there will be trials, but also divine protection for believers of that generation. The rapture/resurrection of saints will be when Christ's supernatural return (to establish the thousand-year reign and judge) is well-known to the whole world. There will not be a seven-year gap between the rapture and Christ's 1000 year reign.<br /><br />Ladd mentions a few times that his background was formerly Dispensational, which teaches the pre-tribulation rapture of the church (like the Left Behind series of books).  While this is a popular view of Biblical eschatology, I think approaching the Bible more simply (as Ladd does) shows that being popular is the main thing pre-trib has going for it.<br /><br />Like many Christians today, I assumed a pre-trib eschatology - before I studied the Word for myself more consistently. I have found Ladd's explanations are well thought out and do great justice to a natural reading of the texts. Even before reading anything from Ladd I was convinced that Dispensationalism imposes, rather than discovers, its theology on the texts. Dispensationalism is an argument from silence built upon rigid rules of interpretation. Ladd repeatedly demonstrates that Dispensational theology makes unnatural distinctions in phrases like \\"the Kingdom of God\\" and the \\"Kingdom of heaven\\" when they are actually equivalent.  This tendency to over-literalize slight differences in wording as differences in meaning has led many Christian brothers and sisters to an extremely complex eschatology that does not square with many areas of Scripture (both OT and NT).<br /><br />Ladd's book is not primarily a critique of Dispensationalism. It is a good explanation of what is sometimes called historic premillenialism.  This is the view held by many church leaders throughout the centuries well before Dispensationalism  and it is still widely held today (this doesn't make it correct, but at least worthy of consideration).  Ladd shows how eschatology was essential in the teaching Jesus most emphasized - \\"the Kingdom\\".  Ladd uses examples from The Sermon on the Mount, Kingdom parables, and many others to show how the end times and the Kingdom Jesus said was already upon us are directly related.  Paul's letters are also carefully examined for eschatological information.  We should realize that we don't need to wait in a state of anticipation hoping for Jesus to bring the Kingdom - He already has!  The Kingdom has already invaded this world but the work of final consummation is not yet finished, and it is God's work we are privileged to participate in.  We will not be raptured out of hard times, but like so many saints before us we will live out our faith as citizens of a different order only bowing the knee to the One who is already reigning as King!<br /><br />Most of Ladd's books are more technical than this one and his \\"A Theology of the New Testament\\" is standard reading in many seminaries.  Ladd has gone to be with the Lord, but his gifts and diligence made him one of the finest evangelical scholars of the 20th century. If you are a Bible teacher or aspiring Bible student looking for a well-informed introduction to post-trib rapture and Kingdom based eschatology, you will not find a better guide than Ladd.  If you are pretty familiar with the Bible, you will find this book a quick, enjoyable read and it may help you see eschatology, and your role in it, in a whole new (and very Biblical) way.<br /><br />Grace and peace in Christ.hurch leaders throughout the centuries well before Dispensationalism  and it is still widely held today (this doesn't make it correct, but at least worthy of consideration).

I have a background in apologetics, but limited exposure to philosophy.  This book by Wood delivers the philosophical subject of epistemology in a way I think serious lay students can grasp and enjoy, especially those interested in Christian philosophy.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Wood makes it clear he is trying to re-establish some historic ground with an epistemology emphasizing intellectual virtue (as opposed to intellectual vice).  Patterns of intellectual virtue like being truthful, teachable, inquisitive and observant are contrasted with intellectual vices like willful ignorance, obtuseness and vicious curiosity (e.g. an insatiable quest for information irrespective of personal or environmental harm).  Personal motives and similar deeper spiritual/psychological factors are explored as being drivers of whether a particular intellectual attribute is a virtue or a vice.  Wood does not claim individual credit for this insight and traces its origins to ancient authors like Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas (p17).  \\"A motif of this book [is] that study of some of the traditional concerns of epistemology illuminate powerfully on our understanding of certain intellectual virtues, and vice versa. The old and the new thus compliment one another\\" (p76).<br /><br />Much of the book involves a comparison of foundationalism and coherentism as two main schools of epistemology.  Internalism, externalism and justification also get plenty of discussion and I needed all of this. Since I'm not well schooled in epistemology at this time, I won't try to critique the subtle ins and outs of his thought, but I found all of it useful.  Page 144 seems to hold a key quote to help get a fix on Wood, for those who are already savvy in epistemology: \\"My claim is that an account of justification derived from the broader tradition of virtue epistemology captures the keys insights of both internalists and externalists.\\"  Wood also discusses the potential of his theory being susceptible to failure in case of self-deception (p150-1) and defends against this objection.<br /><br />Although Wood frequently compares his Intellectual Virtues epistemology with other contemporary theories, there is useful general background on the field of epistemology.  \\"Because this book highlights matters of intellectual virtue and vice, many topics routinely treated in introductory texts to epistemology do not receive sustained or systematic treatment\\" (p8). Wood gives references in the back of the book to more general epistemology textbooks and I found this list useful for my next study.<br /><br />Although this is not a straight philosophy textbook per se', make no mistake that is loaded with introductory philosophy - you may find it handy to have a book (or the Internet) to look up info on people like Descartes (who gets extended discussion), Hume, Aristotle, Reid, Kant, Plantinga, etc.  I also put my dictionary to work to learn words like: apodictic, desiderata, simplicter, infelicitous.  Don't get the idea the book is dry or overly hard to penetrate, it's not; but the author doesn't hide the fact he is a philosopher.  The only improvement I can think of for this book would be to add end of chapter review questions to help philosophy beginners like me.<br /><br />Last point, there is some humor; here's one of my favorites: \\"If someone whacks me upside the head with a polo mallet, simultaneously scrambling my brains and producing in me a true belief about the temperature in Bangkok, no on is tempted to call my newfound belief knowledge.\\" (p171).  As far as philosophy goes, I find that pretty funny. I love this book and recommend it highly.d externalists.\\"  Wood also discusses the potential of his theory being susceptible to failure in case of self-deception (p150-1) and defends against this objection.

The Hendricks' show us how proper interpretation of scripture is used to fuel our minds for improved prayer/meditation based on God's principles.  These principles are to be applied in our daily lives to change us and consequently change our corner of the world.  The overall approach is the same used by most Bible study methods; that is, \\"inductive\\" Bible study - observe, interpret, apply.<br /><br />The authors stress honest observation of the Biblical text without the influence of a pretense or agenda to affect the interpretation.  An extremely detailed and systematic observation of the text being studied is stressed as the most crucial aspect of interpretation. Proper interpretation is unlikely without the foundation of an extremely thorough observation of the text itself.  About half the book is used to fully explore the questions and forms of textual observation.<br /><br />The book is loaded with practical ways to assist in interpretation during your Bible study. For example, transporting your senses into the story to help relate to David in a cave or Paul in prison.  Clever tools like the fingers of your hand can be used to remember 5 things to look for when interpreting a passage. Another easy-to-remember idea is to ask the 6 w's - who, what, where, when, why and wherefore (wherefore is the \\"so what?\\" part of life application).<br /><br />The authors encourage the application of Biblical principles in our lives. The final section of the book presents a set of questions and motivations for applying the Bible in everyday life. There are many lists to derive life application points: is there a command to obey, an example to follow, a doctrine to be believed, etc.?  A recurring theme is the Biblical understanding of Godly knowledge that is summarized as `knowing without doing isn't knowing at all.'<br /><br />I like this book overall but there are a few things I don't care for.  I think it is too long and redundant on some points.  150 pages on every conceivable aspect/permutation of observing a text is excessive.  Chapter 7, for example, talks about general reading skills. This is good information to mention but I don't think it deserved a chapter.  You can get value from the book by selectively reading most of the chapters and omitting some like 7,13,14,20 (about 7% of the book). This is definitely not the author's intent, but it is how I recommend the book to people who don't have much reading time.<br /><br />Another way to improve this book would be more coverage about literary genre (parable, poetry, history, letter, etc.).  Chapter 29 covers this somewhat, but with a book this size, I would expect more on this important area for interpreting a text. How To Read the Bible for All its Worth, (Fee) and Effective Bible Teaching (Wilhoit) cover genre very well and are better choices if you don't need something as basic as \\"Living by the Book\\".<br /><br />Living by the Book is a good choice for adult beginners, including high school students, to get started into productive Bible study.<br /> <br />I like this book overall but there are a few things I don't care for.

US	49109688	R2TF1P9EN7O6HN	1578561493	835168288	Intimate Issues: Conversations Woman to Woman - 21 Questions Christian Women Ask About Sex	Books	4	194	199	N	Y	My wife and I like this book	Okay, I'm not woman; but my wife is, and we both read and liked this book.  Here's our combined review:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Easy to read - Conversational style of writing and clear points.  We each read it in one sitting.<br /><br />2. Adults only - Sometimes a grown-up discussion is required. This is a book for married women (and men). It is explicit and direct (without being crude) about physical sexual information.  It is definitely not appropriate for girls (or boys).<br /><br />3. Scriptural approach - Instead of just giving motherly advice, the authors take the Bible seriously and frequently use it as a home base to direct their thoughts.  Mind you, this is not a Bible study per se'. There is plenty of 21st century, frank counseling advice, but it is blended and based upon Biblical principles.  Provides a scriptural index to locate where specific passages are mentioned - useful to Bible teachers.<br /><br />4. Practical - Lots of ideas for rekindling relationship, romance, plain sex and other aspects of adult relationship.  These are ideas you can start this week.<br /><br />5. Both authors relate from personal experience - Both have personally wrestled with sexual questions and counseled many women.  These personal accounts add a human dimension to the principles discussed. This isn't just another \\"name it and claim it\\" woman's book.  Many personal stories are provided including tough ones where women are still struggling/praying through difficulties. This book explains their stories.<br /><br />6. Focuses on Song of Solomon - The erotic portions of the Song indicate an expressive, sensuous, even adventurous attitude in romantic sexuality.  These authors aren't the first to recognize its racy sections - which has led the church to skate around it in too many cases. It is part of God's word and has a purpose; this book helps illuminate the subject.<br /><br />7. Good tool for adult couple communication - The frankness and openness from a woman's perspective is valuable to both men and women.  This is not just another \\"men are pigs and need to change\\" woman's book. Men can learn quite a bit here without being put-off.<br /><br />8. Emphasizes prayer - Example prayers to help with feelings of sexual inadequacy and temptation.<br /><br />9. Role of Christian liberty - Scripture sets the boundaries of proper sexuality, don't just rely on Victorian era prudence.  There is no compromise if the Scripture forbids certain practices, but there is responsible liberty where Scripture is silent. Provides 3 Biblical questions to ask if you aren't sure whether specific modern sexual practices belong in your marriage, (p203).<br /><br />10. Men - Accurately describes male sexual needs and psyche - basic, but accurate.<br /><br />11. Exercise - the physiological benefits for healthy sexuality are briefly explained. Encourages women to take care of, and appreciate, their bodies as they are right now.  Don't try to be a supermodel.<br /><br />Cons/concerns:<br /><br />1. More insight into males - Needs more insight into male sexuality; men are half the equation. It is a women's book and does mention men have emotion and identity wrapped up in sex, but it does not provide enough examples of how this can affect common male-female relationship problems.  The Scriptures showing how David, Joseph (of Genesis) and others handled, and mishandled, sex would be consistent with the books' approach, but are not discussed. Of course there are page limits for writers.<br /><br />2. Lays a lot at the woman's feet - It's definitely not just another \\"men are pigs\\" book - there are already plenty of those.  In fact, a feminist would likely critique this book for telling women to see sex with their husband as a pleasant responsibility in marriage.  If it's not pleasant this is probably rooted in a spiritual issue. The book does not try to make women sex slaves in marriage, far from it. But, there are times when sex is treated as a ministry to your husband because he has so much emotion and expressive love tied up in sex, more so than women do.  This may not sit well with some women; it will probably sit just fine with most men ;-&#62;.<br /><br />3. Forcing modern openness about sex into the Bible? - Some conservatives might criticize the book for reading 20th century women's sexual liberation back into the Scriptures. There are some very explicit interpretations, especially in the Song of Solomon.  Of course, the physical acts weren't invented recently; they may just get more attention now than in ancient times, or, maybe not.  At the very least, the motive of the authors seems proper to me. Their interpretation is a corrective to the hyper prudence and stifling of healthy marital sexuality, within the Church, for many centuries.  There are some risk-taking interpretations - and I think they have merit to at least be seriously considered.  You'll have to read the book and decide for yourself.reated as a ministry to your husband because he has so much emotion and expressive love tied up in sex, more so than women do.

It covers the bases of what an Introduction is expected to do. The authorship, historical context/date, content outline, main theological features and other interesting background are given for each book of the New Testament. This is similar to the background information found in good study Bibles, but an Introduction goes much further.<br /><br />The preface states the book is suitable for freshman college classes in the New Testament and I think it fills that bill very well.  Encountering the New Testament is unapologetically evangelical and is constructed around three theological themes: God, people, and the gospel as it relates to individuals.<br /><br />The content is extremely well organized and features color inserts and photographs on almost every page to keep the feel upbeat and lively.  The typeset is big and clear. There are numerous archaeological and cultural inserts to add contemporary relevance to whatever topic is in view.  Each chapter has good Review Questions, Deeper Study Questions and a Further Reading guide to many excellent resources - these are all very useful.  There is also a pretty good glossary, very good subject index and thorough Scripture index, as you'd expect of a theological work.<br /><br />The book comes with a companion CD that covers the topics of the book in very limited depth.  Even though it has cool menus, neat graphics and some multimedia clips, I did not find the companion CD content useful (but I rarely do with any book). The CD chapter Review questions are the same ones in the book - disappointing. Maybe I ought to knock a point off the rating since the price is probably higher due to the CD. Since I didn't get the book for the CD at all, I'm not holding this against what is otherwise a good book.  If you want a deep companion CD, buy something else (I'm not sure what).<br /><br />With good beginning level content, excellent organization, color pictures, relevant sidebars and a not too useful CD, this might seem to be the NT Introduction for everyone; it is not.  If you need a top notch scholarly NT Introduction, get Donald Guthrie's \\"New Testament Introduction\\". It is much bigger, has practically no pictures, is not easy for people who haven't gone to seminary, has no CD and is one of the best quality, well researched, well written NT Introductions ever.  To contrast, Encountering the New Testament is a classroom textbook that covers similar ground in less depth but a more accessible style.<br /><br />After having read Encountering the New Testament for two NT survey classes, I now use it frequently as a reference and always enjoy its friendly presentation of useful content.> <br />With good beginning level content, excellent organization, color pictures, relevant sidebars and a not too useful CD, this might seem to be the NT Introduction for everyone; it is not.

I use this book all the time and find the articles concise, informative and insightful. If you are really into Christian apologetics, you have found a book you definitely need.<br /><br />Many of the articles refer to one another so it is possible to start in one area of interest and be led to other topics that provide further depth.  This is especially true in the areas of epistemology, arguments and evidence for God's existence, and the thoughts of most famous philosophers throughout history.  As you read through the chains of articles, Dr. Geisler's method as a classical apologist comes through effectively.  He frequently refers to the use of evidence combined with reason as being sufficient to prove that God exists (there are other aspects to classical apologetics, but this is a big one).  For example, in his article about Gordon Clark (famous presuppositional apologist whose methods were very different from the classical method), Geisler writes: \\"Logic...tells what could be true; not what is true. To know what is really true, sooner or later one must touch base with the external world. This is what classical apologetics does.\\" p153<br /><br />The strength of this book is Dr. Geisler's extensive knowledge of philosophy/worldviews and how they interact with world religions, especially Christianity, through the ages.  There is a good article on Islam and a slighter one on Hinduism. His writing style is very clear provided you have some background to approach the material being discussed.  This is not a shortcoming of his book, it's just the nature of the content in all intermediate/advanced apologetic books.<br /><br />There are a few things this book is not, that might reasonably be expected.  It does not do much to address pseudo-Christian cults (there are lots of them).  For example, there are no articles under \\"Mormonism\\", \\"Joseph Smith\\", \\"Latter Day Saints\\", \\"Jehovah's Witnesses\\", \\"WatchTower Society\\", etc.  Unfortunately, the publisher's back cover on the book (which serves as the only preface) indicates that it could be used in counter-cult apologetics.  I do not believe it is well suited to that specialized task, though it is generally useful for many apologetics ministries. Dr. Geisler has a book called \\"When Cultics Ask\\", but I am not familiar with it.  \\"Fast Facts on False Teachings\\" by Ron Carlson is useful for basic counter cult information.  Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics also does not directly address many ethical apologetics topics.  There are no articles specifically for: abortion, euthanasia, gambling, etc.<br /><br />This book may not be useful to you if you are not interested in deeply pursuing a variety of apologetics topics. If you are looking for more down-to-earth, conversational style responses in everyday, apologetic/evangelistic encounters try these authors: Paul Copan, Ken Boa, Paul Little, Cliffe Knechtle.<br /><br />This is a must have resource for those who are studying apologetics broadly and deeply, especially as it intersects with philosophy, world religions and some scientific issues.  There are good articles on Hume, Aquinas, Muhammad, Pascal, Darwin and many others. Dr. Geisler has done us a great service by distilling his gifted lifetime of work/knowledge in this way., \\"Latter Day Saints\\", \\"Jehovah's Witnesses\\", \\"WatchTower Society\\", etc.  Unfortunately, the publisher's back cover on the book (which serves as the only preface) indicates that it could be used in counter-cult apologetics.

You won't find a lot about the overall sales process found in so many other books, just giving good demos and closely related information.<br /><br />The author is analytic, but is able to explain ideas in plain language.  The compelling value behind this book is Riefstahl 's real world experience giving lots of demos, in different settings, with a few different products he's sold.  He urges us to not think of great software demos as a mysterious art, but rather as the result of good preparation and smart tactics.<br /><br />A recurring theme, and indeed the unwritten theme of the book, is to build a \\"bridge\\" for your prospect to cross over from their world of comfort (usually no change) to the one you are presenting.  Things seeming trivial or obvious to us as demonstrators can be confusing or offensive to a prospect.  The author fills the book with practical ways to put yourself in the clients' place, then design and execute a demo to show why the customer should trust you across the bridge they are so uncertain about. It's all about the prospects' needs, not just features the sales person likes to show.<br /><br />The chapter called \\"Demo Crime Files\\" is about 20% of the book. This detailed list of 28 \\"what not to do's\\" such as bad PowerPoint slides, arguing with the prospect, how to make a boring/irrelevant demo, etc. helps make the book well worth the price.<br /><br />Another 20% of the book is on \\"Discovery\\". Throughout the book, Riefstahl stresses the need to perform a deep and thorough discovery of your prospects' business, personnel, etc. before designing and presenting the demo for the buyers.  He has successfully used this approach, but this is a topic where I have to get off his bandwagon somewhat.  I don't disagree that at least some discovery is necessary, but my limited experience has been that the Discovery methodology of this book may not be feasible. I just don't think many customers today will give as much access to key personnel (and especially not executives) as the author assumes.  Prospects will invest some personnel time (with a vendor they don't know very well) on the phone and some in person, but not a lot in either case. Riefstahl offers some good guidelines on how to get the most out of discovery and how to pitch it so it won't seem like an imposition.  It's very important to him, so I should probably be more open-minded, but I am skeptical.  What he advocates as a sunk cost Discovery could otherwise be billable as pre-sales professional consulting - it's that detailed.  I think Riefstahl is tech savvy and experienced enough to pull this off for his deals, but I'm not sure it's a feasible approach for most of us.<br /><br />One other assumption made is that the demo is very important to the prospect so they will give it a lot of their time. One and two day demonstrations just don't seem to happen anymore as far as I can tell, but the book is written as if they are common. In fairness to the author, I think the business climate has changed for software evaluation since this book was written. Today, the demo (especially an initial one) is just one more meeting in a process the prospects' key personnel have to work through (with multiple vendors) while trying to get their regular job done at the same time.  My goal is for a product demo to be compelling enough to get a lot more of their time after they've first seen it; I can't assume this before they have.<br /><br />I like the book and being relatively new to the sales field (as a tech sales engineer doing demos), I got quite a bit from it.  There are several take-aways I can definitely improve upon.  The book is an easy read and has a good index.  I'm tempted to give it a higher rating, but I can't because of the assumptions about the initial demo being so long and important to the prospect (it's often not the case) and the access/skill required to do the full Discovery Riefstahl insists is vital.  These assumptions are woven throughout the book and its method.  Nevertheless, I have benefited from the book.) and the access/skill required to do the full Discovery Riefstahl insists is vital.

I bought this book to become more educated on the Miller Heiman sales approach that is now standard for all of our sales people. I found this book very helpful and feel as though I now have a  basic working knowledge of the sales system we use.The Miller Heiman training is rather expensive so I did not attend the actual classes with our regular sales staff.<br /><br />The approach of this book came naturally to me.  This sales strategy is much like engineering decisions in using continual review of risks and generating ideas to mitigate those risks while simultaneously advancing toward the closing of the project (a sales deal). There are many lists and sublists within the method that are pretty well known by now so I won't try to list many of them here. The terminology is important and very memorable - \\"Coach\\", \\"Economic Buyer\\", \\"Funnel\\", \\"Best Few\\", etc.<br /><br />The book is clear about what it is not and I appreciate that too since sales is not my background.  It is not a book of sales tactics, that is, how to literally sell someone something face to face in the \\"sales event\\" as the book calls it. The book assumes the reader is an experienced sales person and is already perfecting this skill (a fair assumption).  It also does not try to teach skills in deal closure/contracting since that subject is already covered by many other books and is another assumed skill.<br /><br />What the book does talk about at length is approaching each deal as a unique project that has its own risks, dynamics and yet can be managed within a systematic framework for success. \\"This entire book can be seen as an analytical machine designed to produce one meticulously tested product - your Alternate Positions list.\\" (p171)  The Alternate Positions list is essentially a list of ideas of what things you might try next along with the accompanying rationale for each idea. The ideas are very specific so they can be tested for pass/fail, they are not vague notions. Updated  \\"Alternate Positions\\" are continuously needed because your current position is assumed to be in need of constant improvement until you win the sale, from beginning to end.  When applied to an actual case, the strategy means to shake-out undue sales optimism with realism on specific important aspects of getting THIS deal, not just any deal generally, this one deal specifically.<br /><br />There are plenty of real life sales examples throughout the book that put flesh on the theoretical framework. I relate to the systematic, risk mitigating approach, but I was reminded of my own shortcomings in reading and managing the dynamics of people who can be fluid, dynamic, fickle, irrational, etc. yet very important to winning the account. This is the sales persons' chosen medium (people skills) and it is more tricky and unfair than dealing with things. However, the engineering, project oriented, framework makes sense in both of these worlds and the book does a great job of prompting sales people to think a bit more like engineers.  Relentless information gathering (and analysis for adding to actual knowledge) is the bottom line to succesfully navigating through a complex project of any type.<br /><br />I particularly like the way the book views competition as those who run the race against you trying to get to the sale first, instead of being the ones standing in front of you who must be defeated to surely win the customers business (definitely not a sure approach).  Miller Heiman stresses focusing on the prospect from first to last, not the competitor.  Competitors and the risks they entail must be managed, but not become the focus.  The message is, carry out the Miller Heiman system (run the race) better than they do and you will typically win the business over them.<br /><br />This is an easy read and really a nice page-turner especially if you're new to sales readinglike I am.  It's good it's a page turner though because the book is a bit too long and redundant for the ground it covers. It is all useful info but I think at least 15% of the book could be eliminated since it is driving home the same fundamentals over and over again from slightly different perspectives like you were sitting in the classroom. I understand the merits, but my reading time is valuable to me so I subtracted a rating point for failure to streamline the book a bit more.  I expect successful complex sales professionals will recognize many of the ideas here, but the information is very well organized and probably a good purchase for anyone connected with sales, especially uninitiated tech types like me.o sales reading like I am.

These interacting viewpoint books are a great idea but they are difficult to pull-off because at least one viewpoint usually suffers.  In this book, Creationism in particular is not well represented. Since this view is a historical cornerstone in the discussion, the overall book suffers as a result.<br /><br />Frair and Patterson represent the Creationist viewpoint (young and old-earth views are essentially combined in this book).  Their opening position statement, as expected, emphasizes the priority of an inerrant Scripture as the authority in human knowledge though they also encourage vigorous scientific inquiry and believe the two ultimately converge into one reality.  But, their interactions with other viewpoints throughout the book tend to miss the point by avoiding any contrast/conflict.  This avoidance hurts the value of the book and depth of their presentation.<br /><br />Pond represents what is called the Independence view, which is often ignored in these discussions. Independence asserts that theology and science are two completely different areas of knowledge with no appreciable overlap in describing reality.  If there is a question about the actual physical history of earth, it is resolved solely by science.  Likewise, if there is a question of human spirituality it is resolved solely in the area of religion (Christianity for Pond).  Pond says she considers scripture one more facet of information, which is to be considered along with church tradition (Episcopal in her case), and human reason depending upon the subject at hand. In the case of physical earth history, she sees no role for the Bible. She does not accept the notion that the scripture is inerrant and asks for a definition of the term (FYI Feinberg provides a great one in \\"Inerrancy\\" edited by Geisler).  In place of inerrancy Ponds promotes the NOMA principle popularized by Stephen Jay Gould. Pond is eloquent for her position and interacts with other viewpoints in a consistent manner that provides some color to what is generally a bland book.  Aside from the color she adds to the discussion, I find her view of scripture and science (along with NOMA) to be an elaborate cop-out that gives total precedence to science at every point in the discussion carrying any significance for discovering physical reality.  Pond (and NOMA) seem to overlook the turbulent nature of scientific theories throughout history while discounting the possibility that the Bible has a divine author capable of giving a general but accurate description of physical reality that science is yet to fully discover.<br /><br />The Qualified Agreement viewpoint is covered by Meyer and basically says that we should accept a highly interactive view of both scripture and science on a case-by-case basis where there are no hard and fast rules as to which will take precedence beforehand.  After tracing the history of earlier intelligent design efforts by Paley and others, Meyer provides an onslaught of physical evidence from various fields of science.  This chapter has so many well-known examples of design that the overall method (inference to the best explanation) does not receive the attention it deserves.  Meyer is consistent throughout the book making most of his arguments from contemporary scientific evidence suggesting design, rather than from scripture.  Meyer footnotes his evidence well and provides a veritable who's who of intelligent design authors such as Dembski, Behe, Ross and Denton.<br /><br />Van Till provides the Partnership view, which says that science and Christian theology can go hand in hand without conflict.  This view emphasizes a possible harmony between the two fields of knowledge and seeks to explain it with what Van Till calls the Robust Formation Economy (RFE). He prefers RFE to theistic evolution, which is more often used as a category for his viewpoint.  The RFE basically says God created the universe as an amazing evolutionary machine that is capable of unfolding in the way modern evolutionary sciences say it does with no further intervention from God.  Van Till feels this view ascribes more glory to God than the interventionist views held by Creationists or Qualified Agreement camps (Independence would seem to agree more with Van Till though it has no identifiable position as to interaction).  Van Till's position is open to the critique (attempted but not adequately made in this book) that he is just playing games with words.  Renaming deism to RFE doesn't really help things very much. His position counters scripture in a number of areas that indicate God is actively involved in the daily workings of nature, not just the macro architect from billions of years ago.  Partnership ends up being a cop-out theory like Independence, it's just dressed up with fancier words and ideas, but not strong arguments based upon theological and scientific data.<br /><br />This is a mediocre book that had the potential to be excellent but did not achieve that goal.  There actually aren't that many intermediate books available in the area of philosophy of science and Christianity, but this is one. If you just want one book in this area choose Three Views on Creation and Evolution by Moreland and Reynolds; it is somewhat better than this book.used as a category for his viewpoint.

Erickson writes with a very accessible style.  If you have limited background with postmodern thought and would like a useful introduction from a Christian perspective, this is a good choice.  I have appreciated Erickson's theological writings for some time and also like this book as a casual read that still provides sufficient analysis.<br />&quot;The Postmodern World&quot; may help you reflect upon your own influences. In reading it I found myself more influenced and accommodating of postmodern ideas than I had suspected. This is not all bad, but it does have to be kept in check and that is part of Erickson's point.  Beyond this, he seeks to dismantle the more extreme forms of postmodernism by analyzing the work of Derrida (deconstructing traditional meaning in language), Foucault (power establishes truth), and Rorty (pragmatist - whatever works is true).  It's not all critique though, Erickson lays out more coherent theories to counter these and shows how even the postmodern thinkers have to rest upon the more coherent theories they oppose to make their case at all.<br />While reading the book, I occasionally couldn't tell if Erickson was bothered by the less harmful effects of postmodernism (like casual dress in business and news telecasts that show the cameras and props, etc.) or just observing them.  Usually, he was more clear in giving sound critiques with detailed examples of lowered university standards, sloppy truth handling in the courts, the decline of morality in television and similar effects that are undermining our society.<br />The last chapter of the book is a fascinating glimpse into the future of the evangelical church in light of postmodernism written from the perspective of someone living in the future and looking back.  Erickson actually goes a little postmodern himself in the last chapter since it is brilliantly and entirely told from an individual's perspective. The practical ideas of how Christians can move forward accepting, but not compromising to, postmodernism given here alone are worth the purchase of the book.<br />To compliment this book with some more specific and practical responses to postmoderns objecting to the Christian faith, look at Paul Copan's &quot;That's Just Your Interpretation&quot;, and &quot;True for You, But Not For Me&quot;ual's perspective.

The author does a good job of presenting the views of various systems. Most of the charts have the well known related scriptures and short arguments for and against the view.<br />I think it could be a little better if it had a detailed subject index in the back, but the table of contents is sufficient.  It helps if the reader is familiar with the structure and topics of a systematic theology (prolegomena through eschatology). However, this is not the book for an depth study of any particular doctrine. It just helps you get the overall structure quickly. This is a good reference for the intermediate or early theology student. It's probably too terse for a true newcomer to theological studies but could be helpful soon after a little systematic study. This is not a criticism just something to be aware of before you purchase. It's a book of charts not detailed explanations.<br />For more meat get the Moody Handbook of Theology, by Pentecost, it's an excellent theology summary/introduction.  It originated and explains some of the best charts in this chart book. One other thing - this chart book does not describe various church denominational teachings/differences at all. For that see Handbook of Denominations in the United States, by Mead.	2004-05-06

Some of the best evangelical scholars do careful and calculated work to respond to the shoddy fabrication of Jesus that the Jesus Seminar seems so proud of. Having spent time reviewing the Seminar's The Five Gospels and The Complete Gospels among some of their other works, I am more convinced now that what the scholars in Jesus Under Fire have done is not only called for, but right on target.<br />The Seminar is inconsistent in the application of its own criteria and even more shocking to me was the lack of direct scholarly references and argumentation to document their conclusions. Their assumptions and academic credentials seem to authoritatively seal the case in their minds. These are exactly the type of weaknesses Jesus Under Fire demonstrates in the Seminar's reconstruction of Jesus. Unlike the Seminar's  translation and commentary, Jesus Under Fire is detailed, well argued and extensively footnoted.  Amazon provides a table of contents and other reviewers have already summarized this excellent book so I won't recover that ground.<br />Among my favorite articles are Bock's &quot;Live, Jive or Memorex&quot; which has helped me in explaining the historical nature of the Bible to some of my doubting friends.  I also love Geivett's &quot;Is Jesus The Only Way?&quot; which provides some original thoughts on how to approach our pluralistic society with the exclusive claims of Christ.  McKnight's introduction to Jesus Studies was helpful to me as I approached this arena. All of the articles are excellent.<br />With the increasing media coverage of the Jesus Seminar this is an important resource for biblical Christians who are thoughtful in their approach to the gospels.  The Jesus Seminar may be here for a long haul, but so are the responses presented in this great book.	2004-04-25
US	49109688	RCIJ1DNLKME9N	0310224764	613882282	Five Views on Apologetics	Books	4	6	7	N	N	An advance in apologetics, but not for the novice	I am a seminary student and I recently had the privilege of taking a course in apologetics methods taught by the editor of this book, Dr. Steve Cowan.  Steve is a fine man of God and a true expert in this area of comparing apologetics methods/religious epistemology.  The contents of the book have been outlined well in other reviews so I won't re-hash those.  There are a few points worth noting about this book and its topic.<br />1. This is not a book for someone looking for apologetics answers to use in their witnessing.  This is a scholarly book co-authored by some of the most powerful scholars in evangelical Christianity today. The dialog is mostly theological/philosophical and can be hard to follow.  Each of the scholars only has a few pages to sketch the main contours of their actual apologetic. The rest of their writing concerns the theoretical framework for that apologetic. This is expected as long as you understand the purpose of the book is to discuss meta-apologetics or \\"how we establish a framework for how we do apologetics.\\"  Some commercial book reviews seem to under-emphasize or miss this point and it is important since it could be a disappointment to someone just starting in their apologetics ministry.  You may want to do some study in the apologetics topic of Faith and Reason before tackling this book.  J.P. Moreland's \\"Love Your God With All Your Mind\\" is a good starter on Faith and Reason.<br />2. The debate over apologetic methodology primarily concerns positive case apologetics where the Christian is seeking a broad method for advancing the positive case in favor of Christianity, as opposed to answering or defending against objections to the faith.  Defending against specific objections almost always takes on a presuppositional tone where the apologist looks for underlying assumptions, fallacies or implications in the objection that weaken its effectiveness.  This book is not about mounting this type of defense, but rather, how we should architect an effective positive case in favor of Christian truth claims. There is some cross-over of course, but it is helpful to realize this about the book as you read it.  This high level point is assumed, but not often made within the book itself.<br />3. There is a significant convergence of thought that comes out within the interaction between the five panelists.  There are certainly some areas of disagreement, and a few sparks fly (!) but overall, the panel finds more common ground than has  traditionally been the case.  All of the panelists are respectful and constructive toward one another. In the Conclusion, Dr. Cowan outlines 6 points of commonality. For example, presuppositional apologist John Frame agrees to the existence of common epistemological ground with unbelievers.  Traditionally, the presuppositional view would not have conceded a point like this, but Frame shows he is his own scholar in many ways by also presenting an approach to help resolve the perennial complaint about obvious circularity in the presuppositional method.  The value of evidences and arguments was also agreed to among all the writers but as with most things it is a question of degree and emphasis.<br />4. Study of apologetic methodology is useful theoretical background for those who are called to apologetic ministry, but I for one am glad to see some of the common ground emerging after decades of theoretical discussion, writing and debate. Let's not get hung up here a lot longer, there's much Kingdom work to be done. I fear encouraging new apologists to commitment into one technical method or another can easily detract valuable resources from more practical, and yes Biblical, efforts.<br />This is a very good book on what I found to be a very challenging topic.  This book is unique in its bringing together leading proponents of each apologetic approach.  Another good book on this topic is Faith Has Its Reasons by Boa and Bowman.  It does not have the benefit of the exchanges between leading experts that Five Views provides, but it does have tremendous depth as a resource for the history of apologists, their methods and practical conversational examples for each approach.leading experts that Five Views provides, but it does have tremendous depth as a resource for the history of apologists, their methods and practical conversational examples for each approach.	2003-12-30

It is well written and tends to stay close to the Bible with only minimal departures.  I am a seminary student so I study different theological systems. This is not a technical or advanced commentary. It is very suitable for anyone trying to understand a particular set of verses.  In some cases it goes verse by verse, but in the Old Testament especially it is often paragraph to paragraph. This works out well for most uses.<br />McFarland is a mainstream evangelical interpreter of the Bible. He takes the Bible very literally - commenting from a dispensational, pre-millennial theology perspective. This is the perspective of the Left Behind series of books. If you are Baptist, Pentecostal or from a similar congregational denomination you will probably be very comfortable with this commentary; it likely fits the teaching of your church very well.  If you only plan to buy one full Bible commentary for your family this is a good choice.<br />Presbyterian, Lutheran and other Reformed backgrounds may want to consider something else if you plan to use it as a teaching resource. Though this is still a useful commentary on the key tenets of the faith, some important secondary doctrines do not agree with a Reformed view.  Matthew Henry of course is always a great choice but he is by no means as easy to read or contemporary as this much newer commentary.	2003-12-30

He definitely has an announcers voice and is easy to understand.  I found his inflections sort of larger-than-life/not natural at first but I quickly got acclimated, not a big issue.  The book is fairly long and repeats many important themes like the need for healthy culture, process and vision in many different ways. It might be able to be shorter.<br />The research method Jennings and his team utilized for the book is the driver that makes the book so interesting.  By carrying out detailed analysis to locate several under-the-radar, but incredibly productive companies, they managed to isolate some of the common threads for corporate success without being sucked into the vortex of large mega-companies whose stories are already well known and perhaps over-documented.  The companies chosen represent a fairly good cross-section of international business, but I would have like to have seen at least one very high tech computer vendor make the cut. There are probably good reasons why there wasn't one, but there was no mention of this if my memory serves... In addition to the excellent research on the case companies, there are also some good insights into legendary companies like Ford and Toyota briefly provided for specific instances.<br />The significant flaw in this book is that when it is taken as a whole, it amounts to not much more than a very interesting, carefully crafted, indictment of most executive management in corporations today.  The executives profiled all really know the nuts and bolts of their business and have been with them long enough to really cast Deming-like vision into reality. That plays well for well a while, but with 6 tapes, I'd like something more practical I can start at work tomorrow since I'm not an executive and probably never will be.  The book does try to service this need for mid-managers like me towards the end of the book by encouraging that we apply at least some of the key principles to some degree in the hope of making a grass roots difference at least within our department.  Actually, the department I work with abides by many of the principles given and they do help. But that doesn't stop large-scale lay-offs, frozen budgets and other realities that most managers really have to live with. The book's untitled theme is that strong success only flows from the top down.  In the highly successful cases analyzed, each has exceptional Level 5 leaders (to use Jim Collins terminology).  What if where I work is like 90% of all places where the executives turn-over a lot, are forced to optimize all decisions for short-term profit on Wall Street and de-rail some good plans due to economic realities?  The book's primary advice to me would seem to be: go to work somewhere else, find that 10% club.  Maybe true, but not particularly helpful today.<br />Even for those top-level executives whom this book will reach, it is likely to fall on deaf ears.  Not because executives really are the \\"wing tip shoe wearers, peacock strutting\\" jerks Jennings occasionally alludes to.  No, it is Jennings own inflammatory and derisive language that will tend to make executives shut the book.  I wanted to lend my tapes to the president of my company because of the good macro-productivity ideas, but decided I wouldn't because he might take it as my endorsement of this class-warfare attitude.<br />There are other sources out there for most of the information here on egalitarian culture, continuous process improvement, open-book management, profit sharing incentives, etc. I'd be interested to know the average working hours of the employees in the case study companies as a cultural factor but I don't recall this being mentioned.  In any case, the productivity measures would factor this in, just a cultural question I have about these companies.<br />Much of what Jennings says is true and interesting.  There are some things that can be learned here, but much of it comes downto re-invent almost everything, starting with your executives. Who can implement that?  Again, it is the detailed case study research that puts compelling value into this book.down to re-invent almost everything, starting with your executives. Who can implement that?

He never questions the staying power of the \\"unsinkable true Church\\" but strongly implicates the inability of the church to reproject the timeless message in new and relevant modes.  He lays the responsibility upon the leadership of the church.  Pastors are overworked and wearing too many hats, some of which they aren't gifted or trained for.<br />Much of the book is reminiscent of the 1990's vision-shaping management movement with its emphasis on mission statements and dynamic leader identification and training. There is certainly truth to be found in this, but the business world has learned through hard knocks that crisp execution can make up for second rate vision since business is graded on a Bell curve - the lesson may not be useful to the church, it certainly is murky  in a theological sense.<br />In 2003, Barna is talking about Strategic Sources of Influence (SSI) like the Internet and TV, etc. as the place needing emphasis. He feels this book is still his most important, but it wasn't well received/implemented (though I think some of the church growth movement has taken it to heart).<br />One of the problems the book has, and this is somewhat unfair to judge in hindsight, is that from the beginning it describes how our culture re-invents itself every 3-5 years. The book then builds around that premise as if it is deeply true and significant for minsitry on all fronts.  That may be true at the superficial pop culture level and media/technology outlets, but I don't think individuals literally revamp their deeply held  worldview assumptions that often.  Modernism and post modern relativism/pluralism are the patterns we will have for decades to come; they will just be in different clothing from time to time. I was disappointed Barna didn't stress pure apologetics more as this seemed to be a key, unstated assumption in many of his ministry strategies.<br />It's still a very good book, even today, and has influenced my thinking quite a bit.  The book is more about when and why we should change the church than what and how although there is some detail on growing leadership.is ministry strategies.<br />It's still a very good book, even today, and has influenced my thinking quite a bit.

Marvin Lubenow is one such young-earth creationist.  In an era with much important writing (and predictable controversy) in the intelligent design arena, Lubenow offers back-to-the-basics analysis of the so-called \\"hominid fossils\\" that are the backbone of the human evolution story.<br />Lubenow challenges the naturalistic assumption that important fossils are few and far between.  Instead, Lubenow considers a very wide range of human fossils and systematically explains how most of the well-known fossils such as Java Man, Homo erectus and Neanderthals have been misinterpreted by the entrenched, circular institution of evolutionary sciences as multimillion-year-old hominid ancestors.  To take the case further, the author carefully compares the morphology of these fossils (anatomical shape of skulls, femurs, etc.) and other associated evidence, like fossilized tools, to show these important specimens are best described as modern humans.<br />The overall organization of the book is somewhat confusing, but there are multiple chapters that progress nicely within themselves.  Chapters One through Four discuss the methods of analysis used by evolutionists and by Lubenow.  The words of an evolutionist must be carefully considered because, \\"While he is certainly not telling the truth, in his own mind, he is not lying. He is speaking a different language, and the public has not learned the translation\\" (p. 32).  Numerous quotations of technical evolutionary language that avoid problems in data are provided throughout the book.<br /> In chapters Five through Seven, various well-known fossil hominids are scrutinized to demonstrate the \\"magic-wand\\" that evolutionists use to make various fossil finds conform to whatever evolutionary theory needs to be supported.  In many cases, the public was subjected to a public relations campaign about the importance of the find even before mainstream evolutionists scrutinized the evidence.  Further, human evolution can actually be falsified on its own criteria from the fossil evidence.  \\"If Homo erectus people persisted long after they should have died out\\" or \\"if one could show fossils indistinguishable from modern humans existed long before they were supposed to exist...this also would falsify the concept\\" (p. 48).  The book seeks to meet both of these challenges to devastate the theory of human evolution on both the timeline and anatomy of the fossil evidence.<br />Chapters Eight through Eleven detail the work of Eugene Dubois, whose Java Man find in 1891 became the hallmark transitional form of twentieth century evolution.  Lubenow documents his reasons for being highly critical of the methods and even scientific ethics of Dubois relating to Java Man and his other finds. Despite the shoddy methods, \\"Java man was eventually accepted as our evolutionary ancestor in spite of the evidence because he could be interpreted to promote evolution\\" (p. 87).<br />The wildly varying fossil record of Homo erectus is analyzed in chapters Twelve and Thirteen and shown to cover an incredible range of dates even by the evolutionists' own estimates.  The skull morphology and other non-circular evidence actually establish that Home erectus was fully human and left fossil specimens everywhere in the alleged timeline.  Chapter Fourteen provides a young-earth creationist's explanation of the Ice Age that followed the Flood of Noah and how this event affected dietary and other health-related concerns to affect the morphology of human fossils, especially Neanderthal.  Chapters Fifteen and Sixteen extensively document, and chart, how Homo habilis and other fossils actually falsify the evolutionists' account because of tools, footprints, and the recurring theme of \\"fossils that are indistinguishable from modern humans[that] can be traced all the way back to 4.5 m.y.a, according to the evolution time scale\\" (p. 178).<br />The final chapters touch on various subjects of interest to science and theology, such as ethics, the Big Bang, the TOLeDOT structure of Genesis, and the various evangelical views of origins.  Lubenow concludes his work with an Appendix on the use of radiometric dating methods often so important to evolutionists.  The Appendix is essentially a critique of the ten-year controversy concerning the 1967-69 KBS Tuff finds in Kenya.  Radiometric dating is shown to be highly subjective, often inaccurate, and even irrelevant to evolutionists when it produces disagreeable results for evolutionary theory.<br />Marvin Lubenow has provided a technical book that is enjoyable to read and presents the fruit of decades invested doing original research and analysis on evolution.  Most of the book is a critique of the methods of evolution, but there is also a considerable amount of new interpretation for the \\"Bones of Contention\\".mans [that] can be traced all the way back to 4.5 m.y.a, according to the evolution time scale\\" (p. 178).<br />The final chapters touch on various subjects of interest to science and theology, such as ethics, the Big Bang, the TOLeDOT structure of Genesis, and the various evangelical views of origins.

It is written from a Protestant/evangelical perspective but still gives adequate treatment to many other views including Roman Catholicism, liberal theologies and significant historical positions.  Includes dozens of useful charts, some of which I have seen reprinted in other theology texts.<br />I particularly like the way the author develops the various layers of theological work starting with exegesis and biblical theology as the underpinning for systematics, dogmatics then contemporary etc. These relationships were not clear to me until I saw them in this book.<br />If you study theology to any degree, and especially if you are just starting to study it, this is dollar for dollar one of the best books you can invest in. Each topic is treated briefly but with sufficent depth to clarify the various views to help make further study fruitful.  There are many lists of other works in the chapter end notes - also has a good subject index. I love this book and expect to continue using it often.	2003-12-30

This book is defintely my favorite in this category and one of my all-time favorites.  Merrill uses specific examples from history to show that the 'Good 'Ol Days' are largely a myth. Enacting more laws will not change hearts and neither will painting our Bibles red-white and blue (metaphorically) by trying to Americanize the gospel with revisionist history. Of course we have problems today...There have been problems ever since the Fall. Unbeleivers still act like unbeleivers. Why are we surprised? Some Christians act like unbelievers - that should surprise us.<br />Merrill is always reverent and uses our Lord as the prototype He's meant to be. This book reminds Christians to really be salt and light with practical ideas that sometimes call for sacrifice and always require reflection.  We are meant to be much more than moralizing custodians of the culture.  We are to transform it with love, involvement and yes, with standards of behavior - that we apply first to ourselves - just like Jesus did. Merrill is on target to tell the Church that romanticizing the past is just a distraction keeping us from really engaging the culture by &quot;speaking the truth in love.&quot;  I love this book - we can be conservative and not be mad about it.	2003-12-30
US	49109688	RU5ZMAMDZLGAG	0060652926	338167986	Mere Christianity	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Nothing Mere about it !	Sometimes a classic is remembered only as a classic and not for what made it a classic. Sometimes a generation passes and one of its greatest voices is remembered by name only.  For some people, re-reading a classic may refresh their mind and heart with a book enjoyed long ago. For others, the classic book is a new conversation with timeless ideas.  Mere Christianity is a classic, and C.S. Lewis is still a great voice echoing to new generations.<br /> Mere Christianity was first published in 1952 as a compilation of books and responses to questions produced from a four-part series of radio broadcasts that Lewis gave during World War II; consequently, the book has four sections corresponding to the radio series.<br />The short chapters in Mere Christianity are brilliantly written and enjoyable to read. Each chapter progresses through a tour of Christian beliefs and practices for the unbeliever who is honestly interested in understanding Christianity. Objections are dealt with as they logically arise.  Throughout the book, Lewis is constructing a case to prove that Christianity is a logical response to the questions of our lives. Like a lawyer in court, he persuades us through the cumulative weight of his case, never getting ahead of himself.  He also proves he is a master of the hypothetical example that clarifies a difficult idea.  Mere Christianity is a treasure trove of amazing anecdotes that can be remembered and shared with those seeking answers about Christianity.<br />The first section, \\"Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe,\\" begins by observing that a certain degree of morality is common among men.  Nature has checks and balances that any culture can use to gauge proper behavior.  The author calls this condition \\"Moral Law\\" and establishes that it must exist as an absolute standard.  If no final standard exists, Lewis argues \\"there would be no sense in preferring civilized morality to savage morality, or Christian morality to Nazi morality\\" (p.25).  Moral Law is shown to be the effect of a higher cause, which is tentatively called \\"God\\" at this point in the book.<br />Section two, \\"What Christians Believe,\\" uses reason to eliminate competing views of God such as pantheism, dualism, atheism and other variants.  The problem of evil is dealt with primarily by reason of universal morality or justice.  Lewis asks for the basis of any claim calling God unjust if there is no absolute standard of just and unjust to begin with.  Free will, mans' fallen condition, and the relationship between faith and works are used to show the necessity of the gospel.  Only God, through Christ's sacrifice, could restore the relationship with man since, as Lewis says - \\"the worse you are the more you need it and the less you can do it.  The only person who could do it perfectly would be a perfect person - and he would not need it\\" (p.60).<br /><br />The third section, \\"Christian Behavior,\\" explains that Christian duty and outward behavior is an expected consequence of the spiritual influence of Christ.  The four \\"cardinal\\" virtues of prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude are observed as they occur both inside and outside of Christianity.  The chapters on sexual morality and Christian marriage are very insightful and are as accurate as if they were written yesterday.  Pride is called \\"The Great Sin\\" and is presented in a manner consistent with the Bible.  Pride is the central problem in human history and is a spiritual vice from Hell, delivered to us by Satan who is also full of pride.<br />The final section, \\"Beyond Personality: Or First Steps in the Doctrine of the Trinity,\\" is the most theological part of the book.  Lewis stays close to the Bible throughout most of the discussion but does not use it as part of his case. Theology is shown to be both practical and important. The theological nature of Jesus is unique among all men since he was begotten and not just created.  The book concludes by showing that what seemsso simple and unlikely is, in fact, the most powerful force the earth will ever know.  When the case built throughout the book is complete, we see that giving up our corrupted lives to partake in the perfect life of Christ is the most consistent and realistic response we could ever have to our human condition.<br />Lewis writes from deep within his heart on all subjects.  You may not agree with every statement made in the book, but you will laugh aloud frequently and understand \\"Mere Christianity\\" in a new way.  Mere Christianity isn't \\"mere\\" at all.t seems so simple and unlikely is, in fact, the most powerful force the earth will ever know.

His reputation for innovative ideas, especially in servant evangelism and seeker awareness is well-earned.  For this book, Sjogren has reflected on his many years of ministerial experience and lays out a new case for what most churches should be striving to achieve.  One interesting and often overlooked insight is that mega-churches are often built around one key, super-leader.  This may work well in those isolated cases, but the formula is not repeatable no matter how many conference sessions attempt to make it so.  Instead, small (struggling) churches, defined as less than 200 in membership, should not aim for the stars, but for the next fruitful plateau which the author defines as being in the 300-500 member range.  Size itself is de-emphasized in this book with the focus instead being on making many effective community oriented churches. Sjogren says these days he would prefer 12 500-member churches that are well attuned to various communities in a city over one 6000 member mega-church.  The Perfectly Imperfect Church is so named because its perfection lies in the fact it is an effective, kingdom-through-community-oriented church, not a giant postcard perfect one that is polished to a high gloss.<br />After laying out the background motivation and vision for the book, Sjogren paints a portrait of the Perfectly Imperfect (or Pretty Good) Church in thirteen short chapters. Each chapter is focused on a Path for creating an effective mid-size church.<br />Path1 is to keep it all \\"Simple\\" by being basic and service minded in virtually every aspect.  Path 2 points the church \\"Upward\\" to God with worship that is authentic, inviting and intertwined with evangelism.  Path 3 points the church \\"Outward\\" towards consistent and real evangelism that is simple enough to work.  Path 4 is \\"Anointed\\", or authentic embodiment of service to others as a way of showing Christ's love to them.  Path 5 is to have \\"Fun\\" by lightening up a bit and even being silly sometimes.  Path 6 Provides excellent details on how to make church \\"Safe\\", in numerous ways, so people can focus on God.  Path 7 is to be \\"Inclusive\\" by seeing Christian life as cycling through the 4 stages of hospital, family, school and army. There are no completely arrived Christians that no longer need these 4 stages. Path 8 is to make \\"Trusting\\" small groups; good hands on details here about leading a small group.  Path 9 is to be \\"Atmospheric\\" in a way that makes the church experience inviting in every conceivable category.<br /> Path 10 is to be Generous in all directions, including towards other churches in need of help.  Generosity is considered the most important of the 13 Paths.  Path 11 is my favorite part of the book where \\"True\\" is described in three circles of 1) essential doctrine all Christians need to hold in order to be Christian, 2) tradition that various denominations will hold, and 3) opinions, which abound among individuals.  The point is to not squabble over non-essentials because it hurts the overall cause of Christ.  Path 12 is having the Perfectly Imperfect church be \\"Cooperative\\" within the \\"Big Church\\" - that is, the whole church Christ recognizes.  Path 13 Re-emphasizes an outward focus among leaders who should be \\"Leading Out\\".  It's a lot of chapters, but each is small, enjoyable and packed with useful ideas.<br />Though he is theologically conservative, I think Sjogren is open to the charge leveled against many contemporary church engineers that they are too pragmatic in their approach to ministry.  I occasionally see this in the book when the author tells pastors to be sure they pay special attention to musicians in the congregation since they may be needed later, prescribing 22 minutes of worship since attention spans are short, or keeping prayers super short for people who chronically need pastoral attention. There are many similar examples. These do not sit well with me but conscience reminds me that the author has sacrificed a lot more to help hurting people, spread the gospel and strengthen churches than most Christians, certainly including me. Am I now the one being too pragmatic? I don't think so. He is a servant doing much for the Kingdom and I have taken to heart alot of what he says. If extreme pragmatism in ministry bothers you, this book may bother you (in places).  I enjoyed the book and wouldn't mind reading more of his work.

The author has good information about various large, fallen societies through history and his interpretations of the historical data are interesting.  After the first few chapters however, I began to wonder if he may be unintentionally reading our contemporary situations into his interpretation of historical events - the parallels are very detailed and almost uncanny.  Of course, that is one of the main points of his book so I give him some benefit of the doubt since his historical knowledge dwarfs mine.<br />However, beyond this historical information and first level analysis, I felt much of the book was too dire, alarmist even.  Again, he speaks from his heart and I think he is trying to wake up our divided society, especially Christians, which isn't a bad idea overall.  His tone is just too overstated in my opinion.  There is also a lack of specific advice about what to do except for general suggestons like voting responsibly etc.  As an evangelical Christian I am sympathetic to the author's cause. I strongly prefer Dean Merrill's Sinners in the Hands of an Angry Church, over this book for a more reflective look at how we can be swept up in the &quot;good ol days&quot; thinking.  Don Eberly's Restoring the Good Society is a pretty good book that is similar to When Nations Die but much more constructive.	2003-12-15

He is right on the money.  I was introduced to evolution in high school and college biology courses but further confused by television shows that are all over the map and all claiming to support evolution.  I am a Christian Creationist but I do not hesitate to recommend this book for those interested in seeing a coherent account of evolution told by a true expert in the field.  Mayr did not change my mind about macroevolution, but he did help me clear up a lot of my thinking about the current state of both evolutionary and creation science.  I view the book as a very informative explanation, even a defense, of contemporary evolutionary thought.  Mayr's gradualism is presented as the contemporary extension of Darwin's first revolution 150 years ago and of the evolutionary synthesis of the 1940's that brought molecular biology into the evolutionary fold.  Other views of evolution and creation through the past 200 years are contrasted to Mayr's well-developed vision of how life gradually evolves.  He generally builds a positive case for his position rather than directly attacking others.<br />Since Amazon has the technology to show the table of contents I will only summarize the contents of the book in an alternative way that Mayr himself hints at throughout the book.  Chapters 1-4 are largely observations from the living world that suggest some sort of evolutionary process is at work. Chapter 5 devotes a lot of pages to modern theories of genetics and inheritance.  Chapters 5-7 describe processes occurring within populations of living organisms.  Throughout the book, Mayr stresses that diversity among populations, rather than unity of types, is the prevailing lesson of evolutionary biology.  Chapters 5-9 form a major unit that describes the various mechanisms of microevolution including speciation.  Chapters 10-12 get into higher-level macroevolution and use humans as a case study of mosaic evolution in a social species.  I found these final chapters the least convincing and poorly backed by evidence (though it is well written and interesting to read).  Mayr often admits the fossil record, especially for humans, is sketchy proof for evolution. To his credit he builds much of his case around observable biology rather than sketchy paleontology.  Marvin Lubenow's \\"Bones of Contention\\" is an interesting and detailed analysis of the hominid fossils for those open to a very different (creationist) perspective.<br />Though I find much to disagree with in the philosophical assumptions and in some leaps of naturalistic faith used in the book, I think it serves its intended audience very well.  The book could be better if it had more footnotes for further reading, especially to fossil statements and other phenomena such as rafting reptiles, teeth in baleen whale embryos etc.  The bibliography is very extensive and Mayr does provide a list of anti-creationist books so the info can probably be located in those. If you are not well versed in biology and genetics you will probably want a dictionary handy, but this is exactly the sort of book I wanted as a deep introduction.

The book could be better if it had more footnotes for further reading, especially to fossil statements and other phenomena such as rafting reptiles, teeth in baleen whale embryos etc.  The bibliography is very extensive and Mayr does provide a list of anti-creationist books so the info can probably be located in those. If you are not well versed in biology and genetics you will probably want a dictionary handy, but this is exactly the sort of book I wanted as a deep introduction. Mayr is an honest, balanced and gifted writer for his position.	2003-12-01

I work in workflow systems development and I think this book provides a thorough yet practical vision of the next generation of business process systems.  This book will likely launch a thousand ships with many winners among them. You do not have to be highly technical  to get a lot from this book.  In fact, it is written for business managers who have some sense of enterprise IT and its impact, both good and bad, in corporations.  The authors rightly emphasize some of the current failings in IT and stress that much of the problem is the inflexibility of systems to adapt in the rapidly changing climate of business.  Managers need to have control of the overall business processes to adjust quickly, but cannot because business processes are often &quot;baked&quot; into existing IT applications.  The authors point to many examples in business history and in current pioneering efforts to show that managing business processes is a determinative factor of success. While this may sound obvious, the solution offered is potentially profound.  Business Process Management Systems, or BPMS, are already being sold and deployed in real life environments and yielding benefits. While the authors admit that their full vision will only be realized in the decades to come, there is much that can begin today.  Since the book is not highly technical, the authors do not address some of the hairier issues in systems integration (entity ontology for example) but they do outline their key assumptions such as the requirement for legacy integration (one time per system) and the pressing need for business process engineering/analysts.  They also assume widespread adoption of a single process definition language. This will of course happen but probably not until after the various players try to sway the market towards their own standards.  There are very good appendixes for the technical person and business manager alike.  I love the book and recommend it highly.  This book is short, insightful and packed with information from a variety of disciplines that are woven together to support the authors' primary assertions about IT for the coming decade(s). What is exotic today could well become a necessity tomorrow.s manager alike.  I love the book and recommend it highly.

Hoekema has a great writing style that is suitable for a wide audience.  He definitely writes from the Reformed perspective but does not interpret as figuratively as Berkhof for example (but more so than Ladd). He rarely, if ever, cites confessions or creeds to support his position.  He does quote other theologians extensively and fairly. Generally sound reasoning from the scriptures with minimal speculating.<br />The early part of the book has a useful Historical Survey of various theologians (Aquinas, Calvin, Barth, others) and their view on man in the image of God.  Hoekema is fair and looks for the good points in various views as well as kindly pointing out errors.<br />Later in the book he shows he is his own thoelogian by critquing both the trichotomy (soul and spirit distinct) and dichotomy (soul and spirit inseparable) views of the constitution of man.  Hoekema argues for man as a whole (body-soul-spirit) integrated  person and encourages us to share the gospel of Christ(the perfect image bearer) in a manner respecting this proper view of our fellow man, who, though fallen like all of us, also reflects some aspects of God's image (James 3:9).<br />Pretty extensive bibliography, subject, name and scripture indexes; what you expect of a true theology text.<br />A good and edifying read. God blessed us with an excellent teacher in Hoekema (who is now with the Lord). I would like to read another of his works sometime.  John 15:5	2002-05-01
