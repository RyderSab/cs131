While sometimes overbearingly academic, Jabour has a crisp analytical style that makes us understand immediately the social relationship between the Wirts and its applicability to our own  intimate relationships.  Personal/analytical history of this kind helps us  comprehend the &quot;real people&quot; of the past, their environment, and  how they operated within it &amp; rebelled against it.  Many parallels to  today.  Jabour helps convey the fact often hidden from all of us  ethno-centric &amp; generation-centric readers that people live ordinary  lives in all times &amp; places, even if their environment seems  incomprehensible to us, in the suburban US, in the last decade of the 20th  century.  Having read this book, I plan to move on to the 3 other volumes  in the series, namely: Angel Kwolek-Folland, &quot;Engendering Business:  Men &amp; Women in the Corporate Office, 1870-1930;&quot; Creighton &amp;  Norling, &quot;Iron Men, Wooden Women: Gender &amp; Seafaring in the  Atlantic World 1700-1920;&quot; Stephen Frank, &quot;Life with Father:  Parenthood &amp; Masculinity in the 19th Century American North.&quot;	1999-08-25

What was the context of politics &amp; political debate?  How did politicians &amp; politically-involved citizens jockey for position in the rough &amp; tumble  world of public policy?  Can we learn lessons about today's political world  from bygone days, more than 150 years in the past?  This superb volume  answers all of the foregoing and much more.  I agree with the other  reviewer that it is very detailed, not for the casual reader of history,  but I am also annoyed by the Kirkus review's last sentence about  &quot;hardy&quot; readers.  Don't be scared off from the book by that  comment.  If you are interested in the dynamics of political debate today,  this book contains many lessons.  If you are interested in 19th century  history &amp; politics, particularly of the antebellum period, this book is  a &quot;must&quot; for your personal library.	1999-07-23

This is not one of them.  Goodwin just rambles along with no organization, no clear themes,  etc.  Journalists -- which I believe Goodwin must be -- should not write  history.

Klein  is an excellent writer, in contrast to many Civil War book writers -- good  at choosing words, sentence structure, chapter design, thesis statements,  etc.  So you never feel &quot;lost&quot; in the book.  I would place this  book in the top 10 or so about the period.	1999-06-26

I especially like Carrie Brown's skillful interweaving of the plot, past &amp; present, as the story went on.  Although some book reviewers have made much of the ghost aspect of the  book, it plays a fairly minor role, really ... more of a catalyst to the  main character's thoughts about the past than a central feature of every  page.  The relationship of the main character to his pigeons, and to his  father in law through the pigeons was what I thought was the most exciting  &amp; interesting part of the book. This volume is another successful  choice by Amazon competitor, Barnes &amp; Noble, in its first novel series.   I haven't gone wrong yet in this series, although some of the books were  stronger than others.	1999-05-11

I do not believe that Hughes is the &quot;devil  incarnate&quot; responsible for Sylvia's emotional problems ... some of the  other reviewers here are completely hung-up, decades later, on assigning  Hughes the responsibility for Plath's suicide (not that she didn't already  have some psychological problems going in).  How about judging Hughes for  his own emotions &amp; literary merit.  It's not like he ruined the life of  8 friends, singlehandedly, like Elia Kazan.  It's not like he was a rapist,  like Arthur Koestler.	1999-04-07

Juan Williams  is a very good writer, the prose is &quot;breezy&quot; and the book is a  fast read laden with interesting characters &amp; interesting gossip.  It  shows Marshall's central place in 20th century, indeed US historical, civil  rights in various arenas, not just racial justice.  He is a very appealing  person as well ... someone any reader probably would enjoy having known.  I  noticed in the forward that Williams was prevented from talking to some of  the people closest to Marshall, which is most unfortunate.  The book is not  an expose but a very favorable view of the man.  Marshall's relatives  should be kicking themselves for not having shared their views &amp;  experiences with Williams.  The next biographer will almost certainly be a  more critical writer than Williams.  Where the book falls down is in its  exposition of Marshall's thought &amp; some of the details of his legal  work.  So we come away, unfortunately, not understanding that Marshall was  an intellectual giant, not just a legal-oriented civil rights leader.  I  enjoyed this book very much but gave it only 3 stars because it is almost  entirely missing Marshall's intellectual life.	1999-04-05

Not since John Womack's &quot;Zapata &amp; the Mexican Revolution&quot; 2 decades ago has such a scholarly, well-written, moving account of the Mexican Revolution found its way into english.  The  book was, obviously, a labor of love and the labor of a career for Katz,  who must have mined every possible source to generate a full-blooded  picture of Villa himself, how he fit into the revolution, and the  revolution'sown history.  The book's length is formidable &amp;  off-putting, but not a difficult read at all ... I would recommend that  people who might be scared off by its size try reading the first 50 pages  or so before they conclude it is just too lengthy.  I think most of you  will find yourselves drawn in during that first immersion, and end-up  buying (or taking it out of the library).	1999-03-19

Malone was a great stylist -- which is to say his sentences are beautifully crafted -- but also  well-organized, good at presenting hypotheses &amp; supporting  argumentation, without swallowing the reader up in the arguments. And he  knows the period &amp; the other personalities extremely well.  Since the  books were written pretty long ago, starting in the 1940s, they are missing  some of the recent, very good &quot;revisionism&quot; that has come along.   To supplement this magnificent work, then, I would recommend the Joseph  Ellis book and the Annette Gordon Reed book.  The Ellis book is a sort of  psychobiography that helps to show the internal contradictions in the man's  thought.  Jefferson was a more complex man than many of our founding  fathers and later leaders, more intellectual &amp; more self-deluded ...  something that Ellis shows well.  Ellis also is able to bring out some  aspects of Jefferson's personality so you feel like you know him better,  know him more personally, than Malone was able to do.  Of course, the Reed  book brings forth the incontrovertable evidence (I think) of Jefferson's  relationship with Sally Hemings, indeed the high probability that he  fathered 5 kids by her and must have had more than just a purely sexual  relationship with her, that is absent really from both Malone &amp; Ellis.   Read all three of these works.  But start with Malone.  It's well worth  reading all of the volumes in the set.	1999-03-09

He provides a good summary of the issues that surrounded the impeachments of  Chase &amp; Johnson, the constitutional questions these events raised &amp;  helped to settle, and their long-term implications.  Rehnquist is not, in  this book anyhow, the best stylist in the world, but he also doesn't  descend into so much legal mumbo-jumbo that non-lawyers would be turned  off.  Also, his sections of background history are just OK.  History buffs  may find some factual, emphasis or interpretative points to dispute in  those sections.	1999-03-07

This book is different, as my  5-star rating denotes.  Postrel has a &quot;system&quot; for evaluating  ideas, and marshals her miscellaneous anecdotes very well to support her  arguments.  So you come to the end of the book, and you have a usable way  of thinking about the world, rather than a jumble of stories.  Postrel  keeps your interest and only rarely falls into the &quot;preachy&quot;  style typical of this literature.  The book is not a heavy text, and could  actually be read in a single or, at most, two sittings.  I had my company  library buy the book and plan to circulate it around to my colleagues.	1999-02-19

I thought the book was designed for readers with short attention spans &amp; no taste for  scholarly history, however well-written.  The book has many scholarly-type  facts strewn about its pages, in no particular order &amp; with no  particular line of argument.  But it doesn't seem to bring any startling  new &amp; interesting interpretation to these facts.  Not quite clear on  why a jury thought this was one of the year's best books.  But I though  &quot;A Civil Action&quot; was a similar book that received such critical  plaudits too.	1999-02-02

We get a full-featured view of  Garrison as a human being &amp; family man, as an agitator, and,  importantly, Mayer is able to put him into historical context very well.   The first 2/3 of the book are the best.  I found the narrative dragged some  after that, in part because Garrison's role as an original firebrand had  faded by then.  I highly recommend this book.	1999-01-04

Actually, I can't imagine a better way to &quot;consume&quot; this volume than listening to it.

I have been all the poorer for not having discovered his masterful works prior to the Nobel Committee this year.  His &quot;imagining&quot; of a  world in which all, save one, go blind, and the consequences ... is at once  a fascinating &amp; intellectually challenging allegory, and very  believable.  I even found myself dreaming about being blind (I was  listening on tape to the Helen Keller bio. at the same time, just by  coincidence!!), with a creamy sheen to it rather than darkness.  I am now  going to launch off into his other books.	1998-12-08

Dorothy Herrman is a good, if not spectacularly readable writer.  The book's  weakness is that it fails to place Helen in her times sufficiently ...  giving only hints as to what was happening to blind education, charity  politics &amp; other &quot;social&quot; issues in which she lived.  There  are probably other books that cover that ground.  In contrast to some of  the other reviewers, I found the book insufficiently analytical, not overly  analytical.  And I did not find anything in it that was overly speculative  either.  Indeed, the author is always at pains to indicate when she is  &quot;speculating,&quot; rather than hiding such things in commentary.	1998-12-08

Very satisfying writing style.  Not a heavy, analytical or broad historical approach -- which is a  weakness &amp; a strength at the same time.  The strength is that you learn  about Keller's life &amp; relationships &amp; a bit about her inner life.   The weakness is that you learn very little about the events of the time  (e.g., Wobblies, treatment of the blind &amp; the deaf, educational  approaches, etc.) in which Keller &amp; Annie Sullivan lived.  Book is very  much worth reading nevertheless.  I am certain that there is another  volume, elsewhere, that covers that broader perspective (but perhaps not  with such good coverage of Keller's life).	1998-11-28

Lukacs does an excellent job showing how the &quot;biases&quot; of different historians and the material to which they have access have a  critical impact on how they interpret their subjects.  Lukacs is quite  even-handed, to the point of showing how even the generally-repudiated  &quot;friends-of-Hitler&quot; type historians do bring something to the  table -- certainly exaggerated but still having a kernel of truth.  Lukacs  is also an excellent writer.  The book is well-organized and never boring.	1998-11-17

Perhaps the most scandalous event in AM HIST survey books that involved these people was the  Burr/Hamilton duel.  Rogow's book brings the details behind their rivalry  to the reader's attention.  The book's weakness is that it is too heavy on  historiography -- with Rogow trotting out all the the evidence &amp;  commenting on whether it is robust or not, the narrator's biases and so  forth. Another weakness, I felt, was the heavy-handed &amp; sometimes  questionable use of psychobiography, especially in the early part of the  book.  A final weakness that affected readability was the fact that neither  person, Burr or Hamilton, seems very likeable to our &quot;liberated&quot;  20th century eyes.   That cannot, of course, be laid at Rogow's  feet.<br />Despite the 3-star rating, I do recommend the book.  So long as the  reader can be patient enough to slough through the historiography -- or if  you like that style of writing.	1998-11-12

The book is both a scholarly work and highly readable for the layman.  Miller provides a modicum of &quot;modern parallels&quot; and  editorial asides that would, if they weren't so intelligent, be  inappropriate.  As it is, his observations along these lines as the book  progresses makes the work more interesting rather than less.  This book is  more interesting that last year's biography of John Quincy Adams, which I  also enjoyed.	1998-11-12

Ron Chernow has achieved this feat with all 3 of the books I have read by him -- the Rockefeller  book, the Morgan book and this book.  This volume resonated with me more  than the others since I am jewish, and since a number of my ancestors were  assimilationist german jews (but never of the magnitude of the Warburgs!).   The foolishness &amp; the triumphs of this extended family would have made  interesting reading even without the context of world events, but that's  what makes the difference between a fair book and a great book.  Chernow is  particularly good at weaving in the world events without sounding ponderous  or pedantic.	1998-10-31

A ream of books about WWI told from the perspective of  participants, fiction-like &amp; yet nonfiction.  Her books are still in  print, in Penguin editions, in the UK.  This book, 1914, gives the reader  an superb view of what it was like to be British, on the front-lines in the  early months of war, on the home-front as a civilian (in England) or on the  home-front as an aspiring soldier.

The former, the book under review here, really brought things to life in a way you usually encounter in fiction &amp; rarely in history.  The New Yorker complained about the excessive detail ... but it was not.  An understanding of the details (like the Spanish reclassifying their 50 year old ships as new Class I battleships) is critical to understanding the war.  Highly recommended.	1998-06-24

All you have to do is compare the narrative style of old-timer &quot;adventure&quot; writers like Hemingway, Conrad and yes, even Fitzgerald, to see that Leonard is second rate.
