Perceived Racists, Government officials out for personal gain,crooked financial manipulators. This time he seems to combine it all with a plot reaching up to the U.S. Senate, Military Black Budgets and insider stock trading. Nevertheless, the book holds ones attention as the pages fly by.	2005-10-08

Plenty of excitement,quick page turning and suspense. There were a lot of pages, 575, but the author had plenty of time to develop the characters and the plot. Quite a St. Patrick's Day for all involved!	2005-09-14
US	44006207	R1OOX4WAJZ76CR	0451184793	656932309	The Vulture Fund	Books	3	0	0	N	Y	Unrealistic Thriller	Most of Stephen Frey's novels have the common thread of big time financial dealings. He manages to come up with different twists,  plots and characters. This one is about a top Wall Street firm where the Senior Partner is planning to make billions thru devious and quite illegal means. Along the way we find the head of the CIA,who is running for President, implicated. Terrorists take over a nuclear facility as part of the scheme. Mace McLain is the hero in this read. He suffers from something common in Frey's writing. His hero's are just too <br />perfect and superhuman to be believable. Still, it's not a horrible read. But, not top notch.	2005-09-05

It is controlled by top political figures who are using it to advance their agenda. Bo Hancock, the adopted son,of an incredibly wealthy family is the prime character. He manages the multibillion dollar family investment fund. He is exiled to the West because of  concern that he is just too smart and too honest to deal with. But, naturally he returns to carry on the good fight. This book is a fairly exciting read. But, Frey tends to write his key figures as being virtually unbelievable. They are just a bit too perfect. Past that point, it's a good,quick,exciting read.	2005-08-22

Erich Radek managed to survive the War and become an important businessman in Austria. He served US intelligence by being part of the Gehlen network. To add another twist to the story, his secret son, was the leading candidate of a rightist political party running for Chancellor. Lot's of excitement and quick page turning.	2005-08-18
US	44006207	R3O7QMLIVLP2K7	0451190157	159875656	The Legacy	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Frey At His Best	This book has received quite mixed reviews. However,to my taste, I considered it to be quite compelling. I really hated to put it down. Basically it's a story about a Bond trader who seems headed towards ruin. His father, who he really didn't know and was a covert DIA agent left him a video tape of the Kennedy assassination which proved there had been a conspiracy. The current President, in cahoots with the Mafia boss, were working together to keep the truth hidden. Tremendous drama, thrills and excitement along the way.	2005-08-14

This is a pretty good fast moving quick read. It keeps your attention. The only quarrel I have is the main character, Jay West, seems to be just too perfect to be believable. He just too much of a good guy who's constantly outfoxing the bad guys. Still, it's a good read.	2005-08-11

I enjoyed previous novels by Christopher Hyde and bought this based on them. But, unfortunately, this was a very tedious slow paced read. Even with appearances by Ian Fleming and James Bond. There were a few good parts. But it was really too painful to get to them.	2005-07-13

My favorites were the WWII thrillers. But, his crime books are top notch. This one is no exception. Even though it was written back in the '60's and recently reprinted it keeps your complete attention as you quickly turn the pages.  This was about a sculptor turned serial killer. Plenty of excitement.	2005-06-21

This is a rather unusual story of how a very successful lawyer loses his position,his wife and his son as a result of accidentially poisoning a young guest at a birthday sleepover party. Then strange twists develop involving a promising former baseball rookie who was coincidentally also poisoned-- by herbicides--his(the baseball players)quest to make contact with his daughter, major real estate transactions, a violent rap type club owner,and the goings on at a private room of an old steak house where things seem to come together.

Determined police work ultimately saves the Pope who is visiting New York City and conducting New Year's services at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Plenty of action.	2005-06-13

They rob banks to finance their activities and steal two new hi-tech nuclear devices from a train to blow up the ZOG government. Our hero manages to quickly have sex with at least three attractive women,become an unwilling accomplice in the bank robberies and help the US government get back the nukes! Realistic?

I particularly enjoyed his views on pitchers. As he compared the great pitchers of the past, who often pitched complete games,  such as Sandy Koufax,Robin Roberts,Steve Carlton,Bob Gibson,Warren Spahn and Juan Marichal to the present world that is dominated by pitch counts--middle relievers,set up men and closers. He also discusses how todays stars tend to be bigger and stronger. He has great insight into the changes of our national past time.	2005-06-03

By my count there are 55 different contributors included. Most of the stories are just several pages in length so that makes for quick reading. As might be expected the quality of the writers is somewhat uneven. Frequently there are quite dramatic events being recounted that certainly maintain the readers attention. All in all--quite an interesting read.	2005-06-01

Was a highly decorated marine during the Vietnam era. A recipient of the Navy Cross and served as Secretary of the Navy. He has been there. This novel takes us thru true cold war brinksmanship with a totally amok Chinese leader who pushes the world very close to WWIII. He is met by a strong willed U.S. President who will not be intimidated. Some of the scenarios may seem barely plausible.But, because of James Webb's background, who is to say what may happen in the world of special operations? Good stuff.	2005-05-25

Many interesting anecdotes from artists such as Mose Allison,Dave Bailey,Bob Brookmeyer,Bill Crow,Herb Geller, Frank Isola,Lee Konitz, Gerry Mulligan, Lennie Niehaus, Hod O'Brien,Phil Urso and Phil Woods.  They speak of their own careers as well as many of the great musicians like Charlie Parker,Sonny Stitt, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell,Chet Baker, Miles Davis,Stan Getz,Stan Kenton,Joe Maini,Gene Quill,Red Rodney, Zoot Sims,Lennie Tristano etc.  Very valuable!	2005-05-22

He ends up greatly maturing as he becomes a newspaper reporter and then owner of the Ford County Times,a small circulation local paper which he builds up and ultimately sells for $1.5 million.

But it turns out that he wasn't. It was a deranged assistant prosecutor. Who shoots Danny Padgitt at a bail hearing after he was arrested as a suspect in the murders of three of the jurors who had voted against the deathy penalty. Plenty of interesting turns and twists in this story.	2005-05-15

One of them, naturally the one who was reluctant to go the party ends up being attacked by drunken brothers and as she tries to save herself she falls out a window and dies.  Believe me these nine pages are gripping. It's straight downhill from there. The author seems totally fixated thruout the rest of the book in totally unbelievable characters. There seem to be racists and bigots absolutely everywhere. This was really a painful read to get thru.	2005-05-02

The suspense and plot were continuous.Just marvelous. The general theme concerned the role of The Church during WWII. A new more liberal Pope has now been elected and he is strongly resisted by an ultra conservative group within The Church called the Crux Vera. The reader is treated to the development of many fine characters,two of the best being Gabriel Allon,art restorer and Mossad agent, and Eric Lange--a hired assassin.

There are lot's of moments where the good guys are fighting the terrorists that seem just startling real. Almost as though the reader was accompanying Oliver North on secret missions. The chief character is Jon Bennett,a Wall street strategist recruited to be a senior advisor to the President. Bennett just seems to me not to be a believable hero. At least not to the degree he is in this book. The plot,while in general, quite exciting seems to bog down with the details of the peace plan. Still, plenty of excitement!!	2005-03-02

Also exposed are some of the greed and dealings between a prominent surgeon, a major teaching hospital and it's municipal hospital affiliate. How can a surgeon be paid to be at two places at the same time?

Dan Mahoney,a former NYPD captain, with 25 years on the force, writes well and authoritatively.  For my personal taste, his main characters are a bit too perfect. <br />The plot of this novel, involving kidnappings by Basque terrorists, did not seem plausible. Mahoney always seems to manage to interject some political bias into the story. To my reading,he painted most of the terrorists rather sympathetically. My preference is just a good page turner without political messages.	2005-02-02
