In his earlier publications, Gombrich famously established that \\"realist\\" representation was as much dependent on the transmission of schematic and/or conventional patterns as those arts identified as \\"decorative\\" or \\"abstract.\\" In \\"The Heritage . . .\\" he maps the history of the representational conventions at work in the most magically compelling of early Renaissance \\"realisms\\"--the rendering of light (direct, reflected and refracted) in Flemish painting. By focusing historical attention on light effects, rather than on linear perspective (initially, a Florentine invention), Gombrich has made it possible to rethink the whole of Renaissance painting's cultural significance, as a creative application of the ancient and medieval science of optics--the systematic study of light and visual perception. The textbook characterization of Renaissance art still privileges the \\"mathematical\\" rigors of perspective-rendering over the \\"intuitive\\" mimicry of light (and its corollary, color), but Gombrich brilliantly demonstrates that they are the two sides of a single coin, each concerned with translating into pictorial formulas the mechanisms of light's transmission and light's reception by the eye.	2005-07-23

It is filled with authentic touches that place the lovers' attempts to find one another in a believable--and dangerously unstable--historical world, but from the very start serendipity plays a central role in bringing these women together, sealing their bond, and setting them on one another's trail once they are flung apart by circumstance.  I thought the ending was wholly in line with the enchanted journey part of the story (tender Pascale and tough Witold both pass into a kind of dream world the moment they meet--and stay there, no matter how ordinary the tasks they must accomplish while searching for one another).  This story has little violence, but much danger, and (contrary to assertions by the reviewer upset that it was not a story about contemporary lesbian role-models for a self-affirming monogamous lifestyle) little sex, but much sensuality.  None of the sex seemed gratuitous or alienated.  I thought it added much sweetness to this deeply romantic grownup fairytale.	2005-04-21

A pattern of coincidences resonating with the principal characters' long-buried pasts, brings them together in the present.  It's Literature with a capital &quot;L,&quot; so the narrative is often oblique, and the adventure is largely an internal one.  New Orleans is as big a protagonist as the two beautiful women who meet there.  I hope to hear more from this captivating writer--it worries me that her earlier publications seem unobtainable.	2004-09-15

I too am biased (I'm a historian of Italian Renaissance art), and while the as yet unknown master who illustrated the Rohan Hours meets none of the usual criteria for &quot;beauty&quot; in 15th-century painting (say, the style of Fra Angelico's angels or Botticelli's maidens--both of these painters produced fine book illustrations), there is no question that he was a brilliantly inventive, keenly expressive artist.  His illustrations for the standard repertoire of Christian Bible stories totally push the envelope of what was usual within a book's pages.  He combined achingly precise realistic description with a total freedom in the scaling and placement of figures, and a luxuriant decorative sense, creating powerful images that virtually burst from the page.  Gestures, facial expressions, accessories from hair to drapery, seem driven by powerful currents generated from the prayers to which they give shape.  A Renaissance original, with a refined, if bold, technique.	2003-12-31

We may get frustrated for them, but I, for one, never found myself regretting Bree's winding journey back home--and it is Bree's story.  I thought Kallmaker did a remarkable job of evoking the strange blend of otherworldliness, vulnerability, toughness, and, yes, intellectual passion in a musical prodigy.  I've been watching classical musicians perform for over 30 years, and Bree's characterization as consumed by her calling absolutely rings true.  Her &quot;immaturity&quot; is ocupational--she's also remarkably sweet, and unwilling to blame others (including those who hurt her without provocation) for her problems.  This book extends Kallmaker's already impressive range.	2003-12-17

This book is a classic! Gracefully written, deeply learned yet unassuming, and deserving the most attentive close reading you can spare. The introduction is the best, most concise treatment available anywhere of the outstanding contributions of Venetian Renaissance painting.  Rosand is possibly the most distinguished scholar now writing about this marvelous topic. Note that the 3 &quot;artist&quot; chapters are not meant to produce a SURVEY of Venetian painting--each has a different THEME that is traced in the art of the master best suited to it. I've been teaching Venetian Renaissance art at the undergrad and grad level for over 20 years, and I can vouch for the excellence of this book.	2003-11-12

Like its predecessor, it stands out for the clear and unassuming prose style with which the first-person narrative draws us into Darcy's wryly self-deprecating, and surprisingly literate point of view.  The cool and accomplished Lindstrom--whose career and safety are put in jeopardy in this story--is a very suitable counterpart to the stubborn and vulnerable Meg. As in the other volumes, the erotic encounters (intense yet handled with a light touch) are skilfully woven into the narrative.  With its rich depiction of the St. Louis locales, compares well with Redmann's angstier Micky Knight series (set in New Orleans) and Kate Allen's kinkier Alison Kaine series (set in Denver).	2003-07-30

This wonderfully illustrated book distills the knowledge gained by the restorers of the National Gallery in London, from decades of well-documented, cutting-edge restorations of the outstanding Italian and northern European Old Master paintings in their care.  It is much, much more than a technical handbook.  Historical essays cover the categories of Renaissance painting, 1300 to 1500, and their many uses, while the second half of the book is an informative catalogue (with gorgeous color reproductions) of individual paintings by many of the best-known Renaissance artists (Botticelli, Jan van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Durer, to name the most obvious).	2003-06-15
US	52832064	R33AQWO5QXB4ML	1883061091	359060574	Emerald City Blues	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	Sweet and gritty	This novel is properly about teen troubles and lesbian love (teenage and adult).  As might be expected from an expert author of speculative fiction (the Isis series), the narrative concerns itself with the sociological dimension of the characters' adventures.  The writing is excellent (Stewart has a real gift for bringing settings to life, and her Seattle is so much more physically immediate than the futureworld of Isis, it feels you're IN it while you read), and for some reason the teenagers in the story get the really hot (and achingly tender) lovemaking scenes.  Isis, with its lesbian warrior society, offers nothing so intense as the erotic writing these kids elicit.  I'm hoping the physicality in ECB will transfer over to and heighten that of the forthcoming Isis stories.	2003-03-14
US	52832064	RQY8CPHEDJ5ZR	0393040283	768988352	Lost Daughters: A Micky Knight Mystery	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	All of the Micky Knight books are fabulous	and it's a crying shame that they are not kept affordably in print--for one thing, it deprives Redmann of some very well earned revenue.  In many ways, this 4th installment of Micky's adventures reads like the natural conclusion to the cycle of investigations opened by the first volume in the series, when we were introduced to a tough and beautiful lesbian babe-magnet with a smart mouth and endless compassion for those in trouble.  She's physical (and even promiscuous--but the series is about how she gets tamed), she's achingly vulnerable, she's noble, she's got demons.  Only in Lost Daughters do we meet her settled into a proper relationship, so the angst quotient is considerably lower than in the other books.  Still, the conclusion to her search for her mother is unbelievably touching, and handled with just the right measure of reserve.  Much as I'd love to see more of her, I wonder whether Redmann (whose website, ominously, appears to have vanished from cyberspace) is finished with her adventures.  If she is, I just pray that she has another heroine in reserve for us to cheer on.  Like the Meg Darcy books, with their lovingly depicted St. Louis locales, the Mickey Knight stories set us in a  believable New Orleans, with its social strata, its weather, its flavors and smells.	2003-03-14

In terms of sheer literary quality, it stands up there with Jean Stewart's lovely Emerald City Blues (though the latter is considerably more explicit, and not so tightly focused on the main protagonists' personal angst).  Anyway, Boock can really write.	2003-03-14

Martin say she's the best, they know whereof they speak.  Gun Shy deserves a second edition with a bit more editorial polish.  The plot is fine, the relationship between the two heroines sweet and complicated, the world they inhabit richly and believably textured.  The use of not-quite-Homeric epithets (the dark-haired woman, the smaller blonde, the smaller woman, etc.) every few sentences (sometimes every other sentence) in place of proper names (Dez, Jaylynn) is unwarranted, and creates a bit of drag in what is otherwise a very fluent and engrossing narrative.  Mind you, I love it that our heroines are present throughout in all their physical specificity, but we don't need to be reminded every 2 minutes that they have blue/hazel eyes, black/blond hair etc.	2003-03-13

Dani is a tough and vulnerable heroine, and her unanticipated rescuers, if a bit too good to be true (but they have to be, to get through Dani's defenses) are so completely defined, with such a wealth of ambient detail, that they're totally irresistible.  The political message is gracefully folded into the people story, and the love-story really grows on you.	2003-03-13
US	52832064	R3XHAS37CQC17	0300072724	628140106	Shadows and Enlightenment	Books	4	15	17	N	Y	not a lunar eclipse	the review by Liddell is barking at the wrong satellite: the book on the shadow that he does recommend IS by an art historian as well--one who has profited from Baxandall's learned engagement with Renaissance art theory.  Baxandall is one of the most important (and self-deprecatingly modest) figures in Renaissance art history, but Shadows and Enlightment is more of an hors d'oeuvre than a full-course banquet (or, to change metaphors, more of a 5-finger exercise than a sonata).  Baxandall has long been concerned with the relationship between perception and representation.  As a historian, he is sensitive to the dramatic changes that our ideas about perception and representation have undergone in the past 6 centuries, and he brings a great skill with ancient and modern languages to the interpretation of texts written by artists and amateurs (which might include philosophers) in the several periods covered by his expertise in art history.  He is not attempting to write \\"bad physics\\" but to shed light on approaches to pictorial representation in an era (the 18th century) when the modern physics of light was about to be developed, and the modern depiction of luminous effects (i.e., Impressionism) was being prepared.  Science and philosophy were far closer in the 18th century than they are today, so Baxandall's brief book concerns itself with ideas about perception as much as it deals with the science of optics, as they related to the practice of painting.  This is art history.  Liddell does not know what s/he's talking about.	2003-03-09

She can evoke a lively alternate world resembling medieval Western Europe, with something like an ethnologist's density of observation.  She favors appealing female heroes, and stages their adventures in a freshly depicted, atmospheric setting, its fauna and flora, villages and farms rendered with admirable economy.  She has an unerring sense in conveying the reality of a scene: small, inconspicuous details from ordinary life, almost peripherally noted, anchor the fantasy proper.  This is \\"speculative\\" fiction--we are invited to reflect on the constraints (particularly when gender-based) under which societies function.  But the rhythms and quiet pleasures of everyday life are never subordinated to the thought-experiment that fuels important aspects of the story.  Read also Fletcher's \\"Lorimal's Chalice\\" (which seems not to have been noticed by Amazon.com!), and check out her website for unpublished stories.  They're all a delight to read.  These are chaste narratives, but the principal characters are women who love women.	2003-02-21

The first-person narrative is vibrant and sexy: P.I. Meg Darcy and her elusive object of desire Sarah Lindstrom stay with us, whetting our appetites for the subsequent 3 volumes in the series (the 2 that are published don't disappoint in their interweaving of mystery and romance).

Prose too purple for the rather sketchily developed plotline (for all the bloodshed and fake-Hispanic hoodoos, Raven's motivation ends up coming across as anticlimactic, since her viewpoint is no more fleshed out than are the sudden shifts of location necessitated by her curse).

Ryan's figures have substance, as does the professional world (well, worlds, since Kaz is a high-level competitive golfer, as well as a powerhouse TV newsroom manager) they inhabit.  The prose is graceful, lean, restrained, and especially sensitive in registering the emotional give-and-take between the sexy (but troubled) heroines.  The tug of attraction between them, and their physical intimacy are very delicately handled, as is the wit with which they address the ironies of their situation.  Ryan's skills are comparable to Melissa Good's but she avoids both cuteness and melodrama in developing her narrative of the heart.	2002-09-29

For those who are familiar with Radclyffe's writing, this is the least &quot;contemporary&quot;-feeling of her novels (not least because the object of the heroine's desire is a preternaturally gifted--and emotionally crippled--old-timey Romantic creative/performing artist whose spiritual complexity is almost inconceivable).  If you can deal with her implausibility (and you should, for the pleasure of sharing her would-be lover's angst), you'll find the book very satisfying.	2002-06-27

Llachlan has fun with the intertextual stuff, while effectively exorcizing the anachronistic Xena/Gabrielle flashbacks that intrude in the Dar/Kerry story.  The love story has a very slow buildup, but the seeds are planted deep right at the outset, so there are lots of emotional facets to the evolving relationship, and each has its own poignancy.

The Way Life Should Be (even the title drags a bit) seems totally resistant to inhabiting its characters' dilemmas, subordinating the romance to a relentlessly detached third-person voice that cannot even wring passion from such a horrific event as the bloody car wreck that destroys an entire family and dominates the final 3rd of the book.  In truth, the novel reads like the expanded outline for a far juicier book yet to be written.  Again, Naiad got lazy.	2002-02-18
