This is a very good book. I was very shocked to read one review that saw linguistics as a Nazi plot to take over the world.   <br />This book is very useful and I found it easy to follow. It is friendly to the layman.  <br /> It gives a lot of comparative linguistic topics and is organized well.  <br /> It never left me in the dirt.

Like the O.J. case, the truth did not matter in Portland; only who had the most money to buy &quot;justice&quot;.<BR>The police are the tools of the ruling class. Watch the TV show Cops; they never go after the rich; even though the rich are stealing from the poor endlessly.<BR> The Portland Trial was not an exception to the rule; it was the rule. ALL court verdicts in America are determined by money. U.S. prisons are full of people whose only crime was they couldn't afford a decent defense. When was the last time a rich person got excuted? I can't think of one. Death Row is a poor folks' club.<BR> A Hundred Little Hitlers is about three things: a black man dying in a fight, the race movement in America, and most importanly, what a joke the U.S. Courts are.<BR> This is an important book for anyone who has never been screwed over by American courts (namely,the upper classes) to read. If you have been screwed by the courts (the lower classes), you'll enjoy it because it's good to read the truth for a change.	2003-10-06

He was never a Thulist nor neo-Odinist as the book claims. He is an atheist. He's not a Rune master; he doesn't know a feu from an odal rune. <BR> WAR has never been an Odinist organization. WAR promotes that race is your religion. Odinism is the worship of Odin.<BR> Don't waste your money on this... book!<BR>A real crackpot thing this book gets into is the author claims to have gone to a secret Nazi Occult colony in the jungles of South America. And he implies he saw Martin Borman in the jungles of South America. Only a nut would believe anything this kook writes. Martin Borman was killed by a Russian in April 1945. Hitler is not alive in Chile. There are no secret Nazi camps in South America. The author of this book is insane. This is like something you would read in the Globe or the Star.
