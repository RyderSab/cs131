Woven within the tales of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young are more recent murders influenced by the radical beliefs of extreme fundamentalist Mormons.  Author Jon Krakauer effectively blends history with current events with an interesting narration that implies radical religious fundamentalism is not exclusively in the Middle East.<br />Krakauer's book focuses on Dan and Ron Lafferty, who slashed the throats of their sister-in-law and infant niece in 1984.  The Lafferty's were allegedly motivated by a revelation received by Ron from the Lord.  However, the brothers were angry with their victim for non-secular reasons well before the revelation.   Krakauer is effective on this crime and throughout the Mormon history at laying out the facts, but allowing the reader to draw conclusions on motives.<br />The Mormon history is exciting, shocking and surprising.  Its founders regularly announced revelations on many social and spiritual issues.  Martyred founder, Joseph Smith, a notorious womanizer, received spiritual inspiration to declare polygamy as divine right.  Again, the author challenges the reader to judge Smith's intentions. <br />&quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot; is very relevant in a world of suicide bombings and other religiously inspired terrorism.  While Americans worry about Bin Laden, Krakauer inspires us to also look over our shoulder.  Great Read!  Enjoy.	2003-08-20

It has the same pace as TV's \\"24\\" - a sleuth needs to solve an impossible puzzle in 24 hours.<br />A museum curator is murdered, but in death leaves clues to a century-old secret.  A Harvard expert on religious symbolism and a French detective chase the clues through murder and mayhem.  Around each bend we meet multi-dimensional characters - a few on the border of genius and madness.<br />The plot is creative, yet unpredictable.  In addition to enjoyment, the reader gets and education in religious history and symbolism - although quite a bit comes from the author's rich imagination. The language is realistic.  The speed is spell-binding.  It is a great read and I am exploring Brown's last novel.  Enjoy!	2003-06-18

Higgins takes the reader on various detours - like the woes of a former Senator and war hero, and the struggles of an aging hero scouring a deadly desert.  While these detours fill pages and bring back some of Higgins's past protagonists, their purposes are unclear and they do not add to the plot.<br />Dillon continues to gain more depth as a character with each book. His relationship with Hannah Bernstein, which was heating up with each novel - grows cold in this one.  This leaves Dillon with deep thoughts, but no purpose.<br />No doubt - 'Midnight Runner' is a decent read.  There are just too many sub-plots and too many pages as empty as the deserts Higgins describes.	2003-05-19

While violence continues on the battlefield, warfare is engaged in Washington, London and Moscow between the passionate and the pragmatic on how to deal with Hitlers Germany.<br />Leading the passionate group that intends to punish Germany, and destroy its industrial capability to wage war, is Henry Morgenthau, Jr., U.S. Treasury Secretary, Franklin Roosevelts best friend and the only Jewish member of Roosevelts cabinet.   Morgenthau learns about the Holocaust and he transforms from bean counter to zealot in trying to stop the slaughter and punish the Germans.<br />Henry Stimson, Roosevelts Secretary of War, leads the pragmatic group.  While Stimson is leading the carnage inflicted on the German army, he fears the impact on all of Europe if Deutschland cannot feed or care for itself.  Stimson wants a balance of punishment and rebuilding Germany as a democracy.<br />The antagonists push their proposals with Roosevelt and later Harry Truman.  Neither comes across as flawless in their judgment as some historians remember.  Yet both demonstrate solid judgment and wisdom to choose a path that rebuilds what is todays Europe.<br />Churchill and Stalin play key roles in Beschlosss saga as they vie for pieces of Germany.  The tug of war among the three victors leads to the Berlin Wall, but The Conquerors suggests the fifty years of Cold War may have strengthened Western Europe and driven passive growth in Western Germany more than other alternatives being debated.<br />The book possesses an irregular pace.  The historian side of Beschloss did his homework, sighting diary entries and other documents that sometimes churn the story into a crawl.  The meetings, debates and eventual decisions accelerate the second half of the book toward an intriguing and satisfying conclusion.  <br />To the victors go the spoils.  Thank God, the debates among the victors blended into a peaceful conclusion for the world.	2003-04-18

Unless he relays this discovery to England, huge RAF loses will continue and British and Russian war efforts may crumble.  With the help of his heroic brother, a new love and a British agent, Harald needs to dodge some determined pursuers and navigate a 600-mile trek across the cold North Sea to gain his freedom and to help the war effort.  Ken Follett delivers a realistic and engaging tale in \\"Hornet Flight\\".<br />Follett is no stranger to World War II yarns, but he approaches this thriller with a new and refreshing perspective.  Rather than painting the Germans as rabid Nazis, he portrays them only as menacing background.  The real villain is a Danish detective with a very complex personality, determined to break the spy ring and extract personal vengeance from Harald and his family.  The hero is imperfect, yielding a clever idea one moment and staggering into a pitfall the next.   This heightens the realism and suspense.  In fact, Follett downplays his normal gunplay, using the space to develop a very rich ensemble of characters woven into an intriguing and rewarding story.<br />\\"Hornet Flight\\" neither begins nor ends with explosions.  The reader ends up enjoying the journey as much as the destination.	2003-01-04

Six months later, while trying to sort out her shattered life, she spots her rapist near the university.  Her relentless pursuit leads to his arrest and eventually a trial.  Will retribution lead to salvation or does it just open the doorway to a darker journey?  Author Alice Sebold provides passion and insight to this tragic story.  \\"Lucky\\" is her autobiography.<br />Sebold pulls no punches in sharing her story.  The violence rips you.  The language cuts.  Her revenge sears at your soul.  Alice's despair leaves you hollow.  The author is courageous in admitting all of the peculiarities about her family and acknowledging her own flaws.  In doing so, she weaves an edgy story about physical and psychological terror, giving this reader a new perspective of rape and its punishing aftermath.  By listening to the audio version, read by the author, you appreciate how two decades have only dusted a still very raw nerve.<br />This is no fairy tale with a Cinderella ending.  However, Seybold shares a triumphant realization in the end.  \\" . . . I live in a world where the two truths coexist, where both hell and hope lie in the palm of my hand.\\"	2003-01-04

As Linda pulls up empty traps, the reader feels there is also something missing in the text.<br />The book does a nice job depicting life on a Maine island, where the author excels at painting the natural and physical features of the isle.  You sniff the saltwater, pines and barnacles.  Some of the island characters are wonderful in their stoic nature with an occasional streak of zaniness.  Linda gives us a very textbook lesson in lobstering.  We learn about these delicious giant insects, how they are captured and how they are replenished.<br />What Ms. Greenlaw does not provide is an honest depiction of herself.  Why would an enormously successful sword fishing captain and best-selling author, settle on a tiny island?  Why is her bank account so tight, when we know her earnings on the first book were very good?  Perhaps she lost all the money.  Tell us about it?  Maybe a love or tragedy sent her home?  We want to know?  <br />'The Lobster Chronicles' is a good travel log.  Like the missing lobsters, the book is empty when it comes honest self perspective.	2002-11-28

Prodded by his uncle, Rudy confronted and beat a bigger boy.  From that day forward Giuliani never backed down, whether was John Gotti or Arafat.<br />'Leadership' is a fascinating book where Giuliani tells his amazing life story while applying his experiences to some solid leadership principles - the foundation being, &quot;Don't Back Down.&quot; Rather than boring readers in a serial description of his life from birth until now, Rudy blends key events, like 9-11, into an interesting mix tied to a logical sequence of leadership principles.  <br />No book can describe the amazing accomplishments by the former mayor in lowering crime and rebuilding NYC.  No biography can depict the emotional and vital leadership Rudy provided in the tragic days after 9-11.  Giuliani's attempt may be too pragmatic to capture all of his values, but he tries.  This reader's only disappointment is Rudy's determination to defend past indiscretions in this book.  We are beyond those moments in our respect for the mayor.  Both the glow and cracks make-up his character.<br />Over all, it's a book worth reading.  We hope Rudy will attempt another biography in the future, where a longer and broader perspective may enrich his story.	2002-11-28

Matt, a poet and house painter, and Katie, his editor, are destined for marriage until Matt abruptly walks out.  In his retreat, Matt leaves a diary.  A ghost from his past, Suzanne, wrote a diary for her infant son, Nicholas.  Katie must escape her anguish, read the diary and understand its relevance to her lost lover.<br />In a radical change in direction, author James Patterson leaves behind his best selling murder and mayhem mysteries to create a sweet romantic tale, \\"Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas.\\"  For sure, the basics of the novel are sound.  The plot is interesting.  There is plenty of intrigue.  The story makes an excellent statement about life's priorities.  There are enough twists and turns to pull us to a satisfactory ending.<br />The disappointment comes from the main protagonist, Suzanne.   Her voice, as written in the diary, is over-the-top when it comes to exaggerated enthusiasm, multiple adjectives and other thoughts that border on goofiness.  Granted, this doctor and mother recovered from a near fatal illness.  With new priorities, she is delighted with life.  However, Suzanne is unable to regulate her joy so the readers feel like they're ingesting the sugar through a fire hose.  Also, you are also forced to imagine little Nicholas growing up to read about Mom's most intimate moments, written to him in the diary.   <br />\\"Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas\\" is a good story with concepts that may help us all.  I suggest readers pace themselves by putting the book aside often when the sugar count gets too high.  It may prevent some cavities.	2002-10-15

Will they stop the Pope's assassination?   How will Jack Ryan play into all of this?  <br />\\"Red Rabbit\\" is a good concept, blending fiction with actual history.  Knowing that the actual attempt on Pope John Paul failed does not detract from the suspense.  Clancy found the post-Soviet does not provide the same intrigue and danger as the Cold War.   The true gem of this thriller is getting inside the Rabbit's head.  His perspective about assassination, defection and the conflicting loyalty to the Soviet Republic is complex and engrossing.<br />The plot is slow.  The reader hangs with it as the drama crawls forward, but a few more surprises and twist would have amplified the satisfaction.  Perhaps Clancy is not comfortable with a novel that lacks the superb technology of others.  Without the bells and whistles he has to create a faster pace and greater thrills.  In this race between an interesting rabbit and a tortoise-like pace, we only have a tie.	2002-09-19

A pretty basic job transforms into a season in hell in &quot;The Nanny Diaries&quot; by Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus.<br />The primary conflict is between Mrs. X and Nan.  The head of the household is an interesting and very complex character that evokes a range of emotion from sympathy to rage.  She fights hard to save her marriage and to find some self-esteem beyond the clothes and jewels.  Nan and Mrs. X's direct and indirect battles add tension to the tale.<br />Their son, Greyer, is also fascinating.  While completely spoiled by his parent's riches, he greatly suffers from their neglect.  Greyer clings to Nan.  This only adds to his mother's anxieties.  The reader roots for the boy and we are left wondering about his future.  Did he grow from his positive nanny experience or does he grow cold, like his parents?<br />Nan is a bit of a disappointment.  Initially, she is thrilled to be in the elite environment - eagerly observing the brands on the labels.  She evolves into a masochist -- accepting the unreasonable tasks and poor treatment despite her parent's warnings. There is no logic for her to accept the demands of Mrs. X.  Nan's family appears to be in the upper class.  She is close to a PhD and appears to have a positive future. Unfortunately, she only begins pushing back because of a small Christmas gift from Mrs. X and some pay issues.  This reader hoped the poor treatment to she and Greyer would have pushed her to fight back. <br />Despite that disappointment, this book is a though-provoker.  Serfdom survives.  The very rich are very sad people.  The reader tries to imagine the future of each main character.  Mary Poppins - not really.  Nan is more like Burt -- looking down the chimney.	2002-08-29

He must demonstrate his ancestry with Czar Nicholas.  He also must distract the United States with a major underwater disaster.  Only one man - Kurt Austin and his NUMA team can stop them.  Clive Cussler -- best-selling author of the Dirk Pitt - NUMA series, and Paul Kemprecos -- oceanographer and past Cussler contributor, developed a hot tale with only a few cold spots.  <br />'Fire Ice' is a great mix of history, technology and adventure.  Kurt Austin is an ingenious hero with a courageous and cocky swagger.  He is surrounded by well-rounded characters, like Vladimir Petrov -- a former KGM foe turned ally of Austin.  The villains for the most part are pretty diabolical with enough evil to drive the plot.  Kemprecos' contributions are evident with enough technology to sale an outrageous story line into credible waters.<br />One particular battle scene between \\"Old Ironsides' versus machine gun toting villains in Boston Harbor illustrates the skill Cussler and Kemprecos deliver in weaving a far fetched idea into a semi-plausible sub-plot.  This does not work throughout the book.  The key villains, so skilled at the outset, transform from smart Cossacks to Keystone Cops toward the end.  A more balanced battle would have heightened the overall satisfaction.<br />Regardless of a few holes in the hull, 'Fire Ice' is a hearty tale that is worth a look.  Enjoy!	2002-08-19

The poignancy and humor are a delightful mix.<br />The first chapter sets the stage as Sedaris describes his speech therapy in a Carolina grade school.  The school is trying to correct his lisp.  In reality they are concerned about his potential homosexuality.  Sedaris has fun describing the scene.  Beneath the surface you feel his anguish.<br />The rest of the book is a colorful blur of stories about his family, early jobs and other facets of his life.  Two highlighted phases is an early addiction to speed and a later residency in Paris.  In each incident Sedaris is a clown when it comes to self-depreciation, but his smiles lightly cloaks some more serious themes.<br />I recommend &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; because of the diverse perspective it delivers.  At minimum you will be entertained.  At the same time David Sedaris introduces real social and cultural issues without sermonizing.	2002-08-16

Some of their lives unravel.  Some build strength from their sorrow.  All eventually find acceptance -- including Susie.<br />Author Alice Sebold is a beautiful writer.  Susie finds that heaven is individually designed.  Sebold demonstrates a creative gift that easily rivals J. K. Rowling in describing Susie's imaginative heavenly wishes. The dilemna for the young girl is the limits of a 14 year old imagination.  She must explore and observe the earth to broaden her heaven.  The story underlines the beauty of the search over the destination.<br />'Lovely Bones' projects many levels -- a mystery/thriller, a romance, and a moving story about courageous relationships.  The characters are clear and memorable.<br />In a year of excellent books 'Lovely Bones' stands out.  Many are calling it a classic.  Perhaps, but for me it is a personal treasure -- a peace of heaven in the literary clouds.	2002-08-16

What is most interesting is the perspectives of their families and their colleagues from the firehouse that were not on call that terrible day.  The reader gets a sense of the extreme emotions of pride, anger, sorrow, guilt and loss by those remaining in this terrible void.<br />David Halberstam is a gifted reporter and writer who uses simple prose to effectively describe a complex and horrible situation.  Hundreds of fireman were among the thousands lost at the WTC.  By personalizing this small team, Halberstram enables us to better appreciate all of the heroes and victims of the attack.

Jack and friends pursue a more creative means of gaining vengeance.<br />James Patterson & Peter De Jonge have spun a very creative yarn. There are several surprises and some fun twists and turns.  The book breaks the speed limits with Patterson's traditional 100+ chapters.<br />Two key characters blunt total satisfaction with this tale.  The victim is a true bum - a dropout with a number of unethical characteristics.  His only redeeming value is the love of his brother.  Jack - both the protagonist and narrator - has a whiney and self-serving voice.  It actually becomes irritating as the action plot intensifies.  It is challenging the reader to mourn the victim or root for the heroic brother, the plot is only enjoyable at a very high level - class warfare between the rich and poor.<br />Yes, \\"The Beach House\\" is a good summer read as you bake at the pool or seashore.

The primary focus is on Kincaid as the complexity of his background and character is explored.  As he contemplates the end of his life, Kincaid is anxious about his past, concerned about leaving this earth with a broken heart and no legacy.  The reader will be surprised with what he discovers.  Fransesca has a minor role.  Her affair with Kincaid strengthened her.  While she lives with its memories, she never regrets their brief relationship.<br />Robert James Waller is a gifted writer with poetic prose and a creative use of settings.  His weakness is how he designed the story - more like an engineer than an artist.  To add drama and suspense he engineers a number of coincidences and close encounters between Kincaid and some key characters throughout the story.  Unfortunately, it isn't natural or realistic.  The reader often loses one's suspension of disbelief.  Otherwise, Waller delivers a fine story about aging and dealing with a haunted past.<br />As one of the zillions that read &quot;Bridges&quot;, I am curious if &quot;A Thousand Country Roads&quot; will appeal to someone that is clueless about the Roseman Bridge.  Probably a mute point - only a fraction of us zillions need to try it for Mr. Waller pave quite a few roads with gold.	2002-06-10

No doubt - the man was a genius and it is clear he delivered some outstanding changes in civil rights and social goodness.  At the same time he was a horrible tyrant - very capable of crushing anyone's self esteem.  Robert Caro mixes the good with the bad in describing LBJ's Senate years in the outstanding biography, &quot;Master of the Senate.&quot;<br />Lyndon Johnson was master communicator.  He shamelessly kissed up to key mentors while terrorizing some collegues and staff.  His main gift was a systemic vision of how to amplify his power throughout the Senate.  In doing so he rapidly changed our society.  Caro is very effective at describing LBJ without judgement, like a fly on this historic wall.  The author forces us to make our own judgements, utilizing records and colorful antecedents.  The entire story is informative and enjoyable.  My only concern was the lengthy history of Senator Richard Russell that seemed to go on and on.  Perhaps a fifth of the 1,100 pages<BR>are not essential to the story.<br />That is why I really enjoyed the audio version of the book.  It is abridges, but thorough.

Gabriel Allon returns as a talented art restorer and crack agent from Isreal.  A European cat and mouse game ensues with much of the action in the peaks and valleys of the Swiss Alps.<br />Daniel Silva's fourth novel is a vivid travelog of the Swiss culture and countryside.  If only a fraction of the plot's focus on Swiss complicity to Nazi attrocities is true, the 'neutral' Swiss facade will collapse.  Silva tries to give his two deadly characters some guilt and angst.  They suffer through several killings, but the reader eventually finds it hard to root for either of these manics. Perhaps we prefer cool and cold killers.  Or maybe the author is too determined to preach to us on the 'real' Swiss crimes, when all we wanted was a thrilling yarn. It's a decent beach book, but - next time - we expect a little more from the Mr. Silva.	2002-05-07

While stern and distant to his sons, Judge Atlee is a local legend for his judicial prowess and benevolence.   He is also dead upon their arrival.  Ray discovers a $3M stash, not far from the judge's corpse.  He proceeds to hide it from his pathetic brother, the estate and a mysterious blackmailer as he searches for the source of the judge's secret fortune.<br />While many of the main characters are associated with the law, Grisham continues his trek away from legal thrillers.  Ray is simultaneously trying to discover his father's secrets while dealing with the growing guilt around his deceit.  The book excels on Ray angst in seeking new hiding place for the cash.  It is disappointing in Ray's inability to reconcile with his father's real greatness as the old man's true values become clearer.<br />Despite this setback, I recommend \\"The Summons\\" and encourage the author to continue pursuing new literary paths.  Grisham's pace, prose and story depth is improving with each new work.	2002-04-20

An Army captain allegedly murdered a U.S. Lieutenant in Hue, Viet Nam in 1968.  Brenner is sent to find the witness.  Susan, an alleged American businessperson in Viet Nam, befriends him.  He seeks to discover her real identity.  Finally, this is Paul's third tour of Nam.  His main search is to unravel the horrific nightmares that continue to haunt him.<br />\\"Up County\\" is a delightful journey.  First, Paul Brenner's first person narration is addicting with his constantly wisecracking outer voice and his more thoughtful inner voice.  The novel is a travel log of today's Viet Nam with interesting details about the culture, geography, food and mood.  Like Paul, much of the country remains haunted by the war.  The victorious Northern veterans continually try to rationalize their role while the vanquished southern citizenry resent their occupation.  Like locusts, Americans and French businesses swarm into Nam, reversing defeat by buying recovering commerce.<br />The main story is Paul reliving his nightmares and better understanding the war's sorrow and savagery.  Will he find his peace?  That question becomes more intriguing then the murder mystery.  \\"Up Country\\" is a vivid and fascinating journey that yields as much joy as the destination.	2002-04-20

Maude Coleman befriends Lavinia Waterhouse and, together, they grow from children to womanhood during a tumultuous era of technology and social change.  Two protaginists, Maude's mother - Kitty and Simon - a young grave digger, are critical in propeling the plot from melodrama to a thought-provoking story about relationships - both here and in the here-after.<br />Chevalier is gifted in developing distinct and often realistic voices for each character.  She strikes gold in the voices of Lavinia, Maude's grandmother, and Kitty.  She strikes-out with the voices of Simon -- too mature &amp; worldly, and Mr. Waterhouse -- too reserved for a man going through such pain and anxiety.<br />Those flaws aside, the author blends the history, the colors and the sybolism into a satisfying recipe that lingers with the reader in a satisfying manner.	2002-03-05

Murder!  Despite four clear suspects, a Scotland Yard investigation, a highly publicized Coroner's inquest and 125 years of professional and amateur sleuthing, the murderer is not identified . . . until now!<br />James Ruddick solves an infamous riddle in \\"Death At The Priory\\". His book is divided into three intriguing parts.  The events leading up to the murder and the inital inquest provides all the suspense and mystery of an Agatha Christie yarn.  Ruddick skillfully weaves Coroner's inquest testimony into facinating dialog, adding color and spice to a brisk narration.<br />The second part enables the author to narrow the suspects and eventually identify the murderer by utilizing the wealth of research on the murder and a very creative perspective.  The third part takes the reader through some of the dark secrets of Victorian wealth.  In a society of double standards, even a wealthy woman becomes a prisoner within her own household.  What can she do to stop being beaten, sodomized, robbed, verbally abused and nearly killed by an abusive husband? There are no help groups or laws to protect her.  <br />In the end most of the charaters involved in \\"Death At The Priory\\" are poisoned by the notoriety.  For the reader there is a great deal of satisfaction from this work and a greater appreciation that today's standards, no matter how flawed, are far more preferable than the good old days of Queen Victoria.  Enjoy!	2002-02-06

During her tumultuous experience in his household, Griet becomes the subject of his most famous portrait, &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring.&quot;<br />Author Tracy Chevalier is also a Master, painting the emotions of Griet with soft sensuous strokes mixed with bold brushes of self-discovery.  Chevalier develops vivid characters, especially the artist's wife and mother-in-law.  Vermeer, is a quiet genius, but the short spurts of his voice and the movement of his eyes provide the canvas for Griet's emotions. <br />This novel is moderate in length, but I gladly would have enjoyed twice as many pages.  Chevalier leaves us staring at the painting, wondering -- as she did -- what further adventures awaited the &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot;.	2002-02-02

Alex Cross, ace detective and  psychologist, must track down modern-day vampires while simaltaneously battling a serial killer called, 'Mastermind'. The concept is creepy.  The mood is intense.  The action flies by in short spurts of about three pages per chapter.<br />The highlight is the first person perspective of Alex Cross.  You sense his frustration, fear, competitiveness, anger and guilt.  James Patterson wove a very complex and rich character.<br />There is some disappointment.  The vampire murders actually become monotonous.  Sure, Patterson finds some creative methods of dealing with each victim, but the reader loses the intitial terror and dread as the bodies pile up.  Also, 'Mastermind' is too similar to Gary Sonji, a serial killer from 'Along Came A Spider' who re-appeared in a later book.  The deja vu is a lapse in creativity.  We don't that kind of hook to buy the next book.<br />With those two exceptions -- \\"Violets Are Blue\\" is a good thriller.  Enjoy!	2002-01-29

The author captures the settings around Teddy with masterful descriptions about the weather, surroundings, sounds and smells of the scene.  He blends the quotes with the prose in a mix that yields an intense and enjoyable story.  Morris avoids the risks of heroe worship by chronicling some Roosevelt mis-steps, like his poor handling of a Brownsville racial incident and some of his ill-tempered public debates.  But by focusing only on the White House years, &quot;Theodore Rex' captures a rare focus on an extraordinary leader who's accomplishments continue to benefit us. <br />Some readers may avoid this book, given the criticism directed at the author's biography of Ronald Reagan.  Don't - this is an excellent biography in the same spirit of David McCullough's &quot;John Adams.&quot;  Enjoy!	2002-01-14

Her advesary in a relentless game of can &amp; mouse is Major Dieter Franck, a clever and cruel army detective.  Over a 10 day period the reader ducks, winces and twitches through intense suspense.  <br />Major Franck is a gem - a sadistic interrogator with an occasional conscience. His chapters are so intriguing, they tip the balance of reader interest early in the book.  However, when the Jackdaw team reaches France, Flick draws even with the major and novel accellerates.<br />Like all great roller coasters, you don't want it to end.

A war correspondent investigates a murder in post-war Berlin.  In the process he rediscovers his true love while sinking deeper into the first battles of the Cold War.  Author Kanon does a superb job on the setting where you see, feel and smell the devastation of this bombed-out city.  He achieves realistic complexity in his characters - war survivors attempting to rationalize their role while trying to build a new life.  This novel's only challenge is that the intial snale's pace cloaks the later excitement and intrigue. I listened to the audio version and thoroughly enjoyed Stanley Tucci's wonderful accents. Therefore, I recommend &quot;The Good German&quot; -- especially the audio tape.  It's good drama mixed with some interesting history.  Enjoy!	2001-11-27

The protaginist - Sean Dillon, must track down a dangerous Middle Eastern billionaire before he can reek havoc on the world.  While prior to 11 September, this book is relevant to our crisis.  Higgins does a nice job bringing out more dimensions of Dillon and some of the other good guys.  The author bumbles a chance to knock off a key character - losing the opportunity to add some tension and passion to the survivors.  Incredibly, this person takes three bullets and lives.  The plot is solid and fast paced.  My only problem is with the enemies.  They are too cold and their motives are weak.  The key assaisin could audition for the Key Stone Cops.  Don't get me wrong, the Edge of Danger is a good yarn.  I hope Higgins continues to improve the depth and reality of his characters.  I look forward to the next edition.	2001-11-01

It delivers quality perspectives on how to empower individuals and entire workforces.  The layout is in logical chapters or sections, like &quot;Do Something Different Now&quot; and &quot;Realize Your Potential&quot;.  Contained in each chapter are simple concepts on how to demonstrate more initiative with examples of how individuals succeeded by being more proactive.  The results are credible and interesting stories in support of a of one objective, otherwise known as the 'Ultimate Expectation', &quot;Always Do What Needs To Be Done Without Waiting To Be Asked.&quot;  True, some of the concepts are pure commons sense.

In recent years Cussler's characters were too flat and the plots were too outlandish for enjoyment. Valhalla Rising proved to be a wonderful page-turner and a delightful romp.  The author concentrated on the heroe's character by drawing on inner thoughts and more charismatic dialog.  Cussler developed two facinating sub-plots that keep the reader's interest long beyond Pitt's inevitable victory over the evil guys.  Readers enjoy an unexpected surprise at the ending.

Well-designed because in focuses on key moments of the post-revolution days rather than attempting to cover all aspects of the early years of our democracy.  Too many historic journals dilute the information by spreading themselves too thin.  Joseph Ellis selects interesting events with long-reaching impacts on the U.S. and then applies tremendous content and balance to them.  Several characters, like James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, provides links among chapters.  It reminds us that a small team created this country.

King is the narrator. Some authors are wise to delegate that role to an actor, but King relishes the role. He brings out the humor, color, characters and settings in a joyful demonstration of his craft in front of a live audience.<br />I won't spoil the ending -- only to say it makes you churn around the possibilities for a lot longer than an hour.

Why do we need a fictional depiction of the events leading up to the Declaration of Independence with so many excellent non-fictional records in distribution?  My concerns were unfounded.  &quot;Rise to Rebellion&quot; offers a different and enjoyable perspective of our history.<br />Jeff Shaara focuses on five catalysts - Ben Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Gage and Abigail &amp; John Adams.  Franklin underestimates the concerns of the colonists, but evolves into one of the revolution's most inspired leaders.  Washington is uncomfortable about his new command, but he transforms nervous energy into dynamic leadership.  Gage is the unfortunate first general to face the minutemen.  His initial arrogance crumbles into desparation at the bottom of Bunker Hill.  Finally, John and Abigail Adams give a glimpse of the risks, lonliness and uncertainty faced by revolutionary couples of their day.<br />Non-fictional chronicles accurately describe events and transcribe the words of our first leaders.  Jeff Shaara imagines their thoughts and misgivings without altering the events.  This adds more dimensions to each character by making them human.  When we understand their frailties and anxieties, we better understand their courage.<br />Especially for those that enjoyed &quot;John Adams&quot;, I recommend this book.	2001-08-12

Rushmore, David McCullough built a greater monument for this statesman through this fine book.	2001-07-04

If this case was not challenging enough, his personal life struggles with health problems and other serious issues within his family.  Roses Are Red gets inside the head of this super sleuth.  He becomes very human in dealing with the stress and fears of all that is swirling around him.<br />Author James Patterson delivers a fast-moving story that grabs the reader on the first page and pull us until the bitter, bloody end.  As usual, Patterson gives us a variety of points of view by changing the narrator.  Sometimes it's Cross and sometimes it's the killer.  He accomplishes this with a new chapter every three pages.  That is fast and often a waste of paper.  It's not a problem.  Roses are Red delivers a satisfying thriller.	2001-06-29

Their authors attempt to apply historical situations to modern day business, but the comparisons often lack relevance. Not true with 'Elizabeth I, CEO: Strategic Lessons from the Leader Who Built an Empire' by Alan Axelrod. The author provides interesting lesson's from one of Great Britain's most famous monarchs that can readily be applied to today's business solutions. The manner in which Queen Elizabeth I deals with restructuring, developing leadership and fighting the competition that are benchmarks for modern leaders. No, we all don't have Armada's to battle, but even more minor skirmishes will be easier to deal with after reading this book.	2001-06-14

One survivor of a Mexican expedition claims her team was murdered by mysterious assasins.  The National Underwater &amp; Marine Agency, (NUMA), goes on the hunt to stop these murderers and to understand their motives.  Their quest takes them inside Mayan ruins and to the depths of the sunken Andrea Doria.<br />Serpent is very good in portraying a historical mystery involving Christopher Columbus.  It is superb in taking the reader through the perils of a Mexican jungle.  The overall plot is too far fetch, removing the readers from their suspension of disbelief.  The pace is inconsistent with large pockets of boredom between good portions of suspension.  <br />Serpent is a decent beach book.  The author is attempting to develop a parallel series to Dirk Pitt, a best selling favorite.  This is a weak start.  Give us Dirk!	2001-06-08

A gifted writer and poet, she enters and wins fabulous prizes in advertising slogan contests, popular in the '50's and '60's.  Those prizes arrive in the 'nick of time' as appliances break and bankers are about to foreclose.<br />The story goes beyond new cars, appliances and cash.  Evelyn is trapped in the housewife stereotype of that era with no option to divorce a true jerk or explore career options beyond her ironing board.  She must use her wits and a positive spirit to carry her babies to new heights.<br />Defiance, Ohio was founded by General Mad Anthony Wayne, who 'defied  . . . the British and all the devils in hell' to take his fort.

The survivors of the Bataan Death March endure three years of agony only to face execution as Allied forces close in on Japanese positions in the Phillipines.  A Ranger Company is sent behind enemy lines in an attempt to free hundreds of prisoners.  'Ghost Soldiers' explains all sides of the conflict.  It grimly describes the prisoners' suffering.

Pablo Escabar grows from a local bandit to the feared leader of Columbia's Medellin Drug Cartel.  Despite a calm personality, he is a ruthless killer, responsible for hundreds of murders.  When Paplo aspires for public office, the Columbian Government, backed by U.S. agents, decide to stop him.  Civil war breaks out in the country and the stakes increase.   As the situation deteriorates, the hunters take on many of Pablo's worst characteristics.  Capturing Pablo won't be enough.  The goal is to kill him.<br />Mark Bowden, author of 'Black Hawk Down', is a gifted researcher and storyteller.  The enjoyment and intensity glows during the hunt, but cools as the author at times piles on too much background and statistics.  Overall, 'Killing Pablo' is a great tale, demonstrating, again, the power of well-written non-fiction.	2001-05-29

At about 3 pages per chapter all of the speed-reading 'wannabes' will brag how they knocked off ten chapters in just an hour.  Fast - yes, but don't judge this book by its chapters.  'First To Die' is entertaining and intense.<br />A group of professional women form a pact to help capture a serial killer.  The narrative is by Lindsay Boxer, a police inspector,  who juggles the quest for the killer with a number of other personal crisises.  Patterson uses first person narratives to flush out the main character.  He also changes point-of-view at times to get us inside the killer's head.  The many chapters are one tool to switch point-of-views without confusing the readers.  If there is a minor flaw with this approach, it is some flatness with other characters where we don't get inside their heads.<br />I enjoy Patterson's Alex Cross series, but I am happy he is launching a completely different heroine + buddies to track similar demented killers.  'First To Die' is a good first attempt at this new series.  I look forward to the next.	2001-04-07

Ann Rice accomplishes those basics in 'Vittorio the Vampire'.  She take us one step further with a lesson in choice.  <br />Rice first establishes a fantastic setting in Florence's 15th century Golden Age.  Her prose amplifies the opulence and turbulence of the era.  Both play a key role in Vittorio's transition.  She builds suspense to his tragedy, his vengence and his seduction - leaving the reader thirsting for each page.<br />Her main theme is one of choice.  Vittorio begins as a victim, but ultimately makes his own tragic decisions.  He is monitored by heaven and hell, but, like we readers, the angels and devils can only anticipate his path.  In the end he is cursed to fully appreciate what he gained and lost each and every day.<br />You may only enjoy the horror themes of this excellent yarn.  Deeper, Rice reminds us that their can be horror in our daily decisions.	2001-04-01

What's the rush?  Grisham follow's Pappy's pace in the first part of the book, finds the accellerator in the middle, and coasts home at the end.  At times the reader is charmed by the sly and ironic narrative of Luke Chandler, a seven year old future St. Louis Cardinal.  At times the reader is hooked into nail-biting intensity as two rival villains develop.  The rest of the journey is about as exciting as watching paint dry.  <br />Overall, I recommend this book.  We must encourage Grisham to get out of the court room.  He demonstrates a skill beyond mere litigators.  This is especially true with the narrator's sweetness,  reminding me of moments from &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird.&quot;  The big difference between this novel and the Atticus Finch classic is the ending, Grisham's Achilles heal.  While there is some satisfaction, at least four major characters and one disaster are too easily set aside or left hanging.  True, we can all imagine their fates.  But the page count is light enough that a couple knots could have been tied.  That would bring this effort 'Cliff Notes' status.  Keep experimenting, Mr. Grisham.  Both 'The Testament' and &quot;A Painted House' show a great deal of promise.	2001-03-23

The villains are evil, the locations are exotic and the heroes are gallant.  Unfortunately, all of these assets are thin and flat.  The villains are dunces, unable to appreciate or even emotionally react to threats and disasters.  The heroes are cool, almost  bored.  While revenge for a brutal murder is at stake, no real danger threaten them.  It's a sleepwalk to the final page.<br />Please understand, I am a big Higgins fan that found the Dillon/Blake partnership to be entertaining in The President's Daughter and The Whitehouse Connection.  As a paperback, Day of Recknoning offers some value.  I trust Jack Higgins can boost the emotion around a successful formula in future yarns.	2001-03-04

While most of us have seen the famous photo of the Transcontinental Railroad being joined with a gold spike, I did not understand the true grit, risk, ingenuity and challenges of the task.  Stephen Ambrose brings this out in an entertaining and personal way.  The entertainment comes from his 'dueling banjos' style of one chapter on the Eastern railway and one chapter on the Western competitor.  Ambrose gets into personalities from the giants to those who dug the tunnels and pounded the spikes.  He paraphrases some of the quotes, saving us from that era's stilted and preachy dialog.  Finally, he puts the task into today's perspective.  There is nothing like this in the world.  It remains to be seen whether space travel will match the Transcontinental Railway's achievement.	2001-03-02

The author employs a classic style with many similarities to Henry James.  Most impressive are the characters, extraordinery monsters portrayed as sympathetic personalities with similar needs as you or I.<br />Merrick, herself, is rich in ambiguity that leaves the reader guessing about her intentions.  My only concern was some redundant dialog.  When David is trying to convince someone of a point, he tends to be repetitive of his arguements.  Since he is the narrator, the repetition comes in words and thoughts.  This is a minor concern that is offset by wonderful settings, language and tension.<br />I look forward to Merrick's impact on the her companions.  A female perspective among the undead can only improve an already popular series.	2001-02-21

The Lion's Game is an intense yarn that rushes from a startling begining to a slightly disappointing conclusion.  John Corey, hero of Plum Island is back with sarcastic humor that brightens up a violent and grim plot.  Asad is the king of the jungle with more dimension then the average fictional mass murderer.  The two protagonists engage in an intriguing duel until the end.  No, I will not give it away.  Yes, it is worth the read despite my ending regrets.

This is the fourth Silva novel I've read.  He continues to portray colorful settings and develop rich/complex characters.  I also enjoy the links he established between the four books.  Over time I forsee the 'six degrees of Daniel Silva.'  While his plot twists leave nothing for granted, you must wait a very long time between key movements in the story.  I found it disturbing and put the book down a few days.  The main character restores artwork with extraordinary patience.  As reader of this yarn, you need to have the same trait.	2001-01-25

I received a very rich perspective about writing and life.  King peels off his skin to reveal an imperfect past with neither shame or rationalization.  He places each memory into a puzzle board revealing a wonderful picture his life and how his experiences affected his stories.  This is especially true after his horrific accident a few years ago.  Between autobiographical bookends to &quot;On Writing' King provides pointers about the craft.  Rather than dealing with the subject in grass blade detail, he broadens the readers viewpoint about key tools and important objectives before putting pen to paper.  It is a lively discussion intended to broaden a writers perspective without constraining their creativity.  Obviously, I enjoyed the book, picked up some excellent ideas about writing, but most importantly, received a lesson about how loving life is the foundation to good writing.	2001-01-21

The plot, although over the top, is interesting.  There is not one character you care for.  All range from obnoxious to horrendous.  Grisham still finds it difficult to end the book.  The only tension during the last fifty pages is continuing to check the last page number, do the math and say, &quot;God!  Will this ever end?&quot;<br />The problem is filler.  We repeatedly watch the first attorney get drunk or the judges walk around the track or the judges confering or the judges betting or . . .   If you just pull scenes that were repeated three or more times, The Bretheren is a novelette.  <br />Jojn Grisham has more potential than this.  Maybe some time off will help or perhaps a collection of short stories might yield great filler-less plots.	2000-12-16

What is so satisfying about Erik Larson's story about the 1900 Galveston, Texas hurricane is that it is all true.  Although Mr. Larsen supports his work with extensive research, his storytelling is superb.  Issac's Storm is informative and emotional.  The reader knows more about science, but also a great deal about human behavior.  The tragedy is clear from the beginning, but the tension is gripping throughout.

While gazing at the castles and timber-framed dwellings, you may not notice that  monster Mercedes coming from behind at 240 kph with no intention of taking  prisoners.  Bob Eaton, Chrysler's CEO,and his stockholders kept their eyes  in the clouds and not on the road in the very intriguing and informative  'Taken for a Ride: How Daimer-Benz Drove Off With Chrysler.&quot;<br />It may  be easy to point fingers at the aggressive exploits of Daimer-Benz's  management, but don't blame the predator for Chrysler's bumbling. It is  Eaton, who kept his own counsel throughout the negotiations before walking  away with a pot of gold, that bears the responsibility.  The other  characters in Detroit, Vegas and Stuttgart are colorful and coniving.  The  losers are the employees and all of us that rooted for Chrysler' swaggering  independence.<br />The uneven pace of the book with too much detail during the  negotiations and not enough in the aftermath deducts one star from a very  interesting and educational business fable.	2000-08-22

He fills those voids with some his own tawdry visions of JFK  Jr.'s darker side.<br />Be assured it is well-written and interesting.

Someone loaned me a worn paperback of 'The Testament' on a long flight and it revived my interest and trust in  Grisham.<br />'The Testament' is rich in setting and character.  I  particularly liked the in-depth perspective of the main character, Mr.  O'Reily.   He was flawed, but more real than many of Grisham's more recent  catalysts.  The legal matters in DC provided decent tension.  The ending  and satisfaction were better than most Grisham epics where the author can't  usually finish stories.<br />The river descriptions get a bit tedious and  Grisham is continuing to be preachy - an unfortunate trend that began in  'The Chamber' and reached a peak of misery in 'The Street Lawyer.'

This murderous attempt on phonetic accuracy  puts a spear into the pace and robs the suspension of disbelief.

The results are interesting.  The basic conscepts about leadership, teamwork and risk-taking can be applied to business challenges.  Some of the examples are taken out of context.  For instance General Jubal Early is honored for his risk-taking as he galloped toward Washington and created panic within the citizens and army. That event was the high point in Early's career. He was a miserable failure throughout the remainder of the war.  That's the challenge of such a book, finding historical figures that consistently made the right decisions.

Unfortunately, &quot;When The Wind Blows&quot; and &quot;Hide &amp; Seek&quot; fall in the same  category -- flat characters, short/choppy chapters, and absurb plots.   Perhaps Patterson feels cursed to be attached to a serial character  in  Alex Cross.  He should take greater care of his literary reputation and  bookselling draw when taking a detour from Cross.  Face it, there are about  100 blank sheets in this book, the type is large and the lines are double  spaced.

You'll find it difficult to breath before the first search ship leaves port.  While it gets exciting at that point,  many readers will bobbing face down before the coins begin to jingle.	1998-07-27

For those, seeking a compelling story, &quot;who cares?&quot; may scream over the beach.  For some of us Civil War buffs, Theresa's final message in a bottle may have a familiar ring to it. Compare the contents of Theresa's prose with Major Sullivan Ballou's last letter to his wife before the battle of Bull Run.  It was probably the most emotional momment of PBS &amp; Ken Burns' CIVIL WAR Series.  The letter is on page 82 of the series book.  Looks like Nicholas Sparks is a historical romantic or something like that.	1998-06-08

Start out on the decks of the Titanic, add a scandalous affair between a priest and an abused wife, force the hero to chose between the stuffy beauty and the golden hearted prostitute, add lots of arguments, and conclude with gunfire.  Sound familiar? 1916 was a great concept.  The poet warriors' futile battle with the British could have spun like Braveheart, but it became a very slow- moving Gun Fight At The OK Corral.	1998-06-02

The hunt was exciting with plenty of twists and turns.  I especially like the way Patterson effectively changes point of view in the narrative.  It is done with great effect. <br /> The villains, Gary Soneji and Mr. Smith, are too over-the-top.  Soneji was chilling in &quot;Along Came A Spider.&quot;  He became a shrill in &quot;Cat&quot;   Mr. Smith's identity is revealed too early, leading to a dragged out, disappointing ending. <br /> Despite the short comings, the novel gets into your head.  It is a good read.	1998-04-09

Both sides develop a synergy which goes beyond clear tangibles and virtues.  When your best friend is famous, and that person dies, the surviving friend has an obligation to seek perspective.  Eugene Kennedy needed more time and distance to adequately honor his friend, the late Cardinal Bernadin.  Kennedy's emotions are too raw.  He seeks sainthood for his friend.  After setting that standard, the book becomes defensive.  Kennedy tries to be poetic, but he can not sustain that type of prose for 175 pages.  In the end Mr. Kennedy tried to honor his friend with emotions and flowery prose.  It would have been better if the author had more confidence in Cardinal Bernadin's own words and deeds.  We would have learned more about a great man than the slim concepts gained from this endeavor.	1998-03-30

Inman and Ada's odyssey  joins other American classics and it will thrive while most best sellers are mulched and recycled. <br /> While much of the prose is alive and colorful, there are too many sentences beginning with Inman this or Ada that.  It lulls the reader into a monotonous daze.  Next  novel, please mix it up.  One wouldn't want to miss a turn on Cold Mountain.  Great Job!!!	1998-03-04

Heaven, opening its arms to the little angels, solemnly and obediently praying with their nun had more spin than Elvin in those days. &quot;To Sleep With The Angels&quot; not only unspun the myths about a tragedy, which led to safety improvements in all American schools, but it brought out the raw emotions of the survivors. <br /> The book is balanced, hesitating to point fingers, trying to put the event into the cultural perspective of the time, and succeeding in forcing each reader in appreciating their own relative heaven. <br /> While ghastly and emotionally devastating, the prose is outstanding, bringing each of us into the doomed class rooms.  This book demonstrates the best drama is on the non-fiction shelves. <br /> In conclusion no monument was ever erected at the site of the fire.  I believe this book may be the lasting tribute to the children, nuns, parents and firefighters forever haunted by the Holy Angel's fire.	1998-02-19

Recovering from wounds and mourning a lost love, Dirk could have been more sensitive, frail and philisophical.  Unfortunately, the bodies in Orion Lake revive our sailor, like spinich.  Dirk becomes Superman, his buddy - Al becomes Batman, and they throw in Superwoman.  <br />  Wow! . . . exciting! . . . oh well!   If you want water and literature, read Walden Pond.

Andrew Greeley rushed a tale with potential just in time for the holiday, but his star faded in my lap. <br /> The first person Irish cynic has been a common narrative style for Fr. Greeley since 'The Cardinal Sins.'  Jack is a false narrator in that his discription of characters lacks credibility with their actions.  Jack changes in how he feels about Odessa, but he doesn't change his outlook on life or humanity.  Our hero remains self-absorbed, even at the end, despite being blessed by a too-perfect heroine. <br /> The basic plot is promising.  Give the family more blotches in action, rather than Jack's words.  Give Odessa more mystery or flaws to enhance her creditbility. Give Jack more problems than a dispute over the country club golf champion.  Give a story like this more time, Fr. Greeley.  Christmas is eternal.  This one could have waited another year.	1997-12-22

The direct hits include her inciteful portrayal of the Queen Mother &amp; Prince Phillip.  We know more about their real personas and motives.  Kelley also demonstrates much of Princess Di is the product of a publicity machine.  I look forward to a genuine account of her in the future . . . at least before she's cannonized. <br /> Kelley is off target on the essence of The Royals, their importance to British self-esteem and their financial importance to the GB economy.  She reports her subjects like a 70's soap opera, not in the spirit of the 1,000 year legacy.  It's too distant . . . too American. <br /> The most disappointing aspect is the thin depth Kelley achieves in finding the soul of Queen Elizabeth.  We never discover her motives.  Some will argue that Kelley could never get that close.  That's the danger of a bomb run over the palace.  You can drop them from thousands of feet, but you're too high to gauge the results.	1997-12-08

The happy hitman, himself, seemed to be growing bored with the replay of a tiring formula.<br /> Jack Higgins took a detour in The President's Daughter which became his most enjoyable journey in years.  There were more subplots than body counts, more character building than action scenes, and more suspense than the yawns of the last four Dillon-based novels.<br /> Higgins has developed quite a few new rogues to match Dillon in future stories.  Hey Jack, return Sean Dillon to the dark side in the next chapter.  He's a villain we could root for.	1997-11-10

Maybe I appreciate seaside tales because I was raised in land-locked Ohio.  I couldn't wait to reopen the book, even when I discovered the bad guy a hundred pages earlier. <br /> Me?  I?  Awfully personal!  That is the problem with the last one hundred pages. The point of view is first person.  A very cynical, sexist, cocky  and genuine first person.  We  know the bad guy.  The narrator's partner is expendible.  We are all in a hurricane.  What's the problem?  &quot;I&quot; can't be killed.  Not by bullets, gas or ocean.  &quot;I&quot; am narrating.  &quot;I&quot; am alive.  For 80% of the book, &quot;I&quot; wasn't relevant to the great tension &amp; intrigue.  There was no tension in the climax because &quot;I&quot; am alive. <br /> It is a shame for the author to have gone so far with a colorful plot, only to lose it at the end.  In this case -- the &quot;I's&quot; don't have it.	1997-10-03

The result is raw, like frostbitten skin.  The honesty is an accusing finger - pointing at the organizers, guides and Sherpas.  The result is a visual and chilling drama that is thin on perspective.  <br /> Krakauer's builds and maintains tension on a widely reported story. Everest's summit pulls us up the mountain.  Colorful characters emerge from his team, and from the wild array of other masochists - playing a wealthy person's 'Russian roulette' in a treachorous, oxygen-starved environment.   <br />  The focal point is not the peaks or faux paux's, but the author, who is searching for his soul in 293 page attempt at peace. Time is the oxygen cannister he seeks.  Time sorts out his own mistakes on a fateful day of triumph and tragedy. Time brings perspective.   <br />  This story and its victims, including the author, scream for a sequel in a couple years.  Without it, this best seller is like a summer action movie - exciting, but very thin on any legacy for literal or figurative climers.	1997-08-25

Sadly, it lacked focus, and more importantly, it was weak on drama. <br /> Fiction or non-fiction, the story needs to be a 'page turner.' For example, the author glossed over the aborted attempt to move marketing headquarters from Rochester to D.C.  The dramatic moment was a   semi, drapped with a protest message by local merchants, parked in front of Kodak Headquarters during a board of directors meeting.  The board freaked and the move was over in a Kodak moment. The author destroys CEO Kay Whitmore's financial judgement, but omitted an infamous memo by Jack Thomas, Whitmore's president, to all employees to reduce everything from postage stamps to toilet paper to achieve fourth quarter earnings.  Wall Street howled and the stock went down with the stamps.  <br /> Without the real drama, Ms. Swasy dabbles in a variety of mundane opinions by employeees, insiders and the community.  The Class of '93, a group of layoff victims, revisited often in the book,  was not generally a sympathetic group. This is especially true of the Coutures, a yuppie couple impacted by layoffs, who sang, 'The world owes me a living,' throughout the book. <br />  Swasy's biggest challenge is that the Kodak story is far from being complete.  The battle with Fuji, the shift to digital, and the change in culture may one day yield a dramatic business case and drama.  'Changing Focus' is a blurred attempt, which falls short.	1997-07-26
