R. Luria,which consists in publishing original research  in literary form, you would love this book. Clearly intellectual scientists are vanishing under the weight of the commoditization of the discipline. But once in a while someone emerges to reverse such setbacks.<br /><br />Goldberg, who was the great Luria's student and collaborator, is even more colorful and fun to read than the master.  He is egocentric, abrasive, opinionated, and colorful. He is also disdainful of the conventional beliefs in neurosciences --for instance he is suspicious of the assignment of specific functions, such as language, to anatomical regions. He is also skeptical of the journalistic \\"triune\\" brain. His theory is that the hemispheric specialization is principally along pattern matching and information processing lines:the left side stores patterns, while the right one processes novel tasks. It is convincing to see that children suffer more from a right brain injury, while adults have the opposite effect.<br /><br />There is a little bit of open plugging of Goldberg's for-profit institute;he would have gotten better results by being subtle. A fre minor points. I did not understand why Goldberg discusses \\"modularity\\", of which he is critical, as if it were the same thing in both  neurobiology and in cognitive science. In neurobiology, modularity implies regional localization, while cognitive scientists (Marr, Fodor, etc.) make no such assumption: for them it is entirely functional and they would be in great agreement with Goldberg. Also I did not understand why he attributes the language instinct to Pinker, not Chomsky, and why he makes snide remarks about behavioral scientists like Kahneman and Tversky. But these are very minor details that do not weaken the message (I still gave the book 5 stars). I am now spoiled; I need more essays by opinionated, original,and intellectual, contemporary scientists.	2005-04-30

Moritz-Maria von Igenfeld, the Pninish uberscholar philologist who wrote the seminal Portugese Irregular Verbs (\\"after which there was nothing left to discuss about the subject, Nothing.\\"). I was curious to see how he would present a female version of such scholar.<br /><br />He did not. Nor was it a detective story, although there is an element of suspense. This book is about Applied Ethics, a subject about which the author seems to know a bit. It also makes you feel like leading a quite thinking life in Edinburgh.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the story but I felt that I was reading a detective story until I realized what it was...	2005-03-19

The sandpile is a great baby model for that.<br /><br />Some people are critical of Bak's approach, some even suggesting that we may not get power laws in these \\"sandpile\\" effects, but something less scalable in the tails.  The point is :so what? The man has vision.<br /><br />I looked at the reviews of this book. Clearly a few narrow-minded scientists do not seem to like it (many did not like Per Bak's ego). But the book is remarkably intuitive and the presentation is so clear that he takes you by the hand. It is even entertaining. If you are looking to find flaws in his argument his pedagogy allows it (it is immediately obvious to us who dabble with simulations of these processes that you need an infinite sandpile to get a pure power law).<br /><br />Another problem. I have been ordering the book on Amazon for ages. Copernicus books does not respond to emails. I got my copy at the NYU library. Bak passed away 2 years ago and nobody seems to be pushing for his interest and that of us his readers  (for used books to sell for 99 implies some demand). This convinces me NEVER to publish with Springer.	2005-02-08

Most of the books are excellent; but, aside from this one (and Jon Baron's) they are usually compilation of original research. I like to have a readable consolidation of the material not far from my figertips. I was lucky to have found this book, which provides a wonderful and comprehensive coverage of the topics.<br />It is limpid, precise, illustrative, showing a wonderful clarity of mind.<br /><br />Now the bad news. The author passed away recently at the age of 48.	2005-01-18

You are paid extremely well, but, again you have plenty of bosses above you (say the partners of an investment firm). Is it better than deriving a modest income being your own boss? The counterintuive answer is NO. You will live longer in the second situation, even controlling for diet, lifestyle, and genetic predispositions.<br /><br />Marmot spent years poring over data; he left no stone unturned and is well read in the general literature on human nature. This idea of people living longer when they exert control over their lives has not spread yet. That people lead longer lives when they trust their neighbors and feel part of a community is far reaching. Just think of the implications on social justice etc. Also think that everything you learn on human preferences and well-being in both economics and medicine is either incomplete (medicine) or bogus (economics).<br /><br />The book is well written, humorous at times, and rigorous --it reads like a well-translated scientific paper. But it feels that it is just the introduction to a topic. Please, write the continuation.	2004-09-28

It hit me at some point that I was at the intersection of readability and scholarship. Clearly the value of this book lies beyond its readability: Gottlieb is both a philosopher and a journalist (in the good sense), not a journalist who writes about philosophy. He investigates and provides a fresh look at the material: For instance what we bemoan as the flaws of Aristotelianism during the scholastic period came 2000 years after his work. Aristotle had an empirical bent --his followers are the ones to blame.<br />I liked his constant questioning of the labels put on philosophers and philosophies by the second hand readers.<br />Clearly he missed a few authors who deserve real coverage like Algazali, but I take what I can get.<br />The only other readable history of philosophy is Russell's. This one was less hurriedly put together.<br /><br />Someone should bug the author to hurry with the sequel on Locke, Hume, etc.	2004-07-28

So I am sure many readers hesitated after a review by such a rigorous big gun thinker as Blackburn.<br />When I started reading the book I was taken aback by the combination of depth and the vividness of the style. Eco is sprightly and alive, something that cannot be said of many philosophers dealing with the subject of categories.<br />The notion of categories is not trivial: you need a simple conditional prior to identify an object; it is a simple mathematical fact. You need to know what a table is to see it in the background separated from its surroundings. You need to know what a face is so when it rotates you know it is still the same face. Computers have had a hard time with such pattern recognition. A PRIOR category is a necessity. This was Kant's intuition (the so-called &quot;rationalism&quot;). This is also the field of semiotics as initially conceived. Eco took it to greater levels with his notion of what I would call in scientific language a compression, a &quot;simplifation&quot;. This leads to the major problem we face today: what if the act of compressing is arbitrary?<br />Not just very deep but it is a breath of fresh air to see such a philosophical discussion nondull, nondry, alive!	2004-04-25

Magee sees things form the inside; it is his own formation of philosophical ideas &amp; techniques that we witness.<br />Magee was close enough to Popper to present us with his ideas first-hand (nobody reads Popper; people read about him). He also debunks a few idiotic myths about Wittgenstein as an atomist (Magee read W and realized that people read commentary on him rarely the original).<br />Magee writes with the remarkable clarity of the English philosophers/thinkers.	2004-04-10

It reviews everything from epistemology to the logic of contingency, with insights here and there about such topics as the observer biases (about computing probabilities when our existence has been linked to a particular realization of the process).<br />I am not a philosopher but a probabilist; I found that this book just spoke to me. It certainly rid me of my prejudice against modern philosophers.	2004-03-20

Humphreys is the only person I know of who can work on nonhuman primates, write philosophy, and  edit a literary magazine.<br />The latter shows in this writing: I read this book in a single sitting. You may not agree with the ideas on consciousness (I don't) but you get a clear exposition of all the work from Descartes to McGinn. Also if you want to figure out what Dennett is saying it helps to read this book first.	2004-02-28

Clearly I do not understand how she was able to work as a journalist when she has the attitude and mindset of a truth-seeker.

It made me feel the plane ride was very short! I should have bought a couple. This is a great book for a refresher in analytical philosophy: pleasant, clear.

I don't  know if it is cultural (the modern English philosopher's fear of displaying passion) but I had the feeling to talk to a plumber who developed expertise in abstract concepts and their relationships just as if they were small plumbing problems fitting together under a generalized plumbing theory. Perhaps philosophy needs to be treated like that, just like engineering --but not for me. At least I give myself the illusion of doing something more...literary.<br />Colin McGINN teaches us that we need nevertheless to master the art of clarity of both thought and exposition. He write with perfect clarity: a clear, unburdened, unaffected, UnFrench UnGerman philosophical prose.<br />The book has a presentation of the Kripke idea of naming as necessity of such clarity that I felt actually smart reading it.<br />Other than that there is the feeling of drabness in part of the book of the type I got once at a conference in an industrial city West of London.	2004-01-20

Since then I've had five years of reading more technical material  (Gazzaniga et al is perhaps the most complete reference on cognitive neuroscience) and thought that I transcended this book.<br />But it was not so. I picked up this book again last weekend and was both astonished at a) the ease of reading , b) the clarity of the text and c) the breadth of the approach! I was looking for a refresher as I am trying to capture a general idea of the functioning of that black box and found exactly what I needed without the excess burden of prominent textbooks. Very pedagogical.<br />I read here and there comments by neuroscientists dissing the book over small details perhaps invisible even to experts. I just realize that Carter should keep updating it, as it is invaluable in my suitcase when I travel! I do not conceal my suspicion of &quot;science writers&quot; and journalists more trained in communicating than understanding and usually shallow babblers but Carter is an exception. Perhaps the science of the mind requires breadth of knowledge that she has. She is  a thinker in her own right not just a &quot;medical journalist&quot;.	2003-12-15

Fodor	This critique of the computational theory of mind and the pan-adaptionist tradition is clearly so honest that it goes after the ideas promoted by Fodor's own 1983 watershed book &quot;The Modularity of Mind&quot;. In brief the essay is an attack on massive modularity by saying that there are things after all that escape the programming (encapsulation and opacity are key: how can we talk about something OPAQUE? We know nothing about a few critical things...).<br />Granted the book is horribly written (that is Fodor's charm after all) but his argumentation is so ferocious that he ends up loud &amp; clear.<br />The man is critical of his own ideas, and of the current in thought that he he helped create --one may use Fodor-1 against Fodor-2. Perhaps persons I hold in highest respect are those who go after their own ideas!<br />Bravo Fodor. Even if I do not agree I can't help admiring the man.	2003-11-10

I now carry a copy on my trips as I can kill time in airports by perusing random sections.<br />The book is so readable as to perhaps set a standard.

I don't know why his approach makes it clearer and deeper than those of Watts and Barabasi --is it due to his using financial markets as a base? or his being an expert at fat-tailed dynamics?<br />His work builds on the &quot;abyssus abyssum invocat&quot; (panic begets panics) and the dynamics of compounding disequilibria. In addition the notion of &quot;CRITICAL POINT&quot; is made very clear.<br />Honestly I don't care for the idea of crashes; the same concepts can apply to sudden and unexpected euphorias.<br />I learned more from this book than any other on disequilibrium.	2003-08-27

A lunacy people would have thought. Most risk management is like that: we think backwards with the benefit of past history and find these ideas obvious. They were not at the time.<br />Throughout his career Shiller stood for unpopular ideas and was proven right (his 1981 paper on volatility, his 2000 discussion of the bubble).

One would think that the repetition of experiences with consistent forecasting biases would lead to some correction but this is not the case.<br />We are more resilient than we think (&quot;immune neglect&quot;). The book also discusses the reversion to baseline happiness after what we thought would bring a permanent improvement in our moods (yet we never learn from it).<br />The most important part covers the &quot;hindsight bias&quot; how we see past misfortunes as deterministic --and how we can confront negative emotions by making them even more so (by creating a narrative that make the events appear unavoidable).	2003-05-12
