Malia's book was cited lots. I didn't have it, and was starting to feel that &quot;I'm missing something&quot; sensation. So I went on a bookstore crawl and found Russia Under Western Eyes. <br />This is a good book.<br />I enter this rather tentatively. I don't usually comment on what I call &quot;real books&quot; even though I read them, feeling that I don't have the qualifications. Ye Olde BA doesn't seem to mean much, anymore. <br />On the other hand, if you are an educated person who generally flees at high speed from &quot;intellectual history&quot;, read this. <br />Malia is not a socialist. He may or may not deconstruct in other books, for all I know he is a firm believer in what Kelly Neff refers to as literary donatism (which is all I believe deconstruction is in the end). In this book he writes as if you were meant to read it, which makes a nice change.<br />He chooses to bounce Western intellectual history off dreams of Russia. Is there anything new in it? No. His point is simple and (if you bothered to pay any attention to pre-Revolutionary Russia) glaringly obvious. On the other hand, we are so enamoured of the disaffected intelligent from the 1860's on that we ignore what they were painfully aware of - their ideas were adapted from the West. It irritated them, but there it was. The West has consistently shown a tendency to bounce its ideals and its nightmares off Russia; as a point for guidance in a sea of material, it's not a bad one.<br />Malia doesn't like what communism did to Russia. Neither do I. Anyone who stands up and says communism was a bad thing tends to get a &quot;good boy!&quot; from me. Good little socialists, beware: he handles hard and soft versions of the ideal briskly. The reviewer who wants to make him an embittered right-winger needs to do a re-think, and maybe a re-read without the blinkers; Malia mentions that Europe asked if Russia was part of it, he never questions it. Malia points up a pattern - Russia tends to hit similar points of politics and economics about 50 years after the West. OK, but this doesn't mean Russia is out of the modern world, and Malia says so. That, in fact, was part of the problem.<br />Ask the average Russian if he'd like to live like an American without having to be one. He'd probably say &quot;Bring it on!&quot; We're still letting the disaffected intelligentsia form our opinions - oh, suburbia, too boring, such ennui, oh, the deadening of our souls by wealth! Our souls are our personal responsibility, and poverty in my view is miserable, not enlightening. Sharing the wealth is a fine thing, provided that we remember that the point is to have no more poor, not reduce everyone to an identical level of penury. <br />Malia gets it right, the book is interesting if not new, and it remembers that the question the socialists never ask is, in your new society of fulfillment, who handles the garbage?	2002-03-11
US	52691218	R2UFKGZAO1OJ	0671318489	671131382	Shiva Option	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Heaving a Deep Sigh	The Shiva Option, for those of you who aren't (like me) David Weber fanatics and actually have a reasonably well-paying day-job, should be bought in paper, borrowed from a friend or the library. It's too much money for what it ends up being.<br />In Death Ground blew me away. It was so tight I had trouble breathing, and I was sobbing openly when Antonov and Avram died. So when I heard about The Shiva Option, I cheered and pre-ordered it. When I got it, I opened it and settled in for a long, happy read. <br />Even though I read fast, I couldn't possibly get through over 600 pages in one evening, and have a life of my own. So Shiva spilled over into another day. <br />Then, oh dear, I found myself editing. <br />This is a bad sign. I didn't draw my red pencil, because the mistakes weren't grammatical, they were matters of two adverbs in one sentence, or an unnecessary addition, i.e., \\"without doubt, certainly,\\" which is near the end and sticks in my head. It sticks because by the time I got to that one, the red pencil tempted me. <br />Granted, that's a matter of taste, not grammar. On the other hand, it's indicative of what's wrong with this book, and why I'm only giving it three stars. <br />The Shiva Option is too long. It's also too choppy - and how can I say that when we have 20 to 40 page passages for a single battle? - there are different viewpoints on each battle (and yeah, yeah, yeah, I know we have to have the bug's eye view (pardon me), but oh, lord, did it annoy me) and we have the Bugs' opinion. I don't care about the Bugs' opinion, they are the bad guys, and they're incomprehensible, so why bother?<br />And let's face it, there are only so many ways to say, \\"We killed lots and lots and lots of them.\\"<br />I've been contemplating the pitfalls of the word processor, recently, and I think that it may be at fault, here. <br />I have long loved David Weber, and nothing, but nothing will sway me from my loyalty. No matter what, I'll buy anything he writes in hardbound, and down it at one gulp, or as close to one as I can manage. This one just wasn't up to the mark.<br />Steve White made an unfortunate impression on me when he grabbed the Sarmatian bucket legend and ran with it, but that's quite another review. <br />As usual, I haven't kept up with the \\"gossip\\", so I don't know who wrote what. I am not a literary scholar who can analyze word usage and do the same. I just don't care that much about the writers, I care about the words on the page. This book disappointed me. <br />I'm betting the next Weber book I get won't.	2002-03-01
US	52691218	R2DU6VKOZVJNZ9	0380788306	824132292	Europa Strike: Book Three of the Heritage Trilogy	Books	3	13	16	N	Y	Trying to Be Helpful. Really.	&quot;Not a bad little trilogy, and it moves right along,&quot; is the basic comment. There is some quite interesting Marine Corps history embedded and the combat sequences are quite enjoyable. Not a book to keep you on the edge of your seat or up all night, but it is mind candy for the commuter.<br />The specifics of what I do and don't like about this book follow. <br />I enjoyed the science speculations. The discussion of propulsion systems and the understanding of orbital dynamics was quite good. Or at least didn't send me hunting for my &quot;for dummies&quot; textbooks with a desperate sense of something wrong, here. The combat sequences are good, especially the sense of surreality when fighting in vacuum, where you don't hear anything that doesn't come over your com. The history lessons were welcome, and not overdone. <br />On the other hand, the politicians once again take a pasting, while the military acts as it never has and with any sort of luck never will in a democracy. <br />This is a weakness of a great deal of military SF, by the way. The authors all seem to luxuriate in the fantasy of a political establishment that either is on the military's side, or too far away to effect the outcome of an action, or (best of all) can be worked around without ever really abrogating the notion of civilian control. <br />Ian Douglas managed to portray a civilian here and there who wasn't completely incompetent.  In this trilogy, we get to see a couple civilians who don't end up soldier types, with guns in their hot little hands, portrayed as both competent and good guys. <br />The archeologist characters were interesting. I liked their rationality in the face of discoveries that would tempt anyone into blind credulity. <br />I had a certain amount of trouble with the premise of the good old Ancient Astronauts thing. That isn't Douglas' fault, by the way, it's a fun premise, and provides a good reason for humanity to finally get off the planet. (If you want the bestreason of all, try reading Killing Star - which is hair-raising.) I'm just tired of it, that's all. At least Douglas resisted the temptation to stage an intervention.<br />The politics are interesting in so far as Douglas seems convinced that the lunatic fringe is as big and dumb as I fear it is in my gloomier moments. In some way, the fact that most people who want to turn off their brains are currently either quiet or fragmented into so many tiny little sects that they make no difference has removed them from view. Douglas, who evidently reads a lot of the same stuff I do, has noticed that they're there, they don't pay a whole lot of attention to the real work being done in history and archeology, and yep, they are dangerous.<br />Now, there's an interesting phenomenon I noted in all three of these books. In the first four chapters there are lots of problems with grammar, and pretty obvious ones at that. After that, they settle down. In Europa Strike, the problem is worse than that - Douglas doesn't remember who's who. He added a character who is the child of another main character, and unfortunately forgot to proof carefully enough in the first four chapters, so we have the old main character referred to by his son's name. The confusion is straightened out in the fifth chapter between one paragraph and the next. <br />Oh, dear.<br />This did not make me happy. I thought it was a lazy, sloppy sort of mistake. Most of the errors - including the grammar - were like that - I didn't feel that Douglas doesn't know the difference, just didn't pay enough attention to catch them.<br />Overall, not bad, and I wouldn't discourage you from buying these.	2001-08-20
US	52691218	R27JYPIKRJXH1S	0671318268	93603767	March to the Sea	Books	4	47	52	N	Y	Kudos to Weber &amp; Ringo	This was great. Buy it, it's definitely worth the hard-bound price.<br />Why do I say so?<br />David Weber is very good at plot and action. He keeps me on the edge of my seat in all of his books, even the ones I'm not crazy about. OK, there are more elegant writers and his characterization isn't all that great. Since I'm not inclined to favor characters who spend all their time navel-gazing, I don't mind. <br />John Ringo has my interest piqued. I picked up A Hymn Before Battle on one of my desperation bookstore crawls, partly because anyone who quotes Kipling can't be all bad, and partly because the premise looked interesting. The sight of humanity getting pasted but still keeping on always fills me with delight. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Gust Front was great fun, too. There is some concern that maybe Ringo's getting too much attention too fast, but I'm not going to worry until his books get sloppy.<br />March Upcountry was good; this is better. I'm not able to say who wrote what, but I do feel that Ringo filled in some of Weber's holes, in much the same way that Pournelle and Niven help each other. The characters felt more solid, and the dialogue less wooden, than happens all too often with David Weber. <br />In terms of plotting, I can't say any of it was unexpected, no. Somebody once pointed out that only a limited number of themes and plots exist, and all you can really do is ring some changes on them. The changes rung, in this case, were entertaining, and my interest never faltered. I was deeply relieved when they didn't have the Prince back-sliding into his old ways, which I half-expected. Neither author, though, seems to feel obliged to cover the same territory twice, and I'm relieved.<br />I love the alien allies. I recognize them, especially the cavalry types, and (since I adored Rafael Sabatini) the whole swashbuckling crew is welcome to hang 'round. Buckle that swash, guys!<br />There is a nice, nice little bit (speaking as a female, and I hope I'm not giving too much away) about how a man ought to treat a woman, if he's in the public view. After the idiocy we have endured in the past few years, a gentle reminder about dalliance and honor was welcome. <br />If I have a real caveat, it's this: we have got to stop killing so many trees. Now, granted, paper is made from &quot;trash pine&quot; and not the redwoods, but there has to be a line. We encourage our authors (because we love them) to write long books with sequels, or, if you prefer, one very long book broken into volumes. This is partly the fault of the word-processor which has made editing so much easier - in the days when you had to cut and paste, you thought a long time about re-writes. You also, if you couldn't afford the services of the ten-fingered (I'm quoting Tolkien), had to type the silly thing yourself. While the computer keyboard encourages carpal tunnel syndrome because there is so little resistance to the keys, the same ease and spell-checker make it much, much easier to keep writing.<br />So the books keep getting longer.<br />This does worry me, just a little. It lets authors throw in the kitchen sink, indeed almost obliges them to. This isn't always a great idea.<br />Over the years of reading Weber, I've noted that he produces clean copy; either he proof-reads with some attention, or he types well. Ringo's two were also fairly clean. I didn't get annoyed enough to draw my red pencil. Better yet, in March to the Sea, I was so entertained that I didn't note any errors. <br />So go get it, and let the guys get their royalties so they can keep writing.	2001-08-02
US	52691218	R2O6DKIXEBNLDL	0061052604	173162111	Hammerfall (Gene Wars)	Books	4	1	2	N	Y	I Pre-Ordered this Before it had a Title	I had a very long wait for this book. I ordered it back in March of 2000, if you can believe it, before it was even titled. At that point I don't think anyone was anticipating over a year's wait.<br />Was it worth it?<br />Oh, yes. This was a very sophisticated book, with a very attractive protagonist in a fascinating culture, containing glimpses of highly advanced technology. The plot, by C.J. Cherryh standards, was straightforward; the implications and ramifications are left for the reader a bit more than she has in past books. She hints at them. <br />Our protagonist starts out thinking he's mad. I was drawn in, and I liked the way he toughed his situation out, and the way he never stopped thinking. I have commented in the past that Cherryh really does write extraordinarily well about smart people and their internal lives. This book bears that out. If I have a caveat, it's that the character's voice is a bit too familiar, if you've read the Foreigner books. <br />In a bit of a departure (as far as I can tell), Cherryh uses some lyrical descriptive passages. <br />The main caveat I have with this can't be discussed without giving a major plot device away. But nanotech (very popular right now as a mcguffin) is interesting stuff. On the other hand, ask yourself about mechanisms when you run into it in the course of the story.<br />Anyway, yes, this is definitely worth the hardbound price.	2001-07-26
US	52691218	R1UFR845TEMRHH	0671319752	272498178	Changer of Worlds (Worlds of Honor #3)	Books	3	23	25	N	Y	Honor, Treecats and Politics	Changer is worth having, bottom line. Ok? It's on the keeper shelf, and I had to move my sagas (the real thing) to fit it and begin leaving room for the next set of Honor Harringtons. Now to what's good and bad.<br />Again, I complain that the treecats are getting too cute. I'm sorry, David, but they just aren't plausible to me. Not because of size, or a great many other easy objections, covered with a certain amount of neatness in the &quot;teach them to sign&quot; part of Ashes of Victory. I just can't quite believe in them as written. Annoying, by the bye, because I really want to believe in the treecat sentience. Sigh. Their society doesn't feel workable, as it is shown. Granted, oral history can be remarkably accurate up to 500 years back, and sometimes, in traditional societies without literacy, there are feats of memorization that astound us urban, literate types. I am objecting here to feel - it's all too damn pat. <br />So anyway, onward.<br />I really loved Ms. Midshipwoman Harrington, even if I did nearly type in Hornblower. I liked the portrait of an incompetent and cruel superior, who needed to be worked around by the command. I'm glad they did. Honor gets to be a hero - we knew she had been from early in her career - and handle having command fall on her head in a bad situation in a beautiful bit of space combat. I loved that - the whole battle sequence was so well written I was literally holding my breath until spots began dancing before my eyes. Very, very good stuff!<br />Nightfall answered my objection in Ashes of Victory that Weber shouldn't kill off major characters off-stage. I enjoyed it, though I admit that knowing the ending kind of took the edge of tension off it. I rooted for Esther McQueen. I did think Weber offed Rob S. Pierre a little to fast and casual, but it was well written and I wish the sequence could have made it into Ashes. Although given the length of that book, perhaps that was a good editorial decision on Weber's part.<br />Does it sound like I've been holding off on commenting on Eric Flint's contribution? I'm afraid I have been.<br />Now, to be absolutely fair: Flint's &quot;about the author&quot; description describes him as an unregenerate Trotskyist. Having spent my college career on the Soviets, and exploring the really interesting splitting of semi-Marxist sects in America, I have developed some very strong opinions, and they aren't flattering to the ideology and its true believers. <br />It makes me uneasy to comment on From the Highlands because it was better written than many of Flint's other efforts, and he didn't editorialize quite so badly. Oh, yeah, he did editorialize and lecture the reader, mostly about politics and who should believe what. I liked the plot, I liked the writing (and I'm thrilled that Flint managed to restrain his verbal tics, this time out) and the action sequences. The combat was good. <br />Now, my objections crystalized in the moment where Flint has the State Sec officer heroically standing as a true defender of the Revolution, hard as steel. ARGH! To reach a truly disgusting level of brutality, bring on the knights of the revolution. Anybody remember Felix Dzerzhinski besides me? Anybody remember what Trotsky did to restore discipline in the Red Army in 1920? The defenders of the revolution will cut your throat quite impersonally. Isn't that nice, to know that you were just of the wrong class, or in the wrong place? <br />That style of politics, the Gryphon Highlanders one and all haters of their aristocracy, and willing to contemplate blood feud. The renegade noblewoman (oh, please, can we please lose the notion that this is somehow a great thing?) who views her class through that particular lens (let's not forget that the notion of a class traitor, once introduced, however positively, leads inexorably to the negative and justifies a lot of bad stuff)and the Solly masses being kept down, dumb, and ignorantly happy...ARGH! again. <br />Look, it's notthat it wasn't fun. But the century just past has made me wary as can be of ideology (I almost misspelled that on purpose but decided it would be too cute), and the notion that all a messianic movement needs is pure enough hearts willing to defend it. Flint managed to make a mess of my enjoyment of the story with this, and I wanted to cry. I wanted to just enjoy the story, and I got this. <br />So much for my opinions. I'd give this a four if Flint had managed to restrain his politics.	2001-04-18
US	52691218	R3JSTWG2KWGL72	0441007953	586333322	They Also Serve (Society of Humanity, Bk. 3)	Books	3	14	17	N	N	Harmless, Generally Speaking	I picked this one up because I needed commute reading. Over-all, it's unobjectionable, a fast read. It's not memorable and if you've read as much SF as I have, it was predictable. So what? It did its job, and the story was fun.<br />There were a couple things I thought could have been better. We have a lost colony plunked down on a &quot;teaching&quot; world that can't seem to make contact with the colonists. I don't find that convincing on its face, but I let it ride. I object more seriously to the ending, which I won't give away, though you can probably guess it. Moscoe ducked the serious issue of co-existence with true machine intelligence. That, by the way, is fair enough. If what you want to write is entertainment, then you don't need to get into the whole messy issue of what sentience is, and how do you deal with the other. <br />Moscoe comes down on the &quot;Can't we all just get along?&quot; end of the spectrum. The main characters started out on different sides and finished close friends. No one is a goody-two-shoes, but when a character is portrayed as a seriously bad person, the driving force behind that personality (utter selfishness) is well potrayed and consistent. There are the usual clueless civilians, which I found tiresome, but hey. Most military types view civilians as easiest to protect by ensuring they never get close to the action. <br />There was a fault of diction that drove me bats. Moscoe, at least twice, uses &quot;disburse&quot; for &quot;disperse.&quot; Anyone who doesn't understand the different roots of these two words should see me after class...well, no. Let me explain. Disperse comes from the Latin &quot;dispersus&quot;, which comes from particle dis + spargere &quot;to strew.&quot; Thus, English disperse, meaning &quot;to scatter&quot; in its briefest definition. Got that? <br />Disburse comes from Old French, composed of the Latin particle dis + Old French bourse, which means purse in the sense of &quot;where you keep your money.&quot; So we arrive at English &quot;disburse&quot;, meaning &quot;to pay out.&quot; <br />They are nowhere near being the same word, and it made me squawk. May a decently educated reader ask who is proof-reading this stuff? There was other stuff, but the disburse for disperse was egregious!<br />Anyway, as I said, harmless. Read it in paper, and then sell it.	2001-03-26
US	52691218	R3VT4YUFITBE0Q	0741404990	946081333	We All Fall Down	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	Ambiguity as a Stance	This book makes for ambiguous feelings in a reviewer. In me, anyway.<br />First, I don't like Jimmy. I just don't. His anger, throughout the book, made me weary. I never reached a point where I cared that much. Oh, I understood - if the Apocalypse happened, I suspect I'd be just as irritated with God as Jimmy is. But this man has so much rage, and sees so much ugliness, deliberately, tht I never managed to reach the point of true sympathy I need to enjoy the book.<br />The foul language is pointless, except right in the beginning, where it's used to delineate Jimmy's essentially angry character. I did wonder what he was like to live with for 12 years (this is mentioned in the first paragraph), and when he mentions that he smiled when his wife was &quot;raptured&quot; and when he met her, I felt these were the only times he did smile. <br />This is better than a couple other &quot;Christianity is real&quot; books I've read. It's better written, though I was thoroughly tired of it well before I finished it. And since it's under 300 pages of mid-size type, that's not good. On the other hand, Caldwell is at least trying to put some flesh on a character who is trying to deal with the Apocalypse. <br />Big, big caveat - this is first person narration. The main character dies. How is he telling us the story? I don't approve of this, because that's not how it works, and this book, while enamoured of the modern fiction conventions of unsympathetic protagonist and ugly lives, isn't artsy enough to carry it.<br />I wouldn't have picked this up if someone hadn't asked me what I thought of it. I don't entirely regret buying it, and I'll hang onto it to look over as I check back on this page, but it's a book to approach only if you are feeling tolerant.<br />Personally, I am not a believer, but a thoughtful agnostic. The current flurry of Revelations based books interests me, and I can't say I quite understand who they're aimed at. You have to admit the concept is staggering, andit could be fun. I won't argue faith with anyone, for the very good reason that I'm more ambiguous than Jimmy is about God. This particular book isn't badly written, and is more interesting and less preachy than the Jenkins-LeHaye books, but it's still not incredibly good. <br />Not a bad read, over-all, just not what I would pick on my own.	2001-03-16
US	52691218	RWHFNF3ZXNUCW	0553575813	740373561	The White Tribunal	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Caveats all over the place, but I like it anyway	The strange thing is, reading the editorial review I couldn't disagree - the thing about &quot;characters by the numbers&quot; is close to being right. Except for one thing: Paula Volsky wrote a good book here, and a rational one. <br />What's good? The plot - not especially original, perhaps - is that of the innocent wronged. The difference is, unlike the Count of Monte Cristo, the innocent, when he comes to take his revenge, doesn't enjoy it. The first object of his vengeance (incidentally, I wouldn't have bothered with this one) never understands what she did, or why vengeance should be called for. In the second case, though the person involved originally behaved badly, Tradain misses the point of the man's personal redemption, but still feels guilty. As he should.<br />One comment here - I felt that Volsky could have done a great deal more with the redemption of a human soul here than she did. And Tradain missing the point, or ignoring it, weakened the denoument. It could have been done better, yes, but I was glad to see it done at all. <br />Another of those quibbles - our heroine, Glennian, somehow doesn't figure out that her guardian is the one who betrayed her family? Huh? This girl's supposed to be a genius, or close to it. Nope, sorry, Paula, you blew that one.<br />The ironic tone is nice. When your main subject matter is the destruction of the innocent under horrific circumstances, a little distance is necessary. The demonstration, through Aestine and Drempi, of how people end up coerced into supporting the witch-hunt is neatly done. Neither of these two characters is especially strong, and perhaps Volsky slights the process of deliniating character. I would complain that even our main character lacks complexity, except that Volsky deliberately demonstrates how stunted he becomes in solitary confinement. I'm not thrilled, but I enjoyed it so much that I decided that I'd just let it slide while reading it.<br />Let's not pretend that I didn't like it mostbecause I detest mass hysteria, and the witch-craze makes me more than a little ill. The Tribunal is ugly and deserves its end. The premier jurist, a self-righteous monster, actually was fairly convincing.<br />The best moments are little sketches: in the years Tradain has been imprisoned, the number of sorcery-repelling charms on the gates of the city have increased from one to six. The fear doesn't diminish, but grows. The White Tribunal takes more and more, and is never satisfied. <br />Over all, recommended.	2001-02-07

On the other hand, I happen to like it, and believe in the doctor as hero. So I have a predisposition to like this book. And I do.<br />Endurance is good fun, and the heroine's tribulations are quite interesting. The bad guys are really bad, which means that when they get their come-uppance, you feel good. As a caveat, I don't believe that the baddies would tolerate Cherijo's interference as often as they do. Some characters you think are going to be horrible turn out to be sympathetic. There is, if you've read the two before this, the expected character with whom Cherijo begins in conflict with, and becomes allied to. There are further revelations about Cherijo's attributes as a genetic construct, one of which led to a question - which I leave you to guess at.<br />Biggest complaint: Cherijo's supposed to be smart, and there's a plot twist which I figured out the second time we saw the character. I don't know if other readers will, but I spotted it coming.<br />Over all, this is good, innocent fun. You won't suffer by buying this, and you'll have a pleasant time.	2001-01-11
US	52691218	R3RJZ7PK5OCMAL	0553106635	549456361	A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)	Books	2	40	74	N	Y	Lord of the Rings This Ain't	I solemnly declare that, as I write this, I am of sound mind, and not under the influence of any mind-altering chemicals. I'm only on my first cup of coffee, so we can't even blame caffeine for what I'm about to say.<br />This book, and this series, are mediocre at best. All these five-star reviews worry me, because this installment certainly didn't rate it. To deal in brass tacks, Martin's best aspect is his willingness to kill off main characters. It's a relief to be rid of a few people. He writes adequately. But this is going on too long, and I just don't care enough about these people (any of them) to want to read yet another 800 pages.<br />I see that this series is scheduled for six books. Please, no!<br />Look, guys, didn't any of you stay awake during your western civ courses, or your European history? Martin is playing with, and severely compressing, the Wars of the Roses. I don't mind, except that I'm tired to death of all these reviews raphsodizing over Martin's world-building. It's quite, quite recognizeable.<br />Now, for these people comparing the Lord of the Rings and this stuff...<br />Pay attention: Lord of the Rings is roughly 1200 pages. In those pages, you are presented with a world that is both recognizeable and exotic. There is heroism, and the vilest treachery, and small figures who achieve greatness. The reader is presented with a profound, wise, tolerant worldview in beautiful, lyrical, and what's more, appropriate, language. So many of us have grown up on Tolkien, we don't appreciate how extraordinary he was. More, many readers don't realize how incredibly erudite he was, and how internalized his knowledge. Middle Earth is Tolkien's personal codification of the literature and history he studied. Because most of us are pig-ignorant of that literature and history, and Tolkien's sources, we don't understand his accomplishment.<br />Middle Earth is not a Manichean universe, as one reviewer insisted. That's an over-simplification brought on by superficial reading and Tolkien's gift for drawing us into sympathy with the protagonists. Remember, Frodo does not succeed in destroying the Ring. Gollum/Smeagol bites off the finger the Ring is on, and falls to his death, taking the Ring with him. Gandalf, the personification of &quot;good&quot;, rallies and encourages the leaders of the West. But who destroys the ring-wraith king? Merry, a hobbit who hasn't done much else in the whole book except be cheerful and brave.<br />Anyway, those are mere examples of what is great in Tolkien. By comparison, Martin's books are pitiful.<br />In 2400 pages and counting, what have we seen? Muddled human beings, and what's more, people I, at least, can't care for. Who cares who dies? By the time I was half-way through this volume, not me. I'm tired of the whole thing. I want it over with. Unless there's a republican revolution, this stuff is boring.<br />Martin has done his best to make some characters more sympathetic. We're supposed to change our view of certain characters because they have larger concerns than their own hides. Guess what? Everyone does, and it doesn't make them virtuous. And there is nothing, nothing happening in this book that justifies - gulp - 4800 pages.<br />We don't need to kill this many trees. Let's start encouraging authors to finish their work in a reasonable space.	2001-01-09

If four and a half were possible, that's what I'd put in. <br />Expecting Someone Taller riffs on Wagner. Fortunately, for those of you who ran out of video-tape or patience somewhere around the middle of the Ring Cycle, and aren't real sure what was happening in the parts you did watch, Tom Holt provides a plot summary. This tells you all you need to know about the Ring, and saves those who do not love opera from feeling that the whole thing has gone right over their heads. <br />This book is convulsively funny. Malcolm Fisher runs down a badger whose dying words are, &quot;Funny, I was expecting someone taller.&quot; I opened it on my evening commute some years ago, and transferred to a bus full of people who had not been conditioned by smothered giggles to ignoring me. I read the line (I know I shouldn't quote, but I just can't resist), &quot;Thank you, Please come again.&quot; I laughed out loud, and didn't stop laughing for several blocks. My fellow passengers, needless to say, were astonished. <br />Tom Holt does that to you. He knows his material, and has a great deal of fun ringing changes on it, and adheres to a certain mad logic. This one, especially, is very, very good. My copy is taped together. I still laugh when I re-read it. Yes, it's mad, but it's immense fun, and I recommend this whole-heartedly.	2001-01-08

Fine. There has been plenty going on to carry it.<br />But this one!<br />I don't read &quot;Romance&quot; novels because I get bored with plot-lines that have little to offer beyond sex. And that's all this was. There were maybe fifty pages of actual action involved. The set-up was interesting; we have a princess in hiding, and her relatives are her most dangerous enemies. OOH! What a premise! But nothing happens!<br />Our heroine does maybe four things in the entire novel. Beyond that, we have lots and lots and lots of sex. This was a yawner. I guess I'm just not enough of a voyeur to enjoy it.<br />Don't buy this in hard bound. If you decide to buy it at all, school yourself to patience, because there isn't much plot here.	2000-12-17

I have no rave to give it, but I won't smack it around harshly either. I like the fact that Esmay Suiza finally gets to act with proper confidence, and I loved the jailbreak more-or-less led by civilians. I liked the ship-board scenes.<br />What Moon does right is her action. No one has to display superhuman abilities, even with extremely high tech there is no deus-ex-machina. The politics are half-way reasonable. But only half-way. For one thing, at no point in these books have I believed the society shown could be ruled as discussed. It's just not reasonable, because power doesn't move as shown. Compare, for instance, the Familias Regnant with David Weber's Manticore. <br />I liked the bargain Brun (who is almost a reasonable character in this book) has to make for power. Achilles' choice, indeed. Moon's discussion of what might happen in a society with a rejuvenation ability was quite good. <br />My problem with this book is the same I've had with a couple others: complete anti-climax as an ending. There is no satisfying denoument. It all ends in a bit of a muddle, with no resolution of the real problems, and (sorry), a terribly unearned tear-jerking scene at the end. Yeah, I have some absent friends, and it brought them to mind, and I snivelled. But it isn't real. <br />The title made no sense, but titles are not my thing. At least Moon works on the grammar, so it doesn't drive me nuts, and her style is always clean. <br />She needs to work on her endings, though.	2000-12-17

In all honesty, this is much more conventional. It's a fine read, and won't challenge your sensibilities or your equilibrium.<br />What does Matthews get right?<br />First of all, her technology is well thought-out and believable. She writes this one in good old transparent third-person narration, which is pleasant. While I loved all three Andrej Koskuiscu novels, there were times when the more dramatic breaks of sentence would send me back to the start of the paragraph to figure out what, precisely, was happening. Justice gets handed out, always a pleasant ending. <br />What does she get wrong?<br />Matthews writes her characters as much more simple and unitary than I guess I believe people to be. Her characters may tell themselves something, but they don't have the doubter, the mocker, the comforter and so on talking back. One doesn't feel that her characters ever find an empty room crowded, if you can follow what I mean. The society pictured here felt wrong - how to explain that? Not morally repugnant, as the society surrounding the Bench is, just overly simplified. The beginning impressed me, the &quot;What are we waiting for?&quot; response to disaster felt right. But the society of Jneers, Admin and Mechs felt non-functional. It just wouldn't work. And her heroine wasn't presented as resilient enough to manage the transition from class one to class three. Nope. The villain felt closest to real, but even so, he felt cartoonish. <br />I wanted to like this book much more than I did. I kept going back and trying to figure out if I was missing something (if this was a satire, sorry, but I missed it), and I couldn't come up with it, if I were. <br />This isn't perfect, by any means, but it's worth reading.	2000-10-25

I have serious reasons for slapping a 2-star on this review, but I'm sorry to do it. I want to be positive about this endless opus, and I just can't do it. Kate Elliott wants to write a major novel. She has forgotten what most major novelists bear in mind: finish the story!<br />There is no point in summarizing, or trying to, 800+ pages and (at a quick mental count) six plot lines. 1000 words isn't enough room, and by the time the summary was finished, there would have been butchery done. <br />There is too much underbrush here. There are too many plots. Even David Brin remembers that more than four plots (sub or otherwise) are quite enough. At a certain point, you can't remember - or care! - who is doing what or why one person is doing this or that. Elliott, every once in a while, has to take time out of the plot and summarize. This is tiresome. <br />It's much too late to advise her, but an editor, or her reading group, ought to have urged her to drop a few of her plot-lines. There is no point in saying that she's trying to reflect real life, where everything is complicated. The reader ceases to care.<br />I began this, the third book in what I hoped was a trilogy (and let's not go into how tired I am of 2400-page trilogies), in the patient expectation of a resolution. At four hundred pages, I was more than ready for the end. I was tired of everyone. I took a deep breath, polished my disbelief suspenders, refreshed my reader's good will, and plunged forward, thinking &quot;One last push, and we're done!&quot; <br />Well, no.<br />Around page six hundred, I began to suspect, with a sort of weary horror, that Elliott wasn't done. <br />Now, I waited for this one in paper. The next one won't get bought, even in paper, because I'm sick to death of this story. <br />Kate Elliott isn't a bad writer. In fact, I think she's got potential. But this Crown of Stars thing is getting annoying, and I refuse to reward her. I don't know if the problem is that she doesn't know where she's going, or has gotten bogged down in way too many sub-plots, or (worst thought) she thinks this story deserves 3200 pages. It doesn't. <br />Don't buy this, don't read it. Maybe at some point Kate Elliott will take an axe to the undergrowth and produce an actual, readable novel. Buy that, not these.	2000-10-25

It was actually pointed out to me by a professor I  handed it off to. So, here we go on why this is a classic of its  genre.<br />First of all, I wish to point out that I call this &quot;silly  literature&quot; purely because Amazon won't let me use its proper name  because they think it's a drug reference. Really, the field is  &quot;literature composed by cranks&quot;. Ah, well.<br />The first time I  opened this book, I was deceived into thinking it was the perfect example  of silly literature 101. There were exclamation marks, italics, the mention  of ley lines and the Knights Templar. I was delighted.<br />As I read on,  though, I became more and more puzzled. One of the hallmarks of silly lit  is that it has copious references. When you check those references, you  discover the other hallmark: source torture. No crank would dream of making  an unsupported assertion, good heavens, no!, but for a reference to be  relevant, it usually has to be read in a forced sense. This happens to be  one of my delights.<br />Gardner's assertions are fun, borrowing freely from  early talmudic studies, and other esoteric fields. I was quite charmed by  his ability to keep the long-haired kings straight, enchanted with his  particular use of the Knights Templar, and enraptured with his candidate  for King of the World. The antique romanticism of bringing in the Bonny  Prince was an elegant flourish, along the lines of &quot;top this!&quot; We  have all the wishful thinking of the field brought into one book, and it  was lovely.<br />The clue to the fact that this is satire should have been  just that - it was too perfect.<br />Note this book's smooth style, and its  rather beautiful prose. Compare it to so many others, especially the  Leigh-Baigent industry, and you will see the difference. I speculate that  this is an academic joke, gotten well out of hand.<br />I have to admit,  though, that it is a beautiful satire. The best thing about it is that so  many people who will credit almost any piece of silliness, provided the  Church of Rome suffers, have subscribed to it.<br />As an aside, all of you  need to go back and read Umberto Eco's Foucalt's Pendulum.though, that it is a beautiful satire. The best thing about it is that so  many people who will credit almost any piece of silliness, provided the  Church of Rome suffers, have subscribed to it.<br />As an aside, all of you  need to go back and read Umberto Eco's Foucalt's Pendulum.	2000-08-29

They're worth an hour  or two, and (if you are a public transit commuter) they will distract you  from the morning's disasters, your train's immobility, and motion sickness.  <br />This wasn't bad. It dates itself badly, sometimes, and it's rather  conventional, but the stories move right along, and there is some good fun.  I had some problems with Telzey's ethics. It so happens that I view all  psychic powers with a jaundiced eye, and tend not to feel as sympathetic as  I should to a telepathic character. And the end of the first story had me  ready to kick the little monster out a high window. Sorry, fans of the  author, but it's truly amazing what the glow of nostalgia will do for a  book. <br />Things that really jump up and down? Well, this is set some 1500  years in the future, and boy, these folks are just like us. No genetic  manipulation, except on the part of the bad guys in Lion Game, and the  technology feels - well, weak, when you consider wheat can be done even  now. People 1500 years ago - 500 A.D. if you can't do math - weren't much  like us. <br />Telzey and her milieu aren't a problem, really. Accept that  Shmitz was writing to sell, and that means write adventure. I don't have a  real problem, but it certainly detracts from the rating.<br />The real problem  is that, even if Telzey is a genius, as we are told in the very first few  bits of Novice, a fifteen going on sixteen year old girl is hardly going to  have the skills of a veteran of the shadow wars. Telzey behaves like a  veteran when she isn't one. I don't care how bright she is. This kept  bringing me out of the book and the mood. That makes this only a minor  book, and, by the evidence so far presented, Shmitz only a minor writer.  <br />One real jolt - time passeth! - was that a positive character lit up a  cigarette, and it wasn't an unfortunate weakness! It was a casual mention!  Wow! That was a shocker for me, and had me marveling over it for a couple  days. <br />There's nothing wrong with this. Read it, have a good time. Then  sell it. It's not really worth keeping after you're done with it.	2000-08-11

Leary, Commanding	Books	3	15	17	N	Y	A Whiff of Nelson &amp; Ceasar &amp; Well, You Name It	I hope I can keep up the standard of the other reviewers, all three of  whom were clear and concise. <br />This is a good space opera. It's also an  interesting combination of the aftermath of the Cataline Conspiracy, Ceasar  (guys, this author knows Rome), Nelson's navy (note the requirements for  advancement, and the majority of details of ship handling), and (as Drake  openly warns us) a quick slice of American naval history. <br />First of all,  let's get to the bare bones assessment:<br />Buy it, and enjoy. I can't say  you'll keep it, especially if your bookcases are in the state mine are, but  it's worth your money in hardbound.<br />Now the discussion of why I think  this:<br />The relationship between Leary and my favorite viewpoint character,  Adele Mundy, is very good. A portrayal of an unlikely friendship that  benefits both sides, one personality analyzing it, the other simply pleased  to have it, is great. Also, Drake gets to use Adele to explain the Navy  through Leary's lectures, and Adele to explain politics. <br />No one has yet  touched on that part of it, and it's important. Adele Mundy may be a touch  morbid, but with the history we're shown, she should be. The detachment,  the precision, and the ability to empty herself of emotion, or at least  treat emotion just as another factor, not be overwhelmed by it (except with  regard to the house, and three cheers for her attack on the parvenu  vulgarity she tosses out), is an excellent examination of the requirements  to survive a (how shall I put this?) coup of naked force. Compare Adele to  the character of Vaughn. They have very different interests, granted. But  which of them would you want beside you?<br />Drake always delivers on the  action. This time, without being heavy handed (a sin of his in some other  books), he handles historical politics with imagination and flair.<br />The  other reviewers are right. Read &quot;With the Lightnings&quot; first.  There are too many references back to that book for this to stand on its  own. This is one of the few times when I can honestly say, though, that the  sequel is better than the first book.	2000-08-11

The obvious ones, like the two versions of the  creation, bothered me less since it was understood that the stories in  Genesis were allegories, stories, myths, and important more for their  poetry and as set-up for the rest of the story of humankind. Then there was  the way that, in the first five books and right through Joshua and Judges,  people kept rejoicing in slaughter. Never mind my puzzlement as I learned  more about history. The Epistles never felt consistent to me. <br />Fox is a  specialist, and I'm not. He gives the reader all the material he or she  needs to understand why all those things bother them. You may have Herod,  or Cyrinius. You cannot have both. And so on. <br />This isn't the book to  hand to a fundamentalist; all you'll do is offend. The examination of texts  and where things came from is great for those with no belief to lose. And  (to be quite honest) it's a relief to discover that the Hebrews didn't  actually massacre the inhabitants of Canaan.<br />All in all, I recommend this  book.	2000-08-10

The scholarship is the just-so stories sort. The tone towards  everyone but the masons is sneering, and assigns only the lowest of motives  to anyone not a mason.  <br />At first, I was making loud &quot;argh!&quot;  noises. Then, I realized just how bad it was, and started laughing.<br />I'm  not going to detail everything that's wrong with this particular book.  There's just too much. The archeology stinks. The authors haven't the  faintest conception of history. And, oh, joy, they throw the Templars in.  There is a picture of something the authors claim is a carving, at Rosslyn,  of corn. Well, it looked an awful lot like an aloe to me.<br />Umberto Eco got  it right. The Templars are related to everything. When you're seeing occult  masters behind everything.<br />I howled, hooted and probably frightened my  neighbors when I got to the explanation of the Turin Shroud. I won't spoil  it for you if you haven't read it, but it's really funny.<br />Now, this  particular field, silly literature, can be taken seriously only by people  who want conspiracies everywhere. If, on the other hand, you are something  like rational, this is funny. A good time is had by all, it's to be  fervently hoped. <br />If you are an afficianado of the field, jump right in.

Trust me. Unless you are an afficiado of the field, or wanting to be convinced of the Turin Shroud's authenticity (or at least the suspicion thereof), buy this in paper, or not at all.<br />That said, it could always be worse; Wilson  actually admits that there might be some doubt about the age of the Turin  Shroud. He scants the evidence against the shroud; he calumniates (gently,  by the standards of the genre) anyone who might call said shroud's  authenticity into question, and tip-toes through the minefield of alternate  explanations. <br />Wilson tries to paint our hypothetical forger as almost  superhuman. No, he wasn't. Nor was this person necessarily laughing up his  sleeve at everyone else. He (I'm saying he for convenience) wasn't like us,  and I'll thank people to remember it. The forger was an artist. He may even  have approached his task reverently, seeing himself as inspired. A medieval  forger wasn't like us, and he didn't think like us.<br />Leaving aside the  science, of which so much is disputed that I honestly say it all has to be  put aside except the radiocarbon dating (don't write me about the burning,  that's a fallacy and you ought to know it), I will comment on only one  historical point: the artist didn't use the &quot;Christmas cracker&quot;  grave wrapping for the simple reason that it's inaesthetic. Don't forget,  the medieval man had as sharp a sense of the ridiculous as you or I do.  Picture, if you will, Jesus, freshly resurected, shuffling, hopping and  writhing to get himself out of the tied-up parcel of medieval  grave-clothes, and the graceful 14-foot long shroud becomes immensely more  attractive.	2000-06-13

There are also &quot;Meanwhile, back at the  ranch&quot; passages that are ok, though I have some objections to Matt's  parents. The writing, as always with Stasheff, is neat and clean. <br />This  book didn't happen to have the one great laugh line he usually manages to  pack into his books, just a couple snickers. Overall, not great, but  readable. It's not the book to give a new Stasheff reader. If you are a  regular reader...<br />Stick a fork in it, it's done already.<br />Stasheff rides  a concept until long after it has gone to its eternal reward. He did it  with the Warlock in Spite of Himself books, and he's doing it here. The  plot line is identical to the last three or so, with an identical didactic  purpose. By now it is established that being faithful to one's marriage is  a good thing, and casual sex is bad. Fine. What I know about Zoroastrian  belief and worship is reasonably extensive, and he doesn't do violence to  it. Fine. But, god save us, get us a new plot, and take another  tack.<br />Also, this universe has become a course (lightly done) on  comparative religion. It will work well enough for a teenager, since  Stasheff can never be accused of bad writing. <br />However, when I want a  course on religion, I will go take one.	2000-06-08

When I started it, I thought, &quot;Now, I have read about these characters before, haven't I?&quot; And yep, I had. I didn't remember  them off-hand, though things came back.<br />The trouble is, this book is  going to slip my mind by next week. <br />This is competently done, decently  plotted, and the characters are both fairly likeable and fairly  interesting. But these guys are interchangeable with any other group of  characters from any number of novels.<br />That nest of adverbial phrases  covers it. My feeling about this is ambiguous. There is absolutely nothing  wrong with this book. But it's a good thing that it's in paperback, or I'd  be feeling cheated right now, and probably annoyed.<br />Feel free to buy it.

It pushed a lot of buttons, and it's surprising to me that it hasn't pushed a lot more. It's not as jump up and down on your sensibilities disturbing as the Koskuisko books, no. The  subject matter, though, is just as harsh. This book is excellent, and worth  pressing on anyone having a struggle with the notion of the  divine.<br />Avalanche Soldier doesn't feel as involved as the Andrej  Koskuisku (I apologize if I've murdered the spelling) books. On the other  hand, I was really impressed.<br />Religion is not an easy subject to even  begin to touch. Salli's experience of conversion and faith is powerful and  convincing. As someone who chases the ghost of faith around the kitchen  table now and again, and has some fairly strict theological notions (and  you just try fitting that into one head on one night!), watching Salli deal  with both faith and doubt in the context of a divided and stratified  society was fascinating.<br />Salli, the viewpoint character is  straightforward. Maybe a little unsubtle, and just sketched in on some  levels. Yet I found her experience of faith convincing and powerful. The  final decision she makes is tearing, and (emphasis) it's the right  one.<br />The only real quibble with this was the cop-out, of Varrick  declaring herself to be &quot;just another teacher.&quot; The denoument  would have been stronger without it, and also, from where I'm sitting, it  felt like a pro-active ducking of the more doctrinaire believers.<br />This  is worth your money.	2000-06-08

I thoroughly enjoyed this, and I was impressed when Sherman actually had Denise reciting a real Mesopotamian prayer. <br />The initial  demon-worshipping villains made perfect sense to me - there are lots and  lots of inadequate people out there dreaming of power from nowhere. There  is a problem, at least to me, with the notion of &quot;dark elves,&quot;  but that's because I've decided that elves, dark, light, hangin' out in LA,  NYC, or fairyland, are getting old.<br />Why the 3 star review? Because I  liked it, and I will buy a sequel without hesitation, but I only liked it.  We are guilty, here, of review inflation. Was this Lord of the Rings? No?  Then don't give it a five. This was fun, it was adequate, and I don't  regret buying it, or reading it, or recommending it. What I want to make  clear is that it isn't profound, or life changing. <br />Another thing - part  of me wants a sequel. But if Josepha Sherman decides to leave Ilaron and  Denise right where they are, that's fine, too.

The first two were unalloyed pleasure for me, and  the third was pretty good. My problems have everything to do with what I'm  beginning to classify as Eric Flint's verbal tics. I didn't before, because  I hadn't enough acquaintance with his work to say. While David Drake has a  certain grim, economical style of his own, Flint writes like a high school  history teacher should speak, with both the enthusiasm and the weaknesses  implied by that. <br />He is engaged with his material, he enjoys showing us  how these people in the past, who were just as smart as we are, did things.  He does fail on the same point that I've never really been able to get  across to young people: they weren't like us. I'd put that in caps, except  that I don't approve of shouting. <br />Furthermore, I noted this in Flint's  1632, I'm getting tired of certain characteristic phrases, like &quot;mind  you,&quot; and habits like, &quot;tense. Tense. Tense.&quot; &quot;Bad, bad  move.&quot; And so on. In one character's mental voice, I could abide it.  But have mercy! At least once a chapter, the thrice-repeated word? I  started muttering, &quot;And what I tell you three times is true.&quot;  <br />Another verbal tic, and whose fault this is, I don't know, but the word  &quot;huge&quot; must be excised from somebody's vocabulary. Using the  adjective huge twice in one paragraph? Oh, dear. I am officially declaring  this to be a dead word.<br />Perhaps it's simply the fact that I know that a  complex series of maneuvers is going to lead to triumph for Belisarius, but  the book just felt too predictable, and the neat details of armament,  animal handling, and technology weren't there this time. Nor did the  territory covered feel more than sketched in. <br />Yeah, I liked it. Yeah, I  don't feel cheated. But I'd love to see the writers pay a little more  attention in the next book, or I will feel disappointed.	2000-05-25

I have an elephant's memory, and generally don't have trouble remembering who did what to whom when. In this particular case, though,  read the several page plot summary. Really.<br />Cherryh does love baroque  plots. This one, though, verges on roccoco. <br />When a character thinks  about a situation or circumstance, they don't think just of the surface.  The character thinks of iterations and implications and alternatives and  ... you get the idea? Read the summary, even if you've read all three  previous books.<br />The book itself is excellent. The prose is nice and  clean, the book moves along at a great pace, while not over-running itself.  In the past few books she's published, Cherryh has managed to overcome her  tendency to lose the reader in the last couple chapters with unclear  action. Yeah, the denoument involves a lot of fast moves, sometimes moving  contrary to each other, but you're clear on who's doing what.<br />There is  one persistent fault of diction I have noted consistently through the past  few books. For some reason, Cherryh or her proof-reader is using  &quot;principle&quot; for &quot;principal.&quot; Small, but if you notice  it once, you keep noticing it.<br />Good book, good series, but read the plot  summary.	2000-05-09
US	52691218	R3TBTOPS1K1T73	0451457803	201826021	On the Oceans of Eternity	Books	3	2	2	N	Y	Very Satisfying! And No Impalements!	Stirling did a bang-up job with this trilogy. From first to last, he kept everybody consistent even while they changed over the 11 year span. He kept a modicum of control over sprawling material. There are still too many  threads to catch at once (it's the whole bronze age world!), but he limits  what he narrates, and hews close to an exciting story-line.<br />If you don't  like political maneuver, and the continuation of diplomacy by other means,  you may not care for this book. I had a great time. Stirling seems to know  his stuff, and carries his story along at a good, solid pace. Not too much  hurry, not too much detail.  <br />It has been evident from the first book  that Stirling had a definite plan for these books, and he's stuck to it. I  felt in the first book that he padded it a little, and even more in the  second book. I realize now that this was actually set-up, and I apologize  in retrospect. This book, even though over 500 pages of small type, was  really satisfying. <br />Without giving the plot away, which tends to annoy  me, I will say this: there is a beautifully done distinction between people  who are doing the best they can and the truly evil. There are good  character sketches; Stirling understands (evidently) that you don't have to  detail every little mole a character who isn't a main viewpoint has.  <br />While he left lots of room for sequels, Stirling ended the trilogy well.  The bad guys get their come-uppance. The good guys get their rewards. This  is expected, but it's done well. <br />What's more, though he mentions  crucifixions (yuck!), Stirling doesn't go into much detail about it, and he  restrained his intellectual brutality to a bearable level. This has been a  consistent problem for me with Stirling. I am happy to see it kept under  strict control.<br />There are few typos or grammatical errors. Stirling  appears to have done more than a first pass with a spell-checker. <br />Lots  of fun. Read it.	2000-04-17

I read this back in November and didn't even mind a really long commuter train delay. My neighbors may have, although most of them seemed to smile as I snickered, giggled and guffawed my way through it. When I went home for Christmas, I pressed it on my mother, and, when she complained that her  eyes hurt too much for the tiny print, I read parts of it aloud.  Fortunately, my mother shares my sense of humor.<br />I think this is the  funniest of Pratchett's books. To be sure, someone else can disagree, and  that's not a bad thing. Pratchett's eye for the ridiculous is sharp, but he  stays reasonably charitable which makes a nice change. Best of all,  Pratchett never forgets that a satire works best if it has a story of its  own to hang on. That's a point all too often forgotten by people who think  they're writing satire.<br />Just because I can't resist, I'll hint at my  favorite passage: &quot;IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE SAFE.&quot; If you haven't  already read the book, that's the point where I couldn't stop laughing, and  never mind that one lady looked quite ready to summon the security  people!<br />Like Gibbon, Pratchett lives a good deal of his life in his  footnotes, acerbic enough to appeal to my somewhat jaundiced view of  humanity. He thinks a lot of people are idiots, and it's a good thing the  world has got so well padded. For some, it could get even better  padded...<br />Christmas, even crass and commercialized, is a good thing, and  Pratchett remembers that. This book is great.	2000-04-11

Yes. Weber's style, plotting and characterization have improved markedly -- I went back  and re-read Basilisk Station just to check that impression, and yep, lots  of improvement. We don't see as much of Honor as I might have liked, and in  his concentration on showing us the politics and social forces and intrigue  of the universe he's building, he scanted a couple things I would have  liked to see. His Hornblower and Nelson references are getting just a  little thick on the ground: &quot;Now some say Nelson had one eye/while  others say he had one arm/But you'd have to ask Lady Hamilton/if the rest  of his features suffered harm!&quot; Ahem.<br />On the other hand, he followed  up nicely on a couple points: two books ago, Sir Thomas Caparelli noted  that Harrington taught well. It was good of Weber to follow that up, and I  gripe that I would have liked to see more of it displayed.<br />A serious  gripe is that I think the treecat business is getting a little too cute.  The latest touches aren't thrilling me.<br />Weber is doing nicely with his  French Revolution and Stalinist purge elements. I like his unflinching  willingness to kill off important characters (although I wish he wouldn't  do it off-stage!) in service to the plot.<br />Ashes of Victory expands the  universe, and, while I'm sorry to see the focus fading from Honor, I  respect his effort. Ursula K. LeGuin remarked in an essay that fiction,  even (and perhaps especially) science fiction, is not prescriptive, but  descriptive. If Weber's nerve holds, and his confidence in his imagination  doesn't get inflated, he's got an interesting premise to work with. <br />I  say go for it! Expand this universe, with Honor just one more viewpoint  character, and I'll be happy.	2000-03-30

He has some understanding of history and the fact that people in the past were as smart as we are. Better, he recognizes, and emphasizes, that just because someone is illiterate doesn't mean that  person is stupid. <br />Flint does tend to write in editorial voice, and I  don't mind that. There's a feeling of &quot;summing up&quot; and it gives  away who's going to make it and who isn't, which reduces plot tension.  There are times when I get a little tired of his italicized remarks. I may  notice it since I read 1632 at one gulp. Mind candy for me, and a chance to  notice things that, had I read it with breaks I might not have cared  about.<br />Gustavus Adolphus is all too often overlooked by people who don't  study military history, and he shouldn't be. My admiration for the man is a  little more reserved that Flint's, but hey. This is a messy period and  anyone who studies it is going to have different views of who was great and  why.<br />I can't, and won't, dispute Flint about Jewish history. I only have  the outlines, there. But, and this is a serious complaint, he  over-emphasizes the Inquisition in the Germanies during the 30 Years' War,  and what they were looking for. Washing too much leading to suspicion of  being a hidden Jew? Er...well, the fastest and easiest way to end up burned  at the stake was to get caught in a witch-hunt, and there were lots of  those. They were as much Protestant as Catholic, and just as gruesome.  Curiously, two European countries got off rather lightly on the witchcraft  hysteria -- Italy and Spain. I guess there's only room for one sort of  hysteria at a time.<br />I had fun with this; the grammar didn't drive me  nuts; and the manuscript has been proofread. If Flint can find it in his  heart to ease up on the editorial give-aways, I'd be pleased, but he's the  writer. It won't prevent me from buying his books and giving them an ok.	2000-03-30

I've pressed him on practically anyone I can convince to hold still for five minutes, and I did like this one. Sam Vimes has evolved nicely during each appearance, and Pratchett can  be both pointed and convulsively funny at the same time. The Fifth Elephant  romps along, a giggle guaranteed every five minutes or so, and some fun at  the expense of &quot;romantic&quot; werewolves and vampires. If you don't  like people staring at you on public transportation, don't read this during  your commute. <br />The problem I had was the really awful proofreading job.  The same thing happened with Carpe Jugulum, and it bothered me a lot. Over  the years I've made myself tolerant of homonyms and tense problems. I've  even come to bear the abominable use of apostrophes. I'll let the  occasional I/me and its/it's error slide, though I tend to grit my teeth  while doing so. But this was awful; sentences begun with obvious typos,  mis-spelling that should have been caught by a first pass with a  spell-checker and so on. <br />I only gave The Fifth Elephant three stars  because the errors distracted me and got on my nerves. This doesn't mean  that I don't like Pratchett, it means that I feel authors and their  publishers should be reproved for that kind of thing.	2000-03-27

When she is really on, she is a past mistress of pace.<br />In this book, the tension begins on the first page and builds from there. There are  no holes in the plot, it is tight and it is fast. Better than most writers,  Cherryh writes well about very bright people under pressure. More than  that, Bren is portrayed (very well!) as someone who thinks clearly and fast  under pressure.<br />In so far as I have a problem with Cherryh, it is her  tendency to lose me in the action at the very end. This time, I didn't get  lost, and I was pleased with that.<br />The interplay of Bren's family  situation and his job when it gets tense is well done.<br />Another thing I  appreciate about Cherryh is that she seems to proofread, and have a decent  grasp of basic grammar. She remembers usage things that many other authors  either never learned or simply don't bother to observe. Sometimes this is  unintentionally funny, but I find it annoying.<br />Cherryh, perhaps  deliberately and perhaps not, comes down on the side of the free market.  People will work out how to make new ideas work for them, so get out of the  way. If you have a problem with this belief system, you may not be too  happy.<br />Once, in the Faded Sun books, she pointed out that we have, among  ourselves, surrendered one member of a society (at least the West has) to  an alien one, so that we have a translator. The position that Bren is in is  emphatically that.<br />The pace is good, the under-text is fascinating, no  preaching, and good writing. Go out and buy it.	2000-01-27

If you know Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake already, you don't need to read this review. If you like Anita's style, you'll like this. The action moves right along; the tension stays high; the pov is steady. It's always Anita's  voice and thoughts. The bad guys are really nasty, the crimes awful, and  the carnage (if you don't mind carnage) satisfying. <br />There are a few  caveats, and some of them are my problems, I suspect, not Hamilton's. But  here they are. <br />First, while she writes violence extraordinarily well,  she doesn't write the people committing it all that well. Part of that is  the limitation of first person narration. You only have her view, and Anita  isn't that profound an observer. <br />Second, the climax goes on long enough  that I began saying, &quot;Come on, get on with it, will you?&quot; Not  long enough that I began yelling it, granted (which I did with The Killing  Dance), but that bothered me. <br />Third, and this is personal and  persnickety, Laurell Hamilton has a persistent I/me error. This is not a  major fault, and it sure didn't keep me from reading the book, but it was  there, and every time, I stopped and muttered, &quot;For heaven's sake,  figure it out!&quot; This may be a characterization thing -- that is, the  error is Anita's, but it bothered me to no end. Subject, I. Object, me.  <br />There were other things like that. Not enough to stop me reading, not  enough to ruin it, but enough to distract me. Enough to break the flow of  the story for me, and that's not good.<br />Overall, though, this is a nice  ride. You won't be wasting your money or time.	2000-01-25

By this time, I would expect some improvement, but no-o-o! Not these folks!<br />Not only is the writing just as  wooden, just as scarily unconnected, now there are active contradictions.  Not minor stuff, either. Steele's wife's name. Behavior. Actions. <br />Look,  characterization isn't that hard. Neither is writing emotions that convince  the reader. These people don't experience faith, or fear, or any other  feeling. We're told about it. <br />Spare me! Stop writing this stuff! Or  write better, one or the other. I know you can sell millions of these  awful, thinly-plotted, badly characterized screeds because believers have  far too little to read that entertains, enlightens and instructs. But  please, work harder! And you readers! Just because it's about Christians  facing the apocolypse doesn't mean it's any good.

Flint has an engaging style, even if he does condescend just  a little. The situation is pretty typical SF, the main change being one of  era -- these days, we're all for ethical treatment of and alliance with the  natives rather than carving out a slice of territory and going out  conquering from there. The way Flint ties his human colony into dependence  is truly wonderful. I still regard this as being a matter of contemporary  cultural fashion, but it's not one that I mind.<br />This book is a pleasure.  There isn't a dull moment in the whole thing. But...<br />There's always a  but. Eric Flint, most unfairly, hints at future events creating legends.  Ok, where's the book?<br />As someone who kept being told that nothing I  studied had any possible relevance to the real world, I couldn't help but  rejoice to see the historian actually holding the keys.<br />Long live the  Ivory Tower!	1999-09-22

This isn't the book to introduce Miles to your friends who haven't already met him. This book is neither Brothers in Arms or Memory, the two  best books in the series. But it is very, very good. <br />I especially liked  the fact that she has finally taken the time to show that the one thing you  really don't want to do is engage Ivan. Once, through Miles' viewpoint, the  remark was made about his having a sharp but lazy mind. Well, once you stub  your toe on his sense of right and wrong, he becomes as bad a person to  cross as Miles himself. <br />I'm waiting for a book about Ivan.<br />Recently, I  read a review which remarked that the purpose of a novel has usually been  to bring two young people to the altar. Here we are. Miles and Ekaterin are  going to marry; Gregor and Laisa are married, Duv Galeni and (god help us)  Team Koudelka are married off. Let's see what can be done with Ivan.<br />I've  always liked and sympathized with Ivan. I adore Miles, and I would actually  allow myself to be locked up with him for a week. Which is why I keep  re-reading all these books. But let's see what can be done with poor Ivan,  and who is he going to marry?<br />Loved it, just admitted it wasn't Memory.	1999-09-16

The cheerful abandon with which he wipes out the human race tends to make for a great story. But this time, he forgot who his characters were. How could someone like Kaye just  leave science? There would be somewhere in the world where she would be  safe -- Innsbruck, anybody? -- and her husband and baby as well. Hiding out  in Arizona? Her husband working at a car dealership? Oh, please. <br />I kept  getting the feeling that Bear would be working with an idea about character  development, and then abandon it, and us (the readers) with a thump.  Characters you think are going to be of continuing significance simply drop  out. No further mention. I was confused, and more than a little annoyed,  considering that I leapt on this like a famished wolf. <br />I'm sure there is  a perfectly good explanation for the way this book is written. But  still...<br />Most of all, I can't imagine someone who is at the top, the very  top, of her field simply abandoning science. Could Agassi abandon tennis,  even for a happy marriage? No. You can't get there without being, at some  level, intensely selfish, and I can't see her just shrugging and walking  away. And I wouldn't care to see what would happen once Kaye really formed  a determination to fight back. Never, ever convince a really, really smart  person they need to fight back. You won't like the result. <br />That didn't  happen in this book, and I was more than disappointed. Sorry. It did  satisfy my insomniac's restlessness last night. It helped with the BART  ride this morning, and that's fine. But I've finished it, and I'm not  happy.<br />Sorry, I was just so disappointed with what he did with his main  characters.	1999-09-16

What's more, this novel wanders all over the place. Ok, Zettle went from unknown to famous. The publisher said, &quot;You can have a hardbound if you give us  so many pages.&quot; Then, god help us, we were saddled with this.  <br />Someone commented on the really pointless descriptions of clothing and  so on. It's worse than that. The first person to actually believe anyone  would be stupid enough to allow the takeover of one of the space stations  gets a medal. The supposed moral dilemmas annoyed me by their shallowness.  The &quot;plague&quot; annoyed me worse. We are shown a human society that  is extremely advanced, technologically, and it can't solve the plague in  five minutes? Zettel's hand-waving on that one irritated me beyond measure.  The text was also sloppily proofed -- I actually extracted my red pencil  and started ticking and fixing the errors. I can't believe a published  author would allow the multiple cases of the wrong &quot;its&quot; to get  through, or that a publisher would send it to press in that state, but they  did.<br />The biggest problem is, I actually liked both Reclamation and Fool's  War. This novel should have been half the length it was, and better thought  out. <br />Yeah, I'm ticked. I paid hardback price for this, and I should have  waited.

My problem was that I had this little nagging voice saying: &quot;Yes, but it's Rome,&quot; and  wanting to know how it is that a social situation so very similar could  possibly exist, except by the writers getting singularly lazy.   Note,  also, that there was some sloppiness in the plotting, too. Nothing major,  just I would have liked to see a little more detail of the thought  processes involved in planning Adrian's approaches to problems. In the  General, which I enjoyed immensely, or in the Chosen (ditto), the sense of  depth was better, and I felt that the control over the material (never mind  that it was perfectly recognizeable to anyone who stayed awake through both  Western Civ courses) was better. I liked it, damnit. I always do, even when  I'm bugged by parts of it. Whenever Drake gets into Rome, I know I'm in for  a great ride that won't make me say, &quot;Er.., but didn't such-and-such  happen...&quot; God knows, it's great fun to see history played with. But a  society this parallel doesn't feel credible to me.  Sorry, I liked it, but  I can't give it a higher rating than I did.	1999-04-19

It makes  me sick to think that someone, somewhere, is going to compare this book to  Susan Matthew's books, and thereby send some poor soul, completely revolted  by this trash, away from some seriously good books.<br />Please, if you  haven't attempted this book, or any of this person's others, don't.  I  started out bored and slightly revulsed.  I finished so revolted and  sickened that I cannot even contemplate buying anything else by this  author.<br />Enough said, and probably more than anyone wants to hear.	1998-08-17
US	52691218	R37RUBNZJ6MYP9	0553577034	904046711	Dreaming in Smoke	Books	3	2	2	N	Y	It's Entertainment	The colonization project didn't get off to a great start, and now Kalypso  (our heroine) is about to get bitten by the secrets her elders have been  keeping.<br />Dreaming in Smoke served to occupy a few hours, but I have to  say, it wasn't good enough to recommend.  I never was much of a fan of  stream of consciousness, particularly since I never have believed the  character's stream.  Kalypso is annoying.  The whole colony could  suffocate, and I really, really wouldn't care.  There is a happy ending,  yes, and that's nice. I'm not a believer in killing everybody just for  effect.  But it would have made it more interesting.<br />I was uncomfortable  with some of the science, as I'm almost sure there were some howlers I'd  have caught if I paid the slightest attention in highschool biology, or  taken chemistry.  Ah, well.<br />So, don't rush out and spend your money on  this one.  It's okay, you won't be outraged, but look for it, if you decide  you want to read it, in your local second hand bookstore.	1998-08-17
US	52691218	R3LLNZ8X8M0MGV	031286163X	412077931	Earthquake Weather	Books	5	1	1	N	N	It's Averaging only 3 1/2 Stars?!?	Ok, to read Earthquake Weather, it helps to have 1) read Last Call and  Expiration Date; 2) a pretty thorough acquaintance with magic and esoteric  societies of the last couple centuries; and 3) taken Crank Lit 101. <br />On  the other hand, if you've done none of the above, read it anyway.  None of  what Powers is telling you is incidental, or just showing off.  Pay  attention!  If he tells you about Mammy Pleasants, it's for a reason.  What's more, he usually gets it right.  Each of these references makes the  story deeper; none of it is just to show off.<br />I discovered Powers back in  the early '80s, which means I'm not one of the early true believers, but  I've gotten every single thing he's written and kept it, even when it's had  to be taped back together.  Maybe Earthquake Weather isn't the hottest  thing; maybe his characterizations are not that believable, but who cares?  Just get out there and buy all his books, including Earthquake.  You will  not regret it.	1998-08-17

Banks is getting reviewed here	I have decided that I love Banks.  <br />The only thing that makes me squirm  in his books, ever, is his insistence on giving the main character a flaw  that always strikes me as inconsequential, and demeaning to the story.<br />If  he has a fondness for a planned society, or harbors sympathy for a  &quot;socialist&quot; economy, he has my deepest regrets.  The day will  come when everyone is so wealthy that money won't matter any more.  But we  won't get there by &quot;redistributing&quot; wealth.<br />I loved The Player  of Games, from the first page to the very last. The only book I've liked  better is Fearsum Enjinn, however startling the dyslexic narrator happened  to be.	1998-08-17
US	52691218	R137K357Y3FZN8	0441001289	729191984	Nobody's Son	Books	4	3	3	N	N	For once, magic isn't a cop-out	I don't like to review books on which everybody and their uncle has  already commented, so, although I read this one ages ago, here we are. Sean  Stewart does a good job with &quot;happily ever after&quot;, and (as an  aside) pays real attention to when peasants get married.  The magic in this  one is scary, depressing and violent.  The hero has to work hard, and  endure real misery, to gain any kind of control of it.  I recommend  practically anything of Stewart's; this is good, but it's not disturbing,  like Passion Play. Good &quot;lazy summer afternood&quot; read.	1998-08-12
US	52691218	R2IB55XZPGOL2A	0380789140	716268031	Prisoner of Conscience	Books	5	2	2	N	N	He's mad enough to be honorable; read it, read it, read it.	I've read both of these books, and I want more, but I have a strong, strong warning:  Don't try to read this late.  You'll have nightmares.  At least I did.<br />The subject matter is repulsive.  Torture, mass murder (or attempted genocide), the slow destruction of a man and his honor.  Ugh.<br />But I couldn't put it down, and I can't recommend it highly enough.  I just can't drop it, or the images it leaves me with.  Imagine the gulag and the worst of the Nazi extermination camps, combined.  Imagine a man whose accomodation to the worst thing he can do is to flip some mental switch, and taps into that place of dark, bloody, unacceptable erotocism that (I suspect, anyway) most men have inside them.<br />He is mad.  No one can accomodate the rigid code of Andrej's upbringing, the ethics of a healer, and the inappropriate enjoyment of his work without being quite, quite mad.  But his honor remains, because he is mad, it becomes the one true thing left him.  When he betrays it, by torturing one of his security, the backlash shakes him.  It also makes it possible for him to see past his psychotic pleasure, to the fact that something is rotten.<br />I couldn't put it down. It gave me nightmares.  I'll read the next one. Buy it, read it.	1998-06-11

I rather wonder if LH can keep going, without making Anita into a human monster.  So far, she is able to stop, to let someone see she is willing to kill, so he or she can back down from the challenge.  <br />Personally, I think her relationship with Jean-Claude will be her salvation; the situation with Richard can't be resolved, given who Anita is becoming.  I want to see how the next one is handled.<br />And where's Edward when you need him?	1998-06-03
US	52691218	R3QNWOBWX1Z3R9	0671878735	904025755	The War God's Own	Books	4	1	1	N	N	It's a light-weight	Well, here we are, all waiting for a new Honor Harrington, but to slake our burning thirst, we'll take anything by David Weber.  So we get this one, in hard-bound, and down it in one gulp.<br />But, what's this?  An unsatisfied feeling about the tummy?  Yep. <br />It's not actively bad - even Heirs of Empire wasn't really bad - but whenever gods get into it, your main character has a really, really bad tendency to become, well, boring.  You know, in this one, exactly what's coming.  All the fun rests on seeing how the author handles the expected heroism.<br />Weber is not the world's greatest at characterization.  He's not the greatest writer I've ever read.  But he does keep the story going, and I get a kick out of his books.  This one was just, well, lightweight.  <br />On the other hand, I'll still buy anything he puts out, in hardbound, and down it at one gulp.	1998-06-03
US	52691218	R3M72WW7NJK8HK	0671878778	348946541	Komarr : A Miles Vorkosigan Adventure	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Miles is getting married!	It wasn't Memory, but it's better than The Vor Game.<br />The problem is a nasty one, and the clues don't arrive easily, although Bujold did kind of telegraph one (if you haven't read it, I'll not spoil your fun).  I liked one thing greatly:  she let us see Miles from the outside for once. Miles' internal dialogue has been known to cause me to fall out of bed, or to whoop aloud while on public transportation during rush hour (I strongly recommend reading Bujold in private.  I've really embarrassed myself a few times).  It was great to see an outside view of Miles, and see why he seems so overwhelming.  <br />I have a very few quibbles, and they are just that, quibbles.<br />This particular book doesn't feel as dense as the last couple have.  I felt, also, that the book was a little stiff. Ekatrin didn't seem the kind of woman, even given Barrayar's social mores, who would tolerate her marriage, even for her child's sake.	1998-06-03
US	52691218	R33YF7AENHKX80	0451456750	739185427	Island in the Sea of Time	Books	4	5	7	N	N	No one gets impaled in the first chapter	I tend to approach S.M. Sterling's books with some caution.  There are levels of brutality, and Sterling hits me with an intellectual brutality that is actively painful.  But this one!  I had a great deal of fun, and enjoyed the sense of &quot;Ok, folks, we're stuck.  Now pull up your socks and get on with it.&quot;<br />I must respond to one other review - sometimes, stupidity is deadly, and ought to be.  Many of the characters cope with the reality of their situations, others retreat into fantasy, just as people do, when faced with trouble.  There were coincidences, yes, but I know that sometimes, things just happen to go your way.  A few coincidences are excusable, if they keep the book moving.<br />I liked the removal of guns, and the recognition of living on top of a technological pyramid.  The ingenuity of the people of Nantucket in working out stop-gaps and substitutes was great.<br />The bad guys are bad guys with depth. Some have great motives, but cause disaster; others are people who might be good people in harsher circumstances, but their insolence and unwillingness to bear authority make them villains.  I liked it.	1998-06-03
