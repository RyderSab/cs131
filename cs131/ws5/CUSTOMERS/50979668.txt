Briner, a top televison producer, puts forth his impassioned argument that Christians should involve themselves in every aspect of cultural life, presenting an alternative to the usual ways of the world. But by \\"alternative\\" he obviously means a particular Calvinist/fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity. That narrow view ultimately flaws his openness to culture and society.<br /><br />Briner specifically offers suggestions for Christian involvement in newspaper, sports, film, and television. It is particularly in these section that his theological bias shows. Enthusiastic commendations for Dr. James Dobson and Cal Turner, hardly exemplars of Christian charity and peace, indicate the kind of culture Briner would like to replace the present with. He also makes some unfortunate assumptions about existing cultural institutions such as PBS (educated people are the least likely to be affected by the gospel? Maybe your gospel, Bob). Briner also has a slight tendency to name drop; \\"when I was in a jet with Walter Cronkite...\\" is a minor flaw but a distraction from his premise.<br /><br />As a Christian seminary graduate and student of culture, I applaud Briner's encouragement of Christian artists, musicians, and journalist. I hope, however, that those Christians are not merely limited to Briner's interpretation of what the Gospel is. There are many gifts in the body of Christ, and many interpretations of what appropriate Christian art and music are. I encourage the church to embrace them all.	2005-07-08

Nafisi, a professor of English literature educated in the United States, returns to post-Shah Iran to find a different and dangerous world, where men and women can no longer shake hands, and the characters in novels are denounced as decadent and immoral. In defiance, Nafisi sets up a secret discussion circle to talk about the books most precious to her: Nabokov's Lolita, The Great Gatsby, William James, and Jane Austen. Literary criticism, the lives of the students, and Nafisi's own personal and philosophical struggles illustrate what happens when people of imagination live under the stifling weight of ideology gone violent.<br /><br />Nafisi's book isn't necessarily a page-turner. The sections criticism will seem abstract to anyone but hard-core literary theorists. Likewise, the skips between fact, fiction and theory can sometimes be hard to follow. The powerful images of people yearning to think freely overcome the shortcomings, however. Breeze through the stuff that doesn't maintain your interest, and linger over the portraits of women in love with learning. Let the anger against repression fuel your desire to teach beauty and freedom in your own life.	2004-08-13

Elie follows the lives of Trappist monk Thomas Merton, Southern outcast Flannery O'Connor, literary gentleman Walker Percy, and Christian radical Dorothy Day. Rather than strict biography, Elie follows each writer's life as a pilgrimage, seeing the progression of the country's history and American Catholicism along the details of their lives.<br /><br />For a book weighing in at 560 hefty pages, Elie provides a surprisingly quick read. He has an excellent ability to feel with each of his subject's quite different personalities. Elie also examines the strength and limitations of Catholics in America, the heart of a writer, and different ways to express one's faith in art and in life. Not only a read for critics or for Catholics, this is a wonderful bedtime book for anyone who wants to combine their love for God, for literature, and for the poor and outcasts of our world today.	2004-08-13

Schwartzentruber recalls his transition from a rural bilingual community in Ontario to the housing projects of St. Louis, his years in denominational leadership, and his personal involvement as the overseer of Germantown Mennonite Church. Schwartzentruber's emotional involvement in the lives of particular people intersect his strong commitment to confronting prejudice and discrimination in their various forms both within and beyond the church. Whether confronting racism in a St. Louis church, weeping openly during the removal of Germantown due to its position on accepting homosexual people into membership, or sharing his poetic wrestling with God, Schwartzentruber connects his life experiences with an awareness of God walking with him and with the poor and the oppressed. (From my review in Mennonite Quarterly Review, July 2003)<br />Especially pertinent are the author's clear commitment to God's call of social justice, especially as a challenge to racism and inclusion of gay and lesbian people in the church. His experience of God's love flowing through his congregations leads him to a radical inclusiveness that mirrors God's. Despite a generally amateur writing style, Schwartzentruber's experiences and passion compel readers to rethink what it truly means to be a Christian.	2003-08-05

Byatt's Babel Tower integrates one woman's complicated journey into the story of the troubled 1960's with masterful results. Frederica has married an upper-class gentleman who expects her to stay at home and take care of their child without exercising her intellectual gifts or being allowed to see her friends. When he turns violent, she flees with her son back to London and her artistic peer group. In her part-time job reading unsolicited manuscripts, she comes across a vibrant, disturbing book called Babbletower and recommends it for publishing. The rest of the novel deals with Frederica's divorce trial and the prosecution of the novel for obscenity. All of it is set, however, in the swirling, chaotic upset of the 1960's and the redefinition of an entire culture's values.<br />Byatt is a masterful fiction writer. The many voices of the novel - Frederica's, the fanatic recluse author's, the liberal clergyman's, even Anthony Burgess' - are rendered in believable and splendid detail. We believe them all, whether they repulse us or not. The surrounding culture mirrors Frederica's changing identity - reading the Hobbit to her son, short skirts, hash brownies, happenings. Excerpts of Babbletower indeed read like a work of subversive genius - and it's all created by Byatt. I believe the English have an edge on the subtle development of character and plot. Read this great one to know how it's done.	2003-07-02

The first section, \\"Darkness Like Dresses,\\" writes from the point of view of several Biblical or Biblically suggested women such as Eve, Goliath's wife, and Mary Magdalene. The second section, \\"An Alphabet of Psalms,\\" runs across the author's engagement with life in all of its gritty manifestations: first kisses, infertility, and the significance of a man's shoes. The last sections deal with the difficulty of language and religion.<br />Funk both deftly displays a grasp of vivid concrete imagery and a lack of fear about the difficult themes of life, including sexuality and religion. If you want to be challenged by a new poetic glimpse into women's lives, Head Full of Sun may fit the bill.	2003-06-16

Studying the book in its original context - remember, Revelation was written for the first century, not for us! - the authors still connect the concerns of John of Patmos' day to our own. They see Revelation's message of faithful resistance to the surrounding patriotic culture and how John warned the early Christians to resist it and preach the good news instead. And they uncover what the &quot;beast&quot; really is in modern society. A thoughtful and passionate understanding of this fantastic book's true message to both its time and our own.	2002-07-29

This is a novel entirely new, something not too common nowadays. The book recounts the story of a spiraling tattoo artist who stumbles across a handwritten manuscript. The manuscript, the product of a blind scholar, is a scholarly essay on a movie about a house that never ends. The house is a terrifying, inexplicable black monster that nobody can explain.<br />Confused? That's part of the delight of this book. Danielewski wraps his story with extended footnotes, innovative graphic design, and massive amounts of meticulously researched information. But most of all, IT'S CREEPY, in a way you never thought self-aware fiction could be. A must read for David Foster Wallace fans, people writing their doctoral dissertations on the Blair Witch project, and anyone else who views &quot;weird&quot; as the most positive adjective of all.	2002-07-29

Dorrien starts with the Unitarians (most notably Ralph Waldo Emerson -- did you remember he was a minister from high school?) and considers other forerunners such as Harriet Beecher Stowe's brother and Elizabeth Cody Stanton.<br />I am a firm believer in complicated information presented in an easily read fashion, and Dorrien's book fits the bill. I've actually been reading a history of Atonement Theory and Trinitarianism for light bedtime reading because it's so fascinating. Dorrien explores theology through biography, painting a realistic picture of the all-too-human proponents of the theory of the Divine. I also appreciate learning about the historical roots of an informed, loving, intelligent Christian faith that sought to fight against the fire-and-brimstone intolerant exclusivism of its day. A must read for Bible and religion students, seminarians, historians, and anyone who wishes to claim the historical roots of progressive Christianity.	2002-04-15

Holl looks at Gnostics, Cathars, renegade militant Anabaptists, and Pentecostals, all with superbly readable wit and touches of dry humor. This book is a golden example of theology that is fun bedtime reading as well. Interested in getting in touch with the heretics of history? There's no better selected guide.	2002-04-11

His look at a small fundamentalist church, a grassroots urban Mennonite congregation, and a market-driven &quot;megachurch&quot; illustrate the very different ways that Christians see their mission in the world and their relations to social, political, and economic structures. Watt reveals parts of his personality and his emotional reactions to what goes on in each church, but he also carefully analyzes the power structures, ethnic diversity, and gender roles in each congregation in an astute yet easily readable way. A must read for anyone wanting to get personal glimpses of the vast array of people seeking to be true to the Bible in very different ways.	2002-03-28

Anabaptism branched off from Luther's reformation because the early Anabaptist leaders felt Luther had not gone far enough in applying Scripture to everyday life. They stressed the importance of only being baptized upon truly understanding and accepting the Christian call, and of living out their faith rather than just professing it.<br />Snyder traces the various branches of Anabaptism, rejecting the notion that there was just one Anabaptist church. He compares the various leaders and their theologies, but never in a condescending or overly technical way. The final chapter crowns the book, asking what Anabaptists have to offer the various faith traditions of today, and what they can learn. I recommend this to Anabaptists seeking to learn more about their history, and other people of faith wanting to understand where the modern Amish, Mennonites and Brethren gained their faith.	2002-02-28

Wink suggests that the Powers and Principalities mentioned in the New Testament are the psychological underpinnings of complicated systems -- that is, that every corporation, church, government, etc., has its own personality that tends to take over no matter what the individual people involved. All these powers have a God-given purpose, but when they serve their own ends rather than human beings, they become demonic, and it is Christians' responsibility to confront them through nonviolent action and prayer.<br />Wink writes stirringly and concisely. He quotes frequently from Scripture, and uses examples from contemporary life such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Wink seeks to return the church to a foundation in Scripture rather than the accretions of Christendom and arcane theological theories. A must -read for any serious, thinking Christian who wants to live their faith and not just profess it.	2001-12-04

Rather than attaching historical study to the Gospels' message, Miles treats Jesus and his message purely through the text, and comes to a startling conclusion -- that Jesus' death was necessary because God failed to deliver on God's promise to the Israelites, and needed a way to triumph on a metaphysical level.<br />Whether or not one agrees with Miles' premise, he writes brilliantly and understandably. Recent Biblical scholarship gets bogged down in dry-as-dust unintelligible &quot;academicese.&quot; Miles understands the principles of clear and succint writing while still advancing complicated theories. I recommend this one for anyone seeking to stretch their understanding of what we have received as Scripture, as well as those interested in literature and how it relates to the Bible. Like him or not, read Miles to get your brain working.	2001-12-04

Infinite Jest covers every topic from complex mathematics, the troubles of gifted teenage athletes, drug addiction, the influence of the media, and things I probably didn't even notice. It looks huge and intimidating, but once I started I couldn't stop. Wallace's style is laugh-out-loud funny with occasional pauses for awed contemplation.

Harding combs through Falwell's history and sermons to observe how the language of &quot;being born again&quot; affects the listener, showing Falwell's shift from separatism to political activism.

The book assumes a Mennonite Christian perspective on why and how we seek to resolve conflict in our lives. The system is somewhat complicated, so I would urge you not to just dive in and assume you can solve people's problems on your own.

He covers how theologians are becoming increasingly irrelevant, points out how the church's refusal of jazz points to its sin of racism, and questions how the church can become as effective in its mission as the multinational corporations. Clapp displays a thorough and real understanding of Christian faith and contemporary culture, but never disappears in technical language or recycled, stale &quot;God talk.&quot; I highly recommend this book for pastors, laypeople, and theologians of all sects and political affiliations. Everyone will be challenged and affirmed.	2001-09-20

I found the Access Bible the best balance between pure, dry scholarship and completely evangelical footnotes that I don't feel comfortable with. The Access Bible has helpful full-color maps, a small concordance in the back, and an index. What I find most helpful, however, are the notes sprinkled throughout the text that help me gain insight into the way people thought and behaved in the time that Scripture was written. I recommend this Bible for any thoughtful believer who wishes to approach this most amazing and influential book with both spirit and mind fully engaged.	2001-09-14

It took a while to get flowing, but Marsh's father's battles with the KKK and Marsh's own struggles with his church's definition of sin and its latent racism make for a &quot;can't-put-it-down-yet&quot; read. I especially enjoyed the chapter where Marsh's father agrees to preach to a &quot;Jesus freak&quot; convention in California and comes away refreshed and renewed, with a sense of what the whole Christian mission is really about. Marsh vividly illustrates what was wrong with Christianity of the past and how we can claim an authentic and radical Christianity to make the world of the future a better place for everyone to live.	2001-09-10

His trademark seems to be exhaustive inspection of detail -- the detail of a puzzle piece, a dusty corner of a library, the curves of a woman yet unknown. This volume is worth reading solely for the first story, &quot;A Game of Clue,&quot; which simultaneously describes a family conflict during a session of the classic board game, and the action of the episode of Clue itself, complete with the twisted seduction of Miss Scarlet by Colonel Mustard. Ultimately, Millhauser's stylistic microscopic detail grates on the brain, and it best taken in small doses.

The plot is neatly stitched together, and you'll find yourself flipping back a few pages, mumbling sagely, &quot;Yep, that sure did happen back in Chapter Three,&quot; as well as being mildly freaked out by the malformed sorcerous freaks of 19th century London. What's the upshot? It's all a lot of fun, but nothing is terribly new or original. The clever knitting together of the plot is probably its best feature, but outlines do not a novel make. I read through it, laughed, shuddered just a teensy bit, and then neatly alphabetized it on my shelf. I probably won't read it again, but I didn't mind traveling around in time with Tim just once.	2001-03-27

I agree with Heyward's stance on inclusiveness within the church, and the importance of not letting our concepts of Christ get the better of us, but she seems to have left Christianity entirely behind, or worse, used isolated Christian terms for their cultural weight while reinventing them to suit her own personal agenda. Her Christianity relates not to church or the story of Jesus, even in an allegorical sense, but to the wispy New Age mysticism that reduces religion to nonsensical abstract terms with no reality or practicality to them at all. Her spirit is fluffy and her flesh is entirely absent.	2000-10-05
