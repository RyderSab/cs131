The author points out that between the two important ideas of, \\"atoms\\" and \\"symmetry\\" , have lead to maybe the beginnings of a \\"Unified Theory of Everything\\".  Between these ideas and physical clues, scientists are making progress, and can infer conditions within the early Universe, the shape of the Universe and even the direction it is evolving.  In the beginning chapters, it discusses that if all motion is relative, why does a whirlpool of water form a concave surface which really identifies it as the moving object.  Why does matter have the property of inertia? Is it the result of the Higgs Ocean?  What mechanism imparts a direction to time and disorder within the Universe?  This reader felt the author was genuinely concerned about leading readers of all levels to the answer, sometimes with exasperatingly small baby steps.  Although this reader could actually pinpoint the step where the reasoning became too complicated, I felt I never made such progress before in this area. Simple statements like, the reason Einstein felt that time dilated in his theory of Relativity is, if the speed of light is a Universal constant and the distance is the same, the only thing left is that time must change, I never heard it put so elegantly.  The author offers a very good and long explanation of the particle v.s. wave controversy, the theory of intertwined particles, where simultaneous effects on both particles take place faster than light could ever communicate the effect. The book explains that Time has a direction, and why.  This book offers perhaps the best explanations, analogies and illustrations of time slicing, excellent explanations of string theory, multi-dimensional universes, in short, after a multitude of space-time books, I feel most authors were parroting explanations of phenomena, with thisbook I feel like I gained a rung or two on the ladder of understanding. Perhaps other readers will do better, but I believe this book contains some of the best explanations of any book dealing with quantum, relativity, parallel universes, string theory and the search for the ultimate theory.  The reader will gain a sense that this branch of science full of handwaving physicists theorizing of what might have been is actually making progress.  I was fortunate to have read Steven Wienberg's \\"The First Three Minutes before tackling this book and I found it beneficial as an intro to this book. <br />	2005-09-18

Sometimes the author seems to be straining to talk about what influenced the young William Shakespeare.  The first part of the book covering his early life appears very wordy, grasping for evidence in what influenced young Will. <br />In later chapters of the book, ideas are supported by more scholarship and the ideas presented are more interesting.  The book is probably not the final word, on Shakespeare, but it seems to be a very thorough text covering his whole life.  The author presents many contemporary historical events and relates them to the works of Shakespeare.  A very rewarding book after a slow start.  The author to his credit presents different scholarly theories that he does not always agree with.  Some of the theories suggest there is evidence that young Will was a closet Catholic along with his father, and discusses the mystery of the missing years in Shakespeare's career. Also discussed was the strange downfall of his family's fortunes, a family of lower middle class standing with large civic duties suffered a reverse of fortune that they never recovered from until young Will became a famous playwright. <br />The latter half of the book ties in political events that probably became the germ for his plays.  The scandal where Dr. Lopez, a former Jewish doctor, to Queen Elizabeth  finds its parallel in the merchant of Venice. King James I fascination with witchcraft was mirrored on stage with the play Macbeth in the hope to get royal favors and revenue.  As Shakespeare reached retirement age he wrote the plays \\"A Winter's Tale\\", \\"King Lear \\" <br />And \\"The Tempest which the author relates to an elderly successful William Shakespeare  pondering retirement and bequeathing his wealth to his offspring.  The author did his research, and explained it well. <br /> <br />	2005-07-15

The USA has a very successful foreign policy, but is well disliked by a large portion of the globe.  The author contends that the American populace is shielded from the truth from the effects of its foreign policy.  This book, I believe will give the reader the idea that everything historically the USA has done in the area of foreign policy is wrong.  In the future the authors contends that in the era of sophisticated terrorism, there will be a backlash against the world's sole superpower.  The book also explains that in the future the force of world opinion will congeal and be harder to ignore to the point where the USA's course of actions will be limited.  The author definitely presents some good points, he knows his history and discusses points that are difficult to refute.  The future is unknown, but I find the Author's interpretation of the past events of our foreign policy much too negative.   <br />	2005-07-07

Contained within the text is really the mechanism that decided which civilizations were to be successful and which were to remain in the early stages of development.  The author does an excellent job explaining in clear easy to understand terms the reasons for Western European civilization's dominance.  A dominance to the point of colonizing the remaining lesser developed regions of the Earth. <br />In a nutshell the Author's point is that every primitive culture has already leveraged and maximized any advantage the environment has offered.  Western Europe had inherited and developed the gifts bequeathed from Mesopotamian civilizations including, domesticated animals, some optimal grain crops, some fiber crops.  With this springboard combined with the discovery of steel making and by happenstance a society exposed and partially immune to the affects of the major diseases affecting urban populations, it became an invincible combination to subjugate and rule major portions of the globe.  Areas of the world that did not benefit from having all the right ingredients or stepping stones to capitalize their environment and take them to the next level were subdued.  An example would be a culture without a suitable pack animal such as the domesticated horse doomed that culture to manual labor and almost certain losses when their foot soldiers faced mounted cavalry for the first time. Kudos to the author, big ideas,well thought out, and presented well <br />	2005-06-14

William Bennett is of the opinion that the nuclear family is the basic building block of civilization.  The author's concern is that this basic institution of society is responsible for nurturing the next generation and is being besieged on all fronts. Divorces are easier to obtain, the onslaught of teenage pregnancies not resulting in a Marriage commitment, same sex marriages, casual partnering, etc. The book is a good expose' of facts regarding, poverty and single incomes families, and the agendas of certain political groups.  Unfortunately many of the arguments appear weak, drawing conclusions based on intuition or appealing to the reader's gut feeling. Reading the book with a devil's advocate mindset, you feel the arguments are really not that strong.  With that said, it is still an informative book, that underscores a disturbing trend in our society that has been growing for decades.  William Bennett, the author never flinches from controversy and this is a book that needed to be written.	2005-05-13

Throughout his career, time and again he displayed first rate skill in naval tactics and warfare.  A naval strategist that favored using America's fledgling navy to reek havoc upon Britain's shore requiring Britain to commit some of its naval resources defensively.  John Paul Jones planned what the young America would require for a blue water navy to protect its interests while the new country was still in dire straits fighting for its independence.  Jones was one of the few American captains successfully squirmishing with Britain's overwhelming sea power. <br />This man should have been let lose upon Britain by the Continental Congress, except his ambition drove every one of his supporters away from him.  His crew, fellow captains, and allies gave him lackluster support and many plotted against him.  Indeed it can be seen in this book that some of the best opportunities to injure the enemy were squandered while Jones had to cajole his crew to follow his lead in the egalitarian ill-disciplined newly formed American navy. <br />Jones is seen as a man that came alive during struggles and was ill at ease during peace.  His remedy was to seek out commands with Russia's Black Sea navy against Turkey and France's continuing struggle with Britain. <br />A praiseworthy biography.  Good research, but the author introduces some of it in a way that interrupts the flow of an otherwise very compelling book.   <br />	2005-05-04

The book contains insights into his life, living a frugal computer-geek existence in Finland struggling to make his computer payments to eventually, a mansion in California and getting involved in the \\"American Dream\\".  It comes across in the book that the author did his research actually spending many personable hours with Linus and family.  <br />Aside from an anecdotal biography the book contains some gems. One is Linus's philosophy of the progression of technology.  The introduction of a new invention at first aids survival, then supports social order and efficiency, then as the invention becomes common place, the item is obtained for it entertainment value.  Linux  the operating system, was written, \\"Just for Fun\\" and so provides the title.   <br />  The other strong point of this book is that it contains one of the better explanations of the \\"free software\\" concept, licensing, and copyrights and licensing intellectual property v.s. creativity.  This reader would have liked the book more if it were a little more technical.  I also found the author's conversational style to the reader irritating as if talking to a child.   <br />	2005-04-20

I was not familiar with the name Tony Hendra.  As a young teen, Tony was introduced to a monk, Father Joe and his monastic lifestyle. The book is a worthwhile and very amusing biography of Tony growing up in Britain.  He eventually became successful in the States becoming involved on the editorial staff of the National Lampoon magazine and Spinal Tap.  He crossed paths with many celebrities.  This was an easy fast paced book, and the farther one reads the more engrossed one becomes to discover the final outcome.  A man that probably could have found inner peace with a monastic calling is living \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" in LA and New York and seeks out Father Joe and monastic peace periodically when his life takes a downturn.  I was a little disappointed because I thought the wild, out of control times, would be wilder and more out of control, but that is not fault of the author.  The final chapter does contain a twist giving the book a feeling of completness.  All in All, an story that is at once , amusing, informative, and has some seeds sown in for some deep thinking.  <br />	2005-04-14

This book is like reading two books in one.  The first part of the book had some very good writing about atomic particle research and excellent explanations of the experiments.  It also contains the author's surprisingly optimistic view that the theories being currently developed are the beginning of the correct path that will lead science to the \\"final theory\\".  The remainder of the book is a promotion of the field of particle physics to show that by reduction all the sciences can benefit and share in what is learned in particle physics. Chemistry, Biology, etc at their lowest levels operate at an atomic level.  Also some philosophical musings.  The author has a knack for explaining complicated ideas for the layman.   <br />	2005-04-08

It concentrates on the USSR submarine fleet.  This book has many things going for it.  It contains a very good background history of the Russian/ USSR navy.  It put many historical news items that one may have only heard in piecemeal fashion, in retrospect, such as the various disabled smouldering USSR subs that literally popped-up.  All in all, I thought this book provided invaluable new information, (at least new to this reader) than has been previously available.  The fact that the Glomar Explorer operation actually succeeded in recovering a USSR submarine codebook, a little more knowledge can be gleaned from this book about  the US Navy's underwater listening system SOSUS , some espionage and tactical information along with the damage the Ames and Walker spy intrigues actually cost the United States in day to day deployment terms.  The book's strong point is that it stresses the fact that the USSR put pressure to bear on getting results from its submarine fleet, but treated it as a poor relation to the overall USSR military budget.  Last in line for funding, maintenance and service.  Unsuccessful patrols would shorten an officer's naval career.  Yet the history shows that poor quality construction and safety procedures, maintenance and supply were the root cause of most of the failures.  The USSR sailors fielded crews subjected to higher risks, therby effecting greater sacrifices, sometimes the ultimate sacrifice was required to save the boat and crew.  The USSR's submarine fleet was actually facing a two front war, One front, the West from the Cold War and a steady technological challenge, the second front, the USSR military, fielding a fleet where the crew was subjected to substandard conditons of safety and a severe lack of supplies. <br />I would also recommend reading the book's appendix where Gorshkov (the USSR's Rickover) explains Russia's and the USSR's naval history in a socialistically pleasingway.  I thought this book was a real eye-opener,  It is evident the authors did their research, occasionally the material overlaps with some repetitions, but in relation to the amount of information provided it really remains a spellbinding read. <br />	2005-04-05

This book covers the first few minutes of the universe written by a Nobel prize winning physists, Steven Weinberg.  All in all, this text is a very good expose' and really not outdated for the casual reader. It covers string theory, the pros and cons for an open and closed universe, and dark matter question.  The meat of the book is based on the fact that as the original universe cooled, seconds after the big bang and sub-atomic particles were allowed to form. \\"If\\" the big \\"If\\" this primordial ball attained equilibrium then many assumptions can be made from present day evidence directly back to early primordial conditions.  The cooling proto-universe had particle formation ratios and radiation emitting frequencies that can be evidenced today. As the universe cooled additional particles were allowed to form and various radiation frequencies were allowed to escape. <br />The author Steven Weinberg has a very natural style of writing, translating the extremes of physical theory into a step- by-step progression of the beginning universe.  A very rewarding book.  <br />	2005-04-05

The Author still has empathy for the patient.  He has not forgotten the questions that patients struggle with.   This book presents a series of true medical situations.  It is the story of decisions that have to be made by physicians, sometimes fast paced decisions, maybe logical, rational or mundane decisions or forced decisions that have to be made, before all the facts are available.  \\"Complications\\" is really the story of the consequences, the twists and turns of these decisions.  This book will make one think about situations that the medical field faces.   <br />The author seems comfortable on either side of the fence, discussing the problems the physicians face and equally the concerns of the patients.  The author's discussion on the hospital procedure for corrective action is an eye-opener. It certainly does not appear to be as effective as corrective procedures in critical industries.  This book will draw you in, simply stories of medical situations that you'll think about it for a long time afterwards. <br /> <br />   <br />	2005-03-29

This book is like a thinking man's \\"Pilgrims Progress.  C.S. Lewis  has the whole plan of a soul's trip to the after life worked out.  The logic and symbolism is what makes this book.  C.S. Lewis has worked out a neat little belief system.   As a new arriving soul, C.S lewis narrates his journey, he meets other souls with personalities we have all met. Lewis's helpful guide explains away the problems other souls have in reachng the \\"mountains\\".  This book was a very thought provoking book presented in the context of an journey, all the while handling the major questions of life and religion.  One does not necessarily have to subscribe Lewis's reasoning to enjoy this book.  It can be read on the basic level, a simple jouney or as <br />an explanation for the major questions of life and death. One can see why Lewis's works maintain their popularity over the decades.  I thought some of the coversations of newly arriving souls was a litle long winded in some parts and it took away from the flow of the journey.	2005-03-17

Most chapters explain a feature or standard to be measured.  The chapters explain how the standard is traceable to NIST (National Institute of Standards and Testing) and explain how the Fluke Corporation performs its calibration.  This reader believes that if this subject matter appeals to anyone, the chapter overviews and summaries are the most interesting.  The book has many schematics and shows various testing and calibration circuits, enough to cause anyones eyes to glaze over.  This book is not really for someone in the general quality-calibration field interested in the \\"philosophy of calibration\\". I found it a narrow specific technical book that would be of interest to a few people planning to setup up a calibration laboratory for a large company or a service company.  This book really goes in-depth into the calibrating equipment, circuits and various alternative ways to measure the same feature. I reviewed this book to let it be known that the title is a little mis-leading and gives no hint to the onslaught of technical information within. The book is more for someone known as a calibrator's calibrator. It will give some appreciation to why some DMM cost $10.00 and some over <br />$600.00  <br /> <br />	2005-03-06

The result hopefully is a very accurate way to write a biography.  Dr. Paul Farmer, Superman, cannot help but impress any reader.  It sounds as if not only does he work superhuman hours with the poorest of the poor in Haiti, he really gives them his personal time, still he has time for fund-raising, keeping up correspondences, pioneering and affecting world health political agendas, writing books and becoming a world authority on tackling MDR TB (multi-drug resistant Tuberculosis).  In his spare time Dr. Farmer shuttles back to Boston, drops off cultures to testing labs and unbelievably also sees patients while in Boston.  I firmly hope that this guy is for real and unfortunately it also appears that he is one of a kind.  This book is full of hope when it is seen what just one man has done.  If someone like a hands-on Dr. Paul Farmer believes the onslaught of AIDs and new powerful strains of Tuberculosis on impoverished tropical populations can be controlled, who are we to argue and maybe his organization deserves a contribution.	2005-03-01

The text really ends about the stage of Europe's adoption of \\"Arabic numerals\\".   <br />This reader thought there were three main trends within the book. <br />1st. A history of how every culture formed its counting system, from Polynesians islanders, to Tierra del Fuego, various African tribes to ancient and extinct cultures, cuneiform, hieroglyphics, knot tying, tally sticks to body counting.  The author's blurb says the author Georges Ifrah spent 10 years in a worldwide quest recording different culture's counting systems.  The author is a truly unique man, nothing escapes this author.   <br />2nd  The overall views are interesting, and the illustrations are suburb. The different systems explained from a historical perspective are though provoking.  The author does a wonderful job explaining how each system works. <br />3rd   This book is really at the encyclopedia level.  The minutiae between the different counting systems of Polynesian body counting systems is of little concern, but this is how precise this book gets.  The info is there if its needed. <br />4th  There is no mention of mathematicians, Pythagoreans, ancient trigonometry or algebra in the book, just an expose' of numbering systems.  Thw author sticks with numbering systems. <br />The reader will be in awe of this book's informational overload.  I found the secret is to know what to read and what to skim and it makes a rewarding book to give one an appreciation of the numbering system we have today, and surprisingly other systems that have not been entirely retired such as tally sticks, and abacuses. <br /> <br />	2005-02-19

This open source development process started the author thinking about the two software development methods, the Cathedral method, where a large corporate structure hires programmers to develop software, keeps the source code secret, and charges large amounts to recoup it costs, not from the original product development, but from the expected legacy problems, technical support, bug fixing, software updates, etc.  On the other hand the bazaar method, encourages open source software.  Open source software encourages a programmer or group within the hacker community to gain ascendancy, to possess and maintain and steer the software to keep it relevant.  The Author's point is that with most business models in the future the Cathedral method (read Microsoft) will not be able to compete with the Bazaar method (read Linux).  In the Cathedral method the programmers must be hired, the bazaar method the hackers are attracted to a problem, become more dedicated, revisions and bugs are handled at internet speed.  The author tells of many real-life business experiences companies have had adopting the open source method.  The middle of the book explains the hacker ethic and how the hacker community operates.   The reader learns the true meaning of \\"hacker\\" v.s. \\"cracker\\" and the true meaning of free software.  The author predicts that open source software will make deep in-roads into the Fortune-500 companies.  That their investments in hardware and records may be dependent on one software company's decision to continue supporting that software revision is the problem.  Open source software would provide a proliferation of hacker communities willing to constantly update older software.  The author appears to know his stuff and progressively throughout the book the author lets it leak out that he is one of the hacker community and is a player/spokesman in this software battleI found this book a real eye-opener, can Microsoft's workforce  continue to support software like Windows 2000 with 60 million lines of code, as opposed to Linux taking advantage of a worldwide army of hackers reporting bugs, writing patches, and keeping hardware drivers updated.  Time will tell. <br /> This book was enough to prompt this reader to obtain a copy of Linux just in case.. <br /> <br />	2005-01-29

Mr. Bloom makes quite a case for his literary choice of monumental books that constitute a Western Canon.  Shakespeare reigns supreme in the author's estimation because his writings touched upon so many things universal in human nature. After Shakespeare no other author comes close to having such a widespread appeal to all of human nature and this is the author's point.  The first author to write, touch upon or pioneer the use of literature in a unique way, that has a lasting affect upon society.  The fact that the author's choices are almost all \\"dead white men \\", may have been a product of the society in which they wrote, but it does not diminish the affect their written texts have had upon succeeding generations.  Ignoring this argument this reader thought it was a rewarding experience to discover just what the author thought was noteworthy about some particular classic. A classic, put in the historical perspective of its time.  It spurred this reader onto reading a few classics I had missed.  The books sounded more interesting once I knew the significance of the work... Bloom's criteria and  reasoning for a Western Canon is educational, interesting, and rewarding to the reader.	2005-01-25

Beaumarchais was a survior of the French revolution, a government secret agent and a businessman that went deeply into debt to lend money for arms and ammunition to the young United States, a debt that was only begrudgingly repaid to Beaumarchais's heirs many years later.

He disdained the court intrigues and being captive to a powerful patron.  Ruben's plan was very modern, he set up a palatial house in Antwerp to attract the best art students as apprentices.  These apprentices would rough out paintings for Rubens to finish, greatly expanding his output.  His house also became a place to entertain the wealthy customers, and as a locale for his art collection.  As the most renowned and prodigious artist of his time, Rubens invested his wealth into a huge art collection. True to his business class ideal, in the midst of Europe's religious conflict, The Thirty Years War, his religion changed with convenience. Another side of Rubens is that because of his contacts and traveling he actually became involved in diplomatic intrigues carrying secret messages to the movers and shakers of the Thirty Years War, under the guise of painting their portraits.  The author is to be commended on this text. She cites many sources especially about Rubens style and technique, besides herown opinion.  The author includes insights into personal life gained mainly through his personal correspondence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-10

A haunting book written by a victim of a stroke that could only use his left eye to communicate. This is his story, written painstakingly by blinking on the appropriate letter as the alphabet was presented to him  The author portrays the mental toughness to cope with his condition on his \\"down\\" days,  The diving bell is the symbol when his condition weighed heavily upon him, such as when his kids visit him and he is unable to give the slightest response, save his left eye. The butterfly is the symbol of his mind as it is free to escape.  The author is generally upbeat, his mind trying to overcome his condition.

Isaac Asimov specialty was explaining difficult subjects to his readers.  He did an admiral job keeping the subject matter interesting.  Each short chapter is dedicated to a particle, ex. mesons, quarks, bosons. Each chapter also gives a little historical background of the search and discovery behind each particle and how it fits within the sub-atomic world. Nuclear physicists may have progressed far beyond this by now, but this is still a good book for piecing together the subatomic puzzle of particles.	2004-12-09

Other thought provoking articles cover, parallel universe theory, the smarts of an octopus,surprising when compared to its station on the evolutionary tree.  And some unsolved mysteries, how can a microbe that must be injested by a cat latch onto just the right circuitry of rat's brain to make it unafraid of cats.   <br /> This book is generally a fast read, no math and all the material is well explained.

This problem known as Fermat's last theorem still stymied modern mathematicians until Andrew Wiles armed with modern mathematical techniques and theory demonstrated a proof in 1994. <br />  This is one of Amir Aczel's better books.  A balanced book that succeeds in giving the reader a general idea of the mathematics involved. Mr. Aczel's explanation of a difficult field of math are very good, and keeps the reader's interest.  This author in many of his other works usually expands his text to the point where the story does not agree with the title or purpose of the book, This time he got it right. A short book, fast paced, occasional tidbits of interesting facts to setup a historical background of the problem and its solution.  It finishes with the trials and tribulations and eventual success of Andrew Wiles, a mathematician turned into a recluse being consumed and driven to solve this secret.   <br />	2004-12-07

The list that everybody has heard, sports and spatial tasks = boys,   penmanship, language skills = girls.   The saving grace of this book is that in the 2nd part the author mentions what should actually be done.   Michael Gurian, author/ educator, also has a few pilot projects being run in the state of Missouri. The results sound encouraging.  He encourages teachers to start catering to the needs of both genders in the class. He stresses that to do this teachers will need training.  As for parents the usual \\"be a concerned and supportive parent\\" is always added.  I was generally unimpressed with the book, no real blockbusters. The real world results of his pilot education programs were to me the issue that maybe the author was onto something. Hopefully if it is as good as its portrayed this method will gain some notoriety.	2004-12-07

He was a steadying force in the marketplace, especially in the area of the railroads where the competition was cut-throat.   The author tells of cases where Morgan would re-acquire ownership of a Railroad at a loss, because Morgan thought the owner was not running it correctly.  Time and again Morgan would risk money to uphold his business principals often losing money in the deal.  Eventually in later years the government stepped in with their regulatory agencies and performed much the same task that Morgan was performing.  The author gives some personal insights such as his style of art collecting and his lifestyle.  It is very well written, interesting, and appears to be well researched,  Morgan's scandals are also mentioned, but overall I am surprised at how straightforward and upright J.P. Morgan appears.  I had scant knowledge of J.P. Morgan, and this is the first book I have read by this author, but the viewpoint of this book is so different from what I expected it left me a little skeptical. This book will make the reader think twice that maybe J.P. Morgan is receiving a bum wrap from the reputation he has with the average man on the street's opinion of him. Call it cynicism, but this reader can not shake the feeling that there must more to this guy. <br />	2004-11-19

This book is another interesting and informative, but narrow subject history book of the type this author prefers to write.  In some sections it poses as a cookbook.  I was irritated by the amount of text actually devoted to Codfish recipes, when what I purchased was a historical type book .  The author has a very good writing style.  The book covers the early history of some cultures that took advantage of this bottom dwelling fish prized for its unique white meat.  The Codfish affected these early cultures as it still does today, where regional and national economies are suffering from the impact of worldwide diminishing Codfish stocks in spite of some sporadic conservation measures.<BR>      This reader recommends ignoring the all too frequent codfish recipes interspersed with the good historical information. This book makes for a fine compact interesting history of man's relationship with the Codfish.  Ignore the historical section and I suppose it would be a passable Codfish cookbook.	2004-06-16

This author has to decide if he wants to write a cookbook or a history book. It makes this reader hesitant to take on another book by this author entitled  &quot;Salt\\" ,  because a history of salt may bring an overwhelming list of recipes.  If the reader can ignore the history v.s. cookbook controversy, then the historical section is good writing, very interesting and informative.  It seems civilizations, and conquerors may come and go, but the Basques remain, always attempting to remain true to their laws and traditions. A small fringe Basque group employs violent terrorist tactics with the aim of forming a separate Basque nation.  The author conveys historical sympathy with majority of peaceful Basque people against the failed policies of the central Spanish government.  His view is that they are often portrayed as scapegoats.  I thought this sympathy may be a case of the author becoming a little too close to his subject matter and losing his objectivity, until the recent spate of train bombings in Spain.  The Spanish government's first suspect was announced to be the Basque separatist movement, but later it was discovered to be Islamic extremists.  All in all, it was a very worthwhile book dealing to inform oneself about the Basques and Basque history.	2004-06-11

Because of number of contributors, the information is a little repetitious and each author strayed a little into the other's subject area. What should have been a decision based on science and economics became heavily weighted down with political considerations.  The facts show it was a flawed decision making process.  Some of the contributing authors seem to say that the optimum place for Nuclear storage was not found, that the Yucca Mountain site was a political decision. If there had been a free exchange of knowledge and facts, then the correct site would have been chosen.  The public furor is the result of a bad decision making process, totally ignoring the strongest sentiment that drives the public with projects of this nature, \\"Not In My Backyard\\", no matter what the scientific facts may show.  Can science and some theoretical hand waving be relied upon to safely judge one site better than another for the duration of the next 10,000 years?<BR>  The book's chapter on how other countries are dealing with their nuclear waste was the most beneficial part of the book and also very succinct.  The authors lead the reader to topics about Carbon 14 leakage, other country's storage systems, and \\"engineered barriers\\", but after leading the reader to these terms little or no explanation is given. This is good book to get a slice of information about the Yucca Mountain decision process. This reader believes the subject matter is too narrow to really inform most readers about the process of storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain	2004-06-08

The author Jan Axelson is a rare example of someone that knows her stuff, explains it well to novices, and provides excellent generic examples of code. The examples provided cover situations such as; exporting data bits out thru the parallel port, reading info from the data port, searching for data ports and addresses, and using the parallel port to communicate pc to pc.  Seldom do you find a  \\"can-do\\" person that provides excellent instruction at a beginner's level.   The fascination of this book is that as home computers become more powerful, they are still limited in their effect on the external environment, except through dedicated peripherals, such as printers, scanners, etc. With this book, a pc port relay kit (purchased off the internet), and maybe a semester of Visual Basic instruction and &quot; you da man &quot;.  Once you can open and close a relay connected to your parallel port from a visual basic program you are off and running.  Most electrical devices in you home become fair game.  This book needs an update, except for a Tour-de Force in the beginning chapters of code segments in Pascal, Assembler And Quick-Basic, the remainder of the book is in Visual basic 4.0.   This reader had no problem importing the examples provided on the enclosed floppy disk into Visual Basic 5.0 .

This book should really contain the name of the city (Worcester, Massachusetts ) in the subtitle. This reader believes an intimate knowledge of the city of Worcester is central to appreciating this book, otherwise the locations mentioned within the text will just appear as an unconnected litany of place names..  The book painstakingly plots the spread of the Irish immigrant community across the city landscape, parish by parish. It explains the political tightrope walk the Irish-American and the American-Irish developed with the host culture and with the newer immigrant cultures also attempting to assimilate.  The author has done his homework.  Quotes from leading figures, Irish community newspapers and political speeches are exhaustive. One interesting point that agrees with Andrew Greely's book on Irish-Americans is that the Irish outside of New York City and the Boston area. assimilated quickly into the melting pot, but the ethnic identity and more mature, less vibrant, industrial economies of the Northeast cities made the immigrant battle for a \\"piece of  pie\\" more difficult, than in cities to the West. .The book shows that the history of the St. Patrick's Day  Parade in Worcester is a pretty effective barometer that highlighted the conflicts within the Irish-American community. The author is to be commended on the research, but any purchaser of this book should know that a knowledge of the city of Worcester and its institutions would be especially helpful to appreciate this book fully.  I gave it a three star rating because the quotes and research became a little too tedious in some sections.	2004-05-20

This book has  fallen into or is teetering on the brink of political incorrectness in some circles, but it is amazing that that is what is drawn from this book. It is one of the best accounts of the exploration for the source of the Nile river.  The source was not known by the world at large until a series of explorations and conquests took place. Taking an overall view, armies still clashed with the native inhabitants, explorers still faced hardships and ordeals. A portion of World History took place in this area,.in what was probably the last equatorial \\"Man against Nature exploration struggles  The book is extremely well written. A very entertaining style. I rate the Blue and White Nile together.  The White Nile led me to the Blue Nile book and a plan for some follow-up reading on the explorer, Richard Francis Burton.

The author intertwines the subject matter around a very well developed background, in fact a little too well developed.  The main story is about the human mind's inability to contemplate infinity .  The author points out that there are warnings in the Kabbalah, the Jewish book of mysticism, about peering into this aspect of mathematics. The famous mathematician Georg Cantor is credited with discovering and pioneering this area of mathematics.  Mysteriously every time Cantor attempted to seriously delve into infinity theory he experienced a mental breakdown.  Kurt Goebel another famous mathematician was also mentally affected by working in this area.  The very basics of what they were considering was performing mathematical operations on magnitudes of infinities.  Infinities of different sizes.  It is a strange concept but something akin to asking, \\"what set has more members, a set of all the integers or the set of odd integers \\"?  Once infinities are ordered then they may be ranked and considered eligible for mathematical operations.  This is the second book I have read by Mr. Aczel.  I believe the title of this book should have lead to the \\"meat\\" of the story, but the background history and the biography of Georg Cantor is given the same weight as the &quot;mystery of the Aleph&quot;.  The same was true of another book by Mr.Aczel, &quot;God's Equation&quot; the background material overshadowed the story. I would prefer a little more in-depth text about the heart of the matter.	2004-04-21

Thomas Huxley used a devastating one liner to Wilberforce's detriment and so it seems Darwin's theory of evolution was unleashed to become a commonly accepted fact or so these books seem to suggest.  When I saw this book I just had to read it. I discovered that William Wilberforce had a long political career as a MP in England. Mr. Wilberforce devoted most of his political career, over 40 years to abolishing slavery.  Wilberforce was almost single-handedly responsible for England's repudiation of slavery within its empire and forbidding British ships to engage in the slave trade.  He is also credited with creating a religious revival in British society as a result of his policies based upon a high moral code.  Wilberforce's life ends with a Hollywood flair, receiving news of his political success within hours before his death. But what about the debate?  Darwinism, evolutionism, and the Thomas Huxley debate? It was not mentioned at all.  I was a little disapppointd that the debate was not mentioned, but on second thought in the perspective of Wilberforce's life it probably does not rate mentioning. This book is well written, compact; it is this reader's type of book, short and to the point.  The author explained Wilberforce's accomplishments and his guiding principals.  More importanltly the Author in outline form sums up Wilberforce's life achievements in the last chapter, a very good technique that more authors should use to help instill the major points of a text.  The appendix consists of the a chapter of a book that Wilberforce's wrote.  This book had a great effect upon the British upper class and gives the reader a chance to sample the personal style of Wilberforce himself, in case the reader wants to read some of his original works. Very well done.	2004-04-19

It is the standard length of most Idiot's Guide books , but it packs a lot of information in a few pages.  The history of ethics and philosophy generally degenerates into a short boring expose' of the ancients, early Christian, Kant, Hegel, and then the modern Existentialists.  What is unique about this book was the explanations of real life situations.  The authors discuss Affirmative Action , abortion, and discrimination.  After each ethical system is discussed in Idiot's Guide format, memorable points are liberally highlighted in side bars, which is really not too bad a gimmick for learning, a theoretical situation is discussed that the critics use to highlight the weak points of that system. I always thought of ethics and philosophy as static fields, making no progress, but it does show that though we may not be getting more ethical through the ages that there has been an evolution of sorts in the field of Ethics	2004-03-26

Mr. Assimov was a prodigious workaholic author. In this book, written I suppose so he can get a book in the Autobiographical section. Isaac tells of his early life as the son of Russian-Jewish emigrants living in Brooklyn.  Work and study became his regiment early on in life.  I would recommend this book only if you have enjoyed his regular fare.  One can see the seeds of his future books as he goes about trying to select a career path. Assimov goes onto explain his activities during WWII and surprisingly the struggle he had to become an author.  Even a budding author with his talent needed mentoring. This is definitely a low-key verbose book that will appeal mainly to his fans. This book includes only his early career.  One of his memories was his father's look of surprise when he saw the ocean after they stood on their apartment building roof for the first time.  His family had been so intent on running their candy store business that years after arriving in New York they had never realized the ocean was so near.  The book is a series of these types of memories, no blockbusters, some would even say \\"its nothing to write about \\" but he did and it makes for passable entertainment.	2004-03-25

It is an amazingly thorough book . Some readers may find lessons here, some just a litany of facts.<BR> The Baldwin Locomotive Works was the dominant Locomotive manufacturer and capital equipment maker in the U.S. during the Gilded Age.  The company's experiences are still the experiences of today's manufacturing firms, especially the heavy equipment manufacturers.  The company began in the 1830's and closed its doors for good in 1956. In the decades close to the 1900's it was the dominant locomotive and heavy equipment maker in the country.  The author brings forth the following<BR>themes and issues this company dealt with are still very current with manufacturer today<BR> 1)balancing skilled and unskilled labor, running an apprentice program<BR> 2)concentrating on manger-producers, the company scorned professional or middle  <BR>    managent  to the point where foreman did the hiring for their departments.<BR>3) Labor strife was mostly non-existent for decades, the company's stated position  was <BR>      to make the company's goal the workers goal also.<BR>4) factory floor production control relied on a card and list tickler system to expedite job orders<BR>5) Located in the industrial down town of Philadelphia, it had a cadre of local close-knit <BR>      suppliers<BR>6) To spur productivity the company introduced piecework and often a group of workers would  band behind a foreman to act as in-house contractors. The workers would strive to perform the necessary cost cutting to produce a set number of parts for a set price  and if successful the profits from the savings would be split among the contracting group.<BR>7) A strong &quot;not invented here culture&quot; caused it to disdain efficiency work studies <BR>requiring professional middle management.<BR>   8) The impact of the paradigm shift from steam to diesel locomotive power.<br />  The Baldwin locomotive company also bridged the era of the introduction of gas and then  electric lights,  it boosted productivity as the same assets, buildings and equipemnt could now produce 24 hours a day.   In 1906 the company produced 2,666 locomotives, In the era around World War I the inevitable decline started.  It was a partnership company in world of corporations with their professional management.  Baldwin had a historically low profit margin making customer designed products. The custom designing took an army of draftsmen,and skilled labor at assembly.  The final nail in the coffin was General Motors entry into the market.  With a corporate structure, and years of experince in the American System of Manufacturing (mass production), GM lured the railroads over to standard design  diesel locomotives from Baldwin's custom built steam engines on price alone.  Baldwin's low profit margins prevented it from entering the Diesel market and effectively competing.  Instead the company went the way of the steam locomotive and closed in 1956.<BR>My hat is off to this author, he not only touched upon every issue, he excelled at  the explanations.  The style of using subchapters with titles reinforces the organization of the information brought forth.  This is not a book for everybody, but most people involved in manufactuirng or management will find something of interest.  Still the book is geared for the researcher.

This book is based upon the Leone edition, a 1755 English translation of Alberti's original work from the 1400's.  Alberta has a very modern succinct style. The chapters include many subchapters to help organize the information. He covers all the aspects of architecture and construction from laying the foundations to the wood joinery in the rafters, to adding the classical facade.  He reduces classical design to a series of rules, and proportions, most of which are still followed today when a classical facade is desired.  Alberti wrote with one foot in the modern world and one foot in the Renaissance world.  He still respects some of the superstitions of his time, but all in all it is a dry book?  I would not recommend this book to anybody unless they have a strong desire to learn about classical or Renaissance architecture.  The Leone edition also includes many very good plates of his drawings. These drawing are incredible for their time period and more informative than the majority of pictures in most modern architectural books.  I became interested in this book because of the plates portraying the construction of construction crane, but the font ruined the book for me. The publisher kept to the original 1755 font style.  I'm sure there is some value to this, but it cut the readability factor in half.  What could have been an enjoyable book was reduced to slogging through paragraph by paragraph, so (lector caveat) reader bewares?	2004-03-25
US	52381942	RN7MF6EZ5B4TW	0671622544	980392655	The Chip	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Excellent Account	An excellent account of the two Americans who ushered in the Intergrated Circuit (IC) age. It is said that the average American on a typical day encounters more than fifty microprocessors before lunch , from the alarm clock, to the microwave, to the daily commute in the automobile.  The transistor was a temporary godsend that made the vacuum tube obsolete. The limitation of transistor circuits was the soldering time and accuracy.  As circuit complexity exploded the number of soldered connections had to be increased accordingly. If a modern Pentium IC chip has over 60-million transistors, one can see that it would have been unattainable to obtain the required accuracy, time, and area need for these soldered joints.  Without these two men we could be at the transistor level.  Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce are the two men who developed the method of taking everything that was on a printed circuit and  etching it into a wafer of silicon (CHIP) making the device many magnitudes smaller in the process.  This breakthrough allows the complex circuits and microprocessors  with the myriad of battery operated electronic devices to exist. What we now accept as civilization. .The book is well written, no knowledge of electronics is required or explained.  It is just the history of two men developing a new idea to fruition.	2004-03-23

Giorgio Vasari was an Italian Renaissance artist who also wrote about the various artists of his time.  A contemporary of Michangelo, Georgi Vasari's book reads like a Who's Who of Renaissance artists.  For a book more than four hundred years old, the style is amazingly modern and interesting.<BR>Vasari has an artist's eye for critiquing another artist's work. His writing style is not boring, whereas many would be reduced to general descriptions like \\"beautiful\\" and \\"amateurish\\", he dissects the artist's work between strong and weak points, pigments and flesh tones or landscapes vs. portraits or the use of light and perspective. He states the reason why some art or one artist is renowned and others ignored.  His judgments have generally stood the test of time.  Vasari also weaves in some interesting tidbits and anecdotes of the Artist's life.  I found this book more interesting than many modern day Art History books.	2004-03-23

The author wrote a well-researched book in an attempt to show the factors involved in answering that question.  The author portrays a complex web of jurisdictions on the state local and federal levels that are involved in various projects.  Every policy has its winners and losers.  The book contains a little history of the Southwest, some personal interviews, many stories of the pork barrel politics involved to make sure the rest of the country buys into these irrigation and dam projects.  This book will be an eye-opener for most Easterners in this country where battling over water rights is generally not on the local political agenda.  A very rewarding book.	2004-03-20

As can be expected the major part of the book is about the industrial revolution and the struggle of cities such as London and Pittsburg to maintain a habital city..The coal industry became &quot;King Coal&quot; and became the industrial lifeblood in many countries.  A vital industry over which industrial sectors were formed and labor rights were gained. The Final chapters of the book deal with the pollution problems brought on by the burning coal.  Two serious points are brought up; <BR>1)  Society can engineer away most of the  pollution problems to the point where coal approaches almost perfect combustion. It will result in a much higher cost to utilize coal, and perfect combustion will still leave us with a massive Carbon dioxide output problem.  Perhaps accelerating the global warming scenarios <BR>2)The China question, as a large developing nation China is also heavily dependent on coal as a cheap and readily available energy source, and because of China's scarce resources it applies minimal polution control.<BR> This combination does not bode well for the future.  This reader thought the material was presented in a very professional manner.  It was not a \\"the sky is falling\\" type of book.  It is in fact a good book to obtain a balanced view. It explains how humans have lived with coal in the past and states that societies may have major decisions to make in the future.	2004-03-19

Tolkien, Charles Williams, and their Friends	Books	4	15	17	N	N	Very Well Done	Perhaps the best book to glimpse an overall picture of a world famous literary group that formed at Oxford University, around the era of World War II.    The author, Humphrey Carpenter performed an admirable job weaving the highlights of a University literary club dominated by C.S. Lewis, but also including members such as J.R.R. Tolkien, and Charles Williams and other lesser known contributors over a span of three decades.  Many of the members had literary works in progress  and used this group as a sounding board.  The members of the Inklings acting as critics. It was in this time period that Charles Williams perfected his poetical style, and Tolkien wrote most of his \\"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\".  This group was responsible for the inspiration and final output of many of its member's best works. The author would tell of the member's part within the group and tidbits of their lives outside the group.  Humphrey Carpenter, the author has mastered the technique of balancing the highlights of the Inklings as a literary group and also managed to include a little personal background on each of its members. A quick scan of the authors previous works will show that he could do this because he has written about some of the members individually.  The reader will feel that in this one book one has gained a true idea of the nature of the Inklings along with a neat biography of some of its members.  The Inklings as a group paralleled the life of C.S.Lewis, The group was at the height of its influence when Lewis`s career was at its  peak and then as different writing styles became fashionable, members of the group also  died or were replaced.  This book is worth the read, one sees the spark of an idea formulated by this group later brought out as a book by one of its members.	2004-03-19

This book analyzes a modern-day shipyard in Maine in a unique way.  The Bath Iron Works shipyard has a long history that mirrors this nation's shipbuilding legacy. The author gives a brief history of the shipyard, with its economic ups and downs. The meat of the book explains how a U.S&gt; Naval order for a new Arleigh-Burke class destroyer is fabricated.  The components literally snake their way through the shipyard over months. The book weaves a little personal history of some individual workers and their duties and how it ties into the final end-product.  BIW is a modern shipyard, using modular construction and a BIW pioneered upside down fabrication technique. The description of the launching<BR>process is intriguing. This book is an easy read.

The basis of this book is that, worldwide the knowledge and the production of iron and steel had reached the point where certain engineering visionaries dared to start considering the material?s properties to build on a grander scale than traditional wood and stone would allow.  In little more than the span of a century these diverse engineering projects set a new world standard in their respective fields, and it became the basis for catapulting Western civilization into the modern era of undertaking grand projects. Deborah Cadbury, the author has a very nice writing style. The subject is easily understood, and there is no math.  The author evidently did a large amount of research, she includes a bit of background material, but keeps the subject relevant to the central theme. The author does not delve into the engineering details of the problems, but generally strives to give the reader an overall view of the main problems encountered, usually a collection of engineering, financial and political obstacles.<BR>As with most books explaining engineering techniques, a few more diagrams would have been helpful. One consistent pattern throughout many of the projects is that the Engineer/Visionary generally were obsessive control freaks when it came to their projects, and as their project came to life it manifested itself as exacting an equal toll on their health.  The title is a little misleading, three of the projects, London Sewers, Bell rock Lighthouse, and the Hoover Dam deal mainly with stone or concrete.   The subtitle would be better suited to be the title of this book.  This reader highly recommends this enjoyable book	2004-03-15

You don't have to put up with hundreds of pages of the conversations of Howard Roark, Dominique and John Galt.  This reader is always surprised by the perennial claim that the author's Fountainhead novel is rated second on the all time best seller list after the Bible. For the reader who wants some exposure to Ayn Rand's philosophy called Objectivism,  this book, &quot;The Virtue of Selfishness&quot; is the way to go. This way the reader can cut out the middleman and get the philosophy  straight from the author. You actually get a more well rounded view of her philosophy. As a reader who  tackled both the Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, I consider my time was better spent with this book.   My problem with this book is that I feel the author could have done a better job explaining how Objectivism would work within a society, not just the individual. Ayn Rand extols pure capitalism and the U.S.A. was her adopted country, and the country closest to her ideal. Why didn't she mention or explain away examples such as J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie or John D. Rockefeller where the big winners can actually change the rules of the game from &quot;free for all capitalism&quot; to monopoly.  The book is also<BR>silent on the segment of society requiring charity.  What would be the effect on a society based solely on Ayn Rand's philosophy ?	2004-03-12

Examples of this forces are, gravity, nuclear binding force, weak and strong force, density of the universe  etc.  The author's thinking is something like this, If gravity was stronger the big bang would have spent its outward force already and be contracting.  A two-billion year cyclical universe would not have the time to form planets, or for life to form. If gravity was less strong then planets would not have appeared.  The author proceeds through each ratio, considering the  min and max values.  Vary too much from the present ratio and we would not exist, or life, the earth or the universe would not exist.  Interesting concept. The surprising thing is the narrow range of some of  the values. It shows that we exist from a combination of these numbers within such a narrow range that it borders on the miraculous that we exist at all.  Is this. an argument for infinite universes with infinite chances to form or a universe built upon a  master plan ?	2004-03-10

Einstein thought he was mistaken and corrected the formulas.  The author does an admirable job keeping the subject interesting .  The reader is exposed to the history of the experiments to prove Einstein's theory along with a large amount of anecdotal and biographical material of the main characters involved.  No math is really discussed in this book, just the conclusions of mathematical formulas.  I think the author included a little too much extraneous background. The reader should be prepared for an onslaught of material that makes one wonder if the author is begging for material to fill the pages.That point aside, I consider this author still one of the best at explaining science to the layman.  On a par with  Isaac Assimov in that respect.	2004-03-05

Another victim of the ills that plagued that sector of American manufacturing.   The original owner had a better idea, started a company, grew the company, carved out a market niche, built machines to order as the industry as a whole had done for years to survive the natural boom and bust cycles.  The Burgmaster Company was ill equipped for the foreign invasion especially of the Japanese machine tool industry, building standard machines, promising fast installations, losing control of their patented technology even though it was licensed.  Burgmaster was typical of the industry and experienced it all.  The squeeze between developing new technology and keeping the bread and butter production machines moving., losing control of its operations and planning by joining a conglomerate. As a former employee for what was formerly the largest American machine tool maker and is now a downsized and dismantled holding company, this book gave a good overall historical summary of what was happening then, which you don't realize when you are experiencing global and national trends day by day on a local level.

An audio book is a disadvantage to a reader trying to participate in the brain exercises while on the daily commute. The book format would have allowed a sedentary reader to take advantage of the information provided.  I was not able to flip back and forth easily or mark pages to return to.  I thought the book (tape) would be more about brain architecture and how Mozart's brain actually would differ from a fighter pilot's brain.  There is a little speculation about how the brains of the MTV generation cope with image overload versus the previous generation's method of acquiring information.  The title is a little misleading.  It really is a book about brain exercises, because the author believes these exercises help keep the brain young and healthy.  It is the old theory of \\"use it or lose it\\" adapted to the brain. I do not know if I totally subscribe to this theory, avid readers seem to be the first to wear glasses, hockey and football players retire with injured knees.  The book on the whole is interesting.  Definitely worth it.  It presents some unique ideas and it's a noble goal to keep your brain active even if the exercises were to have no effect.	2004-02-17

The author researched public documentation to provide evidence of the money trail from some quasi-charities to fund Islamic terrorist groups. The author's point is that there is plenty of information that can be gleaned from public records that is not being noticed.  If  the info. was effectively utilized, it would provide greater protection by shutting off a source of funding.  The author was originally a young girl from an Iraqi Jewish family, whose father was accused on spying for Israel and executed.  Her family fled Iraq, and she eventually made her way to New York City.  The author's knowledge of Arabic, chutzpah in infiltrating Islamic fundraisers and extensively researching public records has resulted in a vast database. One constant theme throughout the latter half of the book is her low esteem of the anti-terrorist measures being taken by the U.S. government.  The author's main target is the FBI, which is portrayed as being inept. One hopes the author is mistaken, but since the U.S government does not shed any light on this, it is a one-sided view, but a view supported by many examples of what appear to be mistakes and oversights. <BR>A very interesting book and an easy read that also provides food for thought.	2004-01-28

The first part of the book gives a little history of germ warfare already instigated by radical terrorist groups, and the role it played in the Cold War.  In more recent history, concerns about possible germ warfare and/or bio terrorist attacks led to certain actions  in the era of Desert Storm.   I would have desired the book progress from giving an excellent historical account to explaining the current public debate,  Is there protection to be afforded by spending money on public health measures ?

Overall the good points, and unique views were worth it.  I thought the author had some well thought-out ideas but meandered on the supporting arguments.   The main idea being the ancient Greeks had four words for love depending on the type of love.  C.S.Lewis analyses these types of love; Affection, Friendship Eros, and Charity. I suspect most readers will be surprised when they read what is included in each classification.    I would recommend an audio version of book.  The supporting arguments are better suited to the ears, which are more adept and can selectively tune-in.  I plan on reading other books by C.S. Lewis.

The author uses a well thought out progression of chapters; the Role of the Plant Engineer in Energy Management, onto perhaps the most important chapter, Energy Economic Decision Making, which includes sample solved problems. Later chapters progress to electrical system optimization, utility optimization, heat transfer and losses, HVAC systems and cogeneration, and finally the future of energy conservation, where the macroeconomic effect of implementing current technology is discussed.  The DOE is currently sponsoring projects in various common industrial processes that consume much of the nations energy, such as petroleum refining, and pulp processing where conservation and the latest technology will shave quads of BTU's off the nation's energy consumption.  The early chapters in the book tell how to prioritize the conservation measures in a particular plant, the value of the present expenditures v.s. the future for estimating payback periods.  The text is very well written, but it is surprising that a book on its sixth edition should be so full of typos, the grammatical ones can be figured out, but the ones concerning the solved problems should be corrected.

When all instances in the time period covered by the book are downplayed, the reader loses a sense of what is important.  Graham Greene's experimentation with Russian roulette, and a flirtation with foreign espionage are told in an attitude that makes it difficult to sense its importance. Was his spy work unimportant, or was it Greene's ho-hum attitude toward spying coming through.  The tint of boredom and failure extends over every aspect of his very fortunate and privileged life.  An Oxford education, career editor on the London times, courtship, marriage and a religious convert to Catholicism all seem to be performed robotically without any passion.  It definitely is an apt title.  The book really does stop short in his career as a successful author.  I am unfamiliar with his later writings, but this book mentions the fact that he feels alive when traveling throughout the world's danger spots.  In this autobiography, Greene mentioned in later years he would cover a local insurrection in Mexico, and viewed first hand the troubled years in Vietnam, Liberia and the Mau-Mau insurrection.     I would rather have skipped this book and read his later works about his experiences.  I would recommend this book only to someone interested in the psychological background of Graham Greene.	2003-12-22

He has very good credentials for writing this book.  He has a writing style that keeps the material interesting, and he appears to have a very good knowledge of the interpretation of Hebrew scripture.  With all this, the reader will wonder why the author ever came up with the title &quot;Gift of the Jews&quot;.  The title is misleading when compared to the contents of the book.  Every chapter except the final chapter of the book consists of background explanantions of major events in the Old Testament. His interpretation is interesting, but it is the final chapter that deals with the intended subject.  How a nomadic desert tribe's world view came to be the dominant idea in Western culture.

The central question or &quot;mystery&quot; of the book as the title suggests is why  the developed countries of the world have become so good at producing capital and the majority of countries are unable to emulate them.  The optimistic point of view of this book is that the amount of unutilized capital in even in the poorest of countries still dwarfs the amount of annual foreign aid they receive.  The author contends that when the riddle of how to release this untapped resource is solved the market dynamics will take over and the benefits will be reaped. The major economic power for most of the poorer countries of the world is in the underground economy.  Keeping the underground economy outside the legal system and the protection it provides stifles the country's growth.  The populace of every country has already maximized their competitive advantage within the rules of their local marketplace. What remains to be done is to legalize the marketplace laws over that particular nation as a whole.  A national system that incorporates this underground market and legalizes it will obtain the market dynamics that the developed countries enjoy.  The author is a noted economist from a third world country, the fact that he is from a third world country may have helped him question the idea of capital production.  The author feels that economists from developed countries have forgotten their own economic history and gloss over the importance of a legalized marketplace.

Detractors from every quarter denounce the lack of cohesiveness when compared to other country's foreign policies.  The author's main points are;<BR> 1) That in spite of this stumbling and bumbling, historically the USA has had one of the  most successful foreign policies of any country, especially when the country was developing in a world of powerful meddling European states. The success of the US foreign policy may have been successful just because as the Author alludes to a analogy of many countries having a foreign policy like a ship, it sails in one direction, with speed, but if it hits a rock it sinks, The US foreign policy is likened to a raft, everybody gets their feet wet, but a raft doesn't sink when it hits an obstruction.<BR>  2) The book examines the history of the four main viewpoints of American foreign policy that are still active today.  The author incorporates numerous examples of why certain actions were taken throughout the history of America.  The final foreign policy action is actually a resultant of the clash of beliefs within various segments of the USA.<BR>    This book is highly recommended as an overview of the history and present state of American foreign policy.  The book is well written and unbiased.  If the reader wants a better understanding of the foreign policy of the USA, this book is the answer.  It dissects and explains the various forces in American policy making.	2003-11-25

In the 1930's a White Amazon river trader's daughter is kidnapped by the Yanoama, a tribe of Amazonian Indians.  This pre-teen is adopted by the tribe and assimilates into the Stone Age culture over the succeeding twenty years.  The lifestyle, experiences, and culture are fascinating and bizarre.  Helena Valero never forgot her roots.  She eventually escaped along with one of her children to a Salesion mission.   Her original white family rejected her. She lived her life doing menial work at the mission, making sure her child received an education at the mission school.  She had had a hard life in the forest, beaten, and bartered, but effected her own rescue only to be rejected by her original family and told to get a job and start supporting herself and child.  At the mission she was looked upon as just another native inhabitant trying to acquire western ways.  I am a little suspicious of this story because there seems to be a total lack of notoriety.  If a Helena Valero were to walk out of the Amazonian forest today she would be deluged with book and movie deals.  I believe the truth of the story comes out in the details.  The facts of her story and her intimate knowledge of tribal life seem to bear out the truth.	2003-11-19

This book subtitled, \\"A Scientist Audits the Earth \\", sounded like the charm. I would generalize by saying Pimm's audit of the earth contains much of the \\"same old same old \\" and a lot of subjectivity.  Factual information is hard to come by.  In this book it requires over 100 pages to explain the process of estimating the amount of arable land available for crops.  His explanation of his travels are interesting, but is this audit material ?<BR>For a real audit of the environment I recommend The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World by Bjorn Lomborg.  Lomborg's is a statistician and this book I feel really performed a audit of the environment.  Stuart Pimm's  book, The World According to Pimm pales in comparison to the factual information presented in Lomborg's book.	2003-11-11

It is a case where a well to do Russian family whose 19 year old daughter Sonja is courted and eventually marries Count Leo Tolstoy, a worldly middle-aged aristocrat and soon to be successful author.  Count Tolstoy takes his young bride back to his family estate where she becomes a loving loyal wife and they start a family.  <BR>The marriage and family endures various flare-ups as Sonja remains the loving loyal wife, whereas Count Tolstoy evolves from novelist to pacifist to espousing strict monastic type rules for living the proper life as he attempts to achieve the life of a religious ascetic.  <BR>Count Lev Tolstoy had a reputation at that time as Russia's greatest interlectual before finally achieving a lifestyle as a sort of Russian holy-man, a wandering religious ascetic, just months before he died.  The world saw him with his disciples, Tolstoyans, as they were called, championing the lot of the Russian serfs, running schools for the serf's children, and espousing doctrines comparable to strict monastic rules for living.  Count Tolstoy over time became more dogmatic, revolutionary and estranged to family life, Sonya, by contrast remained fiercely loyal to her husband, and family throughout the marriage.  She wrestled with the management of the estate, fought to preserve literary rights to provide income for the children, while her husband was becoming less worldly, dividing the estate among the serfs and assigning his royalties to his followers.  Sonya was using her influence and contacts in the Czar's court to keep her husband from being arrested for political agitation. Count Tolstoy publicly had the sympathy of the people. Sonja appears as the reason behind Tolstoy's failures.  This book makes one sympathize with Sonja as she copes with an increasingly dogmatic difficult vacillating husband.  Nevertheless, a strong love was present throughout the marriage and the sad farewell death-bed drama of the Count as he lingered on in a railway station was a scene that Hollywood would envy.  <BR>The book was very well written.  The private story of this marriage is divulged through an incredible amount of research, gleaned from interviews of surviving members of the household and largely the personal diaries of both the Count and Countess Tolstoy.  The same family events and flare-ups are seen from the perspective of both sides largely from their respective diaries or letters. It makes one see Count Tolstoy in a different light.	2003-10-24

This is perhaps the best book to give an overview on the major covert activities of the CIA and its ancestor agencies.  A very well researched book.  The author appears to have done an immense amount of research to write this book.  Very informative and an easy read. The author appears to be unbiased and without an agenda.  Every tidbit of covert CIA activity that I read about in past years was discussed in this book, plus many more activities new to me were discussed. Drawing upon this text I believe the average American can get a better feel for the sucess and failure rate of covert activities, risks v.s. advantages.<br />  These covert activities ofter are the first steps that leads the U.S. into succeedingly hostile overt activities. The process is complicated by the fact that a covert operation has some loose oversight within our democracy.  The author gives the reader a good feel for the past endeavors of the agency and analyzes the results.<br /> I would recommend this book to any American because wherever the CIA is most active will generally be a place where crucial and influential American foreign policy decisions will follow. It is beneficial to have the past record of covert activity available. Covert activity is as the author states probably the most convenient and easiest way to accomplish a short term foreign policy objective and always a temptation to every U.S. administration, but it often comes with the price of a longterm political backlash from the populace involved.	2003-06-23

Taking the book at face value, I believe the author has presented the facts truthfully.  The author who also contributes to the Rolling Stone Magazine claims to have followed them on some tours and appears to have been on good terms with the band members. He shows evidence of cross checking stories and sources and notes discrepancies when they appear.  I believe its one of the better and fair judgments of this band.  Although the bands career follows the usual, struggle, hard times, brief honeymoon period, then indulgent self-destructive period\\", the book portrays the events that were going on in the life of Nirvanas leader Kurt Cobain.  I would say this book's strongest attribute is portraying the personal struggle of Kurt Cobain on a roller coaster ride of fame with Nirvana.<BR>   A weak point may be that the songs origins and lyrics are not explained well.  It may be because Kurt Cobain many times wrote the lyrics almost impromptu just before a recording session almost at a  stream of consciousness rate.  Maybe the origin of the songs has no deep meaning or origins.  Besides being an interesting story, the other highlights are the bands relationship with corporate bands, boomer music, heavy metal bands, and other Northwest so called Grunge bands.  I would definably recommend this book as an overview of Nirvana.  I know some die-hard fans have blamed Courtney or the corporate record company feverish touring dates for Kurts eventual suicide, but as the book amply points out Kurt and the band had some problems all stages of notoriety, and Kurt as the Band's leader was a time bomb waiting to explode. I think the book portrays the best<BR>non judgemental view of Kurt Cobain's life.  The particular edition I read include a final chapter added to include some<BR>info on Kurts farewell note and service.	2003-06-23

America should better define what it wants its institutes of higher learnig to accomplish; to impart a better foundation in Western cultures?  Less lucrative, tenure free professorships?  This book is an expose' of higher education in America.  Do we really want professors to concentrate on research and publishing while performing minimal teaching tasks?  The book gives examples of what happens to professors that concentrate on teaching, and forgo the research, or a professor that is not politically correct.  Do we want most of the student body being taught by postgraduate student, many times unable to impart their knowledge because of a bad command of the English language?  Definitely a book that makes one think about the proper place and use of a valuable asset like our universities.  The book is strong on singular examples, but I beleive it was a little weak trying to portray the extent of many of the problems in higher education. definitley worth the read just to know what the trends are in higher education and I believe it would help one select a college based on the facts within this books.	2003-06-23

On a larger scale it will and is affecting manufacturing everywhere.<BR> Henry Ford was the founder of the American mass production system, and Ford was very successful adopting it to the aircraft and steel industries. American companies adopted this system and it is one of the main reasons for American pre-eminence in many industries worldwide.  Toyota has become the founder of the Lean system of manufacturing.   Most of the<BR>early adherents to this system were other large Japanese companies, and responsible for the Japanese manufacturing miracle since the 1960's, as it was adapted from automotive to all manner of industries.<BR>     The book is well written and interesting even though it is based on an MIT study of global trends in the auto industry.

If Japan and Korea have some of the most efficient auto manufacturing plants in the world and<BR>North America is becoming more competitive, what is happening in Europe comes as no surprise.

It stems from the fact that as the Author mentions, in the case of blood clotting to close a simple skin wound involves 268 different chemical processes to turn on and off at the proper time.  The Author's point is that it is too much to believe that in the eons leading up to the development of life that countless life forms bled to death because they had perhaps one, two, or 267 of the processes developed by random, but not neccessarily the correct 268 processes needed.  The Author then points out that if all of the critical life processes needed hundreds of processes with numerous complex biochemicals what are the chances of life developing without adhering to a grand plan,  Example, If the life form that developed the perfect blood clotting process did not develop a correct digestive or reproduction system then that blood clotting<br />process was all for naught.  The large numbers involved cripple our ability to obtain a gut feeling for the probablities.  After all if the sun was to not shine one day every 100,000 years, the people that experienced it would consider it a miracle, eventhough it may have happened 45,000 times since the earth had formed.  This book will force you to think.<br /> Did life spring from tidal pools of biochemical soups where an almost infinite number of chances over billions of years actually succeeded, or is there a push, a plan of Life for this planet.	2003-03-05

It is a pretty good book once one gets past most of the anti-Dan Rather<BR>intro section.<BR>  The book makes some good points, gives some examples and that is that.  This book is a fast read, and it is worth this fast read because it makes one realize the thought processes behind the large network News organization. Readers will find themselves watching the network News with this book in mind. <BR>     The author is quite repetitious, and makes the same points throughout the book.  The main fact of the book is that the News organizations of the large television networks became money making operations.  In order to hang onto this income, the News<BR>stories do not always portray the facts, but are shaded to appeal to the target audience.  The same audience that the avertising sponsors are appealing to.<BR>This book wasn't a real eyeopener after all this is the television industry.  It will probably not open up a whole new<BR>world of facts to the reader.  It just delved and verified  some unsavory facts about how the network News is prepared and served up for it intended audience.<BR>This book is worth the read because of its unique insight offered by a network News insider.	2002-10-03

This book is well written and backed up by recent events.<br />  A very timely book.  Now that the cold war is over their was/is a feeling in the West that the non-west of the world will, as they modernize become westernized.  This author points out the fallacy of this argument. Europe borrowed incessently throughout its history before the industrial revolution and<br />stayed unique and true to itself.<br />  The Non-Western civilizations are going to import Western technology and some of the ideas, but conform it to their civilization.  He proves by citing recent events how the world is actually aligning along civilizational lines.  Historically, people felt allegiance to their clan or tribe which later progressed to the feeling of a nation-state.  Now the stage is set where the population of the world will align themselves with the major civilzations of this world. There is a scarcity of resources, and the world is a more crowded place the tensions between civilzations will intensify.<br />  This is another eyeopener book, one that will make you view world events in a different light. The author backs up his points with ample recent historical evidence.<br />  An example is the world alignment in the recent Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo conflict.  The second and third tier supporters of the combatants all aligned along their historicial civilizational supports.  The West mainly back Western Christiandom.  The Muslims gained the support of the Islamic countries and Russia supported Serbia, an eastern orthodox country.  This book I believe will give one an insight into the future of the worlds conflicts.  You will look upon these conflicts in a new light and understanding and differentiate between intra and inter-civilzational conflicts.	2002-10-02

Ishi was the last remnant of a California hunter-gatherer tribe.  He was starving and near death when discovered by a California rancher.  Thus began his journey from primitive beginnings, to journalistic sensation, to scientific curiosity, and finally as a working member of society in the California of the 1920's. and `30's.  As the subject of scientific study, Ishi shows that basically people everywhere and for all time are the same, but it is the differences that of course makes it interesting. One example is that at first anthropologists thought Ishi could not count above the number ten.  It was later found that he saw no reason to count abstractly.  He had a numbering system that extended quite high when physical objects were present. One of the most shocking revelations for Ishi,  were not the buildings, cars, trains or machinery of modern life, but the number of people that existed. This is a man who had never seen a crowd of people, he had watched his remote lingering tribe-members die off when he was a child .  A hunter-gather lifestyle can only support a sparse population.  From Ishi's perspective the largest crowd and perhaps the world consisted of those fifty tribe members when he was a young boy. The book gives a humorous account of Ishi's shock of seeing a crowded San Francisco Beach on a hot summer day.  The book is very well written, an easy read and very entertaining. It is surprising that this book is not more popular.	2002-08-06

An introductory type book that does an excellent job of giving an overall view of what the genome project is discovering and what the human DNA code contain. Each chapter deals with a specific segment of our genetic code.  It is not a deep Chemistry or Biology text, but generalizes in what the specific area of each gene segment controls or affects. This book will challenge you to consider the wider ramifications of the genetic code and to consider the whole picture.  It is very well written, and informative.<BR>     It is very interesting that the code is so flawed,full of repetitions, repairs, and fragments of genetic battles in our evolutionary history.       <BR>    This is a book that one thinks about long after reading it because of its unique information.	2001-12-03

I found the book fascinating and it answered many questions, among them why the height vs base of the pyramids automatically contain the value of PI.  This book discussed the anchoring of todays skyscrapers and large structures.  This is a book that explains where the forces and loads are projected and how they are contained and countered without getting into the mathematical aspect of it.  This author did an excellent job in conveying<BR>the logic behind structural engineering.  Well done.	2001-11-26

This book<BR>deal a smaller subject area and is interesting for that one<BR>area.  It deals with the nature of thoughts, memories and consciousness in the physical world.  If everything is structured of atoms and molecules where are thoughts located.<BR>Could physical representations of thoughts and memories be created ?  If you had a wiring schematic for a certain person's brain could you read their thoughts.

The author does an exceedingly good job of explaining the property or behavior of a material. He then proceeds to demonstrate the direct relationship between the properties and how the material is utilized and how it affects of the overall design of the structure.  The book discusses why construction steel really is the preferred material for most large structures.  Comparisons of soft metal chain vs. high tensile strength suspension bridges or bi-plane vs. monoplane design are discussed. I would recommend this for anybody that wants a well rounded basic understanding of why structures are the designed the way they are. The math is at a minimum, the concepts are very well explained and real world examples are used frequently to keep it interesting.  The author's career has exposed him to a multitude of design failures and successes. He readily explains them along with his philosophy of design and accident prevention.    This is another one of those books that can in a few chapters explain the major goals and problems in the modern field of design and materials science.	2001-07-11

This book contains many good sections dealing with the history of the Trail, its geology, ecology, famous hikers and folklore. These are the high points, and its quite good. The author makes one realize the beauty we have missed from the effects of acid rain, the decimation of the Elm and Chestnut trees to disease and the loss of the virgin forest in general. The problem with the story is that it dwells the majority of the time on the inane and tedious conversation of  two hikers.   Another disappointment with this book is that they sampled the Appalachian Trail and did not actually hike the whole trail.  I thought I was going to read about the tenacity and mental toughness it would take to tackle the whole Trail.   All in all, it was a worthwhile read for some of the knowledge gained, but it must be gleaned from the passages in between the conversational sections.	2001-06-28

It is a very enjoyable book. The philosophy and beliefs are brought out in a series of experiences, many of them humorous, about the unique characters, role models and lessons learned in trying to adopt an early Christian communal attitude to charity and bring it to the streets of New York City. Dorothy Day lived her beliefs intently.  Over the decades it resulted in running many urban soup kitchens, Hospitality houses, a farm or two, along with publishing the Catholic Worker Newspaper and authoring this very inspiring book..

This book answers the difficult problems accompaning implementation of the Toyota Production System.  It is written in an easily understood straight-forward style. In my opinion this is the best book on boosting shopfloor efficiency. It does not shy away from discussing the problem areas. The author proves he has &quot;been there and done it&quot;.      An example is the Kanban system usually described in most books as a sytem where cards control the shop floor work flow.  This book describes in detail various Kanban systems to handle the situations where the work flow is interrupted by processes requiring outside vendors or where an operation such as heat treating will slow the process.   I rated this book five stars because it discusses real problems and solutions.	2001-05-17

If you are one who likes to dwell on the big idea of this world this is the book.      Like a modern day Pythagoras, the author shows how mathematical properties or themes are expressed in various media. The title shows it is mainly concerned with the underlying relationship in the works of Godel, a mathematician, Escher, an artist, and the composer, J.S. Bach.      This book also intertwines a host of other fields to demonstrate the same underlying concepts are prominent in such areas as the genetic coding, fractals, computer language, logic and philosophy.     This is definitely a book that will leave an impression. The author, Douglas R. Hofstadter has developed well thought out concepts.  He demonstrates a deep and intimate knowledge in many diverse fields. Only a modern Renaissance person could realize the connections and write this book.     Heraclitus should have said you cannot read the same book twice. I read this book in the early eighties and it astounded me. I had the same impression reading it twenty years later.  Although this book is well written, because of the subject matter it is not always light reading.  It is helpful to have a pencil ready to work out the logic problems. The artwork must be viewed and the related concepts considered. A second reading of this book has spurred me onto purchasing his other books.	2001-05-01

Most people in survival situations are there without choice,  Armando Validares along with a segment of Cuban society were imprisoned because they valued their freedom of thought in a Cuban society intolerant of dissent.  These political prisoners have only to accept the garb of a common prisoner or attend political re-education classes to receive better treatment. The author and fellow prisoners endured inhumane tortures because of their belief and values. The prisoners have maintained their courage, defiance, and solidarity for years while undergoing all that Castro's regime can bear upon them to make them yield.  It is truly heroic. During many of the beatings the prisoners would still manage to yell an anti-communist slogan or quote a Bible verse to the enraged guards.  This book demonstrates the willpower a human being has to value an idea or goal above life itself. The ordeal, while completed by the author is continuing for many of his comrades and fellow citizens.  Other interesting aspects of this book show a wider view of the struggle such as, the  inner workings of the Castro regime, and highlights the deception of  his political statements denying the existence of political prisoners.  It also shows the force of world opinion and organizations such as the UN and Amnesty International upon Totalitarian governments. All in all, the main effect of this book was a deep admiration for these prisoners holding to a principle while enduring all that a modern totalitarian government can bring to bear upon them.  These men routinely have the basics of life withheld, clothing, warmth, food, water, and sleep, but still they endure and refuse to buckle under. They remain true to their conscience.  Common criminals and civilians employed in the prisons routinely are touched enough to help these political prisoners because their condition is so pathetic.  The Castro Regime's answer to this is to have these prisoners isolated and tended to by militant party members only.   Still threads of news managed to reach the outside world to inform it of the existence of these political prisoners and their actions.  The fact that this has gone on and is continuing close to American shores really hits home.  This book is now my standard for judging all other survival books.   I give it the highest rating.  Very well done. It is a story that had to be told.  World notoriety made it very unlikely that the author could quietly die in a Cuban prison and world appeals to release him finally made Castro relent.  This is his story of twenty-two years in the Cuban penal system.	2001-04-17

Its main problem is that it stopped short of attaining this goal. Coming as it does on the verge of the third decade of America's realization that the American Production System is not the ultimate manufacturing system it highlighted manufacturing problems, but not their solutions.  The idea behind the book was excellent. Building a neighborhood project within a  close neighborhood highlighted problems with the common American Mfg. system. It allowed one to easily attain the concept and the Japanese catch-word that defines the solution.  If you want a book that will help you relate catch-words this is it.  If you are interested in a solution, search elsewhere.  It needs a little further development on the reverse side of the coin. Such as the following week the group should have had a project at Ralph's or Sato's garage and with the same style demonstrate how the project should have been handled.    I did not like this book because it is only one side of the story. It offers nothing on the problem solving or &quot;How to&quot; side of manufacturing.	2001-04-04
