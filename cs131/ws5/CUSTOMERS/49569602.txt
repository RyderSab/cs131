This is a great book not so much emphasizing religion as spirituality. Borg states God can be experienced in many different ways through many different religions, though he focuses on Judaism/Christianity because they are his field of study. The historial information is also key to this book. Many of us confuse early Christian doctrine (set around the middle ages) as to the doctrine around the time of Jesus and this couldnt be further from the truth. Overall, excellent book	2005-08-12

This book was defintely one of those books you laughed out loud to. It isnt a serious vampire book, which you can tell by the cover, but the plotline is completely unique and easy to get into. I recommend this for anyone looking for a good laugh. But be warned, it is a chick book.	2005-08-12

I thought the set-up of this book was extremely helpful in illustrating what Borg was discussing. However, I think I had hoped this would be more of a \\"heart-felt\\" novel. I understand Borg had to get in all the historical information about Jesus (and he did an incredible job at that) but I had hoped he would speak of Jesus on more of an emotional level. I felt as I was more of an outsider looking in on the life of Jesus rather than a comrade right next to him. And perhaps that is the effect Borg wanted. All in all, a great book with great information. What I found most interesting in this whole book was the link between Jesus and Sophia (wisdom). Borg makes an excellent point to contrast the \\"Son of God\\" image of Jesus by saying Jesus was personified as Wisdom- a feminine term in Greek. He does this to stress the many metaphors used when defining Jesus and says we must not take them literally. All in all a great read with great information.	2005-08-12

Douglass Adams' \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" is one of the most amusing books I have ever read and if I were just to rate a book on soley humor, this would have probably gotten five stars. The plotline of space travel is unique and fascinating. Tis book also tries to answer life's big questions in a very humorous, light-hearted fashion. One big problem I had with the book was the very abrupt ending that not only caught me by surprise, but was very anti-climatic. Also, there were some fascinating characters that we were superically introduced to that I wish the author had explored a little more. Overall a very enjoyable read, yet had some key elements missing.	2005-08-01

Despite this there was very little character development (although this is usually the case with fast-paced suspense novels) and no overall lasting impression. In the end, when the killer was announced I was thinking \\"Wait who is that?\\" If the killer was mentioned in the beginning of the novel he was long forgotten. The thrill would have been a lot better had the killer been a character we had known on at least a superfical level where the shock would have been \\"Oh it's him! I would have never guessed.\\" Despite this, the process to discovering the killer was very suspenseful and compelling. Overall a good read.	2005-07-25

Dr. Duff presents good evidence coming from within the text itself, as well as social and economic information about the time period. Dr. Duff believes John's main opponent (and thus the main focus of the entire text) is Jezebel, a woman prophet who takes a more liberal stance on Christianity and who probably has a larger following than John. The only key criticism I would offer is that the name \\"Jezebel\\" is only present one time in the entire book of Revelation. Yet Dr. Duff's argument is well argued for, for John clearly does not want to alienate his readers by attacking a figure that appears to be well-liked and thus he attacks her behavior and stances without actually mentioning her name more than once. Overall a good piece of academic scholarship that sheds new light on the obscure text of Revelation.	2005-07-19

This book, although clearly fictious, raised a lot of poignant questions concerning human meaning and purpose to the point of being disturbing. Victor Frankenstein was portrayed, not as a helpless man who accidently created a monster, but as an evil-doer whose purpose and aim in creating the \\"New Race\\", similar to that of Huxley in \\"Brave New World.\\" All in all an interesting novel that seemed to get a lot of its ideas from Shelley's novel although creatively distanced itself from her confine. There was one part of the book I did not see the relevance of- the part concerning Roy Pribeaux. He seems to take up a good deal of the first half of the novel and if his soul purpose was just to introduce the character of Harker, it seems a bit unneccessary. I do not plan on reading the second novel in Koontz's series but, as expected, the ending was not an ending at all but an introduction to the second book, so dont expect much. All in all a quick enjoyable read that does have its scintillating parts. <br />	2005-07-09

Many times I would pause during a particular chapter and ask \\"Why does Crossan think that?\\" and I found many of my answers in \\"A Long Way from Tipperary.\\" This memoir describes how Crossan's upbringining contributed to his analysis of the historical Jesus. It is the genuinity and extreme honesty with which Crossan speaks that makes this memoir truly memorable. I especially liked the parts when Crossan would describe an event in his life and compare it to the life of Jesus and ask how it influenced his conclusions on Jesus- I would have liked to see more of this for it was truly insightful. I also woudl have liked to see more of discussion on his faith in God- he makes the point that he doenst use human logic to prove God's existence yet doenst really seem to describe how he arrived at his conclusion. Overall a great read into a fascinating mind.	2005-06-19

Lewis has devised a humorous, satircal novel; yet also one that sadly and painfully hits close to home. He has cleverly and novelly set up his book as a series of letters that the \\"Devil\\" writes to his nephew who is learning the trade. Many of the tactics used by the Devil become painfully clear to the reader and provokes deep thinking and questioning. Overall many letters contained strong, learning themes yet the overall presentation of ideas, although creative and unique, may have contributed to the overall lack of unity in the novel. I felt it read more like an essay than a novel. Overall though, the ideas were strong and poignant and stimulated thinking yet the setup perhaps hindered the developemnt of lasting impressions from the novel. As you read it, you gained insight, yet because the points were stated and then immdietely abandonded, it is hard to imagine this novel as leaving deep impressions in the mind.	2005-05-28

Every once you take a break from reading those intellecutally driven books and read something just for the sake of reading it. This book was enjoyable in that sense. It didnt stimulate any deep thinking but it was relaxing in the fact that you could just read something without looking for any hidden meaning. All the characters in this book are considered \\"drop dead gorgeous\\" and have mind controlloing powers and perfectly sculpted bodies. They also constantly have sex. Although not too realistic, Sherrilyn Kenyon has created a novel that was fun to read. And contrary to most trashy romance novels, this story actually had a very interesting, unique plot!	2005-05-12

The last 1/4 of the book was pretty decent; it was a clever idea for a novel yet somehow it didn't come out right. The acutal \\"Eyre Affair\\" wasnt as main a part of the book as you would expect. The first half of the book was slow paced background that had little pertience to the plot. To make the book better, Fforde should have expanded the Jane Eyre part of the novel and perhaps made Thursday Next's stay in Eyre-land longer with more episodes. I just was amazed that the title had little to do with the book. I expected more from this book because the unique plot line appealed to me.	2005-02-27

He will take care of you. Don't rely on your own strength and wisdom, but rather, His. No matter how painful an event in our life is, it is there for a reason. Usually, it brings us closer to God because we are forced by our weakness to come to Him for strength. I truly recommend this book to anyone who is hurting and who is dissatisfied with life. I also really enjoyed the quotes written before each chapter that serve as a preview of the lesson to be learned in that chapter.	2004-12-20

It was a unique plot that consisted of a public defender lawyer making it big through illegal means. The book contained subtle bits of humor that made it much more enjoyable. The character of Clay was very likeable and relatable. At times I felt the book was too dragged out and could have been shortened. Also the ending was a bit too predictable and uneventful when compared to the rest of the novel. I had kind of hoped that Clay would have returned to his old job and tried to protect those he had wrongly accused of murder. Overall though, an enjoyable read	2004-12-05

Yes it contains a lot of lewd porn, but that might not have been so bad had there actually been a storyline to this novel. There was no character development (except for the minor character development concerning the character of Marcelle) and a lack of character analysis. My second problem with this book is the revolting scences. Pissing on others is not something most people find erotic and neither are many of the other scences. The author seems childish, immmature and very underdeveloped. Of course there is also the possiblity that I just dont understand what he is trying to prove or say.	2004-10-20

The reader feels a sense of unity and family yet at the same time is horrifed by some of their practices. This part of the novel was very informative yet at times it read like a history textbook- I didnt find myself getting that much into it. There should have been more character analysis. The book starts to climax at the time the colonials arrive and bring their teachings of Christianity. I felt around this part Achebe should have focused more on the conversion of Okonkwo's son- Nwoye. I would be interested to know what made him convert and how he felt about the white man's treatment of his tribe. I felt Achebe could have covered the more complicated issues concerning this issue; it is not simply a black and white issue. The book focused too much on soely Okonkwo and ignored many of the other characters with very contrasted personality traits; it would have been interesting to do more of a character cross-anaylsis on the women in the tribe and those that decided to follow Christinaity instead of focusing just on one character. Overall though, a thought-provoking book dealing with a very difficult issue.	2004-10-17

I felt that with such an ingenious plot, the story would have been much more thrilling and less repetitive than it was. The ending of this novel was very incomplete and made the reader wonder what the last 250 pages were for. The whole search, the whole mission, the whole reason for the book seemed lost in the unclimatic ending. There was a great feeling of unaccomplishment at the end.	2004-09-28

Greed, selfishness, and egotism are praised and guilt, sacrifice, and pain are denounced. We are taught to never live our lives for anyone else, nor expect others to live their lives for us. The world belongs to those who take it. Yet there was an issue in this novel that was very difficult to battle with. If the world cheats you out of what you fully deserve, what your mind has created, and what your hands have molded, should you in fact leave the world? Should you leave your creation behind and give up on mandkind? The story's main character battles with this issue for quite some time. The main question of this novel boils down to what would you tell him if you saw Atlas, the carrier of the world, struggling so hard to carry the weight of the earth and yet the harder it stuggled the more the world bore heavily down upon his shoulders....You would tell him to shrug. You would tell him not to care about the world anymore; to leave the place where he is unwanted. This was an excellent book with many life lessons intertwined in a simplistic plot. If I had any criticism to offer it would be that a lot of superflous, repetitive paragraphs were inserted in the novel to bulk it up. I felt the novel could be shortened by about 200 pages. I also felt the ending to be anti-climaxal. I expected this exuberant feeling at the end; a feeling of success and contentment but all I felt was a distant lonliness and sadness. Yet that perhaps was the most realistic ending. Overall a good read if you are into hardcore philosophy and want to learn a new approach to life and how to battle its difficulties.	2004-08-24

This book accurately portrays the ups and downs of romance and the essentiality of compromise in a successful relationship. Although the theme of the book was enjoyable I found many parts supericial and lacking in depth. Concerning Nola and Gabriel Carr, the transition from annoyance and irratation to &quot;falling in love&quot; is very abrupt and rushed. One minute they couldnt tolerate each other and the next they cant stop thinking of each other. It did not seem realistic because they hadnt really gotten to know each other well.

Yet around the middle, when each character was explored at a deeper level, the story began to get interesting. The ending was extremeley disturbing; you definitely finish this novel feeling unfulfilled, like the story isnt finished. Characters you initally hated, you begin to love; characters you initally loved you end up hating. Very twisted ending but an overall unresolved feeling.	2004-05-15

This book had a very catchy opening and continued its humor untill the very end. There are actual times in the book where the reader will laugh out loud. It is so candid and sincere and very relatable. The only negative I would comment about is the ending.

Yes this book was exciting yet I dont think it had the true horror that exists in most of King's novels. I must say though, I truly enjoyed the last chapter very much. It made a lot of great, horrifying  points about humanity in general. There were also a couple of other short stories by Matheson in this book. I did not feel any of them were up to the same caliber as &quot;I am Legend.&quot; &quot;Prey&quot; and &quot;Mad House&quot; were somewhat unique yet overall short stories do not appear to be Matheson's forte. Overall this book was unique in its plot and an enjoyable read	2004-02-15

I was amazed at the actul depth this novel carried. All characters were multidimensional with inner conflicts that made them seem human instead of fiction. Another great aspect of the novel concerned the heavily debated topic of theology and acceptance of another's religion. The reader becomes so heavily involved in the story and starts to feel real sorrow and pity for the characters involved. I somehow felt the ending was a little weak but perhaps that is what happens when all the characters grow old an loose their childlike innocence and fervor. Unrequitted and unattainable love seem to be two major themes in this novel aside from there religious debate. Overall this novel contained a lot of depth and aside from its ficticious nature, a lot situations many can relate to. The setting also plays a huge part in the novel. Marion Simmer Bradley does an excellent job with description in this novel.	2004-01-10

The idea of poltergeist attacks sounded interesting to me but this book focused more on the sour relationships between the Democrats and Republicans in office than the acutal poltergeist attacks (which were more of a side note).

US	49569602	R1MCHIBY8H7MR0	0345405641	95741719	Breakthroughs	Books	2	1	4	N	N	drawn out novel	This was the first time I had read an alternate history novel. The idea behind it was fine yet Turtledove switched so much between differnt stories that no one story had much depth and feeling to it. The mini stories, though trying to get a feel from all sides of a war, were superfically set up. There were some characters i wanted Turtledove to go more depth in and others i felt he could have elimintated. The ending of the novel was were the climax was for most characters. I also didnt like how at the end a lot of characters were left hanging. Overall I wasnt that pleased with the way Turtledove wrote about the experiences of war.	2002-01-28

The chapters always end with page turners and every time you think the characters have nailed a mystery or a suspect the author keeps on tricking you. Reich is a very smart author who is a forsensic antropologist just as her character is. This makes the book all the more interesting becuase you know that the methods they use to solve cases is actual. Read this book if you like complex yet fun mysterys.	2001-08-30

It was also a bit confusing because it switched narratives alot and didnt make it clear especially becuase the father and son had similar names. The book just didnt appeal to me. It was a little shallow and uninteresting. It was slow to begin and slow to end. There was basically no action in this book.	2001-08-12

The first 30 pages were hard to get into but after that it was easy reading. The ending of the novel was a little disturbing but it was so keenly written that the author deserves so much credit for it. If u like thoughtful haunting books read it!	2001-08-12

The novel went by so quick and the scences were perfectely detailed. I found Yost, the murderer, to be a very interesting character.

Also the very ending was rushed althogh the action beforehand was excellent. The middle of the book was where the action started so the beginning half was just a bunch of boring info. The ending left you very empty. Overall I didnt really get a feel about the book, it just came and went yet it does leave you with some intense scenes	2001-06-18

It is quite different from the original version yet contained more thrilling events. The beginning was a little slow but the last couple chapters wizzed by. The original story was short and could have elaborated more on the last scene to make it better. All in all it was a good novel	2001-05-27

She has much originality yet doesnt spend much time explaing the key aspects of the novel. There were some parts that while reading it and trying to understand it was thrilling but as i look back i wont remember any of it because they author didnt explain. The ending was also a little weak. A little more detail was needed in this book	2001-05-08

It rushed the intense scenes and left the readering feeling indifferent at the end. Louis Duncan did do a good job creating a variety of differnt characters with different personalites but did not develop them very well. I would not recommend this book.	2001-04-20

Some scenes actually leave your eyes glued to the page hungry for more. This book at a unique plot; one that i had never read about. Those looking for something different and exciting look no further. Diana Galbaldon is a spectacular writer. Her characters become your friends and once the book is over you feel a empty space inside. Since this book was long i was accustomed to reading it every night and when it was over i felt sad. That is how you know it was a good book.	2001-04-05

This book combines the aspects of mystery, humor, and suspense to create a fascinating novel.

The pace picks up toward the middle and devolops a decent ending. I felt Fitzgerald could have been more manifest in the book's overall meaning and sumed up the general meaning in fewer words. This book is not all it's hyped up to be yet a decent novel. I might have enjoyed the book a little more if it hadn't been put up on such a high pedestal. If you decide to read this novel, dont go into it with high expectations. However the author does do a good job of tying the book up together in an organized fashion.	2001-02-24

I've heard about Stephen King writing fantastic books and wanted to see for my self how good this author really is. I chose &quot;The Green Mile&quot; because I heard heard the movie was great. I havent seen the movie yet but the book was excellent. It opened my eyes to all the injustices going on in the world. King used many writing techniques includeing forshadowing and flashbacks. The whole story was just set up beautifully. i read this 536 page novel in about 11 days! I wouldnt recommend it if you've seen the movie. The element of suspense is vital to the enjoyment of this book. It will bring tears to your eyes.	2001-02-15
