He has finished the last of four volumes of his systematic theology. Like the first three of the series the layout of the book is the same. At the end of almost every chapter he gives you quotes from the eary church and the medevil church and the reformation. Also it's very apologetic. In this last volume he gives his view about the church and the end times. Dr. Geisler is a dispensationist. He is pre- trib and pre-Mill in his view of the end times. He also talks about church govt and the gifts of the spirit and touches on the issue of tongues. This book is great from the dispensational view point and I give it 5 stars and a book I would recommend. Having said all that, he made some errors. I hope that Dr. Geisler will correct the errors because it is misrepresentation at best and have his chapter on the tribulation redone. In that chapter he talks about preterism. He mention 4 people and rightly explains the different camps in preterism. The problem is ( I don't know this happen being a book by Geisler) he misrepresent two preterist. He makes mention that Full pretersim is a hersey and rightly so. Partial preterism is okay in the Church. He puts Gary Demar and R.C. Sproul in this camp. Which is where they belong. He goes on to mention two more guys and put them in the full preterism camp. Anorld Chilton and Kenneth Gentry. This is errror and make Dr. Geisler look bad. He already misrepresents Calvinism. Now going on to misrepresent Preterism.  <br />Arnold Chilton was a partial preterist all his life until a heart attack then change his position to a full position after that. A Few months later he died. From my understanding he didn't write a book from this position. Dr. Gentry is a partial preterist and the best advocator for this position today. He was the one to influnce R.C. Sproul to this very position. Dr. Gentry already wrote to the pub to have this change and to forward this to DR. Geisler and I hope that Gielser changes in the next edition.  <br /> <br />Good work except for the errors.	2005-10-08

He is a Calvinist and a reformed theologian. In this book he sets out to explain what his theological background is. So the first half of the book he explains what the foundation of Reformed Theology is which is based in GOD himself. The second half deals with what is controversy today in the Christian church a doctrine that people often misunderstand and misrepresnt. The doctrine known as Calvinism or TULIP. Many people and scholar( Norman Geisler) and authors like Dave Hunt and George Byrson and also Hank Hanegraaff often misrepresent Calvinism. In this book R.C. Sproul explains it well.

I read a couple of his books years ago and heard tapes of him at different speaking areans and I like dave Hunt. Over the years I didn't read him as much for no bad reason until I heard about the Calvinism attack. James White ( I must admit... a theologian I admire) James White's books and tapes have help me as a apologist. I have just finished \\"The Potter's Freedom\\" by james White and \\"the Pleasure of God\\" by John Piper and having been a Calvinist by default in my early years as a Christian, then becoming a arminian, I have come back to Calvinism. Reading this book like other reviewers have noted, Dave Hunt does in fact represent the arminian view (even though he says that he is not one, just like Norman geisler) If you wanted to read a debate on Calvinism this isn't a bad start. James White does lay down the doctrines of Grace in a clear fashion. James defends Calvinism with a clear presentation. Dave Hunt who is a famous author and speaker and has sold millions of copies of his books in different countries is really no match for James White. The first part of the book, James White starts by makeing a opening statement and then Dave Hunt tries to refute it, then James defends, then dave rebutes, and final remark by James white. It goes like that all the way through Calvinism TULIP. The P in TULIP is not addressed until the end of the book because they both agree with it, just disagree on who has a better biblical rason to hold on to eternal secruity. The second Dave Hunt does his thing in the same fashion as Dr. White did in the first half of the book. A lot of bad in the book mainly due to Dave Hunt's presentation. I have just came back to Calvinism , even if I was still arminian, while I may have agree with some of the arguements of Hunt, I would say that White does a better job.    In the book, Hunt not only repeats the errors over and over andover again. It seems like Hunt doesn't even listen to the other side of the debate. Hunt brings up things that don't even make a big deal in the debate. Hunt jumps all over the place in his arguementation. Also Hunt admits he doesn't know Greek, yet he trys to use Greek not only in word but in Grammatical construction .Why? He doesn't know Greek. He made himself look really bad, he wasn't the guy to write this book. After reading this book, you know why Dave Hunt ( even though he said he would) won;t debate James  White. White would shame him so bad in the cross examination part, I think Hunt would shake in his boots. I was about 20 page from being done with the book and I decided to call the Dividing line ( James White's radio show) and we talked about this and when I mention that I was reading the book and almost finished, James cut in and said \\" I'm sorry\\" I thought something happen and I said that okay. He said\\" No, I said I'm sorry because you are reading the book\\" Because he told the original pub that Dave Hunt wouldn't stay on the topics of the debate. He was right.     I'm sure james White would say to those who would and have read this book. :I'm sorry\\"     great job James white this book gets five stars for a great presentation of Calvinism. The book should be burn because of Dave Hunt.	2005-09-14

This book is a great book for those who want to know more about God's pleasures in creation, election, salvation, etc. It's a good book on learning Reform theology if you don't have a clue what Reform theology is. This book has shifted my theological position on freewill, now to in brace Calvinism. We as Christian's can have great comfort in knowing that God is in control of our lives, even in trials and heart ache. While finishing this book and waiting for my car to be fixed. i had met a guy walking down the street. He passed by and I thought, I should have witnessed to him. If God would want me to, he come back. Well the guy stopped about 15 feet from me and came back to asked me about my tattoos on my arm. As I witnessed to him, he asked what was the point of God making us and putting us here? For his good pleasure.........This is a great book. <br /> <br />Great work Dr. Piper	2005-09-06

I thought this book is going to be about psychology but it wasn't. I read this book because it was recommended by a book called \\"False Intimacy: Understanding the Struggle of Sexual Addiction (Paperback) by Harry W. Schaumburg\\" <br />The book is from a christian world view, and claims that the problems with people isn't mental disorder but the problems is from a fallen nature as the bible said. He also goes on to talk about the fact that we often try to use common sayings in the Christian world to sovle our problems, when they really don't. Some Christians will say that if your struggling with emotional problems, just study more, attend bible study and do all other kinds of Christian's duty to make things better. You can also ask the Holy Spirit to take your problems away. Why all these are good, sometimes Christians don't get to the root of the problem because of the image Christians try to protray that nothing is wrong. The one thing that I find that is helpful about the book is that, he does write that rather than asking God to take problems and past hurts away, ask hin to get you through it. Even if the pain is hurtful, like a cheating spouse, or divorce etc. While this is not what the world teaches us, the Scripture tell us that God is in control. Great book...	2005-09-01

After reading and finding out James R White held the same position. I still hold that position. One thing that we must remember is just because you might see the abuses of each of the positions in real life. Doesn't make them invaild.

This book is for all who want to know about sexual addictions and how to deal with it. If you have a sexual addiction, this book will help you understand the addiction and get the help you need. If you have been hurt by a spouse who has a sexual addiction, this book will help also. But this book will help all people because all of us have been decieved by false intimacy, married or not. The best part of this book is the fact that the author tells it like it is. Sexual addiction comes from the heart of all people, which the Word of God tells us that it's evil. This book is biblical in it's understanding of humans, and it's persecptives on this issue. He points people to come to the Lord, and that he is the only one that can cure the root of all evil, the human heart. The gospel is preached and the misconceptions in the Christian church is addressed. The only problem with this book, is theolocially he errs in one line. When he siad that God became sin for us, while I understand what he was getting at. He use the wrong choices of worlds, for Jesus didn't become sin, he was the sin bearer, not sin itself. Thus, every Christian who is involed in ministry for this stuff, like Christian counselors etc. should read this book. Lay person as well. All who desire real intimacy with anyone, husband with wife, father and son, etc. Great book I plan to read it again and in the future.. <br />If you want your marriage to step to the next level, even if you don't have a sexual addiction, you still may be living in a false intimacy, even if you been married 20 years. It can help your marriage and your family. It gives you tips of how to raise your kids not to have false understanding of relationships with people and with their family's. Everyone can be better informed if you read this book. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-06

It is a debate that goes back to the 5th century. DR. James R White sets out to prove that Calvinsim is biblical and dead on theologically consistent. While refuting Dr. Norman Geisler, fame apologist of the Christian world, and his position on \\"FREE WILL\\". While I admire both men, and both men have help me in becoming involed in apologetics and counter cult ministry over the years. I have read Dr. Geisler's Chose but Free about a year or two ago. A position that I had agree with to some degree. Being a Calvinist by default, in my early years as a Christian, then changing my view to a what Dr. Geisler calls a moderate Calvinist.(Not because of Geisler) I also just finishing reading Dr. Geisler systematic theology on SIN and SALVATION which alot of his free will views are there.   With all that being said, I think that DR. White ( The Great White of apologetics) refutes Dr. Geisler clearly through great documentions about who Geisler quotes incorrectly or not fully and his lack of going at the texts of scripture exegetically as one would expect from Dr. Norman Geisler. This book was great.     I do think that there is a misconception about the book. Alot of people think that you need to read Geisler book first. That's probably the most logical thing you should do. Since Dr. White is trying to refute Dr. Geisler, thus you must know what Dr. Geisler said. I don't think you have to read Geisler book if you wanted to learn about Calvinism, you could go at this book. Because you will seen the objections throw at Calvinism and how it's defended and defined.     One last note: James White set the record clearly and correctly. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A MODERATE CALVINIST OR EXTREME CLAVINIST.     Great job done...	2005-07-27

In this book, Mr. Dalcour defines the biblical doctrine of the Holy Trinity. He also defines the Oneness view in both historical context and today's version of modalism. His exegesis of the Holy writ is that of a scholar, his passion is that of someone who loves Truth, and wants that share with others. So many great features of this book. Mr. Dalcour looks at the great church fathers, on their view of the Godhead, which was the Trinity. Mr. Dalcour also refutes the main man in Oneness pentecostal today, David Bernard. In the end, this book not only defines oneness theology, but teaches you the Trinity. It is two books in one if you will. The last chapter contains something about the Trinity, about how to discuss the Trinity and show Christians that when they first believe in Jesus, they belived in the Trinity. A Classic indeed.

Chapter 31 says that the experts say it's impossible to read over 900 wpm. The author says that many people have read over that, and it's possible to read 700-1500 wpm. I took the test twice, I read 1278 wpm. So everything in the book I already do. So the book didn't help get faster, but it did tell how fast I read and understand the content of the stuff I'm reading. So, if what I already do, is a way of working to make you read faster, good. the book was written in a readable style.	2005-04-06

While I see some of the people who wrote bad reviews about this book has really know anything about the subject. Some say that Hank Hanegraaff take some of these guys out of context, you need to get the audio tape version of this book which you can hear these guys promote their false teachings. Great book. In this book Hank Hanegraaff documents the false teaching of many T.V. preachers on TBN. Guys like Benny Hinn, Kenneth Copeland, Fred Price, and a host of others including Paul Crouch who is the head of TBN. He documents their false teaching and their misrepresentation of Christ. He shows his readers what the Word of Faith theology is and why it's so dangerous. This is a great resource on this kind of movement.      If you want something on Benny Hinn to watch, get the DVD the Many faces of Benny Hinn. It contains some of the false teaching and crazy sayings from Hinn, and you can see him saying it. These saying are documented in the book and tapes.    Great Job Bible Answer Man	2005-04-06

Books	5	13	19	N	N	The best on the KJV only position	I read this book many years ago and I think it's the best on this position. I like the fact that Dr. White takes the time out to show you the different kinds of KJV advocates there are. Dr. White starts out with this in his book. He also expose the wrong reasoning among the KJV only guys and the misconception about translating and the greek text that is used by the modern translations.  Great Job.    Update: I have been going through this book again and there are alot of good things in this book. For one thing is that Dr. White goes into a lot of history about the Greek text and how it came to us. He talks about the \\"Art and Science \\" of textual criticism. Goes into the TR used by the KJV advocates for their arguments for why the KJV is the best text. Yet the KJV only position doesn't give all the fact, misrepresents the other side and history as well. Not only to mention that the KJV that we have now not only differs from the 1611 version but is differs from one another. You can buy a KJV from one PUB and by one from another or the same people and the text might differ. This book is great for those who want to learn about manuscript history and textual criticism in a layman style dealing with the KJV, this is a great start.	2005-04-01

Hank is loved and hated by many, but he is a very clear thinker. In this book he exposes some of these things that are suppose to be the new movement of the Spirit. It shows that the teachers and preacher in the movement misuse and out abuse the Holy Writ to prove there point. Rather that having Scriptures dictate what the church do in seeking   revival, they let all kinds of things dictate it. I always, anytime in this day and age, you see a big tend of some sort in the church, it's probably not of God. Why? Because most Christians today are biblically illiterate. I never follow Christians because they are Christians, they probably don't know what they are following. <br /> <br />Good Job Hank	2005-02-11

I wish I had this book when I first started reading the book of Revelation. It gives you the 4 views of Revelation from the position of the Church. Preterism , Futurism, Historcism amd Idealism. Most Christians when learning about the end times for the first time, today never get the views to choose for themselves. I was taught futurism  ( Pre-Trib) by most of the churches I went to.

I have own two copies of this book in the last 4 years. This book also jump started my passion for learning Greek. James White THD. as written a book on one of the essential doctrines of the historic Christian faith, namely the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. The book is not as detailed as Robert Morey's book on the Trinity. I think both book are great to read together. Morey goes into issues that White doesn't go into, and White goes into some things Morey doesn't go into. Some people who reviews start attacking the Trinity from a theologial and historical position might not understand that the position of Jesus being created or not God was not taught until the 4th century. Like if you read the booklet by Jehovah Witness called \\"Should you believe in the Trinity\\" it gives you the ideal that the early church didn't believe in the Trinity, which is not true. I often ask two questions to Jehovah witness and that is 1) If they know that the position they hold was invented in the 4th century as well as the creed of the Trinity?. 2) Also that the booklet in english \\"Should you believe the Trinity\\" doesn't have information about where they got the qoutes from. But the Italian version of the booklet does show where they got it from? because in Italy the Watchtower had to put where they got the quotes from, while in the state they didn't have too. I wonder why? Dr.White as done a great job on the Trinity. <br /> <br />God Bless	2004-11-12

The book not only helps you with putting the book of revelation in the right context, but the book gives you the gospel, atonement,end times, defence of the resurrection and other doctrine in the bible.
