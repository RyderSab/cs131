From the charming but conniving Starbuck in N. Richard Nash's classic play `The Rainmaker,' to Milo Minderbinder, the larcenous Army Mess Officer in Joseph Heller's `Catch 22,' there's just something about a smooth-talking swindler.<br /><br />Jack Payne's new novel, Six Hours Past Thursday, brings a new face to the pantheon of tricksters.  Move over Henry Gondorff, here comes Steve Draves.  Steve has it all: a beautiful wife, wonderful children, a fat bank account, and the sort of best friend that he can trust with his life.  What more could a man want?  In Steve's case - everything.  More money, more booze, and every attractive woman who crosses his path.  Steve is the master of the tricky deal, and a maestro of the doublecross.  It's amazing to watch him work, as he skims, squeezes and strong arms his way to a fortune, all without ever quite breaking the law.  Everything is going great until the mob gets involved...<br /><br />Jack Payne brings a lifetime of exceptional business acumen to this novel, and his insider knowledge comes through in the details of every shady deal.  His writing is smooth, engaging, and deceptively powerful.  But you won't recognize the true nature of Jack Payne's skill until you realize that you love Steve Draves, even as you're compiling your list of reasons to despise him.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2005-01-17

Cryptonomicon is fairly brimming with useful advice.  Thinking about dating the daughter of a homicidal ex-Navy Seal?  It's in the book.  Have you suddenly found yourself doing business with a lawsuit-happy dentist with masochistic streak?  It's in here.  Need to know the optimum procedure for eating Captain Crunch cereal?

Unfortunately, Lynne Truss sometimes takes her self-appointed role as a `stickler' to unpleasant extremes.  It's one thing to be a purist, and quite another thing to be a literary fascist.  Perhaps her humor goes farther over the top than I'm comfortable with, but some of her more pointed rants seem more cruel than playful.<br /><br />I found her diatribe on the 9/11 attacks to be more than a bit unsettling.  Many newscasters used the word `enormity' to describe the scope of the tragedy; according to Ms. Truss, they should have used the word `magnitude.'  While thousands of families mourned the loss of their loved ones, Ms. Truss was apparently more troubled by poor word choice than by human suffering on a national scale.  For the record, I happen to believe that `enormity' was the correct word.  `Magnitude' quantifies only size, rank, or extent.  `Enormity,' although often misused as a synonym for `magnitude,' refers to monstrous offense, evil, or outrage.  To my mind, all of those words are appropriate in the context of the 9/11 attacks.  They convey the nature of terrorism much more surely than a word that pertains only to matters of scale.<br /><br />Lynne Truss manages to teach, scold, joke, and cajole - all within the pages of the same book.  I can't help but be impressed.  That she has pushed a grammar book to the Bestseller list is even more impressive.  As a writer and lover of words, I wanted to cherish this book, but its playful spirit disappears too often behind condescension and intolerance.  As a consequence, I love parts of the book.  I don't care for other parts at all.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2005-01-04

It very nearly defies description.  The closest I can come is to say that I know magic when I see it, and this is magic.  Mayland Long is an enigmatic oriental gentleman who just might be the human incarnation of a Chinese Dragon.  Martha MacNamara is a fiftyish woman who plays fiddle in an Irish jig band, and she just may be the Zen master that Mayland Long has been waiting for.  Together, they unravel a mystery that makes San Francisco of the nineteen-eighties seem as sinister and magical as any land ever depicted in a fantasy novel.  Tea With the Black Dragon was written twenty years ago, so the computer technology is severely dated, but that doesn't really detract from the story.

Tag along with Case, Molly, and Dixie Flatline as they careen through a distopian future, where real life is an approximation of cyberspace, and the only signposts are written in Gibson's trademark prose.  This book has been copied and rehashed so many times that it will probably seem familiar, even if you've never read it.  But `Neuromancer' is the source.  Every major idea in the cyberpunk/technogoth genre started with this book.  To call `Neuromancer' brilliant would be six kinds of understatement.

I think I was expecting a trashy romance novel with a cursory Vietnam Prisoner of War theme thrown in for flavor.

Code of Conduct follows the career of a Navy fighter pilot from the downing of his aircraft in 1966, through seven years of torture and solitary confinement in the infamous Hanoi Hilton prison camp, to his return to America and his family.  But, after seven years of clinging to the dream, his homecoming is not at all what he expects.

He's not going to get a free ride either, as an unscrupulous Middle Eastern leader takes advantage of America's temporary weakness to launch a major military offensive against his neighboring nations.  Before Jack has a chance to get his bearings, he's faced with a war in the gulf region, a kidnap/murder attempt on his own children, and a biological warfare attack on the United States.  That should be enough to keep anyone busy, but Jack Ryan also finds himself battling the deposed former Vice President for control of the nation, not to mention an assasination plot within the Secret Service.<br /><br />It takes Tom Clancy a little while to get all the wheels spinning, but - once he does - this book turns into a juggernaut.  The military action is fierce and thoroughly exciting.  Faced with nearly overwhelming odds, the U.S. military must depend on high-tech weaponry and superior training and tactics to win the day.

Although I've met Mr. Blaylock on two or three occasions, I still can't make up my mind. In either case, this book is one of my very favorites. Only Blaylock would pit a delightfully quirky would-be Innkeeper like Andrew Vanbergen against the demonic Pennyman when the fate of the world hung in the balance. The plot, including its absurd references to the current street address of Judas Iscariot, is so wildly improbable that I have to suspect that it's true. This book is a must-read for anyone who's ever wondered if miracles and toaster ovens can co-exist in the same kitchen.

Probably best labeled as Contemporary Fantasy, many of his books paint a world of eccentric heroes and off-beat villains, locked into bizarrely-magical combat in suburban America.  'The Paper Grail' puts an entirely new twist on the grail legend.  Howard Barton, genial and somewhat bumbling curator, drives to Mendocino, California to acquire a 19th-century woodcut drawing for his museum's collection.  In the process, he hopes to mend fences with his childhood sweetheart, Sylvia, and recapture the spark of romance that's been missing from his life ever since.  Laying his hands on the drawing turns out to be a lot more difficult than he expects, and reconnecting with Sylvia isn't much easier.  Along the way, he stumbles into the middle of a quiet but desperately earnest battle over the Holy Grail.  To the keeper of the Grail goes incalculable power, and all the wrong people want it for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2004-12-05

This one is something special, though.  Not only was it his first, but it still ranks among his best.  Easily the best sea chase novel since 'Sink the Bismark,' Red October is one of the great cold war thrillers, if not the very best of the breed.  At a time when most military writers were portraying Soviet adversaries as trigger-happy maniacs, Clancy gave us Captain Marko Ramius.  A tactical genius and a master of submarine warfare, Ramius places sanity above national loyalty, and compassion above revenge.  With the world creeping toward nuclear apocalypse, he must purchase peace at the cost of treason.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2004-12-05

Not that I'm slamming the rest of them, but this one has it all:  mystery, adventure, espionage, with a dash of romance for seasoning.  At the height of the Cold War, America lives under the threat of nuclear attack by the Soviet Union.  A brilliant American scientist has designed a defensive shield that can make the U.S. invulnerable to nuclear attack.  To make it operational, he needs large quantities of a rare mineral.  Unfortunately, the only stockpile large enough went down with the Titanic.  To recover it, Dirk Pitt must bring the famously ill-fated ocean liner back to the surface.  He must raise the Titanic.  Needless to say, the Soviets aren't crazy about the idea.  They'll do anything to stop him, including send the Titanic back to her watery grave.  The story should feel dated, now that the Cold War has ended and the Titanic really has been discovered.  It doesn't, at least not to me.  'Raise the Titanic' is still a good old fashioned page-turner.

Although the fiendishly-difficult puzzles in the story aren't all that fiendish (or even particularly difficult), the plot moves like a runaway train.  Intrigue, murder, history, art, religion, and conspiracy...  What more could a reader ask for?  There's even a sex cult.  (Okay, it's a pagan fertility cult and the sex takes place off-camera, but it's the thought that counts.)  Dan Brown does a wonderful job bundling a series of diverse historical events into a coherent and believable story, populated with compelling characters.  The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and the bumbling cops are... well... bumbling.<br /><br />I'd love to give this book five stars, but I can't.  The historical `facts' are bent a bit too far for the sake of the story, and one recurring plot device reminded me unpleasantly of that trick that children love to play at Christmas: the large and colorfully wrapped box, which contains a smaller box, which contains a smaller box...  Although watching the victim open box after box seems endlessly entertaining to the 11 year old perpetrator of the gag, the game is a bit tiresome after the second box.  By the time you get to the last tiny box at the center, whatever present it contains will almost certainly fail to justify the effort.<br /><br />Those quibbles aside, however, `The Da Vinci Code' is a lot of fun.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2004-11-29

Death, revenge, betrayal, mysticism, and the eternal struggle between good and evil, all set against the backdrop of the apocalypse.  I remember thinking that Stephen King had nailed it down.

I reminded myself that they had probably been cut for a reason.  But I eventually broke down and bought the uncut version.  I half expected the story to bog down under the weight of additional pages.  It didn't.  The story was bigger and richer, but not at all weighed down.  Contrary to all my misgivings, the missing pages brought depth and detail that threw this powerhouse of a story into even sharper relief.  I was wrong, and so were Stephen King's editors.

Every time I turned a page, I found myself thinking 'This could have happened.'  I've read reviews by critics who seem to think that Roth's premise is unrealistic.  I want to believe them.  I want to believe that America is immune to the sort of racial oppression that Phillip Roth depicts.  But I know too much about our history as a nation to believe that we are beyond such.  As much as I love this country, I have to admit that it could have happened this way.<br /><br />In the America of Mr. Roth's alternative past, President Lindbergh handshake deal with Adolf Hitler, relegating American Jews to slow but systematic oppression.  The ovens and the gas chambers do not materialize on this side of the Atlantic, but the ever-compounding sense of fear that replaces them is almost as disturbing.<br /><br />This book is more than a gripping read.  It's an object lesson.  It's a reminder that our choices in national leadership can have consequences that far surpass our understanding.  America under Charles Lindbergh takes a quite different direction than under FDR's leadership.  It's also a reminder that one man can change the world, and not always for the better.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2004-11-29

Driven by their own megalomania and a desire to even the score for World War II, a handful of powerful Japanese industrialists goad their government into war with the United States.  The result is some of the best naval combat to hit the pages of fiction.<br /><br />I've heard it said that this book is too long.  I don't see how it could be shortened without chopping out the political arc of the story.  That would leave us with two powerful nations butting heads, and no real idea of how the conflict came about.  Some writers might be content with that.  Tom Clancy is not.  He knows that you cannot begin to understand any event or action until you understand the forces responsible for its creation.  How do nations plunge, leap, stumble, or blunder into war?  Mr. Clancy sheds light on the money, politics, ambition, and national pride that all factor into the equation.  So, yes, this book could be shorter.  But the story would suffer for it.  (On a personal note, I didn't notice the length of the book anyway.  I got so wrapped up that I burned through the book in no time.)<br /><br />Other critics love to pick apart the shifts in political and military allegiance that form the heart of this novel.  The unspoken assumption is obvious: `Everyone who is our ally today will also be our ally tomorrow.'  It's a comforting mindset; quite easy to swallow, as long as you're prepared to utterly disregard history.  The world changes.  Sometimes slowly, and sometimes with frightening rapidity.  As a retired Sailor and veteran of the Cold War, I can remember when everyone knew for a fact that the Soviet Union would never fall, short of nuclear annihilation.  The Berlin wall would stand forever.  Argentina would never be foolish enough to pick a fight with the United Kingdom.  Middle Eastern terrorists would never find their way to American soil.  Mr. Clancy built his story around a change in national alliances.  The particular power structure he postulated, has not come to pass.  Not yet, at least.  But he wasn't trying to predict the future.  He was trying to show that alliances can, and do shift, often with incredible consequences.

The action heats up about 100 pages in, and never lets up after that.  Middle Eastern terrorists sabotage the USSR's most productive oil fields, leaving the paranoid Soviet Politburo without the fuel needed to run their military and industry.  In a few months, when their stockpiles of oil begin to run low, they will become vulnerable to attack.  They decide to attack first, while they still have the fuel reserves to seize the upper hand.  The Soviet military hits NATO head-on, and the result is a slugfest in the air, on the ground, and at sea.  If you like military action, this book has got it in spades.<br />Red Storm Rising has gathered a lot of criticism from Armchair Generals, but I spent a decade and a half studying for, planning for, and training for war with the Soviet Navy, and I think Clancy did a better job with the subject than anyone else.  In hindsight, his descriptions of stealth aircraft were a little off the mark, but he made a lot of pretty shrewd guesses about a branch of technology that was still completely under wraps when he wrote the book.  Slow start and minor errors aside, Red Storm is a page-turner.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2004-11-17

In my twenty-three years of active duty, I served under quite a few Commanding Officers.  With one notable exception, they were all competent leaders, and several of them were excellent.  Two were extraordinary.  After reading his book, I can only conclude that Captain Abrashoff qualifies for the extraordinary category.  This is the kind of leadership that real Sailors pray for.  I sincerely wish I'd had the opportunity to serve under his command.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2004-11-12

McDaniel takes us from the builder's yard in Connecticut to white hot combat in the Pacific Theater.  McDaniel's writing has the human understanding of Edward L. Beach, and the technical precision of Tom Clancy.  Don't miss this one.  If you're a fan of naval combat novels, this is as good as it gets.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2004-11-09

As an earlier reviewer mentioned, Cobb's details are sometimes lacking, but overall he does a good job of capturing the flavor of life and combat aboard an ultra-modern warship.  For a guy who never served in uniform, Mr. Cobb writes with much better accuracy than I'd expect.  As a retired Navy Chief, I was frankly shocked by Captain Garret's romance with her helicopter pilot.  As a reader, I found it an interesting flaw in an otherwise strong character.  It slowed me down for a little while, but the action drew me right back in.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2004-11-09

Beach's actual experiences in WWII, this is the best example of a submarine warfare novel I've ever had the pleasure to read. Captain Beach was a master of the military thriller before the term had even been invented. If you've read Run Silent Run Deep, it's probably time to read it again. If you've never read it, you're in for a treat!<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2004-11-09

I admit that I wasn't particularly interested in reading a contemporary novel by Gibson, but this book proves that he can pull it off.  Seen through the eyes of Cayce Pollard, the present is every bit as compelling as any of Gibson's famously dystopian futures.  He paints the world as it is, and still manages to show the bones of the cyber-gothic Neuromancer future protruding through the tightly stretched fabric of the present.  Good stuff.  Gibson's art has definitely grown.  I can't wait to see what he does next.<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2004-11-09

US	35184850	R3GPGL524MG6L3	0743224124	649153001	Redrobe	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Guilty Pleasures	This one is a lot of fun (and probably shouldn't be).  The anti-hero, AXL, is a tangle of self-contradictions that make him not so much complex as convoluted.  He has built a reputation for being good at things that no one should ever be good at, and he frequently wants to fail even as he struggles desperately to succeed.  The resulting tension kept me turning the pages long after I should have gone to sleep.  I'm not sure the plot ever did make sense to me, but I'm fairly confident that the author never intended that it should.  While this may violate a fundamental rule of story telling (the whole thing must make some sort of sense in the end), it strikes me as a recognizable -- if distorted -- view of real life.  As weird as Grimwood's vision of the future is, it's not any stranger than a world that can produce the likes of Jerry Springer and the infamous 'Bum Fights' videos.  If you are a fan of cyberpunk, this is as darkly distopian as it gets.  Dress warm, make sure your gun is loaded, and I'll see you on the other side. ;)<br /><br />Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\"	2002-10-02
