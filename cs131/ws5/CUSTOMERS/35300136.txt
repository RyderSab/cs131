I agree with Peter Green.  Free men in a democracy have the right to screw up their country, their government, and anything else they like.  That is the meaning of freedom.  Many do not like this and there is currently a longing in our society for more ordered times.  Freedom is just that: freedom.  So this book is meaningless.  What one really hopes is that there are enough safeguards in place to keep any one person (or group of people) from destroying our country. This is what happened to ancient Greece.	2005-08-30
US	35300136	RAGX9HN54SLUF	0691114072	893564720	Flight Dynamics	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Ode to State Variable Methods	This is Stengel's contribution to the flight dynamics literature with some emphasis on controls.  There are things I like about this book and things I do not like about this book.  First, I like his statement and treatment of the equations of motion and the engineering and physics of flight and its control.  The only problem I have with those parts of the book is that the Euler angle and quaternion sections have clearly been written by someone who has never had to actually use them in a simulation etc.  The equations are, however, as far as I can tell correct.  But the student/engineer will have to do some digging to get what they need.  Second, there is an awful lot of good information in this book and it provides pretty much an all in one reference book for flight dynamics.  Most of it is very readable. <br />Now for the parts I don't like.  First, with just a little effort this book could have covered missiles as well as airplanes ( just like Blakelock ).  This is not a big sin and is very popular though.  Second, Stengel's treatment of the flight coefficients in the stability frame are strange and do not seem to follow the standard conventions.  They are correct but the normalized approach developed by NACA and propounded by Blakelock led directly to servomotor design.  There is an additional step in Stengel's approach.  Several of his frames of reference seem to suffer from similar maladies.  There is nothing wrong with this of course but it may be that he was so busy trying to leave his own mark that he did in fact neglect several aviation traditions in this domain.  He does mention the old DATCOM work but one can not directly use DATCOM from his book without first doing some more work.  Third, many of the most advanced concepts are glossed over or just touched upon.  This is being sold as a textbook but it is really more of a treatise ( a not uncommon identity crisis these days ).  Neural networks, modern controller designs, and others are just pranced over.The literature is cited however and of course one can just go look it up.  A little more depth in some areas would have been appreciated, however.  Fourth,  evidently we can't have a book on flight dynamics without singing odes to lqr and lqg.  These methods are popular with the state space crowd since normally there is no clearcut relationship between eigenvalue placement and phase margin.  lqr in some of its incarnations is known to have excellent phase margin properties ranging as high as infinity.  This is perfect impementation of course and lqg is standing by to solve that issue.  These methods have their place in the control engineers arsenal but to use lar/lqg to establish the basic flight path of the aircraft with the pilots inputs just used to make small trim changes about that direction probably violates the current trend towards 100% control authority for at least some types of aircraft and the pilot needs to retain at least enough to be able to handle problems.  When these idealistic problems are solved the lqr/lqg controller methods begin to look more like current controller designs. <br /> <br />Anyhow, this is an excellent book that any flight controls or aviation engineer will find more than just useful.  It provides a pretty complete treatment of the state variable approach and should serve as an excellent starting point for those wanting to design actual controllers for aircraft.	2005-08-22

Unfortunatly fly-by-wire and some other newer methods now practicable because of increased on-board computing power are not really covered but are hinted at in places.   This tome provides probably the easiest to understand approach to aircraft control in existance.  Straightforward and oriented to a step-by-step approach, it beats many of the \\"classic\\" texts popular with many professors hands down.  Being a controls kind of guy,  I particularly enjoy his use of normalized stability derivatives which result in controller designs already in units that can be directly used for servomotor design.  A good understanding of this book will be of enormous use to even the most moderm airplane control system designer.  For many years this book has been the secret weapon of those \\"in the know\\". <br />This book is oriented almost exclusively to frequency domain methods but there is a state variable approach chapter.  Currently, there is a return to state-space methods movement in progress but this material in Blakelock is mandatory even for understanding the state-space methods.  Examine Stengel's new work Flight Dynamics. <br />	2005-08-22

A detailed reading of and knowledge of Herodotus is presumed.  That said, this book sheds much light on some of the questions unanswered by Herodotus and many of the statements by Herodotus that have remained controversial over the centuries.  It should also be pointed out that Peter Green apparently is from England originally and uses, on occasion, English slang.  I would not say it grates or is irritating, however. <br />     Many have accused Peter Green of being a revisionist historian as if that is some kind of crime.  What is most irritating to some of these critics is his defense of democracy evident throughout his writings.  Just as a couple of hundred of years ago Americans read the ancient Greeks and Romans for ideas supporting democracy, many present day readers long for more ordered times and read the Greeks and Romans for support.  Peter Green has the audacity to point out that free men have the right to do as they please with their freedom including mucking up their lives and country.  This is anathema to many and may explain why he decided to live in the United States. <br />     Anyhow, this is a wonderful supplement to Herodotus.  It is not boring and you simply cannot go wrong.	2005-04-02

This is the old \\"keep the IRS from getting your money\\" scam.  He downplays 401ks and Roth IRAs and even dividend free stock purchases to promote insurance.  To do this he downplays the risk of many of these high-paying insurance companies by redefining the standard way of evaluating them.  This increases risk which he never mentions.  The idea is that because of tax policies of the government the spendable income from insurance will be greater than that of 401ks.  But by the time he is finished that is actually not the case.  He has the investor periodically taking all the equity out of his home, and putting far more money into the insurance than he ever would in a 401k so I would hope the takehome would be more.  I have a better plan.  Buy a high quality set of non-dividend paying stocks and hold them until old age.  Problem solved.  Frankly, this book has so many holes in its logic that I am incoherent.  This is the worst of the financial planning craze.  Success in this field depends on the ability to identify potential products and to package them.  Here the solution is whole life insurance.	2005-03-08

He also appears to understand the difference between the ancients and ourselves and is much more objective than the average.  Those with an axe to grind will not like or appreciate that.  Recently , on the History Channel, several British scholars were interviewed about the Roman emperor Augustus.  They were so excited that Augustus had apparently replaced the republic with a monarchy that they were about to pee on themselves.  Peter Green  does not appear to have any such  agendas in mind except to correct the blind admiration so prevalent in the poor scholarship that continues to surround Alexander to this day.  As far as I can tell a little revisionism did the story of Alexander the Great a world of good.  We appear to be entering an age of blind admiration of Alexamder the Great again.  This does not bode well.  I was recently in a major bookstore and an entire display was dedicated to works on Alexander demonstrating little or no scholarship.  There is even a leadership book using him as a role model.  I guess the consultants are running out of names and stories.  Anyhow, for anybody looking for a tremendous entry point into the Alexander literature, this is by far and away the best book  out there.	2005-01-29

The book is poorly disguised advertising.  With that said I believe Rogers is sincere in his beliefs.  However, as usual there are several caveats.  First, he quotes papers and research showing that investing in commodies in the past has been less risky and had better returns than equities or bonds.  All of this research however ignores institutional risk associated with commodity investing.  The fees are high, the market is sometimes manipulated, the investor virtually has to use a full service brokerage firm, and even Roger's mutual fund is available only through a broker and has high surrender charges.  Second, although many money handlers like Rogers end up rich, it is almost never pointed out that the vast majority of their money is not made by their own fantastic investing but by charging high fees to their investors.  Look at the fees on the Rogers fund.  Good God.  Third, the various commodity indexes that are out there are new.  Gibson, in his book on asset allocation, took the Goldman Sachs index back to the good old days of the seventies not bothering to point out that the GMCI only dates back to 1992 and so this was essentially backtesting - a popular hobby even though there is much evidence to indicate this is not the way to go.  There are good reasons to believe that the commodity bull market of today will not repeat the golden years of the seventies even though it is real enough.  None of this even touches the fact that the average investor should only have 5 - 10% of his money (at the most) in commodities.  Either high minimums on the funds or huge front and back end fees will keep everyman out.  Nevertheless, Rogers is correct in his assertion that learning about commodities will help any investor look at the world in a different way, and, in the long run, teaching the investor the basics of understanding commodities is the real contribution of this book.  Those looking for a commodity investing how to book will have to keep looking.  He is pushing commodities indexing.	2005-01-29

This is another you can run a marathon in n weeks book that has the athelete adding a huge number of training miles in a very short period of time.  The authors also provide a program to get nonrunners started.  They claim there has never been a failure.  First, the results are based on a course and no information is provided on dropout rate.  Second, the authors have written journal papers on the results from the course and conveniently not included the dropouts.  Thirdly, although the authors claim the runners are from a variety of backgrounds, weights, etc. this is not really true.  There is only one truly heavy runner and he was a former football player.  Fourth, for some inexplicable reason, the authors seem to believe the runner can run through just about any kind of injury!  The mental training aspects of the book are good enough and the stretching sections are useful for the uninitiated.  But many people will be injured if they follow this training plan.  The real basic assumption here is that those for who the program does not work will disappear and not be heard from again.  That is unfortunate for there is a real need for a book at this level.	2004-11-02

However, there are several severe flaws.  First, the authors are confused about their audience.  It is never clear when they are talking to novices and when they are addressing elites. They float around willy-nilly first addressing one then the other.  Warnings are given to beginners right in the middle of long spiels obviously addressed only to pros.  I believe this book is probably meant for novice to intermmediate triatheletes. But the authors are inconsistent in their approach to this.  Second, most of the equipment information is very shallow but nevertheless useful to novices.  However, once again the intended audience is unclear.  Thirdly, the training bricks, many workout, and much of the advice are clearly geared to triatheletes who are very advanced.  Any first-timer is going to overtrain  and many advanced atheletes will as well if they utilize some of these workouts.  They authors recommend no more than two breakthough workouts per week!!  Is anybody else reading this?  So once again the audience is unclear.  If the authors are going to address novices then they need to do so in a consistent way throughout the book.  The same with elites and intermmediates etc.  Despite these flaws I managed to extract a great deal of useful information from this book and will continue to use it.	2004-10-26

As some others have noted there is a lot of discussion on why things should be done this way and the author spends a great deal of the book \\"on the soapbox.\\" But this is because of the need for convincing others.

Alberto Salazar is obviously trying to convey the best information he can to the reader and he does a great job.  The book is weak in the area of training schedules but strong on virtually everything else.  Most of the book has been useful to me on a daily basis.  The only real complaint I have is that the author, like many of the older elite runners , does not personally do as much stretching as he recommends for the reader, does not use a heart rate monitor, etc.  But he, as a coach, recommends it to other runners while not having a whole lot of personal experience and it shows.  I use both so sometimes I read between the lines.  He also does not understand cycling and its effect on the runner.  A not uncommon malady among runners.	2004-10-26

The best part of the book for me was the discussion of heart rate training, something that is barely mentioned in many of the other running books.

I don't like any of them. Either they are too vague and basically are advertisements for professional repairs or they are outdated even in the latest editions.  Or, worse yet, expensive advertisements for tools and gimicks. The Bicycle Repair Manual is really all anybody needs.  If you need much more than this then you are repairing junk which should be replaced.  This manual allowed me, in the space of just a few hours, to go from knowing nothing about derailleurs to completely removing, reinstalling, and perfectly adjusting the gear system on an old bike I bought at a garage sale for a few bucks.  It now operates better than some I could spend a couple of hundred times as much on.  And all because of this book.  I cannot think of a better recommendation to give a book of this kind.

But much of it is concerned with \\"misconceptions\\" that border on attempts at fraud and showing that you just can't get away with it.  The main theme of the book although the author does not point this out is KISS.  Keep It Simple Stupid.  That way you can understand it.  Also the sections on minimum distributions are useful.  I will leave it up to the individual, as it should be, to determine the usefulness of insuring the estate tax portion of a retirement plan.  All in all a rather useful tome but I am not sure it required all that so to speak.  As others have pointed out the \\"humor\\" in the book is distracting and does not add much.

There is a lot of good ideas in this book.  But the author, instead of sharing what works for him and letting the reader decide what is appropriate for him/her self tries the one size fits all approach in some areas.  The book completely ignores the use of computers for tracking money and the investment advice in the book is very low level and shallow.  All in all most of the book is just personal opinion.  For those who are truly ignorant of these matters it may have some use but in general it is a paen to the author's personal methods backed up by a few horror stories.  As is frequently the case in this situation much of this is wrongly interpreted and may not even be correct.  In general the book relies too much on ancecdotal evidence for those areas of our lives for which objective evidence is available.  Still there are some useful ideas in the book and the book is worthwhile reading.  But there is just too much childish ego at work here to make the book a first rank reference.

Let me first say that I like this book better than most of the other investing psychology books out there that I have examined.  But I have two problems with the book.  First, there is an investor psychology test at the back of the book which is also available on a website.  My question is, especially after reading the test questions, how scientific is this test?  I doubt that it really tells the taker anything but many will be suduced by it anyhow.  Most of this material I have seen is either rubbish or Mickey Mouse.  Second, any investor that needs this material does not need this material.  In other words any investor that does not already understand this material independent of the book a priori is certainly not in need of studying this book and then attempting to beat the market with his/her new found knowledge.  My own experience is that the psychological equipment needed to truly outwit the market is necessarily the result of long hard experience, not reading books.  The completely clueless may find solace here but until the material is internalized  it is probably of not much use.  The book provides no help on internalization.	2003-10-06

This is actually a wonderful introduction to the theory of derivatives and personally I find it to be a little humorous on occasion as well.  There is definitely some ego here but it does not interfere with the author's sincere attempt to present the material in such a way that it can be understood easily by anyone with the required math background.  That of course is the problem for some: this book requires a fairly extensive math background to be really understood.  Fakers may try, but the successful will have a pretty good background in mathematics.  That said, the discussion of stochastic calculus is better than many have led the casual onlooker to believe.  It is not rigorous but is perfectly sufficient for the subject matter at hand.  A good understanding of the material in this book will make the reader truly dangerous in the realms of the PDE theory of derivatives.	2003-10-02

But I also notice that Victor Hanson provided the bibliography rather than the author and no sources are quoted for the essays at the back and the bibliography is mostly secondary sources.

I have used the electricity volume as supplemental information for an E&amp;M course I taught with success.  But I could not have turned the students aloose by themselves.  These books are full of errors in math and even some in physics.  Feynman never meant these books to become the holy grail of physics they have sort of become.  These books are the babies of an experimental freshman physics course at Cal Tech designed to reduce the outflow to the EE department.  Feynman considered the course a failure partly because of his lack of time and involvement.  Nevertheless, I have read some of the material with a great deal of enjoyment.

I was befuddled the first semester but made a good grade.  Between the first and second semesters I had to study for and take the qualifiers.  I used Jeans and Smythe's Static and Dynamic Electricity and found these to be excellent though difficult texts.  As a corollary I also re-studied the required mathematics.   Now I understood where Jackson was coming from!  I was able to not only solve all the problems in the electostatics and Maxwell equations sections of Jackson but also my studies from Smythe and Jeans covered much of the second semester of Jackson also.  When I took the second semester I was able to breeze through solving the problems and taking the tests to such an extent that my professors, who had trouble with the problems, wondered what had happened.  It did not hurt that a close friend and I had recently built a radio telescope array in the hills of Tennessee during vacation thereby obtaining a nearly irreproducible knowledge of antenna theory.  In my opinion, Jackson is mostly a guideline for studying electrodynamics.  Once the student has the background Jackson is both fun and enlightening.  Therein lies the difficulty.  I have noticed that many libraries have \\"put up\\" or gotten rid of their Jeans and Smythes and other classical texts.  The new books are not really a substitute.  Since many professors did not really learn electrodynamics that well themselves, this make it truly difficult to obtain a really great grounding in the subject.  I did not truly understand the difference until I was doing a lot of computational electrodynamics years later.  Regardless of how one goes about it, somehow the student must get the required background before really using Jackson in any meaningful fashion.  Current education in physics has made this more not less difficult.	2003-09-11

There is a lot here but the author is another one of those who believes the student is best served by working it out for himself.  That may be true but it is also the easy way out for textbook writers and teachers.  Also, the course should at least be set up so that the student can find out the correct answer.  My experience is that the mathematical physics courses that use this book are not.  At the time this book first came out there was no other suitable book.  That, unfortunately, is how so many of the physics texts become classics, not by being useful or good.  Also, the treatment is mostly of very classical mathematical physics.  I pity the student who attempts to get a good background in group theory from this book for use in GR or particle theory.  Better books exist nowadays partly as a reaction to this book.

It is short and to the point without leaving out too much.  Just the essentials.  However, I do believe there are better books out there today and there are gaps in the treatment in this book.  For instance it is not as strong on the Dirac representation as it should be.  I have come to the realization that it is best if the various representations are presented in depth in the first quantum mechanics course rather that being scattered thoughout graduate study or not even covered.  Nevertheless, when I wanted a good solid treatment of a subject that was vague or glossed over in the other books this is where I came.  Next was the literature.	2003-09-11

Some of the details are missing and the perturbation theory and scattering sections do need additional details but overall I found his method of introducing the Dirac notation about the best for me personally.  Others may differ.  Make no mistake about it: this is not a book that you can just hand to a student and tell them to go on about it and be a responsible instructor.  It does suffer from the same limitation as almost all other QM books: it just teaches QM but does not tell the student what theoretical physics is all about.  They probably do this because the course is for such a wide range of people.  But I still believe the communication of this information lends insight unavailable elsewhere and useful for all.  That is what make Dirac's book on QM great even today (although I will not presume to maintain its relevance for the modern student).	2003-09-11

In some ways the book is not what it should be as in the analysis of spacecraft attitude control. The emphasis here is the simplification of the nonlinear Euler equations to simple linear equations to which bang-bang and other control types are then applied.  Nothing wrong with that.  But if he had left the equations nolinear and applied sliding mode control the results would have been virtually identical and more profound and usable.  At the same time there is much information on spacecraft attitude control in the book which is nearly impossible to find elsewhere.  The same is true of helicopter and airplane control.  The complete emphasis on LQR control is quaint as it is the best possible control.  What about more realistic control systems for real aircraft?  There is a little in the book on this but very little.  The sections on control of flexible systems correspond to the way many missle modelers approach the problem because of its simplicity and usefulness and several useful and interesting examples are worked out.  Overall this is a useful reference for certain subject areas but it takes a sophisticated reader to separate the wheat from the chaff.  It must be admitted, however, that learning the entire book would not be a bad thing for anyone.  Just limiting.	2003-09-09

A Book of Practical Counsel (Revised Edition) (Collins Business Essentials)	Books	3	150	199	N	N	Tired	Although I am mostly a value investor, this has never been my favorite book.  The old 1973 edition which this replaces was dated and the examples were hard to relate  to today's market.   Even the previous editions were not ones I particularly enjoyed.  Quite frankly, the book was and is boring.  Also many of the investment ideas in the book simply do not work in today's market.  For example, I agree with Niederhoffer that buying companies for less that Net Current Assets is ridiculous in general.  Most who claim to be successful at this are simply liars.  This technique worked for a short time following and during the great depression.  But that was basically it.  The idea of approaching one's investments as a business is old hat now but for those not familiar with the concept this book may be worthwhile although whether it is worth buying the book for this tidbit is debatable.  The Buffettology books do this just as well and are more up to date.  Despite the laughter and venom directed against these books they are useful modern investment books which the budding value investor would do well to read.  This update does use more modern examples but with the rise of the internet this type of information is just not as rarely available as it once was. I just wonder how many more &quot;revisions&quot; this book can stand before it becomes like Graham's Security Analysis.  Keep in mind this is a new edition of a book by a man who has been dead for years ( and not the first one at that).  The modern investor would probably be better off learning something about valuation and applying that to determine if companies are undervalued.  The primitive methods in Graham are not particularly useful today and do not reflect the methods of today's successful value investor.	2003-09-07

Coming out of this bear market, many will be initially successful but over the long haul most will lag the S&amp;P 500.

Barbara Ehrenreich  is quite honest in the book both about who she is and where she comes from and also about the limitations of her project.  Despite several rather prejudiced comments ( this book is very honest) which have left many readers cold the book is an accurate portrayal of life at and near minimum wage ( or less).  One may be able to get by on less but only by effectively becoming a bum.  Ms Ehrenreich makes no attempt to hide her own feelings about either the situations or the people and she makes no attempt of any kind to justify or apologize for her background or feelings.  Those who are bothered by total honesty from another person will probably not like this book.  Also, in the last chapter and in several other places Ms. Ehrenreich's lack of knowledge of economics is apparent.  The opinions she expresses on how best to remedy the situation are almost certainly useless.  But that is the point of the book: if she is wrong what is the correct solution?  The book is really an attempt to get a dialog going.  Unfortunately, this attempt  will fail just as surely as others in the past.  At least she got a lot of people thinking about the subject.  One more thing - whenever raising the minimum wage comes up employers are fond of pointing out that most people working minimum wage jobs are young people using them as starting positions and jumping stones to better paying jobs.  This book gives the lie to that notion.	2003-09-06

It is obvious to the sophisticated investor that the author works for an investment house that has something to sell.  No attempt is made to directly sell anything but it definitely is an attempt to show the average investor why he needs someone else to do his asset allocation.  Hardly a guide to indexing, the author advocates tactical allocation as well as strategic allocation.  The problem with this is that tactical allocation is little more than trend following in the guise of asset allocation.  Since the market has been down and many have had their rear ends shot off by the market asset allocation is the byword of the day.  More sophisticated asset allocation advocates have long realized that their art hardly appealed to the masses.  The addition of the ability to knob twiddle the allocation is an attempt not only to add a little spice to the mixture but to also advocate the need for an advisor.  From what I can see the bait is being taken.  William Bernstein advocated a little tactical reallocation on occasion in the guise of rebalancing.  Rebalancing is great and necessary but trying to optimize the portfolio to catch the next wave is a fool's errand.  Darst is somewhere in the middle of this argument.  That said, the book contains some useful information.  There is a description of the various asset classes and their advantages and disadvantages which is excellent.  Those who are looking for an real estate investment handbook will be disappointed however.  The calculation of alpha is described and mean variance optimizers are discussed (there is even a little about their limitations).  The entire book reads a little like a sales brochure.  Complicated graphical and pictoral representations are used to present simple ideas.  Some of the statistics is biased towards what you would expect from a financial advisor.  Most of this is subtle and may not be deliberate on the part of the author.  But it is fascinating to compare this information with that of Bernstein and realize that even if it is unconcious an attempt is being made to create a dependency.  Once a salesman always a salesman?  Anyhow, this book combined with the Intelligent Asset Allocator and Gibson's Asset Allocation will be all any investor needs to properly allocate their wealth without an advisor if so desired.  But anyone who read widely about asset allocation will also realize that no book will tell them how to allocate their assets: it is an art.  Mean variance optimizers are mostly useful for educational purposes.  Also not all of the asset classes discussed are appropriate for anyone let alone the rich.  Just remember the concept of the whale.	2003-09-01

Herodotus may have pulled our legs sometimes but he did show that they were in reality very different from ourselves.  I see this problem everywhere in Greek scholarship.

I have read the original Greek extensively and I see no evidence of superior insight on Kagan's part.  This is an interesting but annoying read for those who do not wish to have an additional filter of opinion placed between themselves and the Greeks.  Kagan, for all his scholarship, falls into the old trap of believing that the Greeks are really just old versions of ourselves.  After all they are a large part of the basis for Western civilization, right?  Herodotus may pull our other leg at times but reading him does show that although like us in some ways they were very different.  Thucydides has his problems but Kagan reading him and then regurgitatiing will not solve the problem.  Adding in Aristotle's two cents and some Xenophon will not assist much either.  The newer work in epigraphy may very well have a bearing but I don't know how much Kagan relies on this information.   Simple example?  The Athenians vote to send and do send a peace mission to the Spartans over Pericles objections.  This therefore shows that Thucydides' claim that at the time of the war the Athenian's claim to democracy was in name only is false. Not necessarily true.  Some real discussion is in order here.  But Kagan is rather shallow at this point.	2003-08-02

The stories he tells about how managers are selected rings especially true to me.  I work in the defense industry and seldom see anybody capable promoted.

But it is scarce on the conclusions side.  I know this is deliberate and that the purpose of the authors was just to provide a volume of data with some interpretation but there are just too many loose ends.<br />First, although much is made of the quality of the data much of the data is from other authors and sources and is used blindly.  In other words much of what the authors have done is collation.  <br />Second, there are several countries that ostensibly did better than the U.S and Britain during the twentieth century but little is said about this fact and indeed the authors spend some pages justifying the emphasis on the U.S. and Great Britain  during the twentieth century.  But the reasons they give are hollow.  There may have been justification but greater depth was in order.  <br />Third, although there is a great deal of information in the book several graphs are presented in a confusing manner i.e. the same color line is used for several curves on the same graph making interpretation almost impossible.<br />Fourth, reading the book is in many places a lot like taking the SAT or GRE graph interpretation section.  There is much here but it would have been much more impressive if the authors had drawn some deeper conclusions than was the case.  Probably many will attempt to justify this deficiency by stating that the purpose of the book was the assembly of the data in one place and that others will use the data for developing profound interpretations and conclusions.  But I don't believe that will happen: the authors understand that the main users of the book will be institutional and personal investors.  That is sad for there is much to be interpreted here in a deep and satisfying manner.<br />Fifth, the authors clearly suscribe to the idea that the data in this book will help readers determine the most likely future returns of the stock markets.  But I suspect strongly that William Bernstein is correct and that past returns are best at determining future risks of investing and rather less usefull for determining future returns.  The case the authors make for using the data for determining future results is laughable: in essence everybody else does it.  The hypothesis may be true but that is hardly a case for it. <br />Sixth, it would have been fascinating for the authors to have analysed how open some of these societies were during various periods in the twentieth century and related that to investment performance.<br />Those that believe a CD or soft copy would have been better because of the more detailed access to the data have missed the point entirely.<br />In the final analysis there is enough data here to keep political economists, sophisticated investors, and many others occupied for many years-if nothing else they can attempt to fill in some of the gaping holes.  For instance, many in the U.S. believe that our inflation numbers for several years now are &quot;cooked&quot; to some extent.  Certainly this is true for some other countries as well.  Yet every bit of the inflation data is presented as the gospel with no challenge or analysis.  If the authors did do some analysis here (or even if the primary sources did) and found the &quot;cooking&quot; insignificant or significant then it seems they should have presented their findings in a more complete fashion.  Is the data reliable or not?  That is the question.  This is just one example out of the entire book. Hardly a page goes by without similar questions arising.  Too bad the authors could not be bothered to answer any of them  <br />Finally, it is particulary fun to read Triumph of the Optimists in conjunction with Adventure Capitalist.	2003-07-09

Afterwards Heinlein changed his style and many would agree not for the better.  One problem with this book is that it does not flow as well as his earlier works partly because Heinlein takes up too many pages with thinly disguised preaching about society and how it should be run.  Bear in mind that Heinlein was essentially of the Campbell school of thought about science fiction:  take an idea and derive its logical conclusions and consequences and present them in story form.  But no matter how one tries, when the subject is about economics, society, and people rather than about physics, chemistry, and engineering, personal opinion and bias is bound to creep in.  The bias in this book shows very clearly that Heinlein, although progressive in some areas of thought, was definitely a prisoner of his time in others.	2003-07-05

There is much to like about this book both as a travel monologue and as one man's assessment of the world's financial markets. I do have problems with it but they are on a personal level.  First, I am greatly disappointed with the final chapter of the book:the analysis is shallow and as seems to be the wont of investment and financial books these days the emphasis is on ad hominum attacks and rather childish analogies.  Many will no doubt find it entertaining but I am looking for something more.  After all, Rogers is a graduate of Yale and Oxford.  But he thinks about and analyses many subjects like a graduate of the local junior college.  This is especially apparent to me when he analyses subjects which intersect with my life that I am knowledgeable about and it makes me wonder about the accuracy of his other observations.  Nevertheless there is enough of interest in the book to justify five stars.<br />One reviewer stated that this is a book without heart and without usable business advice.  The later is simply not true although when Rogers writes about subjects of depth his lack thereof shows.  As far as it being a book without heart the author speaks passionately about those subjects which truly interest him and they are the ones related to money, investing and economics.  In one place he speaks of his unborn child as the child but this will change I assure you when the child is born.  I had a college professor similar to Jim Rogers who got married rather late and proceeded to have children and they rapidly proceeded from disembodied concepts to tangibles.  Children have a knack that way.  I know.  What is perhaps most tragic about this book is that the author has not yet matured to the point that he can really speak about some of the places and people he visited.  But he will get there if he stays married this time and it will be interesting to see what the next book islike.<br />Another fact of note is that some of the controversial aspects of Investment Biker have been avoided this time around.  This is probably due to the fact that much of the trip was communicated via a website in &quot;real-time&quot; giving Jim Rogers a chance to probe the waters.  An interesting idea.	2003-07-01

The testimonials are a nice touch and some make sense for me. I am primarily a stock market investor. That is what I know and understand best-it is my specialty. I have alway had an interest in real estate but I really did not understand how to go about it. This book provides some very usable techniques for the newcomer. Also techniques for avoiding losing money are presented throughout the book. I only have two complaints but they are not really about just this book. First, there is no section that deals with the risks of real estate investing in an explicit way. This is a peeve of mine with both stock investing and real estate investing. The tone shall we say is upbeat and devil take the hindmost. There is no crime in explicitly discussing risk and I do not understand why people do not do this when they write books about real estate and stocks. Nevertheless this book contains much more information on how not to lose money than virtually any other book on real estate I have seen. Second, I wonder about the level of research and exposure in the real estate arena. In stocks the vast majority of profit is made at the market level with the complete curve being gaussian. I wonder if the same is true in real estate or if there are real opportunities to \\"beat the market\\" in real estate. But these are advanced questions that reading this book got me thinking about and that is good. This is the first real estate book I have read which could convince me to participate.	2003-06-18

There is a lot to like about this book and the historical section in particular is interesting and unique in investment literature.  Bernstein traces much of the performance of the last twenty years back to a sort of backlash to the deflation of the depression years and notes the troubles in coming off the gold standard in the early twentieth century.  True to current investment themes he offers yet another estimate for long term future returns (lower of course).  One of a cast of thousands.  I am not convinced by the case he has made for indexing only.  Not that I think indexing is a bad way to go (it may be the only way to go) but this book does not prove the superiority of indexing.  It does provide a strong case for it however.  Indexing is a great way to proceed for the monies we must have in the future.  It is interesting to note that the literature from Tweedy Browne takes exactly the opposite side of the equation.  Lately I have noticed this tendency in several investing books/resources.  For instance Bernstein notes that there is no reason to expect a money manager that beats the market over a five year period to continue to do so.  Tweedy Browne notes that there is no reason a priori to expect a money manager not to continue to do so.  What is interesting is that this amounts to saying that the ability to beat the market is essentially random.  This of course agrees with the vast majority of evidence.  For the average investor (and most people are average investors) the indexing method is best by far.  This probably includes most people that consider themselves day traders.  Bernstein does point out that most professional money managers use indexing for their personal portfolios regardless of what they recommend to their clients.  However, I am not sure if this phenomenon has been objectively studied.  The bottom line is that indexing does reduce the probability that the individual investor will be eating Alpo in his/her old age.  But indexing also reduces the probability that the elderly investor will be eating caviar as well.  Bernstein knows this and goes out of his way to point it out.  That being said the best approach may be to index most of the money and have some set aside for stock picking or active management thereby partaking of the best of both worlds.  Berstein also uses the same black magic for establishing the model portfolios that he used in The Intelligent Asset Allocator.  Once again, asset allocation is shown to be as much an art as a science.  Whatever turns out to be true the reader will find this to be an interesting, generally well reasoned book.	2003-06-17

The basic idea of analyzing the consequences of economic policymaking on every group in society instead of just certain special interest groups is sound.  But there is much more to this book than that.  The Keynesians are decried and the book is essentially a tribute to laissez faire capitalism.  This is fine except like Von Mises and the rest of the crowd there are implicit assumptions which are never addressed on every page.  That is the basic problem with the deductive approach to economics: it is not deductive.  Nobody ever points out that Hazlitt assumes virtually every curve in economics is linear or at best only very slightly nonlinear.  That simple assumption despite what Hazlitt says is critical.  The shape of these curves probably change over time and are deeply related to whether the \\"free market\\" or Keynesians are mostly correct.  I suspect very strongly that which is best changes over time and that extremes either way are detrimental to the population and government.  It has always been fascinating to me that although a large free market school has developed over time none of them appear to do any real mathematical or economic analysis ( If they did they would understand what a bunch of hooeey much of the content of this book and others is.) and that one notable free market proponent i.e. Greenspan may be getting ready to do a very Keynesian thing to the economy.  In the long run objectivism and laissez faire capitalism have become interwined and confused over time and suffer from the same problems.  I am not a government controls proponent.  I have the same problem with the government intervention policies: it is essentially knob-twiddling and I have a congenital disorder which causes my rear end to seize up whenever the knob-twiddlers start up.  It would be different if they actually knew what they were doing but even the stupid realize that they really don't and even Greenspan freely admits as much.  Nor am I Keynesian in outlook.  I noticed recently they are trying to justify themselves in textbooks by pointing out that inflation may not really cause much damage to the public and that what actually causes the damage are some of the things that occurred concurrently with inflation in the past.  There oughta be a law against this kind of tripe.  Inflating the economy just for the fun of it has caused all kinds of damage this century.  There may be times when inflating the economy a little may be the way to proceed.  But the hyperinflation of the 1965 - 1985 timeframe did many people in the population a great deal of harm and yes much of it was due to phenomenon which accompanied inflation instead of the inflation itself.  But that may be the character of inflation.  Many of the neo-Keynesians were in diapers during this time and the record is not as objective as a scientist would like.  The truth lies somewhere out there at any given time and I suspect that economists that are not too tightly glued to any one school of thought are the most likely to find it.  Let's hope someone is looking.	2003-06-07

There are several difficulties however.  First, it indirectly promulgates the idea that to become a millionaire one must take all sorts of great risks.  In reality before a risk is undertaken it should be understood at some level.  Most people that become millionaires understand the necessity for this.  Taking unfettered risk is the fastest way to lose everything.  Second, it is essentially Think and Grow Rich tranlated into fable format thereby suffering from the same flaws.  Third, it is apparently unable to avoid the reincarnation belief trap.  This book is not similar to The Richest Man in Babyon.  George Clason's book contains extremely good advice for anyone without the mumbo jumbo and without recommending excessive risk.  The Instant Millionaire sounds good but is really not in the same class.  There is a certain inspirational element to it however and it is a clever enjoyable read.	2003-05-29

There are many things to like about this book.  The emphasis is on providing investment advisors with the information on asset allocation they need to connect successfully with clients.  The only real flaw I see in the book is the watering down of material so that clients can understand it.  I understand the necessity of doing this but it does leave open the door for dishonesty of the car salesman variety.  Every investor even comtemplating using an investment advisor or even a broker should read this book from cover to cover.  If he/she hears anything from the selected advisor that deviates much at all from what is here he/she should run not walk out the door.  Perhaps the most important contribution of the book is the emphasis on the interaction of portfolio components to produce higher returns than undiversified or underdiversified portfolios.  Gibson uses the Commodities Index  as one of the portfolio components along with the EAFE, S&amp;P 500, and REITs to show this.  This index component is available in practical form as the Oppenheimer Real Assets fund.  If you have net investment assets that allow private money management this is not a problem as the money management firm can buy more than 1 million dollars worth  and distribute it among the clients.  If you do not qualify for a typical money management firm the mutual fund charges a 5.75% load thereby making rebalancing something of a problem.  Perhaps infrequent rebalancing would work.  Therein lies the problem with the book.  Even though Gibson is as honest as the day is long, the information presented is designed to handle the clients expectations and fears.  All kinds of techniques and information are presented most of it assuming very little brains from the people who made all that money ( all of whom we would normally be assured are brilliant not just at making money but in all aspects of their lives ).  A,B,C,D are all presented but when portfolio design time comes E is recommended and not just dueto tailoring to the individuals needs or risk tolerance.  Gibson tells the reader that it is necessary to manage the clients expectations and to make the portfolio more like that of the clients friends or more in keeping with clients prior expectations and thereby more acceptable.  This may be true.  But Berstein does the same thing in The Intelligent Asset Allocator.  His reasoning is a little different:many of the models primarily rely on data mining or make certain assumptions and he believes in the use of index funds almost exclusively. So Bersteins portfolios also rely a great deal on judgement.  Both believe that tracking error from the S&amp;P 500 may be an issue.  When all is said and done this is very much an art form.  It is also very much a sales technique albeit an important one.  Nevertheless, both this book and The Intelligent Asset Allocator are required reading for any serious investor.  Gibson's book also has the best discussion of client risk assessment I have seen.	2003-05-17

Here I would like to address the book for novices.  For novices this is a much better book than I perhaps led others to believe.  The discussion of technical analysis is excellent and the discussion on REITS is outstanding. The only real problem is that this information is rather generally available but perhaps not in as entertaining a format.  Overall the book is definitely worth reading for the novice investor as it debunks (again) many of the market myths.  I have never subscribed to many of them myself but am well aware that many others do.  The only real problem that I have with the book from the beginning investors point of view is the level of emotional maturity displayed by the authors ( they may have thought of it as humor unfortunately ), the ad hominum attacks on Benjamin Graham, and the rather sad analysis of value investing that fails to take into consideration that a wide range of value investing methods exist just as a wide range of growth investing methods exist.  A false negative case for growth investing could be made using the exact same methods that Niederhoffer and Kenner used for value investing.  The smart investor will realize that many different growth stock picking schemes exist.  Many of them do not work just as many of the value stock picking schemes do not work.  This little diversion of theirs into junking value investing will mislead many novices and in my view undoes much of the good of the book.  One additonal limitation the novice reader should be made aware of is that the sections on physics analogies are drivel.  But as I said before the book does have some really good discussions and the use of the scientific method is commendable.	2003-04-19

Granted there is good information in the book but a great deal of time is spent attempting to debunk supposedly common beliefs and myths that I have never believed for an instant.  I have difficulty believing the average Joe out there really takes these myths seriously... For instance technical analysis hardly needs more debunking; it is over.  Those who want to believe will, the rest know better by now.  The section on value stocks is less than childish and shallow.  They beat up on Benjamin Graham and value investing  but ignore pages 304-310 of the fifth edition of The Intelligent Investor.  The chapter is mostly an ad hominum attack on Benjamin Graham just so that someone somewhere sometime will have said something bad about Graham.  Fair enough but not really the stuff eternal investment books are made of.  There is also a snide comment in the book about Buffettology that demonstrates conclusively that neither author has read the book.  Other chapters contain similar material: one on using computers to write stock stories, one on eternal bears, etc.. These are ok as cautionary tales but there is really nothing new here.  It should come as no surprise that being an eternal pessimist about the market is rough on one's wallet.  Therein lies the real problem with the book.  The information presented is for novices and dilettantes not for serious investors of any stripe.  Yet the book indirectly promotes short term trading - hardly a suitable investment strategy for newcomers or the average investor.  Even here it is inconsistent.  One chapter contains a mantra on the joys of long term holdings, another harps on the use of scatter plots for determining market relationships month to month and year to year and on and on... Here's the point: the book is an entertaining read that bursts the bubbles of some of the standardstock in trade sales and broker talk out there.  It also promotes the use of the scientific method to the extent possible in studying the markets. Definitely good deeds. But not enough to save the book from mediocrity.<BR>The book trumpets Triumph of the Optimists as the greatest investment book on the market.  It may be.  This one certainly isn't.	2003-04-04

Even after all these years I know what is going to happen next from page to page to such an extent that I am unable to finish the book for the first time ever. Prime Heinlein though.	2003-03-19

It is a story of corporate wrongdoing and a tale of independence. But most of all it is the tale of a boy and his \\"pet\\". A Heinlein classic of the first rank. Once again Heinlein interweaves the impossible with the everyday in a way that makes the reader long for a world that will never exist. It is that combination along with the use of average men that rise above themselves as heroes that makes Heinlein appeal to such a wide audience. Also note that this book was written in 1949 yet discusses terraforming.	2003-03-15

The political part is only relevant as a guide to how things are actually done in that arena and also as a warning about how such things affect one's personal finances  ( and perhaps as a plug for auto insurance reform). Tobias uses his personal experiences to support his position that slow wins the personal fortune game, even for those with a small fortune to start with. His involvement with auto insurance reform cost him money. His real estate investments are still up in the air. His Russian company and advertisments on smoking hazards worked to a degree. What is really great about this book is that Tobias takes you along on a ride through his personal finances:where his money came from, where it went to. Those looking for a finance guide in this book alone will be disappointed. It is more like the \\"laboratory research\\" that supports his point of view in The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need. The only quibble I have with the book is that Chapter 6 Your Vast Fortune appears rushed and scattered. As another reviewer pointed out most of this book is magazine articles collected together. It may be that the parts written to hold it all together are second rate. However, the book is humorous and a good read. It is definitely worth the time. It is also very self-effacing although I am not sure of the sincerity of the author in this regard.	2003-03-11

The comments there largely apply here also. This second book is supposedly written with a down market in mind whereas the first was more bull market oriented. Actually, the second book is a very slightly more sophisticated version of the first where the authors have expanded and clarified several topics. For choosing strong consumer oriented companies with durable competitive advantages the authors include the return on total capital in the selection process. This is simply an additonal filter to what was in the first volume. There is also a more sophisticated study of when to sell a stock and a discussion of what makes a company profitable. This info and a reworded rehash of several chapters of the original are what make up the first 168 pages. There is some new information here that was not in the original. The writing in this first section is better than in the original Buffettology. Most of the remaining holes the reader can fill in with some additional research. Pages 169-189 are a discussion of \\"Where Warren Is Investing Now.\\" There is definitely overlap with the first book here and a lot of it. There are a few additions however and some are worth noting. The section on arbitrage remains lightweight in this version although that may be good for the average investor. The final sections which deal with the mathematical equations are virtually reproduced from the original Buffettology and the workbook. This is sad for that is the portion of the book which could have used rewriting the most. My comments from Buffettology are still true. The math is not as terrible as some believe but the sections could have been written better. Frankly this is just laziness on the authors' part and nothing else. In the final analysis what is probably most useful to note about both books is that they could have used a good financial appendix and a good financial glossary. The value of these already excellent books would have doubled.<BR>	2003-03-06

The book makes a great deal of sense actually and I have made a great deal of money in the stock market using methods almost identical to those espoused in the book.<br />  However, the authors fail to explain why low debt, high return on equity companies are so attractive.  They dance around but never hit the correct answer.  This makes me wonder if they really understand it.  For the reader's future reference, once this simple fact is truly understood the investor is on his or her way to understanding investment.  Another difficulty is that there are mathematical errors in the book and simplistic mathematical calculations.  But the errors induced thereby are not large and no one seems to realize that the calculations are just a poor man's replacement for calculus.  As someone with a extensive mathematical background I find this perfectly acceptable.  Quite frankly, I have never needed more than simple algebra to understand investments anyhow so restricting the reader to this is good.  Also, some sections of the book wander about somewhat aimlessly trying to explain rather simple concepts.  I just think the authors don't have a quantitative background.  As I said above that is ok but these concepts can be explained better in words than they are in the book.  <br />Finally, other reviewers are correct.  Mary Buffett using Warren said this and Warren said that etc. throughout the book grates after a very few pages.  <br />But in the final analysis the book is worth the time and effort.  It is actually an attempt to make a basic valuation theory available to the masses so to speak and it does a very good job of this.  The book is definitely worth reading for those just starting out and in particular for those who think they understand investment but really don't.I will leave it to the reader's discernment as to who those individuals are.	2003-02-10

It is about a family that does some really cool things together like visit Mars and the asteroid belt.  They suffer some mishaps and adventures and have a generally great time.  I like to think this will be possible one of these days.  Too bad I won't live to see it.  Like in the Tom Swift series, the family is able to buy supplies and craft that would put NASA under a strain.  This juxtaposition of the impossible with the everyday possible is what makes this book both appealing and typically Heinlein.  Although a Heinlein &quot;juvenile&quot; book I seem to enjoy it now as much as when I first read it many many years ago.	2003-02-07

One of my granddaughters managed to make it to third grade in the Huntsville school system without knowing how to read or knowing the alphabet.  ( This is how I originally got involved.) She had straight As. There is nothing wrong with her except being cute and lively. Her teachers let her do whatever she wanted because she was so cute and sweet. I have spent from the third grade to the sixth grade trying to teach her to read using every technique under the sun. Nothing worked including hooked on phonics. Then I stumbled on the Magic Tree House series when she entered sixth grade. I started with book one and we have read about eight of the books. Yes, there is some repetition of Jack said Annie said. But she enjoyed the stories and stuck with it. We started in September and now she is bringing home sixth grade books and successfully reading them with a little help. Before she could not read three words in a row. She is now able to read her social studies book and her science book. The Magic Tree House series helps children make it over what appears to be a stumbling block for many: the transition from reading very simple kindergarden and first grade books to reading actual books with plots and real stories. Parents who are having problems in this department could do much worse than look to the Magic Tree House series.	2003-01-29

It is just chock full of ideas about bodybuilding, weightlifting, powerwalking, good nutrition and just plain living.  Try the Steve Reeves power drink.  The only problem I have with the book is that Steve Reeves suggests doing over twenty exercises per day three days per week.  I don't know how many weeks a year he normally worked out but he admits that many years when making movies he only worked out maybe three months a year.  This regimen works without breaking you down for three months maybe, but surely not twelve months a year for many years.  In several places in the book it is insinuated that Steve did not always work out like perhaps he should.  According to him he never had trouble maintaining muscle mass because of his lifestyle.  So he slacked sometimes.  As a result he probably did not overtrain much.  This agrees with my personal experience also.  The pictures of Steve when he was sixteen show that he developed similar to Arnold just packing on the pecs and lats in virtually a single year.  It is too bad more do not follow the simple principles in this book.  Try his squat routine: work up to squating half your bodyweight 100 times.  That is my eventual goal and I am interested in what happens to my body in the meantime.  Some of the exercises may be a little old but they will still work.  Overall a very honest readable and usable book.	2003-01-29

Several sections were written many years ago. Home video cameras are considered new technology in the book. Also, the emphasis on Nautilus machines makes me suspicious that even more of the sections are very old. There are other examples I will not go into here. <br />Mike Mentzer attempts to use objectivist philosophy and \\"scientific\\" logic to prove that HIT is the only way to go to fully realize ones \\"genetic potential\\". Therein lies the fault. One can apply all the reason in the world to biology but without careful experimentation the results are at the outside best uncertain. No experimental results are presented or referenced. Only anecdotal evidence is presented. This seems to be par for the course for HIT. If I was a true believe I would use all experimental evidence in existence to convince others. The lack of this evidence makes me believe HIT is more like a religion. Now that I have said this I will admit that HIT works. It works for me and I have seen others for whom it works. I just wish that Mentzer and the other HIT devotees would use more scientific evidence. One difficulty in particular I see in the logic is that recovery time is tremendously manipulated and is said to vary tremendously among individuals. But the response to exercise is said to vary very little among individuals. I don't believe this. I do believe that recovery time, response to exercise and other variables can be manipulated to increase the effectiveness of weightlifting for the individual. I also doubt that that 40 min of exercise a week is enough. Also, overtraining is overemphasized as in the hardgainer materials. I have found it is actually quite difficult for me to overtrain and I am a classic ectomorph/hardgainer. The \\"overtraining\\" methods in Arnold's book seem to work just as well for me as the hardgainer methods. Most of these other methods just add variety and I don't have to work out 6 days a week to get it all in.<br />The section on posing does not compare well with Arnold's in the Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding but has some info strict bodybuilders will find interesting. The section on using mirrors looks like it could really be useful for some. The book also contains some good motivational material and it is evident that Mike Mentzer was a great mentor. <br />Regardless of its faults the book is relatively well written and well thought out. It is a good presentation of the HIT mentality. Just be wise and realize that HIT is not the end all be all. Other methods work just as well.	2003-01-29

But the content is good.  The book is probably more motivational than anything else.  It does tell the truth about the bodybuilding magazines but it also contains some diet information, a sample flexible workout routine, and a bit of humor.  It is by no means the best book out there but it makes you want to get out there and pump iron.  Any book that does that cannot be all bad.  I really enjoyed the website so I bought the book.  There is some overlap but the book is not just a copy of the website.  I only wish he had included the beefs from the website which I enjoy reading.  Anyhow the book is about natural bodybuilding and contains some information on the truth about several popular supplements.  It is not a must have  but the owner will not have anything to complain about except price.	2003-01-26

Then, when all return to the Outpost, each tells his story and the reader can see for himself the embellishments and understatements.

The parables center around ancient Babylon and both successful and unsuccessful members of that kingdom.  One of the great advantages of the book is that it provides extemely useful advice for many people in a manner that is not sermonizing or preachy.

This book is different.  I believe every young person in particular should own one.	2003-01-16

I read a comment by a true believer somewhere that Eliot Wave theorists can make predictions when nobody else can.  They can - just as people who lead seances can talk to the dead when nobody else can.  However, the author is honest and at least admits that he could be wrong.  The best part of this book is the second half on how to handle your money in a deflationary environment.  The advice is first rate but does plug several organizations.  This is probably ok as they are the only organizations that perform the particular services under consideration.  I just think you should be able to handle your own money.  One other point: the basic assumption in this book is that the stock market can be described using fractals.  It could be true and other books make the point as well.  But I  once worked with ion channels isolated from various animals including humans.  One author proved conclusively that ion channels are best described by fractal dynamics.  All kinds of convincing evidence was provided and a great hoopla followed.  The only problem was that a tremendous amount of incontrovertible evidence existed from a wide range of experiments using all types of techniques that ion channels are Markovian.  I have found though my own hard experience that it is very difficult to show something is fractal in nature.  Most of the original examples were rather cut and dried.  It is all too easy to see fractals everywhere: even where none exist.  So until the fractal boys are able to prove something really long term about the stock market and make themselves filthy stinking rich, I will remain sceptical.	2003-01-12

The rest is not really up to par but will probably pass most people's inspection. Please just be skeptical and wise and realize that to take advantage of mechanical stock picking schemes requires a great deal of money or a fund of some kind.

It covers an extremely broad range of topics and for the most part the reader cannot go too far wrong following the author's advice. The sections on the nature of markets and his advice on commodities alone makes the book worthwhile. Bear in mind that the book was published in 1994 but most of the content is timeless. Another book with much of the same advice is The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need by Andrew Tobias.  One additional thing- some of the charts and tables and examples date from the 1970's and are evidently from magazine articles that the author wrote.  Just so you know what you are buying. The example are good ones and mostly remain relevant today.  The only real limitation of the book is Train's simplistic approach to growth stock picking.	2003-01-04

The book is divided into many different situations and types of people and this is useful. However many sections are very shallow and it seems that the sections that deal with the most difficult people tend to blame it on the recipient rather than the perpetrator. Also, there is a tendency to helplessness in the face of the worst offenders, i.e. there is nothing you can do. In reality this is seldom the case.

Some reviewers have pointed out that the routines lead to overtraining.  However, the book continually emphasizes tailoring the routines and ideas to your own individual needs.  It does not promote the use of drugs.  Overtraining is a highly individual problem and actually serves a useful purpose for short periods of time.  Most of the routines presented are not for the average hack bodybuilder.  His introductory routines are for people in good shape with some experience.  They are a goal in their own right.  The book also serves the interests of beginners by providing great descriptions of the vast majority of bodybuilding exercises in existence.  Remember that the exercises have to be properly performed.  If not their value is greatly reduced.  So to even utilize the routines one must master the exercises.  I suspect that many will find that after building up to the routines they will not be overtraining.  Be very careful about signing up for the hardgainer mentality too quickly.  Also, the nutrition section is not that out of date.  It just emphasizes the basics which is all most people really need anyhow.	2002-12-29

I found this much more inspirational than Napoleon Hill's books. I believe Getty speaks very frankly in this book and from the heart. The only quibble is that he seems impervious to the racism that permeated the entire country during his tenure while deeply concerned about the other ills of his time. That is the only reason for my 4 stars.	2002-12-29
