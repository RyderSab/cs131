Internationally known cellist, teacher, author and poet Gordon Epperson wrote Sonnets From India while stationed there during World War II. They reflect the influence of the culture experienced first hand, after an early connection with Indian thought, the principles of yoga and the writings of Vivekananda and Aurobindo.<br />Each sonnet is a perception of truths that range from love and loveliness to heroes and heroines to the celebration of life. In Threshold, for instance, Mr. Epperson speaks (beautifully) to the sunrise---the beginning of a new day and his dreams. \\"I still have hopes that I may someday find/ What lies beyond departments of the mind.\\"<br />Here is poetry crafted to express the human condition, clearly. And while metaphysical in tone, Sonnets from India is not otherworldly but, instead, an insight into what can be. In The Good Things we read that bliss is not material. Instead they include, \\"...love of woman; child; exquisite power/ Of lucid thought, and music; home and law.\\"<br />Additionally, the reader will find nine free-form poems written in later decades. Five Oases is especially telling for this reviewer. Mr. Epperson writes, \\"Seek deliverance/ In printed words./ Travel/ Esoteric avenues/ Swallow vials/ Of curatives/ Prescribed by experts/ Knowing, known/ Tune up the viols/ Violence is abroad/ Seek deliverance/ In Hell. Or else/ Write off the Universe.\\"<br />Sonnets From India is the kind of book you can't put down. It grips your heart and your mind with thought that begets thought. Gordon Epperson is a very special being---and that is reflected in Sonnets From India.	2002-04-29

A brilliant man who lived in London, Mr. Gurney was a writer of articles about philosophy, psychology, religion, education, literature and the arts. Additionally, he was schooled in music (his passion), medicine and law and was a champion of both social justice and animal rights.<br />Gordon Epperson, author, professor emeritus of music at the University of Arizona and famed concert cellist has given us an insightful look at this man in his book, The Mind of Edmund Gurney. More than a biography, much more, The Mind of Edmund Gurney offers the reader an in-depth view of a man who was way ahead of his time. He was a friend to George Eliot, Samuel Butler, Henry Sedgwick, Leslie Stephen and William James, with whom Mr. Gurney had an extensive correspondence. It was through these letters that Professor Epperson was able to fashion a detailed and scholarly look at this complex and charismatic individual.<br />The Mind of Edmund Gurney presents a vivid picture of a dynamic person of extraordinary accomplishment. Even though he died at the early age of 41, he was able to study and write about hypnosis, psychic research, musical criticism---even poetry, in addition to everything else. He collaborated with F. W. H. Myers, author of Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death, in the first significant studies of hypnosis to appear in England, providing convincing evidence of telepathy. And all of this in a rather providential time in history. Professor Epperson writes, \\"His personality was powerful, his character complex. He had the capacity to enter into the thoughts and feelings of others, and he made a strong impression...on whomever he had to do with.\\"<br />The only way we have to meet Edmund Gurney is vicariously, through a well documented, thoughtful and provocative book entitled, The Mind of Edmund Gurney. Gordon Epperson has illuminated a life that might otherwise have been lost to history!	2002-04-29

Prolific author and seeker John McAfee in his provocative new book, Into the Heart of Truth, leads the reader to an understanding of real truth. Since truth is interpreted through our own conditioning---beliefs, fears, cravings and anticipations---how do we determine absolute truth? The answer is Relational Yoga, based on the principle of bringing the practice of yoga into our everyday activities.<br />This eye-opener is divided into three parts, all designed to enable us to understand and discover who we are. Part One, The Importance of Relationship, points out that \\"It is through relationship that we assert our personal identities, and it in the mirror of relationship that we see ourselves and know our natures.\\"<br />Part Two of In the Heart of Truth, The Fabric of the Self, discusses the conclusions we all form about ourselves---how and where self-image is created, and why. Mr. McAfee writes, \\"Any serious, earnest approach to the question \\"Who am I?\\" must begin with an understanding of this image of ourselves we have created.\\" Further, he suggests that our image of ourselves is dynamic, fluid and always changing based on our relationships.<br />The end section, Relational Yoga, is a compilation of thousands of years of wisdom that (perhaps) began with the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. We learn that, \\"...Relational Yoga is a mechanism of profound change--not just relationships to our loved ones, but our relationship to all of life.\\" A further understanding of Patanjali's wisdom can be found in Beyond the Siddhis---see my review.<br />John McAfee has given us enlightenment. Into the Heart of Truth illuminates the path to self-understanding and truth!	2002-04-08

For the first five years of his life, author Kelly Hartmann's son Edward was a sickly boy. Kelly brought him to doctor after doctor, hospital after hospital, looking for some medical reason for his seemingly endless and always transforming condition. It wasn't illness (at least not the kind doctors can help) at all---it was possession!<br />Enlightened Through Darkness is the true story of the evil forces that inhabited Edward's body---forces that caused him to act crazy---to hit, scream, curse and threaten. Forces that attacked not just Edward, but his dad, sister, mom and anyone else trying to understand, and help.<br />The violence and destruction, the fear and the episodes increased dramatically. Kelly and her husband Leo exhausted all the doctors and, even went to different churches for help, to no avail. Then Judy Goodman entered their lives, sent by God she said, and able to see both sides at all times.<br />Demons proliferated, as cruel and harmful as in the movie, The Exorcist---except this was true, this was real, and it was for Judy Goodman to use all her power to exorcise these creatures of hell from little Edward's body. And so, Enlightened Through Darkness is a page-turner of truth, about the battle of good versus evil, God versus Satan and light versus darkness.<br />\\"Sometimes we don't realize that there is an unseen world of existence around us. The reality of these things is not dependent on our knowledge or belief in them\\", writes author, seeker and mom Kelly Hartmann. Enlightened Through Darkness, in this reviewer's opinion, is a marvelous book, but beware---when you start reading it, be prepared. You won't be able to put it down until page 222, the end!	2002-04-08

Author, psychologist and metaphysician Eric Alsterberg writes about Life IS an Adventure, \\"Ultimately I have written this book to share how the path of joy can be manifested in our lives, so that we can create our lives as masterpieces of joy.\\" By combining equal parts of psychology, philosophy, metaphysics and spirituality, Dr. Alsterberg provides the reader the means to return to our true self, re-examine the basic truths and enter that path of joy.<br />The first part of Life IS an Adventure is devoted to understanding life's path. Included are explanations  of self-healing through self-love and self-worth, serendipity, and transformation, among other vital topics. This is followed by the recognition that Earth is a classroom that teaches us how to love one another to become co-creators with God. Dr. Alsterberg discusses the laws of the universe, cause and effect, responsibility, karma, grace, reincarnation, destiny and more. This, of course, leads to our mission and God's plan for us.<br />Part two of this provocative work deals with implementation and application---how what we have learned can be (and should be) put to use to help ourselves, our neighbors and our planet. Included are behavioral problems to choices, to gratitude and love and service. The concluding chapter, The Path of Joy, sums up this well-written and truly helpful guide. \\"Joyful living is facing all the challenges, adversities, opportunities and experiences. It is embracing life with an adventurous attitude and approach.\\"<br />Life IS an Adventure lights the light of transformation with an incandescence that is brilliant. In this reviewer's opinion, Eric Alsterberg, Ph.D. has given us the means to return to our true Self. Don't miss this one!	2002-04-08

Thoroughly recommended!	\\"Showing up is the metaphysical key that unlocks the portal to our higher selves and allows our soul to soar to heaven's door while still present in the here and now\\", write authors and seekers Stratton Horres and Michala Perreault. Their new book, Showing Up, enables the reader to reveal their true self and manifest their origin.<br />Showing Up shows us how to conquer our lower and outer self; how to embrace our inner soul of heart and emotion; and how to unite with our higher self, our divine nature. If you've ever been caught up in a life where success was called money or trappings; if you've ever felt an emptiness in your life from a lack of higher purpose; and if you've never been able to unite with your spirituality, here is a book you must read.<br />Authors Horres and Perreault have traveled the same road, from emptiness to enlightenment. Curiously, even though they lived but thirty miles apart, and studied many of the same sources of wisdom (Joseph Campbell, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sufism, Judaism and Christianity), they did not know each other until they met at a conference on Egyptology in Virginia Beach, Virginia.<br />Using their respective backgrounds and strengths, he a successful trial attorney, she an ordained minister, naturopathic healer and therapist, they have authored a book that is both empowering and illuminating. Showing Up is filled with practical guides to growth, and direct and empowering question and answer sections for the reader to truly see within.<br />Showing Up is about vision that \\"...resonates with your core truths, feels true for now so you can see it serving as a guiding force into your future.\\" Indeed, ask about the companion audio (same title), with the actual meditations described in the book! Thank you Stratton Horres and Michala Perreault for this most fascinating and dynamic work!	2002-04-08

Thoroughly recommended!	\\"...without a firm understanding of ourselves---who we are, how we relate to the world and why we do the things we do---we cannot possibly live life to its fullest.\\" Thus begins John McAfee's spiritual revelation, The Secret of the Yamas. Here is a masterful look at self-discovery and self-awareness from a practice that originated at least 2500 years ago.<br />Many people think of yoga as a technique to gain physical strength, flexibility and better health (asanas). However, Patanjali, who first documented the organized science of yoga 2500 years ago, wrote, \\"The union of the various parts of the mind is gained through control of the mind, and then the perceiver comes to consciousness of himself.\\" And so, The Secret of the Yamas helps teach the aspect of yoga that increases our understanding of ourselves, our relationships and our actions.<br />While most people are familiar with the first limb of yoga, asanas (postures), it is the second limb (yamas) that deals with behavior: guidelines about non-violence, non-stealing, chastity, absence of greed and truthfulness. Mr. McAfee points out that it is relatively easy to pretend about or imitate these positive characteristics. However, the beauty of The Secret of Yamas is learning the wisdom to understand Patanjali's true significance of these conditions of behavior.<br />Author and seeker John McAfee is the founder of the Relational Yoga Mandarim in Woodland Park, Colorado. He has taught self-discovery techniques for over 15 years. This has enabled him to not only understand and live yoga in its entirety, but to offer us a clear, concise and (surely) effective guide to life.<br />In this reviewer's opinion, The Secret of the Yamas is a must-read for everyone seeking self-discovery---everyone!	2002-04-08

If there was ever a book whose time has come, Partnerships Tools is it!<br />We live in a time of freedom in our relationships---now, more than ever. In the past we were expected to marry and stay married, no matter what. Now, the divorce rate is soaring and many couples have no idea why or what to do about it. Indeed. \\"They believe that somehow there is something wrong with them because they don't already know how to make their relationships work, that somehow their lack of skills means that they are inadequate or stupid.\\"<br />Help is here. Psychotherapist, consultant and author Alan Konell provides the means to deal with these new freedoms and for our needs for even more intimacy than ever. Partnership Tools enables the reader to make healthy choices and clear away old patterns to sustain and grow in our relationships. And this growth can only lead to evolution as human beings---individuals, families and the world.<br />In his easy-to-read writing style, Mr. Konell leads us to an understanding of 14 different tools for success. Partnership Tools includes forgiving, and requesting rather than complaining. We learn how to set boundaries, express appreciation, to be straight and share. And the evolution from conditional love to unconditional love: giving and receiving freely and making true commitments.<br />Alan's last chapter has to do with rituals in relationships. In this powerful segment we read how rituals help us step back and take the space we need to remember our connection to our partner. And to remember our commitments, \\"...to what was, what is and what will be. It is a celebration of achievement and an acknowledgement of our contribution, to each other.\\"<br />Partnership Tools is not just a good book, it is a great book. Alan Konell has provided a new set of tools to create dynamic and fulfilling relationships. This reviewer regards Partnership Tools as a must-read for better communications and happiness, one that you should run to get, not just walk!	2002-04-08

Oatman is a story of finding  truth and the understanding of what love is... \\"To just give and receive love equally for ourselves and others. Because we're all one! Loving equally...it's the equally that's the big step.\\"<br />R.S. Oatman takes a cast of characters in this fine novel, weaves them in and out through incarnations and reincarnations, and produces a beautiful tapestry of enlightenment. With each incarnation, the reader (along with the character) uncovers a nugget of truth that further opens the door to fulfillment.<br />At the base of it all is a mind opening aspect that unites the rest, and that is why we exist in the first place. From there, other whys fall into order. Why love? Why strive? Why yearn? UniverSoul Ways offers a rare and complete scenario, one of simple insight yet intricately rounded in wisdom. If this had been its only point, it would still have full ability to change lives. <br />As the characters enter the 22nd century, common ground rather than differences become the norm. Religion becomes not so much a code of conduct, but a channel of learning. New technology contends with familiar issues of fear. Medicine enters a heightened preventative mode. Crime and terror are pitted against evolved intelligence. Earth itself is evolving. Then what happens to it? To us? The logic will fill you with awe.<br />And so, UniverSoul Ways is not only about learning and love---it is about hope. In this reviewer's opinion, R.S. Oatman has given us a positive look at our future in a spellbinder of a novel that will keep you riveted!	2002-04-08

What do you think they'll say about you---on your gravestone? Do you care about meaning in life beyond meeting your daily needs? If you are looking to make sense of it all, Why Get Up in the Morning is a provocative book you'll want to read. Author Tom Kramlinger writes, \\"...the purpose of this book is to examine themes about the meaning of life and to offer some ideas about how you...can lay claim to your own personal meaning--something to live by, something to stand for.\\"<br />Why Get Up in the Morning offers illumination of the path from Having to Doing to Being---a path that is lined with both secular and religious bricks. Having includes someone to love and to be loved by someone; appreciating and enjoying beauty; finding and applying fairness; and, of course, humor.<br />Doing relates to achievement; making a contribution; seeing life as an adventure; following time honored traditions. More, Doing is about right and courage and honor. Kramlinger asks in one of the many question and answer segments found in each chapter, \\"When in your life did you struggle to do the right thing?\\"<br />The realm of Being, the most spiritual of the three, is about appreciating the wonder of existence; knowing the truth; growth through enlightenment; communion and unity with others; and discerning the value of \\"letting go\\" through the pilgrimage of life.<br />In his superbly written book, Tom Kramlinger offers wisdom and consciousness to the reader. Each chapter ends with questions that will get you to think---and after all, isn't that the mark of a great book?

On September 11, 2054 Ithran Nek-Hanan (aka Nick) of the planet Selrahc, crashed his space cruiser into a Florida field. In his new novel, Galactically Speaking, author Fred J. Klingenhagen tells the story of how and why Nek-Hanan was charged with Capital murder...and what Floridian Leddie Fenhadden learned about this extraterrestrial.<br />In a well-researched story and with a tongue-in-cheek writing style that is humorous as well as inventive, author Klingenhagen unfolds a story of life in the future, in the galaxies yet unknown to us, now. And, you will read, that life then is not altogether different from how we act, now.<br />Nick's mission to Earth is to determine whether the people of Earth are advanced enough to join the Galactic Association of Star Systems, ecologically, financially, socially and intellectually. And it's the Enforcement Department's mission to capture Nick and bring him back.<br />Thus the story unfolds, as do the wonderful characters that inhabit it, here and faraway. And these characters include the cats of Earth who are able to communicate with the extraterrestrials. That look of disdain you often see in a cat? Its real...they really do think of themselves as smarter than their human counterparts.<br />If you want to find out what happens in this page-turner, and how John F. Kennedy was involved (that's right, John F. Kennedy), read Galactically Speaking. In this reviewer's opinion, Fred Klingenhagen is the next Gene Roddenberry (but with a great sense of humor) and Galactically Speaking should be made into a major motion picture, its that good!	2002-04-08

The foundation of yoga, we learn in John McAfee's brilliant new book, Beyond the Siddhis, began somewhere between 2500 and 5000 years ago. It was then that the focus of humankind shifted from learning to do (build, hunt, sow ) to identity i.e. \\"Who am I?\\"<br />The Sutras of Patanjali, written about 2500 years ago in Sanskrit, are the earliest writings (siddhis) about not only the nature of consciousness, but the New Age mysticism dealing with magic rituals and supernatural powers so popular today. Prolific author and seeker John McAfee's intent \\"...is to peel back the layers of words that hides the truth beneath the Siddhis.\\" As you read this fine work, you will see he does this quite effectively.<br />Beyond the Siddhis is filled with truths and understanding. Patanjali's discussions of the Siddhis, originally called Vibhuti Pada, can be confusing, but Mr. McAfee sorts it out easily. Our relationship with the present moment \\"...becomes a tool that we use to create some future reality in which we will be something different.\\"<br />We learn that the past, present and future are not real. Only the eternal now exists. The process of becoming is an illusion. Mr. McAfee writes, \\"The true beauty of Patanjali's writing is that when we stop living in the past and future, when we stop creating images in our minds and living within them, then all time becomes now.\\" This is the real, the true, in which we can live fully.<br />Beyond the Siddhis is a masterful book about attainment. John McAfee, author of  The Secret of the Yamas (see my review), guides the reader to awareness, compassion, love and the means to ease the suffering in your existence.

Prolific author and seeker Jim Rosemergy offers an opposing view, that there is a common ground between the many God-ordained religions of the world: Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, etc.<br />In his vital new book, The Third Coming, Mr. Rosemergy writes, \\"The founders of these religions were spiritual giants who not only walked on earth and occasionally on water, they walked with God.\\" Further, he believes the same divine plan was given to each . \\"If there is only one God, it is logical to assume that there is only one divine plan.\\"<br />The Third Coming explores the common ground that is the cement of belief. Jim responds to the divisive concepts that have stood unchallenged for so long, concepts directly responsible for humankind  separating  from religion and even God. Here is a book that, instead of attempting to convert people to a particular sect, opens the door to spiritual awakening, which is the third coming and our destiny.<br />\\"What are the spiritual truths that govern our lives?\\" we are asked. The answer, espoused by the world's religions, and often affirmed by metaphysicians is, \\"There is only God.\\" This oneness is a fundamental truth of the universe and our diversity, our many differences, \\"...is part of the divine plan. Only by accepting these many differences will we be able to experience our oneness.\\"<br />The Third Coming enables the reader to envision a time without holy wars, hunger, strife and poverty. Jim Rosemergy has written about the commonalties of Buddha, Moses, Mohammed and Jesus. The Third Coming is a key to unlock the door to spiritual awakening. Don't miss it!	2002-04-08

While taking her oldest son to college, Becca learns about the jeweled path from another middle-aged mom. \\"It's the path all of us must travel. It is the journey of transformation at midlife.

Catherine MacDonald writes, oh so wisely and well, about the discovery of truth, beauty, enrichment, and happiness by finding trust and letting go of illusions and false beliefs. Instead of going home, Becca decides to stop and take a week for herself, to try to get her life together.<br />In this time by herself, Rebecca Rossi faces challenges as never before, meets people who seem to be put in her path and learns lessons about herself that she had long forgotten.

In the introduction of yet another insightful book from John McAfee we read, How we relate to experience---to suffering, love, death, loneliness and a host of other challenges life presents--defines who we are.  The Fabric of Self addresses ones relationship to the world and provides a means to pierce the veil of our own self-image.<br />The meditations in The Fabric of Self speak to the components of life, from awareness to love, from death to ego, and from ideals to truth. Each meditation is a bright light illuminating a path to immortality. For instance, Awareness is the fundamental force of change for the self. When we become aware, deeply and completely, of the attachments, prejudices, arrogance, bitterness, fears, and all other vanities that makeup our daily existence, then true change is realized.<br />In the section devoted to Love, Mr. McAfee writer, Without love you are an empty shell. You may work, hope, dream, seek riches and power, but your conflicts and suffering will continue. And on the subject of Healing we read, It is through questioning, with the burning desire to know the answer, that the truth is revealed. And it is ourselves whom we must question. This questioning of ourselves is the only road to a full healing of ourselves.<br />John McAfee has taught self-discovery techniques for more than 16 years. His knowledge and abilities are rooted in truths that are 2500 years old. This reviewer suggests you read his other books, The Secret of the Yamas, Into the Heart of Truth, and Beyond the Siddhis (see my reviews) for additional insight about his wisdom.<br />The Fabric of Self, in this reviewers opinion, is a door opener, and that door leads to a life of fullness and joy.

In his finely honed novel, The Guru Of Malad, author Gordon Epperson weaves a tale of life in Georgia in 1936---a life of gentility, grace and manners, at least on the surface. But underlying this superficiality are real characters suffering real problems that the reader can align and commiserate with.<br />Dr. Robert Dowland returns to Malad from New York City, not quite the success he wanted to be. This physician, pianist, poet and literary critic returns to his roots to, hopefully, accept the Presidency of Cherokee College and the success he so needed.<br />Gordon Epperson fills his richly inspired book with a well defined and developed assortment of people, each in their own situation, and each leading lives (like us) that are filled with joy, sadness and frustration. One of these characters is a black lady, Doris Williams, hired to be Dr. Dowland's part time housekeeper and cook. At his first sight of Doris, \\"...he felt the breath go out of him.\\"<br />And so we have a story of life in the South in the 30's; race relations in the South in the 30's; and one man's image of himself as cosmopolitan, rid of narrow prejudices, who wants very much to be president of a college that did not even admit blacks.<br />This reviewer could not stop turning the pages of this epic story. Each was a revelation of what was (and could be)---all leading to enlightenment, fulfillment and a miraculous epiphany. Gordon Epperson, internationally known cellist. teacher, poet and story teller has used all of his wisdom and knowledge to produce this heroic novel.

If a good book holds your interest; and a great book gets you to think, then Inner Path Leadership is a truly great book! Author, entrepreneur, businessman and counselor Paul F. Sincock shows us where we came from---what we are now---and how to change if we are save ourselves and our planet.<br />Mr. Sincock writes, \\"We humans are impacting the earth's internal processes, in ways we do not yet understand. We don't understand the implications of what we are doing or the long-term unexpected consequences.\\" But lest you think that Inner Path Leadership is about doom, it is not. Paul's message is of hope via change, new ideas, and new vision.<br />For instance, about violence we read, \\"By holding onto anger, hostility, resentment and other negative emotions, we actually help generate a negative field of energy that influences others.\\" Like our neighbors, friends and family. And, yes like our children. What to do? \\"We bring forth alternatives that work better.\\"<br />Conflict resolution in ourselves and between each other is a key, and how to do that is explored in Inner Path Leadership. Here are the protocols for conflict resolution, not generally found in other books on this vital subject. We learn to understand our emotions, honestly. \\"The intention and desire to gain self knowledge and the faith that you can and will deal with everything uncovered, is crucial.\\"<br />Paul F. Sincock has illuminated the path to transformation and thus, enlightenment. Further, Inner Path Leadership is written in a conversational format that enables the reader to see the reality of our daily lives. And finally, Paul has given us a deeply spiritual look at how and why we can love ourselves and our neighbors. Inner Path Leadership is a lesson in hope!	2002-04-08

In her carefully crafted page-turner of a novel, Carlys People, author Ann Hildreth paints a picture of chaos, and living life in that chaos. If youve ever wondered about reality; if youve ever wondered about what is real and not real; and if youve ever had trouble telling one from another, here is a book youll not be able to put down.<br />The protagonist, Carly Worthington is a 43 year old ad agency art director, not to mention an alcoholic and a  bar prowler whose alter-ego, Wicked Sister continually leads her to  destruction. Carlys life---her feeble attempts at happiness---is made up of drinking and sleeping around with older men. The why of her life, the reason for Carlys path to self-destruction is her alcoholic, dysfunctional mother, and the background for this transforming story of self-rescue. And since Carly cannot admit this to herself, it is Wicked Sister who takes the blame.<br />Like a freight train speeding down the track to a terrible destination, Carlys People barrels through Carlys rape and beating. Her moms heart attack signals a change in track to a new destination, revelation. And the track man is the Blue One in a ... conscious level that is neither dream  nor material reality to which your human body is accustomed. It is these Blue People, call them angels or Christed Ones, that teach Carly a self-directional guide to individual higher expression---Recognize, Confront, Forgive and Release---words we can all live by.<br />Carly learns the truth, ...the simple, pristine pathway to Increase of Light... It is the One law of the Law of One. It is the track to salvation and understanding. And so, Carlys People is about forgiveness, the beginning of healing. With the wisdom of all time, Ann Hildreth writes, There is the bridge that spans the waters of forgiveness that flows throughout eternity; you cannot cross over the River of Forgiveness until youre ready to go to the other side. Carly was finally ready!	2002-04-08

The foundation of yoga, we learn in John McAfee's brilliant new book, Beyond the Siddhis, began somewhere between 2500 and 5000 years ago. It was then that the focus of humankind shifted from learning to do (build, hunt, sow ) to identity i.e. \\"Who am I?\\"<br />The Sutras of Patanjali, written about 2500 years ago in Sanskrit, are the earliest writings (siddhis) about not only the nature of consciousness, but the New Age mysticism dealing with magic rituals and supernatural powers so popular today. Prolific author and seeker John McAfee's intent \\"...is to peel back the layers of words that hides the truth beneath the Siddhis.\\" As you read this fine work, you will see he does this quite effectively.<br />Beyond the Siddhis is filled with truths and understanding. Patanjali's discussions of the Siddhis, originally called Vibhuti Pada, can be confusing, but Mr. McAfee sorts it out easily. Our relationship with the present moment \\"...becomes a tool that we use to create some future reality in which we will be something different.\\"<br />We learn that the past, present and future are not real. Only the eternal now exists. The process of becoming is an illusion. Mr. McAfee writes, \\"The true beauty of Patanjali's writing is that when we stop living in the past and future, when we stop creating images in our minds and living within them, then all time becomes now.\\" This is the real, the true, in which we can live fully.<br />Beyond the Siddhis is a masterful book about attainment. John McAfee, author of  The Secret of the Yamas (see my review), guides the reader to awareness, compassion, love and the means to ease the suffering in your existence. It sheds a brilliant light on the core of ourselves!	2002-04-08

In this highly competitive, dog-eat-dog world, is it still possible to achieve financial prosperity while maintaining spiritual integrity? The answer found in Cecil O. Kemp's latest book, 7 Laws of Highest Prosperity, is a resounding yes!<br />Mr. Kemp has interwoven a fable with simple truths to create a tapestry of insight that can enable the reader to understand the co-existence of both monetary and spiritual values. <BR>7 Laws of Highest Prosperity is the story of Sam the Wood Gatherer who finds better ways of doing business, increasing his profits from the same labor, contributing to his community's well-being and becoming a guidepost on the road called inspiration.<br />The 7 laws represented in this well-written and valuable lesson to transformation are amazingly obvious, yet many of us are simply too busy to recognize them. They start with the Law of Wisdom---\\"The highest wisdom resides in God's supreme thought and love.\\" All the other laws follow once we understand this truism.<br />The Laws of Priority, Motive, Generosity, Understanding, Preparation and Preservation describe the successes that can occur for us, our families, our communities and our future generations. Author and seeker knows from first hand experience. The lessons he learned while being a successful CPA, Chief Financial Officer, entrepreneur and co-owner (with Patty, his wife of 30 years) of investment services companies, are applied to this fine book. Indeed, it seems Mr. Kemp could be a 21st century Sam the Wood Gatherer.<br />7 Laws of Highest Prosperity is about making a living but more importantly, its about making a life. In this reviewer's opinion, Cecil O. Kemp Jr. has given us a work of inspiration and a means to find true prosperity!	2001-11-05

The young girl on the book cover looks into a mirror and sees the many perceptions of herself, which include a beautiful, mature woman, a cheerleader, and a tomboy. Authors Sloan and Jones, of Whose Reality Mine or Yours?, give us a new insight about behavior and therefore a means to the truth.<br />\\"We form our basis of reality on what we perceive as real, yet perception is based on experiences and beliefs that we have been taught are true and real\\" begins this excellent work. It follows that our personalities are a reflection of this programming. Sloan states, \\"Once you understand how programs are created, you can learn how they can be reprogrammed with immediate results\\".<br />Hypnosis is the key that unlocks the door to behavior modification and in this presentation, the myths about its efficacy and value are quelled. Stanley Sloan writes, \\"Hypnosis is a non-critical state of suggestibility with increased awareness, between awake and asleep, which occurs during the process of storing, retrieving, and processing information\\".<br />Unlike most other books about behavior modification and hypnosis, Whose Reality Mine or Yours? clearly explains the brain's functions. Then, and only then, can we understand both the myths and the truths of what is this ancient practice. Authors Sloan and Jones answer our questions i.e. How does hypnotherapy work? What is a post-hypnotic suggestion? Can I have major personality changes overnight?<br />This reviewer found Whose Reality Mine or Yours? to be thoughtful, provocative, profound and healing as well as  a wonderful learning experience. A nice surprise come with the book, the General Behavior Change CD recorded in both author's voices. It provides scripts and exercises of an abstract therapeutic session.	2001-11-05

We're adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through fossil fuel burning, creating holes in the protective ozone layer,  decimating forested lands, contaminating land and water, and ever-increasing our population.<br />Wholeness explores options for a brighter future--indeed salvation from an ultimate destruction. Author, visionary, and educator Alex Gerber Jr. demonstrates the theories of the famous inventor/philosopher Buckminster Fuller and the principles of spirituality found in Tao, and offers a means to understand where we are globally, as well as locally and individually, and what we can do about it.<br />Dr. Gerber writes, \\"`The whole' refers to everything--the entirety of creation, all that is, undivided, without diminution.\\" By learning to view the world's many facets (e.g., ecology, energy, economics, ethics, and education) not as parts but as an integrated whole, we can begin to live in accord with each other and with nature rather than in fragmentation, discord, and self-destruction.<br />Focusing particularly on design (in the fullest sense of the word), education, and spirituality, Gerber shows us how Buckminster Fuller's philosophy of  \\"comprehensivity\\" helps us to connect with and act in accord with the whole. He then presents the timeless philosophy of Tao as a complement to Fuller's that encourages continual connection with \\"the oneness of being\\" and teaches us, as Gerber puts it, \\"to exist and act in that state of wholeness.\\"<br />Wholeness: On Education, Buckminster Fuller, and Tao is an awakening to a better way. Here is a book intended for the broadest spectrum of people--those seeking to  navigate in this complex and often bewildering world. Wholeness is far and away the best book this reviewer has ever read on this vital subject. Alex Gerber Jr., in his exceptional, timely offering, has given us a means to see the forest before there are no trees.	2001-11-05

Such is It's Really a New Age. Author and visionary Allen Eric Firesong has written a page-turner that has major motion picture all over it.<br />Here is a story about peace, love, sharing and spiritual awakening. Imagine three groups of people who live their lives as seekers, bringing and sharing their dreams of a new millenium and a better way...to a nature festival. And then there is the government agent, so hurt, so angry and so hateful...he wants to destroy them, and all that they stand for.<br />Mr. Firesong offers a tale of transformation from hate to love---from darkness to light. This reviewer also found a cast of clearly defined characters whose lives and personalities are interwoven like a fine tapestry. One group lives on the land in harmony with nature. Add another of city folk involved in the holistic movement. And then add a group from a commune, immersed in healing and spiritual growth.<br />They all met at an annual nature festival intent on achieving an integration of their truths and a beacon for a new way of living. Will the government special agent succeed with his plan to poison them by going far beyond the dreadful plan authorized by his superiors?<br />This reviewer eagerly turned 201 pages to the conclusion of a well-written book, and a message of hope. It's Really a New Age is exciting, awakening, and consciousness-raising. Allen Eric Firesong has given us a special book, one that combines a great story with a message of enlightenment.

A good children's book is usually regarded as one that tells a story, holds the child's attention and often distracts the child from doing something else. A great children's book does all of that and teaches a valuable lesson as well. By this definition, Clayton's Path is a great children's book.<br />Clayton is a pack mule, very sturdy and very kind. But Clayton's eyes are weak so he can't see the trail very well. Indeed, Clayton is short-sighted in many ways; overly friendly and impulsive, always playing; and not concentrating on his tasks while annoying the other pack mules. And so, Clayton feels different, alone and separated from his friends.<br />In this meaningful parable, Clayton goes off on his own and meets an old man who cannot walk well, but can see well. And so they traveled together with the old man serving as the eyes, and Clayton serving as the legs. Clayton told his companion, \\"I am short-sighted and sometimes I do not know I have done something wrong until it is too late.\\"<br />The old man teaches, \\"Mistakes are within all of us, but they can be lessened through guidance.\\" Further, Clayton learns that there is a time and place for everything. But the biggest and best lesson of all is that we are all special in one way or another and we can all feel good even though we may be different from the pack.<br />Clayton's Path offers this wisdom in a heart-warming, colorful and loving fashion. Consider that there are only a few truly great children's books and Brett, Laura and Mona have given us one of them. Here is a must-read for the health and happiness of our children, one this reviewer wishes existed sixty years ago!	2001-11-05

Here is the companion book to Beyond Belief Into Knowing (see my review). A Soul's Delight provides information, guidance, inspiration, resources and activities to enable the reader to attune to their Soul through The Higher Self Integration Process.<br />While Beyond Belief Into Knowing chronicles author and healer JoyBeth's life from hardship to Light...A Soul's Delight assembles her monumental learning experiences for you, thus illuminating your path to  achieve a healthy, happy and joyful reality.<br />A Soul's Delight takes you to an understanding of who you are, who God is, and how to remove the blocks that separate. And then JoyBeth smoothes the road to growth through the levels of Soul Consciousness to find Truth, and the power and wisdom that Truth provides. All the while, throughout this divine work, the reader is provided with source materials for additional reading, as well as the exercises to help absorb all you can attain.<br />This reviewer's education was enhanced by the clearly and lovingly written sections devoted to chakras, reflexology, the human aura, acupressure, appropriate diet regimens and yoga exercises...all leading to energy management. JoyBeth writes, \\"Soul Attunement or higher self integration is all about SELF-MASTERY\\". A Soul's Delight leads the way from our lower-self personality to our higher-self personality which allows our Soul's true voice a clear channel.<br />If you've wanted to meet an achiever and understand her road to development, this reviewer advises you to read both Beyond Belief Into Knowing and A Soul's Delight. JoyBeth speaks to the human condition and the discovery of the \\"more\\" in more to life. Both are required reading for transformation!	2001-11-05

Have you ever thought, \\"There must be more to life than this?\\" JoyBeth did, early on in her life and began her journey to discovery, recovery and true self. This wonderful, autobiographical delight, Beyond Belief Into Knowing, describes her classroom on Earth and her education of Soul Consciousness.<br />JoyBeth's life included a sexually-abusive biological father from whom she was rescued  at age 3. She contracted non-contageous tuberculosis, and later, Lupus. If that's not enough, she was crippled by Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis which finally went into remission at age 13. And when her mom remarried, her stepdad continued the abuse and beatings!<br />Life can be cruel, and some people never get past the cruelty, which seems to feed on itself and grow...and take over one's self. But JoyBeth is special. She's a survivor. And she has the innate psychic ability to know the future, and understand the human dilemma. Indeed, this insight...this wisdom is what takes Beyond Belief Into Knowing from a simple autobiography to an overview of a catharsis, healing and revelation.<br />Marriage, finding a permanent and perfect place to live, and the return of what was diagnosed as Rheumatoid Arthritis presented more than enough stress for ordinary people. But not JoyBeth. You see, this extraordinary being continually explores spiritual dimensions and achieves integration with her Higher Self and thus, Soul Consciousness. A miracle...perhaps for some...but not for this counselor, educator, healer and metaphysician.<br />JoyBeth continues to learn the way to live life, and continues to offer her wisdom for our guidance. Beyond Belief Into Knowing and its companion workbook, A Soul's Delight (see my review) should be added to your must-read list. You'll find new meaning in the words courage and enablement!	2001-11-05

Author, educator, editor and publisher Ron Miller uses his unique talents to present a brilliant overview of holistic education as a radical alternative to the assumptions, purposes and methods of conventional schooling. Caring for New Life discusses fulfillment of life's true purpose and delivers a series of essays that offer beams of light that illuminate educating our children in other and better ways.<br />While current educational systems seem to focus on the individual and a goal of financial success, Caring for New Life presents the views of prominent educators with a global view that include the whole self, spiritual as well as physical. For instance, Maria Montessori said, \\"The world was not created for us to enjoy, but we are created to evolve the cosmos.\\"<br />Mr. Miller says, \\"Holism asserts that everything exists in relationship, in context of connection and meaning--and that any change or event causes a realignment, however slight, throughout the entire pattern.\\" thus holism brings together rather than separates as \\"...a spiritual quest for compassion and peace.\\"<br />Caring for New Life assembles the words and thoughts of Thoreau, Steiner, Wilber, Krishnamurti and Palmer (to name only a few), that education should serve purposes other than national defense and the manpower requirements of the corporate economy. Ron Miller cogently and effectively presents the logic of and the need for a more liberating educational system.<br />Here is an enlightening book that probes and asks fundamental questions that cause the reader to ponder about the human consequences of our educational policies. In this reviewer's opinion, the hallmark of a great book is that it gets you to think. Caring for New Life is a great book!	2001-11-05

Some people never embrace their life experiences and therefore, never learn. And others, like writer and teacher Ellen Braverman absorb the joys, the sadness', the ups and downs and not only learn---they share their wisdom with the rest of us. And that's what One Woman's Journey Towards Self is all about.<br />Ellen gives us, in beautiful poetic  metre, a sampling of her fears, her searching, the horrors and the blessings of life. For instance, about searching (Many Roads) we read, \\"Many roads/ many paths/ which one should I take?/ Does it really matter?/ or/ do they all lead to the same place?/ a/ new beginning.\\"<br />And about fear, Ellen writes, \\"I didn't come here to always be in fear./ I came/ to experience/ the joy/ of being human/ on this Earth/ at this time/ no matter/ what!\\". Her poem, Love is about blessings, \\"Loving yourself/ is/ the greatest/ gift/ you can/ give/ to/ yourself\\".<br />Ellen's poem about horror is titled I Am the Jew and it speaks to the holocaust. \\"Mountains of bones/ of burnt flesh/ of gassed men, women and children/ of empty holes./ I am the Jew/ who shoveled this/ all into/ one neat pile./ I am the Nazi/ who ordered the Jew/ to shovel all this/ into one neat pile./ I am the Jew/ and/ I am the Nazi/ that I see standing before/ me.\\"<br />One Woman's Journey Towards Self is poetry that is heartfelt and as timeless as humanity.

This world is a better place because author, environmentalist, telepath and Reiki Master Diana Siderides found hers. Flight to Freedom is the story of her travels through difficulties that could conquer most of us---but made Diana all the more focussed, resolute and caring.<br />Diana was thrown from a horse, landed on her head and technically died several times while being airlifted to the hospital. And some years after that, she caught her right hand and arm in a chipper machine at the sawmill where she worked, and lost most of the use of both. After many surgeries, and while recuperating with her parents in New Jersey, she volunteered part time at a wildlife refuge, learned rehabilitation techniques, and was certified as a Wildlife Rehabilitator.<br />Thus began her second journey and the discovery of her reason for being. In short order, Diana established Flight to Freedom, Inc., a sanctuary and rehab program for injured wild birds of prey. She not only treats and repairs them---she educates us about birds of prey and their unique role in nature.<br />Flight to Freedom is about saved birds and their reintroduction back to the wild. Diana writes, \\"Choosing to become a Raptor Rehabilitator is a lifetime commitment that can't be taken lightly. It involves caring for the injured raptors day and night, seven days a week, fifty-two weeks a year...I have learned so much about myself through these beautiful raptors. My life has become more valuable because of what they have taught me\\".<br />Diana Siderides set her handicaps aside and used her strengths, knowledge and love to help creatures in trouble. Flight to Freedom is an excellent book that describes her life---and offers us the opportunity to help, too!	2001-11-05

We don't seem to hear the expression, \\"And they lived happily ever after\\" any more, except in old fairy tales. Why is that? What can be done to turn it around? The answers to these questions can be found in William Oak's insightful new book, For Love or Nothing.<br />Here is a compilation of 25 short allegorical stories that illustrate the necessary and various parts of love. The lessons contained in each story are not only lessons for life, they are lessons for a lifetime relationship. Mr. Oak, who learned the composition of love from his mother as she was dying of cancer, relates this wisdom in short, well-written fables.<br />For instance, in Labyrinth we learn that  love is giving, and sometimes giving means giving in.  And in The Sowing Fields  the lesson is that one must sow love to reap love...but only by daily cultivation will the harvest be abundant.<br />For Love or Nothing teaches us about forgiveness---as Peter Ustinov said, \\"Love is an act of endless forgiveness\\", as well as compassion, selflessness, growth, sharing and the requirement for each to feed the relationship. Mr. Oak deftly and perfectly introduces concepts of trust, appreciation and the awareness that we each are entitled to be different.<br />For Love or Nothing is a means to seek out, and find a path to happiness, peace and contentment.

This exploration of energy (vibration) as it relates to modern medicine...the Newtonian viewpoint and the Einsteinian viewpoint, combined with Dr. Gerber's keen writing abilities, offer the reader a deeply esoteric look at the future of medicine.<br />Further, Vibrational Medicine, Third Edition discusses the efficacy of such ancient treatments as acupuncture, radionics, healing with crystals, Bach flower remedies, chakras, meditation and psychic healing. We learn about the relationship between higher vibrational energies and physical matter to understand the patterns governing the flow of the life-force through the physical body.<br />The marriage of homeopathy and modern medicine signals the verge of a major paradigm shift in the sciences. \\"Ideally\\", writes Dr. Gerber, \\"each therapeutic option offered by the different schools of thought might be used to complement and augment the effectiveness of the others, as opposed to relying on any single technique. This integrated model is one which may eventually be extended towards treating all forms of disease in a multidisciplinary fashion\\".<br />Vibrational Medicine, Third Edition, is a look at the future as it will affect our lives individually as well as globally.

Like Toto, we learn to love unconditionally. Scarecrow teaches us discovery and acceptance of self. And the Tin Man shows us how to utilize the wisdom in our hearts instead of a heavy-handed ax.<br />Golden Wizdom Beyond the Emerald City uses the Cowardly Lion character to teach us how to return to the true self we were meant to be.

Our outer layers may meet, but our longing to be deeply connected remains unfulfilled.\\"<br />When we shed these mantles of protection we become more capable of being nonreactive, openhearted and loving in our relationships. Authors Psaris and Lyons show us how to do this by eliminating the preoccupations we substitute for relationships, determining what it is we really want, and dissolving our defenses.<br />Undefended Love teaches us that, \\"Instead of trying to maintain a sense of harmony by limiting who we are, we embrace our partners as intimate allies.\\" What a splendid goal because it leads to the discovery that we are all one vast, loving, universal heart. In this reviewer's opinion, Undefended Love is the roadmap to that goal, and the transformation to become whole!	2001-11-05

If you read only one book this year, and you would like a book that puts you in touch with the Spirit within you---this reviewer recommends O and I. It is the story of the author's discovery of Orifi, an intelligence from another dimension whose wisdom, insight and humor led Alfred Schwab to another and better place.<br />O and I tells of the personal relationship between Orifi and the author---and the growth that both enjoy from their discussions. For instance, Schwab asks, \\"Are we only here within this reality to learn how to escape from it?\\" Orifi responds, \\"...the physical experience is adding tremendously to your personal growth and understanding. The process of becoming physical, then understanding the physical level, then learning to detach from it, then learning eventually to separate from the physical reality, is an awesome one...it can only be conceived of in stages as it unfolds.\\"<br />A good book tells a good story while a great book gets you to think. O and I gets you to think-- and understand that we are not alone. We are all connected to the universe, and God or Spirit or I AM or whatever you call it, resides within each of us. The author shares his realization of that truth, and the journey and learning experiences along the way, in this great book.<br />Orifi and Schwab speak to each other as brothers, both on an equal footing, and both learning about each other, and both teaching each other. O and I is certainly well written (the words and logic seem to slide down like Jello), focussed, humorous and intelligent. In this reviewer's opinion, Alfred Schwab has given us a book about love and respect---the ingredients necessary for growth. Don't miss O and I, it can change your life!	2001-11-05

Getting Real is an honest and straightforward book about freedom.  Many of us, perhaps most of us, learn from early childhood experiences that it's not safe to be ourselves.  We take on false beliefs that become part of our adult lives.  This book shows us, step by step, how to free ourselves from the need to control how others view us and find the<BR>freedom that comes from \\"relating\\" as opposed to \\"controlling.\\"<br />The book is organized around 10 truth skills that help us learn to communicate authentically and discover that \\"we are most loveable when we are most transparent.\\"  When we speak from our own experience instead of from our judments and interpretations, we enter the realm of the here-and-now.  We learn to communicate our honesty with presence and compassion, instead of trying to prove ourselves right.<br />Dr. Campbell, a corporate consultant and seminar leader, has found that when people practice these skills, their fear of speaking honestly dissolves.  They develop an unshakeable sense of inner safety and security, so they no longer need to control other peoples' opinions or reactions.<br />Indeed, Getting Real teaches us everything from how to experience reality and how to be transparent (feeling good about revealing your true self) to how to assert your wants and how to embrace silence in a relationship.  Dr. Campbell writes, \\"Profound things happen when two people sit face-to-face and openly explore their feelings toward each other in the present.\\" Susan Campbell, Ph.D. has, in this reviewer's opinion, given us the ability to see and appreciate our true selves!	2001-11-05

A must-read book!	\\"In the world of vibrational medicine, illness is thought to be caused by not only germs, chemical toxins, and physical trauma but also by chronic dysfunctional emotional-energy patterns and unhealthy ways of relating to ourselves and to other people\\" writes physician, metaphysician, scientist and seeker Richard Gerber.<br />In his insightful new book, Vibrational Medicine for the 21st Century, Dr. Gerber succinctly and effectively explains to the lay person various ways in which humans are really more than merely biomachines. He describes the integral relationship between our minds and bodies and how, when the level of balance of our emotional-energy is disturbed, physical changes and weaknesses that contribute to disease, can occur.<br />This companion book to Vibrational Medicine, Third Edition, speaks to you and I in language we can understand. We learn what vibrational medicine is and how it is becoming recognized by modern medical doctors as a path to health and wellness.<br />Vibrational Medicine for the 21st Century is complete...this reviewer found discussions about chakras, homeopathy, acupuncture, flower essence and color and light healing, magnetobiology, radionic and hands-on techniques. Further, this information is presented by a passionate physician who is also a truth-seeker unbridled by scientific ethnocentrism.<br />Vibrational Medicine for the 21st Century is a bright light that illuminates the path to a new (though sometimes ancient) frontier of medicine. Dr. Gerber offers scientific evidence from case studies that prove the efficacy of combining modern medicine with alternative medical treatments. In this reviewer's opinion, this book is a valuable tool to understanding a better and cutting edge means to achieve better health and wellness!	2001-11-05

It was intriguing for this reviewer that I, a Pisces, have a ray 1 soul and personality . I discovered much about myself, especially that my character weaknesses (and there are many) can be transmuted into strengths--and Ruth Mierswa told me how! And so it is for all signs.<br />So many people are hurting! They want to know, \\"Why me? Why did this happen to me?\\" <BR>This book explains why they have these experiences and how these experiences are opportunities for spiritual growth. You'll be shown how to rid yourself of anger, guilt, and other harmful emotions on both a conscious and unconscious level.<br />Ruth Mierswa has given us a book that answers many of your \\"why\\" questions e.g. why some people are born talented or with a superior intellect. Who You Are and Why You Are Here identifies your level of evolvement and gives you the means to evolve higher. In the doing, by changing weaknesses into strengths, you'll be better able to help humankind---and that's why we're here!	2001-10-26

In his newest and most far-reaching book, author, scholar, teacher and gemologist Howard Beckman offers, \\"...a far more complete understanding of how gems distribute the cosmic colors of the rainbow, and what their effects are on the body and mind\\". While many people think of gemstones as only symbolic of wealth and beauty, Vibrational Healing With Gems presents gems as therapy in an important Vedic approach to wholeness and well-being.<br />Mr. Beckman relates in this eye-opening work, \\"Natural, untreated gemstones which are repositories of cosmic colors can restore the pranic energy to the cells of the body so that their natural vibratory rate may be regained, and normal health may be regained when the body is in a diseased condition\\".<br />The healing gemstones; ruby, red coral, emerald, diamond, hessonite, pearl, yellow sapphire, blue sapphire and chrysoberyl cat's-eye contain all the cosmic colors referenced in ancient Vedic literature, indeed thousands of years old. These colors and vibrational potencies, medicines and clinical healing from gems are all brought to light by Mr. Beckman in this well-written and easy-to-understand work.<br />Further, the science of understanding how gems transmit and reflect planetary rays and the knowledge of what gems can affect what planets and, as a result, your health, is a vital part of this hallmark book. And, speaking to the future, Mr. Beckman writes, \\"...the marriage of the further-advanced science of electronics with the sciences of light, color and gem therapy has allowed a much larger quantity of people the world over to take advantage of this most effective form of healing\\".<br />Vibrational Healing With Gems opened this reviewer's mind to a new (and ancient) means of healing...one that can play an important part in your life, and your children's!	2001-10-25

This reviewer can tell you from personal experience about the pain of losing a child. So can author, psychologist and mom, Dr. Vikki Ashley. And she can also tell you (and does) of raising a son who happened to be gay in a time when acceptance in our society was nil. And if that's not enough...Alan's Song of Love also relates the author's life as an abused wife, the subsequent (and necessary) divorce...and her life as a single, working mom.<br />Most of all, though, Alan's Song of Love is a true story about love, both Alan's and his mom's. Dr. Ashley tells of a fellow human being whose life was struck down far too early. Further, she tells of a mom who had to change the system, from the way the hospital treated AIDS patients...to the way physicians and other parents viewed them as well.<br />This page-turner offers the reader an opportunity to step into a different world, a place where crisis roller coasters to despair, anger, frustration...and back up to love, hope and the realization of self-reliance. Dr. Ashley writes, \\"Alan had no qualms about death, nor did I, finally.\\" And, \\"Anything wrong, Al? No, mom. Nothing's wrong. It's just that nothing's right!\\" <br />On January 22, 1988 Alan's pain and anxiety were ended...he succumbed to his illness. And the same strength of character...the same love...and the same self-reliance Vikki Ashley brought to bear to help her son...enabled her to survive his death. Alan's Song of Love is a wonderful love story, as well as evidence of Spirit, and the resultant strength and courage!	2001-10-25

'Til Death Do Us Part raises the interesting questions of how long a marriage should last, and, must it be a lifetime? Author, business executive and entrepreneur Rene Reid Yarnell explores these questions and her answers in this can't-put-it-down story of her own personal experiences, and her need to find the truth.<br />Here is a book that has it all...interesting characters (she's a former Roman Catholic Nun  who always believed in the \\"marriage is forever\\" credo, and he's a successful businessman)  who entered into a successful marriage/business partnership; lots of money and all the amenities that money could buy.<br />'Til Death Do Us Part is not so much about what went wrong...but that it was okay that the marriage did not  last forever. Ms Yarnell's message to the reader is about dealing with a breakup and understanding that it not necessarily an end, but a beginning.<br />Beginning? Yes, by taking the focus off blame and guilt, and placing it instead on appreciation for the love once shared. 'Til Death Do Us Part teaches us to take this experience and the resultant growth into the next chapter of our lives. \\"When a relationship ends, it is easy to fall into reaction mode. More than ever, this is a time to stay rooted in ourselves and not react to our partner's behavior\\".<br />'Til Death Do Us Part offers a means to reduce the sadness we feel at the end of a relationship, when we are forced to face a new beginning.

Dr. Beth Ley is a nutritionist, scientist, scholar, writer and publisher. She has studied and continues to study the natural substances in our bodies which promote immunity from disease and dysfunction and therefore, a more fulfilling and healthier life.<br />Her newest book, Immune System Control, focuses on colostrum, a vital immunity factor found in the early breast milk of humans and other mammals...and lactoferrin, also found in mother's milk as well as saliva, tears, nasal secretions and intestinal fluids. Both are linked to our immune system and affect every aspect of our lives.<br />Colostrum and lactoferrin can both be taken in oral lozenge form. Many pathogens can be stopped before they can enter our lungs, blood and intestines, by enhancing the immunity of the oral cavity and lymphatic system through stimulation by oral immune factors found in colostrum. <br />Dr. Ley offers evidence that these powerful immune regulators can help fight many common health problems, such as colds/flu, diarrhea, asthma/allergies, cancer, diabetes, gum disease, HIV, MS, GI problems...just to name a few. And so Immune System Control is a guide to better health through improved life-style, diet, balance and a keen understanding and appreciation of our natural immune system.<br />More...Dr. Ley has written Immune System Control in language easily understood; and in a style that allows the reader to reach logical conclusions. She has, in other words, translated complex scientific studies into a handbook that is as helpful as is clear.<br />This reviewer's eyes were opened by Immune System Control.

In order to appreciate the great wisdom to be found in Finding Enlightenment, you must first know the credentials of this wonderful biographer. J. Gordon Melton is the director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion, the author of over 25 books, encyclopedias  and almanacs, and an ordained elder in the United Methodist Church.<br />Further, this unbiased scholar studied the teachings of Ramtha as well as forming a kinship with JZ Knight. It is from this place he wrote his biography of JZ Knight and Ramtha and the lessons to be learned from both. These insights enabled seemingly ordinary citizen JZ Knight to discover the One living inside her...and the means to uncover the hidden realities. This is the wisdom and knowledge now available to us, today!<br />The foundation of Ramtha's teachings is Gnosticism...a belief that humans are angelic, perhaps even divine beings who are lost in a world of distractions, self-imposed limitations and confining traditions. We learn that Ramtha is a Lemurian who lived on Earth 35,000 years ago. His experiences and his desire to become the wind, and his ascension ultimately led him to God status. He is now back on Earth to teach us all he has learned...and JZ Knight with Ramtha's School of Enlightenment is his pulpit.<br />Finding Enlightenment offers a path as well as a comparison to the many religions abounding today. A major difference? Ramtha teaches that there is no Satan. This basic difference allows his students to focus on self-discovery and self-growth...and not fear.<br />This reviewer discovered in Finding Enlightenment a clear and unbiased view of Ramtha's teachings through his channel, JZ Knight. Thank you, J. Gordon Melton, for giving us insight into a woman shaman and an understanding of Ramtha's word!	2001-10-25

The award-winning author of The Humanure Handbook and The Slate Roof Bible, Joseph Jenkins, has another provocative and well-written book to grab (and hold) your attention: Balance Point, Searching for a Spiritual Link<br />In this novelized book of truths, protagonist Joe Jenkins is sent on an incredible mission by his deceased Great Aunt Lucy's baffling will...an eye-opener of a voyage toward the understanding of an imminent disaster of global proportions. Joe's journey is initiated at a wicca ceremony in a sweat lodge where he is pointed to his first destination, Newfoundland.<br />\\"We're robbing the earth's resources, particularly the non-renewable ones\\", Joe learned at a meeting with Sir (Professor) Gaulton of St. Johns College.  \\"...we've become so blinded by our robbing frenzy mentality, a behavior that we've learned to take completely for granted, that we've lost touch with the natural balance of the earth\\".<br />The quest to learn how to evolve the human psyche takes Joe (and his wife) on a reluctant itinerary to many remote places in both North and South America including the jungles of the Amazon. The message Joe learned is about the balance between careless selfishness in the use of natural resources, and our interaction and interdependence with each other and all of the natural world...a message of survival as well as one of spiritual awakening. As Great Aunt Lucy put it, \\"The forces of the Ego and Eco have become locked in combat\\".<br />Balance Point is a timely page-turner that speaks to the most important and immediate problem we face...saving our planet and ourselves.

Kemp's latest book, 7 Laws of Highest Prosperity, is a resounding yes!<br />Mr. Kemp has interwoven a fable with simple truths to create a tapestry of insight that can enable the reader to understand the co-existence of both monetary and spiritual values. 7 Laws of Highest Prosperity is the story of Sam the Wood Gatherer who finds better ways of doing business, increasing his profits from the same labor, contributing to his community's well-being and becoming a guidepost on the road called inspiration.<br />The 7 laws represented in this well-written and valuable lesson to transformation are amazingly obvious, yet many of us are simply too busy to recognize them. They start with the Law of Wisdom---\\"The highest wisdom resides in God's supreme thought and love.\\" All the other laws follow once we understand this truism.<br />The Laws of Priority, Motive, Generosity, Understanding, Preparation and Preservation describe the successes that can occur for us, our families, our communities and our future<BR>generations. Author and seeker knows from first hand experience. The lessons he learned while being a successful CPA, Chief Financial Officer, entrepreneur and co-owner (with Patty, his wife of 30 years) of investment services companies, are applied to this fine book.

Dance as a Healing Art exposes the viability of movement as a\\"...vehicle for releasing feelings which are essential to the healing process. Repressed or incongruent emotions shut down the immune system, causing pain and illness\\" relates Dr. Halprin.<br />Dance as a Healing Art, by definition, is an effective guide to healing for both teacher as well as student. It is filled with lessons to facilitate understanding of getting in touch with yourself (or patient) both physically as well as emotionally and spiritually.  <br />Anna Halprin re-defines ritual to refer \\"...to an artistic process by which people gather and unify themselves in order to confront the challenges of their existence\\". That, in turn, defines Dance as a Healing Art as a process that enables the person in a health crisis to reach within and apply their emotional and spiritual healing tools to help.<br />Dance as a Healing Art is a powerful book from a pioneer and innovator.

It was in 1977 that JZ Knight had her first encounter with an extraordinary being...Ramtha, an amorphic entity and higher power from Lemuria and a participant in the pilgrimage to Atlantis. Ramtha selected JZ Knight as the channel rather than appear in physical form and risk being deified...and to declare that God is both man and woman, yet neither.<br />A Beginner's Guide to Creating Reality leads the reader into the metaphysical world of Ramtha, and to a set of truths (not a religion) that can change your life, forever. While autobiographical in makeup, here is a book that not only introduces an entity of wisdom, it introduces the wisdom itself and the fundamental concepts of Ramtha's teachings.<br />The reader will discover, as this reviewer did, what true consciousness is and who we were, are and can be, starting with the Void. Ramtha says, \\"This (the Void) is the Mother/Father Principle that gave it life, and this is where you started.\\" We learn that God is in all of us, and always has been. Here is a another doorway to enlightenment, \\"If you are Gods--and you most certainly are--and if consciousness and energy create the nature of reality, perhaps the problem that we have here is the inability to believe in oneself of its capability.\\" <br />And so, an accurate description of A Beginner's Guide to Creating Reality has to be that it is a mass of information and logic that offers guidance and a philosophy to attain that manifestation of acceptance. Ramtha says, \\"O my beloved God,/ I do decree/ that that which I focus upon/ I surely want./ Manifest it straightaway./So be it./ To life.\\"	2001-10-25

Ekanta (the protagonist in this fine book) was born into a time when the old ways of life were being displaced by the advancement of the technical age. This threatened to destroy the timeless tenets which had fostered and maintained harmony for so many centuries. Ekanta was born to be a free soul who is beyond dualities though still abiding in human form as an example for others. Ekanta is an Avadhut.<br />The Avadhut is about the vital lessons Ekanta learned that added immensely to his understanding of The Universal Form and how It expresses Its infinite, indivisible and formless Essence during extended periods of manifestation. And it may be that Babaji Bob Kindler is the only person on Earth who could set down these 700 pages in such an orderly and understandable format, and have the vast religious training to write it so well.<br />Ekanta learned many lessons; forbearance from  Earth...the patient and selfless desire to help others; Peace from the Maiden...the sense of tranquility knowing only One reigns supreme; equanimity from the Ocean...a sense of balance and poise in the face of trials and imperfections as well as  happiness and bliss; and transcendence from the Sky...the awareness to rise above all dualities to be peaceful and content.<br />Additionally, The Avadhut teaches us (as Ekanta was taught) so much more...from freedom, grace, purity and unity to heedfulness, detachment, contentedness and moderation. Here is a way of life that can strip you bare of the unnecessary and fill you up with the reality of true spiritual presence.<br />Babaji Bob Kindler was initiated into  the Ramakrishna Order by Swami Aseshananda, a direct disciple of Sri Sarada Devi, wife of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa; is founder of the SRV Independent Associations as well as teacher, musician and extremely prolific<BR>and powerful writer.<br />The Avadhut, in this reviewer's opinion, is the means to find a better way of life, a life we were meant to lead, but lost our way. This is abook to embrace, devour and let its wisdom nourish you to enlightenment!	2001-10-25

What happens when you combine the studies of psychology and shamanism? Are the two practices divergent...or are there some commonalties? Author, teacher, licensed psychologist and student of shamanism Jeannette Gagan answers with a resounding \\"yes\\" in her brilliant book, Journeying.<br />Dr. Gagan has crafted her book to lead the reader, in a logical order and with easy-to-understand language, through the nature and history of both fields. Then we learn some of the approaches of understanding and healing.<br />In chapters 3 and 4, Journeying gets down to it...the place where shamanism and psychology intersect, the mending of emotional wounding. Inadequate bonding, neglect, abuse, aggression, anger and violence are some of the conditions we learn about, and the healing brought to bear.<br />In the final pages, Journeying offers the bridge that brings shamanism and psychology together...that reflects the bond between the alchemy of shamanic healing and the science of psychology. \\"Shamanic cultures, I found, understand the debilitating effects of trauma and strive to restore wholeness to distressed individuals\\" writes Dr. Gagan. And, after all, isn't that a prime purpose of psychology, too?<br />This reviewer is no psychologist nor shaman, but can see and feel the logic and rightness of grand ideas when expressed in a well-written book. Indicative of that is, \\"Shamans search for lost pieces of soul and return them to members of their community. Psychologists investigate the workings of the mind and strive to validate their methodological approaches. Shamanism has soul to give to psychology. Psychology has science to give to shamanism\\".<br />Journeying has insight, love, learning and practical experience to give us. Thank you, Jeannette Gagan, for making the connection!	2001-10-25

We certainly all agree that love is the glue that binds us together to accept ourselves, our mates, our neighbors...indeed all others. In his new and dynamic book, The Logic of Love,  Halbert Katzen demonstrates how faith in God can be a logical extension of love.<br />Mr. Katzen deftly leads the reader through an understanding of what love means, \\"...the desire and willingness to do well for others.\\" It is self-empowering and the highest value in our lives. \\"If love is the supreme value, and if we are to know by our experience that love is real in our lives, then experiences with God must be in proportion to the quality of faith-activated love that we  demonstrate in our lives\\", writes Mr. Katzen.<br />But what about freewill? \\"Though a proof of God based on  logic would undermine freewill, personal experience of God through faith does not necessarily undermine freewill or our ability to know that our love is real\\". Halbert Katzen concludes, therefore, \\"By the force of freewill, faith forms the foundation of our relationship to each other and holds the hope of experiencing the love of God\\".<br />The Logic of Love is, this reviewer believes, a path to faith for the thinking person. Mr. Katzen presents a foundation of understanding that faith in God is not only a reasonable choice, but a logical outgrowth of love.<BR>  <BR>This reviewer recommends The Logic of Love to anyone without faith in God, or anyone who is uncertain. Halbert Katzen has given us a bright light that illuminates the path to spirituality through love...in a thoughtful and provocative way!	2001-10-25

When London was only a village, the Mayan civilization inhabited ancient Mexico. Indeed, the cities of Tikal and Teotihuacan each had at least 100,000 citizens. This culture, steeped in spiritualism and science, as well as artistic beauty and advanced engineering techniques, offers much to our understanding of Spirit consciousness.<br />The subject of Carl Johan Calleman's far-reaching new book, The Mayan Calendar, is the legacy of the Mayans and a means for people to discern true purpose in life through a wider perspective of the world that it fosters. Thus, The Mayan Calendar lends a detailed description of human history...it's science, religions, growth, beliefs...and predictions for our future. Dr. Calleman writes, \\"We may thus also say that the Mayan calendar will provide guidance for the future and an improved understanding of the course of events as they unfold\\".<br />This reviewer found in The Mayan Calendar a well-written and researched discussion of evolution, and our place in the cosmos. Dr. Calleman unites Eastern and Western philosophies...and science and religion, at the same time. The author is uniquely qualified for this task since he holds a Doctorate in Physical Biology, and has been a student of the Mayan calendar for over eight years.<br />Further, this powerful work can enable us to discover the higher purpose meant for us, and how to fulfill it. Carl Johan Calleman has given us a book of insight and hope. The Mayan Calendar, in this reviewer's opinion, should be read by everyone seeking wholeness...everyone!	2001-10-25

Peter Cairn and Patrick Kennedy are two friends just ambling through a meaningless and superficial life. Patrick, though, realizes that he is merely treading water and responds to an ad in the newspaper offering help to redeem one's warrior passion. What they learn is the subject of an intriguing and provocative book that kept this reviewer riveted.<br />The Power of the Gift, by internationally acclaimed lecturer,  workshop leader and author Christopher Moon leads the reader to an understanding of what we are (and why)...and what we can be! This path to growth and wholeness is illuminated by truths that resonate now, and will, forever.<br />True Warriors know that they are the priority...that taking responsibility leads to the greater awareness that Warriors never procrastinate because procrastination causes mental clutter that keeps you thinking about what you have to do, not what you really want to do.<br />Further, we learn that true Warriors never sacrifice, for whatever we sacrifice to  becomes more important than self. And to be a Warrior, we must learn accountability and personal responsibility.<br />The beauty of The Power of the Gift is two-fold. First, the lessons taught are the lessons of the true meaning of life, growth, success and wholeness. Second, Christopher Moon has written The Power of the Gift not in a preachy or larger than life way, but in a down to earth fashion. Sometimes light and sometimes deep, but always powerful.<br />This reviewer strongly recommends that you follow the lessons learned by Cairn and Kennedy. You'll discover that The Power of the Gift is talking to you, too!	2001-10-25

Thomas DuGan travels the byroads of the world and life, never settling in one place but always absorbing what he sees, hears and feels. Abstract Thought &amp; Profound Quotations expresses the knowledge he has garnered and becomes a perfect vehicle for the reader to ride while searching for truth.<br />The forty-seven profound quotations; thirty-four insightful thoughts; and various and sundry stories and illustrations are nuggets of wisdom that provoke thought. And, in this reviewer's opinion, a great book is one that gets the reader to think.<br />For instance, \\"If one has much money, one may get crazy; if one has little money, one may entertain thoughts of some relief; if one has no money, one has nothing to think about\\". And, \\"Governments are very much like soap operas. Like TV, turn the government off, then four or five months later turn government on and one will find that, speaking generally nothing has changed.\\"<br />Thomas DuGan does not offer answers or solutions. Instead, he looks at a situation and offers a perception.The reader must then think about it, and at the same time, gain an understanding of their thought processes. His perceptions are always thoughtful, sometimes humorous, and occasionally wry, and are a credit to Mr. DuGan's writing skills and humanity.<br />Abstract Thought &amp; Profound Quotations is the ticket for a journey to enlightenment. The ride transports the reader to eye-opening revelations that can be life-altering. Mr. DuGan writes, \\"Life becomes worth something when something good comes from it\\". In this reviewer's opinion, that describes Abstract Thought &amp; Profound Quotations.	2001-10-25

In the very beginning of his eye-opener book, Dr. Charles Meister tells us that there are two kinds of religion...the divisive and the unitive. Religion: Bane or Blessing leads the reader to an understanding of why there are religious wars and, indeed,  why people of a religion are attacking and even killing people of the same religion.<br />We read, \\"Most religions profess to be revelations of divine truth. Many times the revelation is alleged to be an exclusive one from God. This assists the faith in acquiring adherents but generally builds barriers against non-adherents\\". This is divisive. The purest form of religion unites humans to God, and humans to humans. In short, Love!<br />\\"The dichotomy is clear. One says, because I believe in God, I hate you. The other view is, because I believe in God, I love you\\". If we believe that God espouses love (and I believe that is the central tenet of all unitive religious thought) then any divisiveness must come from misinterpretation or arrogance.<br />Religion: Bane or Blessing takes the reader on an exploration of the history of early religions, religious doctrines and religious rituals. Dr. Meister methodically and factually tells us why we are what we are. His chapter, Bill of Spiritual Rights, suggests a doctrine based on human dignity--\\"The belief that every human being has a unique and sacred importance. Human dignity is based ultimately on the fact that all persons are God's children. Recognition of our basic importance to God should keep down human brutality, terrorism and war\\".<br />Charles Meister is a scholar, author, World War II battlefield hero and teacher. The wisdom he brings to Religion: Bane or Blessing can improve the lives of all people by bringing peace on earth. In this reviewer's opinion, this is a book to read, and then read again; and discuss and then discuss again!	2001-10-25

Author, counselor, scholar and seeker Ruth Mierswa says in the very beginning of her new book, \\"You came into this life for two reasons--one is to help people and the other is to change your weaknesses into strengths.\\" After reading the rest of Who You Are and Why You Are Here, this reviewer found a pathway to accomplish both.<br />Using the Seven Rays from the Alice Bailey series (but offering understanding in a clearer and more concise fashion) Ms. Mierswa brings all disciplines together while lifting them to a higher level...and she also shows how the reader can be lifted to a higher level, too.<br />Who You Are and Why You Are Here enables you to find your personality ray and soul ray which identifies, with copious details, your life purpose and personality type. It was intriguing for this reviewer that I, a Pisces, have a ray 1 soul and personality . I discovered much about myself, especially that my character weaknesses (and there are many) can be transmuted into strengths--and Ruth Mierswa told me how! And so it is for all signs.<br />So many people are hurting! They want to know, \\"Why me? Why did this happen to me?\\" <BR>This book explains why they have these experiences and how these experiences are opportunities for spiritual growth. You'll be shown how to rid yourself of anger, guilt, and other harmful emotions on both a conscious and unconscious level.<br />Ruth Mierswa has given us a book that answers many of your \\"why\\" questions e.g. why some people are born talented or with a superior intellect. Who You Are and Why You Are Here identifies your level of evolvement and gives you the means to evolve higher. In the doing, by changing weaknesses into strengths, you'll be better able to help humankind---and that's why we're here!	2001-10-25

Author and seeker Sidney Schwartz questioned the bible, and the roles of religious leaders, since his college years. His destiny of finding truth, began when meeting Carl Hewitt, a trance-medium. AWAN (Angel Without a Name), a highly evolved Spirit, spoke to the author using the entranced medium's vocal cords. Though a series of  unique conversations, AWAN provided ancient knowledge and truth.<br />Eventually AWAN appointed Sidney Schwartz to be his messenger proclaiming, \\"You are to write down my teachings in the form of books that will help people raise their consciousness.\\" The first of these books is My First Encounter with an Angel, the results of Dr. Hewitt's extraordinary mediumistic abilities, Sidney Schwartz's curiosity and scholarship, and AWANs astounding revelations.<br />AWAN's first revelation: \\"Religious leaders have altered the Bible for their own purposes,\\" inspired the author to research 160 versions of the bible. Much to the author's disbelief, he discovered AWAN was correct. A two word Hebrew phrase was translated 52 different ways in 107 Old Testaments! Mr. Schwartz asks: \\"If there is so much diversity in the translation of two words, how accurate can the translation of the other thousands of words from the original Hebrew text into English be?\\" <br />Another of  AWAN's revelations was that the bible is a book of psychic history. The events that theologians label as miracles were really demonstrations of psychic phenomena. What astounded the author was that many of the versions of the bible read<BR> almost identically, however, \\"... as soon as psychic phenomena was discussed, there is a sudden myriad of differences.\\" AWAN explained that since biblical times, priests were threatened by mediumship. The priest claimed to be the intermediary between God and the people, however, it was the prophet who had the psychic ability to conduct a two-way conversation with God (Spirit).<br />Sidney Schwartz has given us a mind-opening book. My First Encounterwith an Angel offers insight to a new, yet ancient, understanding of God's word. Here is a well-written book that can alter your perceptions, and change your attitudes!	2001-10-25

Imagination is the process of ideas, of creativity, and of fantasy. Suppose we could harness imagination for all thought and thus for reality? That is the subject of William Marts' new and exciting book, Imagintelligence.<br />Here we find an effective Imagery Management Plan that can \\"...change the belief system and our organic artificial intelligence programs in our emotional systems by improving the self-image; that is, coming to terms with the truth that you are a powerful, spiritual, divine being---a child of God\\". In other words, a means to deprogram your subconscious mind of the negative emotional impulses.<br />Imagintelligence is the first book this reviewer has seen that correlates imagination and emotion as being one within the body/mind connection. We learn that, \\"The emotional system is your body's artificial intelligence system\\". It is geared to survival and quick response and, thus runs ahead of willful, conscious thought. And so, William Marts teaches us how to ignore these first impulses which he calls emotional virtual reality, and instead think before you imagine!<br />Imagintelligence shows us how to eliminate fear from our responses, the source of bad decisions. We learn to identify our limiters and instead use the power of positive prayer. And how to use affirmations of our higher selves, our I AM selves, which is a vital antidote to anger, hate and insecurity.<br />Imagintelligence is a means to emotional literacy by elimination of the ignorance that inhibits self-realization. William Marts has given us a quantum leap to a new consciousness and an ability to act and react with intelligence!	2001-10-25

Daniel Clay sees himself as a lighthouse, illuminating for us the proper way. His immensely readable book, The Prophecies, are the visions he sees for us, our country, our planet and our world. The messages came to him while in a meditative state and offer scenarios if we listen...and if we do not!<br />The Prophecies addresses many vital subjects...from technology to health to finances to natural resources. Most of all, though, Daniel Clay speaks to the situations that affect everyone of us in a most personal way. Like child-raising, terrorism, peace and even politics. For instance,  he forecasts the end of communism everywhere; the oncoming prosperity of Asia; and the coming obsolescence of money, \\"Gold and silver will be without value, diamonds but decoration\\".<br />This reviewer found this quotation most interesting, \\"And that there will come into this global economic environment an individual of goodwill and piety. He shall be the Pope of the Holy Roman Catholic Church\\". Further, Pope Sixtus shall reform the church...and this man will bring peace until \\"...another spirit shall enter the body...the spirit of evil incarnate...and the end will be near\\".<br />Daniel Clay is a man of humility and integrity. His words should be heeded because he may be the spiritual teacher we've been expecting. The Prophecies is one of the most interesting and provocative books published. In this reviewer's opinion, Daniel Clay is a prophet of great magnitude and his words can lift our consciousness dramatically!	2001-10-25

This reviewer delights in learning, especially about people and cultures who can and did make an impact...and natural medicines that have their roots in a period thousands of years ago. So, when author Jaya Bear sent me her book, Amazon Magic, I discovered a wonderful opportunity and biography, as well as a narrative filled with mystery about a totally different reality.<BR> <BR>Don Agustin Rivas Vasquez (1933-) was born in Tamshiyacu, Peru, a small jungle town along the Amazon River. What is was to grow up in this totally different (from us) environment...learn to be a shaman...and acquire the skills to use healing plant medicines such as ayahuasca, are the subjects of this fascinating new book.<br />Amazon Magic enables the reader to walk in the shoes of a shaman and understand his experiences and adventures...and his training and discipline to achieve his widely-regarded status as a profound healer. This reviewer was fascinated by not only plant medicines, but the spirits that reside in the jungle. And how ayahuasca, for instance, can help one see the spirits, and the demons. \\"Each of us has our demons, and ayahuasca shows them to us so we can face them and heal. Ayahuasca teaches us truth about ourselves\\".<br />Author, world traveler, artist and student of many spiritual cultures, Jaya Bear, felt drawn to travel to Peru after her husband died. She met Don Agustin Rivas Vasquez, and has continued to work closely with him since that time.<br />The result is Amazon Magic, a fascinating look at a culture and individual that have made an impact. Jaya Bear presents this revelation in an easily- read- and- understood fashion that captures Don Agustin's words, love and compassion!	2001-10-25

What was it like to discard the old ways of the Hebrews and adopt a whole new way of thinking, the way of Jesus Christ? And what was it like to do this in a community conquered by the Romans...where you were, at the very least, the spiritual enemy?<br />Secrets of Revelation is about John, the Beloved who understood, and lived the seven steps (churches) of spiritual ascension. Author and life-long student of metaphysics Arthur  Ingalls reveals the commitments to moral and spiritual principles that John learned, and how we can attain the same glory and purpose.<br />Dr. Ingalls writes, \\"The seven churches represent seven power centers, each power center correlates to man's purpose in the universe as well as on earth...Each power center (chakra) matched a certain trait [and] theses traits had to be recognized and purified\\". <br />Secrets of Revelation leads the reader (as John discovered so long ago) to the understanding that, \\"Each of us has a special mission from God. That mission promotes God's peace and love in the universe\\". Thus, we learn, the material world is the essence of imprisonment, while freedom is accepting Spirit as life.<br />The journey of John, the Beloved is a journey to discovery, that \\"The temple of God is within\\". Dr Ingalls has written a biographical sketch about a man who learned to absorb the meaning of each chakra and practice the principles described. Secrets of Revelation shows us how to emulate John and thereby lead a life of service. This is a great book!	2001-10-25

Cancer kills and maims and, truth be known, the current, \\"accepted\\"  reatments---chemo and radiation--- haven't done much for  survival. <br />The Cancer Handbook: What's Really Working  discusses the possible causes of cancer: family history, contraceptives, environment, drugs, stress and nutrition. We then learn about the current detection methods.  Ms. McTaggart offers us enlightenment in today's conventional treatments--- chemo, radiation, light therapy, immunotherapy and, of course, surgery...all of which have had extremely limited success in offering a cure.<br />The vital point that The Cancer Handbook makes is that there are alternative cancer treatments available to us IF the orthodox medical community would be willing to try them. \\"Despite this climate of suppression, a number of alternative treatments have been the subject of some properly designed laboratory and clinical research. Although all would benefit from further study, they certainly appear more promising than most of the tools of orthodox medicine\\".<br />Doesn't it make sense to strengthen our own immunity and  therefore our ability to destroy cancer cells, instead of using invasive chemo, radiation and surgery? How this can be accomplished is detailed in The Cancer Handbook. This eye-opener offers valuable, indeed lifesaving information about therapies like immuno-augmentative, peptide, Govallo, Gerson, Coley's, Kelley's, and macrobiotics, as well as diet and  upplements.<br />This reviewer has lost both parents and a daughter to the scourge called cancer.

Thus begins one of the most insightful, integral and wisdom-filled books this reviewer has seen in a long time.<br />The Next Step in Evolution was completed while the author was on a personal retreat in the desert resulting in his most spiritually satisfying experience, ever. The words channeled come from beings who came from God. The words are a simple message for your soul that can encourage, strengthen and enhance your understanding of reality. Mr. Cole writes, \\"The journey begins by looking inward...to glimpse even a small fraction of God will bring understanding of your own true nature\\".<br />The Next Step in Evolution offers more than a glimpse, though. Vincent Cole leads the reader to an understanding of who we are, who we can be, and how. He takes us, for instance, beyond ego to unity with Spirit. He takes us from, \\"I am a man, woman, democrat, republican etc. to I AM...and the reality of true self and true personality.<br />Mr. Cole takes us through and past the conflict between our ego-based fears and the power of Spirit, thereby enabling us to heed a new master. The result is totally wonderful, \\"...to grow into the person God created you to be: a child of light and love\\". This responsibility gives us strength, wisdom, knowledge and so much more. <br />The Next Step in Evolution is a doorway to enlightenment. And love, compassion, trust, peace and forgiveness.

In his new book, Qabalah, Daniel Feldman has made available for the first time a comprehensive record of the closed-door teachings of the Work of the Chariot Trust. In this landmark volume, Mr. Feldman initially examines all the mystical branches that emanated from Abraham and his children, and pursues some fundamental, if not controversial, questions. How was the religion of the ancient Hebrews different from Rabbinical Judaism? How are the Mystical Qabalah, Mystical Christianity, and Sufism related? How is the Mystical Qabalah different from the Religious and Magical Qabalah? Is it possible that the children of Abraham's concubines founded the Tanric tradition of northern India?<br />Qabalah answers these questions, and delineates many other connections between the Mystical Qabalah and all of the world's primary mystical traditions. Indeed, Mr. Feldman has produced and illustrated a totally comprehensive and comparative study of the Mystical Qabalah unlike anything this reviewer has ever seen. Dozens of the qabalistic diagrams in this book are not to be found in any other book on the subject. The treatment of the Tree of Life is unparalleled! Mr. Feldman gives the reader a thorough foundation on qabalistic meditation practices and then provides clear instructions on how to perform these practices in a manner that anyone can follow.<br />There are dozens of books on the Qabalah. Many of them leave you even more confused after you read them, and provide little information on what practices to engage in. So, if you've been searching for a single book that gives you the complete and genuine teachings of the Mystical Qabalah, plus meditation practices that you can understand and apply right away, look no further. Qabalah is the book you have been waiting for!	2001-10-25

This reviewer read and endorsed Dr. Menahem's first book, When Therapy Isn't Enough. The publication of his second, All Your Prayers Are Answered, proves two truths to me. One is that education and the resultant enlightenment is ongoing. And the other is that Sam Menahem is even more insightful, compassionate and sharing than I knew.<br />All Your Prayers Are Answered continues and amplifies the fact that, \\"...in addition to the personal unconscious self, with all its conflicts, there is also a Higher Spiritual Self...\\". Thus, Dr. Menahem explores the ways in which prayer and meditation work, how to pray effectively and how to recognize the answers to our prayers.<br />The reader learns that, \\"When people seek therapy, they are usually looking for symptomatic relief from depression, anxiety, guilt or relationship problems\\". But as Dr. Menahem points out, \\"As we learn to join with the Higher Self, the part of us connected to the divine, our symptoms fade and our relationships improve\\".<br />By using his studies in Eastern and Western religions combined with his training in transpersonal psychology and actual case studies of patients he has treated, Dr. Menahem proves the effectiveness of the alliance between ego and Spirit. \\"It is very difficult to get the ego to acknowledge its inevitable alliance with God.

From the author of Ashes for the Elephant God comes a novel that speaks from the heart about relationships, angels, aliens and seduction. Vijaya Schartz offers a page-turner entitled Archangel Crusader that kept this reviewer riveted.<br />The protagonist, Michael Tanner (tall, good looking and muscular) is a brawler and boozer who uses fighting and alcohol to cope with his feelings of inadequacy and his various failed relationships. He meets a Blue Angel who claims to be his father...but Michael sees this as one more hallucination. However, his girlfriend then disappears, his daughter is threatened, and Michael finds reality in the alien threatening her, and Earth.<br />Vijaya Schartz skillfully weaves new age thought, science fiction, fantasy and even Satanism into a novel about good versus evil, and failure versus enlightenment. Archangel Crusader propels the reader to among other places, Philadelphia, Paris, Washington DC and yes, outer space.<br />This reviewer discovered, in Archangel Crusader, a book written on at least two levels...the mark of a good book. Surely we have a compelling fantasy novel that will take charge of your life so that you won't want to put it down, And, we find a book of truths that illuminate the paths of good and evil...and the destiny each affords. <br />In the final analysis, Vijaya Schartz has given us a book about redemption and healing. In this reviewer's opinion, Archangel  rusader is a superior novel that enthralls and, at the same time, awakens!	2001-10-25

Children's books are often amusing, sometimes convey an integral message and only occasionally speak to the heart. Until now! Author and RN Elissa Al-Chokhachy gives us The Angel with the Golden Glow, which accomplishes all three, beautifully.<br />The angel is sent to earth in the body of a newborn destined to live for a short time. God tells him, \\"Your light is so bright it can penetrate even the deepest sadness and change it into love. It is you, blessed angel, who shall do My work on earth.\\" <br />If this sounds like a parable of the greatest gift of love ever, it is. The angel leaves his fellow angels and friends to share his love as the newborn son. Whenever there is sadness, he shines his brightness and brings comfort. Once the angel's work on earth is completed, he returns to heaven to his friends, feeling fulfilled. His message of love is transformative and profound.<br />Then his best friend, The Angel with the Tender Heart, is sent by God to be born into the same family. \\"There is still much healing that needs to be done. Just think! We will be earthly brothers as well as heavenly brothers. This is surely the greatest honor of my life.\\"<br />As a hospice nurse, Ms. Al-Chokhachy cared for a fourteen month old baby boy with a terminal neurological disorder. She worked sixty hours a week for four months tending this special baby and observed how he radiated intense unconditional love. Her true experience is the basis of The Angel with the Golden Glow and also inspired her marvelous CD: A Parent's Lullaby.<br />The inspirational words author Elissa Al-Chokhachy  wrote are complemented by the beautiful illustrations by German artist Ulrike Graf. Together, they have given us a breakthrough in children's books. This reviewer recommends that The Angel with the Golden Glow be read by adults, as well as children. It is a gift of love!	2001-10-25

In his autobiographical page-turner, Elements of Creation, Author and seeker Bruce Luther offers a tale of discovery that kept this reviewer revitted. That discovery occurred in India...and it forever changed his life.<br />Bruce Luther found the circle of life, the body in time. He writes, \\"The body is a vehicle for an awareness in which to experience reality. The body shifts space and time and moves it so that the awareness has a vehicle in which to see materiality. Just like the water passing by the hull of the boat, as one we pass through this awareness, the contact we make with reality has a startling impact on our direction.\\"<br />Elements of Creation takes the reader, as it did the author, in and out of time cycles...sometimes into the past, and sometimes into the future. They can reveal \\"...every experience we have had and those yet to come.\\" Like watching a motion picture, awareness of choices unreel exposing selections \\"...made from our core being, before we take a body.\\" And so we learn that the circle of life is not life and death, but a test of our ability to remember our way.\\"<br />Bruce Luther is a seer and painter. Elements of Creation is his canvas and the reader finds his words are bright splashes of color representing images he's seen since childhood. His journey into the circle dance unveiled the validation of his direction. Elements of Creation  will hold you, shock you, awaken you and rid you of the beast that blocks your way to attainment!	2001-10-25

This reviewer has been privileged to meet a very interesting man who has authored a very interesting book. Vincent J. Leardi is a teacher, a graduate of West Point (BS in Engineering), and holds a Masters in Business Administration from Boston College.<br />His new book, The Universal Collective Unconscious and the Metaphysical Utopia reflects his love of philosophy and metaphysics and serves as proof of the concepts you will find in this provocative work. The basis is that all thoughts and ideas both pre-exist and exist simultaneously i.e. thoughts and the physical are both realities. And that means there is one universal mind---and that we are all God!<br />\\"This Universal Collective Unconsciousness (U.C.U.) is every idea, entity and event that ever was and always will be. It (U.C.U) evolves and devolves, changes form and enacts the illusion of change.\\", we learn in this insightful work that combines Eastern and Western philosophies with advanced physics. The result for this reviewer (and you, too) is mind expansion in the short term.<br />The long term effect can be the elimination of perceived differences between people; and the enhancement of similarities. This leads to interconnectedness which leads to agreement which leads to peace. And by our understanding that we are all a part of God and not separate or different, we eliminate fear of God, and each other.<br />The Universal Collective Unconsciousness...shines like a beacon illuminating a goal of harmony and unity of humankind. Vincent J. Leardi has given us the tools to escape to reality, not from reality. Indeed, this book is a guide to a metaphysical utopia!	2001-10-25

Gary was sixteen when he was diagnosed with leukemia. His  oncologist recommended immediate chemotherapy, and the monitoring of Gary's reaction to the medication.<br />Gary's Wish List tells the story of Gary's remaining time on this earth. His mother, author and educator Mary Louise Selph deftly discusses all the ramifications of learning of her son's diagnosis. The guilt, the sadness, the feelings of defeat and desperation, the shock, confusion and inadequacy. And the anger and loss of faith.<br />Gary's words, in letters he wrote to friends and family, along with conversations with his immediate family shine a light of understanding and courage in the face of such a huge disaster. We learn how Gary finds the means to still be a teenager...and their reaction when the chemo wasn't working.<br />Pneumonia, weight loss, hair loss and weakness follow as well as a near-death experience from the chemo that was designed to strengthen Gary for a bone marrow transplant. During the brush with death Gary had an out-of-body experience that enabled him to relate everything that happened even though he was unconscious! All that was followed by the transplant, and protective isolation and radiation.<br />The treatment helped, but only for a while. Gary succumbed after nine months of a valiant fight. His funeral was held on what would have been his first day as a high school senior.<br />Gary's legacy is courage and the sacredness of life. Gary's Wish List is another. Mary Louise Selph has found the courage to write a page-turner of a book that enables the reader to walk in her shoes, and Gary's, too. In this reviewer's opinion, Gary's Wish List is a means to find peace through understanding!	2001-10-25

To be a mentor we learn in Mary Doyle's great new book, is to be a teacher, guide, example, encourager, facilitator and enabler. Mentoring Heroes offers the stories of 52 successful women and the mentors who empowered them. Thus, this book is a revelation of leaders inspiring others to become leaders to make their lives and their world better.<br />Here are the stories of but a few very successful women and how they rose to the top with the assistance and selflessness of their mentors. Ms. Doyle is very quick to point out that often the mentor was male, and often the mentoring was facilitated to no small degree by Divine Guidance.<br />Several of the success stories involve women this reviewer (and perhaps you, too) are aware of---for instance, actress, singer and motivational speaker Ann Jillian; Senior Marketing Vice resident of Sales Operations for BP Amoco Petroleum Products Anna<BR>Cheng Catalano; archeologist with New York Metropolitan Museum of Art Diana Craig Patch, Ph.D. and Barbara Junceau, professional astrologer for personal and spiritual counseling.<br />On the other hand, most of these fabulous women are quietly leading their successful lives, each in their own venues and each very real. How did they do it? How did they make the time? How did they put their mentor's advice to work? And how have they become mentors in their own right? This reviewer exhorts you to read the book!<br />To be a mentor is to give of oneself to assist in the development of others. The reader will quickly ascertain that a prime example of such nobility is author Mary K. Doyle, herself. By writing and publishing Mentoring Heroes, Mary has opened a door for all of us. It is no wonder that this book won the Certificate of Excellence, National Publisher's Freedom Award, 2000. Mentoring Heroes is an inspiration!	2001-09-10

Author, speaker and Master Certified Coach Marcia Reynolds asked herself the question, \\"How much of my life was I living on automatic pilot?\\". That's a door-opening question we must all ask ourselves, and the answer is found in her new, award-winning self-help book, Capture the Rapture. Indeed, if you are not leading a passionate, joyful life, this book is a must-read!<BR>The beginning of Capture the Rapture asks the reader to self-examine life. Are we doing things i.e. keeping busy but not feeling satisfied---living in a horizontal world, moving from one activity to another? Or is our world vertical---using our senses to appreciate all that is around us---the sights and smells and touch of mountains and rivers; roses and lilacs; the softness of a partner. Marcia, using her own personal experiences (she lifted herself out of a world of drugs, jail and a total lack of self-esteem) and her education and experience (two masters degrees and two decades of successful corporate work) guides the reader to self-discovery, empowerment and thus joy and happiness. Her first step is visioning---a three-dimensional picture of our desires---a virtual reality- program of our own design!<BR>The second step is covisioning---to include other people around you, bringing visioning to fruition, and then \\"...the commitment to your vision and a disciplined approach to its attainment.\\" Step by step, page by page, Capture the Rapture leads the reader out of the past and even out of the present---to envision a future of fulfillment. Thus Marcia Reynolds has given us much more than a self-help book. She has given us the means to liberation.<BR>In this reviewer's opinion, Capture the Rapture is a well-written, heart-felt path to passion and purpose!	2001-09-10

Whether the addiction is to alcohol, drugs, an eating disorder or obsessive/compulsive behavior, addiction takes its toll on our freedom, self-confidence, and self-reliance. Until recently, the best treatment has been the A.A. 12-step program.<BR>Psychotherapist Tina Tessina improved on that program with the publication of The Real 13th Step ten years ago. Now, her revised edition amplifies the latest research on addiction and helps people in recovery beyond what is not covered in the A.A. program. You see, while the Alcoholics Anonymous program has done a tremendous amount of good to help people free themselves from addiction, in doing so it teaches its membership that they are one drink away from total relapse. This can undermine one's self-esteem, inhibit outside activity and perhaps create an addiction to the program.<BR>The Real 13th Step shows us the means to growth beyond recovery \\"...that transcends any permanent dependency on the program to  keep them free from addiction.\\" Certainly Dr. Tessina holds the A.A. program in high esteem, but at the same time, shows the reader that there is life beyond the group and beyond recovery. And that life includes growth, accomplishment and achievement. Through the step-by-step, therapy-tested exercises and guidelines in her book, Dr. Tina Tessina opens the door to autonomy and lasting recovery from patterns of dependency. In this reviewer's opinion, The Real 13th Step is a must-read for an anyone in an addiction program---or anyone seeking assertiveness; lacking self-confidence; or fearful of confrontation!	2001-09-10

Divorce can be devastating, and divorce involving children can be worse. In K.C.'s new, enlightening and (often) politically incorrect book, Where's Daddy?, the reader looks at some inhumane divorce practices that adversely affect the lives of the children, parents, grandparents, friends---and everyone else.<br />It is an unfortunate fact that 50% of marriages end in divorce, and 43% of the children are left with one parent. \\"Why is this?\\" asks author and cultural anthropologist K.C., a nom-de-plume for a self-described common man. The answer seems to stem from our Northern European ancestry and our system of custody-access-support. In other words, its about our culture.<br />The author makes the case that while the husband-wife partnership may breakdown, the revised family structure that eliminates one parent (usually the father) should not. Where's Daddy? tells us that \\"...90% of homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes; 80% of rapists motivated by displaced anger come from fatherless homes; 71% of pregnant teenagers lack a father; and 63%of youth suicides are from fatherless homes.\\"<br />Where's Daddy? challenges the argument that women make better parents than men---and that's only the beginning of the author's controversial theses. We read, \\"If we want our parents to live up  to the real sacred obligation to the children, free them to do so as best as they can. Each equally...we must stop turning divorcing a spouse into divorcing the children\\".<br />Eye-opening. Provocative. Argumentative...all these words describe Where's Daddy? And the words to describe author K.C. must be honest, heart-felt and knowledgeable.
