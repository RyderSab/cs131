Like most homebrewers, I started out with Charlie Papazian's book \\"The New Joy of Homebrewing\\".  I had the second edition.  It was a good book, but comparing it to this text, it seems hopelessly dated.   <br /> <br />With the explosion of microbreweries across the country, lots of people got turned on to GOOD beer - and many of those looked into homebrewing.  With so many people trying different methods and equipment, over time, brewing became simpler and much of what was deemed necessary in the earlier days was discarded.  Many of the techniques and equipment listed here are the results of years of trial-and-error streamlining by other homebrewers.  In addition, there's never been so many resources available via mail order and on the net.  Homebrewing really is easy at this point. <br /> <br />This is the best basic brewing text I've found.  You can start with it by making extract only beers, graduating to specialty grains in addition to extract, then to all grain brewing and making your own recipes and beer styles.  The book is linear, presents the information as you need it and the information ranges from the most basic (like sanitation) to as technical as you could possibly want (water chemistry).   <br /> <br />For years I've been an extract and specialty grain brewer.  I never completely understood the process of all-grain brewing until I bought this text.  It gave me the courage to build my own lautering tun and brew my first batch of beer made completely from scratch.  It was a pale ale, nothing exotic, but man was it good beer.  Check out the author's website and read the first edition online.  The second edition is improved, so if you like the online text buy the hard copy book. <br /> <br />There are other good texts out there (the author lists many of them in the back of the book) but if you only want one homebrewing text, buy this one.  It's a shame that Amazon doesn't carry it anymore.  Track it down.	2004-11-14

I've purchased a LOT of language learning products as of late, and I've found that the quality and effectiveness of learning materials can vary greatly.  I bought the Russian version of this text and was incredibly disappointed.  I was in a bookstore recently and checked out the German version.  Yup, more of the same.  This book might be okay for kids, but it's not a serious learning tool. Learning a language in ten minutes a day may be a fun fantasy, but the resources available in this series of books won't do much to help you learn German.    On the surface the book looks great - big pictures, stickers, activities, flash cards and a laminated \\"pocket pal\\" with a short list of phrases and such. The problem with these resources is that they all fall short when scrutinized individually. There aren't enough flash cards, and the words that are chosen are sort of odd. Some are obvious for the beginner, but many just leave me scratching my head as to why they picked them. The activities in the book are the best part, but as a workbook, it's only average. The stickers are a good idea in theory, but are you really going to put stickers on objects all around your house? The \\"pocket pal\\" phrasebook would be a decent idea, but it's a real pain to get out of the book (I had to cut it out with a razor knife), and it's too big to fit comfortably in your pocket when folded up. Because this book tries to be everything to everyone it falls short on all counts.    One thing you'll notice about most of the five-star reviews listed here for this book is that often it's the only review that the \\"reviewer\\" has made.  I find that very suspicious, don't you?  Click on them and check out their other reviews, you'll find there arent any.  Hmmmm...  can you say \\"sock puppet\\"?    For a popular language like German, there are many good and reasonably priced language materials available that will take you much farther than this text.  The Teach Yourself series is good and comparably priced with a better book and tapes that allow you to actually hear the language.  The Living Language Ultimate German isn't bad at all.  Oh, and Deutsche Welle has free German lessons available on their website.       Here's a note going out on the off-chance that there are people reading this that are really serious about learning a foreign language:  Buy \\"How to Learn Any Language\\" by Barry Farber.  While his method is effective, it requires work and in addition you'll need to budget a bit of cash for materials.  But the materials can be purchased over time and don't necessarily need to be the expensive ones.      Or you can buy stuff like this.  But you won't learn to speak German well and you'll have wasted your money.  It's your choice.	2004-11-09

I recently purchased this, the companion work to the author's definitive book on tube amp design, Valve Amplifiers.  There are quite a few books on how to design a tube amp, but very few resources available on how to safely construct them.  I say safely because vacuum tube amplifiers use voltages that are lethal, some extreme designs using voltages in excess of a kilovolt!  Safety is essential when dealing with tube amps at all times. <br /> <br />Originally, the author covered amplifier construction techniques in the first edition of Valve Amplifiers, but that volume is now in it's third edition and is over six hundred pages long WITHOUT the construction section.  It's understandable that Mr. Jones decided to put out a separate tome on amp construction, since the construction information is as long as the entire first edition of Valve Amplifiers.  <br /> <br />This book goes into great detail on how to build a chassis, wiring techniques, PCB's, metalwork and assembly using only hand tools.  Examples are given of tools to be used (often with more than one choice for a given job) and how to use them properly.  The book then goes on to explain the use of oscilloscopes, distortion measurements and troubleshooting, completely illustrated with pictures and drawings needed to do these things.  There are also useful tricks, such as using a discarded radio tuning capacitor to find the optimum capacitance for feedback compensation. <br /> <br />This, along with Valve Amplifiers, are the definitive modern works for the amateur on how to design and build tube amplifiers.  If you're interested in tube DIY audio, there just aren't any substitutes for these books, they're simply the best currently available, period.	2004-10-02

The same went for vinyl records.  But there were always a few people that didn't buy into the new technology, insisting that tube electronics sounded more in step with the music.  I heard my first high end tube amp (a Conrad Johnson MV-45) in 1987 and I've been hooked on the sound ever since.  Thanks to a series of events that few could have forseen, the DIY tube revolution is in full swing.  The fall of Communism and China embracing capitalism opened the flood gates, making more tube types cheaply available than since the mid-sixties.  Add the internet with it's flow of information, and the underground DIY audio scene was born.  There's an embarassment of riches now available to the amateur Hi-Fi enthusiast, and this volume is one of the best. <br /> <br />I've owned the first edition of this book for several years and it's absolutely great.  It was a logical step up from my first DIY tube amp book, Bruce Rosenblitt's Beginners Guide to Tube Audio Design (now out of print).  The first edition clocked in at 300+ information packed pages, covering everything from the performance of different electronic components used in tube amps, amp and preamp projects to chassis construction and design.  When the second edition came out, I decided not to buy it thinking it maybe corrected some errors and had some new projects.  Now that I've read the third edition, I have a funny feeling that I've missed out.  See, the new edition is over SIX HUNDRED pages long, and that's without the amplifier construction section!  The amplifier construction techniques are now covered in Mr. Jones' companion volume, Building Valve Amplifiers, in itself a 300+ page book.  What this means is if you include the companion volume, there's THREE TIMES the information than in the first edition, over a thousand pages!  Not only is there more, but it's better organized and edited than the first edition.   <br /> <br />Morgan Jones covers just about every tube related subject, not hesitating to offer his opinions along the way.  He doesn't hide his dislike for some current tube audio trends, such as tube power supply regulators and single ended amplifiers.  There's a single ended amplifier project in the book, and while it's not a 300B amp project (he rightly says there are enough of those around), he goes through the project with all the thoroughness and care we've come to expect.  There are several other projects, including a tube headphone amp, the author's original EL84 amp, a more powerful push-pull amp using 13E1 output tubes, his original \\"practical pre amplifier\\" from his first edition, plus a balanced preamp and a new line preamp and phono stage. <br /> <br />The wonderful thing about the projects in this book is that the author doesn't just present the schematic and say \\"build this\\", he goes through every step from tube and component selection to each design choice along the way.  This isn't just a project book, this is a book that teaches you how to actually design an amp.  I haven't built any of the designs in the book (yet), but I have no doubt that they sound very, very good indeed.  And for vinyl enthusiasts, the amount of time spent explaining phono preamps is an absolute treasure.  You won't find this information anywhere else!   <br /> <br />Yeah, it's an expensive book, but worth every penny.  The bottom line is this - if you're interested in DIY vacuum tube electronics and don't have this book and it's companion volume, you're limiting yourself.  I think even crusty old timers that have been working with tubes for years could learn something from this book.  If you've learned everything this book and it's companion volume have to offer, I believe that you could build tube audio electronics that compare to the best that are available, regardless of price. <br /> <br />	2004-10-02

The graphics used in the book are the same as the ones used in the awful \\"Russian in ten minutes a day\\" by Kristine Kershul.  This is somewhat better, but not by much.  Many of the words in the book don't have the stress, or accent displayed, so for those words it's sort of useless.  You get the stress for the \\"spotlight\\" words which are phonetically transliterated (the stressed syllables are in capitals).    I purchased the book and cassette version used for cheap.  In that context - it was worthwhile, but for not much more, the Oxford Press \\"Take off in Russian\\" by Nick Ukia was superior.  If you're really serious about learning Russian, there is no substitute for the Penguin Russian course.  It really is the benchmark by which all beginners texts are judged.	2004-09-23

BUT...<br /><br />When comparing this with something as good as the Lonely Planet Russian Phrasebook, this little book pretty much falls flat.  The words and phrases are not presented in Georgian script and the dimensions of the book are unusual - tall and narrow, so it sticks well out of your pocket.  But it is inexpensive, and it's not really meant to be a serious study tool.<br /><br />Using this along with the two cassete (why not CD's?  AAARGH!) Georgian mini-course by Khatuna Gelashvili would at least allow you to HEAR what the language sounds like.  Georgian makes some pretty interesting sounds that are nearly impossible for an English speaker to mimic, but if you can hear it spoken, chances are you'll at least be understood.  Amazon doesn't sell the mini course, so you'll have to look elsewhere.  There's also an online study course available if you really want to learn this obscure language beyond the phrasebook stage.

Debunking fitness myths and fads, this book is all the information you'll need to develop an excercise routine, regardless of your age, weight and fitness level. <br /> <br />Most people are excercising with the intention of losing fat weight.  It's no suprise that he spends much of the book explaining the body's fat burning mechanisms and how to kick those processes into high gear.  What this does is literally change your metabolism, allowing you to change your so called \\"set point\\".  Anyone that tells you this isn't possible is telling you a LIE.  He gives you the background information that proves it and step by step how to do it.   <br /> <br />He offers very out of shape people hope by telling them (truthfully) that it's easier for a fat, out of shape person to make an improvement in their fitness level than an athlete.  He has a no-nonsense chapter on steroids and their effects.  He explains the proper use of sports drinks and explains HOW they work and what they do.  He talks about weightlifting, wind sprints, carbo-loading, overtraining, cross training and fast and slow twitch muscles.  The only thing he doesn't go into great detail about is weight lifting techniques, but he does touch on it and there's no shortage of books on weight lifting. <br /> <br />It boils down to this: understanding fitness is simple, but getting fit isn't easy.  It takes effort.  When you're through reading this book, you'll be armed with all the knowledge you need to make intelligent, informed decisions about your fitness level and how to improve it.

I don't know about you, but I don't want to learn a language so I can read a newspaper or understand a radio broadcast. I want to communicate with real live people in their own language.<br />How many people take language courses all through high school and even college only to find when it comes time to actually USE the language, they've &quot;learned&quot; it without the ability to SPEAK it?<br />This doesn't happen with the Pimsleur method. It forces you to respond, continuously moving forward, teaching you new things while reinforcing concepts learned earlier. The Pimsleur program is far superior to other audio methods in that it's not just repeating incredibly dull phrases over and over again. You interact with the dialogue. You have to THINK and it reinforces things learned earlier at just the right time intervals. A concept is reinforced more often right after learning, but these reminders become less and less frequent as time goes on and you learn new things. But then what you've learned previously becomes part of new concepts and vocabulary that keep getting put before you, reinforcing those concepts even more.<br />The Key is that you RETAIN the concepts and vocabulary and hence the ability to use the language. You learn correct pronunciation, as the program uses native speakers. You won't be tongue-tied, since you're asked questions in the program and you have to THINK about the answer. You THINK because the question might reference something from three or four tapes ago. You use proper grammar despite yourself because you're not thinking about grammar, you're learning the language the same way you learned as a baby - you're USING it.<br />Is there a down side? Of course. They're ridiculously expensive (HINT: check out the auctions), but have you priced an evening course at your local university lately? The books and materials cost alone would probably pay for these tapes. <br />The other down side is that as good as they are, you'll need to use other resources if you want to go past basic usage. The Pimsleur method will teach you the basics, but using it with other materials is easy and those other materials will be much less expensive. The other bonus is that you'll get much more out of them if you use them in conjunction with the Pimsleur program.<br />I have all four German sets (do yourself a favor and skip the fourth, BTW) and to be honest, I found the Pimsleur series to be the best for teaching you how to pronounce the language correctly.  But it was much more useful with Russian than German, as German isn't that difficult for English speakers to pronounce.  I'd guess that the Pimsleur discs for Chinese and other really difficult languages would be a lifesaver.	2004-04-07

Fred made a decision at that point and didn't look back, throwing the snack cakes he was shoving in his face into the garbage instead.<br />Thus began Fred's journey.  Along the way, he found you don't need fad diets, diet programs, shakes, pills or anything like that to lose weight.  He knew the dirty little secret that every fat person knows:<br />If you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight.<br />It's not your genetics, it's not your \\"glands\\", it's \\"hand to mouth syndrome\\" and \\"sit on your butt-itis\\".  He changed his way of doing things, beginning with excercise.  He started treading water in a pool, because that was all he could handle.  He was persistent and his diabetes symptoms disappeared in a matter of weeks.  He also changed his diet.  He didn't starve himself, he didn't count calories, he just started eating healthy food and stopped eating junk.<br />You'd think this would be common sense, but it's not.  Our society is so ridden with a victim mentality that allows people to lie to themselves and say that they don't have control over their weight.  There are a dozens of experts (all with books to sell) to tell them that it's not their fault.  It's their genetics, their \\"set point\\", the way they were raised, it's the fast food ads, etc.  Fat people are great at deluding themselves and there's an entire weight loss industry that relies on getting people to believe that they can't help themselves.<br />Fred proves it's all a series of choices.  Every day we decide:  Do I get out of the rack a half an hour early and take a 30 minute walk around the neighborhood or do I sleep in?  Do I swing by the drive-through on the way home from work, or do I eat a healthy meal at home?<br />This is not a diet book.  It's a chronicle of his (and his wife Robyn's) internet weblog detailing their weight loss escapades.  Along the way, he graphically describes the ways that obesity destroys one's ability to live life.  As he loses weight, the tells you all about the things that thin people take for granted that he's able to enjoy once again.  It's inspirational and a fun read, but it's not going to give you lots of wiggle room.  Once you read it, there's no more excuses, you either make the decision to lose weight and get in shape or you don't.<br />If you really want to lose weight, buy this book and leave the hucksters in the dust where they belong.	2004-01-28

If you're going on a trip to Russia and only want to take one book, this would be it.  It has a small dictionary, information on aspects of Russian society, things to be wary of and even a page of &quot;bad Russian&quot;!

Maybe I expected more because the Teach Yourself series Russian Grammar book is so much better.	2003-10-28

If you were forced to read Russian literature in high school and felt like you just didn't get it, or worse felt like you were being tortured like I did, give this book a chance.  With a few more years on my bones I now appreciate those other works, but had I been introduced to this book back then, I wouldn't have felt that all Russian literature was like eating a bowl of dust while being hit over the head repeatedly with a rubber mallet.<br />Written with a wry and twisted sense of humor, this fantastic tale is set in the early Soviet Union.  The book starts with two members of the writers guild having a conversation about Jesus when the Devil shows up.  He joins the discussion, predicts the soon to be death of one of the characters, and when this actually comes to pass, it plunges his friend over the edge.  You can take it from there, but it's a far cry from the \\"suffering is good for the soul\\" style from  Dostoevsky and Tolstoy.  <br />By the way, the quality of these everyman's library classics are top notch and a bargain for what you get.	2003-09-15

This is the revised edition of an earlier Penguin Russian coursebook available many years ago.  I haven't seen that text, but this book is the best self study stand alone text for any language that I have seen.  I wish Penguin had the same type of book for German.<br />The book progresses in a very sensible way, all of the things you learn are in an order that builds a very solid foundation before moving on to the next lesson.  At times you will run into areas where the author offers &quot;extras&quot; that he says can be skipped.  My advice is don't.  In the first few chapters the &quot;extras&quot; are pages explaining the correct way to pronounce words.  He claims that you'll be understood if you pronounce the words phonetically as they're written, but why not take the little extra time and get it right?  There's also great information on Russian handwriting, some cultural info (very brief), but the book is all business.<br />One thing that it lacks is a way to hear native speakers, of course.  While it goes a long way trying to explain how Russian is spoken, you won't be able to avoid tapes or some other method of actually hearing the language properly spoken.  One inexpensive way would be Barron's Pronounce it Perfectly in Russian.  The best way would be to purchase the Pimsleur lessons, but they're prohibitively expensive for most people. <br />This book is a great foundation for learning Russian.  It's a bargain.  I also recommend another book by the author, the &quot;Russian Learners' Dictionary&quot;, especially along with the Vis-ed Russian flashcards.	2003-09-15

This is a set of flash cards that roughly corresponds to the 1000 most commonly used words in the Russian language.  They're great.  They're the perfect size, small enough to carry a bunch comfortably in your pocket, but not so small that they're difficult to manipulate in your hand.<br />My suggestion would be to use these in conjunction with the Russian Learners Dictionary by Nicholas J. Brown.  It lists 10,000 Russian words in order of frequency of use.  Use the dictionary, sort through the cards and pick out the first 100, once you've learned those, move on to the next hundred.  Once you run out of cards, you'll have to start making your own, but vis-ed makes blank cards too.	2003-09-15

This book might be okay for kids, but it's not really a serious learning tool.  Learning a language in ten minutes a day may be a fun fantasy, but the resources available in this book won't do much to help you learn Russian.  <br />On the surface the book looks great - big pictures, stickers, activities, flash cards and a laminated \\"pocket pal\\" with a short list of phrases and such.  The problem with these resources is that they all fall short when scrutinized individually.  There aren't enough flash cards, and the words that are chosen are sort of odd.  Some are obvious for the beginner, but many just leave me scratching my head as to why they picked them.  The activities in the book are the best part, but as a workbook, it's only average.  The stickers are a good idea in theory, but are you really going to put stickers on objects all around your house?  The \\"pocket pal\\" phrasebook would be a decent idea, but it's a real pain to get out of the book (I had to cut it out with a razor knife), and it's too big to fit comfortably in your pocket when folded up.  Because this book tries to be everything to everyone it falls short on all counts.  <br />If you want to learn Russian and can only buy one text, buy yourself the Penguin Russian Course if you want an inexpensive beginners textbook and then make your own flash cards.  If you can afford a little more, get the ready made Russian cards from Vis-ed.  For a workbook try the Berlitz Basic Russian Workbook, and then a decent phrasebook like the one from Lonely Planet.  These products are all available from Amazon and may cost a little more in total, but will take you much farther.	2003-09-15

I recommend this book be used with the Russian vocabulary cards by Vis-ed.  Since words are listed in order of frequency of usage, you can look up the first 100, dig out those words from the set of flash cards, then move on to the next 100, etc.  After the first 1000 words, you'll need to write your own cards, but Vis-ed sells blank ones too.  <br />A useful tool, but not the screaming bargain that the author's Russian course is, this is more for the serious student.	2003-09-15

I've been using the method in this book to improve my German and start learning Russian.  I've met with better success than I thought would be possible without taking classes and using a tutor.  The method outlined is effective, but time consuming.  If you just want to learn a few phrases for a trip, this isn't the method for you.  This book is about really learning to speak a language as well as a non-native speaker can.<br />The book is an enjoyable read, the stories in which the author relates his experiences are both inspiring and entertaining.  He's very honest and up front about the amount of effort it takes to really become proficient in a foreign language.  The method tells you how to use materials like flashcards, tapes, books, newspapers and magazines effectively, and what you can expect to learn from each.  All of these things become part of a very effective method for learning.  <br />A lot of ground is covered, including a glossary of grammatical terms, a guide for selecting the right language and a pretty comprehensive list of languages and the number of people that speak them.<br />Since the book is a bit dated, there's no mention of language learning software or internet resources.  But after you read the book, you should be able to find good software (like the Rosetta Stone series), web pages and web radio broadcasts on your own.<br />I go back to the book any time I haven't studied for a couple of days.  It always inspires me to pick it back up and get going.  If you think you want to learn a language, really, really LEARN it, then buy this book before dropping your hard earned cash on expensive tapes, books or classes.	2003-09-11

This book is meant for the absolute beginner, and it's where I started.  I now have many books on vaccuum tube electronics and I can't think of a better way to be introduced to the subject.  It covers subjects like safety, chassis construction and has a few projects in the back.  One thing to mention, though.  If you want a book full of projects, buy Bruce's other book, Audio Reality.  The projects there are of higher performance and more up to date.<br />My main nitpick is the resource section in the back.  I'll just come out and say it:  they're ads.  There's nothing wrong with that, but a lot of the companies are out of business.  Someone that's interested in this subject will likely be able to find resources on the internet.  I suppose it was more useful when the book was written.	2003-09-11
US	41929031	R3PBRHVRWRF47J	0966961102	722773915	Audio Reality	Books	4	14	14	N	N	If you can get past the author's ego, this is a great book.	This book is controversial, but from what I can tell Bruce likes it that way.  The first half of the book is the section where \\"myths\\" are debunked and \\"truths\\" are revealed.  Now, I'm an audiophile and I disagree with him on many things, but there's merit to some of the things he says.  He's paricularly vitriolic against the snake oil salesmen of the high end audio world.  I read the section, agreed with some things, disagreed with many, absorbed what was useful and moved on.  <br />My other complaint is that a good part of the book is spent by the author patting himself on the back and mentioning again and again (and again) that he's an ELECTRICAL ENGINEER and that he's been AWARDED A PATENT for his OTL circuit.  Now don't get me wrong, these are admirable acheivements.  But the way he goes about it gets annoying at times, almost to the point of self congratulatory gloating.<br />But... BUT!  Bruce is to be admired for having the guts (and the generosity) to put the schematics of his very high performance designs out there for anyone that buys the book to use.  Heck, he even has his own website and forum where he helps people with their projects!  The projects are explained with great detail, complete with parts lists.<br />What makes this all the more remarkable is that Bruce is also an audio equipment manufacturer and some of the designs in the book are products that he still sells today.  The OTL (output transformerless) tube amp has been very positively reviewed by some of the most \\"snooty\\" of the high end magazines.  This is his bread and butter and he still puts it out for you to build yourself if you wish to.<br />I may disagree with Bruce, but I respect him.  I recommend this book highly.	2003-09-11

I've been using this for a while now, and while it's not nearly as good as the Pimsleur method, it's much cheaper and has its uses.  The lessons are very short in duration, so you can use these CDs on your shorter trips in your car.  <br />If you're willing to put forth a bit more effort, I would advise taking the time to make flashcards of the vocabulary on the tapes as you go through the lessons.  There are booklets that come with the CDs that have this information.  If you use them in your spare moments, it'll help with retention and also help you learn the cyrillic alphabet.<br />While I can't really recommend any non-Pimsleur &quot;listen only&quot; method as a stand alone product, as part of a larger language learning program these CDs could be useful.	2003-09-11

I don't know about you, but I don't want to learn a language so I can read a newspaper or understand a radio broadcast. I want to communicate with real live people in their own language.<br />How many people take language courses all through high school and even college only to find when it comes time to actually USE the language, they've \\"learned\\" it without the ability to SPEAK it?<br />This doesn't happen with the Pimsleur method. It forces you to respond, continuously moving forward, teaching you new things while reinforcing concepts learned earlier. This series, along with the Penguin Russian course, will take you very far indeed if you want to learn basic Russian that you can use. The Pimsleur program is far superior to other audio methods in that it's not just repeating incredibly dull phrases over and over again. You interact with the dialogue. You have to THINK and it reinforces things learned earlier at just the right time intervals. A concept is reinforced more often right after learning, but these reminders become less and less frequent as time goes on and you learn new things. But then what you've learned previously becomes part of new concepts and vocabulary that keep getting put before you, reinforcing those concepts even more.<br />The Key is that you RETAIN the concepts and vocabulary and hence the ability to use the language. You learn correct pronunciation, as the program uses native speakers. You won't be tongue-tied, since you're asked questions in the program and you have to THINK about the answer. You THINK because the question might reference something from three or four tapes ago. You use proper grammar despite yourself because you're not thinking about grammar, you're learning the language the same way you learned as a baby - you're USING it.<br />Is there a down side? Of course. They're ridiculously expensive (HINT: check out the auctions), but have you priced an evening course at your local university lately? The books and materials costalone would probably pay for these tapes. <br />The other down side is that as good as they are, you'll need to use other resources if you want to go past basic usage. The Pimsleur method will teach you the basics, but using it with other materials is easy and those other materials will be much less expensive. The other bonus is that you'll get much more out of them if you use them in conjunction with the Pimsleur program.<br />If you're serious about learning Russian (or any language, the German Pimsleur improved my German immensely), especially by self study, the Pimsleur program is an incredibly powerful tool.	2002-12-28
