Being politically aware already, I had already heard some of this in newspaper reports before the 2000 election and couldn't believe that more people weren't alarmed just by the facts about George W. Bush and what he did in Texas, or how insidious and elusive the truth was concerning what all his father was involved in.  This book fleshes out not only the trickles of truth that had already emerged concerning the Bushes (and the neo-conservatives' self-serving loyalties), but a whole - and in terms of the welfare of the average American - terrible long term agenda.  Read this book.  It is not propaganda.  The man did his research and the truth is what it is.  Then tell everyone you know about it.  I have.	2004-01-16

Boy!  Is it an important book!  Mr. Baer reveals the bloody-mindedness, deadly indifference and ignorance that has ruled our government's policies with the Saudi royal family in its determination to maintain its access to cheap oil.  No one comes out of this expose as clean, including virtually the whole current Bush administration and pretty much every administration going back to WW2.  I wish that something could be done politically about this poisonous relationship we have fostered with the Saudi Royal family, but with G.W. Bush and his oil company minions in office I expect everything will continue in the manner in which Mr. Baer depicts it in his excellent book.  Tell everyone you know about it. Give copies of this book out as gifts.  Reference it when you write to Congress.  I certainly intend to.	2003-08-15

Books	5	8	9	N	N	Such fun	Suffering from a bad case of cabin fever and needing an escape from the news, I went out and blundered across this book at a book store ...  The cover art snagged my attention and the daffy illustrations and chapter and section headings within persuaded me to buy it at once.  I could just see Dr. Evil referencing this book on a daily basis as he takes on Austin Powers yet again.  It's that kind of fun.	2003-04-04
US	52797002	R3GBRCOW4FX6VK	0971865906	291676723	A Reader's Manifesto: An Attack on the Growing Pretentiousness in American Literary Prose	Books	5	7	13	N	Y	Important and Decidedly Overdue Commentary	This is such an important book that anyone who reads fiction whether genre or 'literature' should read this slender, but potent paperback, and then they should pass it on to a friend.  One of the things that struck me is that the same elitism that strangles  diversity of style in art, unless it is abstract or post-modern (ie., obtuse) is apparently rampant in the rarefied 'genre' of literary fiction.  I had become aware already of that particular, hypocritical glass ceiling as a writer during my quest for a publisher.  I had read in Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own what a great failing it was to let your authorial voice suddenly dominate a narrative, thus disrupting its proper flow, but these critically rewarded writers do just that with appalling regularity.  Myers calls a spade a spade and cites ample examples of these failings.  Also, as a so-called genre writer, it was made clear to me that I had to stick to the rules of clarity, concision, and so forth.  Established writers who had been allowed past the red velvet rope into literatureland were not just allowed to murder those simple rules for good writing, but were praised for doing so.  I found the double standard puzzling then, but now I would rather stick to the classic rules for coherent writing than succumb to the malaise that has infected the works of Proulx (never mind the rest of her stream of consciousness lists, her sentence fragments alone I found absolutely shocking in a mainstream product), DeLillo, and McCarthy.  I especially loved the 'Ten Rules for 'Serious' Writers' that concludes this book.	2002-10-11
US	52797002	R69NYMB8MX8TS	038550098X	591346591	Last of the Amazons: A Novel	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	WELL RESEARCHED, GRIPPING FICTION	I'll admit - I was caught up in it and was impressed.  Years ago I had read Kleinbaum's THE WAR AGAINST THE AMAZONS, which covered the various depictions of Amazons in the arts: literature and film particularly.  In that book she listed all the novels that had been written up to that time and synopsized them.  None of them sounded interesting to me because they didn't seem to have come close to even the original myths.  This novel though is different.  Pressfield did his research and in some ways his depiction of the Amazons is more humane, more centered, and less didactic than previous authors' depictions have been.  He is telling an epic story based on classical legends and apparently also on recent archaeological evidence and not forwarding some agenda - women better than men, men better than women, the whole Amazon equals Lesbian blur.  I appreciated that aspect of this novel.  Pressfield really made an effort to imagine what the 'Amazonian' tribes might have been like.	2002-07-11

It probably shouldn't have, because I know I would have been more freaked out than the man it actually happened to, but the way they wrote it out - prolonging the suspense - was great.  I like that they also stress the folly and danger of meddling with black magic and ouija boards.  That can't be stressed enough.  You could devour this interesting book in an evening.	2002-07-01

As a work of philosophy, it belongs up there with the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, the Dhammapada, anything by Plato, Balthazar Gracian, and the Book of Proverbs in the Bible.  And like the Meditations or the Dhammapada, it can be applied to one's daily existence in truly important ways.  It should be included in Philosophy courses in college or even High School courses if at all possible.  Get this quote:  'These days negative karma is causing the entire environment to be filled with evil, and individuals are preoccupied with unwholesome influences.  This produces deceptively attractive situations that are a mixture of good and bad, where words and actions contradict each other.'

This is truly an important and timely book that touches on everything that vexes our society today - women's rights, where men fit into the modern society, racism, and how religion has played an unfortunate part in keeping women down, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  It is a dense and challenging, but worthwhile read.  And when you get your copy, pass it around.  It should be shared.  PS. Someone should tell Bill Maher about this one.

Just like the other book, this one was very insightful about the sort of deep-seated cliches applied to women in the arts - the virgin/whore/child-bride/vamp, etc.  After reading it, I sat down and had another look at my own writings and tried to eradicate all those crippling, limiting roles from my female characters.  One only wishes that this sort of thoughtful re-examination of female archetypes would be applied to more novels and films especially.	2001-05-22

Suddenly I saw these beautiful, lithesome, sinuous or passive figures of women as statements of deep-seated fears and misperceptions about women and non-white, non-Anglo Saxon Europeans during that era.

He does not wish to convert. That is not  his agenda.  He is considered the 14th incarnation of the BUDDHA OF  COMPASSION and that tells one a whole lot right there.  His agenda, if he  has one, is to help his persecuted people in Tibet and maybe help the rest  of us find a way to lead better lives despite all of our surface  differences.
