I read this book in a span of 24 hours I could not put it down - at 1 am I tried to go to bed after starting the book but finally after tossing and turning I turned the light back on at 4 am and didn't get out of bed until I finished. <br /> <br />I loved all of her characters - even the bad ones were really interesting! Almost every one of her secondary characters is interesting enough to get their own story and hopefully the ones that survived this story will find their own story in the future. I was shocked and saddened to see one of the secondary characters killed off - I would like to have seen him have a happier ending - And I have to admit one of \\"bad\\" characters that is killed in the end had me kind of bummed.  <br /> <br />The author draws you into so many different characters lives and she does it expertly!  I cannot wait until the next book comes out! <br /> <br />THIS IS A MUST READ!!	2005-06-19

I really, REALLY, loved the idea of the book! It reminded me a lot of the book Posession by A.S Byatt. I found it interesting how she pulled off writing the contemporary portion in the 1st person which set it off from the third person historical story.  The story was rather funny and now that I have read it and have read the other reviews I can see why many people believe it really should have been for a younger reading group.  I still think it was a very good book for a first time author and many parts of the story had me laughing. <br /> <br />The things I didn't like about the book.  <br /> <br />1) The price - I really wish I didn't have to spend $20.00 to read this book - I will probably purchase the next book used if I decide to read it. - Obviously this is not the authors fault. <br />2) The hero and heroine both drove me a bit crazy. I didn't find Amy smart at all - obviously Jane was the brains behind everything. and even the hero of the story was a bit stupid - I mean how could he have not been caught for years?  He returns from England after a fortnight and pulls off a jail break that very night - how could he not be suspected as being a spy? Very stupid.  I think the main characters were two stupid people that had smart people picking up the pieces for them. My god even when Amy tries to get The Purple Gentian out of the interrogation room - it is his mother that is the one who breaks in with the gun to rescue her son - Amy is too busy showing her assets to the guards.   <br />3) I wish that she would have ended the book with a bit more about Eloise and Colin - she leaves you hanging on which may or may not be a good thing - since follow up books usually take a year or so to be published it will be interesting to see how many people will still be intrigued with the story to pick the next one up.  <br /> <br />After finishing the book - I will admit if the next one was available I would have picked it up and continued to read - but 2 days after finishingthe book I am no longer invested in the characters and really am not sure if I would spend $20.00 for the sequel but perhaps wait for it to come out in paperback. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-09

I just loved her latest book. It gave her readers a chance to read Rob Sutter's story as well as visit Gospel Idaho (The town from True Confessions) again!  I loved that - since that was the first book of Rachel's that I had read. I loved both Rob and Kate in this book.  I could not put the book down and finished it in less than 24 hours.

I read it in one day - just couldn't put it down!<br />Why not 5 stars?  It has nothing to do with the writing - which was great! I just didn't like how she portrayed the hero and heroine from Pirate Next Door.  It seemed to me that Grayson was a little to entranced with Diana's beauty and that given the opportunity he would have slept with her.  It seemed like the only time Alexandra came to his mind was when he was reminded of her.  If they were real people I think his behavior would have been quite telling.  I would think that while he was off helping the government and leaving Alexandra home that he probably was sleeping with other women.  Which even though I didn't like Pirate Next Door - I hate to think that the hero of that book was possibly still sleeping with other women.  I mean we know his behavior with women before his marriage was horrible - we are even given examples of it in this book.  <br />The last thing - I wish the epilogue was an actual epilogue showing James and Diana's life and not Grayson and Alexandra. I don't think we really needed to have James and Diana's relationship discussed by Grayson and Alexandra at the end.	2004-07-17

I can understand why some people were annoyed in the beginning by the male behavior in the book. I don't think her brother inlaws behavior was really all that bad I mean family members tend to tease each other.  I hate to say it but her betrothed's behavior at the beginning of the book was probably a more accurate account of how men viewed and treated their wives during the regency period.  I think the author could have explained more about what happened between his father and Victoria's father to make it a more stand alone book. Obviously one must read the other two in the series to find out what went down.  I have to say though once I got to the middle of the book when his illegitimate children begin to show up I couldn't put the book down. I ended up staying up most of the night to finish it.  I can't wait to go back and read other Grasso novels.	2004-07-16

I was really looking forward to this book since I do love the more erotic writing of Cheryl Holt, Emma Holly, and Nicole Jordan. And the premise of this book would really make you think that it was going to be steamy!  Wrong!  The first thing that drove me nuts was that the Viscount states he had once been in debtors prison. During the regency period a peer of the realm could not be thrown in debtors prison.  Another thing - the viscount began to sell girls to old men for marriage to get money for his entailed home. It didn't sound like to me he would have had such a bad reputation had he not started peddling flesh. I'm sure he could have found a rich banker's daughter to marry instead of selling young women.  I thought the book would be filled with erotic scenes from the start - but no! There really was only one erotic scene towards the end of the book.  I didn't think that he taught Lynette anything more than she could have taught herself - in fact it sounded like he taught Audra and the other girls much more. It also sounded like he loved all the Marlock girls - I really didn't think he had any real chemistry with Lynette.  I actually don't think Lynette had any real chemistry with him either - she was ready to marry another man when he twisted her boob and played with her hand - actually that was more erotic at that moment then anything the viscount did to her.  Another thing that threw me off was the mention that Lynette had a chipped front tooth. In my mind I imagined a giant chip out of the tooth and could no longer think of her as attractive.  I also was ready to throw the book across the room after the 100th time that she mentioned that Lynette was a minister's daughter!  The main reason Lynette was searching for a rich husband was to get her brother a commission and her sister a season. At the end she stays with the Viscount who although his debts are paid will obviously not have the money to payfor a season for her sister or a commission for the brother.  I think that the book could have been much better if there was an epilogue at the end that showed the couple living happily in the future.  I just don't get the feeling that this couple would make it through the test of time.	2004-07-10

I was really getting into it until the hero thinks about being beat up when he was young for being stupid and that his father thought he was stupid and yes we learn through his actions that he is indeed not the brightest bulb out there.  First off he burns the notes that could have been possible clues and he can't understand half the things that Anna is talking about. He just reminded me of a big dumb puppy dog.  I think if she left out the part that Rein wasn't very smart this book would have been 5 stars since he would have turned out to be a charming hero I can't understand why she felt the need to make her character dumb. I just can't imagine a smart girl like Anna truly being happy in the long run with Rein.  Also why was this book called scandal?  We never see the character do anything scandalous.	2004-07-10

I have read every Eloisa James book and was really disappointed with A Wild Pursuit - but she has redeemed herself with Your Wicked Ways.  I loved this story!  If you have read the other books in this series - then you know Helene and Godwin and it was so nice to see them work out their differences. I couldn't put the book down!

I usually can read a book in 1 or 2 days getting so caught up in the story but it took me a week to read this book. It was so boring.  Finally toward the end I just started skipping sections.

There were some really funny parts with the Cinnamon Bread that had me laughing out loud but I saw another reviewer say they thought this was a filler book for the next book which will probably be about Jason the younger twin.  I think she is right.  <br />I was left thinking that Catherine wasn't really into writing this book.  <br />I agree with other reviewers too that poor James and Corrie's story could have been amazing but was just boring since they were basically part of a filler story.  I would have much rather had the story without all the other junk put in there; At least with more of James and Corrie's thoughts. There was no thoughts from either of them for example James struggling with his new found attraction for Corrie or vice versa.  It was like oh we need to get married - okay.  I felt really cheated by that - and I know Catherine has it in her to write amazing books with great characters!  I just felt that she made James and Corrie 2 dimensional and boring because she wanted to use the book to build up to Jason's story.   <br />The sex was so glossed over too - first off there was no sexual tension - no even with the first kiss - for either twin and their beloveds in the books.  And I know Catherine can write better love scenes. Once again I just think this was a book to fill people in on what was going on to start the next generation of Sherbrooke stories - and poor James and Corrie's characters were the sacrificial lambs -with a shabby love story - that could have been amazing!<br />Of course I will read the next one though - because I think it will be much better.<br />I also hope that Devlin gets his own story too!	2004-03-09

I was determined not to like this book - just because I was mad that it wasn't going to be about the secondary characters (Ian and Caro) from Complete Abandon.  But Cheryl is one of my fave authors so I snatched it up as soon as it was available and read it in 24 hours. I just could not put it down - even when the sun began to rise and I realized I had been up all night reading. The storylines that are going on: Olivia/Phillip, Edward/Winnie and Penny/Freddie as well as Margaret's manipulations was so was perfect!! The characters were great!! Cheryl has the amazing talent to create characters that you just love to hate while you are reading. I'm giving fair warning: If you do not like sexy/steamy books then you will not like this - the erotic feel of the book starts on the very first page.  But if you love a more racy read! You will find this book irresistable!  I am looking forward to Phillips' Sister's book coming out in the Fall.	2004-03-07

This novel had too much of a Jane Austen style of writing with a bit of sex mixed in.  <br />Eloisa James is a great writer.  But I just couldn't get into the 3 storylines that were going on at once + all the other misc. dialogue between other characters.  <br />I know this got 41/2 stars from RT magazine - but I found it a bit boring and didn't mind putting it down.  At the end I started skimming through the book.<br />I didn't like Bea - I thought her character was annoying - she was so shallow (I know Eloisa was trying to give her a bit of depth - but I didn't see it). I didn't like the age difference of 20 year between her and Stephen.  I doubt Bea will remain faithful when Stephen is 53 and she is only 33.  <br />I was so looking forward to esme and Sebastian's story - but I really disliked Esme in this story (loved her in the last).  I thought she was so damn annoying - and if I was Sebastian after the thousandth time she told him to leave and that she was sure the child was Miles I would have ran!! <br />Helene.  Well I like Helene and I a am skeptically eager for her and Rees's story next month. I think it could be really great or another bummer.	2004-03-02

I have been eagerly awaiting Lucinda and Robert's story!  I wish Suzanne would come out with a book every 6 months instead of once a year - it is hard waiting for them.  <br />If you are a fan of the Lesson's in Love series - you will be satisfied thoroughly with this book - since you get to revisit all the characters from the other books.  <br />I can only hope that her next book is about Bradshaw!	2004-02-26

I disagree with the first reviewer who said that you did not get to know Sebastian and that he was not likeable. I think that he was. I think his behavior was perfectly suited to his position as Captain. I do think his behavior sometimes towards Olivia was more Medieval - but I chalked that up to him possibly being the reincarnation of the Black Earl (that is just what I supposed). I also have to disagree with the first reviewer that said there was no sex until page 330. There were tons of erotic scenes throughout the book. Also Harriet K - said that the amnesia thing was a bit much - but I didn't think so - she couldn't remember just one day of her life - which does happen in traumatic circumstances.  And I have to admit I think Olivia's character was so likeable that my eyes filled up with tears at a few of the scenes dealing with her poverty or her attempts to fade into the background.  I would have given this book 5 stars (I couldn't put it down and read it within a 24 hour period) but there were a few things that bothered me and left me feeling unfulfilled at the end of the book.  1) James. The reader never gets to find out his or Olivia's reaction to Sebastian marrying Olivia.  I felt a little cheated by that.  I hope that she writes a book with James as a main character - he wasn't such a bad guy.  2) I didn't mind the murder mystery taking a backseat but I just wished that the whole black earl thing was a bit more settled by the end - was Sebastian and Olivia the reincarnations of the black earl and his wife? Was that why when they started the seance that Sebastian's head began to pound etc?  All in ALL I really liked this book! It was the first that I read by Carolyn Jewel - but I am going to head out and purchase Lord Ruin tomorrow.	2004-02-20

I just go irritated with Aline.  What made this book a winner was the secondary storyline of Livia and Shaw.  I started flipping past Aline and McKenna's story to get to Livia and Shaw's.  I wish that they had a whole book.  I also thought it would have been great if Lisa put Aline and Livia's brother together with Alex (I think that was his name) - he was the homosexual lord.  I was kind of dissapointed with the ending. She really didn't go into any detail - yeah we figure Aline and McKenna marry and go to New York - and we know that Shaw comes back for Livia. I just wish she gave us more at the end. It was almost like she was bored with her own book and rushed the ending.  I'm not saying this isn't a good book - I just have higher expectations for Lisa's books.	2004-02-09

Not because the writing was bad - but I just couldn't get passed not liking Theresa. Michael just seemed like such a great guy - I really wished he had met another woman and got Theresa out of his mind - she didn't deserve him - she deserved someone shallow like Reese.  Half way through the book I lost respect for Michael too - He is a Hockey Player - and can have any woman - why waste his time chasing after an idiot like Theresa?  She doesn't decide she wants Michael until after she realizes Reese is using her - poor Mike is second choice to her.  I doubt a marriage in real life would last between the two of them.  If Ms. Martin writes another book - I am sure I will read it but I hope the characters are more likeable.  I loved Body Check - and I thought that the chemistry between Michael and Theresa would be great for a second book - I thought there would be humor etc. But I just felt like Theresa was a hearless self-centered loser.  Her not wanting Michael because he was Italian and a hockey player just rang false.  Maybe that kind of plot works on a a soap opera but it doesn't in a book.  They don't end up together professing love until close to the last page of the book.  It was irritating and I feel like I wasted 2 days of my life.	2004-02-08

It really was very interesting. What was the problem?  It was a very frustrating read.  The book could have been a 5 star incredible read if it was just organized. Even though the book is broken up into dated sections - she did not keep to the dates and would float back and forth into the past and future. One moment you would read an agent was executed and then 2 pages later she would be talking about him and the prison he was in.  One minute she would be discussing 1804 the next 1799. If she had written the book in chronological order it would have been much easier to understand. Also it would have been a lot easier to understand what was going on if she discussed the important battles that were going on at the time.  I had to have a book about the Napoleonic War sitting next to me so that I could see what was going on with the armies etc. This book could have been amazing if she brought the agents to life on the page. It was hard to understand what was going on with the agents when she would go back and forth in dates.  Hopefully some day someone will take all this information and make a more interesting and understandable book.	2004-02-02

I know people are allowed to have their own opinions so I must respect those of the arm-chair historian that read this book.  In defense of the book - I must say (even though I have had a course on the civil war - I was a history major in college) that I really didn't notice any major historic mistakes.

I had to force myself to finish the novel. I would have thrown it aside before reading the whole thing but I invested so much time in reading the other 3 previous books and learned to love the characters so I didn't want to miss out on something by tossing the book aside.  Duclairc and Fleur could have been such great characters but they were both so dull in this book - even the ending was dull.  The mysterious Hampton and even a new character mentioned Maclean were much more interesting in than the main characters.  Perhaps she will write books about them. I would probably read them - right now I am nursing a headache from struggling through this book though and at present don't think I would want to torture myself with another book by her.  But I do have to say on her behalf that I did like the other 3 books in this series and would recommend them - Madeline Hunter is a good writer but this book just lacked heart and was rather boring.	2004-01-07

You need to pick up some non-fiction about the 19th century to realize that there were many men that were virgin's in their late 20's.  The one example that comes to mind is John Ruskin - who even after marriage did not bed his wife.  I think Mary Balogh made Ferdinand such a believable character - he was emotionally scarred by his mother's and father's infidelity.  He lived with his mother and watched her float from one lover to the next - perhaps in real life I would have said he was a latent homosexual but this is a damn fiction and a romance to boot!  With that said on defense for that portion of the book - which I might add is a small portion of the book. This book is probably one of the best that I have ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I usually like the funny historicals or the very steamy ones and one would think this book would have been steamy but Mary brings these two likeable characters to life - you feel for both of them and when Ferdinand takes on Dirby - my eyes welled up with tears!  You should read More than a Mistress first - and you will see that Ferdinand's brother was also messed up by his parents behavior. I think Mary has a great grasp on human nature!!!!  READ THIS BOOK - Ignore the idiots that scoff at it not being a typical story for the regency era - they just are too idiotic to think outside the box.	2003-12-31

I will warn you not read further when it gets to the spoiler point.  I have just started reading Mary's books after reading the first three Bedwyn books. But this book I believe is my all time favorite - that I have read from any author.  I usually like funny historicals but this book just took my breath away.  SPOILER - I know many may not like it because she has taken the usually virginal regency woman and turned her into an ex-courtesan and the virile male is the actual virgin in this book but that made the story even better!  I was a history major in college and trust me - the 19th century is not at all like what we read about - women were sometimes forced into prostitution and Mary has taken the story of one such character and shows you how she had to build walls around herself to protect her mind and her heart.  There are many scenes that you will find your eyes welling up in - at least I did.  I hated letting these characters go in the end - they were just such likeable and incredible characters - I am sure this will be a book I read again and again.	2003-12-31

I was mildly disappointed in this book though. It was good but not nearly as well written as her last books. I also found it a bit boring. RT Magazine gave 3 1/2 stars and I have to agree.

I know this is a newer author - so that may be the reason but - it just lacked something that would have pushed it into a 4 or 5 star rating.  There were some basic mistakes that annoyed me and the writing seemed rather simple. Since I found the plot interesting I did not just put the book aside after reaching page 79 and being thoroughly annoyed (didn't like the female character) - I trudged through skipping over sections to see how it would end. I may pick up her next book if it is about the bad pirate (who I liked better than Finley - who just seemed like a wimp).  She has potential - so I won't give up on her writing completely yet.	2003-10-21

I cannot believe that the romantic times reviewer had the nerve to give this a 3 star rating and to say that (I don't have the review in front of me) but something to the effect that readers are getting sick of the Bridgertons(I love the Bridgertons I was tired of Lady Whistledown and found the quick letter blurbs from Eloise much more interesting and fun) In fact one of the best parts of the book is when the 4 Bridgerton Brothers find their sister. I honestly thought that this was one of the best books in the Bridgerton series - much better than Colin and Penelope's story. It was both funny in some parts while it tackled issues of insecurities depression and abuse. If you like Julia Quinn - you'll love this book.	2003-07-08

It seems like he was sacrificed to make Annie's wish come true.

It was an enjoyable read. I have read one of her other books Romancing Riley and that was good also.  This book however just felt like it lacked a certain something to make it a 4 star book. Sometimes I found some of the writing confusing - who was thinking what etc. but she did a great job of building interest in characters that I am sure will be in the next book from her, namely the Duke of Ravensfield and the american heiress. So I am sure I will read the book if that is the case.	2003-06-08

There are parts that are really funny - especially when batsman tries to be lady's maid - but I just found Charlotte too annoying to like and I just wanted to hit her for her misuse of words and found that boring and further pushed her into the slot of most annoying female character ever written.  I don't think I am going to try to trudge through another of Macalister's books.

I waited all year for this book to be released and although I felt it a bit hard to get into in the beginning - I got caught up in it rather quickly. The secondary characters are a great addition to the book. I would have given this a 5 star rating except that I felt she wrapped the ending up too quickly and I didn't feel like the couple really had a chance to reconcile and that if this was real life - a relationship with them wouldn't work. Also without giving too much of the story away - I just wonder what happens with her father and his 17 year old bride they are a major part of the book and their storyline is completely dropped at the end leaving one to wonder what happens to them. The book needed another chapter to resolve everything - instead of feeling completely satisfied with finishing the book - I feel somewhat cheated. Don't get me wrong she is still a great author and the book is highly entertaining and I will surely read her next one.	2003-02-03

She creates well rounded characters that can never be viewed as all good or all bad.

I bought it and found the beginning a bit boring. It annoyed me that the cover models don't really look like the book description. Don't authors give the damn art dept. a description. I mean Michael Wright most of the book wears a patch because he lost his eye. Tally is suppose to be unattractive - the girl on the cover isn't beautiful but she is more attractive then what the book describes. Okay so that is now point two against reading the book. I know I may be in the minority - but I want my lead characters attractive. I assume a lot of people read books and want to believe that less attractive people can have beautiful/attractive people fall in love with them - but come on! I don't imagine myself in the role of the lead female - I read it like I watch a movie - I am a viewer of the story unfolding and not dreaming that I am the heroine. And I know it may sound bitchy but I want my hero or heroine attractive. So I was irritated when they first take a roll in Michael's bunk - It was like yeah the lights are out any female will do whether attractive or not. So I debated on throwing the book aside and thinking that maybe it is time to give up on Ms. Adair - Maybe she only had a few good books in her - but I figured I would persevere a few more chapters and then BAM! All of a sudden I started getting caught up in the book - she ended up making Tally so likable that when someone made a remark about her being less then pretty - you wanted to hit the person for her. And she expertly unfolded the attraction that Michael was feeling for her until he saw her as beautiful because of the person she was on the inside. And you couldn't help but love her - she would be a great friend to have.  My favorite part of the book - which probably was when I figured I would finish the book is when Lucky the 3 legged cat is hissing at Tally and then falls over and pretends that he meant to do it and Tally picks him up and puts him back on his feet so he canhiss at her some more - I thought that was so adorable, since I know a 3 legged cat that acts just like that. So Okay this book kind of got off to slow/boring start - annoyed me a bit - and then turned into a very good read that I didn't want to put down - so I guess I will be reading more Cherry Adair after all.	2002-09-02

I really enjoyed the Seduction of Sara and I loved this book too! With a little tweaking, The St. John family could give Julia Quinn's Bridgerton's a run for their money.  As the other reviewers state, Anthony and Anna's chemistry is quite fun to read about, especially if you read The Seduction of Sara.  MY ONLY COMPLAINTS - THAT KEPT ME FROM GIVING THIS BOOK 5 STARS are the following: 1) You never really get to see or read about Anthony and the children warming up to each other - there are no heartfelt scenes between them where they discover that they care for each other. 2) In the beginning we learn that the eldest Desmond is old enough to go to eton but does not want to leave his brother and sister's behind to be seperated (which is what his grandmother said would happen) I would like to have seen this resolved in the epilogue.  3) RICHARD! Ugh the whole book he does not speak! Was he deaf? We read in one paragraph that he is watching his sister's lips while she is reading a book and then in the next we are told it looks like he wants to speak. This is never resolved. We never learn what happens. I assumed that these little things would have been dealt with in the epilogue but weren't - I can't stand when things like that are left unresolved. These are the reasons I could not give it a 5 star rating.  Hawkin's has such promise and I can't wait to read her next St. John installment. I just hope she learns to resolve issues that arise in characters better.	2002-08-04

I believe the 2 star reviewer is wrong when she states that the characters do not act in accordance to the time period.  Not everyone forllowed such strict moral standards or acted missish and frail all of the time - if that was truly the case, women would not have come as far as they have. Also there were several ladies in that time period that were fighting for a more equal balance between men and women.  And also, just look around today at all the different values and beliefs and many people are just naturally inclined to thumb their nose at society.  I am sure that this was the case in the regency period also.  In fact I have read where in real life a duke of that time period kept his wife and mistress under the same roof and even Prinnie's mistress was more accepted by the ton then his wife.	2002-08-01

I always know that when I pick up one of her books, I am bound to enjoy it.  And the new one is no exception.  It is a worthwile read.  The only thing I found odd with the book was that in one scene at vaux hall Deb meets an old family friend of her mother's and he asks her to visit him and she says she will, and then he and his wife are never mentioned again.  I kept thinking when will he spring back up in the book - it seemed like the scene was going to lead somewhere and didn't.  I wonder if it originally did and was edited out. Oh well, it was just something that stuck with me.  If you like Cathy Maxwell this is a MUST READ.	2002-07-05

As you may have figured out, in this installment of the Bridgerton series, we finally find out who is Lady Whistledown.  Although I would love to blurt it out, I will let you read the book yourself &lt;smile&gt;.  In the past 3 Bridgerton Books, you catch glimpses of Poor Penelope and all you can do is hope that someday she will get her man Colin Bridgerton.  Well finally she has her own book and indeed she gets her man. The only complaint that I could have with this book as that They barely spend much time together before Colin is falling in love.  I wish Quinn played the romancing part out a bit more. But it still was a great novel that I could not put down and in fact read in 1 and 1/2 days.  I really can't wait to read Eloise's story and I wonder where she disapeared to?	2002-07-03

The only thing that kept it from being a 5 star in my book was that she didn't really allow you to see either couple getting to know each other and falling in love. I can only recall 2 segments for each couple, otherwise she wrote that weeks went by and that the couples were getting alon and then bam both couples were in love.  I didn't feel like I have a major interest in whether the couples stayed together or not.  I did find the book a charming read though. But not at all romantic.	2002-07-02

The one thing that kept it from being a 5 star in my book is that she spent so much time writing out the charactgers thoughts, that after a while I found myself getting bored. Also I really didn't think that a marriage would work in reality with these two and when she decides to bring them back together, they fall right in with each other again even after all the pain that was felt in their 6 months apart.  I also wish the author let us know what happened to Pamela.  I mean if Sarah was willing to forgive her husband she should have forgiven Pamela.  Well they were just my observations and I must say that by page 317 I would not have forgiven Michael, but that doesn't make a good romance novel.  I know that this doesn't sound like I liked the book, but I really did enjoy it. I just wanted to point out some parts that I found took away from a 5 star rating.	2002-07-01

A lot of the middle part of the book could have been left out and more added from the marriage forward..  I just felt like the ending was rushed.  I would like to have found out more of what happened with the aunts and Robert and Liza - this could have been remedied with an epilogue.  I have noticed that with a lot of books lately, the story just starts getting really interesting and then ends.  I just felt a bit cheated - like I said this would have been a solid 5 stars if a few pages of epilogue was added.	2002-06-23

I thought I would like this book after reading the review for it in romantic times.  Uggh.  I know many readers will disagree with me, but I can't stand plain heroines.  I don't read books for reality I read them to be swept away into another world, I want my Heroines pretty and my heroes handsome, I don't want them dowdy or plain.  Okay so in reality a handsome man (although I assuming the male character was equally appalling due to his scar - although I don't find scars unnatractive on men - the author made it seem like he was quite ugly.  Who really want to read about to ugly people.  Not I.  Along with all of that I just found it boring.  I thought from the prologue that it was going to be good but I was sorely mistaken.	2002-06-21

Since I finished the book and thought is was great and cannot wait to read the other 2 in the series, I decided to look at the reviews again.

Having read the Lord series by Jeffries, I quickly realized that she has a habit of intertwining her characters and stories so much that the books are confusing if trying to read them out of sequence.  So I put the book aside and picked up A Dangerous Love and a Notorious love, and it was well worth it.  Both of those books are great and this is no exception.  This is a great addition to the series if you read it in order.  It is so nice to revisit characters, Jeffries just makes it important to read her books in order.  Other authers such as Julia Quinn and Kat Martin who use characters from different books don't put as much emphasis on the plots from the other stories, Jeffries does, but it is well worth it if you read them in order and if you don't, you feel as though you are missing something important.  GREAT BOOK though if read in order.	2002-06-11

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I did get bored with it at about 130 pages and was debating on finishing reading it since I already know from Minx what happens with Alex and Emma.  But I read through the boring stage and it was well worth it because the ending is great.  I am glad I read Minx first though becuase I would have been bummed reading belle's story and not having her and dunford get together.

I disagree with the other reviewers that believe that Blake wouldn't have fallen for Caroline.  I believe he would have.  James said that she had the same type of personality as Blake's ex fiancee and his ex would have died at around 22 or 23 years of age.  And 5 years was a long enough mourning period for him to finally realize he could love another woman.  I have to admit I did want to strangle both characters on several occasions for their constant bickering but I thought the epilogue was so sweet, we got to see how many children etc. they had through the diary entries.  julia Quinn always adds such sweet touches like that.	2002-06-06

I enjoyed this book, but I really didn't like the female character at all. Okay so Suzanna was fat all through school and then she gets skinny and seduces her grade school/highschool crush and she has major issues with getting pregnant and fat.  She hides so much from Tim, from the pregnancy to the fact that she is having twins etc.. I know he doiesn't tell her the main reason for marrying her but she needlessly tortures him throughout the book.  I just found her vindictive and I really don't fell like either of the characters loved each other or that a marriage in the long run would work out between them.  It was nice to see Keely, Jack, Aunt Sadie, Joey and Sweetness again though.  This is a good read for those who read Jack's story and want to see what is going on with all of the other characters otherwise the book just has too much lying and boring fighting to be really great.	2002-06-03

I started reading her matrix books and loved them!  The problem is her last matrix book in the series so far was a lousy read.  When this book 1st came out I thought the idea was interesting and was tempted to buy the hardback.  I am so glad I only wasted money on the paperback.  I got to page 150 and finally stopped torturing myself and put it down.  It was ridiculous!  I disliked all of the characters.  The whole premise that these strong men would be led around and treated so poorly by the weaker sex (Yes we may be the smarter sex - but I hate to admit we are the weaker) and the idea of a society where men are treated like children is stupid! Also, I am 33 and yes I have dated men younger than me and even married one that is 4 years my junior but I still can't get into the whole ten year age difference between the female and the male character in this book. And come on not since the clockwork orange have I had to refer to the back of the book for a gossary of terms!  STUPID!!!  I'm sorry to say that maybe Dara Joy's days as an author are numbered.  Maybe a person only has so many good books in them to write and she has already written them all.

I counted 3 kiss scenes and no description like many of the authors want to give of tongues sweeping into mouths etc etc etc.  It is very G rated and I can see by looking at reviews of her other books (that I am debating on reading) that reviewers have complained that the other books weren't really romances because of the lack of romantic scenes.  I want to partly agree.  I kept expecting the great love scene and the passion, which this simply lacked, but I did find it enteraining, and did enjoy reading it.	2002-05-07

They were amazing.  This was okay compared to them.  The 1st 2 books I could not put down and read in 1 or 2 days this one took me almost 4 to read.  I suffered through a lot of parts that were quite boring.  I think the problem with this story actually the plot is an example of what I once read.  It said that a reader can become completely bored with a story if the misunderstanding that drags the plot along can be easily fixed early in the story if the 2 characters just talk.  And they say that this is a problem many new authors have, but Jeffries is not a new author and since I know that her other books were great this use of a shabby plot was disapointing.  I don't know if would have finished the book if I hadn't read the 1st 2.  If Ian had just told felicity his secret in the beginning the book could have been finished in 1 chapter also I wanted to strangle felicity most of the book.  One more thing that annoyed me is that in the 3 books we never find out if Sara and Gideon had a boy or girl.  At the end of Pirate Lord they are back in London for the birth of their child.  In the 2nd book we find out that Emily and Jordan have a son and in the 3rd they mention Sara and Emily going into a nursery at Sara's house but never mention if Sara had a son or daughter.  That bothered me a bit.  Oh well enough venting I'm sure I will still read more of Jeffries books.	2002-05-03

She seems to write sweet love stories.  They lack the sensuality of other romance novels but they make up for it with great well rounded characters.  Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down.  I just loved the characters!  The only thing I would have wished was different in the writing is that Maxwell used the word 'twas way too many times.  I know it is a historical but it just was a bit annoying.	2002-04-25

You can get caught up and read her books in one day.  They are always sweet and very g-rated.  Although I usually like more sensual books and love scenes her books can be a breath of fresh air.  I thought this book was very sweet. I agree that it wasn't funny though.  You and No Other had funny chbaracters, but the villagers in this book were hypocrites and not funny at all.	2002-04-24

I thought that her next book would possibly be Grayson's story to follow on finding out who Lord Calibran is (That is the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5) she leaves us hanging for another book and it doesn't look like her next book is going to be one to tell us who the traitor is.  I have a feeling it is either The Duke that is betrothed to Raven or possibly Dare... I guess we will have to wait and see.  I just hope that I remember the plot by the time the next intsallment of this story comes about.	2002-04-23

I love how Kasey Michaels fills her book with wacky and fun loving characters.  Sometimes her romance seems to take a backseat, but with everything else going on it doesn't take away from the book.  There are several parts of this book I laughed out loud while reading.  If you love fun books you will love this. I can't wait to read Jack's brother Tim's story!	2002-04-20

But there were a few things I just found lacking in this book. I didn't really like the main female character and I hate to say it, but I usally don't want to read about frumppy female leads in books.

I love how she allows you to meet secondary characters that you will find in future books.  The one thing I wish she had done differently in this book was to just introduce Gwen and Adam.  I found that I was excited to read their story as much as the main characters Matt and Jessie.  And was a little bummed when she quickly had Adam rescue Gwen and marry her.  I thought there could have been another good book there.  If you love Kat Martin you will love this book.	2002-04-07

I almost stopped reading the book altogether.  Although after he was caught he admitted his love for Cait and proceeds to try and win her back.  I read romance for the fantasy that a man can be faithful (not like reality - which has proven infidelity a norm) I want the main character to show some power over his desire for other women once he meets the heroine.  I am not of the school that believes once a man cheats he can then see the error of his ways and become faithful.  If Cait was my friend no matter if Rand risked his life for her or not I would have told her to not go back to him.  I did finish the book because I did enjoy it and I did like the characters except for that one part.  It was a good read if a little off putting.	2002-03-26

This still is a 5 star book.  I have read a few of the other reviews that complain again about Allegra and King Lazar. I believe Foley had to make them a little distant as parents so the real characters in this story could stand out.  Rafe and Dani were both such great characters and Orlando was a great villain.  You could almost feel sorry for him and then bam he did something so incredibly evil.  The homo-erotic spin was quite interesting and I thought it showed how Orlando was obsessed with having power over anyone and everything and was willing to do anything to gain that power.  I also loved that she gave Serifina and Darius 6 children in this book.  If you loved Pirate Prince and Princess then this is a must read.	2002-03-25

I read the other reviews and do agree that Foley should have written a bit more about Darius being kept as a slave like King Lazar had.  Also I do agree that Lazar and Allegra were not at all how I expected them to be as parents and found that a bit disapointing, but I believe they needed to be that way to push the main characters into acting the way they did.  As for Serifina and Darius - Wow - what a great story.  I could not put it down and read it in one day.  I was so sad when it was coming to an end and I really do hope that in Prince charming she does not make them meaningless secondary characters like she did with Lazar and Allegra.  I just finished the book and the characters seem so fresh in my mind I do not want to let them go yet.  I found there love for each other and insecurities so real.  Even when Serafina was acting selfish and foolish it was realistic I remember how I acted at 20 when I was first in love and the foolish things you would do to try to keep the man.  All I can say is that this is one of my favorite books and Gaelen Foley is fast becoming one of my favorite authors and if you haven't read her other books, the duke, lord of fire, lord of ice and the pirate prince, you are missing out on such great stories and characters.	2002-03-24

The dialogue taht Lori gives Josh is so &quot;real life&quot;  he really sounds like a 27 year old modern guy.  I am now a devoted Lori Foster Fan!	2001-12-01

In fact, I read both books back to back in 2 days.  I was so excited to read this one, but I found it didn't hold my attention. It was a good book, I just thought it could have been better.  In the last book we know Rowanna wants to search for Quentin, and like an afterthought she adds that a messenger finds quenting to tell him about his sister in New Mexico.  I just felt cheated a bit with this book.  I really hope she wrties another one with the siblings so we can see them all reacting with one another again.  This is a good book and a must if you are reading the trilogy, but it just disapointed me a bit.	2001-11-25

I loved all of the Mackade brother books.  I thought my favorite was Devin's story until I read Shane's.  I really loved this book.  Since I read all four I will put them in my fave order now:  1) Shane's story 2) Devin's Story 3) Rafe's Story 4 Jared's Story.   I didn't think this story would be good - because of the way his character although was briefly touched in the other novels just seemed blah - but she really brought him to life in this book!  I hated that it ended.  All I can say is READ IT!	2001-11-18

I liked the characters but they just seemed to lack something.  I have read all of her books and have been blown away by them!  She is one of my favorite if not favorite authors and she still is.  But if I was given this book to read without knowing it was cherry adair I would have never guessed she was the author.  I still have doubts that she was.. maybe one of her grown daughters wrote it?  Hmm.  or maybe her heart really wasn't into writing it.    But I still love her.  I guess all authors have a mediocre book in their past.	2001-11-14

I had been dying to read the story of Devin and Cassie since the return of Rafe Mackade.  Nora Roberts did a great job with these books, I love how each character seems to be a reincarnation of the ghosts from the past.  I thought this was the best so far (I haven't read the fall of shane yet though).  I like Rafe and regan together and I think Jared and Savannah's story was okay (although I don't really like Savannah's character all that much) but how can you not love Cassie and Devin!!

The only thing that I wish the author did not leave out was the birth of the baby.  I felt cheated that I didn't get to find out if they had a boy or a girl.  I didn't think that was fair.  If she hadn't left that out I would have felt more satisfied at the end and this would have received a 5 star rating instead.	2001-10-21

I had a problem with the characters in the beginning.  I am the same age as the characters in the book and have some friends that fit neatly into the profiles of the character.  My problem was I hated the whole SWINGERS epidemic that hit the club scene a few years back &quot;your so money&quot; etc... No matter how hot Ben Estes was in reality the moment he said &quot;baby&quot; and &quot;pallie&quot; etc.  I would have run for the hills.  And Sophia was a bit annoying too.  They reminded me of the too pretty couple that really have nothing to go on but their good looks.  After all that is said.  I did enjoy the book.  I found some of it funny and think Kylie Adams has a fun writing style.  very now.	2001-10-20

I am glad that I changed my mind.  This novel was great.  I can see where people complained that the romance wasn't really steamy.  There maybe was only 6 pages of romance (sex) in the book.  So if you are a die hard wanting to read sex scenes every few minutes, this book is not for you.  However, if you want to read a great book with a group of fun loving eccentric characters, this book is for you.  I thought it was a great book.  I don't think Kelly was overly whiney (Maybe a tad but... - it fit the character), but Seth was perfect.  I also liked how she added characters from her other books also.  It was nice to read about Corrigan again.  So if you haven't read this book, don't go by the reviews on this page.  Pick a copy up yourself and maybe read a chapter or so at a bookstore.  If it grabs your attention read on - I am sure you will enjoy it.	2001-10-17

I ended up reading this from 10pm lastnight until 10 am this morning when I finished it - I should have known once I started to read this book, that I would be in trouble since the same thing happened when I read Kiss and Tell.

At the end of the book she mentions the artist of the Robin Goodfellow painting as being Thomas Gainsborough.  So I looked him up and found a gorgeous painting of a man that fit the description in the book which was fun since the cover model on the book really didn't do the character justice.

The only thing that I didn't like is that the book did not give updates on the main characters from the last books.  This book could have been read without reading the others but since I did read the others I was a bit bummed that she didn't reintroduce the characters.  I was expecting to find out what happened to the characters from Grand Design.  At the end she says that Delgatto is meant to be similar to Autolycus from the show Hercules.  I can see that.  Without watching the show I pulled up a site and saw a pic of the actor and that is exactly what I would have expected Delgatto to look like.  That was interesting. Besides wishing she had brought back some of the other characters I must say that this was one of my favorite books so far in the series.	2001-10-03

But I really liked this a lot.  I think how Dimitri acted when he was told that Cynda was from the future.  He didn't believe her and he didn't want to hear stories about the future.  That is realistic.  If somebody came up to me and said they were from the future I wouldn't believe them either.  This is a good book and is worth reading.	2001-10-02

I started reading the book at 9pm lastnight and stayed up until 530 am when I finished it. I could not put it down. I kept telling myself that I would just finish one more chapter then go to bed. I one more chaptered myself to the end. Sophy could have been me or anyone of my friends with her insecurities and typical girl body issues. I kept shaking my head with some of the thoughts about herself and thinking my god I have felt that way more than once around a man. Maybe because I read this book coming off of a few contemporary romance novels I would have only changed the ending bit. Or I at least wished that the authour had an epilogue. I wasn't ready to give up on the characters and wished there was a bit more. But all in all this was a fun read and well worth the purchase.	2001-09-23

I just felt like I was getting to know the characters and I didn't want to put the book down.  i wanted to find out just what happened with Parker and Meg.  There were a few strings left untied... maybe there will be a sequel in the future... I want to know more about what happens to them...	2001-09-18

This is the 3rd Rachel Gibson book I have read and I just have to say she is a wonderful writer. I enjoyed the characters and all of their flaws. The bad review I read above about Georgeanne being an bimbo etc. must have been written by a very jealous writer who just wishes he/she had the talent to write books that draw you into their little world. I see where they kept there name anon too. Well all I have to say is that I love her books and am so glad that I discovered her.	2001-09-05

Maybe i just couldn't get into this book after reading 2 Rachel Gibson novels back to back which I adored.  I found the character of Kate so very shallow.  I know she was suppose to be fearful of getting into a  relationship, but I don't think the author gave me any real redeeming qualities that could really make me like her.  I just kept thinking Mike should have just let her go and found someone appreciative of his attention.  I know we are suppose to believe deep down she has a heart of gold, but I tend to believe that she is as self absorbed as she says she is and that the marriage won't last.  This was the 1st Julie Ortolon book I read and can't decide if I would trust reading another.	2001-09-04

I actually bought true confessions in the airport and got so into it that I was sad when it ended. It was a very funny book, as well as romantic. I was so bummed when it ended that I had to run out and buy another one of her books. I must admit she is an addicting read! I just finished Truly Madly Yours and loved that too! I just wish Hollywood would discover these books, they would make such great romantic comedies!	2001-09-03

I actually bought true confessions in the airport and got so into it that I was sad when it ended. I immediately picked up Truly Madly Yours and fell in love with the book. Man Ms. Gibson is making me want to move to Idaho and find a man. Nick is just too sexy for words. Always loved a guy who dresses in faded levis and tshirts... I am going to buy another of her books tomorrow. I am addicted!.	2001-09-03

Until now, I have stayed away from romance novels.  As I was perusing books in the store I stumbled unto I Dream of You and decided to give it a shot.  I am so happy I did.  It was an adorable quick read. I stayed up all night to finish reading it.  I loved th character Ben. Maddie could have been a little bit more fun though.  I wish the author did not rush the charachters of Al and Haji, I wish they had a bit more of a role in the book, also the relationship that is quickly started between Al and Maddie's bestfriend.  It would have been nice to have seen another book written about their budding relationship.  I could see this book being turned into an adorable romantic comedy for the screen.	2001-08-21

He lived in Germany and I lived in Philadelphia.  Needless to say since I knew  I would never run into him again I kept the book only to loan it out and  never get it back.  I have bought 3 copies over the years from used  bookstores only to loan them out and not have them returned.  If I am lucky  enough to get this book again, It will not leave my apt.  I wish someone  would turn this into a movie - It would be incredible on screen.  THIS IS A  MUST READ!	2000-03-27
