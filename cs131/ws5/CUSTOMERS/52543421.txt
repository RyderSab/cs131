The book's recent appearance on the Modern Library's &quot;100 best books of  the century&quot; list caused me to fulfill that resolve.  I found  Baldwin's novel slow and difficult going. While its themes -- generational  struggles between fathers and sons; the black experience in white America;  tension between the religious and secular -- are undeniably  &quot;great&quot;, I could not say so for the book as a whole.  Certain  passages and sections, particularly the son John's struggle with and  ultimate conversion to his father's church, are magnificent in their  writing and power.  I found the rest of the story, however, confusing and  unengaging.	1998-11-15

D'Orso, a journalist, tells the story of Rosewood, Florida, a small, black, paper mill town that  was basically wiped off the map when white vigilantes believed that a black  man from Rosewood had raped a white woman.  D'Orso makes clear that, at the  time Rosewood was occurring, it was national news, appearing in the New  York Times and elsewhere, yet Florida law enforcement personnel simply  stood by and allowed the carnage to continue.  D'Orso basically tells two  stories: First, the massacre itself, as recounted in both contemporary  sources and in the memories of octogenarian and nonagenarian witnesses in  the 1980s. Second, he tells of successful efforts to bring a claims bill  through the Florida legislature to compensate, however meagerly, the  survivors and their descendants.  This is not a portion of our past for  which we should have any pride; however, the story must be told so that, if  at all possible, this history does not repeat itself.	1998-11-14

I could not bear to look at many of the pictures. The story she tells -- of  the brutal murdering, rape, and desecration of Nanking in 1937, causing  several hundred thousand deaths -- was just too much for me.  This is a  story, however, that must be learned and read. Beyond the individual tales  of torture, rape, vivisection, beheadings, and rapes, however, are the  larger questions.  First, the events of Nanking were front page news (with  photographs) in the New York Times and other sources as it occurred, yet  apparently little western reaction ensued. How can the world so easily  accept genocide or democide?  Chang's comment: &quot;Apparently some quirk  in human nature allows even the most unspeakable acts of evil to become  banal within minutes provided only that they occur far enough away to pose  no personal threat.&quot; (As Chang notes, the modern equivalent to Nanking  is the nightly CNN tapes of Rwanda and Bosnia, again seen in the comfort of  our homes).   Second, and mercifully balanced against this corporate  apathy are the few heros, Europeans and Americans, who created a  &quot;safety zone&quot; in the city and saved perhaps hundreds of thousands  of lives.  She describes John Rabe, a Nazi party member resident in  Nanking, as the &quot;Iskar Schindler of China&quot;. Stories such as the  Nanking Rape, the Jewish Holocaust, and other modern holocausts must be  taught and remembered, or they bear even greater likelihood of repetition  than the already depressing scorecard from this century shows.	1998-11-14

All, including the builder, tell Jocelin that this is  impossible, as the building lacks adequate foundation. Nonetheless, Jocelin  persists, going mad in the process.  While much of the writing and language  of this book is first-rate, I found it difficult to either pay attention or  follow the plot.

In broad outline, Kadare tells the story of the fall of the &quot;west&quot; and the  coming of the Ottomans in fourteenth century Albania.  The central  occurrence in the novel is the building of a bridge.  During the course of  construction, several acts of sabotage occur.  Several possible saboteurs  are suggested (the holders of the ferry-boat concession, for example, are  likely suspects), but one man is finally &quot;caught&quot; is interred --  buried alive -- in the bridge's middle arch.  Kadare does a wonderful job  in establishing mood, tone and atmosphere.  Much of the book appears as if  it might be allegorical to the modern situation in Albania, but I do not  know the history of that country well enough to be sure of this.   Regardless, however, of whether Kadare meant a modern allegory, this  haunting story stands firmly on its own as, perhaps, a modern classic.	1998-11-14

Milan Kundara's Unbearable Lightness of Being, Kadare's Three-Arched Bridge (above) do so much more than tell a story and  draw characters.  They define places and moods with great style and  subtlety.  Hungarian novelist George Konrad's A Feast in the Garden falls  into this marvelous class of books.  The &quot;story&quot; Konrad tells is  not linear, and might not be considered even a story at all, the way it  switches from place to place, time to time, and character to character.  It  is a serious work, dealing both with the pogrom of the Jews under the Nazis  and Soviet oppression during the 50's and 60's, but the author's tone is  not one of unremitting grief.<br />Like the Kundara novel, I believe this book  might best be read on a series of summer afternoons, at a European sidewalk  cafe, as people pass and friends drop by.  The cafe is important to  Konrad's world.<br />One brief description, by the intellectual womanizer  Janos while visiting Jerusalem, is worth quoting in full: &quot;There he  was, a city loafer, sitting in an Arab cafe in Jerusalem because he could  not find a decent Eastern European Jewish cafe.  How can one wait for the  Messiah without a decent cafe?  Where do you think the Messiah would go  first, where would he start his preaching? In such a cafe, obviously.&quot;   Many more such delights await the reader of this fine book.	1998-11-14

However, Berube's book also has a larger purpose and context.  He tackles how our society labels persons like Jamie, and how this use of  language influences the child's outcome.  For example, in the early part of  this century, the common medical name for Jamie's condition was  &quot;Mongoloid idiot.&quot;  This term certainly expressed what society  thought such children were capable of; predictably, the common medical  strategy was to give up on these children, institutionalize them, and move  on.  With the passage of time, terminology has changed, and Berube argues  that this change both reflects and directs society's view of its members.  <br />The biggest struggle for Berube as a parent, and for us I believe as a  society, is to get beyond -- or change entirely -- the labels given and  focus on the persons and capacities behind such monikers.  Berube's son,  like my three (fortunately not &quot;differently abled&quot;) children, is  a unique person, and to overemphasize the name given to his condition (or  the stereotypes invariably called forth) is to shortchange both Jamie, his  parents, and all of us. Berube sensibly does not argue that Jamie would be  without problems if everyone failed to name his condition.  He makes plain,  however, that there is more to destiny and parenting than name-calling.  A  very important and moving book.	1998-11-14

In her book,  Heyrman shows that the evangelistic groups in the south at and shortly  after the American Revolution allowed leadership roles to women; opposed  slavery; and espoused other &quot;liberal&quot; ideas.  She shows how the  growth of what we now label &quot;traditional values&quot; came about, with  the result of male dominance, segregation, and other attitudes we now  associate with the &quot;Bible Belt.&quot;  Heyrman is a gifted writer;  although this is unquestionably a work of serious scholarship, her argument  is both lucid and lively, and she peppers her account with many interesting  characters.	1998-11-14

So-so &quot;story.&quot;	John Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil has been on the NY Times hardcover bestseller list for almost four years.  While I do not for a moment classify it as a &quot;great&quot; book, I see readily its  popularity.  Berendt writes in essence two books, both set in Savannah,  Georgia.  Part One of this non-fiction work consists of a series of  profiles and vignettes of a series of remarkable Savannah characters.  Each  of these characters is memorable, and several are hard to believe.  Part  Two basically takes one of the characters introduced earlier, a wealthy,  single (and gay) antiques dealer, Jim Harrison, who is accused of murdering  a young male employee at his Savannah mansion.  The trial descriptions go  on far too long (in part, this is not Berendt's fault, as Harrison goes to  three trial, the first two resulting convictions reversed on appeal before  a final acquittal). We discussed this book recently in our AAUW book group  (which includes men).  All of us (save one) enjoyed the book, and all  agreed that the first part of the book was far superior.  I will be curious  to see the movie.	1998-11-14

The child, Lia, in Fadiman's book is a Hmong infant, whose family emigrated from Laos to the  United States in the 1980s.  Lia has a life-threatening epileptic  condition, and the cultural chasm between traditional Hmong beliefs and  western medicine proves insoluble.  Hmong, like many, non-Cartesian  peoples, believe that illness, death, and other life circumstances are the  result of actions taken in the spiritual plane.  They respond to illnesses  or conditions with shamanistic medicine and traditional techniques.  Lia,  living in central California, becomes the object of logical western  medicine which has scant regard (or simple open disdain) for the Hmong  ways.  When the two sides cannot communicate, tragedy ensues as Lia is  taken for a time from her parents, her condition deteriorates, and  recriminations fly.  Anyone looking at the interactions of two cultures --  and the genuine difficulties in cross-cultural communication and  collaborations -- would do well to read this non-judgmental, gracefully  written book.	1998-11-14

A 5++	I am convinced that Jane Hamilton is one of our finest living novelists.  Her first two novels, The Book of Ruth and A Map of the World were magnificent.  Her most recent book, The Short History of a Prince is in  many respects her most ambitious.  Her main character is Walter, a young  man who must come to grips with his homosexuality and the fact that he is  mediocre, at best, at ballet, the thing he loves the most.  Hamilton tells  the story in chapters which alternate between Walter's teenage years (at a  time when his older brother, an &quot;all-American&quot; type, is dying of  cancer) and his mid-thirties (when Walter has accepted his sexual  orientation, but is still isolated from his family and alone).  I must say  that my usual reaction to &quot;gay&quot; themes in literature, and  particularly scenes of physical love or affection, is that of many men,  that of squeamishness.  Hamilton, however, is such a strong writer that  Walter as a character, his loneliness, and search for love (both physical  and metaphysical) wholly won me over.  This is a wonderful book, which I  recommend to all readers of serious fiction.	1998-11-14

The landscape and setting are as much a character -- a  clear physical reality and motive force -- in this book as are the persons.   Gunther nicely balanced careful police work with brisk narrative drive.  I  recommend this book, especially for northern winter evenings spent reading.	1998-11-14

Jeffrey Bolster's Black Jacks: African American Seaman in the Age of Sail, is a fascinating history skillfully told.

I likewise  did not know that the pre-civil war laws of South Carolina and other  southern states, requiring free black sailors to be imprisoned at their own  expenses while in southern ports, which led to the decimation of the black  merchant marine.  Bolster handles both the larger historical questions and  the individual sailors' stories with great skill.  He has compiled many  original sources, including diaries of the sailors, to flesh out the lives  of individual black men earning a living and mastering a trade. He also  tells how the individuals, and often their officers (almost exclusively,  although not entirely, white) dealt with the prejudice of the time,  particularly the rising paranoia in the south.	1998-11-14

It was therefore with great excitement that I checked out from our library Nuland's recent The Wisdom of The Body (in softcover, the book is titled  How We Live).<br />I was disappointed.  Nuland, a surgeon and professor of  surgery at Yale, is at his best in describing medical events and systems in  the context of case histories.  The few times he does this in Wisdom make  for both compelling story-telling and instruction.  Unfortunately, much of  Wisdom reads like an introductory primer in human medical systems.  This is  a worthy goal for a book, and Nuland does it well, but it was not what I  expected.  His basic thesis, that the &quot;wisdom&quot; of the body  consists of complex, adaptable systems which by their very variability  sustain homeostasis, is persuasively argued.  However, Nuland showed in his  earlier book that a serious medical argument could be (and was)  successfully made both through anecdotal case history and exposition of the  broader principles involved. <br /> Nuland misplaced the fulcrum in the  balance of his most recent book, with unfortunate results.  He is, however,  such a fine and humane writer that I eagerly await his next work (as I do  his new column in The American Scholar).	1998-11-14

Smith, while well-meaning, is unable to communicate  with anyone, and leaves much anger and confusion in his wake.

First, what a wonderful topic for a work of non-fiction.  Second, how can one possibly write such a book?  I am thrilled to report  that Manguel has succeeded beyond all expectations.  Both a personal essay  telling of Manguel's own learning to read and encounters with books and a  highly eclectic survey of books and reading through the ages, History  provides both erudition and levity, scholarship and wit.  In broad outline,  Manguel groups his books in two sections.  In the first, &quot;Acts of  Reading&quot;, he tells how reading itself took different shapes during the  ages, including being read to, picture reading (books made up of pictures  for the non-reader), reading silently to oneself, and other matters.  The  second part is captioned &quot;Powers of the Reader and deals with the  forbidden reader (e.g., pre-emancipation slaves in the American south);  translation; prophesy; and other matters.  Manguel quickly becomes an old  friend and companion.  I hated to see this book end!	1998-11-14

Finally getting to it five years later, I must admit to some disappointment.  Doyle  tells of ten-year-old Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Clark's life in Barrytown,  Ireland.  The writing is episodic;  Doyle goes from scene to scene -- Paddy  among his friends; Paddy at school; Paddy with his family -- without any  clear plot.  Much of what happens is very funny.  The concluding chapters  -- where the &quot;plot&quot; at last becomes clear -- are sad.  Throughout  the book, however, I found my attention wandering significantly, and I  often could not recall what I had already read when I went to pick it back  up (my four-year-old daughter has the habit of at times removing or moving  my bookmarks, with predictable results). Others, however, adored this book  (it won the 1993 Booker Prize), so I will not disuade anyone from reading  it. But for whatever reason, Paddy Clark -- unlike Doyle's marvelous The  Snapper -- did not do it for me.	1998-11-11

This was the principal attraction of Thomas Mallon's 1994 novel Henry and Clara.   Henry Rathbone and Clara Harris were the son and daughter respectively of  Pauline Rathbone and Ira Harris, prominent Albany residents who found  themselves unmarried, with children, following their spouse's deaths.   Pauline and Ira married; Henry and Clara were raised in the common  household as brother and sister; Henry and Clara fell in love and married;  and tragedy ultimately ensued when Henry, over time, went mad.  Henry and  Clara Rathbone are an interesting footnote to history, in that they were  guests in the Lincoln box at Ford's Theatre on Good Friday, April 14, 1865,  and Henry was himself wounded at the same time Lincoln was fatally shot.    A central question in Mallon's novel is what caused Henry's madness.  Was  it the seeming &quot;unnatural&quot; marriage; was it Henry's horrifying  experience as an officer in the Civil War; was it Henry's presence in the  Ford Theatre box; was it simply fate or heredity?  Mallon does not --  indeed cannot -- answer this question.  While this book was well received  critically, I found my interest wandering through the first half of this  novel.  Mallon redeemed himself mostly through the harrowing accounts of a  marriage slipping into madness following the assassination.  (I much  preferred Mallon's magical novel, Dewey Defeats Truman, a very different  book based on another &quot;historical&quot; theme).	1998-11-11

Like her earlier book, Ekland (who writes in  Sweedish) sets her story in the harsh world of the artic circle, and makes  the climate and landscape central to her plot.  This novel tells the  mysterious death of a man named Matti, apparently killed in a brawl at a  mah-jongg party turned sour.  Initial police investigation revealed  nothing, and it is only the arrival of Matti's inquisitive friend David the  following summer which re-opens the case.  I will not spoil the surprises  -- and they are many -- by describing the plot.  I will say that with this  book, unlike many mysteries which seem (at least to me) to have all the  writerly craft of a vacuum cleaner owner's manual, Ekman carries the reader  along as much with her sly prose as with the plot.  A particularly  effective devise is writing the penultimate chapter in the first person of  the villian, when the rest of the book is in the third person, generally  from the viewpoint of David and the somewhat ineffective policeman,  Torsson. The reader does have to pay close attention, though, or a key turn  of events or clue will quietly slip by.  Before Blackwater was translated  to English, Ekman had written seventeen novels in Swedish. I, for one, hope  that her publisher makes available to us these earlier works.	1998-11-11

Jacob Haym, a prisoner in a Jewish ghetto toward the end of  World War Two, is mistakenly caught out after curfew, and ordered to the  camp office.  While there, he overhears a radio report that the Russian  army is nearby; amazingly, the camp officials allow him to return to the  ghetto.  When he tells the others what he has heard -- that salvation is  perhaps 300 miles away -- no one believes him until he makes up the lie  that he has a secret radio (Possession of a radio by ghetto inhabitants was  a serious infraction, punishable by death).  This single ray of hope,  though, is not enough for his neighbors and co-workers; since Jacob has a  radio, surely he can give them more frequent updates.  Hence, Jacob becomes  a &quot;liar&quot;, inventing radio reports of the war coming ever closer  to the camp, and with its approach the promise of salvation.    The role  of hope in the midst of seeming hopelessness is central to Becker's stark  novel.  Jacob tries to &quot;give up&quot; his lies several times, but  discovers that the community has come to depend on him.  With the advent of  his radio reports, suicides in the ghetto have stopped. A different  &quot;spirit&quot; is in the community.  If Jacob stops his wholly  fictionalized &quot;radio&quot; reports, the former hopelessness would  return.  What is better: a pleasant lie or unblinking verity?       Becker's novel does not make for happy reading.  Hope, in the end, was a  chimera.  Nonetheless, this is a magnificent book, and worthy of wide  readership. Becker's characters -- every one of them -- is fully drawn, and  believable.  One truly feels Jacob's dilemma, and his absolute frustration  with the role of &quot;sage&quot; he has unwittingly thrust upon himself.  The book jacket indicates the book has been made into a movie -- I will be  lookingfor the film at our local video store.	1998-11-11

Telling the story of ten-year-old Matti Lodi and her travels from Kentucky to Indian Territory (now  Oklahoma), Askew attempts to retell the Cain and Abel story, in the  struggles between Mattie's father John and his older brother Lafayette  (significantly nicknamed &quot;Fate&quot;). In the novel, Askew seems to  pick up and then drop again several threads of story and character.  The  book, however, contains two wonderful set pieces.  The first is the death  of Mattie's mother and the family's arrival in Oklahoma at the home of  Fate, who had forged ahead. Second is the showdown between the two  brother's, resulting in Fate's demise.  Askew tells and retells this same  event successively from the viewpoint of several characters, each narrator  adding his &quot;take&quot; on the events.  One would think this re-telling  of the same thing, which takes the final third of the novel, would wear on  the reader, but Askew handles it with great aplomb and suspense.  She is a  very promising writer.	1998-11-11

Because of this unfamiliarity, I do not know with what to compare  Robert Laxalt's novella Dust Devils.  In broad outline, the plot seems pat,  almost cliche: teenaged boy wins Arab horse for bronco-riding in rodeo;  horse thieves steal animal; boy and best friend -- an Indian -- take off  after thieves and regain horse; boy shot by thieves and nursed back to  health by shaman and Indian girl whom boy loves; boy and girl decide to  marry in traditional Indian rite; boy's father -- a life-long Indian-hater  -- renounces life-long prejudice and embraces new daughter-in-law and her  tribe. And all of this in just 102 pages! What redeems this book is  Laxalt's unerring gift of description and character.  His world -- both  moral and physical -- rings true.  Having never read Louis L'Amour or any  of the popular western novelists, I do not know how Laxalt's book compares.   I do recommend it. (I also commend our local librarian for adding this  book -- published by the University of Nevada Press -- to her collection.   One of the particular gifts of local libraries and thoughtful librarians is  the placement of obscure or unfamiliar books on the shelves which the  community can sample for &quot;free&quot;).	1998-11-11

Saskia White is a precocious and extremely well-read  twelve-year-old, whose real life takes place in an outdated upstate New  York commune, and whose fantasy life includes Odysseus, Horatio Hornblower,  astronomer Tycho Brahe,  Marco Polo and others. A loner, Saskia finds a  best friend in newcomer Jane Singh.  Paradise is both regained and lost  when Saskia and Jane are invited on an environmentalist protest tour by  Saskia's long-absent father, Thomas, and Jane and Thomas fall into an  (apparently) sexual relationship.  Because of the sexual themes, this book  is probably not appropriate for young teenagers.  Hall, however, tells a  marvelous, funny, and serious coming-of-age story.  I was disappointed when  the book finally ended -- I wanted more.	1998-11-01
US	52543421	R1MW9VEDC2CLFI	0679767924	236199661	Independent People	Books	5	22	22	N	N	An Icelandic epic	Every year, I try to read at least one classic work of fiction, whether I  need to or not.  So far in 1998, my choice has been Halldor Laxness' 1946  Nobel Prize winning novel Independent People.  This is a book which I had  never heard of until it was re-issued in English (the original is in  Icelandic) in 1997.  Laxness, who subtitles his work &quot;An Epic,&quot;  tells the tale of sheep-farmer Bjartur of Summerhouses, and his life-long,  monomaniacal struggle for financial independence.  In the process, he loses  two wives, a son leaves him, and his dearest child -- Asta Sollilja  (&quot;Beloved Sun-Lily&quot;) -- is disowned. Only by losing all of his  wealth does he find what he truly values.  While styled &quot;an  epic,&quot; this is also a whimsical and lyrical work.  Bjatur, in addition  to farming, is a bit of a poet, and the most remarkable extended scene is  Bjatur's desperate struggle with bitter cold in the wilderness while trying  to find a strayed sheep.  In the middle of the night, to keep his senses  and way, he returns to his muse:<br />      'Seldom had he recited so much  poetry in any one night; he had recited all his father's poetry, all the  ballads he could remember, all his own palindromes backwards and forwards  in forty-eight different ways, whole processions of dirty poems, one hymn  he learned from his mother, and all the lampoons that had been known in the  Fourthing from time immemorial about baliffs, merchants, and  sheriffs.'<br />Ultimately, the poetry keeps him alive as he finally crawls  his way on all fours to safety.  I found myself reading this book in  short doses so that I could savor the language, and so it would not end too  soon.  If someone was with me in the room as I read, I found myself  inflicting upon them sentences or whole paragraphs, just to savor the  felicity of language and expression.  I concur with Jane Smiley's cover  blurb: &quot;I can't imagine any greater delight than coming to Independent  People for the first time.&quot;  (Reading this novel and Smiley's remarks,  it is clear where she derived many of the themes, descriptions, and  grandeur in her 1988 novel Greenlanders.  Smiley's work, however, is a much  darker book).	1998-11-01

William Dietrich's  Northwest Passage: The Great Columbia River filled much of my knowledge gap  with a fascinating and well-told story.  Dietrich recounts the history of  the Columbia, from its original creation through geologic forces and its  discovery by Lewis and Clark and other explorers, to development of the  river and the region by forestry, fishing, and industrial interests,  harnessing of the river through multiple dams (including the huge Grand  Coulee dam), decimation of the salmon population and later attempts by  environmental and Native American interests to revive the salmons, and turf  wars between various interest groups.  Dietrich's book is extremely well  researched and annotated, but reads not like laborious scholarship but like  a labor of love.  He clearly loves the region he writes about and is  troubled by its many changes; he conveys both his enthusiasm and in-depth  knowledge through this graceful book.	1998-11-01

Together, they make an amiable pair and good reading companions.  It is  daring, indeed, of King to take up the Holmes &quot;mystique&quot; and  tradition and make them her own.  I am not enough of a Conan Doyle expert  to point out any sins of character or detail which King might have  committed.  Her book, however, stands on its own; I recommend it for  beach-sitting or lazy afternoons.	1998-11-01

One of McCullough's first books is The Johnstown Flood (1968).   This short (for McCullough) history of 286 pages tells how, during terrific  storms, an earthen dam above Johnstown, Pennsylvania burst, causing the  death of more than 2,000.  McCullough is superb both at analyzing why the  dam collapse was preventable and in describing the course of the flood  itself, including its wake of tragic deaths and amazing stories.  This is  not a happy read, because the tragedy was both so huge and so preventable  (A sorry epilogue of the flood is that none of the several lawsuits was  successful). It is, however, so spellbinding and well-told that it begs to  be read in one sitting.	1998-11-01

Krackauer's work is both a philosophical inquiry and  mystery.  The philosophical inquiry is to discern the attraction to  McCandless and other young men (including Krakauer, in his youth) in  abandoning comfortable lives and living in the wilderness at great personal  risk.  The mystery is unraveling just what happened to McCandless from when  he graduated from Emory University in 1990 and disappeared until when his  decomposed body was found in late 1992, in Alaska.  Krakauer is a dogged  sleuth, who has succeeded in tracing McCandless' path across the nation,  into Mexico, and finally to Alaska and his final days.  Krakauer is also a  very gifted writer in weaving together both his specific story (McCandless'  journey) and the larger questions of what drives so many young men to  extreme personal odysseys.	1998-11-01

This novel,  while starting slowly, becomes a fine &quot;who-done-it&quot; involving the  investigation of an eighteen-year-old murder, which someone apparently will  go to any lengths (even more murder) to keep secret.  Maron does what a  writer of her genre should do -- keeps the plot moving, both surprising and  satisfying the reader at the end with the inexorability of her final  solution.  Maron's prose is not great, but it is not awful and  cliche-ridden either.  The phrase from the Uniform Commercial Code --  &quot;of fair average quality that would pass without exception in the  trade&quot; -- comes to mind.  Fortunately, her plot and characters are  well above average, making this an enjoyable read	1998-11-01

Modern materials science, of course, is focused much more on atomic and  sub-atomic levels, and Amato does a good job describing the state of the  art today.

The first nights of our honeymoon were taken  up with the World Series (luckily for her, the winning team swept the  series).  I thus consider myself a sports fan (I am obviously a reader).   Accordingly, I was delighted to receive for a recent birthday Robert K.  Adair's The Physics of Baseball.  The book itself, however, did not quite  meet expectations.  I encountered two key problems.  First, Adair writes in  the dry, passive-voice-laden prose of the scientist lacking a good editor.   Second, much of the scientific analysis was simply beyond me.  What I  enjoyed -- and found useful -- were the qualitative discriptions of the  game: how and why curveballs curve; how far a batted ball can be hit; the  differences between metal and wood bats.  While I could not follow each  step of his scientific description, the general, non-technical account  which he also gave was clear and persuasive.  From henceforth, I will watch  the game somewhat differently.	1998-11-01

Everest Disaster	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A winter adventure gratefully read in a warm room	Taken so by Krakauer's subsequent Into the Wild, I turned almost  immediately to his 1997 bestseller, Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of  the Mt. Everest Disaster.  In 1996, Krakauer was one of a twelve-person  guided team climbing Mt. Everest, five of whom died and one of whom lost  his hand to frostbite.  Krackauer's book answers three basic questions.   First, what happened to the party. This is not easy of resolution, as the  climbers and their guides become separated from each other in a driving  blizzard, without adequate radio communication, and with oxygen supplies  depleted.  Second, he asks what Everest was really like for the climbers.   The tale of personal courage, sacrifice, and unbelievable adversity is  absolutely riveting.  Certainly, this couch potato would never find himself  above 26,000 feet outside of an airplane!  Finally, he asks why he and  other adventurous spirits undertake such an insane quest at all (In many  respects, this is the same question he asks in his account of Chris  McCandless). The famous answer, &quot;because it's there,&quot; remains in  many respects the best explanation.  The story he tells of heroism and  sacrifice, loss and triage (several times, the choice is made to leave  dying -- but not yet dead -- climbers behind to save those still able to  walk), excitement and absolute terror is nothing less than compelling.  I  am most grateful, however, to read this grim book in a warm room, by  electric light, and after a good meal.	1998-11-01

Are the things we see in a museum &quot;the  truth&quot;, and how did they come to be so?  These questions and others  fill Lawrence Weschler's marvelous extended essay, Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of  Wonder.  Weschler takes as his jumping-off point the very real &quot;Museum  of Jurassic Technology,&quot; privately owned and operated in Los Angeles  by David Wilson. In this book, Wechsler tells how European museums began as  private collections of &quot;wonder-ful&quot; objects, with the focus less  on whether the object was &quot;true&quot; than whether it evoked  amazement.  Many of the objects in Wilson's &quot;Museum&quot; appear real,  and are described in the dry, precise prose known to museum viewers around  the world.  But they are not real. Or are they? This short (168 pages, with  endnotes) book examines both the &quot;wonders&quot; of Wilson's storefront  museum and the even more astounding wonders of the real world in gifted and  sprightly prose.

In this fictional invention, set in 1939, Vidal  imagines a Smithsonian where the exhibits come to life each day at closing  time, and where the museum staff is working with the exhibit characters and  real-life scientists, such as Oppenheimer and Einstein, to develop the  atomic bomb.  Into all this steps T., a teenage boy from St. Alban's School  who has absentmindedly scribbled the key equation for the bomb in the  margins of his algebra final.    When the exhibits come to life, T.  joins them in their time.  Thus, his first after-hours wandering finds him  in an old west exhibit, where he is nearly roasted alive by a group of  native americans (The woman who rescues him, who, it turns out, is Mrs.  Grover Cleveland, calls him &quot;Veal&quot; for the remainder of the  story). In the course of his work, T. discovers a means successfully to  time-travel. (A previous, unsuccessful, attempt at time travel by  Smithsonian staff rescued Lincoln from Ford's Theatre the moment he was  struck with the bullet, with the result that a slightly addled Lincoln now  presides in the bowels of the musuem as curator of ceramics). T. takes on  himself to alter events so that the world wars do not happen; he prevents  wars in Europe, but succeeds in moving Pearl Harbor forward by two years.   As always, Vidal is incapable of writing a dull sentence, and this short  (260 pgs.) novel marvelously combines great humor, clever conundrums, and  serious questions. Vidal has no sacred cows, so some part of his  impressions of historical figures and events is sure to offend any reader.   Very enjoyable!	1998-11-01

Todd's story features a dogged detective, a brutal killing, numerous suspects, and suspect witnesses.  It is also clean (no sex, no foul  language).  An added plus is the detective's own battle with shell shock  following World War I, including an ongoing dialogue with his personal  demon, Hamish, a deserting soldier he was forced to execute on the  battlefield.  Todd writes extremely well; his prose is clear, descriptive,  fresh, wholly lacking cliche.  His characters (especially Rutledge, the  detective) are well-drawn, believable.  The story itself is well plotted,  leaving the reader in doubt until the denouement in the final pages.    Wills is Todd's first novel; I look forward to his next!	1998-10-29

Like Purple America, Moody compresses his entire narrative  into one 24-hour period, and takes as his subject suburbanites in crisis.   In this novel, unerringly capturing the zeitgeist of 1973, Moody tells of  marital infidelity, youthful sexual exploration, spouse-swapping (one of  the best scenes is a &quot;key&quot; party, where the married couples place  their housekeys in a bowl, and the women later draw keys and go home with  whichever men to whom the keys belong), and senseless tragedy when a  teenager is electricuted during the storm.   Moody once again demonstrates  his skill as a writer: his prose is never less than interesting, and is  often spell-binding both in its language and story.  (I understand that The  Ice Storm has been made into a movie, and I am curious as to how Moody  would translate into film.  A trip to the video store is in order).	1998-10-29

Demos tells the story of an Indian raid of 1704, in Deerfield,  Massachusetts, and its aftermath.  In the raid, prominent minister John  Williams, his family, and many others are taken captive and transported to  Quebec, near Montreal.  Some die in transit; many others are returned or  &quot;redeemed&quot; to their homes.  Williams' daughter, Eunice, remains  &quot;unredeemed&quot;, a convert to Catholicism and a new way of life, now  married to a member of the capturing tribe.   Demos does a marvelous job  in reading and explicating the meager original sources which survive, and  applying a judicious historical imagination to reconstruct this story, both  in the larger context of time and place and the smaller context of the  Williams family.  As a resident of Northern New York, close to both Quebec  and the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation, this story has significant  local interest for me. Despite these attributes, however, I found the book  often lost my interest, I think because Demos tries too hard to be  writerly, with his narrative devices (ellipsis, enjambment, etc.) getting  in the way of the story. For this reason, I must qualify my recommendation,  at least for this general reader.  I must say, however, that my wife,  Carol, loved this book, stayed up late reading it, and enthused about it  for weeks after a late night conclusion.  Other critics also have been very  enthusiastic.	1998-10-29

Westlake's 1997 novel The Ax, shelved in the &quot;Mystery&quot; section of my local library, is a sterling example of black humor. (I am reminded of the movie Heathers of a few years ago.)  Westlake's premise is  simple: Burke Devore, a middle-aged paper company middle manager, has  gotten &quot;the ax&quot; from his employer after years of devoted service.   He can't find a job, largely because there are so many other newly  unemployed middle managers looking for work.  Westlake decides the only way  he can find work is to kill -- literally -- his competition.  I won't spoil  the plot or ending by telling you how he does this, or whether he finds  work. I will say that Westlake writes a funny, shocking, sad, and  believable story -- all in the first person as Burke exorcises his demons  and blows away his competition -- which kept me up late on a work-night to  finish.  Burke -- and Westlake -- ask the larger question of why our  society is so keen on discarding its most productive members (Burke was  clearly very good at what he did for a living) in pursuit of shareholder  profit.	1998-10-29

All of the events in this book take place during one horrible evening, and include spousal abandonment, attempted euthanasia, kinky sex,  drunken combat (and combative drunkenness), return home, and filial love  (and duty).  Despite the short time frame involved, the plot is not easy to  summarize.  The main character, Dexter (&quot;Hex&quot;) Raitliffe, has  returned home to care for his almost totally paralyzed (but mentally sharp)  mother, Billie, who herself has been abandoned by her husband.  Billie  wants nothing more than to die, but her paralysis makes suicide impossible.   Hence her plea to Hex to do the deed.  Hex, enraged over Billie's  abandonment, sets out to find (and punish?) the husband who abandoned  Billie, in a night filled with peril and unexpected surprise.    Moody  is a daring writer.  While told in the third person, each chapter assumes  the point of view of a different character.  Moody's sentences range from  fragments to periods which would make Cicero swoon (the second sentence in  the book is more than four pages long). In a lesser writer's hands, these  devices would seem forced, or simply fail.  Moody holds it all together,  and creates a breathtaking novel.  This book requires patience and careful  attention, but rewards both greatly.	1998-10-29

Taking the region that is now the Adirondack Park from the first arrival of whites through the  present, Schneider skillfully weaves together both present and past.  For  example, his chapter &quot;The Prince of Otter China&quot; tells about fur  trapping today, and introduces the reader to several living  &quot;characters.&quot;  Neighboring chapters then recount the history of  trapping in the Park.  Other groupings of chapters do likewise for  lumbering, wilderness guiding, and mining.  One &quot;chapter&quot; of the  Adirondacks which he unfortunately slights are Dr. Trudeau and the  tuberculosis &quot;cure cottages&quot; in and around Saranac Lake.  This  small quibble aside, I recommend this book to readers -- both New Yorkers  /Adirondackers and general readers -- who want to learn more both about a  specific, fascinating place and time and the idea of  the American  &quot;wilderness&quot; in general.	1998-10-29

Dickensian in the naming of places (the book is set in Hardborough, which it certainly is) and some characters, but not in length (only 123 pgs), Lively tells the story of a middle-aged widow who invests her small inheritence in a bookstore, the only such enterprise in her new hometown.  In so doing, she makes a few enemies, and is at last forced to succumb to the small-minded pettiness that rural communities can foster.  This is a sad book, and it makes one grieve for how mean people can be when they wish.  That said, it is an excellent novel, and ample food for thought	1998-10-26

Throughout her life, both in  her own household and later through her practice, she encounters situations  where unfair or bigoted judges control case outcome, where money conquers  justice, and where the law finally just wears litigants down.  In one  particularly telling passage, a senior, very compasionate, lawyer explains  why a case should be tried before a jury, rather than a judge alone:<br />  &quot;A bench trial! That would be worse. [T]he face that leans over the  bench, swaddled in black rayon, is not Solomon's It's a lawyer's. A lawyer  dressed up in a black costume.  And what kind of judge would we get?  How  much will he know about people?  Is he stupid? Prejudiced? Failure of  imagination is the heart of the law.&quot;<br /> The last sentence -- about  failure of the imagination being the law's lifeblood -- really gives one  pause.  In many respects, I cannot disagree, at least as the system often  works.  In the end, Melanie first becomes aware of then involved in a  widespread plan of civil disobedience, a group of persons who, having  concluded that the courts cannot protect themselves or their children from  violent abuse, must take the law in their own hands.  Sharp writes with  great passion and vision, and draws a cast of believable and sympathetic  characters.  I suspect any reader will finish the book either agreeing with  her point of view (I did) or throwing the novel aside in disgust.  I  recommend this novel very highly.	1998-10-26

Not at Darcy Frey, who writes a great book, but at the combined effects of wretched public schools, which pass along students able neither to read, write nor do sums; and at the NCAA's patronizing and exploitative treatment of &quot;student&quot; atheletes.  &quot;Last Shot&quot; tells of four star black basketball players on the Lincoln High School (Coney Island) team.  Despite horrible poverty, housing projects overrun by drugs and violence, ans a school system which cannot keep them safe (let alone educate), these young men are good kids.  They are kept alive, and their hopes fed, by a combination of (1) amazing basketball skills; (2) a coach and mentors who believe in them; and (3) the dream of a NCAA Division I scholarship leading into the big time.  Unfortunately, only one makes it, and he just barely.  The other three cannot meet the Proposition 48 requirement of 700 SAT scores (even though their high school grades are good), and lose their shot at a Division I scholarship.<br />  Juxtaposed against these hopeful young men, who do everything that is asked of them but are finally betrayed by abysmal schooling, are the Division I recruiters, many of them well-known coaches.  They give new meaning to the word &quot;smarmy.&quot;  They are corrupted by the system.   Darcy's title &quot;Last Shot&quot; has a (quite intentional) double meaning.  He refers first to the excitement of a well-played game, when victor and vanquished hang in the balance.  More troubling, he acknowledges that, for each of these boys, the chance to escape the ghetto through a basketball scholarship has become his &quot;last shot&quot; at a successful (or safe) life.  To mix metaphors, what angers me about the situation Frey describes -- in fact makes me so mad I will have trouble watching the NCAA Tournament this year -- is that these young men have received a raw deal.  It's not right!	1998-05-06

Donald Westlake's 1997 novel The Ax, shelved in the &quot;mystery&quot; section of my local library, is a sterling example of black humor. (I am reminded of the movie &quot;Heathers&quot; of a few years ago).  The premise is simple: Burke Devore, a middle-aged paper company middle manager, has gotten &quot;the ax&quot; from his employer after years of devoted service.  He can't find a job, largely because there are so many other newly unemployed middle managers looking for work.  Devore decides the only way he can find employment is to kill -- literally -- his competition.  I won't spoil the plot or ending by telling how he does this, or whether he finds work.  I will say that Westlake writes a funny, shocking, sad, and believable story -- all in the first person as Burke exorcises his demons and blows away the competition -- which kept me up late on a work-night to finish.  Burke -- and Westlake -- ask the larger question of why our society is so keen on discarding its most productive members (Burke was clearly very good at what he did for a living) in pursuit of shareholder profits.	1998-05-06
US	52543421	R9L4ZST9LY9HO	0679781382	999618850	Asylum	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A psychological thriller	This is a spooky novel.  The narrator, a psychiatrist, recounts the sudden romance between Stella, wife of another psychiatrist, and Edgar, a sculptor confined to a mental hospital after decapitating his wife. The contrast between the narrator's tone -- cool, analytical, scientific, writing about &quot;the catastrophic love affair characterized by sexual obsession&quot; -- and the torrid and potentially gruesome relationship between Stella and Edgar is striking. Also, by using the psychiatrist -- who is therapist to both Edgar and Stella -- as narrator, McGrath succesfully combines a first person narrator with the omniscience usually reserved for the third person point of view.  This is a very effective literary device.  McGrath also succeeds in sustaining plot, interest, and narrative drive well after Stella is &quot;rescued&quot; from Edgar (this happens fairly early in the book), through Stella's own unexpected psychosis, and to the suprising ending.  This is a cool and soboring study of mental illness.	1998-05-06

Richard and his mother are one half of their former family of four.  Dad and Richard's older brother move to California, and out of Richard's life.  Richard, in somewhat of a reversal of usual parent-child relations, attempts to shepherd (and shield) his mother through the ruthless New York art scene.  In the process, Richard seems to lose his youth, and finds himself a college graduate standing up a wonderful girlfriend so that he may again be his mother's protector. As it turns out, mom neither needs nor wants &quot;parenting&quot; by her son; she needs, however, a confidante and friend as she struggles in the art world (which, it appears, is just as mercenary and cold as any corporate culture).  Richard simply needs to het on with his life, but confuses his fear of doing so with his mistaken beliefs that his mother still &quot;needs&quot; him.  Lipsky captures the language and nuance of the relationships in the book perfectly.  Each character, and each scene, reads absolutely true to life.  I have a clear visual image of the individuals in this novel, and the scens in which they are placed (Lipsky is less interested in describing the works of the various artists).  The ending, also, is deeply satisfying.	1998-05-05
US	52543421	R7SI8F3ZTDFL3	0679766626	574131654	Last Orders	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Did not meet high expectations	Graham Swift's novel Last Orders has a marvelous premise: a group of elderly gentlemen -- all veterans of the Second World War -- travel from London to scatter in the sea the ashes of a recently deceased comrade.  The dearly departed's son, a car dealer, is also with them.  On the way, they reflect on their lives, wives, triumphs and disappointments.  At one point, two of the men get into a fight.  All of this is meant to be both funny (it is) and poignant (it is, sometimes)  <br />Swift's novel has reveived marvelous reviews, so I started with great anticipation after it became available at our local library.  I must disagree with the universal critical acclaim.  To me, Swift just misses in many of his scenes (his characters, in contrast, are jems).  As I read, I kept thinking, &quot;this is supposed to be a wonderful book, yet my mind keeps wandering. What's wrong with me?&quot;  After reading some of the other Amazon.com reader comments, I must conclude that the flaw is Swift's.	1998-05-05

This book is a fine example of petite histoire, the account of particular households and villages, set in the larger context of early colonial New England.  Demos tells the story of an Indian raid in 1704, in Deerfield, Massachusetts, and its aftermath.  In the raid, prominent minister John Williams, his family, and many others are taken captive and transported to Quebec, near Montreal.  Some die in transit; many others are returned or &quot;redeemed&quot; to their homes.  Williams' daughter, Eunice, remains &quot;unredeemed&quot;, a convert to Catholicism and a new way of life, now married to a member of the capturing tribe.  Demos does a marvelous job in reading and explicating the meager original sources which survive, and applying a judicious historical imagination to reconstruct the story, both in the larger context of time and place and the smaller context of the Williams family.  As a resident of Northern New York, living close both to Quebec and the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation, I found significant significant local interest in the book. Nonetheless, I found my interest often wandered, I think because Demos tried too hard to be writerly, with the result that his narrative devices (ellipsis, enjambment, etc.) getting in the way of the story.  For this reason, I have qualified my recommendation.  I must say, however, that my wife loved the book, stayed up late reading it, and enthused about it for weeks after a late night conclusion.	1998-05-05

Pierre Brossard, in his eighth decade, is on the run both from the French police and Zionist groups who want to kill him.  Brossard unquestionably is a war criminal (he ordered 14 Jews shot and killeb decause of their religion), but one who remains unrepentant in his hatreds and bigotry.  The reader is given little reason to sympathize with him, other than that he has been hounded for so many years.  A secret group, apparently Zionist, seeks to have Brossard killed and a &quot;statement&quot; pinned to his body recounting his fifty-year-old crime.  In self-defense, Brossard shoots and kills two would-be assassins.  The investigating judge wants to have him arrested and brought to trial, but is in a race with the would-be killers to find him.  Convervative anti-Vatican groups in the Catholic Church hide him as he seeks asylum from place to place in France.  I will not spoil the ending by disclosing who finds Brossard first.  Suffice to say that the reader is sharply torn between wishing &quot;rough&quot; but final justice for Brossard, and wishing him brought to trial (I never hoped for his escape from everyone). Moore's story sharply poses the questions of whether justice for war crime a half-century ago may ever be pardoned, or whether mercy or forgiveness may finally be appropriate (even when the evil-doer never repents of his beliefs).  He leaves the answer to each reader.	1998-05-02
US	52543421	R23YUV7FGPNZFD	0679742441	138945486	How We Die: Reflections of Life's Final Chapter, New Edition	Books	5	24	25	N	N	An important and sobering work about a difficult subject	This book by physician Sherwin B. Nuland is both important and sobering.  In the first half, Nuland tels from a physician's eye (but with laymen's language) what happens when a person dies from cardiac failure, cancer, &quot;old age&quot;, and other maladies.  This sets up the two-part argument of the second half: (1) that death is a reality that must be acknowledged and squarely faced; and (2) that much &quot;critical&quot; care given to the terminally ill is the product of the physician's intellectual battle with disease (he names the diagnostician's challenge &quot;The Riddle&quot;) and emotional reasoning on the part of both patient and family.  His point  -- and he makes it extremely well -- is that the dying and their families, while faced with certain grim realities, have choices concerning their final days, and some choices (both premature suicide as advocated by The Hemlock Society, and heroic efforts to prolong life) do little good and great harm.       As I read this book, I thought a lot about my aging mother, now in good health, and the wrenching difficulties her final days (or years) will likely bring.  Will she (and her family) have the courage to say to the doctors &quot;no more&quot;, when the young oncologist or cardiac specialist recommends as a last resort a &quot;promising&quot; but excruciating course of treatment?  What if her illness/disease robs her of the powers of reason and decision-making?  Those in the &quot;healing&quot; professions should read this book, as well as those -- and I suppose that means all of us -- with elderly or ill family or loved ones.  While the subject matter is depressing, Nuland's final arguments are not.  Also, my goodness, can this man write!	1998-05-02

Set in Portugal in 1938, Tabucchi's tale, originally written in Italian, is the story of an overweight, fading, and ill newspaper reporter now editing the culture page of a mediocre Lisbon newspaper who befriends, and then helps, a young writer with unacceptable political views.  Pereira steadfastly tries to avoid any political involvement whatsoever, but the nature of the coming Nazi state makes neutrality impossible.  Pereira must choose, and this choice involves either betrayal of his young comrade or his own political suicide.  I will not disclose how or why Pereira exercises his option.  Read this book and find out!	1998-05-02
