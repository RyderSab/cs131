Virtually everyone is familiar with Anne Boleyn, the first wife of Henry VIII to be decapitated.  However, few people are familiar with her sister, Mary Boleyn.  The novel is based on historical events, but is historical fiction.  It is a brilliantly imagined work that delves into the darker side of the Boleyn family and their quest for power at all costs.  <BR> <BR>Philippa Gregory is a gifted story-teller with a flourishing imagination.  I devoured this 600-odd page novel in a matter of hours.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone curious about this time period.<br />Her writing is fulfilling, keeping you guessing at every turn.  It is amazing that she is able to keep the reader so intrigued when one can be fairly certain how events will unfold.  (But you may be surprised!)<br />Pick this novel up and you will not be disappointed.  Enjoy!	2003-01-30

However, once the hype turned into endless praise from friends in my book clubs, I knew I had to pick this one up.<br />Haven Kimmel's memoir of growing up in Indiana is a pleasant, intriguing read.  Her use of lyrical description, at once sounds like a child's description, and is entirely beautiful.  Ms. Kimmel's memoir evokes feelings of sheer happiness.<br />While complex enough, when examined closely, it is also a truly simple and enjoyable read.  It doesn't have complex tragedies, depressing overtones.  It is a simple memoir of real life growing up in the Midwest. <br />The characters will warm your heart, leave you ducking behind bushes, or misty-eyed, and they will all be real.  It is hard to think that Ms. Kimmel wasn't jotting down notes on her thoughts, like a journalist, as her life carried on, because of the detail of every circumstance.<br />This novel will not dissappoint.  I recommend picking it up as soon as you get the chance.  It is a heart-warming, enjoyable read and lives up to its hype.<br />Enjoy!<BR>20 Nov 2002	2002-11-20

With this fourth installment of our young wizard friend, JK Rowling has done it right again.  Ms Rowling whisks us back to Hogwart's for Harry's fourth year.  But first, it is to the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasleys.

US	52789622	R1W8GDGIYVXS9G	0060096195	825975444	The Boy Next Door	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Slightly disappointed.	As a fan of Meg Cabot, author of The Princess Diaries, I was ecstatic when I found this book.  From the same author, though under the name Meggin rather than Meg, this book is touted as a story for the older girl.  The Princess Diaries was cute, so I figured I would give this one a try. <br />While the book is cute, it is little more than that.  The plot is interesting as well, but the format of the book was limiting as was, I believe, Ms.Cabot's status as a YA author.  The writing is somewhat unbelievable almost as if she were worried about offending younger viewers.  At times, I felt I was reading a book that was written by an adolescent as to what they might think being a young woman would be like.  All in all it is a bit trite. <br />The format also has issues, because it is written as a series of Emails, and it is often difficult to follow which character wrote the Email and when it was sent.  It was often a fractured story as well, seeing as it is not often that every detail in someone's life is sent over Email.<br />The idea for the story was well-intended, but it seems that it could have been executed in a better fashion.  I hope to find other adult novels by Ms. Cabot that are more succesful.  You still may enjoy this one, though, simply because the plot is adorable.<br />14 Nov 2002	2002-11-14
US	52789622	R1Q6ZEJ2N2L0UP	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Incredible work.	I must admit, I had no intention of reading this book when I discovered the subject matter.  I am very sensitive to issues of this nature, and didn't think that I could deal with it.  However, several members of a reading group I belong to raved about it.  They praised it as a deeply moving spiritual novel.  So, I decided to give The Lovely Bones a chance.<br />I couldn't be more glad that I did. The Lovely Bones follows the spiritual journey of a girl, a family and a community after a deep loss. The catch is that the story is written from the perspective of the murdered young girl. While the first chapter was difficult to read, the mood is softened by the soul of the girl. Her easiness and frankness with the subject matter make it readable. <br />This is only where the journey begins, though. Sebold has created a novel that is emotionally powerful and gripping. Her ability to mold and create characters is both eerie and comforting. Slowly, you will recognize growth and character development. The introduction of these qualities is so subtle, it is realistic, almost as though you are really meeting someone and getting to know them in reality.<br />Sebold has created a work of art with this novel. While the subject matter is intense, it is tastefully presented and flawlessly explored. Her exquisite talent is showcased by this beauty of a story. Enjoy<br />10/15/02	2002-10-15

I did not know why until I finally picked up the story.  <br />84, Charing Cross Road is a delightfully plain (and true) story about a woman in New York who orders books from a regular old bookshop in London.  While the woman could seek out an address in London to purchase her books, she chooses to remain loyal to Marks & Co. of London.  The letters encompass a near 20 year span and each one is more brilliant than the next.<br />The charm and wit of this love affair between Ms Helene Hanff and the bookshop staff, and their books, is undeniable.  The book is short and sweet, enjoyable and just wonderful.  Tragically, being that it is from true life, it teaches an important moral.  <br />If you are ever in London, you will never pass 84, Charing Cross Road with the same feeling.

Having read Mr Maybe and Babyville already by Jane Green, and thoroughly loving them I must admit I was a bit disappointed by this one.  This book was funny and moving at times; but it was overly unrealistic and fantastical in my opinion.  <br />The beauty of Green's books is her ability to make light of normal situations and breathe life into her characters.  Jemima J's characters are thoroughly developed but they are in unrealistic scenarios.  Something about this book just didn't click for me. <br />Certainly, the book was one of Green's earlier works so that may have something to do with it. This book is, of course, much better than many chick lit books out there, as Green always writes a story with feeling, it just isn't one of Green's better books.  <br />Jane Green has an absolute flair for fiction and comedy-- she sets up hilarious scenarios and wonderful action.  Her unpredictablity brings life into a story that would otherwise be a bit mundane.  Enjoy this one, it is not Green's best, but it is a great read nonetheless!	2002-09-30

Russophiles will enjoy this novel--- those not so interested in Russia and its people might not find it as interesting.   The novel is well-written, albeit a bit vague.  I think the biggest problem I had with the novel was the vagueness of the main character, Daniel.  <br />The character seemed slightly unreal, which is odd, since the novel is supposed to be semi-autobiographical.  His lack of self-awareness, and drive was just depressing.  It seemed like he had no thoughts on what was going on in his life.  Perhaps that is the character the author wished to portray, but I found his indifference irritating.  It, in fact, made the novel a bit difficult to read.<br />The insights into the Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia were the most interesting to me.  Viewing this nation from the perspective of an American was certainly interesting.  I will be visiting Russia shortly, and it will be interesting to compare Daniel's visions with my own. <br />Leaving Katya is a quick read, and the author characterizes Katya well, while she is not the main focus of the novel.  If the author were as clear with Daniel's character, perhaps I would have given it a 5 star rating.  <br />Overall, I found it an enjoyable, quick read.  I read it in about a day, and found it to be interesting, captivating at some points, and overall a good read.  <br />6/13/02	2002-06-13

They have a pretty simple life, enjoying themselves just as any other singles in their early thirties.  But, things change, and something amongst this group of friends sparks this change. <br />The way the four react and bond with one another, how they support one another, and how they live, is a beautiful vision of what friendship should be like.  Their friendship is a deep, beautiful one, and its wonders are made very clear by Keyes.  Her ability to write human reaction, characterizations and amazing situations is highlighted by Last Chance Saloon.<br />Anyone who needs a pick-me-up, easy-to-read book with some meaning will enjoy Last Chance Saloon.

The Nanny Diaries is more than just a look into the world of nannying.  This insightful book gives perspective into what is really going on in the elite world of Prada, Gucci, and trophy wives.  Ever wonder how heartless people are made?  The Nanny Diaries may have found the answer.<br />An intriguing read, The Nanny Diaries will have you laughing-out-loud, filled with rage, and crying---sometimes all at once.  <br />The relationship that grows between Nanny and her charge, Grayer, is truly commendable.  Nanny's patience and strength are admirable.  As a young woman, about the same age, I respect Nanny's character and ability.  Her mothering skills far outweigh those of Grayer's own mother.<br />The Nanny Diaries is a tale of companionship, love, bonds and courage.  You will be shocked at the self-centeredness of some characters, and overwhelmed by the selflessness of others.  Enjoy this read, it promises to fill you with many emotions.  <br />At first, I had a bit of a problem with the lack of character names, but once you get past that, the book is truly wonderful.

While I must admit, it was difficult to grasp at first, once the prose captured my attention, there was no putting this book down.  One understands Hemingway's gift when reading this book.  It is filled with such beautiful language, and lyrical descriptions that sweep you from the heart of Paris to the mountains of Spain.  <br />Hemingway's first published work describes the ex-pat lifestyle in Paris exceedingly well.  Having lived very near to where Jake, the main character lived, I could identify with his vivid descriptions he paints very well.  His foray into Spain with his fellow ex-pats is also very vivid.<br />Hemingway's descriptions are unmatched.  While some may not particularly like his writing style, if you do, you are in for a treat.  <br />I feared that I would loathe this book as I had onced loathed another Hemingway, The Old Man and the Sea.  However, that was not the case.  The Sun Also Rises is a much more involved story, not quite as steeped in symbolism and weighted by lengthy descriptions.  <br />The Sun Also Rises is a fair balance of prose and description, settings and characters.  If you've read other Hemingway and were not certain whether or not you liked it, try The Sun Also Rises.  If you enjoy Hemingway, don't avoid this because it is his first novel, savor it.<br />5/20/02	2002-05-20

Her wit, and writing skills usually make for a fascinating read.  While Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married is definitely a good novel, of the Chick Lit variety, it is not an exceptional one.  <br />Where Rachel's Holiday boasted hilarity and excellent character development, Lucy Sullivan was a bit lacking.  Mind you, a bit lacking for Marian Keyes is better than your average Chick Lit book.  However, this novel was slightly better than an average chick lit book, making it a bit of a disappointment from Keyes.  <br />I still laughed out loud, and enjoyed reading Lucy Sullivan but it was a bit trite.  I found the characters were much more one-dimensional than in her later novels.  The plot was less sophisticated, more predictable and generally more chick lit-esque.<br />Keyes is a fantastic writer, and even this book is enjoyable, it's just not up to par.<br />Strangely enough, I would still recommend this book to first time Keyes readers.  Only to tell you that it gets even better after this.  If you started with Lucy Sullivan and follwed with her others, I think it would be a much better sequence--- you would notice the improvement in her writing since having written Lucy Sullivan. <br />So, don't let this review discourage you in any way from reading Keyes.  She is a talented writer, with a gift for prose and character development, this novel just does not accentuate those aspects well enough.   I have yet to read Last Chance Saloon, and Watermelon, but both Rachel's Holiday and Sushi for Beginners are both excellent.  I will be reading everything by Keyes that I can get my hands on.<br />Enjoy, and first time Keyes readers, if you find this too light and fluffy, don't be discouraged from reading Keyes, pick up Rachel's Holiday and you'll understand what all the fuss is about!<br />5/13/02	2002-05-13

In preparation for a trip to Ireland, I picked up Rachel's Holiday in order to read some contemporary Irish fiction.  I had previously read Sushi for Beginners, another Keyes novel and I was not extraordinarily impressed.  I was told Rachel's Holiday was a more profound novel, and I was not disappointed. <br />Through the depths of drug addiction and beyond, Keyes shows us the extraordinary talent she posseses in character development.  Where Sushi for Beginners is slightly lacking in character development, Rachel's Holiday is not.  Keyes forms a character that is unforgettable in Rachel.  Her incredible ability to create a setting without stating it bluntly is unsurpassed in chick lit particularly.  While many novels of this mode simply create a single-edged, hollow character, Keyes creates a person in Rachel's Holiday.<br />In a novel about friends, courage, addiction and recovery, Keyes explores the darker side of the chick lit genre.  Her novel doesn't gaily overlook the addictions and psychosis of her main character, she delves into the problems with conviction.  You will follow Rachel in all her delusions through many phases of her life.  <br />This coming of age story is one for the chick lit generation.  It is a beautiful novel, truly inspiring and filled with gifted prose.  You will laugh, you will cry, you will question, and you will love all in one novel--- don't pass this one up.<br />5/12/02	2002-05-12

A coming of age tale, with an entirely different setting-- this book will move you.<br />The nature of the Irish story is always mystery.  The Nature of Water and Air definitely follows this idea.  Clodagh is curious, she wants to understand her past, a past that is so secreted by her family.  McBride manages to take tragedy and interweave it with Catholic culture, Pagan ritual, and Irish legend.  The web created by this is an Irish story on all levels of Irish culture and history.  Each step delving further into each, until one realizes it is truly the nature of water and air that drive the Irish tale. <br />McBride has a gift for creating despair.  The prose she creates whisks you into a depressing, confusing life.  However, even in the darkest of times, Clodagh perseveres and wades through her life with a true strength of character.  <br />The Nature of Water and Air is truly a gift to be shared.  A brilliant first novel for McBride and truly a great read.  I look forward to reading many more by McBride.	2002-04-23

When I first picked up Slave to Fashion, I loathed the main character, Katie Castle immediately.  I could not stand her egotistical, deplorable attitude.  However, with this novel, things change. Katie learns the hard way to develop integrity and the way to a beautiful soul.<br />A bit weightier than the average Brit Chick book, it follows Katie Castle and her rise from her loathed hometown to Fashion Diva.  However, certain events disrupt her climb, and she learns what the meaning of humility is, as well as several other essential human qualities.  <br />If you are looking for the average Brit Chick quick escape, I wouldn't necessarily recommend Slave to Fashion.  It's definitely a very enjoyable read, but it's got much more depth than usual. <BR>Slave to Fashion is definitely worth the purchase, and, should not be skipped if you fear it is yet another formulaic Brit Chick romp.	2002-04-17

I had seen this book a number of times at different stores, and finally, I decided to purchase it. <br />So far, so good!  I really enjoy the style of this recipe organizer.  I have always wanted a good place to keep my recipes safe and organized.  <br />Not only is it perfect for organizing your recips according to type, it's got some helpful hints and some great quotes!<br />It is an adorable book, and would make an excellent gift, or wonderful addition to your own kitchen.	2002-03-28

Circle of Friends had long been a favorite movie of mine.  However, after reading the novel, I changed my point-of-view on the film.  The film pales in comparison with the magnitude of this novel.  <br />There is much more to the novel than the film ever lets on.  It is much more thorough, the characters are even more fully developed---generally, it's a masterpiece.  It quickly became one of my favorite books of all time after reading it.  <br />Binchy's talent for writing about Ireland and the Irish people is unmatched.  Her understanding of the Catholic faith, and the Catholic guilt that comes hand-in-hand with it is pure.  The novel is a wonderful exploration of young people in Ireland, and it is exceedingly successful.  The characters in this book will never leave my heart.  The sights of Ireland, have been ingrained in my mind.  The tales Binchy has woven to create this exquisite novel are unmatched.  Having traveled to Ireland, and experienced the culture and sights, I can say with first-hand experience that Maeve Binchy is accurate, and weaves a beautiful tale that anyone who loves Ireland will enjoy.	2002-03-28

Always seems to be some kind of curiosity emerging from it--- but none could possibly match the curiosity of The Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing Wind.  The Church was founded because the members of its community were seeking a wholesome, conservative group.  More conservative than the Southern Baptists, or the Pentecostal church, The Church of Fire and Brimstone is a breed of ultra-conservative Protestantism.  In a select and sequestered community, that is bound to cause some issue.  <br />Enter Ninah, a young woman in the community, born with the need to question and a strong will.  Complicate things by making her the founder of the church's granddaughter, and you've got cause for some trouble.  Enter into the warped world of the church.  Reynolds creates a setting so real you truly feel as though you are inside the compound. Reynolds captures her characters in a striking manner.  Each character is different, but you will form a bond of your own with them. <br />Enjoy this very well-written novel.  It is unconventional, saddening, uplifting, and so many things all at once.	2002-03-27

However, Edgehill does not disappoint with this fantastic novel-in fact her depiction of biblical times rivals that of Diamant's.<br />Travel back in time to the Old Testament, where we meet another fairly insignificant Biblical figure, Michal.  Edgehill gives Michal a story and depicts the life of women as it was in early Biblical times.  Your imagination will be thoroughly encourage and pleased by her stunning depiction of every aspect of a very different life. Edgehill shows many different sides of Queen Michal's King David.  Her ability to create readable prose for the context is fantastic.<br />Do not fear, Queenmaker, is not a formulated Biblical story rushed out by Edgehill in bandwagon fashion.  Queenmaker is a beautiful story, and a remarkable novel in its own right.	2002-03-21

From the onset of this tale I was enthralled.  It delves into a subject that has long been a mystery in the Roman Catholic Church.  Was a woman ever Pope?  <br />Woolfolk-Cross weaves a tale of a headstrong, intelligent young woman who will let no man stand in her way--- even if she has to conceal her true identity.  Joan is faced with many obstacles, but uses her womanly nature to her advantage.  Woolfolk-Cross paints a portrait that is difficult not to see.  The essence of the time period-one extremely difficult for women-is very clear.   <br />Joan is a woman blessed with strength, courage, and a lust for knowledge.  Her determination to be a strong and independent woman is encouraging and translates even to today's world. <br />Regardless of your religion, or your notion of religion this book is certain to appeal to you.  It is not a book strictly for the religious, it is far from that.  It is a tale of strength, which translates to all facets of life.  Woolfolk-Cross has written a masterpiece, and a highly-researched one at that.  Pope Joan exceeded my loftiest expectations.	2002-02-28

Before seeing the film, I decided to read the highly acclaimed novel by Alex Garland.  A book of adventure, societal interaction, and psychosis, The Beach will take you on a journey through the wilds of Thailand. The dream of Utopia is a common literary thread, combine that dream with a fantastic locale and you have The Beach.  This combination, is certain to provide with an entertaining read.  It's like the Lord of the Flies, combined with a really interesting travelogue.  The scenery is extremely well described... You can feel the warm sun on your brow, you can taste the fresh fish, you can smell the spice of life.  This adventurous tale was not done justice in the film.  In fact, the film butchers some of the most important themes.  The book is much deeper, and more thorough.  Some of the main themes, in fact were lost on the film.  For a great adventure, certain to warm a winter-weary soul, the Beach is a great read.  Warning: It can be a bit graphic.	2002-02-19

From the onset of this novel, one is intrigued by the realism of the narration.  No narrator is plagued with a God-like knowledge of their surroundings, they know only what they experience.  That is the key to the beauty of Fall on Your Knees.  <BR>Macdonald manages to create a dark world, focusing on the Piper family.  Her ability to immerse the reader in the experiences of this family is a gift.  When I began reading, however, I was not quite so enthralled with it.  I thought it was strange, a bit wordy, and confusing.  It was so intense and disturbing, however, that I was unable to set it aside.  So, I continued reading, and I am so glad I did.  It was only the end that made me fall in love with this book.  The ending sums up the book, and you begin to realize what everything you previously read meant.  It was a moment of realization when everything comes together.  You realize that every word that Macdonald uses has been chosen for a particular reason, nothing in this book, contrary to what it seems is haphazard.  At the end, I found myself wanting to go back and reread certain parts, knowing what I knew from the end of the book, to see what I had miss.  It was like a movie, that needed to be watched again knowing the `secret' and wanting to test the limits to see how well-written it was that certain subteleties that escaped the first time are blatant, important scenes, after all. This is one book that won't leave me for a long time.  It is so incredibly well-written, the world of the Pipers now exists somewhere inside of me, no matter how disturbing that may be.	2002-02-19

Having never read Pride and Prejudice, I was at a slight disadvantage when reading Pride, Prejudice and Jasmin Field.  However, that did not limit my ability to enjoy it.  It did spark my desire to read the original Pride and Prejudice.  Melissa Nathan's tale is well-written, and enjoyable, albeit a bit predictable.   The most enjoyable aspect of this quick read are the characters.  While they are a bit predictable, the strength of Jasmin Field is reassuring.  Her quick wit, and sharp tongue make for some very interesting scenes.  The book's characters apparently parallel those of Pride and Prejudice, and this is evident in the presentation of the play in the book. While it's not a very original piece, it was and enjoyable, quick, light read.  I will definitely be purchasing Pride and Prejudice now!	2002-02-19

Becky Bloomwood, the main character in the Shopaholic books is at it again.  She's successful, has a boyfriend, and manages to repeat the cycle of a true addict.  Join Becky on her adventure on a trip to Manhattan.  If you enjoy shopping at all, you'll drool at the different places she visits.  Becky's antics get her into some Bridget Jones-esque trouble, and the laugh factor is high.  You'll sympathize with Becky, you'll want to shake her, you'll cry with her, and you'll be proud of her in this successful sequel.  I don't think it's quite as good as the first, however, it's still a great book.  There is nothing better than shopping and reading about shopping, at least in my opinion, so this book rates well in my book.  If you enjoyed Confessions of  A Shopaholic, you'll be certain to enjoy this one!	2002-02-19

Set in England in a much different time and place, Slammerkin is a dark read.  Emma Donaghue does an excellent job placing us in England in the 18th Century, with all of its societal rules and roles.  We meet Mary, a young girl, and follow her, as she begins a descent into the darker side of old London.  Based on true personages from this time period, Donaghue captures characters that are true to life, mysterious, and surprising.  With each twist and turn, one wonders where the novel will go next.  Impulsive, and immature, Mary takes us on a dark adventure through the time period.  <BR>Her escapades are never-ending, and her character will stick by you, whether or not you'd like her to be there.  <BR>Exploring significant characters often ignored by history books, and those wishing to push certain unmentionable events under the rug, Slammerkin provides for an insightful and intriguing read. <BR>Although a very somber novel, it is very much worthwhile.  It sat on my shelf much too long, before being read.  Once I finally picked it up, I couldn't stop reading.  I was intrigued and at times disgusted, but glued to the book, nonetheless.  Enjoy!	2002-02-05

When I discovered it was the receiver the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, among other accolades, I determined that it must be an excellent read.  I found the novel well-written, and very creative, but somewhat difficult to discern.  The Shipping News is stylistically difficult.  I was compelled to continue reading to find out what would happen, to discover what the movie would be about.  It wasn't until the last chapter that the author allows for a dramatic climax.  There are interesting parts in the story, but it flowed poorly.  <BR>I enjoyed the novel, I would give it 3 and a half stars if that were an option, however, was not as pleased with it as I had expected to be.  It was certainly a work of art, compellingly executed, but the writing was not of a style that I particularly enjoy.   The author had difficulty capturing my imagination, and I found some difficulty in visualizing the events as they occurred.  Overall, I find the novel is worth the read.  I wouldn't rate it as a favorite, but it could be yours.	2002-01-28

With a new twist, this coming-of-age novel steals the genre for me.  Ann Brashares takes us on a magical ride with the Traveling Pants and the best friends who comprise the sisterhood.  Each girl experiences a different, new, aspect of life and their personality during their first summer apart in their lives.  With each page, you will become closer to these girls, as they grow and begin to understand the world, and themselves. <BR>The novel is brilliantly narrated, each girl developing a real human personality.  These characters are not the 2-D characters often found in novels of this genre.  Ann Brashares develops them so thoroughly, at least one of these girls rings incredibly true to my own adolescence.   <BR>Not only are they well-developed, and human, Brashares doesn't give them more wisdom than any other fifteen-year-olds would have.  The characters un-annoyingly live their lives as real teenagers, and delve into human emotions that all women have experienced at some point. <BR>If you are looking for a light read, with some underlying, and truly deeper characteristics, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is definitely one to invest in. Each girl will find her way into your heart, and possibly show you something you never knew was there.	2002-01-21

I didn't think I would be much interested in a romance novel based on time travel -- it just seemed way too implausible.  However, at the persistence of several friends from a book group, I gave this novel a try.  I am certainly grateful that I did.  Firstly, this is not merely a romance novel.  It involves a romance, to be sure, but this romance is not one you'd find again and again in your average Harlequin.  This is an original romance, which so completely describes love that I found myself better understanding love than I did at the onset of the novel.  When a novel has the capacity to make you understand something as vague as love, you know it is good.<BR>It is also filled with adventure, religion, and human conscience.  A historical novel rarely has the ability to make me understand things about my own presence, and yet, Outlander simply did.  I was unable to put this book down, as enraptured as I was by the compelling writing.  <BR>The character development is beyond any I have lately read.  Dianna Gabaldon has a true gift for understanding human emotion and translating it for the rest of us to understand. <BR>If you fear that the plot seems to be a bit too &quot;outlandish&quot; for you, still, give this one a try.  While certain aspects may be unbelievable, the reality is, this novel has so much truth to it, you will be amazed.  I was.	2001-12-10

I picked it up, based on the excellent reviews and for a book group.  However, I just could not get into the book.  <br />While I enjoyed the premise of the story, and thought it was clever, I did not enjoy Mapson's writing style.  I felt the characters were unrealistic and contrived.  I found myself forcing myself to continue reading where normally, I can't stop.

If you haven't read anything by Fielding, yet, you won't be disappointed by her writing.  She has a true knack for comedy, and a brilliant sense of telling things like they are.  <br />With Helen Fielding's works you know you won't miss out on an adventure.  Her work is a treat for the mind... Relax, and let Helen's magical storytelling bring you, first, into the celebrity of London, complete with the average sociopaths.  We meet Rosie Richardson, a young woman struggling to find herself, lost amidst the glitz and glamour of the London elite. <br />Fate causes her scheming to land her in the heart of Africa, doing what she was [surprisingly] meant to do.  Her plans lead her through tragedy and triumph, but all the while with Rosie learning her strengths as a woman. The characters are developed so brilliantly in this book, you will miss them the moment you put it down.  The evolution of Rosie Richardson is fantastic, she is so real, and brings heart to the plight of Africa.<br />This book glides perfectly along the line of comedy and tragedy.

Ellen's life is a sad twist of one tragedy to the next.  This is definitely not a light-hearted Southern novel.  It is a gritty, tough read, but it is so well done, it is worthwhile.  <br />You will be unable to put this book down, however difficult it may be to read.  <br />This book definitely deserves your attention, and at the discounted price [it] is selling it for, I would highly recommend it.	2001-10-17

Upon finding this book, I thought it would give me a bit of perspective from the Serbian point of view.  However, I was sorely mistaken.  It is yet another web of biased garbage produced by the media with a heavily Serbian overtone.  The book ignores the mass-murder committed by the Serbs in their own ethnic cleansing campaign.  Anyone who knows the accurate factual history of what the Serbs did during their ethnic cleansing campaign to the Croats, Bosnians and Kosovars knows that this book is unequivocally harmful.  The book presents evidence of Croatian wrongdoing in the war, but ignores the fact that the Serbs attacked a virtually unarmed and disorganized Croatian army.  At the onset of the war, there was a sanction on selling weapons to the countries that the Serbs were aggressing, while the Serbs were still able to get weapons.  This lead to the slaughter of many Croats and Bosnians.  While it is not a bad idea to explore another point of view when examining a history, it is imperative not to rely on extremely biased and unfair trash that is/was fed to the world by the Serbs, who controlled Yugoslav media until the breakup.  You are certain to get a very interesting point-of-view from this tale, but remember that it is just that, a biased, and disgusting fairy tale.	2001-10-17

Big Stone Gap promises to whisk you off your feet to the mountains of Virginia, to a place that is possibly the most comforting place on Earth.  This book, and this town, have a presence that you won't soon forget.  The characters are memorable, and by the time you're through you will miss each and every person you've been introduced to.  With each turn of the page, Trigiani draws you into the close-knit community of Big Stone Gap, with laughter, tears and surprises.  Far from one-dimensional, you learn about human nature, and aspects of a lifestyle that you are perhaps not familiar with.  As a 'feriner', just like Ave Maria in the story, I can relate on many levels with her sentiments.  Each character has some aspect to make you fall in love with them.  If you are looking for a light read, but with some substance, Trigiani's Big Stone Gap is perfect.  You won't forget these characters any time soon, and you will feel like they won't forget you either.	2001-10-16

As a woman, it touches me to my very core.  Slavenka Drakulic's honest portrayal of what some women suffered during the collapse of Yugoslavia is precise.  At times it is absolutely unbearable.  At times it is the most beautiful tale of human strength.  It is definitely something to read about things that happen outside of our own lives.  To look at these people and what they suffered is to take a step into a world that is entirely unfamiliar.  Finally, I was able to grasp the severity of such conflicts that were often a sidebar on the nightly news when I was still a girl.  The gravity of this book is devastating, but so forthright, it is impossible to stop reading.  If you want to gain some perspective on the sufferings that occurred not to long ago, and are possibly still occurring to this day in certain parts of the former Yugoslavia, S. will definitely give you that perspective.  Be prepared forever for an intense and graphic read.  It will disturb you, and at times comfort, however, you won't be able to erase the images that Slavenka Drakulic superbly illustrates.	2001-09-29

The Princess Diaries is the story of young Mia Thermopolis, whose life is turned upside down when she learns that she is heir to the throne of Genovia, a small European principality.  The book is great for teens, and fun for adults, too.  The book deals with lots of issues that teenagers face, and puts them into perspective with a morally strong character.  Mia Thermopolis is a wonderful girl, and her ideals are strong in the book.  With strength of character, Mia deals with the situation graciously, and much more eloquently than it is dealt with in the film.<br />The film undermines some of the most interesting issues addressed in the novel, but it is cute, too, nonetheless.  <br />If you are looking for a light summer read, The Princess Diaries is just that.  And, it has a little bit of substance too, that might even get the adults thinking.  <br />Purchase this one as it is a Mass Market Paperback, and worth the [money]. Enjoy!	2001-08-14

As a relatively young American, with little knowledge of the conflict in the Balkans, I decided to pick up a book that would give me an unbiased opinion on the conflict, so that I could form my own opinion.  I thought that a book with the title, &quot;Serbs and Croats: The Struggle in Yugoslavia&quot; would be such a book.  I was wrong.  While informative, the information does have a very strong slant.  This is probably due to the heavy influence the Serbs have on the media.  It is the same influence that led to our nation's ignorance of the Concentration camps set up in Serbia and Croatia during the war.  So, if you are looking for an interesting and quick read on the topic, this is a book to read, however, if you want an unbiased book, this is NOT the book to read.  I have also picked up Croatia: A History, which is surprisingly much less biased, and much more thorough.  I would recommend that book over Serbs and Croats, if you want something more substantial, and less biased.	2001-08-14

For the younger generation, it offers us a glimpse of something we've been told about, but can't truly grasp.  <br />World War II brought out the best in our nation.  We came together under a common cause and were more united than ever.  The young men and women of that generation, my age now and younger, were The Greatest Generation without a doubt.  <br />These amazing people have shared their stories with Mr. Brokaw, and it is just incredible to learn about the personal contributions that people made for the sake of our country.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants a greater appreciation for the sacrifices of previous generations.  This book will move you, and you will wholeheartedly have a new appreciation for these people.	2001-07-01

The blurb on the back cover sold it for me.  I wanted to read something fun, light and fast, and Tulip Fever was it for a great summer read.  <br />At the beginning, it opens with some interesting sexual exploits, but it quickly picks up and is difficult to put down.  <br />If you enjoy period novels, this is a great one.  Based in Holland [the Low Countries] during the 17th Century, it is an interesting glimpse into the tulip craze that rocked that country.  It does not have a heavy plot, but it will keep you guessing and engrossed until the end.  <br />It's no masterpiece, but it is enjoyable, interesting, and mysterious.  You will definitely fly through this one, and enjoy it along the way.	2001-06-30

Street maps, metro maps, museum prices, times, information on EVERYTHING.  <br />I left to study abroad in Paris last year, and spent lots of money on essentially useless guidebooks.

It offers hotels, restaurants, museums, and pictures of nearly everything, to boot.  <br />I guarantee that this guidebook will not let you down.  The Eyewitness guides are all you need, and all I will ever purchase in the future for my travel guidebook needs.<br />Enjoy Paris!  Bon Voyage.	2001-06-27
US	52789622	R2K1YWT5AQWZF	0345350499	627223385	The Mists of Avalon	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Perspective	When I first discovered The Mists of Avalon, I had very little interest in Arthurian legend.  I was very curious, however, to read this novel.  While it seemed a bit daunting, it ended up being a magnificent read.  It was so engrossing I would find myself lost for hours, zooming through hundreds of pages without even noticing the time going by.  <br />The Mists of Avalon brings to life a civilization shrouded in mystery.  Since very little is known on the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, Marion Zimmer Bradley decided to write the novel from a very fresh, and yet, plausible perspective.  Her wonderful tale of Arthurian life is told from the point of view of the women in the story, and often it is the women with the least-expected roles in traditional Arthurian legend who are the key characters. It also tells the perspective from that of the non-Christian one.  It is not your average novel, by any means.<br />While it is classified as a Science Fiction novel, it is not outlandish and completely unrealistic.  [While not completely realistic, either.] <br />The very least I can say about this novel is that it is a masterpiece.  Mists of Avalon is a comprehensive study of life in the time of the Arthurian legend.  If you enjoy novels of a different era, that completely sweep you out of your present situation, this is the book for you.  This novel is full of fantasy, legend, and intelligence.<br />This is my all-time favorite novel, and one I will read again and again.	2001-06-27

Stolen Lives is a masterpiece of a tragic variety.  It highlights the fall and rebirth of a powerful Moroccan family under the dictator King Hassan II.  This well-executed voyage though lives tragically stolen from innocent people is a harrowing dose of reality.  This work showcases the feeling of imprisonment in a way that I have never experienced before.  This book disturbingly shows the atrocity of living under a dictator and suffering his selfish wrath.  This family, devastatingly has everything torn from them, for the sins of their patriarch.  However, they manage to retain strength and courage as a family.  It is beautiful and heartbreaking all at once.  The strength of family and the will to be free are poignant in this remarkable read.  This book is especially wonderful for younger readers who have not experienced any semblance of true tragedy in their lives.  It gives a look into the real and unsheltered world that others have survived.	2001-06-21

As I began the second book in the good ol' Harry Potter series, I was worried as to whether or not I would enjoy it quite as much as the first.  I was not disappointed!<br />After becoming involved in a more intricate plot, I enjoyed the further character development of all of the characters.  Each successive Harry Potter book seems to grow up, one step more than the first, just like Harry, himself.<br />While Harry may not be the most brilliant wizard in Hogwart's [Hermione takes that award], he has the most heart.  This second installation in the series shows just how much heart Harry has! More secrets about Harry's past are unearthed in breathtaking magical episodes.<br />This second book will leave you guessing, much more than the first.  It has more questions, answers, and fun!<br />Harry Potter is a remarkable gift to the literary world, both children's and adult's.  I was a sceptic before I actually picked up JK Rowling's magnificent books, but now, I, too, am a huge Harry Potter fan.<br />If you enjoy reading, are looking for summer reading, or are just curious as to what all the hype is about, read Harry Potter.  Harry will bring out the kid in the adults, and activate the imaginations in children.  This book is the perfect summer reading, when it is too difficult to concentrate on anything but fun.<br />Enjoy!	2001-05-25

So, if you are looking to see and do everything California has to offer, this guide is for you.  <br />It includes hotel information and restaurants according to location.

At first, I had a difficult time becoming engaged in the story.  The story was not really something I enjoyed at the onset.  However, as the plot thickens, and the work unfolds, Tan develops a beautiful story filled with history and rich in character.  <br />Tan's descriptions of China and Liu LuLing are wonderfully rich.  Her mastery of the setting enfolds you in the story.  Reading this book sweeps you off to another place and another time.  I could taste her descriptions of food, feel her descriptions of pain, and envision myself in the settings she creates. <br />This tale is incredibly bold.  It deals with subjects that are realistic, and intriguing.  It also weaves in historical information in a very effective manner.  It is a poignant look into the world of a very interesting Chinese family. <br />The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the first few chapters.  The story set in China was so much more alive and interesting.  The rest of the story seemed a bit lackluster.  I understand why Tan chose to do this, but, I feel that there could have been more effective ways to address the past, present and future.  <br />If it were not for my online book club, I would have passed this book up.  It is not a book I would normally read, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  <br />All in all Tan presents a beautifully written story that is definitely worth the read.	2001-05-17

I keep going back to it to read about different aspects of not just Pearl Harbor, but World War II. <br />Since I am only 21 years old, it was difficult to grasp the human aspects of such an attack, but this book puts things into perspective.  <br />I will always keep this book, not only as an informative guide, but also as a reminder of America's Darkest Day.	2001-05-17

While some of the photography was beautiful, there were a couple of things that I disliked about the book.<br />The first was the fact that I felt like I was intruding.  It didn't seem that the people photographed had always consented. [Many Amish do not like to have their photographs taken, because of a Biblical passage.]  Some of them seemed like they had allowed the photographer in, but in some photos I just couldn't help feeling that something wasn't right.<br />The second was the layout.  I thought the book was very poorly layed out and could have been much more effective if it had been properly laid out.   There is a lot of interesting information held within the pages of this book, if you know where to look.  [It is difficult to find captions for pictures, etc.]<br />It is, however, an informative guide to the Amish.	2001-04-26

Not like most heros, Harry doesn't always win.  That doesn't mean that Harry won't come out ahead.<br />Harry's world at Hogwart's School of Magic is every kid's dream.  I had always been fascinated with magic as a child, and this book delves into that fascinating world filled.<br />I think that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will remain my favorite Harry Potter book if only because it is the book that brings such vivid description to things I had thought I had long ago locked away in my imagination.

The topic certainly had me intrigued when I sat down to read it. I was not disappointed.  After I read the first page I found it nearly impossible to put the book down.  I stayed up all night reading it.      I really enjoyed gaining a better understanding of a very misunderstood people.  The Amish were presented in a fair light, and, it was very interesting learning about them.  I had always thought that the Amish were like saints.  It was interesting, and reassuring to learn that they are people just like everyone else.  There are good Amish, bad Amish, happy, and sad, rich and poor.    The characters were very vivid, and I was intrigued by the way they stayed real.  This was a definite plus to the novel.      I am not usually one for courtroom thrillers, but this book was informative, exciting and EXTREMELY well written.      The strength of the family is highlighted in this book, and that is important to me.  It is a very realistic novel because of the issue of the role of the family.

It sounded, and looked, like it would be too depressing to read.  However, though many terrible things happen, through Frank's eyes, it is all readable.  This book is written so eloquently and with such fine execution that you wonder how Frank can recall so many emotions from his childhood.  McCourt captures the essence of childhood in an extraordinary manner.  Sometimes the descriptions were so true that I found myself brought to tears at childhood memories that I had forgotten.  While the subject matter isn't the easiest to deal with, the way McCourt writes the novel makes it palatable.  I don't know if I could have stuck with it under most circumstances.  However, McCourt is a pure genius, and there are even some quite comedic scenes in this masterpiece.  My recommendation: A must read.	2001-04-15

Another chapter in the life of Frank McCourt, 'Tis is intriguing, though not quite as succesful as its predecessor.  While the events in McCourt's life are still amazing, and wonderully told, the story isn't as complete as in Angela's Ashes.  While the tale isn't told in the same fantastic manner, if you enjoyed Angela's Ashes then you will find interest in 'Tis.  I read 'Tis much more quickly than Angela's Ashes, although, I think it is merely because I wasn't as intrigued.  In Angela's Ashes, the writing as well as the events in Frank's life kept me engrossed in every event.  However, in 'Tis, I was more concerned with the story than the writing itself. 'Tis is still an excellent novel. <br />I would recommend reading this book, but with the realisation that Angela's Ashes was hard to top.	2001-04-15

No matter what Roald Dahl novel you pick up, it is almost guaranteed to be a masterpiece. <br />Dahl intrigues children, with his characters, and their circumstances.  The BFG is no different.  I read this novel as a child, after  I had read the Charlie books, and Matilda, and this Roald Dahl work was just as great as the others. <br />If you have children, this is a must-read for them.  Dahl always offers some kind of lessons within his writing, and his prose is amazing.  Even as a child, I was unable to put this book down.	2001-04-14

I thought that this novel was well worth the read.<br />It was a quick, well-executed tale of a girl and her experiences in young love and in her young life.  I enjoyed the way the narrator believably grew up.  <br />It is often easy to forget the way we thought about things as teenagers, or as younger adults.  Through this book you can relive the memories.  While conflict isn't readily available in this novel, it is still captivating.<br />Jane is a great character that you will understand and love.  I would definitely recommend this book.	2001-04-14

As a real singleton young woman, I can truly appreciate Bridget Jones' humor, and, situation.  This book kept me up late at night in a giggle fest!  It is so easy to relate to Bridget and her trials and tribulations.  Her charm and wit are heart-warming, and incredibly readable.<br />Helen Fielding masters the portrayal of this young lady!  It is such a real and believable character that you begin to foget that she is just that-- a character. While, I suppose, some of her reactions are a bit outlandish, she acts on  every impulse we carry inside of us, whether more deeply, or more shallow.<br />Through all of her misfortunes and happiness her character is hilarious.  I found myself laughing out loud at many times. I can relate to Bridget Jones', and I am sure most other women can as well.  Men, if you want some insight into the female psyche, read this book!<br />Nicki	2001-04-14

It deals with issues that grip we, as people, from our adolesence through the rest of our lives.  The issues discussed in this tale are issues that one will remember for the rest of one's life.  <br />Lois Lowry's masterpiece is one of the most interesting tales that I have ever read, as a youth, and as a young adult.  The prose is fantastically written.  It is definitely interesting enough to keep both adults and young adults glued to the pages. <br />I will definitely read this book again and again.  I have recommended it to my younger sisters, and I will recommend it to my own children some day.  <br />If you are looking for something to read after Harry Potter, perhaps this might interest you.  I must admit, Harry Potter got my sisters to read, but this book captivated them in a way that I never saw Harry Potter do.  [Now, it's my turn to read Harry Potter!]<br />Read The Giver, you will not be disappointed!	2001-04-14

As a child, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the novel I read that sparked my interest in reading.  Roald Dahl is a superb author, brimming with imaginative tales that strike a passion for reading, in anyone who does read his stories.  <br />This tale, of a young, poor Charlie, chronicles his escapades in the Chocolate factory.  It is a book filled with hope, sadness, happiness, and moral lessons.  It does not sugar coat everything, though.  It lets the young readers know that life is not always fair.  This book is a must-read for children, and adults for that matter.  <br />As Roald Dahl's books are always great, this one is too!  ....	2001-04-14

Not merely by the title, but because of all of the great reviews it had received. <br />I read the back cover and was reluctant to start reading. <br />Once I opened the first page, though, the story spilled out in an uncontrollable rush.  I have never before read words that leapt off the page in such a way.  I would sit down to read just a bit, and read 50+ pages.  I ended up reading it very quickly.<br />It is such an intriguing story of hatred, crime, punishment, forgiveness, love, and jealousy.  I was engrossed in the story until the very last words of the novel.  [Literally!] <br />It is a learning experience, eye-opening, it gives clues to almost every personality imaginable.  The reader delves into the deepest thoughts of every character, and better understands human emotion better, from all different angles, and sometimes [extremely] different humans.	2001-04-11

This is a quick, engrossing read!  I enjoyed thoroughly, the fictitious journals of May Dodd.<br />Jim Fergus uses strong characters whom we come to love, pity, and hate.  The novel is extremely moving.  I spent an entire night, so enthralled, I was unable to put it down. <br />I felt like May was missing from my life when I had finished the novel.<br />Until this novel, the plight of Native Americans in the times of settlement, and now, were only a distant history.  This novel, though fictitious,  brought this plight closer to home.<br />I think that this novel is a must-read!  I will keep it forever in my library, and I think I will even read it again soon.	2001-04-07

Jane Eyre is an eloquently written, surprising, and captivating novel.  The beauty of this tale is sometimes overlooked because of the time period from which it hails.  However, one must not allow the restrains of the time period in which this novel was written restrict one from reading it.  For, not only does Jane defy the roles set for her by the society of her time, but this novel, written under a pseudonym by Charlotte Bronte defies the rules of a novel for its time.<br />The novel is revolutionary in its own singularly, and by what is captured on its pages.<br />This is a must-read for anyone.  A classic that is a necessary addition to every library.<br />This book is above any star-rating system.	2001-04-04

Though not a complete waste of time, this book was definitely more hype than substance.  I felt the novel lacked any real constructive qualities.  The narration was lacking, though the story was definitely interesting.  I wish the narration had been executed with a more interesting and informative style. The characters, including the main character seem unrealistic.  The book is interesting if only for the basic plot.  Apart from that, the quality of the text is poor. <br />It is too bad the author didn't spend as much time on her novel as the Vermeer did on his portrait.	2001-04-04

It was one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.  The plot, connected with real Biblical-events, was wonderful!  I could not put the book down.  <br />Having a glimpse into the lives of women of Biblical times was a gift, I had never really been interested in, but after, The Red Tent, it is a subject I won't soon forget, or take advantage of.<br />I thought reading a book about a man with numerous wives would be somewhat difficult to swallow, but the strength of the women in this novel was unimaginable.  <br />This is a definite must-read, for both women, and men!	2001-03-22

I began this book with less-than-enthusiastic ideas.  I thought it would be dull, and trite.  However, I loved this book, like I have loved few, in recent reads.  It has a stunning read-ability.  It is a treasure that is filled with historical information.  I couldn't wait to discuss certain facts with my French stepfather, whom, I knew, would be impressed.  The book is a quaint reminder that the French Revolution was not an entirely just event, and that one can read both sides of a story, and find equally poignant information in both.  <br />I recommend this book wholeheartedly!	2001-03-22

While the subject matter, is, without question, interesting, the book, at times, was a bit trite.  The style was not one that I particularly enjoyed, however, there was so much information to be absorbed, that I could not put it down.  I didn't feel it was really a page-turner, until, of course, the bits with an execution, or a new wife appeared.  I did not feel any compassion towards Henry, though, and it gave me a new grasp on his madness.  <br />If you are interested in learning a bit about the period, read it, if you are looking for a real page-turner, this is not really a book to look to.	2001-03-22

The title of my review may sound overwhelming, but all of the above is true for &quot;The Red Tent&quot;.  A girlfriend of mine let me borrow it before letting several of her other friends borrow it as well.  It was so interesting to read a story that made another era seem so incredibly realistic.  Anita Diamant brings you directly into an era that is virtually unknown to us.  It was a motivating book, that brought out the bonds between women.  Everything is faced in this book, nothing is ignored, and it boldly goes where no book I've read before goes.	2001-01-01
