It is definitely as good as my favorite book, so now I have two favorite books.  There are some French words and phrases in the book, which I am able to translate.  I love Paris, France, and the French language, and everything about France, which also motivated me to read this book.  There are some factual information charts and sayings in the book from the real Jack the Ripper evidence which is amazingly interesting!

I have to say that it is not going to be the last. She writes like the style of Barbara Michaels and I have been want to read at least one of her books for a long time, now I know I will like the way she writes. This book is set in Scotland on an archaeological dig. The little boy, Robbie, has the second site, and it's haunting, especially to the main character, Miss Verity Grey. While Verity begins her job in Scotland she falls in love, but is still scared because it is with someone she shouldn't fall in love with. This book was absolutely great and is one of my favorites. Don't miss this great thriller!	2001-08-28

This is a great book for behind the scenes pictures of the cast and the stage they worked on. I have owned this book for about a year, and come back to look at it all the time. Lucille Ball is my favorite actress, and I just love her to pieces! This book contains photos of their set and everyday life. It also conatains some stories of their lives, so if you are a Lucy fan like me, don't miss this book!	2001-08-25

I really enjoyed this book. &quot;Rose Cottage&quot; is the first book I have read by Mary Stewart, and I really loved it! I am an avid mystery reader and romantic suspense reader and this had a little of both, not much romance, tough. The main character is Kate or Kathy and she returns to her old childhood home in England called Rose Cottage. Her grandmother has sent her there to retrieve some old keep sakes from a safe Kate never new had existed. Kate arrives there to find the entire safe empty. During this mystery, she meets old friends and comes across new mystries, and most shocking of all the dark secrets from her past and her family. You will enjoy this book! Read it!	2001-08-24

I have to say she is a very good writer.  &quot;Rainbow's End&quot; got me hooked from the very beginning to the end.  This book has a wonderful plot and the characters are believeable and hilarious!  The main character is Richard Jury and he has a suspicious beleif that these three &quot;natural&quot; deaths are connected and they were not &quot;natural causes.&quot;  He travels from Stonehenge, England to Sante Fe, New Mexico and discovers...well you read it for yourself!!!

I am an avid mystery reader and romantic suspense reader, there was suspense (little) and romance, but not enough of mystery and suspense for my taste.  I often found myself falling asleep while reading this book, but some parts did have some thrilling moments.  If you like slower paced books, then I would suggest that you read this book.  I definitely will not read Stargazer at the result of the Water Nymph.  This is a good book, and she is a good writer but I do not like slower paced books.  Sometimes the characters were not very believeable, and when there was suspense, it went as soon as it came.	2001-08-19

Lucille Ball is my favorite Actress and my all-time hero.  I read this book, only because she is my hero, but I like mystery books.  Lucille Ball has a wonderful sense of humor, as you already know, and she interwinds it in her book.  This book has pictures of her and her family, tells about her life, and has some secrets inside that were never told.  If you are a Lucy fan, like me, you will not want to pass up the opporunity of reading this book.  Enjoy, her life!  Sometimes it is sad to read, but you will pull through it and see the REAL Lucille Ball.	2001-08-17

She is an extremely good writer, but she still needs to learn some more skills.  This book is about a girl who is missing, and I was expecting a certain kind of writing and cocnclusion, and it did not happen the way I thought it would.  The girl who was missing was...and I don't appreciate that kind of ending for a mystery book.  I was blown away by the murderer and other non-suspect who did it-incredible!  I have to congratulate her on that!!!  Any way, not the way I expected it to turn out, but it was a very good book.	2001-08-15

I absolutely loved reading it!  The ending is unbelieveable, and the book had me hooked until the end.  He better write more books because I am sure going to buy more from him.  If you like mystery and suspense with a little bit of a scary edge, I definitely recommend this book to you.  This book is one of my favorites.  You will be totally swept off your feet when you read the end.  I am adding this book to my favorites list.

This was not very &quot;romantic&quot; and the mystery was completely unreal.  The descriptions were good, but the characters were definitely not believable.  It was an ok book, but I probably won't buy another by her.  This is the first book I have read by Carla, and I am not too impressed.  Most romantic supense books have ROMANCE AND SUSPENSE in them, this one had barely any of either.	2001-08-03

Dee Davis has done it again with a great novel.  &quot;After Twilight&quot; was a great novel as well and this is another reflection of her talent.  This book is full of suspense, mystery, murder mystery, and romance.  Although she isn't my favorite author, so far, I would have to say that she is my second favorite.  Those of you who buy this book, which I hope you do, will find it incredibly boring in some places, but I give it a five star rating because of its suspense and just the right amount of romance for my taste.  Don't miss this book if you're a mystery and thrillers lover just like me, and you like a little bit of romance to spice up your read.	2001-07-30

Dee Davis has literally shown her potential for writing a great novel.  This is the first book I have read by her, and I am already starting on the one that just came out called &quot;Just Breathe&quot; and I already have a feeling it will be as good as this one.  I only read romance books if there is suspense and mystery in it, that is what intrigued my to read this book.  So, if any of you are suspense and mystery readers like me that like a little bit of romance, I most definitely recommend this book.  It is a great story with a wonderful plot with suspense, mystery, and just the right amount of romance.	2001-07-25

I have never read any of John Saul's books, but I know I will continue to read them because he is a fantastic writer!  Nightshade was an amazingly gripping and suspenseful book, with wonderful story lines and a great plot.  A very unsuspecting ending occurs that I would have had no idea it could have possibly happen.  This book was awesome, and if you haven't read any of his books...you should.  Nightshade is a masterpiece!  I recommend this book to everyone who likes thrillers.	2001-07-08
