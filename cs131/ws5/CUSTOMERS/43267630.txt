But for some reason I find Phil Jackson an intriuging figure so I bought the book.  This is not a Kobe bashing book.  It does give his point of view about him and their relationship, which is not great but the book seems to show how he tried to make it better for he and the fellow players during this trying season.  What I mostly got from the book, was a suprising look at how this franchise (and probably most others) operates under the scrutiny of the press, fans and the NBA. His account shows just how hard he worked in the shadow of being the coach of one of the most celebrated teams in the history of the NBA and the whole Kobe Bryant/Shaq deal. <br />I actually came to respect Jackson for his work and dedication to the sport of basketball.  He makes you see basketball for the game that it is and how that game has actually lost its innocence since the onset of it being a money generating sport. <br />It's an easy read... <br />I still can't justify how these people can command the money that they do...but you see the human side of him and that just because he deals for multi-million dollar contracts, he still believes in a game that made him who he is and almost appears to mourn the loss of what it used to be.	2005-01-18

She still has a thing for Dave the Laugh but meets a new guy in this book <br />Georgia's parents are focused on more in this book and her wise cracks about them are hilarious.  I laughed out loud multiple times when reading it.  The only thing that I don't get is the title.  I might have missed something while reading! <br />Worth buying and reading.  It is a quick read, only taking me a couple nights to do so. <br />If you haven't read any of the other books in the series, here is the list in the order they should be read: <br />1.

I found this book while perusing the book store and it caught my attention so I bought it and read it.  <BR>The book is well written and speaks to a non-biologist audience.  It simply tells of the authors investigations into the reasons that they think the sea turtles are dying off at an alarming rate.  It left me with my mouth gaping open and wondering why more people are not educated about the plight of this species.  <BR>While reading, the author makes you feel a part of their experiences, as if you were scuba diving with these creatures.  <BR>If the data from this book is any indication of the plight of the Earth's oceans, it is a very scary thought of what may be to come.  <BR>I recommend this book for ANYONE who is inquisitive about the hype surrounding &quot;our dying oceans&quot;.  It gives a detailed account of the afflictions affecting sea turtles and what we are trying to do to save them.  The problem appears to go way beyond this mysterious virus.  The book made me cry and get angry at the same time.  We need to find out what is happening and target the source.<BR>In the preface of the paperback edition, the author makes this statement:  &quot;If I could coin a blessing for a new world, it would be this:  May your children swim in an ocean full of turtles.&quot;  Amen to that Osha Gray Davidson.	2004-03-04

It gives a wonderful detail of the geologic history of the lakes and the landscape around them.  The author has a true appreciation for these living lakes and evokes that throughout his writing.  If you live around the Great Lakes region, you will gain a new appreciation for how lucky we are to be by them and a new sense of desire to protect them.  I used excerpts from this book to teach a high school earth science class when studying the hydrosphere and meterology.  I recommend this book to any naturalist, Great Lakes region residence, or for anyone who wants to know why the largest source of fresh water on the planet is worth saving and preserving.	2004-01-31

I didn't really have time to sit down and read it, so I got the audio cassettes.  The reader (Colin Stinton) is excellent at reading the story.  He has many different voices that he changes to for different charachters.  I find this quite astonishing acutally, because sometimes, I can't tell that it is the same person speaking all these voices.<br />The story line is magnificent.  It is a fast paced novel from start to finish.  The only disappoinment I have is when it ended...now I have to find another book as entertaining as this one!<br />You will not be disappointed with the audio version of this book.  The reader keeps you going and connected to the charachters and Dan Brown's story is compelling!	2003-09-04

She started off by reading the beginning of a book called Hiroshima which talked about the airplane taking off that had the atomic bomb on it which was destined to be dropped on Hiroshima.  She then had the students read Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes.  It was a wonderful lesson.  I think that the children really learned how the effects of the A bomb lasted for so long.  Sadako gets leukemia from the radiation left from the A bomb.  It describes rememberance day from and how the Japenese people were affected by this event in history.<BR>  <BR>I think it was a wonderful lesson for students to experience what occurred to the people of Japan from their viewpoint.  I bought this book for my nephew to read because I think it is so important for kids to understand effects of war from \\"the other side's\\" viewpoint.  I think that it will help build tolerance and understanding about tough issues such as the effects from the A bomb and what it did to the Japanese people.<br />I think this is a great book for parents to read to their upper elementary kids.  It will open up a line of discussion that might otherwise be overlooked.	2003-04-05

I read the first two Harry Potter books and then got the audio cassettes for number 3 and 4.  These books are great!  I listen to a lot of audio books because I drive a lot and I get sick of the radio after a while.  Some audio books are hard to keep paying attention to while listening.  That is not the case with this particular one.<br />There are 12 tapes that are 1 and 1/2 hour long.  I got so intrigued that I finished it within a week.  I listened while driving, cooking supper and even while doing some house painting.  The Goblet of Fire is delving further into the mystery of Harry and his world.  I am hooked and just can't wait for the next one.<br />If you don't have a lot of time to read and want to discover some true talent of story telling, try these books on audio.  It is a great story and the reader does an excellent job of changing his voice for different charachters and setting the scene for what is going on.<br />I can see why the man that read these books for audio recieved so many awards.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat!	2003-04-05

I learned a lot about things in the book that I just took with a grain of salt.  <BR>Their predictions for the future books are just as enticing also.  <BR>This is a great refresher book to read prior to the 5th one coming out in June.

It is wonderful.  The reader (who is a male with british accent) does a great job telling the story and changes his voice while speaking different charachter parts (Harry, Herimone, Professor McGonagul, etc.)<BR>Time will fly while you are in the car when listening.  I have gotten so caught up in the story line that I have actually sat in my driveway in my car for more than a 1/2 hour after arriving because I couldn't \\"pull\\" myself away from the story.  I actually look forward to driving when such a great story is being told.<BR>There are (7) 1 and 1/2 hour tapes in this set.  Very worth it!  I was going to read the 4th book but I decided that since this has been so much fun listening to, and makes time fly by in my car, that I am going to listen to #4 this way also.<BR>I recommend...especially for people that are in the car a lot or traveling and can take along a headset.

He then describes them further in depth so that you can figure out which one you are.  Then it explains temperment based on the combinations of personality charachteristics.  The next few chapters are devoted to being able to put all this together so that you can spot the different personality types.  In the final section, there are actual exercises to &quot;test&quot; yourself and to sharpen your skills.<BR>There are numerous examples of what to look for to guess what charachteristic best fits a person.  There are also very short examples to be able to test out, just in casual conversation, with co-workers/friends.  <BR>This is a great book and fun to read/do the exercises to try out your new gained insight.  This book will certainly not make you a personality expert but it will help you appreciate the differences and gain tolerance.  It was also fun to discover that the &quot;quirks&quot; in my personality are actually quite common...like, my car is always messy no matter what, and that is indicative of a &quot;perciever&quot;.  It was also fun to do some of the exercises on my friends...like having them give me directions.  This is a clue to determine if the person is a &quot;thinker or feeler&quot;.  <BR>I recommend this book!  Fun, fun, fun!	2003-01-14

I just started making martini's and this book has really helped me.  There are a lot of recipes (I think around 200).  A lot of these recipes are just variations of garnish but there are many, many other recipes for every martini you could ever think of.  The Cosmopolitan, Manhattan, Winston Churchill's recipe, the Daydream Martini, the apple martini, cajun, peppermint, coffee martini, etc., etc., etc.  The beginning of the book talks about the difference between gin and vodka martini's, how to set up your martini bar, the difference between shaking and stirring, the history of martini shakers, the difference in selections of vermouth and famus martini drinkers.  There are also quotes throughout the book about martinis.  It is a great book and would be an excellent guide to have in your bar for making martini's.  And for people who want to perfect making different kinds of martini's, this is a great book.  This book is excellent for veterans and newcomers to the drink.	2003-01-13

I recently read this book and there are some good points to it. The author describes a condition known as tension myositis syndrome.  This concept is described as a de-oxygen state to tissues of the body.  The term myositis is \\"inflammtion of muscle tissue\\" but this is misleading.  The author states that it can also occur in ligaments and nerve tissue.  His theory states that, after an initial injury, the body heals but that we continue to have pain.  He states that the pain that continues is not due to the actual injury but the neural pathways leading to the brain that continue to \\"tell\\" the brain that we have pain.  The author feels that it is a conditioned response that continues long after the injury has healed.  So we \\"train\\" ourselves to think that we will have pain with certain activities.  <br />There is plenty of theory and the basis for his theory in this book but it does not give a lot of treatment guidelines.  <br />It made me see pain in a new perspective and to not be so \\"scared\\" of doing things.  However, I continue to have pain even after gaining this information.  I am lead to believe that this concept may be of help to some people if they truly have TMS.  This theory is not a blanket concept for all people who suffer from back pain.  There are many causes of back pain and this is just one of the many.	2002-11-03

This book is very informative when it comes to this concept of &quot;trigger points&quot; and how to find specific points in the muscles that cause surface and referred pain.  It also helps to explain what causes trigger points and what to do about them.  It gives detailed explaination on the use of trigger point therapy and how to apply the techniques.  Nothing will replace stretching and strengthening to rid yourself of chronic muscle conditions, but this will help you to understand what trigger points are and how to deal with them.  Self treatment is also explained.

I would not say this about most books or textbooks of this nature, but I sat down just to &quot;glance&quot; through it, and found myself 2 hours later still reading it.  The theories of coevolution, origin of AIDS and even &quot;where is God in all this&quot; in contained within this book.  It is great.  I recommend it, even for the non-scientist!	2002-05-20

I literally read it in less than half of a day.  I didn't want to put it down because it is so funny...and true.  It is written in diary format and very easy to read.  The language barrier between Brit's and American can get somewhat confusing but there is a glossary in the back so that you can look up words if you cannot understand them.  This book is basically a younger Bridget Jones...very humorous, very real world.  <BR>Georgia has all the trials and tribulations with her pals and family that a typical middle class girl would go through.  Her cat is psycho but makes it all that much funnier.<BR>I recommend it for girls ages 12 and up...they will definitely be able to relate!	2002-05-06

It has an introductory section so that you know who the charachters are and what they mean.  It also has a detailed section on the weapons that you can use.  It then gives details on each one of the villians (NMC's) and the best weapons against each of them.  It also explains how to use the parasite energy's and what you have to attain to upgrade each one.  The last section of the book is a walk through, play by play, on getting through each section of the game.  Some of this is a bit sketchy but it is enough information should you get stuck in a section of the game.  The author recommends that you not use the play by play section unless you are really &quot;stuck&quot; because it will take the mystery and excitement out of the game.  I have used it several times, especially when having to decode riddles.  It is an excellent resource if you are the kind of person who gets really frustrated when &quot;stuck&quot; at certain sections of a video game.  There are many different pathways to get to the ending of the game which I don't think I would have even realized had I not used the guide.  I recommend it, especially if you are new to this kind of game or if you are not familiar with the first Parasite Eve or other Brady games.

The book has a lot of great ideas in it and well laid out plans for things such as classroom management, discipline and motivation.  Every page is &quot;packed full&quot; though (sometimes information overload, so you don't read everything becuase there si so much).  It is almost like a text book in that the story line continues and there are boxes of text elsewhere on the page.

It is plain written and does not \\"juice up\\" anything to make the story line more exciting.  The book goes through his rookie season of 2000, race by race.  He speaks about race car set up, run in's with fans, the media, actions taken on the track during a race, and what is was like to race with his father.  The book also gives a small glimpse into his personal life as far as an overview of his years growing up and the things that he encountered.  I was so hoping for more intimate details of romance in his life...or things about women that he has dated.  He mentions this particular subject with regards to the \\"Bud\\" girls and a few others but that is it.  He is truly a party type guy and speaks often in the book about being drunk/hung over and \\"hanging out with friends.\\"  He does not give specific details about partying or going out though.  If you are a race fan then this book will be enjoyable.  I found myself skipping some of the minute by minute race recap though.  So I was jumping around through the book...which you can easily do...especially if you remember the 2000 season.  And that is exactly what the book is about (no mention of his father's death in retrospect or anything like that).  There is an epilouge included at the end of the book that reflects on his father's death and the Pepsi 400 in 2001.  Junior talks about that special victory and what it meant to him.  I feel like I know this driver better.  He is a typical 26 year old man that is good at driving stock cars and has been thrust into the limelight because of a very famous father.  He likes to drink beer, play video games and hang out with friends.  And that is as deep as it gets (or at least as deep as this book gets).  I am a NASCAR fan but also an avid book reader...I gave this book 3 stars because there are better biographies/autobiographies than this.  If I was rating this in regards to NASCAR books only,I would give it a 5.	2002-03-11

I bought this out of curiousity and I can frankly say that it has enlightened me.  I now know \\"who is who\\" and \\"who married who\\" and why JFK was the one \\"picked\\" to run for president.  I wish the book would have delve into Jackie's life a bit more, but overall you get a very good picture of the men and women of the Kennedy name.  And I guess I knew JFK was a player, but, oh my!  I didn't realize the list was so long.  I would recommend it if you are on the same level as I am about this subject.

It is entertaining and a nice break from Grisham's usual story lines.  It is also easy to read, taking no time at all.  It is enjoyable the whole way through.  I didn't find myself at any time struggling to get through a &quot;boring&quot; part to get on with the plot.  It doesn't have to be Christmas time either to get the feel of what is going on.

If you remember having 4 best friends and all the times you shared or if you currently are in high school and can relate to this, you will love this book.  It didn't turn out the way that I foresaw and was very entertaining.  It only took me 2 days to read it.  This would be a great gift for a girl 12-16 years old who likes to read.

She is smart and a cut throat business woman.  The book is somewhat slow in the beginning but picks up after that and makes you want to continue reading until the end.  Once again, Sheldon puts in the suprise ending.  I recommend it.	2001-12-19
