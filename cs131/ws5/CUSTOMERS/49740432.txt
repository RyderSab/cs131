Part 1 is mostly written in the now while Part 2 deals with a 227 day trip after a shipwreck. Pi survives in a boat with some animals, his father had a zoo in India, but after a while only survives with a tiger. <br /> <br />If everything has really happened is up for debate. when he arrives in Mexico he is interrogated by the Japanese people who owned the ship and some other facts surface. However, they find the story so incredible and amazing that they stick with that version. <br /> <br />And so do I, it's a great story. Sometimes it has the feel of 'the old man and the sea', sometimes of all the books you read about shipwrecks. The writing is very clear and therefor it won't take you long to read. You will keep reading anyway.	2005-10-05

It also hard for me to write a review because there is so much going on in this book. <br />Cal(liope) was born a girl and is now a man, this because of inbreeding of a Greek-(American) family. A family that came from Turkey. And like this there are many people with two identities, or with one identity in an otherwise different world.  <br /> <br />The narrative is amazing. Sometimes it reminded me of John Irving who writes books spanning 3 or more generations where all of sudden bad things like death happens. <br /> <br />It is Cal who talks to the reader, but sometimes also about himself in the third person. Not \\"I\\" did this, but \\"Calliope\\" did this. IT certainly shows the difficulty with identity, one that has changed so much that the self becomes a third person.  <br /> <br />It's so well written, so inventive, so full of themes and symbolism (the names alone are worth a study) that you will be amazed and want to read it again when you have finished it.  <br /> <br />\\"Middlesex\\" (get it?) I thought would be a normal novel about the county in Mass., but it's so much better.  <br />Some people complain about the current state of American literature but this novel is one of the most amazing novels to come out of the US in the new century. <br /> <br />	2005-09-08

This was very insightful book based on his travels around the world. <br /> <br />'A Day in the Life' is about a completely different subject: The Beatles, and to be more precise: the music of the Beatles. <br /> <br />The book does go into how the band got together and how the bandmembers related to each other, but it is done to give a better understanding to the way the made the music. <br /> <br />Of course most of it is about the songwriting tandem of McCartney and Lennon. There are some remarks about what they thought about each other writings. (McCartney's being somewhat sweet) but they complete each other. The best part is about how the worked in the studio and especially the role of producer George Martin and his working with orchestras, strange sounds etc. It truely gives an insight into why the records of the Albums are as important as they are, not only in how the songs are created, but also the extra instrumentation and soundscapes around it. <br /> <br />The part on 'Strawberry Fields forever' is a great part and it truely let's us know why this songs is one of the alltime greatest songs ever, even though Lennon wasn't too satisfied with the end-product. <br /> <br />For Beatles fans and musicfans: this book is a good read	2005-07-10

Clarke novels often have some of the following elements: mankind progresses and invents new things, the inevitable clash with religion, the start of a new history of mankind and a meeting with alien life, most always more intelligent than us. <br /> <br />And still, every novel is a joy to read as is \\"The Fountains of Paradise\\". An ambitious man wants to build an elevator from here to the geostationary orbit. The book follows the initial difficulties (economical, political and religious) to get the project started and then the building itself. <br /> <br />There is a meeting with alien life, a little like in Rama and it teaches mankind a lot, though the link with the general story is hard to get sometimes. <br /> <br />As always, this Clarke book is a great story about what mankind is able to do in a few centuries.	2005-05-30

Clarke I fall from one amazement into another. Like in the Rama series he always knows how to let you know that there is something going on which you will find out a little later, so you keep on reading. <br /> <br />This book is no different but it's one of Clarke's best. Again he knows to blend science, occultism and even religion into one great story. <br /> <br />A group of aliens come to earth and hover their ships above the great cities of the world (think Independance Day), they are not out for the ruling of the world but know to end war and poverty within a few years and mankind enters a golden age. After 50 years they finally make themselves known and they look a lot like the old medieval devil images. Later the children of the world enter a new phase of existence (another common Clarke theme) and the world enters a new phase. <br /> <br />Be surprised all over again, a magnificent read	2005-05-26

Warning!: if people are honest you might hear some things you'd rather not read. In this case however, it does mean that through Ray Charles' own words we hear about his life up till 1978 when the book came out.  <br /> <br />His youth was hard, becoming blind around age 7, going to a special school and losing his mom when she was only in her thirties were hard. Music is of course the theme that runs through it all, though I personally would have liked to have read more about the musical side of his life than the two things that make up an important part of the book: heroin and sex. <br /> <br />He seems to have been addicted to both but he has always said that heroin was his own choice and that he wasn't pushed into it by other people. That makes it all very openhearted and in a way bearable. The part where he decided to stop smack is heartbreaking and genuine. <br /> <br />He also talks lightly about his blindness, which is great, you forget most of the time that he couldn't see a thing. <br /> <br />The ghostwriter himself has carefully written that Ray himself went over the pages time and time again so we can be pretty sure that everything in it is true to his heart. <br /> <br />We could have done with some more musical history, but it's a great book to read nonetheless	2005-05-22

The book is nicely devided into different styles of instrumentals (or instro's) that usually also fall into a certain time frame.  <br /> <br />As a close follower of books on soul I have always missed writings on the back-up bands that were in the studio with the great singers like Sam Cooke. He recorded a lot of albums with Plas Johnson, Earl Palmer and Rene Hall but they are never really mentioned in detail in books on him. This little book however is even dedicated to them. <br /> <br />It seems the writer was the biggest fan of surf instrumentals (most notably the Surfaris). When I bought the book I initially thought it would only be on surf, but it's a lot wider. <br /> <br />It is also a very funny book, the author has used humor in his writing, especially for the really quircky songs.  <br /> <br />For the interested in 50's and 60's rock and roll, r&B, country and soul this book is well worth getting.	2005-05-21

A New History of Black Gospel Music	Books	5	12	15	N	N	Definitive History on Gospel	As a fan of Sam Cooke I started to listen to his earlier gospel music as a member of the Soul Stirrers and was very impressed. In classes and through reading more the story of spirituals and gospel became a great interest, though sometimes fragmented or too short.  <br /> <br />But now I've read the excellent \\"People Get Ready!\\" and this book will tell you everything you need to know from the earliest beginnings in Africa to contemporary times. <br /> <br />He paints a picture from the Western African tribes and their styles of music, right through the coded ways of singing to elude the white slave masters. The most interesting part of the books ends for me somewhere in the 1960's. <br /> <br />You don't have to be religious (I'm not) to enjoy the music and the book. It is very clearly shown through Mr. Darden's writing that the influence of gospel on rock and roll, soul etc is great, a lot greater than many people think.  <br /> <br />\\"People Get Ready\\" will teach you everything you need to know on the history of gospel, and through that also a large part of the history of rock and roll in America.	2005-05-15

Unfortunately for the Kennedy family many died prematurely, as is well recognized. <br /> <br />Most Kennedy books will be focused on John F and his brother Robert F who were both shot. But in this book they still play main parts, but not the only ones. The book starts when the Kennedy's, and Fitzgeralds, came to America and how they quickly rose in first Boston and later American society, even though they had one big disadvantage; they were Irish. <br /> <br />JFK's grandfather Honey Fitz became mayor of Boston by using the Irish vote. Joe Kennedy Sr. started out selling newspapers but was soon a movie producer, even having an alleged affair with movie star Gloria Swanson, something his sons would later copy with Marylin Monroe of course. <br /> <br />Then came the biggest move in Joe Kennedy's life; he became Ambassador in England under Roosevelt, with whom he had a somewhat strained relationship. He would ever since be referred to as the Ambassador, even in his own family. <br /> <br />Collier and Horowitz make it clear that the Ambassador is the most important member of the Kennedy family and that every child's actions are in some way related to him. The story is sometimes a little TV-movie sentimental, but whould would you do if you lose 4 children when you are still alive. The oldest son Joe dies in a WWII plane crash, his oldest daughter marries but loses her noble husband soon and dies herself in a plane crash a few months later. <br /> <br />And of course there are the deaths of JFK and RFK. <br /> <br />It's certainly not a hagiography telling how great the Kennedy's were. Old Joe Kennedy is sometimes shown as a towering figure who completely dominated his family's life until his stroke. JFK got his last rites twice and was often very sick with pain in his back and Addisson'sdesease. His medication is mentioned in the book and also are his numorous flings with women in the White House, his own house, even Airforce One. RFK seems to have been the most moral person and I believe the authors feel that way too. They explain his religion, his fight against organized crime and Jimmy Hoffa and also his meetings with minorities all over the world. He seemed to have had the Kennedy promise even more than his brother Jack or later Ted. <br /> <br />The last part of the book is devoted to the next generation who cannot seem to deal with their heritage and often get into trouble, it seems as if everyone in the family is doing drugs, the last Kennedy death in the old edition, even loses his life because of it. <br /> <br />It's a gripping story that sometimes reads like a novel. I think it gave a balanced story of the family with the good but also the bad, which made them even more human. It's a lot clearer now why the family was so loved and hated at the same time. <br /> <br />A must-read for Kennedy-admirer and Kennedy-hater alike. <br /> <br />	2005-04-08

He took it upon himself to go to America and interview pretty much all the persons who played a part in Wilson's life and therefore it is well researched and thurough. It is also not a hagiography like many other music-biographies are, he definitely pays attention to the womanizing side and addictiveness of Wilson. <br /> <br />The stories about him in the end of his life as a vegetable but also the death of many of his children are harrowing. But also the early beginning are well covered. <br /> <br />It is however hard to follow sometimes, the chronology sometimes doesnt make sense or is badly constructed, making you sometimes flipping back to see where you are. Another thing is that more years, months and dates could have been used to have a better view of where he was in life. <br /> <br />His friendships with other soul singers are interesting and some things are mentioned that I hadn't read in other books, about Sam Cooke for example. The discography in the back is adequate. <br /> <br />There are not that many biographis on Jackie Wilson so therefore it's worth the read, but maybe someone should take it upon himself to write another wne that can equal Daniel Woolf's 'You Send Me' about Sam Cooke.	2005-02-10

If you read the afterword and know what everything that is written actually happened you would think the latter. And it is, but the writing is so compelling it is also a piece of literature like Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\". <br /> <br />In short, the story is about Gary Gilmore, a villain who has been in jails and correction centers for most of his life but who has never been corrected, maybe even the opposite. He gets out of jail, works in a shoe store and meets Nicole, the number one person for him for the rest of his life. His life outside of jail is one of drugs, violence and a lot of drinking, until one day he brutally kills two people. He is then sentenced to get the death-penalty, which had a moratorium for few years. Even though many groups like the ACLU try to stop this he actually wants to get the Death Penalty. The last pages are excrusiating, does he get it or not? <br /> <br />Gary Gilmore was a menace, not a nice person who kept drinking and making other people's lives miserable. I had to be really careful not to feel some kind of sympathy for him however. Was het a victim of society and/or the prison system? In the end I actually was hoping he would not die. <br /> <br />The lives of the other people around him are also masterfully told. From his immediate family to the lawyers that came in later. <br /> <br />This book is great of you want a book about average Americans, about the legal system, the Death Penalty and interestingly enough also the Mormon Church.  <br />It may be more than a 1000 pages but every one is worth it. The chapters are short and also divided into smaller parts. Because of the writing style you can put it away for a few days and pick it up again.	2004-11-23

This because they were taken by the devil. To get rid of the witches and therefore the devil they had to be tried and afterwards liquidated. The most famous case was of course in Salem, MA 1692. Arthur Miller wrote the play `The Crucible' as a parable of McCarthy Era America and the movie does the same thing. For a long time the events in Salem were soon as a strange case in history, Boyer and Nissenbaum decided to look at the records and writings of that era again and came up with a fascinating new history of the Salem witchtrials. <br /> <br />The looked at the lives of the people in Salem from the beggar to the minister and also at three of the leading families in Salem. The minister Parrish plays the most important role in their story because they devide the town up into two camps; the pro and contra Parrish people. They find out that mixed in this is also the strife within one family with ties to another important Salem factory. For B&N the witchtrials are more a battleground of different social groups than the fight against the devil. <br /> <br />They unfortunately did not entirely look at the more psychological reasons for the events. Salem was not alone in it's social build and therefore something like this should have happened in more places, but it didn't.  <br /> <br />This book has often been heralded as an important book in the post-modern historical society for looking at more things and the people too, except the rulers. It also shows how easy it is to debunk myths if you just look at the sources.  <br /> <br />If yore are interested in the witch trials this book will certainly be liked. <br />	2004-09-27

One Civilization (Islam) attacking another (the West). Certainly in the book we can read a lot of precursors to this event and in way predicted it. <br /> <br />Unofortunately the world has changed so much that this book needs an update. The world has changed and the wars talked about in the book (like the Caucasus) still reign. But I do believe reality is not as simple as this is, since people are becoming more aware of the world, definitely in the student population that increasingly travels all over the world to study, getting into contact with new people and new civilizations. The main language there is English and that will remain to be so, even though Huntington tries to make us believe otherwise. <br /> <br />His view on the world in 7 distinct civs is a helpful one. That the major wars will be between civs is probably true, the last few years have shown that much.  <br /> <br />Reading this book will definitely give you a much clearer view on how the world is structured but don't forget that the world is now in a new post-9-11 fase. In the end he offers a scenario of a future world war which is just absurd.	2004-09-24

In this case the Barry family consisting of one grandfather, two parents and 5 children, all with their own strange habits. <br />The grandfather is a football coach that coaches the team of a school in New Hampshire. They always have losing seasons except for the last season when they get some players that are waiting to go into college and are here to strengthen. One of them is the afwul quarterback Chipper Dove and the awesome running back Junior Jones. Iowa Bob (the coach) meets his end when he sees the taxidermed body of the old dog Sorrow (Irving is great with names). <br />Father Win Berry is a dreamer and always a person at the back of the story. He meets a bear-tamer from Austria named Freud and adores him. He starts a hotel (The First Hotel NH) with his wive. His wive is so pure that we don't hear a lot about her. <br />The children are Frank, John and Franny. Franny to me is the most important person. She gets raped by Chipper Dove and saved by Junior Jones but the rape remains a part of her and the family for their entire live. The younger children are Egg and Lilly, who will always remain small. <br /> <br />they sell the hotel in New Hampshire and move to Vienna to start the second hotel NH with Freud. On the way to Europe the plane carrying mother and Egg crashes. Rescue planes only see a stuffed dog floating in the water (Sorrow floats). They have to start life again and father loses yet another part of him. The hotel is full of left-wing radicals planning to blow up the Opera and prostitutes. There is also a woman in a bear suit called Susie, she was also raped. <br /> <br />A bombing goes awry because Freud uses a baseball bat to detonate the bomb, blinding father. Thanks to the money Lilly made for writing about the family theyreturn to the US and go live in NY. After a while John and Susie move to Maine and start a rape center. <br /> <br />The typical Irving-elements are here again: great humor, great tragedy and great personalities. There are of course similarities with other books.  <br />Size: Lilly and Owen Meany, a care-center in Garp, baseball in Owen Meany etc. <br />There is so much more I could tell about my favorite IRving book, how Junior Jones from the Black Arm of the Law in highschool saving Franny becomes a lawyer, etc. and how they finally pay back Chipper Dove for what he did. It's great reading which will make you cry: with laugher and with Sorrow	2004-09-16

It is always hard to believe autobriographies, especially in the music-biz where people are fighting others constantly for power, money and all those things. Since Berry Gordy is a controversial figure, we have to doubt it.<br />Doesn't take away the fact that is interesting seeing the rise of his Motown label through his eyes. He discoverd many acts and also wrote and produced many hits in the 50's through 80's. Jackie Wilson, Martha Reeves, Mary Wells, The Supremes, Four Tops, Temptations and Miracles all are very much part of the Gordy legacy.<br />He started as a boxer, admiring Joe Louis before turning to music. One of his earliest friends was Smokey Robinson, someone who he also admired and who never turned his back to him. Something the Jackson 5 did, though they were almost part of his family.<br />His familymember were often married to people from his company. Jermaine Jackson and Marvin Gaye for example.

Not a great soldier or tactician but someone who was instrumental behind the scenes as a provider of weaponry and of course as a messenger. <br />For those interested in daily life AND the Revolutionary War this book is great.

It deals with politics but also with personal problems like disease in the family and the death of a son due to alcohol.<br />His relationship with Thomas Jefferson is fascinating; sometimes loving, sometimes hating. They could not get along when they were president and vice-president. In the end through letters they come closer again and freakingly enough they die on the same day, the 4th of July when they were there signing the Declaration of Independence.	2004-06-22

For those interested in the military side it is interesting. He also writes a little about the politics behind it, though never really critizing it vehemently. It's a good reference book and I think well researched.	2004-06-15

Also 5 Appendixes are added dealing with stress, loads and more engineering things, which can also be found on the PBS site on buildings.	2004-06-10

This book was recommended to me by my architecture professor and it is well worth reading. Without going into too much physics the author explains clearly the importance of forces like wind on structures like bridges, skyscrapers, domes etc. To illustrate these infuences there are chapters on some of the architectural wonders of the world: Eiffel Tower, Pyramids, Brooklyn Bridge and Aya Sofia to name but a few. <br />There are no photographs in this book but crudely drawn pictures, which actually makes the reader understand the concepts better. <br />If you like buildings and architecture in general this book is instrumental in the understandings of why buildings stand up.	2004-06-10

'Plan of Attack' is the sequel, this time dealing with the planning of the war on Iraq. We get an in-depth view into the views of people like Rumsfeld, Powell and president Bush. Powell wants to use diplomacy as long as possible while the hawks in the cabinet are more ready to use force. It makes Bush look like a stronger leader than he is sometimes made out to be, if we can believe Bob Woodward however. There are no breaking stories in this book but I think it gives a great look at how the planning of a war works.	2004-06-06

Of all the three Moore books this is the most about American issues and hardly any foreign policy things. It was written just before the Dole-Clinton fight in 1996 which Clinton of course won.<br />His books are funny, it is almost like watching a stand-up show but only reading the text. When you have ever heard MM speak you can image him shouting this out, it's hilarious. The chapters on Hillary Clinton, Steve Forbes and sperm are so incredibly funny I could not stop laughing.

It is the tragic story of a man who practices dentistry without a license and marries a girl who won $5000 in a lottery but keeps it all to herself. The first few years of their marriage are pleasant; the only negative thing is that his friendship with Marcus is over. He wanted to marry Trina, McTeague's wife and Marcus' niece, but did not get her. He tells the authorities and then the life of Trina and McTeague goes down. Without ever using money of the $5000 McTeague loses his practice and they grow apart. He starts hitting and abusing her and in the end does the most horrible thing. First she is maimed, later killed. McTeague flees and in off all places Death Valley meets Marcus again. Things can now be settled once and for all..<br />The book, though over a century old, is still very readable. The main theme seems to be greed, in fact a movie was made long ago called Greed, based on this novel. Set in San Francisco everyone is greedy and people even kill for money, everyone is suspicious that they are keeping secrets and are not telling everyone about the money they really possess. Greed leeds in the end to death. Also in Death Valley...	2004-05-13

Love that sometimes started at a very early age.<br />The timelins is sometimes difficult to follow, but that makes it more interesting to read.

There are more stories about him that have become myth but are not really true. Therefore this book is worth reading.<br />It chronicles his entire life from Alabama to Chicago and Arizona where he died in March 1980. Important figures in his life, important events etc. And of course his great feats at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin are mentioned. After this, his athletic career goes downhill and he enters in too many jobs, some good, some really bad. It is kinda sad to read bout all off them.<br />He was a conservative man and did not want to know of the Civil Rights movement in the 60's and 70's which made him clash with the newer black athletes.<br />On a darker side: his sexual escapades and troubles with the IRS are also mentioned. To me however this book seems far, it gives a balanced view of his life and is also very good to read. His friendship with a German athlete alone is a very nice but sad story, since his friend dies in 1944.<br />This story seems to me more to the truth than all the myths we hear about him, read it!	2004-05-08

The story about the boar's tusks is amazing. One of the last stories is about all the men before they start fighting, they talk about their time in San Francisco, for most the last place they were in the US.<br />It's a lot different than his others books, especially a lot thinner. It's magically written and sometimes heartbreaking.	2004-04-28

Half way through the season the Yankees lead the Red Sox by at least ten games but the Sox make an amazing comeback. The last game of the season will decide who will play the Dodgers in the World Series....<br />Besides being a beautiful account of the 1949 season it is also a nice biography of all the players involved. An ailing Joe DiMaggio, a young Yogi Berra, a brilliant Williams and Kinder <br />and Doerr. Great names from a great era.<br />With this book Halberstam again has shown that in America serious historians can also write about baseball, America's national pasttime.	2004-04-26

Veneme pays great detail to pretty much all the aspects of life in this frontier town. The dress, indian relations, healthcare, poor care, trade, important people. It gives a very good insight into how life was lived in the 17th century in both Holland and New Netherlands.<br />the detail and conciseness is also what is the matter with this book. It's good to use as reference and to look for things mentioned before, but because of the many details it is not always easy to get an overall view. The research done was great (it's a dissertation) but makes it at times unreadable. There are for example over 120 pages of notes in the back of the book.<br />It's a very good example of total-history, very interesting to get a good view of life in that age, but not something you would pleasantly read.	2004-04-26

When Armstrong first started riding his style was attacking and funny, though not always very smart. He got better at tactics and started to race better. Then all of a sudden he was gone from the newspapers, having been diagnozed with cancer. <br />This book is a fascinating account about how his career evolved, became pro and was diagnozed. And of course how he got back and won the Tour de France, the sports hardest race.<br />His fight against cancer is something which is a big and important part of this book. People who have never been around cancer patients and never read about but like cycling or sports will have a chace to read about what it is like, it opened my eyes.<br />it may also give people who don't know a lot about the sport a good insight in how it really works.

It's the story of Angela and her sister Virginia, who is blacker than Angela. The story follows the life of Angela and who no one really knows she is black and how she doesn't act upon it.

Through personal interviews we also know that President Clinton was very knowledgable about the threat.<br />There is also a nice chapter on Iraq and their programs during the 80s and 90s and the role the US played in this.<br />They have been given documents by the Pentagon and the White House, so you are never really sure if they can write absolutely free, but it's worth reading as a good book on bio terrorism, a not so visible threat	2004-04-24

For more advanced readers it is also very interesting, it is especially better than any other book on this subject, it makes the whole process clearer than in a standard history book. It also gives a great explenation of the men who were involved.

Cancer stays with a person for ever.<BR>His relationships with other cancer patients are emotional and gripping and is also shows he was the lucky one.<br />This book stands out from other books about cycling, it is very personal and not just about baseball but also about life in general. <BR>He also explains some things that had happened in the Tours, his historic ride towards Mt Ventoux with the late Marco Pantani, his fall and Jan Ulrichs' fall.

It feels like in the beginning of the book we have one big white sheet of paper and we have to get our pencils out and start drawing. The first chapters give us some sense about how Europe looked but with the chapters on the Travels of Discovery (Cook for example) we can draw more lines of the coastal areas. When in the 18th century entire countries are mapped the map becomes clearer and clearer. With the coming of computers the pencil lines could now be drawn with black ink.<br />Even for those not really interested in the History of Maps this book is amazing.

It is about the War Years and the Presidency of FDR. It shows how from a underdeveloped nation concerning a war machinery it started to produce more airplanes, weapons, ships and tanks etc. than any nation in the world and which helped the West to win the war.<BR>The accounts of the bug summits in Casablanca, Teheran and Yalta are fascinating. Especially concerning Yalta, where the faith of the world and the faith of the president were both decided. The world would have peace soon, FDR would die days after the summit.<br />But besides this big international political themes, politics inside the US is also addressed, especially the war industry and the role of black Americans and women in the war effort. This is done without it being something a historian should answer becase he has too, here it is really well done. In this all the role of Eleanor Roosevelt is highlighted.<br />Another theme through the book is FDR's affair and Eleanor's reaction to it. I won't say too much, but this is also worth reading about. This is the best book about the Roosevelts in the white house during the war I have ever read. It deservidly got the Pulitzer Prize.	2004-02-10

We do however see some names back in this history that can also be seen in New York history, especially Stuyvesant and Peter Minuit. He plays a double role, first as an employee of the West Indian Company, later as an employee of the Swedes, who also played a part in the history of the Delaware Region.<br />The rest of the book is like many other books about 17th century America. Hard living, frontier life, slow trade and permanent fights with the Indians<br />For those of you interesting in exploration it is very interesting. Weslager notes often how the countryside were described and how maps were made. These maps are important and even an entire capital and how topography was named by the Dutch. <br />For those of you from Delaware and people interested in Dutch settlers in 17th century America this book is one to look out for. Unfortunately it seems to be pretty rare.	2004-01-19

It is the first colume of a 3 part series which also includes 'Revolutionary New England' and 'New England in the Republic'.<br />It deals mostly with the different forms of government that have existed in this period, from the Puritan town meetings, through the charters, oligarchies, theocracies, back under direct English control and the forming of the states. Between it the different wars against the Indians and the French are mentioned. It is very good in desribing how different people have played important roles.<br />I have not read volumes 2 and 3 yet but will definitely look for them. it is a good read for people who want to know more about the governmental processes in pre-Revolutionary America.	2004-01-15

Besides being interesting to read it also might open your eyes about certain ideas we might have had about religion and society in the 14th century. We read now that everyone slept with everyone, including the priest, the greatest fornicator of them all. Homosexuality is normal and people cried a lot sooner than now. <br />Read it and be amazed about 14th century France, it's different than you always though	2003-12-15
US	49740432	RWACI21L9GJCN	0679762906	960681377	Being Digital	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Fascinating and both too optimistic at the same time.	As an Information Science minor this book has been mentioned many times and I finally had a chance to read it. Even though it is noe 8 years old it still is very useful, his theory of the change from atoms to bits is revolutionary and with it he has named what has been going on: the move to a more and more digital world, whether we like it or not. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the new digital world.<br />There is however one major flaw in this book, although he briefly mentions it in the epilogue. What are the broader societal complications? Nergroponte makes it look like our lives will be perfect and easier. I agree in part, but there are some things to be critical of.<br />Many people in the media seem to be happy with what I would call customized news; you only get the news you want. But what do we want? Doesn't news we hadn't thought of before increase our knowlegde of the world as well? If we only want to read left or rightwing editorials, will we ever understand what the other side thinks? Won't we be molded into a certain way of thinking?<br />There is a funny part about the digitial sister in law, a computer that knows what you like and can therefore tell you which movie you should see. What about moods? surprises? Won't digital machines tell us what to like this way? <br />Read it however, even though you might not like it, it's a classic, if only because of its influence.	2003-12-12
