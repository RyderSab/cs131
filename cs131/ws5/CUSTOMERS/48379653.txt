Lindley shows that quantum theory arose to explain experimental results, for example Stern and Gerlach in 1921 passing a beam of atoms through a graded vertical magnetic field does not result in a graded deflection of the atoms as classical physics would predict. Instead atoms are deflected into two distinct paths, one up and the other down. If, for example, the 'up' path beam of atoms is then passed through another vertical magnet, as expected it would not be split but be deflected further upwards. But, if the 'up' path beam is then passed through a horizontal magnet, left and right path beams emerge, and if, for example, the 'left' path beam is then passed through a vertical magnet, even though it originated from the 'up' path beam, it will split into distinct 'up' and 'down' paths again. Quantum theory explains this experiment by saying that an atom's magnetic alignment is indeterminate until actually measured, and the two possible outcomes having equal probability of occurring depend on the direction of the magnetic field used for the measurement. Quantum theory's uncertainty principle says that you can't know both the up/down and the left/right magnetic properties of the atoms, thus once you measure the left/right magnetic properties, the up/down magnetic properties become indeterminate. Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation emerged over the following decade declaring that measurement defines quantities that otherwise would be indefinite, ie, it is the measurement that makes the atom, for example, 'up' - the atoms are not in 'up', 'down', 'right', 'left' states or pre-states waiting for an observer to observe them, as would be the case in classical physics. Quantum theory implying that physical quantities don't take on a practical reality until an observer makes a measurement disturbed Einstein who once in gest asked a colleague if &quot;he really believed that the Moon exists only when you look at it.&quot; At the end of the book, Lindley shows that quantum mechanics is not that strange. Although not proven yet, study of complicated interacting systems imply that decoherence occurs such that quantum superpositions of macroscopic states do not occur in practice, ie, the moon exists whether we look at it or not.	2000-11-27
US	48379653	R13GA1D7VTZSSN	0878934634	20730792	Molecular Evolution	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Serious molecular evolution	The general reader who has already read some other  references on molecular methods will find this reference to be a reasonable to read yet fairly detailed, comprehensive overview of molecular methods used to discern evolutionary history. The reference begins with the fundamentals of gene structure and function, population genetics, and evolutionary changes in DNA sequences. The use of molecular methods to determine phylogenetic relationships between organisms is then discussed. Molecular clocks are discussed as well. Gene duplication is then discussed. This has been an important mechanism for generating new genes in the evolution of life on Earth. As well, duplication of portions of genes and subsequent 'exon shuffling' or 'domain shuffling', allows the emergence of proteins with new or improved functions. Concerted evolution, the phenomenon that DNA sequences of species evolve so that DNA sequences of the organism maintain similarities to each other, often being more similar internally than with homologous DNA sequences from related species, is then discussed. Gene conversion recombination and unequal crossing over are given as mechanisms for the phenomenon of concerted evolution. Transposable genetic elements are then discussed. Although there is controversy with regards to the effect that mobile genes have had on the evolution of life, they show that the genome is not a static structure, but is susceptible to evolutionary changes. Genome organization is then discussed. It is interesting to note that genome sizes of different bacteria is discontinuous, suggesting that genome duplication occurred in a variety of lineages, especially so 1.8 billion years ago when oxygen appeared in the atmosphere. The variation in genome size of eukaryotes is even greater than in bacteria, from 9 million base pairs in some fungi to 670,000 million base pairs in some diatoms (for reference, the genome size of E. coli bacteria is 4.7 million base pairs, that of humans is 3400 millionbase pairs), although the amniotes (ie, reptiles, birds and mammals) show much less variation in genome size. These results indicate that genome size itself only offers potential for complexity, as well as the implication that much of eukaryotic DNA does not code for anything. Other results also show that large amounts of eukaryotic DNA consists of repetitive segments. Mechanisms for the variation in eukaryotic DNA observed include genome duplication (although polyploidy is rare in animals reproducing via sex), chromosome duplications, transpositions, unequal crossing-over, and DNA amplification. The final chapter considers the selectionist-neutralist debate. Selectionists have a neo-Darwinian view of evolution, ie, there is genetic variability in the population which is changed by natural selection. The neutralists view evolution as being driven more by the rate of mutation than by selection.	2000-11-27

Certain features of the dinoflagellates' DNA organization and replication differ from other eukaryotes and are closer to prokaryotes, thus raising the possibility of the dinoflagellates as intermediately evolved organisms between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina has eukaryotic features such as histones, nucleosomes, spindle, etc. Thus, the features of other dinoflagellates are most probably a divergence from standard eukaryotic features that occurred over their billions of years of existence. In fact, evolutionary trees based on 5S RNA sequences analyzed in 1981 indicate that dinoflagellates emerged after fungi, the latter having full eukaryotic features.	2000-11-27

However, continued research found exceptions to the genetic code. For example, in the mitochondria of echinoderms 'AAA' does not code for lysine but instead for the amino acid asparagine. This reference discusses the codon capture theory and how such evolution of the very fundamental genetic code could occur. In the echinoderm mitochondrial 'AAA' example, its ancestral tRNA-lysine had an anticodon that translated both 'AAA' and 'AAG' to lysine, which is correct according to the standard genetic code. Due to selective pressure of having a genome higher in content of G-C nucleotide pairs, the 'AAA' codon gradually was replaced by 'AAG' until the 'AAA' codon disappeared. In the standard genetic code asparagine is coded for by similar codons, 'AAU' and 'AAC'. Years later, as evolution continued, one day 'AAA' was 'recaptured' to be used as another code for the asparagine amino acid. This short, easy to read book shows that the genetic code is not an arbitrary theoretical construct, but is also subject to evolutionary pressures. Readers that are suspicious of phylogenetic representations of the evolution of life, ie, the splitting of eukaryotes, archaebacteria and eubacteria from the common ancestor billions of years ago, and the myriad of branchings since, may also want to review this reference to see how the DNA code in modern organisms can be used to infer branchings that occurred many millions of years ago.	2000-11-27

Bullock's most interesting works, reprinted and discussed, somewhat. For example, the article by Perkel, D.H., Schulman, J.H., Bullock, T.H., Moore, G.P. and Segundo, J.P., Pacemaker Neurons: Effects of Regularly Spaced Synaptic Input, Science, vol. 145, pp. 61-63, July 3, 1964, is reprinted here. Subthreshold oscillatory potentials have been hypothesized to generate a temporal neuronal coding. If an IPSP (inhibitory signal) is present then the time interval to reach threshold should be longer, while if an EPSP (excitatory signal) is present then the time interval to reach threshold should be shorter. Experiments in the sea slug and crayfish confirm these predictions. It is noted that small changes in the rate of input excitation or inhibition can significantly change the output pattern.	2000-11-27

However, this book begins by pointing out that in various sensory systems there appears to be sparse temporal neural coding, ie, the timing of action potentials transmits information, and in fact does so quite efficiently. A mathematical basis is built up throughout the reference in order to support these claims. However, the general reader who has prior reading of other neurobiological references listed above and below, will nonetheless find the descriptive portions of this reference informative and reasonable to read. If a neuron can fire 100 spikes (ie, action potentials) per second, then it would appear that many biological phenomena are coded by no more than one or two spikes. For example, bat echolocation occurs on a time scale of 5-20 milliseconds (enough time for coding by a maximum of one or two spikes). For example, in the fly, movements across its visual field can cause it to generate a flight torque in less than 30 milliseconds (ie, enough time for only a few spikes). For example, in the rat hippocampus signaling about position is performed on the order of one or two spikes per neuron. The fact that single spikes are carrying information in these examples indicates that at least in some parts of the nervous system, a temporal neural coding exists. As well, the issue of neuron reliability is considered in detail. Traditionally, it has been considered that individual neurons are unreliable (for example, repeated presentations of the same sensory stimulus does not cause a sensory neuron to generate the same spike train each time), and that it is only in the context of the large network of neurons of the nervous system that perception is reliable (for example, an animal running through the woods at a high speed does not collide with trees). However, it is not so clear how the different spike trains generated each time by the sensory neuron in response to the same stimulus should really be quantified, and there is much evidence showing individual neurons to be quite reliable. For example, in human vision in very dim light individual photosensitive sensory neurons are detecting single photons. The fact that the many neural circuits after the photosensitive sensory neuron add little noise to the sensory neuron output, indicates that the neural computation involved must be very reliable. The fact that hyperacuity (ability to detect sensory stimuli beyond, albeit generally just somewhat beyond before it is truly impossible to do so, the threshold of physical reliability) exists also indicates the existence of a very reliable neural computation. For example, echolocating bats resolving jitter in the echoes on an order of 10 nanoseconds, or weakly electric fish resolving signal shifts on the order of 100s of nanoseconds, or human observers with a theoretical visual acuity threshold of 0.01 degree able to discriminate 0.002 degrees. Most of this reference analyzes single trains of spikes (ie, the action potentials being generated by a single neuron), and shows clearly that very few spikes can represent very precise computations. The last chapter of this book considers briefly more recent research on spike trains of multiple neurons.	2000-11-27

In 1958, Cornell psychologist Frank Rosenblatt proposed the 'perceptron', one of the first neural networks to become widely known. A retina sensory layer projected to an association layer made up of threshold logic units which in turn connected to the third layer, the response layer. If two groups of patterns are linearly separable then the perceptron network works well in learning to classify them in separate classes. In this reference, Minsky and Papert show that assuming a diameter-limited sensory retina, a perceptron network could not always compute connectedness, ie, determining if a line figure is one connected line or two separate lines. Extrapolating the conclusions of this reference to other sorts of neural networks was a big setback to the field at the time of this reference. However, it was subsequently shown that having an additional 'hidden' layer in the neural network overcame many of the limitations. This reference figures so prominently in the field of neural networks, and is often referred to in modern works. But of even greater significance, the history of the perceptron demonstrates the complexity of analyzing neural networks. Before this reference, artificial neural networks were considered terrific, after this reference limited, and then in the 1980s terrific again. But at the time of this writing, it is realized that despite physiological plausibility, artificial neural networks do not scale well to large or complex problems that brains can easily handle, and artificial neural networks as we know them may actually be not so terrific.	2000-11-27

Although Albert Einstein published in 1917 a paper discussing stimulated and spontaneous emission of light, and although technology such as discharge tubes (eg, neon lights) were available at the time, it was not until 1960 that Theodore Maiman at Hughes Aircraft Corporation, demonstrated the first laser, albeit a ruby rod laser. If an electron in an atom is put into an excited state, then eventually that electron will drop to a more stable, lower energy state and emit a photon of light in the process. Einstein noted that a photon of the same energy as one that would be emitted could stimulate the atom to drop the electron to the lower energy state and emit the photon. If the technology is used to raise electrons into a higher state and then allow a chain reaction whereby released photons stimulate other atoms to release photons and so on, then laser light results. For example, we can pass an electric current through a neon tube to excite the electrons of the neon atoms into higher energy levels. Doing so results in a neon light-- electrons spontaneously drop to lower levels and photons are spontaneously emitted. However, if we then put mirrors at the end of the neon tube, then a photon reflecting off one of the mirrors back down the axis of the tube will stimulate another excited neon atom to emit a photon, and now there will be two photons travelling in the same direction, and will stimulate more neon atoms which will release more photons, and there will be more and more photons travelling together as the chain reaction proceeds. If one of the mirrors is partially reflecting and allows a small percent of the photons hitting it to pass out, then out of this mirror will emerge a laser beam.	2000-11-26

Introduces the general reader to a number of topics in modern mathematics. This book is popular undoubtedly because of the weird lifestyle Erdos lived, and the fascination we have for genius, assuming, and having it confirmed here, that they are not like us. However, I found this book most interesting, because it made think about what truth is. Erdos, like many other mathematicians, believe that mathematics, unlike any other field of knowledge, represents absolute truths. Erdos used to say that God had a 'Book' of these truths, ie, these mathematical proofs, and the highest compliment Erdos could give to a colleague was that a discovered proof was &quot;straight from the Book.&quot; However, perhaps mathematics does not derive from pure truths, but rather, by one microsecond of age, the mathematics of the Universe derives directly from the properties of the Universe. Something to think about, anyway.	2000-11-26

For the reader with a basic knowledge of neurophysiology, this reference provides a more detailed, yet easy to read, overview of the synapse. The role of calcium and the mechanism of the release of neurotransmitter is considered. Ionotropic receptors where activation directly affects the ionic channel and thus mediate a fast synaptic response, are considered, including Ach, glycine, GABA(A), glutamate and serotonin 5HT-3 receptors. Metabotropic receptors, which are generally linked to G-proteins and which activate intracellular second messengers which in turn affect ionic channels, often located at a distance, and thus mediate a slow synaptic response, are considered. Synaptic plasticity, including the changes that occur with learning (particularly in Aplysia), is then considered. Morphological plasticity such as increased numbers of synapses, is also considered. Different neurotrophins required for neuron survival, including NGF, BDNF and NT-3, and then the regulation of developing synapses, are considered.	2000-11-26

This reference is readable and suitable for the interested general reader. While an introductory cognitive science or psychology textbook covers a broader range of material, this reference, restricted to limited aspects of memory, has the advantage of giving the reader a better feel for different approaches (cognitive scientific, psychological, neuroanatomical, physiological, and neuropsychological) towards an understanding of brain functions. 'Procedural memory' optimizes various processors throughout the brain for the stimuli they encounter. 'Declarative memory', dependent on the hippocampal system, is a relational representation of learning experiences, is very accessible and can be easily expressed, and binds outputs of the various neocortical processor outputs (eg, high level visual, auditory, limbic, somesthetic, etc) and olfactory outputs converging on the hippocampal system. Olfactory, frontal, parietal and temporal cortical areas send projections to the superficial entorhinal cortex. In turn, from the entorhinal cortex, the perforant pathway projects to the dentate gyrus (where there are association fibers between neurons), which in turn projects mossy fibers to the CA3 hippocampal region (where there are association fibers between neurons), which in turn projects Schaffer collaterals to the CA1 hippocampal region (which also receives a more direct input from the entorhinal cortex) which then projects to the deep entorhinal cortex, which in turn projects back to the source olfactory, frontal, parietal and temporal cortical areas. The hippocampal subiculum also receives projections from both the CA1 region and the entorhinal cortex, and also projects to the deep entorhinal cortex which then in turn projects back to the cortical areas from which the hippocampal system received projections from. The fornix pathway connects the hippocampal system with subcortical structures such as thalamus, hypothalamus and brainstem nuclei. Glutamate NMDA and non-NMDA neurotransmitter receptors on the same dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons provide a conjunction mechanism - the NMDA channel will open if neurotransmitter is received AND there is sufficient membrane depolarization (ie, in response to another input), and will result in long-term potentiation LTP. However, it is noted that in particular, LTP is best induced if there are high frequency bursts of the stimuli, repetition of these bursts at frequencies corresponding to the theta rhythm, and activation of hippocampal neurons at the peak of the dentate theta rhythm. Electrophysiological recordings of rodent CA1 neurons show that hippocampal neurons encode relationships between environmental and internal cues, in particular, being sensitive to specific locations in the environment during spatial explorations. While the hippocampal system binds together outputs of many neocortical (and olfactory and subcortical) processors and thus allows declarative memories to be reconstructed from features in these processors, the hippocampal system is not the permanent storage site of such memories. For example, in cases of hippocampal system damage, remote memories are not strongly affected. It is thus proposed that the hippocampal system allows access to the various processors so that features of declarative memories can somehow be bound together in a more permanent manner.	2000-11-26

The first verse of William Blake's Auguries of Innocence appears in Bronowski, as homage to Ludwig Boltzmann: &quot; To see a World in a Grain of Sand, And a Heaven in a Wild flower, Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand, And Eternity in an hour....&quot; William Blake was born in London in 1757. He attended drawing school and thereafter eked out a very modest existence as an engraver and artist. He was not able to find a publisher so in 1789 he himself engraved and published Songs of Innocence and The Book of Thel. Blake died in 1827. Blake was one of many 'romantic poets' of that epoch. Auden and Pearson point out that the romantic definition of man appears towards the end of the eighteenth century. The divine element that man possesses is not power nor free will of reason, but self-consciousness. Man can see possibilities, he can imagine states of existence other than they are.	2000-11-26

I found the articles concerning the fish telencephalon most useful. For example, J.P.C. de Bruin writes about the Telencephalon and Behavior in Teleost Fish. This article discusses various experimental results concerning the function of the fish telencephalon. Not all functions of the telencephalon are olfactory. Fish with the telencephalon removed are less likely to form schools. Fish with telencephalonic lesions have deficits in nestbuilding. Telencephalonic lesions also affect aggressive behavior and sexual behavior. G.E.Savage writes about the Fish Telencephalon and Its Relation to Learning. This article discusses various experimental results concerning the function of the fish telencephalon. Removal of the telencephalon does not cause persistent changes in the swimming or in the feeding (of detritus on the bottom of the tank which is tasted more so than smelled) of the fish. Ablated fish could in fact be trained to swim to a food holder on a screen, with good results. However, the telencephalon is essential in olfaction, as shown in experiments whereby blinded minnows could find olfactory stimuli, but ablation of the telencephalon prevented this behavior (although, discrimination with resect to gustatory stimuli still remained intact). As well, it is found that ablated goldfish would ignore a bang stimulus on the tank, and less likely to seek shelter in hidden corners of the tank. However, fear still remains in the ablated goldfish, as evident in classical conditioning experiments. In certain learning experiments, the performance of the ablated fish suggests short-term memory deficits. As well, ablated fish were much slower to learn to find their way to food through a simple maze. Since telencephalon ablation does not eliminate, but rather reduces, learned behavior, the function of the forebrain may be due to nonspecific 'arousal', although other evidence argues against the telencephalon in arousal. Perhaps the telencephalon is required to form a match for incoming data, with failure to find a match causing a complex series of responses by the reticular formation.	2000-11-26

However, to be truly appreciated by the general reader, a review of high school mechanics prior to reading will be most advantageous. Einstein shows how the theory of relativity arose because of a need to consider the real world, ie, &quot;..the same light ray cannot move with respect to all inertial systems with the same velocity c...it turns out, however, that this contradiction is only an apparent one which is based essentially on the prejudice about the absolute character of time or rather of the simultaneity of distant events.&quot; It is interesting that after Einstein's short essays on relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy in the above book, his 1936 essay &quot;Physics and Reality&quot; follows.	2000-11-26

Whether physics can distinguish between past and future is then considered, and although the 1965 perspective is somewhat dated, the concepts nonetheless remain valid. Quantum mechanics is then presented with imagination and enthusiasm.

Vertebrates are proposed as a model for studying evolution, noting that they are a monophyletic group, have sexual reproduction, share a similar body plan, and most importantly have an excellent fossil record.

Atkin writes, &quot;...elephants, and things resembling elephants, will in due course be found roaming through the countryside...the details of the processes involved in evolution are fascinating, but they are unimportant: competing, replicating molecules with time on their hands will inevitably evolve.&quot;  While this may be an overly simplistic view of the conditions necessary to evolve creatures as complex as elephants, the purpose of Atkin's book is to try to simplify everything as much as possible so that the creation of space, of dimensions, of time and of matter from nothing can be understood. Atkin indeed feels he has accomplished these goals, as is written on the last page, &quot;...fundamental science may be almost at an end, and might be completed within a generation...that is not to say that science as a whole need ever sleep. There are extremely difficult and important questions, such as those concerning the details of biological function...when we have dealt with the values of the fundamental constants by seeing that they are unavoidably so, and have dismissed them as irrelevant, we shall have arrived at complete understanding. Fundamental science then can rest. We are almost there. Complete knowledge is just within our grasp. Comprehension is moving across the face of the Earth, like the sunrise.&quot; This reference is easy to read, and introduces the reader to complex subjects in cosmology and physics. While the reader may view Atkin's theory of creation with some speculation, the language of this reference is poetic and convincing.	2000-11-26

Volume 2 is especially useful with chapters on its endocrine system, digestive system, osmoregulatory system, circulatory system, respiratory system, central nervous system and immunological system. Like other vertebrates, the lamprey has a pituitary gland in the ventral diencephalon at the base of the third ventricle and a hypothalamic neurosecretory system. The lamprey has a pineal complex above the habenula. In protochordates there is an endostyle, a groove along the length of the pharynx floor. The larval lamprey has a more complex endostyle, which at metamorphosis becomes the thyroid gland. The lamprey liver is similar to that of gnathostomes. However, neither the  lamprey nor the hagfish have a pancreas that is morphologically isolated from the intestine. As well, there is no stomach, a feature which only appears in the gnathostomes. The interrenal of the lamprey is likely homologous with the adrenocortical cells of higher vertebrates. While hagfish is marine only, with body fluids similar in composition to seawater, the lamprey have both freshwater and marine phases, an have an internal fluid composition hypo-osmotic to seawater, but hyperosomotic to fresh water. Both the lamprey and the hagfish have kidneys. As in other gnathostomes, the lamprey has a heart leading to the gills which leads to arteries to capillaries to veins back to the heart. There is no lymphatic system, but a system of venous sinuses exist which communicate with the blood vessels. The lamprey heart receives nerve fibers from the vagus nerve. No thymus, spleen or lymph nodes are found in the lamprey, (but are found in gnathastomes), although lymphoid cells exist in lampreys in a primitive protothymus, primitive proto-spleen and possibly a proto-bone marrow. As well, the blood of lampreys contains good numbers of leucocytes. The eyes of the lamprey are vertebrate in character, although the retina is not well differentiated and accommodation is via muscles outside of the globe. The auditory capsule is divided into two chambers lined with cilia with diverticula forming anterior and posterior vertical canals of the labyrinth. The lamprey has a lateral line system as well as innervated skin cells. Unlike other vertebrates, the lamprey has a single, median olfactory organ. The lamprey central nervous system is vertebrate in character, including a rudimentary cerebellum. More details on the lamprey central nervous system, however, can be found in other comparative neuroanatomical references.	2000-11-26

This reference, will greatly aid in the transition. Explanation of how physical actions such as gravity and electromagnetism are transmitted at a distance has provoked intense debates over the centuries. The electromagnetic field and continuous ether of Thomson and Maxwell, provided a cause for actions at a distance. In Einstein's special theory of relativity the ether was removed. In Einstein's general theory of relativity, spacetime is shown to depend on the gravitational fields. Gravitational fields are considered to be a geometrical programme of field theory, and are discussed in the first part of this reference. The middle part of this reference then considers the quantum field programme. The last part of this reference then considers the gauge field programme whereby gauge potentials can explain fundamental interactions. The motivated reader will also find this reference useful for introduction to many concepts omitted in most introductory physics texts. For example, in describing how Maxwell derived his wave equations, the ability to reformulate Newtonian mechanics in terms of a Lagrangian approach is noted.	2000-11-26

Genetic algorithms refer to computer programs that 'evolve' in ways similar to biological organisms. 'Natural selection' specifies the features of the solution to look for, strings of binary numbers (or other similar structures) are mated, with the combination of strings containing partial solutions often producing the most 'fit' results. Generation after generation of this process continues towards the 'evolution' of the desired features. Although this reference is quite long, it is quite readable, and can be shortened significantly by omitting a number of subsections as well as chapters not essential to the core concepts, as well as the detailed appendices. This reference shows that a variety of problems from different fields can be solved in terms of a computer program, of which genetic programming can be the means to find one or more such valid computer programs. It is relevant in that genetic programming is another way to effect computation, as well as providing insight with respect to evolution in nature.	2000-11-26

A wide varieties of views are supported, but a number of conclusions are nonetheless formulated. Gisln's view of the carpoid as an echinoderm with chordate affinities is considered more correct than Jefferies' view of the carpoid as a chordate with echinoderm affinities. Recent molecular evidence supports chordates diverging from (echinoderms and hemichordates), and within the chordates, urochordates diverging from (cephalochordates and craniates). Larval paedomorphosis as the mechanism originating the vertebrates is unlikely, and the sessility of tunicates is probably a derived trait. While strong homologies between homeobox genes and organ systems in both arthropods and vertebrates are acknowledged, it is noted that molecular methods set deuterostome phyla clearly apart from protostome phyla, suggesting the direct ancestry of the vertebrates is not from the arthropods. Molecular methods also indicate that the amphioxus is not a degenerate vertebrate, but essentially a primitive one, and elaboration of its features leads to the emergence of the vertebrate head.	2000-11-26

The reader is introduced to organic chemistry and the workings of an E. coli, to show how difficult it is to get chemical systems to produce products such as RNA or DNA, and yet, how very complex a simple cell is. It is suggested that perhaps instead of thinking classically as DNA as the controlling element and core of the cell, ie, DNA-&gt; RNA-&gt; proteins, think from a supply perspective, ie, at the core of the cell are carbon molecules such as carbon dioxide -&gt; subcomponents -&gt; amino acids -&gt; nucleotides &amp; DNA, ie, DNA is not at the core, but is most outward layer, and probably evolved the last too. It is proposed that the ultimate ancestor of life on Earth did not use RNA or DNA as a genetic system, but with evolution, a 'genetic takeover' occurred whereby the now-familiar RNA and DNA systems emerged. The phenomenon of self-assembly of molecules, from soap bubbles to the folding of proteins to the formation of crystals is discussed. This leads to the proposal that the very early genes on Earth were in fact 'crystal genes'. The crystallization of supersaturated solutions is discussed, and it is noted how small crystals cause 'reproduction' and 'growth' of more crystal from the supersaturated solution. Geological processes on Earth produce huge amounts of clay minerals. Crystals all have defect structures, with the result no two crystals are identical. The first 'lifeforms' on Earth were inorganic crystal-based entities that reproduced and grew as such. Since the supply perspective of the cell suggests that the biochemical structure is built up from carbon dioxide molecules, it is proposed that via photosynthesis the mineral lifeforms started producing organic molecules. It is noted that iron atoms are common in most clays, and could have 'caught' light and in conjunction with various patterns of clay layers,have synthesized organic molecules. Eventually the clay apparatus of the primitive lifeforms was replaced with RNA-like molecules, amino acids, membrane layers, and so on, and the DNA/RNA/protein form of life we are familiar with emerged. The seven clues referred to in the title of this reference are as follows: 1. Evolution can only occur when there is replication of some sort of genetic information. 2. DNA and RNA are difficult molecules to fabricate, far removed from the core of biochemical pathways. 3. To make an arch of stones needs scaffolding, and similarly, to originate the form of life we are now familiar with required some sort of scaffolding.  4. No particular fiber in a rope has to stretch from one end of the rope to the other end as long as they are adequately intertwined, and similarly, the lifeforms based on inorganic crystalline genes could have gradually evolved into lifeforms based on organic molecular genes.  5. A primitive machine must be easy to make from available materials and work with little fuss, while in the case of an advanced machine, the emphasis is on working well, and often it may be complex to assemble.  6. Crystals put themselves together and could have easily formed a 'low-tech' genetic material, unlike the complicated control required of organic molecules.  7. The Earth produces huge amounts of clay minerals.	2000-11-26

Jerison in this book, ie, Paleoneurology and the Evolution of Mind. Brain weight is plotted against body weight for living and archaic mammals and reptiles. Brain weight tends to vary with 2/3rd power of body weight, with vertical displacements for mammals and again for primates. Living reptiles show similar brain weights as archaic ones. There is a four-fold increase in brain size from archaic reptile to archaic mammal, and then mammalian encephalization holds steady for another 100 million years. In the last 50 million years there is another four-fold increase in brain size from archaic mammals to living mammals. The emergence of improved hearing and smell is postulated as the reason for an enlarged brain in early mammals over their reptile ancestors.	2000-11-26

As is pointed out several times, while air-breathing fishes are often considered as the fishes which evolved the ability to breathe in the air, and then invaded the land to evolve into the land vertebrates, this is not entirely correct. The fish lung evolved in the ancestor to both the ray-finned fishes and the lobe-finned fishes, many millions of years prior to transition to land. In the Upper Devonian one of many different fishes with lungs, a group belonging the lobe-finned fishes, became amphibious and eventually evolved into the tetrapods. While the fish lung was conserved and exists in the modern lungfish, in the bulk of fishes, such as modern teleosts, the fish lung evolved into a non-respiratory gas bladder, used largely for buoyancy control. Nonetheless, for more than three hundred different species of modern freshwater, shallow fishes, air breathing is a valuable mechanism to cope with hypoxic water conditions, and was conserved or re-evolved.	2000-11-26

Any modern work of science is in turn based on the work of many thousands of scientists. If one considers that the work that these scientists (and other researchers) produced is in turn based on the work of a great number of other researchers, then the number of individuals that contributed to the rational base for a scientific work, is truly an impressive figure. The reference section usually only effectively credits only a small percentage of these workers, with a bias somewhat towards those researchers published in the most widely available and recent journals. This reference, the Random House Webster's Dictionary of Scientists, like other works of this nature, provides a more comprehensive coverage of different scientists' works. But again, even with its 1800 biographies, it too covers only a small percentage of the workers that contributed to mankind's scientific knowledge at the time of this reference.

Ice ages are given at 2.3 billion years B.P., 950 million years B.P., 820 - 730 million years B.P., 640 - 580 million years B.P., brief glaciation at 430 million years B.P. (immediately followed by evolution of land plants), warming of Earth by decrease of reflection sunlight because of plant cover, approx. 300 million years B.P. glaciation probably due to continental drift of largest continents along paths near poles, then warm climate through the Mesozoic and into the Cenozoic until 30 million years B.P. with glaciations periodically until present.	2000-11-26

Parallel processing in varying degrees extends back even to Babbage who processed the digit sum and carry in parallel. In the 1950s various multiprocessors became available, essentially autonomous processors coupled by hardware and by synchronization software, such as the U.S. National Bureau of Standards PILOT. However, as is pointed out later in this reference in describing more recent multiprocessors, its is noted that multiprocessors usually share a global memory. In the 1960s appeared various multifunction processors, such as the CDC 6600, whereby a single instruction stream controlled independent processing units where each unit only performed a few specific functions. In the late 1960s dataflow processors such as the IBM 360/91 appeared, whereby several instructions were dispatched into queues of waiting instructions where instructions waited until the required data or functional unit was available. Also appearing at this time were array processors whereby many equivalent processing units were under the control of a single control unit, such as the ILLIAC IV 64-element array processor. In 1972 emerged the Texas Instruments Advanced Scientific Computer ASC which has both multiprocessing and pipelining. A pipelined processor divides each processing unit into different stages which can operate on different data simultaneously. Parallel processor taxonomies generally consider machines which are SISD (single instruction, single data stream; hence usually reflective of a conventional uniprocessor), SIMD (single instruction, multiple data stream; eg, an array processor; as well, pipelined processors are considered SIMD), MISD (multiple instruction, single data stream), and MIMD (multiple instruction, multiple data stream; eg, multiprocessors).	2000-11-26

The reference begins with a discussion of the reference frame we use to observe stars in the sky, for example, the celestial meridian and the celestial equator. Various telescopes are then discussed. The physics of a star's motions and gravity is discussed, as well as the spectrum it emits. The life cycles of stars are discussed, with attention to supergiants, supernovae, pulsars, and black holes. The reference concludes with a cosmological perspective of stars. Of interest, since only helium, deuterium and lithium were made at the start of the Big Bang, we should be able to observe some (even just one) very old stars that contain no higher metals. But, no metal-free star, even the oldest ones observed, have been found yet. Although there are many reasons to explain this phenomenon, for example, such old stars may no longer remain, it would be reassuring to Big Bang theory if even one metal-free star could be found.	2000-11-26

While on summer vacation at Duino near Trieste, Boltzmann became depressed and committed suicide. It is thought that attacks on his support for the atomic theory contributed to the depression and suicide. While Boltzmann supported the atomic theory of matter, other scientists such as Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald strongly rejected it.	2000-11-26

For example, A. Delsemme writes about The Origin of the Atmosphere and of the Oceans. It is argued that Earth's atmosphere and its oceans, as well as much of the carbon found in its biosphere, was brought to the Earth by comets. Although present-day impacts of comets are modest, in the first billion years, and especially first half billion years, of the Earth's existence, a large bombardment of comets occurred, as reflected by the cratering record observed on the Moon, Mars and Mercury. The cometary delivery of matter would explain the siderophile metals in the Earth's crust, and would explain how an ocean and atmosphere remained despite depletion by large body impacts.	2000-11-26

The reference notes that some 13,000 years ago, all humans were Stone-Age-technology hunter-gatherers, and then considers why different groups of humans developed different types of societies and different levels of technologies, on the different continents. The argument is made that neurobiologically all groups of humans were more or less similar, but that the Eurasians were the most fortunate in living in Eurasia compared to the other continents in terms of plants suitable for domestication, animals for domestication, and the minimum of geographical barriers for the spread of food production techniques and other ideas. Farming and herding allowed larger, more organized societies, and gave their members the opportunity to develop and disseminate writing and technology. As well, these societies, in close relation with their farm animals, evolved over generations immunity to many of the viruses the farm animals spread. The result was that when, some 500 years ago, the Eurasians came in contact with Native Americans, Australians and sub-Saharan Africans, the Eurasian guns, germs and steel swords, allowed the conquer, displacement and/or decimation of these latter inhabitants. In making this argument, this reference describes in easy-to-read language, the spread of humans around the world from pre-history until 11,000 B.C., domestication of wild crops and animals in different parts of the world, the rates of spread of food production in different parts of the world, the evolution of livestock-related germs, the development of writing in different parts of the world, the development of various technologies in different parts of the world, the development of government and organized religion in different parts of the world, the histories of Australia and New Guinea, the history of East Asia, the history of Austronesian expansion, the history ofAfrica, and a comparative history of the Americans and Eurasia. While writing books like this can always be politically touchy, there is much science in this book, and much the reader can take away concerning about how our world ended up the way it did.	2000-11-26

As well, unlike most pharmacology texts, this one does not concentrate on drugs, but rather on the underlying physiology. There is an introduction to neurons, synapses and action potentials. There is an introduction to modern molecular methods. It is interesting to note that in describing molecular cloning methods, the work of J. G. Sutcliffe, R.J. Milner, and F.E. Bloom is reported whereby a cDNA library was prepared from mRNAs from whole rat brain, then it was seen what individual cDNAs hybridized with the mRNAs from rat liver and kidney. Approximately 30,000 of the brain's 50,000 mRNAs were not detected in the liver or kidney, showing that much of the rat's DNA is for neuronal purposes. In the introduction to receptors, it is noted that there about a thousand known receptors to neurotransmitters, hormones and odorants. The introduction to neuromodulators includes the neuronal effects of nitric oxide (thought to be involved in both long-term potentiation LTP and long-term depression LTD; nitric oxide synthase inhibitors will block NMDA receptor activation). The chapter on amino acid neurotransmitters includes excitatory glutamate and aspartate, and inhibitory GABA, glycine, alanine, cystathionine and serine. There are chapters on cholinergic (acetylcholine) and catecholaminergic (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) neurotransmitters. Serotonin and histamine neurotransmitters are considered in detail in the next chapter. There is an introduction to neuroactive peptides, noting that they must be synthesized on ribosomes, then at the smooth endoplasmic reticulum they are put into vesicles in a prohormonal form, and only then transported to the nerve terminals. The book concludes with introductions to the cellular mechanisms involved in learning, and the involvement of neurotransmitters in neurological and psychiatric illnesses.	2000-11-26

The earliest known fossil vertebrate is Sacabambaspis/Arandaspis found in Bolivia/Australia and 470 million years old - head armor, jawless, mouth containing bony parts for scraping the seabottom, lateral eyes, two pineal eyes, gill openings, and only a median and caudal fins. At the end of Ordovician there was a period of glaciation, and then afterwards in the early Silurian there is a large appearance of both jawless and jawed fossil vertebrates - heterostracans (cephalaspids), galeaspids, thelodonts, acanthodians, shark relatives (chondrichthyans), placoderms (jawed &amp; armored), and possibly bony fishes (osteichthyans). In the mid-Silurian tectonic plate movement created mountain ranges that subsequently eroded what became a red sandstone in many areas that were favorable to vertebrate life. In the Devonian fossils are found showing fish evolving into groups that would survive to the present, as well as tetrapods. In the Carboniferous it is found that the cartilaginous fishes and the ray-finned fishes greatly diversify, as well ferns and club-mosses are found around bays and lakes. After the Permian ended, the 'modern' vertebrate world appears in the Triassic and Jurassic - sharks, teleosts, modern amphibians, modern reptiles, birds and mammals. Lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, some ray-finned fish, coelacanths and lungfishes survive relatively unchanged from the emergence of the vertebrates in the Late Palaeozoic. The early vertebrate fossils, along with comparisons of extant vertebrates, are considered in detail. Origins of the vertebrate head and the tetrapod limb are then considered, followed by broader topics in evolution.	2000-11-26

This small volume introduces computers as a file clerk performing his tasks, moves on to show how the 'file clerk' can be built out of simple gates, how the gates can be built out actual transistors, discusses essential issues in computation theory such as computability and Turing machines, and then discusses essential issues in information theory such as data compression. The physics of computing from a thermodynamics context is then considered. If the general reader ignores the gas equations, this chapter is fairly easy to read and enlightening. The next chapter continues with a discussion of quantum mechanical computers. The final chapter discusses how real transistors function at the atomic level and fabrication techniques for real integrated circuits. Lectures given by invited experts on computer science topics such as vision, robots, expert systems, etc, are not included. Although this reference does not discuss alternative architectures for computation, such as the ones found in the brains of animals, this reference is ideal to introduce the motivated general reader to the concept of computation and the techniques used in commercial computers.	2000-11-26

The structural approach considers neural morphology and synaptic connectivity. It is noted that pasterns of reciprocal interaction are common, binding structural units together. The functional approach considers functional decomposition of skills or behavior. Computational neural networks are used in models but are constrained by neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. 'Schemas' are functional entities. The dynamics approach allows analysis of spatiotemporal neural phenomena, and provides another bridge between structure and function. The reference begins with three chapters, each an overview on structure, function and dynamics. Chapters on the olfactory system, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia follow.	2000-11-26

The reference starts by pointing out the significant amount of cellular mechanisms conserved in all forms of life. The concept of 'contingency' is then developed, where it is considered to be the dependence of cellular activities on particular conditions, and its importance in metazoans. This leads to the concept of 'exploratory behavior', where it is considered to be responses of the organism to be more than can be explained by contingent mechanisms. For example, a version of the protozoan Stentor that is only .1% of the usual volume, yet its overall shape, the patterns of its cilia and gullet, are not changed. Plasticity observed in the nervous system is another such example. The concept of 'novelty' is then discussed, largely how new proteins have emerged. Multicellularity and differentiation are then considered, followed by the emergence of various body plans. The concept of developmental flexibility and robustness is considered as the development of the embryo is discussed. Limb buds and neural crest cells are then discussed as sources of evolutionary diversification of the vertebrate body plan. The final chapter of the reference considers the concept of 'evolvability', where it is considered to be the capability of organisms to produce nonlethal, phenotypic variations which natural selection can act upon, and thus allow evolution.	2000-11-26

This reference is a synthesis of the neurobiological literature (indeed, the reference section occupies a third of its pages), but it is nonetheless very readable. The reference starts with neurulation and lineages of nerve cells including the neuroglia. There is then a chapter on the neural crest cells. This is followed by development of axons, dendrites and synapses, including the influence of neurotrophic factors. There is then a chapter on the development of the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex. Morphogenesis of these cortices occurs in three phases - formation and migration of various types of neurons and glia to characteristic positions; forming redundant dendrites and axons, with transient synapses; pruning of dendrites, axons and neurons themselves. The final chapter is on the development of neuronal specificity and neuronal projection maps. Even though a very large percentage of the mammalian genome is expressed exclusively in the nervous system, the genome is still not large enough to specify in detail the interconnections of the developed brain. Rather, it is more parsimonious for the genome to specify programs of histogenesis, migration and various cellular interactions. A neuronal projection map is where one set of neurons projects its axons to another set of neurons such the connections reflect the spatial order of the neurons. Neuronal projection maps are found throughout the nervous system.	2000-11-26

As is pointed out, Copernicus showed that Earth is not the center of the Universe, Newton showed that motions of planets can be explained by simple physical laws, and then Darwin completed this Copernican revolution by showing that origin of new, highly organized forms of life could be explained by similar natural laws, in this case, adaptive variations and natural selection. Evidence for evolution comes from paleontology, comparative anatomy, comparative embryology, comparative ethology (animal behavior), biogeography (geographical distribution of animals), genetics, comparative biochemistry and molecular biology.	2000-11-26

The reference starts of with the precepts of classical cosmology, and then covers a variety of important topics in a coherent fashion. These include the measurements, in particular distances, required to arrive at the Hubble constant, deceleration parameter and omega. The curvature of space and phenomena such as black holes are discussed. Big bang nucleosynthesis and the possibilities for dark matter to close the Universe follow. The isotropic and homogeneous nature of the Universe along with the evolution of stars and galaxies are covered. A nontechnical chapter then discusses the expression of the laws of nature as symmetries, and the transformation and breaking of these symmetries. Models of inflation, from the original theories to chaotic inflationary models, are presented. A discussion of the quantum world and theories of origin for the Universe(s) then follow.

However, besides being simplified, it appears that many of Kauffman's concepts are more refined in this later reference. The thread/button analogy (as the ratio of connecting edges to nodes increases past .5, the size of the largest connected cluster very rapidly increases, much like a phase transition of ice becoming water as the temperature increases through 0 degrees Celsius) is applied to a large collection of chemicals such that when there are a large enough number of catalyzed reactions a web of catalyzed reactions will suddenly emerge. The order given by such autocatalytic chemical sets is then further explored, with the development of simplifying N (number of elements) - K (number of input connections per element) mathematics describing properties of such sets. While the obvious application of this NK mathematics would be the origin of the first cells from the chemical brew of the primordial Earth, much of the remainder of this reference is the application of the NK model to numerous other areas of biology and even economics. The theme of Kauffman's work, &quot;..then life is not a highly improbable chance event, but almost inevitable...&quot;, is opposite of my own. This may possibly be due to the reality that Kauffman's NK-like organization, like many other phenomena, is, within the dynamics of the Universe being considered, a necessary condition, but nowhere close to a sufficient condition, for the emergence of life.	2000-11-26

Interactions between patterns of activity can be at one level be well explained by rules manipulating symbols, but perhaps at a different level can be explained by distributed computation. For example, in 1980 McClelland and Rumelhart propose a distributed model (ie, neural network) to explain the experimental results that it is easier for persons to recognize letters if they form a word than if they make up a nonsense string. Units (ie, neurons) in the lower layer represent letters, and those in the top layer represent specific words. Top-layer units representing words receive excitatory and inhibitory inputs for the letter units (ie, neurons) depending on whether the letter is in the word. The operation of such a model will agree well with many aspects of experimental psychological data. The parallel nature of the mammalian cerebral cortex is then discussed. It is noted that the cortex is parallel from its initial incoming sensory inputs through initial processing to its many topographical maps.	2000-11-26

The first chapter provides an excellent, albeit somewhat technical, introduction to artificial neural networks, and the reader with a background in physics, mathematics or engineering, may actually find this book, in conjunction with a workbook an excellent starting point for learning about neural networks.	2000-11-26

A worthwhile book to anyone interested in this part of mankind's evolution.	2000-11-26

The reference to making watches is an answer to William Paley's argument of last century. Paley noted that if we were to find a watch, we could not say that it randomly came together, much like a rock. The complexity of a watch, and the fact that its parts all function together, indicates that it had a designer. The analogy with lifeforms is thus obvious, ie, how could such complex entities come together randomly. The watch must have had a watchmaker, and similarly, life must have also had a designer. Dawkins argues that the watchmaker of life is evolution, ie, a blind process that does not attempt to specifically create any particular design.	2000-11-26
