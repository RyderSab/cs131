Happy in her marriage with Steve she is surprised at the sudden attraction she feels for her new boss, Jim and soon the two of them have invited Jim to share their lives and their bed.<br /><br />But now Steve's job takes them away from the desert and into the Nevada mountains, leaving Jim behind. Marcie is so depressed, wondering how she'll ever get over the separation for it was no secret to Steve that she'd fallen in love with Jim and fallen badly.<br /><br />And then Steve starts eyeing their pretty new neighbour...<br /><br />This is a very fast paced book with lots of tangled love lives, dealing with jealousy, love and sex. Steve and Marcie are proud of the fact that they have an \\"open marriage\\" but is it all it's cracked up to be? Are they just setting themselves up for heartache?<br /><br />It is definitely an adult book, no closed bedroom doors here, but the love scenes are tastefully done and by the end of the book you wonder what Marcie and Steve's next amorous adventure is going to be.<br /><br />I must admit I did prefer the first book in the series, maybe because there was a lot more build-up before Marcie and Jim finally got together, but this second one is a good continuation of Marcie's story and fans of the first will surely like this one too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams	2005-09-29

Brush fires that don't seem to be accidents, animals turning up ill<br />or injured and sometimes dead. The properties attacked have one thing in common,<br />the owners were all descendants from Native American tribes.<br /><br />A shaman insists that the troubles are because of a terrible wrongdoing in the past and<br />that evil spirits have come to wreak revenge.<br /><br />Jessica finds herself drawn to Daniel, the Cherokee foreman on one of the ranches, who is<br />convinced the happenings are man made. But who is doing it and why?<br /><br />Daniel and Jessica try to find out what is going on before anything worse can happen,<br />putting both their lives in danger and then someone winds up dead...

And why is the sheriff so convinced<br />that the death was suicide and not murder?<br /><br />A good mystery with a dash of adventure and romance thrown in for good measure, Oklahoma's<br />Gold is a fast paced book, which leaves you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Interesting characters abound, including Miss Emma the feisty sixty-odd ranch owner who is<br />as determined to help Jessica and Daniel as she is to run her property almost single-handedly.<br />She doesn't take no for an answer, even if her nephew is the incompetent sheriff.<br /><br />I felt that the love story with Jessica and Daniel though was a little clich&eacute;d. When they<br />first meet, they are constantly arguing and you just know that because of that they will end<br />up together; it just seemed a bit contrived to me.

He's also discovered a fault in one, if it breaks off, the water displacement would cause enormous floods all around the world, with coastal cities and islands disappearing, in fact, the end of the world as we know it.<br /><br />Seth's boss wants him to give a lecture about his findings to a<br />conference. There's one big problem, Seth has a phobia aobut people, he's absolutely terrified of them and he has a panic attack at work, when it was only his colleagues he had to give a presentation to, how is he going to manage at a conference?<br /><br />Confiding his problem to his boss, Seth gets out of attending the conference as a speaker, and his colleague, Bill gives the talk instead. Unfortunately for Bill, a group of eco-terrosists don't want Seth's findings to be made public, and Bill is gunned down at the conference.<br /><br />The last thing Seth wants is attention, but that what he gets, first from the media who call him \\"The Shy Samaritan\\" after he saved a woman from a burning car, but failed to stay around for any thanks, and now from the terrorists who are trying to kill him.<br /><br />The book is a real page turner, with enough plot twists and turns that you have to keep reading. Seth is not your typical hero, he doesn't have a perfect life, he is just an ordinary guy with problems which he has to overcomce. In my mind that just makes him all the more endearing and easy to relate to.<br /><br />Seth's phobia is handled very well, very realistically (I suffered from this same phobia and the author has got it exactly right.)

Psychologist Dr. Joanna Lander has spent the last two years at Mercy Hospital studying those patients who have \\"died\\" and come back, those who have had a near death experience, or NDE.<br /><br />She isn't the only one, the hospital corridors are also haunted by a spiritualist, and Joanna suspects, fraud. He is convinced that the NDE's are totally spiritual, is it coincidence that he also writes books with such titles as The Light at the End of the Tunnel?<br /><br />Joanna thinks that NDE's might be caused by chemical reactions as the brain dies, or maybe it's some type of survivial mechanism, and when Dr. Richard Wright asks her to become part of his scientific study, where he can induce NDEs with chemicals, Joanna jumps at the chance.<br /><br />Volunteers and funding soon dry up, and Joanna becomes the guinea pig herself, feeling a sense of wonder that she will get to experience what she's been hearing second-hand.<br /><br />But although Joanna expereinces what most people have reported, the light, the tunnel, she discovers something else as well. A part of her knows why everything seems so familiar, and why she has every reason to be afraid...<br /><br />Every so often a book a book comes along and just sweeps you up and you forget everything else in your quest to finish it.

Her husband, and everyone else who discovers her plan, laugh at her, for how could someone who never even finished high school, become a famous writer?<br /><br />But Beth Ann is determined to prove them all wrong, and then who'll be laughing?<br /><br />I loved this book, populated by characters that you can just imagine living in this fictional trailer park, but they never become cariacatures, just very funny. My favourite character was Janet, the local busybody.<br /><br />Most of the love secens take place within Beth Ann's novel, almost like a little book within a book, and are written very well. I couldn't really tell that the book was written by two different authors, their styles melded so well.<br /><br />It is a very funny book, but there are some dramatic moments as well, just like life, although if I lived in President Park, I'm not sure I could take all that excitement!<br /><br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams.	2003-07-04

Until that is, Marcie falls for Jim, her new boss. How can she fall for another man when she is so happy with Steve? Can she really love two men at once?<br /><br />The plot is pacy and the descriptions of the places are so well done that you can imagine you are there, whether it's in a deserted desert canyon or the bright lights of Las Vegas.<br /><br />The sexual tension simmers between Marcie and Jim throughout, and it is surprising how they finally get together.<br /><br />The passages are erotic and literary, with emotions clearly evident.<br /><br />If you want something a bit different and spicy than your average romance book, give Desert Heat a try.<br /><br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams.	2003-06-18

The victim was burned, but there were no marks anywhere except on the body, was it a case of spontaneous human combustion? And then more victims turn up, seemingly unrelated...<br /><br />This is an interesting book, the story and backstory flows well without giving too much away at first. It works well as a straight mystery, and the future setting and technology adds to the tale, without distracting from it. There are enough twists and turns to keep puzzlers happy for hours. I can see this working great as a film.

He is long-lived and comes from a long line of Gypsy Royalty.<br />In modern times, most humans have forgotten the old lore, how to protect themselves against the darkness, all those except the Gypsy people who follow the old ways. Hunters in modern times are hard to come by, but they are needed, for a great battle is about to commence and only the Hunters can stop the powers of Darkness from attempting the Dolmage - Armageddon...<br />This book had a bit of everything, romance, adventure, mystery, horror, action, it was a difficult book to put down. As I was about half way through, I was thinking to myself, &quot;I wish Selena (Creed's lover) was more involved in the story,&quot; and shortly thereafter, my wish was granted, although not in the way I expected! Selena is pivotal to the plot, even though she is not involved so much in the action.<br />My one niggle, and it is a niggle, although the story more than makes up for it, is that the layout of the book was a little odd. There were no spaces or indents between paragraphs. I'm not sure if that's the way the author meant it to be, or if it was a mistake at the printers.<br />Even with that, it's a good book and an interesting read if you like vampire stories with a bit of magic and romance thrown in.	2002-11-11

The statues exert strange influences over all who come into contact with them, including Carlin. Already showing signs of psychic ability, her powers increase when anywhere near the statue.<br /><br />But what is it? Where is it from and how did it get here? For the place where the statue is discovered, predates human occupation of that section of land. Carlin starts getting disturbing visions, war, terror and bloodshed, visions that seem to be of the future. But how can it be stopped?<br /><br />It seems that the cosmos is home to a psychic vampire, who feeds on negative energy from humans and lately, there has been a lot of it about, and things are going to get much worse:<br /><br />For Gaia, Mother Earth herself, wants to wipe out the human race...<br /><br />This is a sweeping adventure of a book, taking the reader on a fantastic journey from the US, India, Africa and the cosmos itself. The descriptions are breathtaking with a wealth of well drawn characters, feisty heroines, murderous villains, all entwined in a story of adventure and romance.<br /><br />It deals with a lot of things, reincarnation, predestiny, psychic abilities, but all flow well within the central storyline. My only complaint is that sometimes the dialogue comes across as a bit stilted and unrealistic and anytime the British characters spoke, it was like a cliche.

The characters are well drawn. Some of the issues in the book such as suicide, incest and homosexuality are explored graphically, which may be a bit close to the bone for some, but I think Ms. Barron has done an admirable job at dealing with them.

Todd was very fond of money.<br /><br />David catches Todd trying to steal from him and almost kills Todd.<br /><br />Fast forward to a few years later. David has a very comfortable living as a psychiatrist, has married the beautiful Ann, not because he loves her, but because he thinks she'd be a suitable wife. He doesn't know what has become of Todd, but he cares very much. He is filled with rage over Todd's betrayal of their friendship and he wants revenge. Badly.<br /><br />He gets his chance when he has a new patient, Rennie Laine, the wife of Matt Laine. But once, Matt had another name, Todd Reams...<br /><br />I would class this a suspense rather than a mystery, because you know everyone's motives from the outset. The first few chapters are filling in background on the characters, which I felt went into too much detail for too much time. I would have preferred perhaps Todd and David meeting again years later, without us knowing what had happened betwen them yet, just knowing that something did.<br /><br />The first few chapters seemed to be setting the scene where you were waiting for something to happen, and happen it did. Once the plot got going, it was a corkscrew of twists and turns, secrets, betrayals and murder. The pace moved faster after that and it felt as if you were being washed away by a raging current and hardly had time to take a breath.<br /><br />The ending has an excellent twist and if you like suspense, you'll love this.<br /><br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams	2002-08-23

Admiral Renata Colby, now a science adviser and her coxswain MacKenzie are on a scientific mission. They are the guests of new members to the Council of Worlds, the Harami, when the shuttle they are in crashes on Sacorra 6.<br />The Harami have been changing the climate on Sacorra 6, to make it more suitable for themselves, they need a very warm climate, warmer than what would be comfortable for humans. The two Harami piloting the shuttle die in the crash, and Colby and MacKenzie are injured.<br />The next morning, they discover that there was something the Harami forgot to mention to the Council of Worlds. Sacorra 6 is a planet that cannot be scanned for life forms, but Sacorra 6 is already inhabited by the People. People who claim be descendants of people from a place called Terra, Earth.<br />These people are living at the tribal level and are appalled that Colby and MacKenzie have spent the night alone together, when they are not mated. A hasty wedding ceremony follows, and Colby and MacKenzie have no choice but to go along with the charade in order to stay alive, but as time goes on and no sign of rescue, they come to trust one another and love one another, even though Colby has a lover back home, a female lover, and she is sure the People wouldn't be too pleased to hear about that.<br />As the months pass, the planet is heating up and they realise that the human life will not survive there for much longer, nor will any Harami, their climate changing has spiralled out of control and they are all in danger. And then they discover why nearly every shuttle trying to land on Sacorra 6 crashes...<br />Although a science fiction novel, the plot doesn't get too much involved with lots of scientific jargon that is difficult to understand, instead it features more on the characters and how they interact with each other in a place with people so much more different than themselves.<br />It's a well written book, with a depth of characters that you come to care about and worry what will happen to them.

The last vestiges of pure Humans live in ghetto-like conditions on Luna, bitter at the Protectorate of Amalgamated Species, who the Humans believe have taken what was rightfully theirs: Earth.<br />The Humans think of the amalgamated species as little more than animals, mutants who have no right to even exist, never mind on their planet! The only reason the Protectorate allows a colony of Humans to live in Luna, is because Human DNA is what made amalgamation possible (the cross breeding of different alien species.)<br />Life is tough on Luna. There isn't enough space with little employment and only the men who can provide for their women are allowed to marry. Some men have more than one wife, if they can afford it as they have to keep each wife in her own house. As a result of only the richer men fathering children, the gene pool is dwindling, but the Humans will not accept any help from the Protectorate in that respect. Humans will breed naturally or not at all.<br />Rik Bohemer escapes from Luna as soon as he is able and becomes a captain on a Defender ship, where he befriends many non-Humans.<br />The Humans have long looked with envious eyes at earth, lots of space, room for everyone to work and live, take a mate, not just the chosen few who could afford it and over the years a plan has been developing to reclaim Earth, and Rik will find his loyalties tested between his comrades and his family...<br />This is a great book. Great characters, great story, great sweeps of imagination. It was a hard book to put down, I could hardly wait to see what would happen next. Rik's dilemma was entirely plausible. His divided loyalties between his family and his friends was heart wrenching. There were lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing. One to curl up with in a chair on a rainy day.<br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Shadows of the Rose.	2002-07-04

She finds herself increasingly drawn to Noah, the writer who wants her story, but danger lurks because the man who killed her mother was not the one who was arrested for it...<br />An excellent romantic mystery, with enough twists, turns and red-herrings to keep even the most jaded mystery buff happy.

I suspect it won't be the last, but in my mind it is certainly one of the best, if not the best.<br /><br />It made a change to have the legends told from the perspective of the women involved in Arthur's life, rather than just the men and their fight in battles.<br /><br />Morgaine becomes a sympathetic character rather than the evil witch she is more normally portrayed as. The characters and situations seem so real that when you look away from the book, you are surprised to see modern day things around you.<br /><br />The portrayal of the new Christian religion against the old religion of the goddess was deftly handled and the comparison between the two was interesting.<br /><br />It's a hard book to put down once started and it's one to read over and over again. I've lost count how many times I've read it now and there is still something new to discover in each reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Shadows of the Rose	2002-06-21

But her heart is heavy and she cannot reconcile her friendship with the fact that Felice's countrymen killed her husband.<br />This is an epic romantic tale, which just sweeps you away into the sights, sounds and smells of eleventh century England, where tensions are high and danger lurks around every corner.<br />I've been to Battle Abbey and the field where it took place, and it was amazing to see everything brought so vividly to life in the book.

Emails from the Edge is a most unusual book, it details the relationship through emails of two friends, Margie who is living in Japan while her husband works there, and Sandy who is living in Texas with all her family around her.<br />Margie finds it difficult to live in a place where she doesn't know the language, finds the culture so different to what she's used to. How would you feel to get lots of bills and you don't even know what they are for or for how much? There is no-one to talk to while her husband is out at work and she finds herself getting more and more depressed.

There is only one person who can even attempt to put her back together again, renowned plastic surgeon, Dr. Stephen White.<br />Monday sees the doctor as self-centered, arrogant and she despairs that her fate is in his hands. When she starts to fall for him, she is worried. Does he only see her as one of his patients, or is there something more to his care for her? She hopes it isn't pity. She would rather die than have anyone pity her...<br />This is a short, fast paced romance, the pages just seem to turn themselves as you want to read on to find out what happens next. The sexual tension shimmers between Monday and Stephen throughout, even if Monday does spend most of the book wrapped in bandages like a mummy!<br />There are some very humorous incidences, including a plumber who gets his hand stuck in a rather unfortunate place...<br />It's a fun book and anyone who likes a bit of humor in their romance will love it.<br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams	2002-05-24

Or is she just remembering some facts that she had forgotten from long ago history lessons?<br />Flitting between Jo's modern life and Matilda's past life, the book is a real page turner, keeping you guessing until the very end.

His people include fairies, elves and other so called mythical creatures that humankind have long ago stopped believing in. He is also the only one of his kind, a man able to shape shift into another being, destined to be alone. When the Sorceress of the Ancients sends him on a quest to New York to bring back stolen Irish artifacts, he hadn't bargained on meeting and falling for feisty young woman Heather Green. Heather works in the acquisitions department in the museum where the artifacts were sent.<br />She can hardly believe that she has finally met someone who lives up to her ideal fantasy, a tall, dark and handsome stranger reminiscent of all those Celtic heroes she'd read about and who she thought didn't exist. Heather is determined to help recover the stolen property, no matter how much Gryphon insists otherwise.<br />The stolen artifacts include a set of three rune stones, which when translated will allow the speaker to shapeshift into something resembling their inner soul. Unfortunately the stones have been used by someone with a dark soul and now a monstrous killer is on the streets, determined to make Heather it's next victim...<br />This is a well plotted story of romance and adventure, with a murder mystery thrown in for good measure, although I think the killer was revealed a little too early. The main plot seems to be how two people so different as Heather and Gryphon can get together, when there are so many obstacles in the way, not the least of which is the fact that anyone who reveals to Outsiders (which is what Heather is, after all), about their existence is condemned to death, and so is the Outsider they told.<br />I think more could have been made of this, why was there such a rule? Surely not all Outsiders were as terrible as they were making out, and they do come to this conclusion in the end. Because there are so few of the magical beings left, they know they will die out unless they can introduce new blood into the gene pool.<br />The love scenes between Gryphon and Heather were deftly handled, erotic without crossing that line into more heavy territory. It was heartbreaking watching the way Gryphon was treated by the others because he was different, he was even more of an outsider than the Outsiders. And what became of Heather once she found out Gryphon's secret? Well, you'll just have to read and find out!<br />A great read.<br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams.ll die out unless they can introduce new blood into the gene pool.<br />The love scenes between Gryphon and Heather were deftly handled, erotic without crossing that line into more heavy territory.

It's an enchanting tale of Celtic and Roman Britain, full of intrigue and suspense, adventure and romance, treachery and betrayal.<br />The book revolves around Marcus ap Iorwerth and his wife Claerwen, who suffers from visions of the future, and Myrddin Emrys (Merlin of the tales). A good touch, I thought was that Myrddin was the illegitimate son of the high king and when he suspects that there will be an assassination attempt on the king's life, he calls in Marcus to help root out the conspirators. Marcus is a spy and master of disguise.<br />Claerwen insists that she must go with her husband on his quest, due to visions she's been having, Marcus agrees reluctantly. He doesn't want to put his wife in danger. The original plot is discovered, but there are betrayals within betrayals. Claerwen and Marcus are falsely accused of treachery and must go on the run.<br />They suffer sacrifice and profound personal loss on the quest to prove their innocence, but will their sacrifice have been worth it?<br />The author hasn't just written a story here, she's weaved a tapestry of words that enchant you even as you read. The plot is infused with a wealth of historical detail, but so subtle that you hardly know it is there. The characters come alive, dancing off the page and into life.<br />I've read quite a few Arthurian re-tellings, but this one is different, concentrating more on the time before Arthur united the Britons, where danger and treachery were ever present and maybe the prophesied future king was the only thing that kept people going.<br />It's a great read, the second in a trilogy, but is a good stand alone novel as well. It's the sort of book you could read again and find something new every time.<br />Highly recommended.<br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams	2002-05-03

Neither male nor female, the Merculians feel decidedly out of place amongst the patriarchal society of Abulon. A society ruled over by a Great Chief, a hunter, another thing they don't have in common, as the Merculians do not eat meat.<br />Triani is the star dancer and his lover, Cham, is excited to be involved in such an adventure, never having been to a different planet before. Excitement soon turns to horror, when Cham is kidnapped, ostensibly by rebels in the hills, but the truth is far more intriguing than that. Why does the Great Chief not want the rebels to be heard? What has he got to hide? His son, Luan, decides to help the Muerculians get Cham back, but he risks being called a traitor for his actions. And the Abulonians don't take too kindly to traitors...<br />A well written novel, full of sexual and political intrigue, it grips from the very first page and is difficult to put down. It's a sweeping adventure, one very easy to get lost in, with a dpeth of character sometimes lacking in sci-fi novels. Sometimes the characters get left behind in place of lots of techno-jargon, not so here. Here the characters are centre stage, as much as Triani is the centre of the dance troupe and anything techincal only adds to the story, not detract from it.<br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams.	2002-04-10

But what he hadn't reckoned on was the sheriff of Clearwater, an honest man with a reputation for always getting his man...<br />There is an ensemble cast of characters here, from the local mayor who is also the newspaper editor, a gentle blacksmith to the bank manager who is also embezzling the funds.<br />This is the first western I've read and my one complaint would be that there are not many strong female characters, they seem either to just be there for a love interest, or to cook! I'm sure that even in the old west, there were some feisty heroines and I would have liked to have seen some mention of them.<br />The book itself is a good engaging tale, the writer draws you in with descriptions of the heat and dust, action packed and full of suspense.<br />A must if you like westerns, and if you don't, then it's still worth a look as an historical novel.<br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams.	2002-04-08

Along with the cryptic letter, there is a key for a safety deposit box, and the letter hints that it contains something that will make them rich and if anything happens to him, they will know what to do with it.<br />Worried by the letter, they call his mother in Nebraska only to discover that Walter has died. It's being called a suicide but his mother is convinced that he was murdered. He was found hanging from the rafters in the apple shed. Patrick and Grace head out to the small town of Albany, Nebraska to discover the truth.<br />What they find there is a place unfriendly to strangers, and secrets long buried coming to the surface. For such a small town, there are quite a few suspects in the investigation and it will be difficult to guess the culprit before the end, I was convinced twice I had it figured out, only to be thwarted again!<br />In Walter's safety deposit box is a recipe for applesauce and oatmeal cookies, it seems that he may have been murdered for the recipe, but who would have the most to gain?<br />Although a murder mystery, there is no blood and gore here. It's a book that leaves you thinking, very fast moving and with a wealth of characters that seem to jump out at you from the page, as if they were in the room with you.<br />A lovely touch at the end is Walter's recipe for the cookies (and you don't even have to kill anyone to get it!) There is also a sneak preview for the next book in the Patrick and Grace series.

And what would happen to them if Sam ever returns to claim his son and his woman?<br />This is a fast paced, page turning book and I was eager to see what happens next. It is based on a true story, but some things have changed for the book, adding to the story of Maria Hallett, rather than detracting from it.<br />Maria starts off as a bit of a tearaway, but marriage and motherhood have settled her and her transition from child to young woman was deftly handled. The subplots inlcude family feuds and Maria's gradual acceptance by the community who were convinced that she was a witch.<br />The ending was a little abrupt, but it certainly intrigues and would make you want to know what happens in the sequel &quot;Port Call To The Future.&quot;<br />All in all, a very good read.<br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams	2002-03-28

You are pulled into this well crafted landscape like a moth unable to avoid a naked flame.<br />Randrik alt Harbinnen is a bit of a rouge, more interested in fighting and having a good time with women than settling down. He finds himself reluctantly thrust into the role of hero, but what is so endearing is that he tries so hard not to be heroic, that his actions are a lot more realistic. Under orders to try and seduce, Perian, a young adept at the Temple of Light, he has no idea what challenges await him.<br />Perian is a Drevnya, a race of people with powers such as healing. She was brought up by human parents, who tried to inhibit her powers by instilling in her that they were immoral and evil. How were they to know that her powers would manifest anyway, no matter how much they tried to prevent it?<br />Someone else has noticed Perian, Azdrefel the souleater and the creator of their world. He was banished into the Everdark to stop him from destroying the very thing he created. But now he has become free, but there is only one way for him to stay that way. He has to inhabit the body of a child at the moment of birth. And he has decided that Perian will be the mother of that child<br />This is a story of romance and adventure.

Okay, so Wales isn't that far off from me, but it is a book which sweeps you away. The historical detail is so accurate that you know Barbara Erskine has done her research, but it doesn't detract from the story.<br />Everything flows so well, that it is easy to imagine the time and place. I really grew to like Eleyna and I was sorry to see the story end. It's one to read again and would make a great present for people who like historical romance.<br />Reveiwed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams.	2001-08-08
US	51795312	R303UPALWVGL2S	0727822977	270157350	Curse This House	Books	4	21	22	N	N	Spooky tale	Leyla Pemberton returns home to Pemberton Hurst after the death of her mother and a twenty year absence. She remembers little of the time she spent her first five years of life there, save for the fact that she was severely traumatised by witnessing the death of her father and brother and has no memory of the incident.<br />Her relatives are strangers to her, a grandmother who rules the house with an iron fist from her room, nervous Aunt Anna, sickly uncle Henry, eccentric cousin Martha, boorish cousin Colin and Theo, her eldest cousin who is the only one to welcome her.<br />What are they hiding?<br />Shocked by Leyla's return, the residents of Pemberton Hurst have no choice but to give up their secret. All the Pembertons are cursed...<br />Leyla doesn't believe it and sets out on her own investigation into her father and brother's deaths. Her enquiries are fraught with danger, because there is someone who doesn't want her to remember that fateful day, but who?<br />This is a well paced and plotted novel, a real page turner. The historical detail is very accurate, but without detracting from the story so that it reads like a novel rather than a history lesson. Leyla is a very likeable character, and I could almost see cousin Martha sitting everywhere, her knitting needles clicking away.<br />My one gripe would be the spelling. It is written in the first person, supposedly by Leyla, a young Victorian English lady, but her spelling was American. It distracted from the story when supposedly reading about an English girl going to &quot;the center of the coppice.&quot; She would have spelled it &quot;centre.&quot;<br />Despite the American spelling, (which is really just a personal opinion) it was a good read, something to curl up with on a rainy day and let the outside world disappear.<br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams.	2001-08-07
US	51795312	R36Q3WEHRMDB1D	1587219085	921144090	The Last Gate	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Engrossing and awe-inspiring	Ver dala Ven are a magical race of beings who once lived and flourished among the ordinary ones as healers, advisors and voluntary servants. Known by their golden eyes, they are a dying breed and Cobo, one of the last of his race fears that they will disappear forever.<br />Exiled in a distant land, he is waiting for signs that the Ver dala Ven will return, for it has been prophesied that they will return, and so will the Masing Star, their spirit guide. Cobo leaves behind his son, who shows little promise of becoming Ver dala Ven, until he is taught by an unprincipled Ver dala Ven, and they both want the power of the Masing Star in order to subjugate people, not to help them.<br />The ordinary ones are also under a curse because they have made another race, the Shodites, their slaves and until the slaves are freed, each family will suffer the loss of a child.<br />This is a book which has everything. Romance, a spiritual quest, adventure, political intrigue. The characters are well drawn with such depth that you feel you know them better than they know themselves. There are a lot of them to get to know, but once you do, you care enormously what happens to them, even the bad guys. It's one you'd want to curl up in your comfy armchair and read on a rainy day (or even a sunny one!)<br />At over 700 pages, it's not a short book, but it is well worth the time to read. I'm certainly looking forward to reading the next one in the trilogy.<br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Silent Screams.	2001-08-07

Steve and Marcie have been happily married for years and feel that nothing can come between them. Until that is, Marcie falls for Jim, her new boss. How can she fall for another man when she is so happy with Steve? Can she really love two men at once? It takes an interesting present from her husband for Marcie to find out!<br />The plot is pacy and the descriptions of the places are so well done that you can imagine you are there, whether it's in a deserted desert canyon or the bright lights of Las Vegas.<br />The sexual tension simmers between Marcie and Jim throughout, and it is surprising how they finally get together. Unlike most romance books, the love scenes don't take place behind closed doors, and the passages are erotic and literary, with emotions clearly evident.<br />If you want something a bit different and spicy than your average romance book, give Desert Triangle a try.<br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, Author of Silent Screams	2001-08-07

Part fairy tale, part an ecological disaster story, the action takes us from the invented Middle Ages of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; to a dark future. Beauty is no ordinary fairy tale heroine, she isn't waiting vainly for her prince to rescue her, she takes life by the throat and survives on her wits.<br />The charcters were well fleshed out and the narrative just made you want to keep on reaing to see what happens next. I actually finished the book in one sitting, I just couldn't put it down.	2001-01-23

The characters had the depth that is sometimes lacking in historical novels, everything was brought vividly to life, from the danger of childbirth in the middle ages to the romance between the characters.<br />An excellent curl up in your favourite armchair book.	2001-01-22
