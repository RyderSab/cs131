The only complaint I have is that the title is misleading: it should have been \\"Learn how to troubleshoot any Linux problem you ever see\\" or something like that.<br /><br />I once thought I'd like to write a book on trouble shooting and problem diagnosis.  I'm glad I didn't, because this would make me feel like I had wasted my time.<br /><br />This is truly excellent.  I have already learned more here than I have anywhere in the past year, and look forward to spending a lot more time with this.	2005-10-13

I've been down this road: it's too overwhelming a subject, authors typically assume far too much prior knowledge, and I'm left feeling puzzled and confused.<br /><br />Well, the subject is overwhelming, and it really can't be covered in one book.  But you have to start somewhere, and this looks like the best place I've seen so far.  Yes, of course you'll need and want other books, and you'll need to spend a lot of time experimenting on your own, but this is (as the title says) your primer: the book that introduces and explains all the confusing little conventions and quirks that you need to know to avoid being totally lost.<br /><br />I really like the approach of trying to relate everything to user space programs and of writing example code and drivers to illustrate concepts.  The authors have also made an effort to point out and elucidate the things that confused them when they first started looking at the kernel.<br /><br />Every chapter has at least a few review questions at the end, and  lots of annotated source code.  Four projects get you started with actual kernel programming.<br /><br />There are, of course, ommissions and lightly covered areas.  Six hundred pages aren't enough to cover everything in depth, and there has to be at least some basic assumption of programming knowledge.  But overall, this looks great and I'm looking forward to spending more time with it.	2005-10-05

It covers important security concepts in easy to understand language, but isn't just a puff piece like you might find in the Sunday paper.<br /><br />It covers all areas of security, from phishing to spam, and (importantly) provides information on wireless security, which is something too few people know about.<br /><br />If you are a techy reading this, buy copies to hand out as gifts.  This is just what Uncle Fred needs.	2005-09-14

I'm \\"ok\\" with regular expressions, but when it gets into grammars, I'm a little weak and have some room to grow.  That's OK: I know I need to learn more in this area. After all, what's the point of a book if it doesn't help you grow?<br /><br />I liked that this introduced and explained parsing related CPAN modules that I otherwise might have been afraid to touch (CPAN is a great resource, but there's so much there that it intimidates those of us who aren't real Perl experts).<br /><br />The examples generally related to things I do every day, so that was helpful.  I'll need to spend more time in the grammar sections, and try out some of the CPAN modules, but this book is a definite keeper.	2005-09-08

Part of that was because I was busy with a lot of other stuff, but a large part was that I didn't have much interest: what do I need a perl debugger for?  What's wrong with \\"print\\"'s?<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.  By the second chapter I was kicking myself for being so stupid.  Perl's debugger is a thing of joy - it almost makes me look forward to my next confused Perl program.. well, I'd still rather not have any problem at all, but reading this book gives me a powerful tool to help me figure out where I went wrong.<br /><br />The authors suggest that some programmers just won't use debuggers.  I think that attitude perhaps comes from experience with poor tools; the Perl debugger is an excellent tool.  This book shows how it is much like Perl itself: you can use it at a simple level without much effort, but it has tremendous power<br /><br />available too if you make the effort to learn.  This definitely will help you do that.<br /><br />This one is definitely a keeper.	2005-08-11

The case studies were excellent, but at the same time disappointing because they concentrated on code bugs/problems rather than optimization of the system itself.<br /><br />In spite of that, this is still valuable,  I particularly liked that the output of tools was mostly fully explained: too many books ignore that detail and leave you wondering what certain column headings mean.<br /><br />I didn't like that the shell examples were run on different machines with the prompt set to the machine name - this was confusing as often I momentarily thought the prompt was a command being run.	2005-07-29

A review of chapter titles raised my eyebrows a too: \\"Fifth Order Markovian Discrimination\\" - I visualized page after page of unintelligible mathematical symbols.<br /><br />That's not the case at all.  Actually Markovian Discrimination is a technique I've used in other programming efforts, and the author explains it in simple and entertaining language.  There's nothing here that any competent programmer can't grasp.<br /><br />I'm a little hesitant to call this book entertaining, although it absolutely is.  I only hesitate because that might give the impression that it's more fluff than substance, and that's not the case at all.  There's a lot of substance here, both in theory and in practical advice.  And although the subject is definitely spam, some of the techniques and methods discussed here apply to other programming challenges as well.<br /><br />The first part of the book is especially enjoyable.  It's a history of spam, and I learned things I hadn't known before about spam's early days.  It then segues into analysis; in a sense you get desert before the meat and potatoes.<br /><br />Overall, worth reading, even by non-programmers wanting to understand more about what current anti-spam efforts are all about.	2005-07-16

I did find it uneven in spite of the editors obvious attempts at blending.  I want to like it - individually the chapters are excellent, but I just have trouble seeing this as a coherent work.  For me, it's choppy and the different styles make me uncomfortable.<br /><br />Perhaps I can see it as a reference book.  I could see myself pulling this down and going to a particular chapter for advice on that specific subject.  As such, this surely has value, but I just don't care for it as a corpus.	2005-07-10

But more importantly,<br /><br />this is direct and practical advice for the kinds of things many of us do every day: writing email, preparing proposals, creating web pages or Power Point presentatations and so on.  The advice is excellent, and the author writes with wit and grace.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this, and hope that its title doesn't limit its audience.  Anyone who does any business related writing will find value here.	2005-07-02

Therefor, for someone totally unfamiliar with Snort, the sudden jump from installation to cook-book recipes may be confusing and unsettling.<br /><br />As there is plenty of material at [...] and as getting Snort running isn't all that complicated anyway, that's not a major flaw.<br /><br />Like another reviewer here, I think the rules sections are probably the best part of the book, though I was also impressed by the attention given to the specifics of Windows and Mac OS X - it's nice to see that level of completeness.	2005-05-20

First: this is ultra-heavy geek territory, but it's not necessarily computer geeks only.  What I mean is that although this is all computer and networking related, any general engineering geek-type will probably enjoy it.<br /><br />What I particularly liked is the author's attention to detail.  I'd start reading a chapteer and think \\"Yeah, I know this\\", but then realize that he was just leading me through the basics because he had something important and interesting to say that I probably did NOT know.. and that was usually true.<br /><br />And although there is a lot of ink devoted to explaining the background of things you may already know, I didn't mind it because the author has style and wit and presents things with a slant that makes it fun to read even when I already knew everything.<br /><br />Before I was done with this, I cornered my geek son-in-law and had him read one chapter.  He's very busy right now, and hasn't had time to read two other books I gave him last month.  He read the chapter and I said \\"You want this when I'm done, right?\\".  He said \\"Oh, yeah. Definitely\\".	2005-04-30

Yes, it touches all the necessary ground, but it only touches, and left me quite confused at several points.<br /><br />It's good - I don't want to imply otherwise.  But the average web site owner is going to struggle with a lot of this and spend a lot of time Googling to understand it.  That's inevitable: this would probably need to be thousands of pages if it really were comprehensive.  But if you think this is going to teach you Apache security, well, it certainly will point you toward the right places but it doesn't stand alone.<br /><br />Also:  I was quite annoyed at the index.  Several times I could not get back to some thing I knew I had read about and had to page-flip to find what I wanted.	2005-04-12
US	52617762	R3LD6VYMWFSACI	159059438X	359030007	Pro Perl	Books	4	14	16	N	N	Excellent	In the introduction, the author says:<br /><br />\\"Programmers who already have some experience in Perl will discover things they didn't know in the chapters that follow, but can nonetheless safely skip this introduction.\\"<br /><br />I remember thinking that was a bit cheeky.  I'm no Perl expert, and I'm sure that there will always be things I could learn, but still: that just felt a little boastful to me.<br /><br />Well, I hadn't even got half-way through the third chapter before I realized how wrong I was.  I kept muttering \\"Really?\\" while switching away to test something I just hadn't known before.  That surprised me (pleasantly, of course).<br /><br />I wish I had this when I first picked up the Camel Book.  The Camel Book's author's are just too smart and too clever:  I didn't understand most of their Perlish puns and witticisms when I first read it, and still find many of them difficult to grasp today.  Peter Wainwright, however, puts things out the way I like to learn, with sensible and illuminating examples that really demonstrate what's happening, and he takes the extra time to explain it in plain English too (and that's why there are so many pages in this book).<br /><br />The danger for someone like me in a book like this is the natural tendency to skip quickly through what you think you already know.  If you've been dabbling in Perl for a few years as I have, there WILL be a lot you already know, but as the author promised, there's also plenty that you probably don't.  I picked up quite a few useful bits in almost every chapter and have promised myself to go back and re-read to find the things I shouldn't have skipped over.<br /><br />In the review copy I read, there still were some unfortunate typos that might confuse someone completely new to Perl.  I hope those will be fixed before the actual publication.  None of them bothered me, but they could be bad for someone starting with no experience at all.	2005-04-02

On the other hand, the format of it is very good for learning: each section presents ideas and concepts, and is followed by a summary that bullets important points, and then by a less formal Q&A section.  Additionally, the chapters are peppered with \\"Notes from the Underground\\" sections that are interesting sidebars on the subject.<br /><br />The more security books I read, the more I feel like I'm standing in a hall of mirrors, with the villian plainly visible pointing a weapon at me.  But where is he?  Which reflection is the one I need to pay attention to?  That's one of the many interesting points discussed here: false positives distract your attention from real problems, and the \\"bad guys\\" know that, so if you ever are under real attack, you can bet that you'll also be seeing all manner of distracting false attacks also.<br /><br />This covers all the important security tools, mostly from a Linux perspective though Windows isn't entirely ignored.  Weaknesses and strengths are examined, but what I really appreciated was the constant focus on reality: this isn't at all a theoretical discussion; it's real-world, get your hands dirty, watch out for this, etc.<br /><br />Great job, the authors obviously put a lot of thought into it.  The only fault I'd find at all is that some of it gets very techy, but that's really unavoidable: you can't begin to understand how some of these exploits work without a deeper understanding of geekish subjects.  I think in general they did an excellent job with all of it.	2005-03-29

In 400 pages, this covers everything from initial installation right through what to do if you did get breached. It covers email security, ftp, <br />dns and bind, ssh, file systems, pam authentication, firewalls, penetration testing and more. <br /> <br />The really impressive thing is that everything is covered well - obviously some of these subjects could be hundreds of pages by themselves, but the author manages to succintly present the important concepts. <br /> <br />I'd certainly recommend this to anyone running a Linux box. <br />	2005-03-02

Not really the book itself, that's great, but what it implies: that this type of exploit hasn't gone away.  I thought things were getting better, but the author explains that is an illusion: it's just that the reporting slacked off.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that programmers keep making the same mistakes over and over again.  This book shows what those mistakes are and how hackers exploit them.  You need a good understanding of assembly language to get much out of this, but if you do have that background, this is a real eye-opener.<br /><br />Extremely detailed, and some of this is a bit of a reach for me (it's been many a year since I did any C or Assembler), but it is fascinating, though in the same sense that watching a tiger stalk you would be: it's scary.<br /><br />Certainly recommended for people who are writing code today, and I hope more of them pay attention, though the authors attitude seems to be that these problems will continue to plague us.	2005-02-26

Their history, the trends, the future, how they work - it's all here.<br /><br />This can be heavy geek territory.  If you aren't fascinated by the details of executable programs and the like, some of this will be hard sledding.  But if you are the type who likes to take things apart to see how they work, this is for you: Peter Szor, Symantec's chief antivirus researcher, who saw his first virus before he even knew how to read assembly language, carefully explores this subject from beginning to end.<br /><br />A lot of this is, of course Windows related, but there is also coverage of Linux viruses and worms.  All sorts of virus types are explored and laid out in general, and certain specific instances are explored in detail.<br /><br />I read through this quickly in an hour or so to get the big picture, but it will be sitting close at hand for several weeks as I spend more time in specific sections.  It's really an encyclopedic piece of work.<br /><br />Recommended mostly for the curious geek or serious security professional only, but highly, highly recommended for that audience.  For the less geeky, this would still be of interest because the historical and more general overviews it contains.	2005-02-21

It's heavy on C code, and if you can't at least read C, a lot of this isn't going to mean much to you. However, it does have a lot of general information that is of interest to anyone, and it could be helpful in unmdertstanding how someone else's milter works and how to modify it, etc.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, but I like code heavy books - you may not.<br /><br />There's a surprising amount of detail here; even getting into how to decode mime, and advice on user friendliness.  I was a bit amused that they gave advice on how to attract spam to test milters; I don't think too many of us have any shortage of spam nowadays.	2005-02-19

Tips and tricks, lucid explanations, detailed examples and always fun to read.  I made the mistake of looking over the table of contents - it drove me crazy because I just couldn't decide what I wanted to look at first!  Finally, I just dove in and enjoyed myself.<br /><br />If you have been a Perl fan from Day One, and always subscribed to all the right magazines at the right time, you would have been able to read all these origibnally.  I did see some of these, but I missed most, because I was a latecomer to Perl itself and because of bad magazine timing.  It doesn't matter - I have them now.	2004-12-30

I use Perl frequently, but my code is generally clumsy and lacking in elegance.  It does the job I need done, but people like Larry Wall usually go way over my head when they talk about how to do things.<br /><br />That's why I've been more than a bit nervous about Perl 6 (it doesn't help when Larry throws around words like 'Apocalypse').  I felt, well, threatened.<br /><br />Scott Walters book took me by the hand and gently showed me that I have little to fear and a lot to gain.  I had read Larry Wall's explanation of Parrot and Ponie and had left still confused; Scott helped me understand it.<br /><br />I was also happy to learn that I could use available Perl 5 modules that would let me try out Perl 6 features.  Scott demonstrates the new features with code, and I could actually try it out myself as I followed along.<br /><br />I'm sure there will be many, many Perl 6 books, but this was a nice place for me to start.	2004-12-30

That may be because they are home users or have small networks - I think this is very useful for the admins of larger systems (though it may not be useful for VERY large systems).<br /><br />Or it may be that the subject matter is too dry. Sure, this can be a boring subject, but isn't that the point?  System administration is often boring, and particularly so if you haven't automated it.  Making global changes isn't exciting, but it is something some of us have to do now and then.<br /><br />I'm surprised that it averages two stars - I think it is better than that.  When I first get a technical book, I flip to a few random pages - I'm looking to see if I find things I didn't already know and if things are well explained.  I found a LOT of things I was not previously aware of and I thought the coverage was thorough.<br /><br />I agree that it has a strong Linux slant, but I don't see that as a problem - most of what this book suggests could be translated to any system.	2004-12-12

As important as licenses are, an annotated listing of them didn't sound like anything I wanted to flop back on the couch with. However, the author has managed to make this both interesting and educational.<br /><br />It covers all the common open source licenses, explaining what each section means, and digging into problems that might come up for the licensor or licensee. Open Source isn't all that it covers: standard shrink-wrap licenses are examined, as is Sun's Community Source License and Microsoft's \\"Shared Source Initiative\\".<br /><br />Finally, the book itself is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs license. It is interesting that O'Reilly is willing to publish works like this, but I'm glad they are.	2004-10-14

No wonder: at almost 800 pages, this is quite a chunk of reading material.<br /><br />I had been impressed by the first edition. The only real complaint I had about that was its exclusive focus on Debian Linux; that's been corrected here. The first edition was available on-line in its entirety; this is not, although you can see a sample chapter and the table of contents at (...).<br /><br />Unlike the first edition, this covers a lot more basic material. Don't let that turn you off if you have outgrown the beginner books - unless you are expert at everything, you'll find helpful material here. There are pointers to esoteric utilities you probably have never heard of mixed in with the \\"getting started\\" stuff.<br /><br />I was interested that Amazon reviews were luke-warm. I think it deserves better. I would have liked to see less attention to the real basics, but that does make this useful to the beginner also. One Amazon review didn't like it because it was too geeky, a complaint I can't sympathise with. Another didn't like the concentration on command line tools - I hope that isn't a sign of things to come where Linux users join their Windows brethren in disdain of character based interfaces.	2004-10-10

Blacklists don't work, Bayesian filters don't work - nothing works well enough to stop spam entirely.<br /><br />Still, Spamassassin is useful, and because it is configurable (and open source), you at least have complete control. That assumes, of course, that you understand how it works. That's the reason to buy a book like this, but I was a bit disappointed in that area. I'm not sure yet whether the fault is Spamassassin - maybe it's just not as configurable as it should be - or this book just not explaining things very well.<br /><br />For example, I note that an awful lot of the spam I get is from certain IP blocks. I don't want to block out large ranges arbitrarily, but I thought it might be interesting to increase the Spamassassin score if the sender was in one of those ranges.<br /><br />Well, if there is a way to do that, I still haven't figured it out. It could be me - maybe I just haven't read things carefully enough - but I didn't feel that I understood Spamassassin after reading this. Maybe this needs to be a bigger book - only about 100 pages are devoted to configuration and modifying rules, the rest is installation advice.<br /><br />On the other hand, there's nothing else out there, and this isn't totally without value. If you are using Spamassassin, you may want to pick this up - it could be a long wait for anything better.	2004-09-24

He didn't even mention using Word, other than as a cautionary &quot;Don't&quot;. No, he suggests Notepad, Mac TextEdit, or vi, pico etc. That alone is so refreshing.<br />But there's a lot more to like. This is a complete, soup to nuts, &quot;getting started with web pages&quot; guide that brings you from simple HTML right through Javascript, Cascading Style Sheets, basic forms, and even validation tools. The style is practical, with useful examples that don't get bogged down trying to cover every single aspect of every single tag. Yes, you'll want other, more comprehensive references later in your learning, but this really is a fast on-ramp to that Information Superhighway we used to hear so much about.<br />I didn't honestly expect to learn a lot from this, but I was pleasantly surprised to pick up a few pointers on things I missed in more detailed documentation. There were a few things here and there I took some exception to - things that aren't &quot;wrong&quot;, but aren't entirely &quot;right&quot; either, but really these were just expository opinon: I would have explained them differently. One or two small and easily understood typo's didn't mar my enjoyment either.<br />This is definitely a book I can strongly recommend for someone who wants to start writing their own web pages.	2004-06-13

This is not the book you hand to Grandma (unless Grandma is a system admin), but it is a very well done Linux guide/introduction.<br />The first couple of chapters are old hat to any Unix user, being just basic overviews of how Unix in gneral works, but Brian quickly gets into the real meat of Linux with chapter 3 &quot;How Linux Boots&quot; and goes on from there with coverage of networking, printing and everything else you'd expect. If that were all there was, I'd be impressed and would recommend this book, but there is more. There are two excellent chapters on programming tools and compiling source code. These include troubleshooting compilation problems, an often ignored aspect of our Open Source world. A third related chapter covers kernel compilation specifically and again goes beyond the usual treatment.<br />Throughout the book, Brian gives useful hints and suggestions.  He has obviously used and administered real Linux systems and has good experience and advice to share.<br />I like Brian's writing style and the definite techie orientation. If you are a tech person investigating Linux, this is a good book to read.	2004-06-05
US	52617762	R3FNQRZMHC2VS	1593270305	528757237	The Official GNOME 2 Developer's Guide	Books	4	36	36	N	N	Excellent intro	I'm more of a command line kind of guy, but there are things better done in a graphical treatment. When this is true, I often resort to HTML, but that isn't always suitable either. Most of what I've read about GUI programming has left me feeling daunted by the learning curve, and the writing itself has mostly been difficult to read and unsatisfying<br />This book was a delightful exception. As its introduction promises, the content &quot;lies somewhere between a tutorial and a reference&quot;. The code examples are often just the kind of things you would write yourself to test-drive your understanding; no unnecessary fluff. There are complete programs also, and these are downloadable from the No Starch web site.<br />Matthias Warkus has a real knack for explaining complex subjects. I particularly liked his way of explaining object inheritance, which is completely upside down from the way it is usually presented, and thereby makes a much more understandable case for using OO code.<br />The first chapter is an overview of GLib capabilies. I was quite surprised at the things GLib includes: I come from the days when you needed to buy commercial libraries to get features like memory management, linked lists, B-trees, etc. The second chapter covers GObject, which adds Object Oriented capability to standard C programming. That's an important aspect of Gnome: it is plain vanilla C with the OO stuff added on through the GObject library. For those of us who have yet to be entranced by C++, that's important.<br />Chapters three and four explain GTK+ and the Gnome libraries, the overlap between them, and hen you'd use either. Chapter five is a lucid introduction to Glade, the interactive development tool for Gnome. I was interested to note that Glade produces XML files that your programs references through calls to Glade libraries.<br />The rest of the book is miscellaneous coverage that wasn't covered elsewhere; compiling issues, configuration helpers like Gconf. I had ben previously unaware of the GnomeVFS discussed in chapter eight which allows your program to transparently access remote web servers and archive formats like PKzipped files.<br />All in all, this looks like a very good intro to Gnome GUI development.viously unaware of the GnomeVFS discussed in chapter eight which allows your program to transparently access remote web servers and archive formats like PKzipped files.<br />All in all, this looks like a very good intro to Gnome GUI development.	2004-05-16
US	52617762	R1YBE14JR52CKL	1593270127	561113073	Wicked Cool Shell Scripts	Books	4	60	62	N	N	Surprised me	I often take a dim view of books that use superlatives in their titles. I also don't think there is anything &quot;wicked cool&quot; about shell scripting in general: if you need anything complex at all, Perl or something else is probably a much better way to to it. Shell scripting gets awfully nasty awfully fast.<br />However, I was wrong. Yes, shell scripting is an abominable way to approach most of the tasks this book explores. Just the same, the author does it &quot;wicked cool&quot; and you can learn a lot both from how he sees the problem and the other Unix tools he uses as part of the script. So while you might shudder at the idea of writing a link-checker in Bash, the author's clever use of Lynx's &quot;traverse&quot; flag is something you might make use of elsewhere. You'll find useful things like that throughout the book, and even if you'd rather write it in Perl or whatever, the logic is worth examining.<br />Mac OS X users will appreciate that a whole chapter is devoted to that. There's nothing particularly deep there, nothing you will be surprised by, but it's nice to see Mac get specific mention. That brings up another important point: shells are different and Unixes are different. The author does pay a lot of attention to the differences that can cause problems for your scripts when they need to run on different platforms.	2004-03-02
US	52617762	RFQ63TDT48Z36	0596003919	251349583	Linux Security Cookbook	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Very useful security cookbook	Enjoyable and useful.  I didn't really expect to learn a whole lot from this, but surprisingly (and happily), I did.  It's jam packed with practical advice, and avoids the too often seen slant of many security books that don't understand the concept of &quot;good enough&quot;.  These authors understand that no security is 100%, that you are always trading off convenience, cost, and other variables.  Their suggestions and recipes carefully explain the risks and advantages involved with each, and often give alternatives for those with higher or lower security needs.<br />This would be an excellent book for the new administrator to have right  beside the keyboard, but it also will be useful for those with more experience. The recipes are concise, but complete: there is little wasted verbiage, yet you don't feel that anything important was left out.<br />As I said, I learned a few things.  For example, I had never really looked at xinetd, assuming that it was just a slightly polished up inetd with different configuration files.  My failure to look below the surface (or even really read the man page) caused me to miss quite a bit, and this book was a wake-up for me on that.<br />Recommended, worth the money.	2003-07-12
US	52617762	R18VHP1J26YX83	0596004605	824873719	Mac OS X Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tricks	Books	5	13	18	N	N	I was so wrong	Here we have a  rather well done little book that I wasn't  going to bother to review because I assumed that it was just a boring  collection of the same old tired hacks one can find on dozens of web pages. The very idea of even opening such a book made me tired, bored, uninterested. I just didn't think I could even bear to read it, never mind review it.<br />Once again, I was wrong.<br />The first thing I liked about this is something we are starting to  see more frequently: some use of color in the text.  Photos and screen shots are still black and white (still too expensive to do that much  yet), but section headings are nicely set off in purple.  Such a small thing, and probably something that will become very common soon, but  it enhanced my reading experience.<br />If this really was the boring collection of so called hints I thought it was, the purple text effect wouldn't have been enough to keep me going.  But  I did keep going.  Yes, a lot of it was stuff I already knew, and some  of it (the movie editing, for example) is stuff I have no real interest in.  But all of it is practical: there's none of the silly \\"turn your scroll bars into cartoon characters\\" kind of nonsense.  The authors obviously use their Macs to do real work, and the tips and hacks reflect that.  Would you  expect to find instructions and examples of using MySQL and PostgeSQL?  This  has those.  It also has instructions for using a Bluetooth enabled phone as a modem, and enough other esoteric hacks that you'll surely find  more than enough value for your money.<br />Interestingly, I couldn't find a single thing I disagreed with either.  Every time I thought that a little carelessness had crept in, the next  paragraph gave the very caveat that had bothered me.<br />Nicely done.  That's almost always true of O'Reilly books, but it still needs to be said.	2003-04-12
US	52617762	RFCUVA3KGGJAE	1930110855	462723635	Programming Mac OS X: A Guide for Unix Developers	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good Introduction to Mac OS X programming tools	The intent of this book is to introduce Unix developers to Mac OS X.  As such, I think it does a pretty good job.  It doesn't go in to great depth; for example another reviewer complained about its lack of coverage for Carbon or mixed mode programming.  That's not entirely fair though given its intent: while some Unix developers may be interested in producing OS9 capable apps, my bet is that most are just going to ignore anything prior to X entirely - and they should!  There is a small appendix that covers the history of  Mac OS prior to X, but it does not cover programming and I don't think it should.<br />I do have some minor criticism.  I had never even looked at Project Builder/Interface Builder (the programming IDE) before picking up this book.  There's a good sized introductory chapter on using this for a simple project.  I worked through it, but it wasn't entirely easy sailing.  I'm not sure whether that was because Project Builder has changed slightly since this writing, or if the author is just so familiar with it that he accidentally used incorrect language here and there.  In any case, I found myself confused at certain points.  However, there were no show stoppers: if you are a developer, you will understand the goal and enough of the concepts not to get hung up by these small errors or omissions.  While I might wish these things were more carefully reviewed by having an unfamiliar user actually run through them, I don't see this as a major weakness at all.<br />In addition to Project Builder and Interface builder, this covers Objective-C, and Applescript.  It isn't going to teach you much about either of these; you'll need other books for that.  But it will introduce you to them, lead you through building a simple example applicatio, show you how the Apple debugging tools work, and show you how to create HTML documentation for use with Apple's Help Viewer.	2003-03-28

At close to 800 pages, it's jam packed with everything you would want to know about OS X. It's current through 10.2, and seems to have been updated as late as January 2003.<br />This is a techy style book.  It's not a hold your hand book, but it  isn't an entirely dry reference work either.  It's something in between, and it is very well done.<br />In addition to a detailed command reference and an extensive faq-like how-to  section, there are complete chapters on networking, printing, scripting and development, X windows and more.  Very complete, very well written.<br />The command reference section is extensive and seems to be very complete. This isn't just a rehashing of man pages, and doesn't just pick up the  most common stuff.  I checked for a number of the more obscure Mac OS  X specific commands that nobody ever mentions: this book has them.<br />The Development section is more than 100 pages itself. Although I really haven't even started to look at OS X development tools yet, this looks like a very good introduction.<br />Overall, this is the most complete Mac OS X book I've reviewed to date. I definitely recommend it without any hesitation.	2003-03-06

I love telling Mac people this - so many of them still don't know.<br />I also love that Apple has gone in this direction. It's wonderful, because it opens up whole new worlds for Unix folk. It also helps the Linux software market and vice versa: if you write software for one, a port to the other should certainly be a lot easier than a port to Windows.<br />I am of course not yet experienced enough to make a complete judgement of this book's value. I do have a little Mac experience from the early 90's, but I'm more than weak there. So I really appreciated that the author expects that some of his audience will have no Mac background at all. Throughout the book, it's evident that he has that in mind, and there is even a whole appendix devoted to people switching from Windows. Well, that's not exactly my thing either, but I still found it helpful.<br />Of course it is difficult for someone so intimately familiar with Macs to avoid knowledge assumptions entirely. There are a few places here and there that make reference to things you just wouldn't know about if you have never seen a Mac at all. Still, I suspect that someone with even less Mac exposure than I have would not get completely confused.<br />The Unix related chapters are accurate and reasonable. There's not much of anything really geekish, but I really didn't expect that from this sort of book.<br />In general, the book is written well, with a light hearted style and enough humor to keep it from ever being dull. I suspect that this will be by my side constantly as I start exploring this wonderful new world of Apple operating systems.	2003-02-12
US	52617762	R1KKN1MLJE6PL3	0596002130	118912687	Understanding the Linux Kernel (2nd Edition)	Books	4	20	35	N	N	I did like this more than the first edition	I didn't like the first edition of this book, and I still don't like the current edition, though I admit I'm having a hard time understanding why.<br />I think that part of the problem is the deliberate \\"bottom-up\\" approach: this starts out in the first chapter dealing with memory addressing at the hardware level and goes on from there. I tend not to like bottom up explanations: give me the grand picture first and then drill down. But that can't be all of it: The Magic Garden Explained effectively starts there too, and I enjoyed that. Frankly, this approach probably is the best way to handle this subject matter in spite of my preferences.<br />Perhaps part of this is that I'm not playing by the rules. There is a strong implication in the preface that one should be looking at the source code while reading. One of the reviews at Amazon.com says the same thing. I didn't do that, and that may contribute to my vague dissatisfaction.<br />I certainly can't complain that this is incomplete or badly written. It covers everything that should be covered, and it is current as of the 2.4 kernels. The writing style is lucid, and I think that in general the writers have done a better than average job of explaining the why and wherefor in addition to the how.<br />I think maybe I've just lost my interest in this level of detail. There was a time when I found it fascinating in the most literal sense, but that was years ago. I just don't have any burning desire to understand kernel internals anymore.<br />You, of course, may still have that interest. If so, this would undoubtedly be a worthwhile addition to your library.	2003-02-12
US	52617762	RX27XGWL1SPI4	0596004702	342561929	Learning Unix for Mac OS X, 2nd Edition	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Good Starting Introduction	This is a pleasant introduction to Unix that someone just starting out with Mac OS X will find very useful. Don't bother with this if you are already experienced with Unix or Linux, but if you've never been at a Unix command line in your life, this is a good place to start.<br />I liked that the authors went to some effort to cover what could go wrong with the examples they used. I think it was also good that they covered Fink and a few Unixy applications like Pine.<br />There are bigger and more inclusive books out there, but the brevity of this (128 pages) makes it very non-threatening for the command-line phobic. The back cover states that its target audience is traditional Macintosh users, and while I don't fall into that category at all, I suspect that even the most fearful will find this to be a painless experience.<br />I did think it a little odd that the Apple Developer Connection considers this a &quot;Recommended Title&quot;. While it's certainly true that developers can be just as Unix naive as anyone else, I would think that most Mac Developers would want something far more techy than this. I don't mean to imply that this is just fluff; but it definitely is just a light surface treatment and wouldn't seem to take a developer where they probably want to go. I could be wrong, of course.	2003-02-10

Unlike many of the other security books I've reviewed, this isn't full of tcpdump traces and the like. It is, however, a really excellent overview of security that can introduce a system administrator or a general manager to the subject.<br />There are actually a very few pages that deal with things like disabling unused services, but that's just 14 pages from a 337 page work, and those are really more illustrative than specific. Instead, this covers the who, the how and the why of hackers, the legal climate, and includes examples of actual incidents.<br />Perhaps a good indication of the target audience is the Glossary, which includes definitions for &quot;back door&quot;, &quot;client/server&quot;, &quot;Kerberos&quot;, &quot;newsgroup&quot; and &quot;Trojan horse&quot;.<br />If you are looking for programmer level information, this isn't what you want. On the other hand, this is much more technical and focused than something you might read in Newsweek or your Sunday newspaper.<br />Recommended for business owners and managers who need to understand computer security even though others may actually implement it, or as a base introduction for technical people with no previous exposure.	2003-02-01

On the one hand, there's a lot of good stuff here. On the other hand..<br />The problem here is that a LOT of this book was written about early versions of Mac OS X. Too many things talked about have changed and either work differently or don't work at all. In fairness, there is a section at the end that is newer than the rest of the book that does cover most of that, but if you are reading front to back you will have some disorientation.<br />Some of the problems just come from lack of basic Unix knowledge. I don't mean that there's anything too horrible here, just a few minor misconceptions and a general feeling that the author wants to avoid the command line at all costs. On the other hand, if you share his apparent dislike of command line work, you'll be pleased to find his more graphical workarounds.<br />The focus of this boook is troubleshooting, and even with the problems I have mentioned, it does cover all manner of problems, and attempts to give enough technical background to be interesting and educational - it's not just &quot;Command Option blah blah fixes that&quot;; the author does make the effort to explain what's going on underneath.<br />So, while I can't heartily recommend that you drop everything and rush out to buy this, it is a book you will find value in.	2003-01-23

I never owned the first edition, and skipped the third. By page count, this is only 42 pages longer then that second edition, and yet it immediately seemed to me that there is much more here.<br />There is. Obviously there have been cuts too - warnings and workarounds for problems and situations that no longer exist, reduction of some tables and listings that probably never were really necessary. There are new chapters (I don't know if they are new from the 3rd edition), and new sections.<br />I like that the book provides a fair amount of troubleshooting information along with its basic introductions. Of course, that does mean that it will quickly become outdated, just as previous editions have. Some Amazon reviews complain about this sort of thing, but I still think it's better to include it.<br />Other reviews have complained that this isn't a beginners book. Perhaps it is not - I hesitated before including it in that category, but ultimately decided that it still belongs there even though it may be a little more advanced than a rank beginner might desire. Actually, I'm not even sure that's fair: a rank beginner will find this useful; it's just that they may find it a bit overwhelming too. This isn't \\"Linux for Dummies\\", it is very comprehensive and has more than sufficient detail in every area it covers.<br />Not too many of us will be able to dismiss this as \\"just stuff I already know\\", either. I picked up things in just a casual skimming, and even more when I went back to read carefully. Of course that is hard to do when you already have a fair amount of experience, but it's worth the effort.	2003-01-16

They aren't exactly geek books either. Leo Laporte has pulled off the rather amazing feat of writing books enjoyable by just about any level of computer user.<br />My wife and I are a good example of that. I don't make claims to great geekdom, but I'm more than competent around computers. My wife, however, is just a casual user - email and the web mystified her until very recently. Her primary computer use is just word processing, which she certainly became proficient at, but she has little knowledge ( or interest ) in much else concerning her computer.<br />I had picked up these books because Leo hawks them incessantly (but not objectionally) on Tech TV. If you don't get Tech TV where you are, it's a cable station devoted entirely to technology - it's geek tv. Leo is one of the hosts of The Screen Savers, a 90 minute show that I watch very frequently. Somewhat surprisingly, my wife often watches it with me and, even more surprisingly, she actually admits to enjoying it.<br />Well, maybe it's not all that surprising. The show is fast paced, has a lot of energy, and the hosts and staff are very upbeat, often funny, and do an excellent job of explaining technology in interesting and enlightening ways. A \\"technology is fun\\" attitude permeates the show.<br />That same playful attitude is found throughout these books, and I was scanning through the 2002 version while my wife was reading something else. These are books you can just flip open and read because there's no real organization; just tips and facts scattered about in Almanac style. I was enjoying these thoroughly, and I had read a few little tid-bits aloud for my wife. Then I came across a half dozen Microsoft Word tips, so I handed that volume to my wife and picked up the other. After a bit of reading I started to feel tired, so I put it down and told her I was ready for bed. \\"Go ahead, I'll be right up\\", she said.<br />Yeah, right. About an hour later I got up and found her looking through the 2003 volume. That's the first time in 35 years I've found her looking at one of my computer books. But, there's simply a lot of good stuff here that will interest anyone who uses a computer.<br />At this writing, Amazon had a combo deal where you could buy both books for a good price.
