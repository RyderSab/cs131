I'm giving this book 1 star with great sadness because my 13-month-old loves it. However, the spiral binding is a terrible idea. We have some of the other Priddy Bicknell books, and they've held up just fine. For 13 months, she's actually very careful. But even adults have some problems with spiral bindings (think of those photo albums with pages starting to tear out), so it was no great surprise when some of the pages ripped. And because of the binding, you can't tape them back in. If you want to read this with your child, fine, but what kid doesn't want to turn the pages herself??  Either plan to replace this---FREQUENTLY---or buy some of the other Priddy books instead.	2004-04-17

Books	5	10	10	N	N	A wonderful book for babies and toddlers	I was surprised to see the age range listed as 4 - 8. This is clearly a board book for babies. My 8-month-old sits through it happily and it's quickly become MY favorite book (hers is Brown Bear). The illustrations are adorable. The animals gestures are the perfect touch. Any parent with a boo hoo baby will fall in love with this book.	2003-11-06

I don't want to give the story away, but if plot-hopping is your idea of a good read, this is for you. (Actually, it's still not for you. Try the Jasper Fford books---they're much better.) If you prefer a story that's actually cohesive, with characters that are actually well-developed, pick up something else. The only reason this is on the NYTimes list is because someone at the Today show picked it.	2003-10-01

Rosenfeld is so skillful at capturing the voice of a 12-year-old girl at the edge of the cliff called adolescence, that it feels almost autobiographical. Many readers may feel she is telling their story.<br />Second, the plot is heartwrenching, with the sadness tempered by humor. Readers can't help but root for Justine as they laugh and cry with her. The diary is an ingenious plot device that adds another dimension to the main story.<br />This book brought me back to my own childhood, and I could not put it down even when the tears began to flow.  This is a *much* better story than The Center of Everything, which is due out later this summer. I hope word of mouth brings Rosenfeld the audience she so deserves.  Go Justine!	2003-05-01

Apparently, the soon-to-be-flooded-with-torrents-of-blood pants. The reviewer who pointed out the negativity is right on the mark. Do we really want to know that the author was scrubbing blood off the floor so the nurses didn't have to? Did this even really happen? I found absolutely nothing reassuring, helpful, or comforting in this book. Find an alternative if you can!	2003-03-08

The Western poetry is an admirable twist. But in the long run, I just could not finish this book. The pieces did not gel together for me. I didn't care enough about the characters to care how they wound up.<br />A MUCH better book with a similar brother-sister relationship is THE BOTTOMS by Joe Landsdale. That title won an Edgar but never received the press it deserved. If you insist on trying Peace Like a River, go for it, but purchase a copy of THE BOTTOMS as well.	2002-11-22

I don't know why PW calls it &quot;glum&quot;: yes, bad things happen to people. This book is about HOPE and REDEMPTION and second chances for wounded people.  I don't want to give away the plot, but anyone who likes a great story told in moving language will enjoy this book. Not unlike the touching work of Kay Gibbons.  Share it with a friend!	2002-11-01

This book starts out from a teenager's point of view, leading me to expect something of the same, and it had my full attention. Then it switched to the father's point of view, and after a while I just stopped caring about these characters (the father seemed particularly weak). It was difficult to follow anyone's motivation, and the sex scenes seemed incongruous to the way the book started out (a young girl's voice). The concept was strong, but perhaps the author was too ambitious in scope.	2002-10-30

The characters are so [sad] it's extremely frustrating to read.  I could not read it page by page---one week felt like twelve years. I can't imagine a more disappointing romance.  Buyer beware. <br />Try Scarlet Feather by Maeve Binchy or anything by Pilcher for a well-written romance in this genre.  Give this one a miss.	2002-07-24

The explosion reads like a real-life story and you ache for all the victims. The relationships between the female lawyer,  her best friend, and her family feel genuiune. These could be people you know, especially with recent events in the news. The suspense and plot twists are skillfully done; you're never sure which end is up and who the &quot;good guys&quot; are. The author successfully demonstrates that there are no black-and-white issues; each side of the story holds weight.  This title should climb the bestseller lists in the tradition of John Grisham. Spread the word to all your book friends. And bravo to you, Ms. Sloan!	2002-04-01

Readers will soon be engaged by the characters in this small town. The clever heroine counsels kids and combs for clues with much aplomb. Who could be the murderer?

The author had an interesting idea, but the book is so poorly written I found it impossible to read it from cover to cover. I'm not a big fan of Richard Paul Evans, but I appreciate the genre, and this book doesn't even come close to hitting the mark. It would be an act of kindness to let this book go out of print in the hopes that another publisher will pick it up and give it the edit it needs.	2001-12-29

This compassionate, beautifully written tale celebrates life, death, art, poetry, and sisterhood. It lacks the bitterness of Girl with a Pearl Earring, which I didn't care for at all. You will never look at these paintings in the same way again. It also reminded me of the beauty of what my own sister left behind. Many thanks to the author for such a compelling book.	2001-10-28

It reads like a how-to manual for serial killers, and the ending is straight out of a Lifetime Originals Movie.  It's that cheesy. Save your money and buy something else from a writer who can do more than coat countless pages with blood to hide a thin plot.	2001-09-26

As another reviewer notes, you just don't care who fathered the neighbor's baby. This drones on for pages and pages. The &quot;plot&quot; could have been cut by two-thirds. I had to start skipping ahead.  None of the women have any spunk, and the fact that the wives believe ALL of the husbands had the potential (not just the opportunity, but the potential) to be unfaithful doesn't say much for these marriages. You dislike all the characters equally. Even worse, the idea that if you just love each other enough and in the right way you'll finally be able to conceive a baby is incredibly insulting. Get this book off the bestseller list by making a different purchase.	2001-08-22

She has many creepy admirers, and from page to page (gotta love those short chapters), it's impossible to tell who the most threatening stalker will be. Plus, there's a romance or two on the side . . . Tons of fun &amp; perfect for late-summer beach reading.	2001-08-20

Just as it gets interesting in the last section---where they each have the chance to go back for 3 weeks and do it all over again---the book is done.  As a copyeditor, I'd say Deveraux's editor was asleep at the wheel this time.  Buy it for fun, but don't expect a whole lot.	2001-05-30

While she tries to wrap all the ends together (the wedding, Nick's  previous service as an FBI agent, etc.) it just doesn't gel. If you like  this type of writing, try Jayne Ann Krentz instead. There, the humor is  clear, the characters are clear, the plots are clear. Garwood's book is  like trying to see the road in a storm when your defroster is broken---hazy  at best.	2000-08-01

I wasn't aware that some of the illustrations were missing, and as long as you read  it together, pages aren't likely to be torn.

A much hated bishop disappears ALONG WITH AN ENTIRE SUBWAY CAR. Apparently this trick was pulled off in real life. In any case, where is he, and what could the  motive be? The story alternates point of view, chapter by chapter, and  includes a young man with relationship issues who receives counseling from  Father Ryan. Fast-paced right through to the end, clearly aimed at Catholic  readers but universal enough for all to follow.	2000-07-18

Every dialogue mirrors how people really speak; each character could be someone you know. The pictures the author  paints are so real you're sure you've met these folks before. The old adage  for writing is &quot;show, don't tell&quot;---and this book SHOWS so  vividly how the truth can set you free if only you can gather the inner  strength to face it.

The steps that Kevin, an artist at  heart, takes to preserve his love for &quot;the crazy debutante&quot; are  completely touching---and the twists and turns don't stop.
