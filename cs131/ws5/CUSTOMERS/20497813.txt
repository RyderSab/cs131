Deborah DeShields' book, written in first person, is the story of the life of Amos Jedidiah Hankins, a former slave who joins with the 10th Cavalry.  Labeled &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; by the Plains Indians, Amos describes life on the field and in the garrison, in a moving way that puts you where the characters are.  I am pleased to have shared in this story and the story of these unsung American heroes.	2004-03-06
