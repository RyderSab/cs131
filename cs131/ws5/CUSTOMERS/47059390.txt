This Indigo Teen Dreams CD is a wonderful resource to help teenagers learn to empower themselves by learning how to connect with their inner being and strength, as well as how to deal with this very stressful time in their lives.<br /><br /> Considering all the pressures they have to deal with, from peer and social pressures (which often lead to eating disorders),a changing physiology, pressures to do well in school and other activities, teens can benefit immeasurably by learning the techniques presented here.<br /><br />This CD has tracks that contain guided affirmations, deep breathing techniques, relaxation and visualization, tools that will not only help them during the difficult teen years but can also help them build a foundation that can help them for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />By learning to go within and learn how to live from the inside out rather than from the outside in, teens can find a place that is always available to them, a haven to weather the storms of life. Even when they may not be dealing with a specific stressful event, these tools can help with the ability to concentrate and build a general sense of confidence.<br /><br />When you connect with a place larger than the day to day dramas that can often swallow one up emotionally, you can live from a centered place, and that is true empowerment.<br /><br />This program is also a wonderful tool for teens to use in order to relax into sleep after a stressful day (and parents may find themselves wanting a copy for themselves as well to help them deal with their own stress).<br /><br />As with Lori Lite's other CD's, the quality of the production is top notch from the fidelity of the recording, the pacing of the individual tracks as well as the narrators and the music.<br /><br />I only wish I had a tool like this when I was going through those difficult teen years, but I am grateful that my own children have Lori Lite's CD's available for them. My almost 9 year old daughter and  12 year old son have already been using both Indigo Dreams and Indigo Ocean Dreams and now my Son can use Indigo Teen Dreams as well. I will have a copy ready for my daughter so that she'll also have this available to her when she enters those difficult years.<br /><br />Highly recommended!his when I was going through those difficult teen years, but I am grateful that my own children have Lori Lite's CD's available for them.

I am constantly reading material to learn about performance practice as well as other musical matters.   <br /> <br /> If I had to recommend one book to either students or teachers of piano this would be it. It covers a wide range of practical and interpretive matters in one very readable and unintimidating volume. <br /> <br /> Boris Berman proves to be a knowledgeable yet down to earth teacher who is able to cover a lot of ground without merely glossing over the territory. There is so much food for thought here that can nourish pianists for a long long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended!	2005-09-10

I couldn't resist the fact that he has the initials E.T. I think this is an appropriate coincidence considering his approach to \\"living in the now\\" is an \\"alien\\" concept to most people :)     I originally found out about Eckhart Tolle because of a quote in Rolf Gate's wonderful Book \\"Meditations From The Mat\\". I was intrigued and started searching for more about him. Fortunately my library has quite a bit of E.T.'s books and audio so I was able to sample his work. I was blown away!     While I had been introduced to the idea of mindfulness by such wonderful teachers such as Thich Nhat Hanh, Jon Kabot-Zinn and others, Eckhart Tolle has a way of teaching that I can connect with in a more meaningful way. He is non-sectarian and non-dogmatic. He steps on no one's \\"spiritual toes\\" and is embracing and respectful of all paths. I feel he can help us see the essence behind all religious teachings, away from the egocentric \\"us against them\\" mentality so prevalent by so many so called \\"religious\\" folks. His teaching is also not colored by religious rituals or cultural trappings.      This CD set \\"Living A Life Of Inner Peace\\" is one that I would highly recommend to those familiar with and those new to Eckhart Tolle's teaching. His wisdom as well as his sense of humor and joy come across in a way that would be impossible to get from his written works (which of course are still indispensible). In fact, I find I enjoy his written works even more because I feel I have a better sense of the character of the author. This can give one a more subtle sense that enhances the meaning of the written words since a speaker's inflections can convey so much that cannot be written in ink.     For someone who is looking for wonderful, life changing teachings from a wonderful spiritual teacher I can't think of someone I would recommend higher than Eckhart Tolle, and this set is a great place to start as well as continue with.     Also I wouldhighly recommend \\"Practicing The Power Of Now\\". It is a wonderful distillation of his longer work \\"The Power Of Now\\". It can serve as either an introduction to \\"The Power Of Now\\" or as a way to help implement the teachings found in that book. Of course the original \\"The Power Of Now\\" as well as his follow up book \\"Stillness Speaks\\" are highly recommended as well.     Namaste	2005-08-14

I have the \\"Power Of Now\\" already, but I can definitely see how much easier it is to implement the ideas in a practical way, using \\"Practicing The Power Of Now\\".  <br /> <br /> This book distills the essential principles of \\"The Power Of Now\\" in a way that is much easier to work with. They are almost like little meditations based on the principles of the larger book that let you get to the crux of the practice of \\"Being Present\\". By reading small sections of this at any given time you can be \\"reminded\\" to come back to \\"The Now\\". <br /> <br /> As far as whether it's worth getting. For about the price of an extra large pizza, you can have a resource that can nourish you for years and years (of course each year taking place one present moment at a time :) ) <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended!	2005-06-24

I quickly found myself preferring \\"Helping Your Anxious Child\\" to this one though this certainly had a lot of good information.      While this book certainly gave me a lot of insights into the nature of anxiety it seemed that some of the techniques would be much harder to implement than the approach of the other book.     Regarding relaxation techniques. This is approached in both books, but the best resource I have found for helping a young child learn relaxation techniques are the wonderful CD's by Lori Lite.         Her CD's \\"Indigo Dreams\\", \\"Indigo Ocean Dreams\\" and \\"Indigo Teen Dreams\\" are produced specifically with young children as well as teenagers in mind. They are guided meditations, affirmations, relaxation and visualization techniques that are truly suitable for kids and if you are in the same room as your kids you will benefit as well.     While the concepts contained in the above book are certainly excellent, these CD's by Ms. Lite make it considerably easier for children to relate to.       Plus they can be used to help your child sleep more soundly and can help them relax if they have bad dreams. They have very relaxing, healing music and wonderful narration that helps these wonderful stories gently lead children to a more peaceful state of mind and overall being.      Of course the material in this and the other book I mentioned are very important for dealing with the broad scope of anxiety and for knowing what tools may help. The CD's have provided an excellent and immediate safe haven for my own child as we work together on tackling the roots of her anxiety.     In fact my child was having some anxiety before school today and my wife drew a little picture of a spider and web (to represent Lori Lite's \\"affirmation web\\" which she learned from the CDs) and it helped my daughter to go to school and have a reminderthroughout the day if ever she felt anxiety starting up.	2005-05-17

Fortunately it hasn't gotten to the point where it's extreme but we want to give her tools so that it doesn't get that way. I myself have had issues with anxiety my whole life so I'm sure much of the problems stem from hereditary.      That being said, I as an adult have learned many tools such as Yoga and meditation techniques which have been incredibly helpful. Still, these techniques have been hard for me to translate in a useful way for a child this young.     This book has given me and my wife many tools to help with our daughter's anxiety issues and I am learning a lot to use for myself as well.     It is written in a way that anyone can use it, you don't need to be a therapist. The approach to realistic thinking is very realistic to implement.     One suggestion I have for those wishing to implement relaxation techniques for their children is to also look into the wonderful materials by Lori Lite. Her CD's \\"Indigo Dreams\\", \\"Indigo Ocean Dreams\\" and \\"Indigo Teen Dreams\\" are produced with young children in mind as well as teenagers. They are guided meditations, affirmations,relaxation and visualization techniques that are suitable for kids (and my wife and I have done them also).

The combination of the excellent book plus these CD's are wonderful tools to help you to help heal your anxious child.	2005-05-17

We bought this for our 8 year old daughter who tends to be somewhat anxious at night trying to get to sleep.<br /><br /> Since receiving this CD she looks forward to bedtime and she goes to sleep very easily. Bedtime is now a very positive experience for her.<br /><br /> My wife and I were searching for a long time for something to help her with bedtime and this is the answer. Even if she happens to wake up in the middle of the night, she'll just put the CD on again and it really relaxes her. We have also recently received Lori Lite's other CD \\"Indigo Ocean Dreams\\" variety, and it is wonderful as well!<br /><br /> By the way, my son who is 11 also loves both CDs (and to be honest they have put my wife and I to sleep when we've had it on).<br /><br /> Thanks to Lori Lite for helping out all the parents out there who were looking for a way to help their children with what can be a very anxious time for many kids.<br /><br /> I can't recommend this enough, the stories are fabulous and are read by the author who has a perfect, soothing and calming voice. The music is very soothing and meditative as well and compliments everything beautifully!<br /><br /> Also, for those whose children are in their teens, Lori Lite just released a new CD called Indigo Teen Dreams. It uses the same techniques but is presented in a way that is more suitable for kids in their teen years.	2005-04-30

I have been using Baron's Videos and DVD's for years and he's definitely my overall favorite instructor out there (I have over 80 Yoga programs on Video and DVD so I am very familiar with a good deal of what is out there).     My main purpose for purchasing the Bootcamp box was for the Yoga flows. I have been practicing yoga 7 days a week for about the last 8 years and am always looking for more short practices to use along with my longer practices. The three 20 minute flows \\"Vinyasa Flow\\", \\"Hip Flow\\" and \\"Core Flow\\" are wonderful sequences that anyone can fit into their daily lives. The Yoga Cards that come with the set are excellent for helping you learn and remember the poses along with the verbal instruction on the CD's.       I haven't done the 75 minute practice yet but I am looking forward to it because I have done Baron's longer video practices such as \\"Soul of Strength\\" and \\"Power and Precision\\" and they are really great (and really tough).      Still, if you did nothing else but rotated among the three different 20 minute flows on a daily basis, it would be enough to  keep you strong and flexible from head to toe. As Baron even stresses in \\"Journey Into Power\\", \\"A little bit of yoga done a lot is better than a lot of yoga done once in a while\\".       Also, I would HIGHLY recommend getting Baron's Video called \\"Transform Your Life, Yoga with Baron Baptiste\\" which is from a PBS special where he takes 40 students through a week long bootcamp. It is very inspiring and also has a bonus 20 minute \\"Power Yoga Basics\\" practice after the feature. It's a great routine and very easy to fit into any morning.     The overall Bootcamp concept is very interesting and I would love to go one one of his actual bootcamps someday, but for a very small price one can implement much of those practices right now at their home. Even if you can't devote yourself to the complete bootcamp experience, just incorporating his basic principles of eating and the yoga flows (and meditation) can make a difference in your daily life from the moment you receive the Bootcamp Box forward for the rest of your life.      The great thing about a home Yoga practice (especially a vinyasa power yoga approach which will eliminate the need for weight training) is that you NEVER have to miss a day of doing your practice. It doesn't matter what the weather is like, you don't have to drive to a gym or class, you can't make excuses for not having enough time (since anyone can spare at least 20 minutes). Just roll out your mat before you eat and shower each day and you are ready to go :)       I have even found it possible to squeeze in 20 minutes of yoga at home when I've had to be at the airport at 6 AM (which means waking up about 4:30 AM and starting my practice at about 4:40 AM  :) ). The microscopic amount of sleep you sacrifice by rising a bit earlier will be nothing compared to the benefits in terms of well being and energy you will reap from the 20 or so minutes of Yoga.  I have also found I can always bring my mat with me on trips (by folding it flat a few times rather than rolling it) and have even practiced in tight spaces in Hotel/Motel rooms.      I'm only writing all this for the purpose of emphasizing just how realistic it is to have some form of daily yoga practice under almost any circumstance.     Even if you're not up for a more physical Vinyasa practice, I'd recommend trying some of the \\"Yoga Zone\\" basics tapes (all have Two-20 minute routines which are very good, or Suzanne Deason's \\"Stress Relief Yoga For Beginners\\" which is about 20-25 minutes and will put you through a full range of movements. In the least you can do Rodney Yee's AM yoga which is about 15 minutes long, his Power Yoga Set is also quite excellent, less than 30 minutes each, \\"Stamina\\" is my favorite of the three).     Along with many of his Video/DVD programs, I also have both of Baron's books, \\"40 Days to Personal Revolution\\" (his latest) and \\"Journey Into Power\\" (my favorite of the two). I would highly recommend purchasing \\"Journey Into Power\\", it is very comprehensive and inspiring, it also has a section on a \\"Cleansing Diet\\" which if followed will not only help you lose weight but give you tremendous energy.       Since using his approach to nutrition (which is really very simple, it's based eating whole fresh foods, staying away from processed foods) I have been able to up the level of intensity of my Yoga practices, only rarely having to do a more gentle practice. This has increased my strength considerably and has built a lot of lean muscle.       So, lose the excuses, roll out your mat and jump start your day and your life!      Namaste	2005-04-23

I like the way he lays out the routines in the series of photographs in the back section of the book, very useful!<br /><br /> The excavation questions in the meditation sections are useful as well as the principles he outlines in the first part of the book. The last section is also very useful in terms of applying yoga to one's whole life and not just what happens on the mat.<br /><br /> I did find Baron's nutritional principles (\\"The Cleansing Diet\\" and \\"The Detoxifying Cleanse\\") a bit easier to follow in \\"Journey Into Power\\", but there was still much interesting \\"food for thought\\" in this new book :) Baron's approach to eating is not a \\"diet\\" in the way the word is typically used, it's just really an approach to eating vital, living and unprocessed foods along with the psychology behind your relationship to food.<br /><br />  As far as practicing Yoga, in general I feel it's much easier to work with his Video/DVD programs than any book, even those as excellent as Baron's. His video/dvd programs are the best I've seen if you want a real \\"physical\\" yet sensible practice. For me the information on the poses in the books are excellent for getting detailed information on the specific elements of the poses which can be hard to get and absorb in the flow of a class (be it live or recorded).<br /><br /> In particular I'd recommend his \\"Live\\" programs, such as \\"Core Power\\" and \\"Unlocking Athletic Power\\" which are shorter practices. Plus \\"Soul Of Strength\\" which is a longer program (and it follows the \\"Journey Into Power\\" sequence almost exactly, just a few differences.<br /><br /> His PBS special which you can buy called \\"Transform Your Life\\" is a documentary of sorts which shows 40 students on one of Baron's weeklong \\"Bootcamps\\" and it is very inspirational, it also has a fabulous 20 minute Power Yoga Basics routine which is worth the price of the tape alone, I use it all the time for a short but effective practice.<br /><br /> Also, you may want to check out Baron's \\"Bootcamp Box\\" which has two CD's (not DVD's, but the CD's are VERY easy to follow) and flash cards which contain three 20 minute practices (Vinayas Flow/Hip Flow/Core Flow) and a long 75 minute practice. It also has a small booklet that helps you structure a home \\"Bootcamp\\" weekend practice.<br /><br /> Since writing this review I have purchased and used his \\"Journey Into Power\\" Video/DVD programs and they are excellent. The level one is a wonderful introduction to Baron's approach, it certainly seems that it would be challenging for someone new to vinyasa flow, and even for an experienced person it is a nice shorter and less intense practice than the level 2 which is considerably more intense. The level 2 program follows the sequence of Baron's book \\"Journey Into Power\\" quite closely (though it is very close to \\"Soul Of Strength\\" so if you have that you may not need \\"Journey Into Power\\" Level 2)<br /> Namaste\\"Unlocking Athletic Power\\" which are shorter practices.

While I am passionate about playing and teaching classical music I also studied jazz quite intensely at Berklee College of music and took some lessons with Jazz pianist Hal Galper.<br /><br /> The reason I mention Hal, is because the approach to note grouping in this book is very similar in concept to Hals approach to creating melodic lines with forward motion. He would actually have you practice scales in a way that had forward motion by using approach notes and target notes, you wouldn't start on the tonic of the scale but would play \\"in approach\\" to the tonic.<br /><br />  I have been teaching people to improvise using these concepts since I took those lesson with Hal over 20 years ago. I know Hal has a book out called \\"Forward Motion\\" but I've not gotten to check it out yet but I'd be surprised if it also isn't fabulous.<br /><br /> Both Hal and this book \\"Note Groupings\\" are revelatory ways of looking at music.<br /><br /> Anyway, after reading \\"Note grouping\\" I was listening intensely to Alfred Brendel, whose one of my favorite pianists. I could hear him using \\"note grouping\\" in his playing. You can hear often hear him doing subtle crescendo's up to the last note before the downbeat of a measure and just as he reaches the down beat there is a feeling of dynamic resolution.<br /><br /> I think this book is a real eye opener, a way for musicians at all levels to learn to look at music in a way that will create more flow and dynamic (both in terms of dynamic level and also using rhythm dynamically in the agogic sense).<br /><br /> Highly recommended!	2005-02-01

I actually use it before lunch to regroup and it's made a huge difference in my life. Using it gives me a sense of renewal, deep rest and awareness at the same time.      It's an opportunity to start fresh again in the midst of my day. Also, because it's not a meditation that requires a mantra that is said \\"out loud\\" it can be done anywhere at anytime if you have a walkman type player. I've done it in airports, on planes, anywhere that you need to reconnect and come back into the present moment. Plus, once you are familiar with the program you can do it without the tape so you can do these meditations anytime and anywhere.     In particular I use the guided meditations. There are three series of guided meditations led by Sister Jina. The first is very simple \\"Breathing In, I know I am breathing in, Breathing Out, I know I am breathing Out...In...Out\\", then it's followed by \\"Deepening and Slowing the breath\\", \\"Feeling Calm and Ease\\", \\"Smiling and Releasing\\" and ends with \\"Present Moment, Wonderful Moment\\".      The second series is a body scan of sorts with the intention to cultivate gratitude for our physical bodies, gratitude for things man of us take for granted like our eyes, ears, lungs, heart etc. For example it starts \\"Aware of the hair on my head, I breathe In, Smiling to the hair on my head I breath out..... Hair... Smiling...\\" (while Hair may seem a strange place to start, I guess the idea \\"for even hair to exist is miraculous\\" in that \\"any form of existence is a miracle\\" to have gratitude for), then the meditation moves on to the eyes, ears, lungs, heart, liver, feet and ends with \\"Breathing in I know I am Breathing in, Breathing Out I know I am breathing out.....\\"      The third series is based on forgiving one's parents which is a source of much pain for many people I know. I must admit that I don't use this one because I was blessed with an unusually excellent relationshipwith my folks and so I don't have any issues here. Still, many people I know have some if not a lot of baggage with regard to their folks that they may be living with much pain that may be helped by this particular guided meditation.      The other side of the tape is a \\"Gong\\" meditation which is really  different, you basically just breath and concentrate on the sound of the gong as it is played and gradually fades out. This can be a very powerful meditation, especially if you have good speakers or headphones (which is my favorite way to use it).     Highly recommended!     Namaste	2004-12-03

I have many of Dr. Chopra's audio tapes and while I don't take everything he says at face value I try to stay open to what he says on any given program and judge the material for it's own merits.      Of course Dr. Chopra's popularity as a \\"Pop Culture Guru\\" can make it tempting to take him less seriously and write off anything he does as just another way for him to make a buck. Sometimes I myself feel this way due to the \\"factory-like\\" volume of materials that have come out under his authorship. Also, I do find that Deepak can get somewhat repetitive in much of his talk about \\"Cybernetic Feedback Loops\\" and the like :)      Still, I always feel that if there's even one idea that can be helpful it is worth the effort and I generally get some benefit out of Deepak's work which is what led me to check this out.     What I found on this particular program was a lot of good advice for living a healthier and less stressful life. While I'm not a scientist, it seems quite obvious that anyone with a brain and common sense would realize that if you actually follow the advice given on this program you could only realize tremendous benefits on many levels.     Perhaps the only thing that might be considered \\"hocus pocus\\" by the mainstream medical community is Dr. Chopra's use of affirmations. While I'm generally not personally drawn to use affirmations , I would have to at least admit that if an affirmation helps one to focus on something positive rather than something negative it certainly can't hurt.    As far as the claims of a program like this making you live longer, who knows, BUT it seems quite clear to me that if you follow this program you will in the least feel better during whatever time you do have. Not only that, it seems pretty logical that if you do follow the useful advice on this program and therefore improve your overall physical and mental well being that it should translate into having a longer life than if you didn't follow the advice, and there is a LOT of practical and sound advice here.    I would be wary of some of the obviously jaded and arrogant scientific criticism that I read in previous reviews listed here concerning this book. My experience with the book is that those criticisms didn't ring true. While I can understand their concerns that this book may make some bold claims which they don't feel are scientifically proven, in general it appears that scientists seem to have a very narrow window that they look through and if it doesn't fit their world view then they think it's false.      The danger is that they think their world view is one based on facts, but perhaps they fail to realize or admit that they are limited by their current level of understanding, methods and equipment.      It wasn't so long ago that Newton was THE voice of physics and Quantum physics didn't exist as a scientific discipline. It wasn't so long ago that Galileo was given quite a hard time for views that are obvious to us now. There are other world views out there, that are equally valid. There are also many other approaches to well being that have been working for thousands of years, long before there was the American Medical Association and the like.     Likewise it also always amazes me how many doctors like to write off certain healing anomalies as a \\"placebo effect\\". What they fail to admit is that the whole notion of a \\"placebo effect\\" in and of itself is quite miraculous and shows that there are possibilities beyond what many Western doctors and scientists would like to admit is possible. Just because they can't quantify it doesn't make it invalid.    All that being said :)    Aside from the \\"Affirmations\\", this book is actually very grounded and filled with excellent and practical advice and one doesn't need to have a Ph.D. in aging to realize it's benefits. Anyone who \\"has a body\\" and common sense can benefit by good nutrition, exercise and stress reduction and therefore can benefit by the information in this program.    This book IS by the way co-authored by two doctors, one of which is Dr. David Simon. Dr. Simon was trained in neurology but came to feel the limitations of Western medicine as a sole healing modality. His search has led him to an integrative approach utilizing the best of so called \\"Conventional\\" and \\"Alternative\\" disciplines.      I am currently reading two of his books \\"Vital Energy\\" and \\"Wisdom of Healing\\" which are excellent. I was first exposed to Dr. Simon through a 12 tape audio program he did with Deepak Chopra called \\"Training the mind, Healing the Body\\" which is fascinating and very helpful. I was deeply impressed with Dr. Simon's deep knowledge, obvious sincerity, and compassion. After encountering that program I started searching out more of his materials which have all been outstanding!	2004-11-28
US	47059390	RFCDL0OPDC3BD	0060536853	792465424	The Lost Art of Compassion: Discovering the Practice of Happiness in the Meeting of Buddhism and Psychology	Books	5	47	53	N	N	Psychology and Tibetan Buddhism Meet	Overall I would have to say this is an excellent book that combines principles of Psychology and Tibetan Buddhism with the focus on practices of compassion.     There are many techniques in this book that can help to cultivate compassion as well as insights and stories that help to illustrate his various ideas. For this I gave the book 5 stars.      That being said, There are times that the author seems to slide down a \\"slippery slope\\" into the worst sort of New Age thinking. For example, he seems to think that most difficulties in relationships are caused by one's own projections.      While one's inaccurate projections may be a part of many people's relationship dynamics, I think it is unrealistic to always assume that one's difficulties in relationships are based on this idea. This is an oversimplification of the reality of many situations and a poor attempt to fit everything into a nice little box.      For example, I have many friends who were born into or married into families to whom conflict and negativity is the norm (though in the case of those who married into it their spouses may not indulge in this behavior but rather their spouse's families) and they became unwilling participants often as targets in this web of negativity. One may have compassion for why their aggressors developed such negative behavior, but to blame the recipient of this aggression by saying that somehow it is a manifestation of their own projections is absurd and not helpful. All this does is lead to unwarranted confusion and guilt in the person being victimized and traps them in a vicious cycle.      Sometimes in spite of their best efforts there is nothing they can do but \\"draw a line in the sand\\" and tell their aggressors that if they cross the line that they are no longer welcome. This  can be the most compassionate thing one can do because that can stimulate the aggressor to look at themselves in the mirror and try to help themselves. These aggressors, if given free reign (likepetty dictators), typically just get worse rather than better unless confronted firmly. It's almost like a power hungry person craving more power.      All that being said....     Overall, the material presented does offer many useful insights from ancient Tibetan Buddhist practices. If the Dalai Lama is an example of the fruits of these practices then one would have to be impressed by their potential.     Some of the practices described here are also described in the book \\"Awakening The Buddha Within\\" by Lama Surya Das (aka Jeffrey Miller) which is a fabulous book. While that is not a psychology book per se, Buddhism is very much psychological in nature in and of itself.     My favorite book that contains insights of psychology and spirituality is \\"Yoga and The Quest For The True Self\\" by Stephen Cope (also a psychotherapist as well as scholar in residence at the Kripalu Center in Massachussetts). I found that I was able to relate better to the material in that book overall than the Ladner book. Stephen Cope's book is also not only incredibly informative but is written in a style that makes it a joy to read (I am currently reading it for the 3rd time and I know it is a book that will be an ongoing part of my spiritual life).     Still, if you are interested in the meeting of psychology with spirituality, I would recommend reading and trying to incorporate many of the ideas \\"The Lost Art Of Compassion\\" into your life. It is a very readable book in terms of it's language (you won't need to read it with an unabridged dictionary by your side) and the author does seem very knowledgeable and sincere.

I have been a practicing Yogi for many years and have a library full of books, videos, tapes and CD's on Yoga, meditation, sprituality and the like.    This program by Jack Kornfield (available as a video as well as audio) is the best single place I can think of starting from if you want to begin a meditation practice..    Jack Kornfield is a perfect teacher of meditation, especially for Westerners because he approaches it in a non-sectarian way. He gets to the heart of the practice, uses clear explanations and stories to give the listener/viewer some sense of the depth of the practice. He leads the meditations in a way that gives enough guidance without becoming a distraction. He also has a very soothing voice which enhances the overall experience of the program.    The program starts with the most basic form of meditation on the breath, and leads through ever slightly more subtle forms of Vipassana Meditation.      Very Highly Recommended!      Some other related meditation programs I would highly recommend are: Plum Village Meditations w/ Thich Nhat Hanh and Sister Jina which are guided Meditations. I have been using this tape for about 7 years daily. I use it during the day prior to lunch to renew myself for the rest of the day.    Stephen Cope's \\"Yoga For Emotional Flow\\" which has 2 CD's, the 1st CD is about Yoga Philosophy and the 2nd has guided practices which I find very helpful in my life. Also check out his book \\"Yoga and The Quest for the True Self\\" which is contains the ideas of the 1st CD in an in depth manner, one of the best books I've ever read (and I'm re-reading it for the 3rd time).    Jack Kornfield has many other wonderful books and audio programs in the \\"Sounds True\\" catalogue which are wonderful, one is a more in depth series (6 tapes) on meditation called \\"The Inner Art Of Meditation\\".    Jon Kabot-Zinn is a wonderful teacher as well. See his \\"Meditation for Optimum Health w/ Andrew Weil, as well as Andrew Weils audio, \\"Breathing, the MasterKey To Healing\\" which is very much related to meditation, these are guided breathing (pranayama) exercises plus an in depth explanation as to the benefits of breath work.

Still, I would recommend it for someone who is curious about meditation and wants a non-intimidating way to get started.     Darren does speak in very conversational language which makes this (and his other books) very easy to read and learn from.     My favorite book of his is \\"Yoga and The Path Of The Urban Mystic\\". Also written in a very conversational style, it is a pretty deep book which gets into the spiritual parts of yoga and how to try to \\"live your yoga\\" both on and off the mat (it is not a posture book but rather the \\"internal part of yoga\\").      His other book \\"Spiritual Journeys Along The Yellow Brick Road\\" is also quite excellent as well. He uses the \\"Wizard Of Oz\\" story as a metaphor for the spiritual journey, it's very well written and enjoyable to read as well as insightful.     As for this meditation book, if you are new to meditation it's probably a pretty good place to start. If you've been meditating for a while, you may not get any \\"technical\\" info, but he still has some interesting personal insights from his own life and those of his students which I found enjoyable.     I would also highly recommend Jack Kornfield's audio/Video \\"Meditation For Beginners\\" (from \\"Sounds True\\"), he covers all the basics of meditation and guides you thru the practice. I find this format is much easier to work with than learning from a book. Of course a book such as the one reviewed above can certainly answer many questions and give insights that are valuable.	2004-11-12

Some may think that it's ridiculous to have a program about breathing. We all do it right?      For those of us who take breathing for granted, there is a Zen tale about a young monk who complains to his master that \\"meditating on the breath is boring\\". So the master grabs the student, holds him under water plenty long enough to make his point and then looks at the student and asks \\"Do you still think the breath is boring? \\"....  Let's just say that this fellow had a change of heart (and took a nice deep breath) :)     While this program isn't specifically a meditation program the point still remains. While it's obvious that all of us who are alive are already breathing and have been doing so our whole lives, our breathing can be either unconscious or conscious.      Likewise we can either choose to live unconsciously or consciously as well. It is to the conscious control of the breath this program deals with and if practiced regularly it can likely affect your ability to live each moment of your life more consciously as well (a nice side benefit and perhaps the most important one at that).     There is a definite connection between rate of breathing and either stress or relaxation. It is very hard to be in a complete state of stress if your breathing is slow and deep. It doesn't mean you won't encounter stressful events, but you can certainly let them take less of a physical toll on you even when you are dealing with unavoidable stressful situations by not letting your breathing put you into overload.     Becoming relaxed doesn't mean you have to be isolated from the world or zoning out, rather you can be active and functioning but still be relaxed internally by learning to work with your breath. You can also become energized by learning breathwork as well, it depends on the technique(s) you apply.     Dr. Weil does an excellent job first of explaining about the connection of breath to physical (and emotional/mental)well being as well as giving examples of case studies. This is done on the first cassette. The second cassette has guided breathing exercises that are very easy to follow and are quite useful.     I personally find that Dr. Weil is very good at putting things in a way that are very down to earth as well as user friendly. He doesn't claim to be some enlightened master or Guru, just a Doctor who has seen this stuff work in real life with real patients.      I've been working with these tapes for several weeks now and they are tremendous tools that you can work with anytime you need to reconnect with your life force. Whether you want to think of the breath as strictly a physical entity or get into the more metaphysical ideas of thinking of it as prana, there is no doubt that breathing is THE master key to being present and feeling alive.      This program, if used as intended, can definitely help give you control over your ability to regulate your stress levels by using breath work, this can certainly only bring positive health benefits.      It is common knowledge to healers of all modalities (be they \\"conventional\\" or \\"alternative\\"), that stress can profoundly weaken one's immune system and lead to ill health. Breath work can reduce stress and not only make you feel better physically, but improve the overall quality of your life. Let's face it, life is not of a high quality if you're stressed out and exhausted.     So, here is a wonderful tool that is practical and easy to use, all you need to do is make a choice whether to use this tool or just continue on your frantic, stressed out merry way.     One more thing, this sort of breath work is an excellent bridge to developing a meditation practice.	2004-10-25

Meditation can be very intimidating to those who have never done it before. Even someone like myself who has been doing yoga for many years and has a degree of experience with meditation can benefit from the guidance of a special teacher. Sherri Baptiste Freeman is such a teacher. <br /> <br />I was fortunate enough to discover her \\"Baptiste Power Of Yoga\\" video about a year ago and it is one of the best I've ever done (and I have over 70 at this point) so when I found out she had produced a Meditation CD I was VERY interested. <br /> <br />As I expected, her meditation CD is as wonderful as her Yoga video (which is also now available in DVD and includes the meditation as a bonus, the Soundtrack from this Meditation Video is also available on CD which is a very convenient way to work with it if you are traveling or like to do meditation in a room where there is no DVD/VHS player available). <br /> <br />Here's a basic overview of the meditation program. <br /> <br />Sherri first leads you through a body scan to bring your awareness to each part of your body, sensing and relaxing each part. Starting with the body like this is something that I find to be very effective for several reasons. <br /> <br />1st: it's much more tangible to start with the body rather than the mind. <br /> <br />2nd: by moving through the body and relaxing each part you can release tension from the body which makes it easier to move into the next deeper phase of meditation. <br /> <br />What is wonderful about Sherri's approach is that she gives you enough instruction to bring you to the point when you are about to go into the deepest phase of the meditation and then she leaves a lot of \\"space\\" where all you hear is the gentle background of nature. <br /> <br />Also her voice is very soft and warm which also helps to lead you into the meditative state. <br /> <br />At the end of the more spacious section she gently brings you back and leads you out of the meditation. <br /> <br />This session is roughly 20 minutes or so which makes it very practical to work with while still plenty long enough to go deep into the practice. It is also an excellent length to use following an asana practice (and is a perfect compliment to her Yoga program). <br /> <br /> <br />Highly recommended! <br /> <br />Namaste	2004-10-20

I gave this Yoga Card Set 4 Stars in spite of my comments in the Title. <br /> <br /> Overall I really do like the way the structure of the set works. Their are many really interesting poses, some I've not seen before (and I've been doing Yoga daily for 7 years, have a great teacher, a library of Yoga books and over 70 videos).   <br />  <br /> I like using the idea that she grouped \\"like\\" poses by colour, these are categorized by the type of movements they use (forward bends, back bends etc). This helps a lot with structuring the sequence of the poses and gives a lot of room for creativity in structuring one's practice. <br /> <br /> The little companion book is nicely written and clear as far as how to use the cards and considerations for sequencing. However the cards themselves are not very user friendly. The pictures are vague drawings and often don't seem to be showing what the written instructions often indicate. Even the instructions themselves are not very clear on many of the cards either. <br /> <br /> What would have been nice is if the book had each pose with a detailed description of the pose plus photographs, then the cards could just be used as summaries. Unfortunately because you are limited to the small amount of instruction on the cards you don't get enough information to work with. <br /> <br /> As a person with a lot of experience with Yoga I feel that at least sometimes I can \\"read between the lines\\" to a point and yet there are still some things that leave me confused. I think someone without any experience of yoga would be completely lost. <br /> <br /> Still, I gave the four stars because I have found benefits to this set overall in spite of it's shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Namaste	2004-10-15

It is filled with wonderful music, thoughtful, sincere narration by Deepak and is filled with many insights that can help one remember truths about ourselves. <br /> <br /> While I will be the first to admit that I don't take everything Deepak Chopra says at face value. Often I feel he is an excellent \\"compiler\\" of ideas but not necessarily very spiritually evolved himself (which he has implied himself on programs I have). He is not only excellent at compiling but he is very adept at bridging the ancient with the modern, the sages with the Quantum physicists in a way that anyone can understand. For this alone I think he deserves deep praise. <br /> <br />   I've used this program to help me reconnect with my true self and go within, to remind myself of deeper aspects of myself and those around me. <br /> <br />   It's a nice transition to use for meditation as well, especially if you're stressed and need to be eased in gently. Of course I'd recommend doing Yoga for that purpose as well or even playing this tape while doing gentle poses to help create an atmosphere of centeredness while reminding one of these truths. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> Namaste	2004-10-11

It is written in an objective scholarly manner which is rigorous in detail yet incredibly readable.     He doesn't try to sell you on any point of view, he presents the evidence (which is quite compelling) and also explains rebirth in terms both Spiritual as well as Psychological.     I originally bought this book many years ago after hearing the last part of an interview w/ Christopher Bache on the radio. I was so blown away by his honesty and integrity regarding the subject that I ordered the book immediately.     The book far exceeded my expectations in every way.      Unlike Gary Zukav's book \\"Seat of the Soul\\" which is interesting but doesn't give the reader any data in which to understand where he bases his statements, \\"Lifecycles\\" is written from a scholarly perspective with loads of carefully scrutinized documentation.     It's approach is \\"here is the data (and it's very substantial), here are various points of view regarding rebirth throughout history (including discussions of karma), you are left to then come to your own conclusions based on the material presented.

I think it's helpful to be able to see how others have been affected by their practice and how they integrate it into their lives.     I am a practicing \\"Suburban Yogi\\" who has been on a spiritual path for as long as I can remember, but being a person who is very much a householder with a family, job, mortgage and other responsibilities it can be very difficult to stay grounded on the path. I don't live in solitude in a cave in the himalayas but in Suburban Tennessee (originally from Suburban New York) so I'm very much in the \\"real world\\".      I found this book is very helpful because the chapters which feature various spiritual seekers are short enough to be able to read in a short sitting and yet deep enough to help give me inspiration in my own life.     I feel that those folks who are featured in the book really opened themselves up honestly and shared from their hearts their own struggles and growth as they have lived and continue to live their practice the best that they can.     If you like this sort of book then I think you'll love this one by Stephen Cope.      Another book of Interviews that I would also recommend is \\"Yogi Bare\\" by Philip Self which contains interviews with many well known Yoga Teachers in the west.     Still other books that are different in format but are still wonderful books that deal with living your yoga and not just the asana/pranayama part (but still related to those things as well) , are: \\"Meditations from the Mat\\" by Rolf Gates.\\"Yoga and the Quest for the True Self\\" by Stephen Cope (the author of the above book), \\"Yoga and The Path of The Urban Mystic\\" by Darren John Main (see also his \\"Spritual Journeys Along The Yellow Brick Road\\"), \\"Bringing Yoga To Life\\" by Donna Farhi, \\"The Tree Of Yoga\\" by BKS Iyengar to name other books that I found excellent.

That is, he (Gary Zukav) makes many statements without backing them up with any explanations about where this material came from. Are these statements based on personal experience or by material gathered from other authors/researchers ???? <br /> <br /> To use one example: Zukav talks about animals not having individual souls but rather all being part of one larger animal soul. Yet, I have personally had a powerful experience that would certainly disagree with his statement.  <br /> <br /> As strange as this story may sound (and it would sound strange even to me had I not experienced it myself), we had a relatively young Yorkshire Terrior who died as the result of an accident. My wife, children and I were very attached to this little dog, she was a real member of the family who would sleep next to my son's bed because she loved him so much. <br /> <br />Anyway, the very next day after the accident, while we were all distraught and still in shock, a Chow showed up at our house (who had never been there before) and sat on our walk in front of my house. This dog wouldn't leave and just sat there staring at our door. After we went out and spent some time with it, we all felt that a lot of the sadness lifted. I remember feeling very light compared to just moments before the dog had arrived. This Chow then left (as if it's job was complete). A month later we got a new puppy for my Son's birthday and this dog has turned out to be very similar in personality to our previous dog. It was as if the Chow was somehow letting us know that \\"All was okay, that we'd somehow be reunited with our other dog in some way\\".  <br /> <br />I also have friends who also havehad similar such experiences with animals that they were very close to after those pets passed on and apparently there is much written about this sort of thing. <br /> <br />While perhaps it could be explained somehow in the context of an \\"overall\\" animal soul, it sure seemed that our connection with the particular dog that we loved so much and lost so tragically, and the events connected with it appear to be much more specific in nature than in the way Mr. Zukav talked about the \\"larger animal soul\\". <br /> <br />This is one example where Zukav's book made a statement, didn't back it up with any additional information, and yet I personally have had a personal experience that ran completely contrary to his statement. This sort of thing runs throughout the book which basically is a way of asking the reader to accept his \\"opinions\\" as if it were incontrovertible fact. <br /> <br />I could counterpoint this style of writing with that of Christopher Bache's book \\"Lifecycles\\" which is a book on reincarnation which has tremendous amounts of heavily scrutinized evidence from which he draws his conclusions. Bache doesn't ask the reader (listener) to commit intellectual suicide. Zukav often comes across with the same arrogance as an evangelist. <br /> <br />Much of the material also seemed very similar to much of Wayne Dyer's material along the same lines. To me, Dyer has gotten too new agey, where his very early material (Erroneous Zones in particular) was quite excellent and \\"real life\\" useful. In many of Dyer's later material I find that he contradicts himself all over the place from one program to the next. Anyway, it seemed that often in \\"Seat of the Soul\\" that Zukav was paraphrasing Dyer and that concerned me a bit. I don't know if this was just coincidental or not but the material is really close. <br /> <br />Anyway, all that being said, I still think that overall, the good outweighs the bad. If you can take the useful material and apply it to your life, certainly it could only be positive. I actually bought \\"Thoughts from the Seat Of The Soul\\" because it appears to contain the things I think are most useful to one's actual life that were expounded upon in \\"Seat Of The Soul\\". <br /> <br />I for one actually do have a very open mind, am a serious Yoga practitioner with a strong affinity for the Mystics of all faiths. I believe that reincarnation for example is a very strong possibility and believe that all of the worlds religions, (especially if you read the mystics of those religions), are saying the same basic thing. So many of the fundamental ideas presented by Zukav aren't what put me off but rather his presentation of the material which to me lacked detail and depth. <br /> <br />Namaste	2004-08-08

It is truly empowering in the best sense of the idea. It comes down to the fact that you are a &quot;choice making individual&quot;. No matter what the situation is that comes up you can still choose how to react to it. <br /> To illustrate... I used to believe that I had certain tendencies (like &quot;worrying&quot; about all the &quot;what ifs&quot; for example) that were somehow out of my control. The idea of buying into the idea that some things were just &quot;family traits&quot; that I was helplessly born into, that &quot;we come from a family of neurotic people who worry&quot;.<br /> I have a particular favorite story which is on the audio tape version of the book (I can't remember if it's in the printed version of the book.... the audio seems pretty much like he's extemporizing on the principles outlined in the book). He tells of how he was in a restaurant and the manager/owner of the restaurant is getting very upset and emotional at an employee. Dr. Dyer says to the guy something like &quot;Look at yourself, you're going to give your self a heart attack by the time your fifty&quot; to which the gentleman replies &quot;I am fifty two and I had a heart attack two years ago&quot; to which Dr. Dyer says something like &quot;Then why do you do this to yourself ? &quot; to which the fellow says &quot;What do you want from me.... I'm Italian !&quot; ..... as if that was an explanation for why he was getting himself all worked up.<br />  Wayne really helps one realize that they don't have to &quot;buy into&quot; feeling like they are helpless victims of their cultural background, family dynamics and, Genetic tendencies etc. While these may all seem to be the same thing there are in fact subtle differences between them.<BR>  <BR> I have recommended this book and it's audio version for countless people who have felt &quot;out of control&quot; oftheir emotions.<br /> The ideas in this book really work if you are willing to finally let go of the mental crap in your life that is holding you back from being happier and healthier in every way. This is not to put on Rose Colored glasses, but to be able to &quot;catch yourself&quot; before you go into reacting the way you &quot;always do&quot; and really asking yourself if it is necessary.<br /> Of course there are things in life where &quot;worry&quot; (for example if a loved one is ill) might be an unavoidable and compassionate emotion. But I'm talking about the sort of &quot;worry&quot; that is about things that &quot;might happen&quot;. How many people spin endless tales of woe that will never come to pass.<br /> Regarding Waynes other work, much of it has gone the way of the worst sort of New Age thought.<br /> While I personally think that there is much New Age thinking that can be beneficial (especially in terms of having people more accepting of others rather than being narrow minded and bigotted),  often it seems to be used to avoid having compassion (as in the idea that &quot;Everything is perfect&quot; so why help starving people). <br /> This being said, &quot;Erroneous Zones&quot; is still one of those books I will always recommend and re-read (or listen to) when I find myself slipping into old mental habit patterns.<br /> Another book along these lines that I also highly recommend is &quot;Full Catastrophe Living&quot; by Jon Kabot Zinn.	2004-07-18

I found his analysis of the characters to be believable and useful in terms of being able to apply them to my own understanding of the complexities of life.<br /> Darren uses examples from his own and other's lives to illustrate the points throughout the book.

I was really drawn into her music and wanted to learn more about what I was listening to. This music and the sound of the language has had a very powerful effect on me. <br /> I found this 2 tape program to be an excellent introduction to Mantra. I have since bought two of his books (&quot;Healing Mantras&quot; and &quot;Shakti Mantras&quot;) because I found this author to be very knowledgeable about this subject.<br /> He gives a good amount of background on mantra, including aspects of the philosophical system that is related to this practice as well. <br /> While I can't speak personally as to whether certain results can be acheived by specific mantras, surely the meditative aspect of Mantras is surely beneficial in and of itself.<br /> The author usually repeats each mantra about 3 times before explaining each one in detail. This lets you get a feel for the pronunciation as well as the overall meaning of each mantra that is presented here.<br /> I liked this program and author enough that I would like to eventually get the longer audio program he has done for Sounds True.<br />   My only very slight criticism, and it's a small and strictly personal one, is that the author seems very mechanical in his rendering of the mantras. However, I would have to admit that from a teaching standpoint this is perhaps the best approach as he is focusing on clarity of pronounciation rather than passion here :)<br /> Highly recommended!<br /> Namaste	2004-06-20

This is a book that many Western practitioners of yoga might find speaks to them in very clear language. This book focuses on the more viceral emotional elements of Yoga as a practice that is not only based on the postures.<br /> Though this is not an in depth manual for learning the physical postures, it does have some sequenced practices that can be used for different purposes (such as energizing, or tonifying etc.). Her asana practice sections are very sound incorporating dynamic movement  (where you move into and out of poses several times with the breath). This stays true to her viniyoga roots (she is a student of Gary Kraftsow I believe who is the most well known teacher of Viniyoga in the west). Viniyoga is a practice taught by TKV Desikachar (which was developed by Deskachar's father T. Krishnamacharya who was also the teacher of B.K.S. Iyengar, P. Jois and others).<br /> I particularly like her section on Pranayama. It's simple and concise and very user friendly. You can apply the techniques quite easily whereas some books on Pranayama are a bit \\"long winded\\" :)<br />Also, she has a section called \\"An Emotional Walkabout\\" which is a series of questions that relate to her eight limbed approach and I think it is very helpful. It helps you work through any particular situation you may be dealing with.<br />Basically you really look at whatever you are dealing with from various angles (there are options within each eight steps so that you can use that which is most suitable to your situation) and the purpose is that it helps you really integrate the situation in a skillful \\"real life\\" way. This may be used to come to grips with (perhaps accepting) something you are dealing with or it may be used to let go of unskillful emotions regarding something. This lets you integrate it, learn from it and move on from it.<br />Anyway, If you are interested in giving yourself another way of looking at the deeper practices of Yoga,  then I think this would be a very worthwhile book for you. Bija Bennett definitely has a distinctive personality and perspective to this ancient practice.<br />Also recommended are Stephen Copes \\"Yoga and The Quest For The True Self\\" (and his companion CD's \\"Yoga For Emotional Flow\\" which are excellent), Darren John Main's \\"Yoga and The Path of The Urban Mystic\\" and Donna Farhi's \\"Bringing Yoga To Life\\".

Instead what I found was that while it is very informative in terms of describing his experience with a couple ashrams run by Sivananda (along with some yogic philosophy as well), it also was full of personality. <br /> He definitely breaks through the stereotypes folks might have of the world inside an ashram. Many folks may relate the idea of an ashram with the image of Hari Krishna devotees w/ shaved heads dancing and chanting on street corners w/ little finger cymbals. <br /> Rather, Mr. Ittner sheds some much needed light into the down to earth workings of the ashram. He shows how the days are structured  as well as how the participants help the ashram function through Karma Yoga work in addition to meditation, asana practice and other aspects of life at an ashram.<br /> It made me think very much how I would possibly consider taking a week at an ashram (the one in Jamaica sounded particularly inviting:) ) at some point in the future.<br /> Mr. Ittner writing is full of a real warmth as well as a sense of humor on this journey which we are invited to take with him. It's very conversational, much like having one friend share his experiences with another friend.<br /> A very worthwhile read!<br /> Namaste	2004-01-07

I would almost say it's a must read for serious students of yoga who want to go &quot;beyond the postures&quot;.<br /> It approaches yoga practice as a gateway to the internal, as a way of making a deeper connection with oneself and discovering themselves through the practice of yoga. This isn't a book on asana (postures) so if you are looking for that this book is not what you need, rather look into books such as Erich Shiffman's &quot;Yoga The Spirit And Practice Of Moving Into Stillness&quot; , Donna Farhi &quot;Yoga Mind, Body &amp; Spirit: A Return to Wholeness&quot; which are both excellent books on learning Asana as well as the deeper aspects as well.<br /> The author writes with openness about his own experiences, and does not try to come across as all wise and knowing, but rather someone who himself is very much &quot;in process&quot;.<br /> I highly recommend this as a book for those who are looking to take their practice of yoga beyond the physical.<br /> Another book I would highly recommend is Stephen Cope's &quot;Yoga and The Quest For The True Self&quot; which also is focused on the internal aspects of yoga. This book actually goes (in my opinion) even deeper than the Phoenix Rising book in terms of covering the psychological aspects in a much more in depth way and it's just a wonderful companion to have to help you deepen your practice. <br /> Also, check out &quot;Bringing Yoga to Life : The Everyday Practice of Enlightened Living&quot; by Donna Farhi which is also a book on the internal and life changing practices of yoga.<br /> Still, that is to take nothing away from &quot;Phoenix Rising Yoga Therapy&quot; which is definitely a book I would highly recommend to those looking to go further on their path.	2003-12-19

Yoga and the Quest for the True Self is definitely one of the best (if not the best) and most useful books I've ever read. It truly speaks to developing a mature, real life approach to spirituality.<br />Stephen Cope writes from a perspective that I feel really speaks to the Western spiritual seeker. He combines his experience and knowledge as a psychotherapist with his knowledge of Yoga and other spiritual paths.<br />  While Yoga is a path of union, it appears only too clear that without removing the layers of psychological baggage, union with the divine cannot truly mainfest in ones life. All of the spiritual insights and epiphanies will never be more than a transparent veil placed thinly over the unresolved baggage. Insights without fertile ground to take root will soon fade or be used as another vehicle for ego building.<br /> The author makes clear that the mature path of Yoga is not one of renunciation, or a solitary journey, but explains that \\"as spiritual practice matured in India there arose a radical new understanding of the paradox of action and inaction. This was the doctrine of inaction in action, and goes further to explain that Krishna teaches in the \\"Gita\\" to \\"Act in the world in alignment with your true vocation, your true self etc.....\\" Clearly not a path of renunciation or a solitary path but one that involves action IN the world.<br /> I found this book really spoke to me as a person on the spiritual path in a way that is truly transformative and not just a bunch of religious dogma. Using his own personal experiences and the experiences of other seekers throughout the book, he has woven a beautifully written guide that is really eye opening and practical. It clearly put into perspective many things that I have either personally struggled with or wondered about.<br /> Stephen Cope makes no claims to be an enlightened master with \\"wisdom from on high\\"nor is he trying to \\"convert\\" anyone to a particular spiritual path. He explains how the various tools of yoga can help us become more in touch with our true selves. How the process and practice of Hatha Yoga for example, isn't just physical exercise but a spiritual and yet practical process that can help people grow by becoming grounded in their own bodies. At the same time one can work at developing their witness consciousness thru the process of Hatha Yoga.<br />Of the many things I took away from the book, one particularly valuable was the \\"mantra\\" Breathe, Relax, Feel, Watch, Allow\\" which can be used in Hatha Yoga practice, meditation, or even in one's ordinary life when they are scattered and want to become grounded, focused and internally centered.<br />  Some have mistakenly concluded that the author's final assessment is that all of his spiritual practice was for nothing. While there is a \\"moment\\" in the book where Cope leaves in the middle of a retreat, a retreat that he had preconceived notions of it's outcome , that is not by any means the conclusion of the book. Actually the crux of what Stephen Cope comes to realize after refelecting on his10 years or so of practice is that \\"In the entire path of yoga, there is really only one lesson...... Whenever we relinquish our craving, clinging and grasping, whenever we stop the war with reality and are totally present and undivided, we are immediately in union with our true nature\\".<br />The book also talks about the Kripalu Center and it's own growth, through the early years with founder Amrit Desai, to his (Desai's) fall from grace, and how this community matured rather than fell apart in the midst of this controversy.<br />It also explains much about the \\"false\\" Guru phenomena. In particular what happens when disciples own needs for an \\"all knowing father\\" can in their own way create a monster of their own making.<br />If you are a Yoga practitioner who wants to go \\"beyond the postures\\" as strictly physical exercise, or a spiritual seeker of any faith who wants to read a book that speaks with honesty anddepth, intelligence and insight (and to \\"real people\\") then I highly recommend this book.	2003-12-06

This is a highly practical and entertaining book that approaches yoga from a different perspective. <br /> I've been practicing Yoga for about 7 years now daily. I used to be intensely involved in weight training and I'm in much better shape and feel a hundred times better doing Yoga than I did before. There are several reasons for this.<br /> First of all, you can do Yoga every day which means you can feel great every day. In my case I vary the intensity of my practice, some days more of a power routine and other days more of a gentle approach to stay physically \\"open\\". You are truly as young as your spine is (and your joints, muscles, ligaments (etc.) as well<br /> Second, it involves whole body movements so you are not overtraining any one area. While you certainly aren't going to get the size that you will from weight training, you will get incredibly muscular everywhere. My torso has more subtle definition from daily yoga than my former weight training regimen.<br /> You also get whole body, \\"real life\\" strength. You learn to work with your body in an integrated fashion that will help you in your day to day movements. Even if you are doing very physical work you'll find you can do it more effectively because your body works  cohesively.<br />  Third, you learn how to breathe more completely. This helps with stress, fatigue and also your ability to focus.<br /> Fourth, if you do a vigorous vinyasa style of yoga several times a week (one that is continuously flowing) you CAN actually get a pretty intense cardio workout (this is my only point of disagreement with the author who thinks you still need a separate cardio practice). Sure, your heart isn't going to be pushed as hard as if you are running or biking, but from my own experience I have found tremendous cardio benefits from a vigorous yoga practice. You will push yourself enough to get a serious sweat going and raise your heart rate up to a higher yet safe rate without putting yourself into a situation of \\"overwhelm\\". <br /> While I'm sure there are many who will disagree with this, there have been studies that show that serious yoga practitioners have excellent cardio scores when tested.<br /> Of course there are multiple other benefits of yoga in general but now I want to speak about this book in particular.<br /> This book is a great introduction to yoga, whether you are a man or a woman. It has sound and clear instruction,is actually more thorough than I expected it to be, and it is a book that many men might be inclined to read who otherwise wouldn't give yoga a chance.<br /> The short vignettes throughout of various world class atheletes as well as men who do yoga just to enhance their regular lives (as well as their \\"weekend\\" sports activities) helps bring yoga into the realm of real people.<br /> My only complaint, and it's a VERY small one, is that sometimes I find that the author \\"tries too hard\\" to appeal to a certain \\"jock\\" mentality in his use of language. It seemed a bit forced to me and actually geared to a \\"locker room\\" mentality. It's not that he uses profanity, its just that he sounds like he's speaking to idiots from time to time and I found it annoying. <br /> I happen to be a huge football fan in general and a Tennessee Titans fan in particular and can assure you that if you've ever heard Eddie George speak (who is on the cover of the book) he is highly intelligent and extremely well spoken. This goes as well for many other professional atheletes (such as Defensive end for the Titans Kevin Carter, who is another Yoga Junkie).  <br /> So I would've liked the book more with less forced \\"jock talk\\" and language geared more towards intelligent men who are also sports junkies as well as interested in their physical well being.<br /> Still, the content of the book more than makes up for this shortcoming and that is why I still gave it the five stars it deserves.<br /> Highly recommended!	2003-10-28

I've been doing Yoga daily for over 7 years and have a library full of books and videos pertaining to yoga. \\"Journey Into Power\\" is perhaps the most useful of all of my books because it is real-life practical.      It is written in a way that gets to the heart of Yoga so that folks like myself (with real life jobs and families) can actually incorporate and benefit from his approach. This is not a book that is just a bunch of philosophical theory, but rather an approach to Yoga and life that is easy to practice daily.       I'm 45 years old and I'm in the best shape of my life thanks to Yoga in general and Baron's work in particular. A MAJOR key to this is the approach to nutrition that Baron clearly lays out (it is NOT a diet, just a common sense approach to nutrition which is very easy to follow). I now have incredible amounts of energy.       Before I started to eat in the way he recommends, I could only do a Power/Vinyasa practice a few times a week and alternated with a more gentle practice. Since incorporating his dietary principles I've been able to have the energy to do some form of Power Vinyasa Yoga  almost EVERY day and my more gentle practices are quite rare.       Just for the record, I generally do between 30 minutes to hour or so of Power Vinyasa Yoga 7 days a week, it's rare that I can do the 90 minutes Baron says is the ideal amount,  but he also stresses that it's better to do \\"a little yoga a lot rather than a lot of yoga once in a while\\". Trust me, if you do even 20 minutes every day you'll have life changing results.      Anyway, The increase of energy that I now have has been an earth shattering breakthrough for me. I had attributed my previous energy level to my age but now I can see just how much impact upgrading my eating has had on my health and energy level (and I was already eating a pretty clean vegetarian diet for close to 17 years).     As far as the physical side of the practice this book is laid out in a very user friendly way. There are alignment tips highlighted in blue print at the end of each more detailed explanation. This \\"summary\\" of alignment details is such a great idea that I wish all Yoga books would do this.      As wonderful as this book is, I don't know if I would use this (or any book) as my sole guide to yoga. I would suggest getting one of his videos/DVDs so that you can be led thru the sequence (of course \\"live\\" classes would be ideal, but hard to do on a daily basis, perhaps you can suppliment with classes. Home practice is the heart of developing a significant practice and it's hard to find an excuse not to practice if you can roll out your mat at home :) ).       I don't have his \\"Journey Into Power\\" Videos in particular, but I do have \\"Soul Of Strength\\" which follows the sequence of the book quite closely. I also love His \\"Unlocking Athletic Power\\" and \\"Core Power\\" which are shorter practices (under 30 minutes) which are very easy to fit in on any morning. Who can't get out of bed 30 minutes earlier to give yourself the gift of a stronger, more healthier body and calmer mind.      A particular video program by Baron that I found really helpful in implementing his ideas is \\"Transform Your Life, Yoga W/ Baron Baptiste\\" which is a documentary (PBS) that takes you on one of Baron's Bootcamps in Hawaii, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!, it also has a 20 minute routine at the end of the documentary so you get a nice short Power Yoga Practice (\\"Power Yoga Basics\\" is the title of that section).           One more thing I want to clarify regarding Baron's approach to nutrition.      His idea of the fruit fast is to detox yourself. Whether or not it is scientifically valid or not I can't say, but the main idea of the fruit fast is to give you a chance to clean out your body (and mind) for a few days. So much of eating is psychological and you can see in the video \\"Transform your life\\" (which follows the plan laid out in the book) how people who never could have imagined that they could live onfruit only for three days not only \\"survive\\" it, but totally thrive on it and feel great after 3 days of fruit.       Still, Baron says that the \\"Fruit\\" detox part of the cleansing diet is only a TINY part of his approach to diet, his main focus is on the way one would eat in their day to day lives and their relationship to food. The fruit fast is something you might only do one or two times a year (a total of 6 days in a year)and it is hardly a fast since you can eat as much fresh fruit and drink as much fruit juice as you like (tomatos and avocados are included since they are fruits).     In terms of one's normal cleansing diet, he doesn't \\"Forbid\\" folks to indulge occasionally, and in facts encourages it so that you don't have to feel deprived. He is not fanatical or dogmatic in any aspect of this program but always encourages to use ones true intuition to know what's right for you. His approach is very practical and possible for anyone who really wants to empower themselves in so many ways.     Anyway, this book is outstanding and I am grateful to Baron for making this available to those of us who are interested in taking a life changing \\"Journey into Power\\".     Namaste	2003-04-19

This book Jivamukti Yoga is very different than most yoga books in that it is about Yoga in a more holistic sense. It has some material on asana sequencing (very interesting I might add), but that is the smallest part of the book. I would also agree with others that the photographs have a lot to be desired in their size and the way they are cropped. Not user friendly at all. It seems as they were willing to sacrifice clarity for the sake of being \\"artsy\\".<br /> Jivamukti Yoga is more of an overview of the more spiritual aspects of yoga and puts the asana practice in the context of this more complete picture. It truly treats asana as just one limb of yoga practice.<br /> While I enjoyed it on many levels, I must also say that there are many times where I felt the authors got very preachy and sometimes seemed a bit off base to me. <br /> For example, Gannon and Life's view of \\"Ahimsa\\" compared to other authors on the subject. Most writing on this concept of non-harming that I've read also stresses not harming oneself, Gannon and Life don't give very much importance to this aspect of it which has a bit of a \\"martyr-like\\" attitude to it.<br /> In Desikachar's book \\"The Heart Of Yoga\\" he says (I'm paraphrasing) that \\"Ahimsa also means acting in kindness toward ourselves\\". and goes on to say for example that \\" if one is a vegetarian but are in a situation where one must eat meat in order to survive then one must do what they need to do so they can continue to take care of their family and other responsibilities\\" and goes on to say that \\"it would show a lack of consideration and arrogance to become stuck on one's principles\\". <br /> Gannon and Life often seem to be stuck on their principles which I found to be a bit of a turn off.<br /> Even Buddhist Metta practices start with the idea that one has to love themselves in a healthy way(not in a hedonistic or egotiscal way) before they can truly have space and peace in their hearts for others. Only then can people love in a pure and unconditional way as that love expands outward. How can one give what they don't have?<br /> Anyway, besides occasional somewhat \\"fanatical\\" attitudes throughout, I enjoyed this book immensely. I am currently reading it for the second time and can see that I will go back to it and re-read it many many times in spite of my occasional disagreements with the authors.<br />  I have read some complain of a lack of \\"thoroughness\\" regarding the \\"yoga philosphy\\" in this book, but in fairness to the authors, this book isn't a scholarly book on Yoga philosophy but rather an introduction that will surely open many eyes to Yoga as a broader practice than just the asanas. Most people new to the more philosophical and religious aspects of yoga practice are not going to start with Patanjali but would be better off getting the overview from a book like this.<br />  As mentioned above, for those interested, I would highly recommend Desikachar's \\"Heart of Yoga\\", which does have the \\"Yoga Sutras\\" translated at the end of the book. It is preceded by an overview of yoga philosophy prior to presenting his translation of the \\"Yoga Sutras\\" (as well as some chapters on yoga \\"asana\\" practice) to give the reader some background.<br />  Desikachar himself is the son (and student)of the late Sri T.Krishnamacharya. Krishnamacharya himself was also the teacher of Pattabhi Jois (the primary Guru and Ashtanga yoga teacher of Gannon and Life and THE most well known proponent of Ashtanga Yoga). Krishnamacharya also taught BKS Iyengar. That should be enough of an endorsement to convince anyone of Desikachar's \\"Yoga lineage\\" and credibility which would in my eyes put him in a different class than Gannon and Life. Sometimes it seems that some Westerners tend to \\"romanticize\\" their experiences in India whereas someone like Desikachar is not apt to do that since he is a native of that land.<br /> Still, regarding \\"Jivamukti Yoga\\", I still think it deserves a five star rating and Highly recommend it for those interested in this very interesting approach to yoga.<br /> Namaste	2003-04-08

This book is a wonderful source of information and inspiration!<BR> <BR>Philip Self does an outstanding job of asking questions that are truly relevant to each individual Yogi/Yogini. <br /> What you end up with throughout the book is a many petalled lotus of yoga. There are many styles of yoga represented here and the Yogi/Yogini's do bare their personal stories of what brought them to yoga, how it's affected them, their different paths to end up where they are.<br />  It's rare that you get to hear the perspectives of these folks who have and continue to make such an impact on so many others lives. Much of the personal struggles and revelations that are revealed in these pages are things that I could personally relate to on my own spiritual path. <br /> This is the sort of book that you will want to read over and over because it's not just giving you personal information about the the Yogi's/Yogini's themselves but there is much to learn from here and take into your life in addition to helping provide inspiration for your own practice.<br />Namaste.	2002-12-24

I have been doing yoga for about 5 years and this book along with Eric Schiffman's have been revelatory.<br /> Donna Farhi helps make your yoga practice more personal (in terms of how to make your practice more internal rather than external), and more spiritual. She's not afraid to talk about the deeper issues of yoga. <br /> This is a complete book of Yoga in the sense that it's not just a book about how to get your body into the proper &quot;shapes&quot;. While the asana instruction is very easy to follow and precise, it teaches you how to make the asana's come to life through &quot;the Seven moving principles&quot;. <BR>These are things that I've not seen before in any other book.<BR>  These are : <br />1. Breathe. Let the breath move you.<BR>2. Yield. Yield to the earth. <BR>3. Radiate. Move from the inside out.<BR>4. Center. Maintain the integrity of the spine.<BR>5. Support. Whatever touches the ground becomes the foundation of support for each asana.<BR>6. Align. Alignment is the clear sequential flow of force through the body.<BR>7. Engage. Engage the whole body.<br /> These principles are real eye openers and can bring the asanas alive.<br /> She also give ideas on sequencing principle and much much more.<br /> It is by far the best book on Yoga I have seen and I've read quite a few!<br />  Namaste.	2002-12-24

I had wondered after reading that book what became of Bhagavan Das.<br /> First I will say that Bhagavan Das deserves credit for his honest account of his journey. He certainly paints a picture of himself that I personally did not find too admirable and I give him credit for his honesty.<br /> This book has tremendous energy and is very hard to put down. The different experiences he has are described vividly and with focus and emotion. You feel like you are living each sentence with him as he goes through his ever changing situations.<br />  Bhagavan Das is constantly caught in a battle between the spirit and the flesh. He's almost analogous to a manic depressive who experiences extreme highs and lows, except in his<BR>case he goes between extreme devotion and extreme narcissism.<br /> I did get very disturbed by his self indulgent behavior, not just in his narcissistic drug, sex and spiritual phases but in the way he abandoned his wives and children so that he could indulge in his spiritual quest. This seemed to be a major cop-out to me. He seemed to run away from his responsibilities in the name of spirituality.<br /> Also from a spiritual standpoint he seemed too obsessed with finding spiritual experiences of &quot;bliss&quot; which seemed also a form of escapism. True spirituality (in my opinion and experience)has very little to do with &quot;states&quot; of bliss but rather are found with finding the beauty in life itself in the present moment. All the &quot;spiritual fireworks&quot; he speaks of seem to be no more than a lot of spiritual masturbation. <br /> One thing in particular I found particularly disturbing is that after his first wife Bhavani dies from an overdose he doesn't let the reader know what happens to his daughter Soma. He says that his new wife doesn't want to take her in but he doesn't seem to say anything about what he does to take care of her. Not that I need to know his personal business, but he tells you all this stuff and then never explains what happens to this poor child. Rather, he goes off on some Peyote trip and gets into his own selfish headtrip.<br /> Anyway, in spite of my personal disgust about much of his behavior, I do think this book is very worthwhile to read. I think he lays it all out there for the reader to make his own decisions about things. <br />While I certainly wouldn't take any spiritual advice from Bhagavan Das because he still seems to be anywhere but &quot;here now&quot;, I truly wish him well.	2002-01-19
