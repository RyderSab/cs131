The first is an amazing identification by Gideon about either the identity of the victim or the cause of death, based upon some strange feature of the skeleton. The sencond (and even more important) aspect of the books is the quality characterization and dialogue. The books are fun to read because of the skill of the writer, and they are interesting to read because of the skeletal mystery. Sadly, this book is neither. <br /> <br />The only bones in the story are a set of foot bones, and they are used to cast doubt on which of two brothers died ten years earlier. But rather than slowly feeding us information about the bones and then revealing their meaning at the end, the answer to the question about the bones is revealed up front. It is also not interesting. There is one twist involved, but it's sort of an afterthought. <br /> <br />And the characterization and dialogue are not up to Elkin's normal standards. Gideon and John \\"phone it in\\", so to speak, and Julie makes a cameo appearance. The suspects are all too generic, and the local cop seems nothing more than a sketch of the prototypical \\"local cop\\" in most of the Gideon stories. <br /> <br />As in the previous Gideon Oliver book, Gideon doesn't really solve the crime. In fact, he only accidentally precipitates the action. <br /> <br />This is a by-the-numbers, professionally executed, generic mystery novel -- not the excellent technical puzzle and well-crafted tale that Elkins has generally served up in the past.	2005-10-05
US	52949533	R250YL64FP49WB	0060574623	502980035	The Hallowed Hunt (Chalion, Book 3)	Books	4	54	54	N	Y	divine responsibility of kings	The Hallowed Hunt is not at all a sequel to The Curse Of Chalion or Paladin Of Souls ... and yet the new reader would almost certainly be missing quite a bit without having read those two books. The world of these books is something similar to but not quite like medieval Europe. But the religion is based upon a theology of five gods. And so is the series of books (the first one for the Daughter, the second for the Bastard, and this one for the Son). <br /> <br />There are no common characters or even settings, as Chalion is a far-off land, barely known by the people of this novel. (So calling this the third \\"Chalion Book\\" is something of a misnomer.) But in a sense The Hallowed Hunt is a direct descendent of the other books. The first one introduced the five gods and the concept that they can only work in this world when people give up their free will and let the gods use them. The second introduced something called \\"demon sorcery,\\" in which a demon (an entity of concentrated chaos) is controlled by (or controls) a human being. And this book uses those two ideas and adds another kind of theology (magic is not quite the right word to use in these novels). <br /> <br />What really sets Hallowed Hunt apart from the other two is the scope of the tale. The others involved a story of human politics interwoven with the divine, while the current book focuses nearly the entire plot on the supernatural -- the political machinations of the court and the temple are somewhat of a minor complication if not a complete red herring. <br /> <br />Instead, the book is partially a ghost story and partially an examination of medieval philosophy. What really was the \\"divine right of kings\\"? If you take it seriously that a king is annointed by the gods, then what does that mean about their responsibilities to the gods and to their subjects? When something goes wrong and the gods need a helping hand, what must the king be willing to sacrifice? <br /> <br />Unfortunately, while the theological mystery and wonder is much more complex than before, the book lacks the wonderful secondary characters that made Chalion (and to a lesser extent Paladin) really come alive. This is mainly because the three key characters interact mostly among themselves (partially due to a need for secrecy, partially because the plot demands it, but mostly because the real story takes place in the divine realm where these three interact but ordinary mortals cannot usually comprehend). <br /> <br />As with the other books in this series, the world is convincingly medieval, the characters are convincingly human, and the romantic plot (which all of them have) is convincingly mature. Because of the shift in focus to center almost exclusively on the supernatural, The Hallowed Hunt has a very different feel to it. I would rate it approximately equal to (but very different from) Paladin Of Souls, and not quite as good as Curse Of Chalion. But then, Curse Of Chalion is one of the very best novels I have ever read. This one is, perhaps, only \\"quite good\\".	2005-06-19

I assume that anyone who has read those stories will read this book no matter what the reviews say, so I guess I'll aim this review at someone coming in unfamiliar with the story. <br /> <br />(For those who are already hooked, this book lives up to all your  hopes except for one aspect -- it only tells half the story. The  book does end at a fairly natural break-point, and it is a compelling read on its own, but plot-wise it only serves to set up Book 2.) <br /> <br />So, if you don't already know the Liaden Universe, what should you expect from this book? Adventure! It is the story of a soldier (genetically bred to be a soldier) who is fighting against a remorseless enemy that plans to destroy all life in the galaxy. And worse yet, the enemy is winning. <br /> <br />The soldier decides to cast his lot with an underground group of mutineers, who he thinks are actually the best hope for defeating the enemy. <br /> <br />Then he accidently encounters a smuggler, and somehow the soldier, the smuggler, and an escaped slave end up on the run from some serious trouble. Is it the enemy? The regular high command? Someone else? <br /> <br />None of the three trust each other to share the same interests, but they do trust each other to watch their backs. The smuggler just wants to get the other two off her ship, the slave wants to find a legendary colony of escaped slaves, and the soldier wants ... well actually he is pretty closemouthed about what he wants. And about why he is carrying a tree with him wherever he goes. <br /> <br />And all of them have different groups of people hunting them, so it is not clear whether they are safer together or whether they just make a bigger target. <br /> <br />The action jumps from one planet to the next as the trio attempts to outwit their pursuers and each other. And all of this happens in the shadow of nearly certain doom for the entire galaxy. <br /> <br />The story ends at a natural break-point, but the plot is at least as unresolved as it was at the start of the novel. If you really hate that sort of thing, you might want to wait for Book 2 and read them both together. But if you just want a fast-paced adventure with some memorable characters, this book will provide what you are looking for. <br /> <br />And while you are waiting for Book 2, you can find and read all the other Liaden stories, to which this is just the prequel. I would suggest starting with the three-novel collection \\"Partners In Necessity\\". Or perhaps the pair of romances collected in \\"Pilot's Choice\\".	2005-05-15

It was written during WW2, but it is about a spy adventure the summer prior to the invasion of Poland. A husband and wife team get recruited to check out a spy chain that has become suspect. At first things seem to be going well, but then they get identified by the Nazis and must flee for their lives. <br /> <br />Along the way they meet an American journalist and a British student, each of whom has their own reasons for wanting to strike a blow against the Nazis. <br /> <br />Many of the elements used in the story are typical of MacInnes's later, more polished, work. However, the story is more of an action-thriller than the romantic character-based thriller novels that MacInnes eventually became so good at writing.	2005-04-19

For one thing, there is no romance plot. Also, there is no real central character. And the setting shifts dramatically partway through the book. It was strongly influenced by Watergate, the (one-sided?) rush towards detent, and probably most directly, the \\"Pentagon Papers.\\"    It starts out from the point of view of a Soviet deep mole, now a Congressional aide in Washington DC. He is instructed to procure a certain document. The man who procures the document is loyal to the US, but thinks the least sensitive part should be published openly. So he leaks it to the press, but he has no idea that his friend is a Soviet spy. He leaves the spy alone with the document for a short time, and the damage is done.    Then the focus shifts to the the brother and sister-in-law of the dupe who released the document. The action also shifts to Europe, where a high ranking western spy (who had to flee Russia when the document revealed his identity) is being debriefed and protected.    But the Soviet agent turns up again, and so does the brother who exposed the document. And why is the escaped agent behaving so strangely? Is he who he seems?    The action intensifies as secrets become dangerous and lies become weapons.	2005-04-16

Lots of characters are introduced, and most of them become quite interesting. Several plot threads are started up, too. And then it just ends.    Frankly, I don't think it should have been published in this form. It is about as satisfying as buying only the A-G sections of an encyclopedia.

I don't know why. There are some great non-fiction climbing authors, but the good fiction is sparse and the excellent fiction is almost non-existent.    Without a doubt, the best novel ever written about climbing is Elizabeth Coxhead's \\"One Green Bottle\\", and it can be found in this collection. Coxhead's novel follows a young woman from England's lower class who accidentally gets involved in climbing and finds not only an escape from a life of drudgery but also romance and adventure. I don't know if a non-climber would understand how perfectly Coxhead captures the climbing sub-culture, but even a non-climber should be able to love this story. Many people over the years, though, have found themselves shocked and saddened by the ending. Read it for yourself and see what you think.    Another decent novel in here is \\"The Vortex\\", a drug smuggling and climbing thriller which is what the movie \\"Cliffhanger\\" SHOULD have been like. (Cliffhanger has no connection with The Vortex.)    This book also includes Kim Stanley Robinson's \\"Mother Goddess Of The World\\", with the same characters who are in \\"Escape From Kathmandu\\".    It's been a while since I read this book, but those are the stories I remember well from it. It also includes many others, mostly short stories.	2005-01-02

The first two are really good. The \\"intercepted letter\\" is a standard plot technique, but Robinson pulls it off in the first novella as good as anyone ever has. And the rest of the story is just as good. Unfortunately, it is all downhill from there. The second story is almost as good, and then the third and fourth devolve into shambles. Robinson starts getting into his spiritual quest for the perfect form of society (eg. Mars trilogy, Antarctica, Years Of Rice And Salt, et al.). And it just doesn't work, especially with these characters. <br /> <br />But read the book for the first two stories. And who knows, the second two might fit your fancy better than they fit mine.	2005-01-02

In many ways this is a cross between a character study and a distilation of Christmas myths (all the way down to including the Jewish kid, because what Christmas story doesn't include the Jewish kid trying to deal with everyone else's holiday?). Throw in the twisted but funny Moore humor, and you have a winner. <br /> <br />THE STUPIDEST ANGEL is something approximating \\"Moore Light\\". It never quite reaches into the depths of the soul that Moore usually explores, but it has all the laugh-out-loud lines that Moore fans crave. The author excels at seeing the really funny aspects of the stupid things people think and do when they are just trying to get by in life. In the same way that Dilbert brings out the absurd comedy of the business world, Moore reveals the lunacy that governs the way people interact in more casual settings. And as usual, he twists this craziness even farther by tossing in a bit of supernatural fun. <br /> <br />Even though the plot is thin and the characters have a slightly constrained, retreaded feel to them, the book is a wholehearted success and a pleasure to read.	2004-12-23

Not only is the first book slightly better, but the second book contains a lot of plot spoilers for the first book. So, assuming you have read the first book, what's this one like? <br /> <br />Funny. Socially (and socialist) motivated. But slightly less successful than the first book. <br /> <br />The best scenes in the first book followed the action behind enemy lines. The story back in military HQ was amusing, but nowhere near as original or as involving (M*A*S*H or Catch22 did it better). The novel's highlight was the interaction between the four different types of intelligences -- bats, rats, man, and woman. With a little bit of Fluff on the side. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, most of the second book takes place with the bats, rats, Chip, and Ginny all separated from each other. And it takes place back in the home front. In other words, the best aspects of the first book are cast aside. In their place we get a bunch of farcical legal proceedings and a lot of conspiracy (both successful and not). <br /> <br />It's a funny book, and it consistently carries the plot and the characters in the same direction as they were going in the first book, but it's just not quite as magical. RATS BATS AND VATS was marvelous at playing off the interspecies misunderstandings against the romantic misunderstandings between Chip and Ginny. There is nothing that quite takes up the slack for the absence of it in THE RATS THE BATS AND THE UGLY. And the ending is more deus ex machina than the first book -- you don't quite feel like the victory has been earned. <br /> <br />There are some obvious open plot threads for a third book, but the authors will have to work a little harder to find a replacement for the romantic subplot that really made the first book work so well. And hopefully they will also continue to provide us with the wordplay and farce which they did so well inboth RATS AND BATS novels.	2004-12-18

This is one of the very best Weber novels I have ever read. The key element is that he has freed himself from the conventions which have dragged down the recent crop of Honor Harrington books. <br /> <br />First, and most importantly, there is no Honor Harrington. In one blow he solves his biggest problem -- Manticore characterization. No longer are all Maniticore characters either spineless bigots or honorable Honor-worshippers. They are free to be three-dimensional characters, with strengths and weaknesses that are completely unrelated to whether or not they are politically aligned with Honor Harrington. <br /> <br />Some of the stock villains remain -- the weak self-serving politicians, the evil and ruthless slavemasters, and even a shipload or two of former Saint-Just StateSec baddies. But even here Weber has partially restrained himself from resorting to the extreme caricatures of novels like FIELD OF DISHONOR. <br /> <br />Next, he has improved his pacing and cut down (somewhat) on the tiresome pages of dialog where various characters explain star system politics to each other. There are still some examples of this, but it is nowhere near as bad as ASHES OF VICTORY or WAR OF HONOR. <br /> <br />Most importantly, he has returned to his primary strength -- writing about the trials and tests of an honorable officer on a independent detached mission. He clearly communicates the intelligence, honesty, and courage required when making the wrong decision (or even the right one!) is going to result in loss of life. <br /> <br />Honor Harrington simply evolved into a character that Weber is not very good at writing about. When that happened to Horatio Hornblower, Forester's response was to go back to Hornblower's early years. Weber has done some of that as well, writing a few short stories in his \\"Worlds of Honor\\" series. But unlike Forester, Weber also controls the overall history of the universe he writes about, and he seems to have some plan for where it is going. Because of this, retreating to tales of Ms. Midshipman Harrington is not as attractive to him. <br /> <br />His answer is to go back to the roots of the \\"Honorverse\\" with a story about a cruiser captain and crew who do what they have to do because they are the only ones able to do it. The reward for making that decision is a very good novel, the best one Weber has published in several years.	2004-12-06

Well, sometimes to not be considered pirates. <br /> <br />In this well-paced and well-written space opera, Moon uses a traditional plot device, placing her young heroine in danger with no backup and just barely enough resources to fight her way out of it. The pacing is fast and the plot is sound. The characterization is almost entirely static and not a particular strength of the novel, but it is plenty good enough to sustain the story. <br /> <br />While this is technically the second book in the series, the first one was substantially inferior and really does not have to be read in order to enjoy the current offering. And have no doubt that this is a series -- far too many plot threads are left open at the end of the novel for it to be anything else. <br /> <br />The setting is the deep space version of the Caribbean, where trading vessels ply the spaceways between independent planets, pirates prey on the traders, and the only military/police protection available are mercenaries and privateers. The most successful of these tradeship consortiums is Vatta Transport -- until someone attacks both the Vatta family and the Vatta company in one devestating blow. At the same time, someone has also attacked the company that holds the exclusive monopoly on faster-than-light interstellar communication. Since ISC and Vatta have longstanding ties, the two attacks are almost certainly tied together. <br /> <br />With the family in shambles and all communications compromised, it falls to Ky Vatta, the young hero of TRADING IN DANGER, to somehow survive, gather up her remaining family, and strike back at whoever has attacked Vatta. Along the way she picks up a few more resources and a few more allies, but also makes a few more enemies.	2004-12-04

They are best read in order: PRELUDE TO TERROR, THE HIDDEN TARGET, and then CLOAK OF DARKNESS.  <br /> <br />Almost all of MacInnes's novels were about the struggle against either Nazism or Communism, but in this novel the focus begins to shift more towards international terrorism. While Renwick (a NATO intelligence officer looking into the connection between the Soviets and terrorism) is a major figure in the novel, the central hero is that MacInnes specialty, an amateur who just stumbles into a dangerous situation and accepts it as his patriotic duty to play the role the professionals ask of him.  <br /> <br />As always in a MacInnes novel, there is also a love interest. In this case she is an agent working for Renwick, and she falls for the amateur hero as hard as he falls for her. But love and freedom are never safe in a MacInnes novel....  <br /> <br />Unlike the usual focus of a spy novel (secrets or perhaps the identity of the spy), the focus in this story is the money trail leading from the old enemies of the west to the new enemies of the west, the terrorists. But other than that it's a typical MacInnes spy novel of Americans in Europe.	2004-11-24

Renwick is a former NATO intelligence officer who is starting a new organization, InterIntell. Like InterPol, they exist to be a clearinghouse for information, but instead of drugs they focus on terrorism.     The central figure of the novel is Nina O'Connell, a college student who accepts a friend's offer to join a round-the-world student adventure. Unbeknownst to her, she has been specifically targeted by one of the world's most dangerous terrorists. Renwick had almost captured this man, Erik, but he escaped the net. Renwick is hunting him, and he is travelling from country to country on behalf of his Soviet moneyman, recruiting new terrorist cells.    Erik wants to use Nina to get close to her father, a high level member of the State Department. Nina is torn between her attraction to \\"James\\" and a girlish crush on a man she remeets just before she starts her trip -- Robert Renwick. As the trip progresses and she starts to question the strange behavior of James and his friend Tony, Renwick starts to suspect that Nina's travelling partners may also be the terrorists he is hunting.

For one thing, the amateur hero who is the central figure is actually a heroine -- rare for MacInnes. Another change is that a significant portion of the novel actually takes place inside the CIA's Langley HQ, instead of being entirely focused on a field operation. <br /> <br />A respected journalist is invited to a Soviet propaganda conference. She would normally skip something like that, but she gets word that there may be a very special interview available if she attends. But instead of the interview she expects, she is approached by a high-level KGB officer, who wants her help in defecting to the US. <br /> <br />From there the action shifts to Rome, and another dangerous assignment, where it appears she is targeted for assasination. Is it the Russians trying to stop her from helping the defector? Or is something else going on? <br /> <br />When a plot is revealed inside the CIA itself, Peter Briscoe has to find the defector, discover the mole in his unit, and protect the reporter who provided him the information -- a reporter he is rapidly falling in love with. <br /> <br />The plot twists and twists again, as MacInnes ends her long writing career with a top tier example of her work.	2004-11-24

They also feature a romantic plot, which is linked (somehow) to the thiller plot. \\"North By Northwest\\" is almost a perfect MacInnes novel, except that it wasn't.

But ... don't start with NEITHER FIVE NOR THREE. It is one of her least appealing works.<br /><br />The problem is that none of the characters are especially sympathetic, even the central hero. She goes about as deeply into the minds of the bad guys as she does in any of her books, and it leaves you with a fairly bad taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Furthermore, the trademark romance plot is kind of stifled. The two characters who would, in most MacInnes novels, have fallen in love are actually former young lovers who have been separated by WW2. Now the woman is engaged to someone else, and the whole thing is more awkward than romantic.<br /><br />Also, the setting is before the cold war was openly being fought, so the battle lines are not as clear as they are in her other novels.

They are best read in order: PRELUDE TO TERROR, THE HIDDEN TARGET, and then CLOAK OF DARKNESS. <br /> <br />This was the penultimate novel for MacInnes. Almost all of her novels were about the struggle against either Nazism or Communism, but in this novel the focus has shifted more to international terrorism. Renwick is a former NATO intelligence officer who has started a new organization InterIntell. Like InterPol, they exist to be a clearinghouse for information, but instead of drugs they focus on terrorism. <br /> <br />It doesn't follow the normal conventions of a MacInnes novel. It is more procedural than most, because Renwick is a professional rather than her usual \\"inspired amateur\\". Also, Renwick is married, so the usual MacInnes romance plot is somewhat modified. <br /> <br />But it is a strong novel, with more than a few really surprising plot twists. (MacInnes usually doesn't rely on plot twists.) I recommend it, but do try to read the other two first.	2004-11-23

It's not so much what they say but how they say it. It is a brilliant parody of travel guides. However, just like a real travel guide, it quickly becomes boring to linearly read through.

But for some reason when I find myself drawn to rereading a Vlad novel, I usually end up choosing this one. Probably because it is not really a Vlad novel. <br /> <br />Sure, it is told from the point of view of our favorite severely emotionally handicapped assassin. And it has all the typical biting and caustic exchanges between Vlad and his only friends. But that is only the form of the book. The heart of the book is the genuine goodness of the title character. <br /> <br />She consciously redeems Vlad the same way that during the entire series he unwillingly redeems himself through his actions and his loyalty. He is a man who feels too much, and tries therefore to feel nothing. But she allows herself to feel everything, because she really believes the world is worth feeling. <br /> <br />I'm assuming here that the reader has read most or all of the novels that lead up to this one. If not, this is not the place to start from. Start with \\"Jhereg\\", or possibly \\"Taltos\\". But do get around to reading this one. I think it is worth it. <br /> <br />	2004-10-20

It's OK that he wants to answer it positively. (Apparently, he feels that he NEEDS to answer it positively.) It's OK that he presents his arguments in a way that is intended to make them convincing. But it is not OK that he falls into a very serious intellectual trap. <br /> <br />Exactly at the moment where the problem gets most interesting (and difficult), Trefil takes the easy way out and appeals to common sense and intuitive understandings. To quote Steven Brust, \\"simple things are never problems\\". And yet, Trefil seems to want to find solutions that require the problems involved to be simple. <br /> <br />For instance, he spends a whole chapter on Searle's \\"Chinese Room\\" thought experiment. Ultimately, the Chinese Room is a trick. Searle's argument turns on the question of what it is to \\"know\\" Chinese. Is it enough to speak Chinese fluently? Do you really \\"know\\" Chinese if people ask you questions in Chinese and you provide them correct answers? Most people would say \\"yes\\". But Searle's thought experiment slows that down and imagines a little man in the head who doesn't know Chinese, but just has a set of rules for listening to one set of sounds and responding with another. \\"Obviously\\" this mechanical version of the mind does not \\"understand\\" Chinese, but would pass a Turing test. <br /> <br />Trefil takes this to be a serious refutation of the computational theories of the mind, but only by not understanding the rebuttals. When it is pointed out that it would be impossible for a mechanical set of rules to actually speak fluent Chinese, he says \\"it was just a thought experiment so it doesn't have to be possible.\\" And yet, that is the entire issue! If \\"knowing\\" Chinese can be extracted from the mind and reproduced in a set of mechanical rules, then is not the mind really mechanical after all? And if it can't be done, then the \\"thought experiment\\" is actually intellectually sterile. <br /> <br />Again and again Trefil performs the same \\"bait and switch\\" in this book - setting up a discussion that is supposed to be grounded in science but which slips into fuzzy mysticism at just the moment where the science actually needs to be most grounded. <br /> <br />I doubt he would let any of his physics students pull the same stunt in the answers to their assignments.	2004-09-27

I guess it is targeted at the intelligent and somewhat skeptical reader who does not have any technical background in environmental science. The book presents a lot of useful background information, and provides a science framework for discussing several subjects that are often presented in more emotional/political terms. <br /> <br />The book works best as a tool to introduce the idea that some of these questions (global climate change, endangered species, genetic engineering) can be reasonably discussed. It is not necessary to make faith-based decisions about them based on who you want to believe - there is data available and you do not have to be a specialist to get a basic understanding of the issues. <br /> <br />However, Trefil draws several conclusions in this book which are simply unsupported by any data he presents. In his quest to simplify and condense the subjects, he has to throw out almost all of the shaded nuances. But the devil is in the details. Many of the details he skips over are big enough to completely change the answers involved. <br /> <br />This book should only be a beginning, not an end. Ideally it would serve to make people think \\"that's an interesting subject - I want to learn more about it\\". Pope said \\"a little learning is a dangerous thing\\", and that definitely applies to this book.	2004-09-27

Young female scion of a rich family gets tossed out of the local military academy for making an embarassing mistake. She gets appointed captain of one of her family's trading ships and heads off into space on a simple milk run. You know where this is going to go, and how it is going to get there. You think. <br /> <br />Interestingly, it doesn't really go where you think it might. Instead of somehow pulling off a feat of military brilliance, she simply works as hard as she can to keep her crew safe and turn a profit. <br /> <br />Sadly, that is really the only interesting aspect to the book. The universe is interchangible with any of several dozen others, the characters are all two-dimensional and barely sketched out (except for the central heroine), and the resolution is unsatisfying. It's not that the book is bad, it's just not very good. <br /> <br />The most telling problem is that the teaser for the second book in the series is more exciting and interesting than anything in the entire first book. The second biggest problem is that the most interesting character in the book is a mercenary soldier who makes only two brief appearances.	2004-09-20

Assignment In Brittany is my favorite of these early novels. <br /> <br />When an injured French civilian (rescued from Dunkirk) happens to look almost exactly like a British spy, the spy is sent over to France impersonating the Frenchman. But unbeknownst to him, the Frenchman is really a Nazi collaborator. So he gets more intelligence information than he had bargined for, but runs a much bigger risk as well. <br /> <br />The story works as kind of a cross between a spy thriller and The Return Of Martin Guerre. In particular, the spy falls in love with the fiancee of the Frenchman (an arranged marriage of convenience, not love). But he has to pretend to love the Frenchman's girlfriend, who is one of the Nazi agents. Inevitably his cover is blown, and he is forced to try and make a desperate escape. <br /> <br />The novel was written while France was occupied.	2004-09-20

The partnership seems to be settling down into a defined pattern, as Falco slowly evolves from solo detective/agent into a respectible middle-class businessman and husband. <br /> <br />The novel is really more of a legal drama than the usual Falco detective adventure. In many ways, it is the story of a couple of high-roller lawyers who are fleecing an unlucky Senator and his family, and decide to use Falco as a sacrificial goat. Falco is out of his depth, and he knows it. But unfortunately for him, he's never been one to just stand by when someone else is being abused. <br /> <br />Fortunately, there is no sign of the forced tension between Falco and Petro and Falco and Helena that marred The Jupiter Myth. The characters once more appear to be their natural selves. <br /> <br />This was a good book, but it didn't quite have the sparkle that the best Falco books have had. The missing element was the offbeat wild card characters that usually make these books so fun. There were no exotic snake charmers or troops of actors or such. Even Falco's relatives were fairly dull and conventional. <br /> <br />I think Davis is still trying to find her way to writing about the new, respectible Falco. The character had to develop, but the problem is that now that he has developed she's not sure what to do with him.	2004-08-17

Past Kaavhren Romances have started slowly, introducing a lot of characters and plot threads, then picked up in the middle, and finally come together in a definitive ending. This story (The Viscount Of Adrilankha) is exactly the same, except those three portions of the novel are split between three books. The first (Paths Of The Dead) therefore suffered greatly, because it was slow and had no payoff. The second (Lord Of Castle Black) was more entertaining, but also had no payoff. That was because the payoff comes in the third book.<br />Much is learned regarding the relationship between Love, Duty, Honor, and Friendship. A father learns that he can love his son without necessarily understanding or approving of everything he does. An empress learns the value of subjects who respect her enough to fail to show her respect. And a dragonlord learns much about his sword, as well as interior decorating and the science of throwing a party.<br />The reader, however, learns very little about Sethra Lavode, even though she is the lynchpin around which the rest of the plot revolves.<br />These three books would probably rate five stars if they were published together as a single volume, but individually none of them quite reaches that level. Neither Lord Of Castle Black nor Sethra Lavode can really be read on their own, and Paths Of The Dead really isn't worth reading on its own.	2004-06-14

At first the book feels like an alternate version of Conflict Of Honors. A young Terran, being dumped by his current ship, ends up on a fancy Liaden tradeship under the wing of the master trader.<br />But this is less of a space opera (and even more so, less of a romance) than the earlier novel. Instead it functions as a coming of age story, as Jethri grows from the youngest kid on his small ship to an independent young Junior Trader.<br />Along the way we see dozens of minor characters who are both more complex and better defined than those in the earlier novels. As befits the story, there is also no single enemy to overcome. Instead, the conflict is more internal -- Jethri is overcoming his own ignorance and prejudice. Even the token villians are understood to be small fry, not really important in themselves.<br />The huge flaw in the novel, as other reviews have mentioned, is the ending. It's as though a juggler threw 20 balls up in the air, started juggling six of them, and then said &quot;ignore those other balls, they aren't important&quot;. The Old Tech, in particular, ends up being just one giant McGuffin.<br />I'm certain that these dropped balls will be picked up again in some future continuation of this series, but even so the ending is very rough. It's almost as though they came to the point in the story where they wanted to stop, but hadn't gotten through a checklist of information they wanted to reveal. So they dumped it all out in a few pages of exposition and one lucky chance discovery, then had everyone say, &quot;OK, now we can all live happily ever after. The end.&quot; It wasn't even smooth enough to be described as a cliffhanger ending.<br />However, that was the only thing Lee and Miller botched; the rest of the novel is solid &quot;four star&quot; quality. It was especially nice to see a development ofhow trading works, and what the role of a trader and a trade ship really is. And once again I am pleased by the way the authors do very little handholding of the reader. They simply use their technology, instead of explain it to us. And yet, we can easily figure out the parts of it which we need to understand.<br />All in all, this is a good book. But it is probably really the opening chapter of a better multivolume series.	2004-05-04

It was a workable, by-the-numbers murder mystery, competantly done. This is both good and bad compared to the rest of the Anna Pigeon series -- some of the books have been spectacularly bad and some of them have been quite good. This one was ... bland.<br />The first exception was the fact that Anna was undercover. Most of the interest in the book came from this, as we got to see Anna interacting with people without the power of her badge, gun, and rank.<br />The second exception (SPOILERS) is that much of the basic story is blatently stolen, and I was disappointed to find no reference of acknowledgment of that.<br />The story of the pot plane that crashed into a lake in Yosemite and was found by a bunch of climbers is a) supposedly true (read John Long's autobiography), b) the basis of another novel called Angels Of Light, c) an influence on yet another novel called The Vortex, and d) one of the prime influences on the terrible movie Cliffhanger. In other words, the entire situation was borrowed, and there is no reference to that in this book. The closest she comes to this is a scene where Camp 4 has discovereed the wreck and she describes it as &quot;the stuff of legends&quot;. But I was expecting at least an afterwards that made some mention of the fact that this plot scenario was not original. It seemed dishonest to me.	2004-04-18

Modern engineer back in medieval Poland, with only 10 years before the invasion of the Mongols. The big weakness was that everything went so smoothly for Conrad, so there never was much tension in the plot. And the endless supply of young women who wanted to have sex with him became boring (even maybe to him!).<br />This book, a \\"prequel\\" of sorts, has all the weaknesses of the Conrad books and not a single one of their strengths. If you contrast it with a good book about the invention of time travel (eg. Thrice Upon A Time) it also loses any interest it might have been able to generate due to the subject.<br />If you are a 15-yr-old boy who can't get a date, this is the story for you.

From the beginning to the end, the novel is driven by bloodlines and the strange conflicts they can bring upon us.<br />Gideon Oliver, his wife Julie, and their friend Phil are visiting Italy. Phil and Julie are acting as tour guides, and Gideon is on vacation. Somehow you just know a few human bones are doing to pop up from a shallow grave.<br />The book is very well-written, even though the mystery plot is rather weak. Some mystery authors deliberately &quot;cheat&quot; by holding back key pieces of information, but in this case Elkins perhaps errs on the opposite side by giving away too much, too soon. Doesn't matter, though, because the book is still fun to read. The pleasure of the novel depends on the fine characterization and witty writing, not the bare bones of the plot. (Or even the bare bones that are almost incidental to the plot -- in this case the bones really only serve to bring Gideon into the mystery. They aren't really necessary to solve the crime. Either of the crimes.)<br />The real star of the investigation (and the novel) is the local carabinieri colonel, who eventually gets to fulfill the wishes of both his father and his grandfather by the end of the story. Gideon's most important impact, perhaps, is to be a catalyst and sounding board for Colonel Caravale. But that's probably as it should be. He is on vacation, after all.<br />(And as a resident of the great Pacific Northwet, I loved the final scene of the novel.

Falco gets to make fun of the colonials, and Davis gets to descibe a new setting and (often) a different cuture. But Falco shouldn't be out of town for too long at a time.<br />The Jupiter Myth was fairly well executed, but it had two major problems.<br />First of all, Falco works best when he alternates between the provinces and Rome. Two books in the same province (Body In The Bathhouse, Jupiter Myth) are too much. Especially a province where he has already been (The Silver Pigs). It is obvious that for a British author there is a certain natural appeal to setting the books in Britain, but I'd rather see Falco continue to be on the move. The endless references to Britain's weather are somewhat trying (especially to a reader from a rainy climate, like me). I want to just shake Falco and tell him, &quot;Get over it, already!&quot;<br />The second problem is the Helena dispute. It seems so forced. Falco has a rough past, but never once has he been anything but devoted to Helena since they first met. Why now would she suddenly take seriously a chance meeting with an old flame? I think Davis is looking for a substitution for the old tension between Falco and Helena from back before Falco was established enough for them to securely marry. This isn't the right way to do it, though. It just seems out of character for Helena.<br />The story was also rather grim, almost as grim as The Silver Pigs. Beloved children die, mobsters corrupt the town, problems erupt between Helena and Marcus, a very morose Petro wanders around in a funk ... it certainly is not a happy story. Even for a murder mystery.<br />On the whole, though, I liked it. Falco and Helena are still engaging characters, and their companions are all nicely three dimensional. I look forward to the return to Rome.<br />Perhaps what is needed is a new perspective. I wonder what a Falco book would be like from Helena's point of view? Or Petro's?	2003-12-10

I am only about 2/3 through Paladin Of Souls as I write this review.]<br />Is this book good? Of course it is, Bujold wrote it. She's one of the best authors writing today, and not just in this genre. But is it good Bujold? Well, it is better than Diplomatic Immunity, and Bujold is clearly at the top of her style game, but it does not reach the heights of inspiration that she hit with Curse Of Chalion or A Civil Campaign.<br />The story does not seem forced, but it does seem a bit constrained. In Curse Of Chalion, we discovered the Chalion-world (and especially their gods) as Cazaril discovered it, while in Paladin we are only rediscovering it as Ista rediscovers it. Her \\"here we go again\\" misgivings are faintly echoed by the reader's same thoughts. The issues, while not the same, are similar enough to feel slightly retreaded.<br />And the main new topic introduced (demon sorcery) is disappointing. While at least it is not traditional fantasy magic, the most brilliant thing about Curse Of Chalion is that it was a medieval fantasy novel which was \\"swords and theology\\" rather than \\"swords and sorcery\\". This new demon magic is still a theological problem rather than a magical one, but it cuts much closer to more traditional magical stories (like Bujold's unrelated The Spirit Ring).<br />On the other hand, Bujold's characters are as brilliantly drawn as ever, and her skill at anchoring them in a real world (even if it is not THE real world) has only grown with her biliography. She is still an artist improving her mastery with every work, and it shows clearly. You feel like you are there, from the descriptions of the landscape down to details like painful saddle sores and ignoble chamber pots residing under the most noble of beds.<br />The book is only slightly disappointing by the standards I have come to expect from Bujold -- it is still one of the best novels I have read this year.<br />[Dec 2003 update: I have recently reread the book, and liked it even better than before. My major concern -- the similarity in theme and subject to Curse Of Chalion -- seemed less of a problem the second time around. Being free to not worry about the plot allowed me to recognize some of the more subtle differences between the two books. It's still not quite the gem of perfection that CoC is, but this is a darn fine novel.]	2003-10-17

I think the title is deliberately misleading in that regard. It's not that I think everything Lee and Miller does has to be Liaden, but calling the book Low Port seemed a bit deceptive.<br />So much for what it is not, what about what it is? It's a short story anthology, themed around the underclass and the disadvantaged. There are good and bad things about short story anthologies, and if you like to read them you will probably like this one. If you dislike them in general, you will probably also dislike this one. There is no special link between the stories such as common characters, settings, or authors. And while Lee and Miller seem convinced that it is unusual to write about the kitchen help instead of the king and queen, I've seen plenty of other stories told from that point of view.<br />Experienced readers will know what they are getting from this book, and can decide for themselves whether or not to read it. For those unexperienced in short story anthologies, you might as well try it out. It's a pretty typical example of the format, and there are some pretty good short stories in here.	2003-10-17

Not necessarily boring, but not very interesting either.

The main difference is the reuniting of the four heroes of Phoenix Guards and 500 Years. It is fun to see what time and experience has done to them.<br />Brust starts off with a short introduction to the book which strongly makes the point that these three books should be considered a single novel. If so, things start making more sense. Both Phoenix Guards and 500 Years started off slowly, then built up to more action, and finally ended with a big finale and some strong character growth. That might explain why Paths was so ... &quot;eh&quot;, and why Lord is more fun.<br />The chapter where Morrolan visits Sethra to demand tribute from her as her liege lord is priceless, made more so because we know of their coming close relationship. Morrolan has no idea that he is talking to The Enchantress Of Dzur Mountain, and doesn't really realize what sort of a mistake he has made until ... well, read it for yourself.<br />This is not the book with which to start reading the series, but fans of PG and 5Y should find this more to their liking than Paths Of The Dead. (Paths Of The Dead is required reading to understand Lord Of Castle Black, however.)	2003-09-24

Robert Maillart was first and foremost a great engineer, but he was also a wonderful artist.<br />This book (in English and German) traces his works from 1905 to his death (about 1940). Billington shows how Maillart takes his designs, step by step, from the historical stone arch design to the modern use of reinforced concrete. His bridges are wonderfully designed to be functional as well as perfectly suited to their placement in the environment.<br />Because of their locations deep in the Swiss countryside, they tend to be difficult to view and photograph. But Billington includes excellent photographs (both historic and contemporary).<br />The best part about the book is the way Billington shows that the later works are built upon the concepts explored in the earlier works. There are some discussions of engineering concepts, but this is really a book about art and aesthetics, not about stress and strain. As Maillart proved, you can provide gorgeous aesthetics and still create structures that serve a useful purpose for 100 years (and still going strong).<br />I wish the chapter about his influence on later engineers had been more developed. I also wish there could have been more discussion of the economics involved, perhaps a detailed exploration of one of the design competitions. (Maillart had to not only build the bridges, but he also had to be the low-bidder!)	2003-09-02

If so, you will recognize immediately that Fluke is a return to his pre-Lamb format. The book it most closely resembled was Coyote Blue. It starts as a academic_science comedy/mystery, then suddenly shifts to being a science_fiction comedy/action_thriller. (Lots of slashes when trying to characterize a Moore book.)<br />As usual, the plot takes second fiddle to the comedy, and tends to have some rough edges. The characterization and comedy is first rate, some of Moore's best.<br />I rate it higher than most of his other novels, but perhaps not as good as Coyote Blue or especially Bloodsucking Fiends (still his best). There are some great laugh-out-loud lines in here, and even when the plot falls apart at the end, the humor stays as strong as ever.	2003-07-12

Weber has concentrated on things he is very bad at writing about (political intrigue, character development, romance) instead of the things he is good at writing about (swashbuckling action, mainly). He has also fallen farther and farther into his bad habit of telling us stuff instead of showing it to us.<br />But this time, the Weber story in the collection is surprisingly good. He takes a bunch of his stock characters (young female officer, less-talented but high-born young male officer, Marine non-com from San Martin, high-born and foppish captain) and deliberately plays slice and dice with the stereotypes. He actually tells a different story, for a change. Plus, there is only one three page long pointless lecture on star system political alliances.<br />Eric Flint also bends the stereotypes of State Sec in his story. I think the next Honor novel is actually going to be co-written by Weber and Flint.<br />The two John Ringo stories are played for humor, and are only nominally set in the Honorverse.<br />Timothy Zahn's story is unusual in that Weber apparently allowed him to write a backstory featuring the main Honorverse characters. Too bad they all stayed completely in their pre-established characters, because we learn nothing new about them.<br />The Jane Lindskold story is somewhat interesting for the Moses references, but otherwise reads like a journeyman attempt to \\"do a Weber story\\". I believe it will set up some characters for the next Honor novel.<br />All in all, probably the second best of the Worlds Of Honor books, and much better than the last two full Honor novels.	2003-06-20

It does not take place on the Navajo Reservation, neither Chee nor Leaphorn is really involved in the crime, and the crime really has nothing to do with Navajo culture in any way. In fact, the effort to involve them comes off as contrived.<br />While Bernie is more of a central character, she is a weak central character. All we find out about her is that she is sad and misses Jim Chee. We don't even get to see her as a very professional cop.<br />The most interesting character is actually Budge (a hatchet man for a cartoonish Very Bad Rich Guy). If only the novel had been written about him, from his viewpoint, it could have been great. As it was, it was just an OK but forgettable standard cop/mystery story.<br />It couldn't even decide if it was going to be a story about exploitation of Indian resources or about smuggling drugs. And while I support legalization of most drugs, the discussion of that in the book was heavyhanded and simplistic.<br />It really seemed as though Hillerman had a bunch of topics and series plot developments on a checklist, but was searching for a real novel to slip them into. Sadly, he came up with this threadbare framework instead.<br />The stylistic skill was as good as ever (thus the three stars), but you know what they say about putting lipstick on a pig....	2003-06-11

But this book is not part of that series, and stands on its own (so far).<br />[If you haven't read the Liaden books, I recommend starting with the compilation Partners In Necessity.]<br />What the book is: a space opera -- sort of an Indiana Jones style adventure. By that I mean that we have a male hero (extraordinarily capable but with some flaws), a female sidekick who could easily also be the hero, some evil mobsters, daring breakins, swashbuckling fight scenes, sneaky assasination fight scenes, a romantic relationship based more on battles survived together and mutual respect than instant physical attraction, and some mystical artifacts and prophecies.<br />What it is not: Liaden. Liaden novels are more like James Clavell merged with Lois Bujold, with cutthroat business and social maneuvering intermixed with military action (and with a healthy dose of telepathic wizardry). Liaden novels are more setup, strategy, and verbal banter. Tomorrow Log is more action, with our heroes bouncing from one scrape to the next and the stakes increasing every time.<br />In summary, this book has much of the style of the Liaden stories, but with a rather different content. It is not as good as the whole Liaden series (a couple hundred pages versus over a thousand), but it probably is just as good as any of those books considered one-on-one.	2003-03-13

But....<br />I have read all off Brust's other novels, and liked (or more than liked) all of them except Freedom And Necessity. For a fan, this was a fun bit of fluff. We get to see some of our favorite characters again, and get introduced to a few new ones. And if you like Parfi, you get more of him. If you don't like Parfi, you get more of him anyway.<br />But this book entirely lacks the emotional depth of a Vlad novel, to say nothing of a work like Agyar. For someone who does not know the characters involved, the book would be an exercise in frustration. There's no subtext here, just text.<br />We do get some moments of Brust-like wit and style, but without an exciting story or a deeper structure it becomes a cake which is all frosting and no cake.	2003-02-24
US	52949533	R2ENV6DREWMR6I	0688162185	38141805	Liars, Lovers, and Heroes:  What the New Brain Science Reveals About How We Become Who We Are	Books	2	56	72	N	N	bland and unconvincing	I had really hoped to find a convincing argument for what has been called &quot;the West Pole&quot;, the connectionist argument against evolutionary psychology. But, I'm afraid, this book isn't it.<br />Most of their arguments are strangely disconnected from their conclusions. The authors describe how neurons work, and make a good case for the fact that brain cells are flexible. But they really don't explain how they can therefore conclude that the brain is not extensively programmed by the genes.<br />After all, muscle cells in the arms are very similar to (and in fact replaceable by) muscle cells in the legs, but that doesn't mean evolution hasn't tailored the arms and the legs to be specialized. The fact that a person with no legs can compensate by using his arms does not mean arms and legs are defined by culture. And yet this is their argument for brains, as near as I can tell.<br />Perhaps this disconnect is because the science being discussed is reduced to very generalized and simplified results. Unfortunately, since the argument they are proposing is not really very different from the one they are opposing, it will be the details that make the difference. And yet, it is the details that the authors omit from this book.<br />Finally, when they stray from their own subject they are not very careful with the facts. For instance, John Glenn was not the first American in space, nor did he ever &quot;ride atop a Saturn rocket.&quot; The authors claim both of those things to be true, however.<br />They also introduce a chapter with the example of the kids who attacked the jogger in Central Park. Oops -- DNA evidence has now (apparently) cleared those kids and the state of New York has apologized for their prosecution. [This last one is more understandable than the John Glenn error, because the new information was discovered after this book was published. But it is an example of their arguments resting on shaky, non-scientific ground.]<br />Another claim they make (that &quot;parentese&quot; is widespread and necessary for the development of language in children) is directly disputed by the linguistics studies of the evolutionary psychologist camp. And frankly, since the linguistics books present more details and more evidence (as well as referencing more and newer studies), I am forced to conclude that these authors were probably wrong about parentese, too.<br />The biggest problem with the book, though, is the underlying problem that none of their actual scientific findings (as presented without detail in this book) are actually incompatible with evolutionary psychology. Which makes it hard to understand why they claim to have &quot;saved us from the tyranny of our genes.&quot;	2003-01-21

I have read other KSR stories, and liked some of them while disliking others.]<br />I think the many reviews of this book describing it as a study of religion or an alternate history are misguided. As with Robinson's other novels, his utopian (and distopian) political systems are best viewed as interesting hypothetical concepts. The real strength of his work is his characters and their adventures.<br />He also seems to be better at telling shorter tales. I think the episodic structure of the book plays to the author's strengths.<br />Perhaps the most interesting part of the book for me has been that the writing structure is different in each section. Sometimes chapter-based, sometimes poetic, sometimes dryly historical, but always different. The timescales also vary from section to section, sometimes covering the whole life (so to speak) of characters and sometimes only covering very short but important moments in their lives.	2003-01-02

It's certainly his most famous.<br />But this one is my favorite, I think because it is more about &quot;climbing&quot; than about &quot;Joe Simpson&quot;.<br />Simpson makes a compelling case for the idea that the ethics of mountaineering have been harmed by the commercialization of climbing.<br />I usually figure that any story about &quot;the good old days&quot; when people were noble is likely BS. But that's not really what Simpson is claiming here. Instead, he is really talking more about the differences between a small and self-selected community (like &quot;climbing&quot; 30 years ago) and a large and public activity (like &quot;climbing&quot; today).<br />I'm not sure if non-climbers would really appreciate this book, but as a climber I have found it invaluable for helping me to frame my own questions about what it means to be a climber, and ultimately a human being.	2002-11-27

She is famous for two reasons -- the quality of her bones and the story of what happened to her after she was exhumed.<br />This book tries to discuss dinosaur and T-rex science at the same time as it tells the story of Peter Larson -- who dug up Sue, spent months cleaning her off, lost her in court, then went to jail for two years on charges that never would have been pressed if not for the Sue dispute.<br />Unfortunately, this approach didn't work quite as well as the authors hoped it would.<br />The story about Larson's legal problems is horrific. In a nutshell, the government invalidated his purchase of Sue (for $5000 when she was still in the earth) on the grounds that the rancher whose land she was on did not have the right to sell her. Then they used the National Guard to take Sue (and all the business records of Larson's company). Then they searched the business records until they found something to charge him with -- incorrectly filling out his customs forms when he visited Peru. Then they threw him in jail for two years. It seems clear that they wanted to find him guilty of something to justify what they had done by stealing his dinosaur. Oh, and after all that they eventually let the rancher sell her again, this time for $8,000,000. Larson didn't even get his $5000 back.<br />But the obviously partisan story about the legal hassles distracts from the discussions of dinosaur science. And vice versa. Just when you start getting into the T-rex science, he stops talking about it and switches back to the legal problems. Then he interrupts that to talk about T-rexes again.<br />The format just didn't work for me. I ended up skimming past stuff I ordinarily would have read because I was trying to piece together the separate sections of the book. It was too irritating to read linearly.<br />Nevertheless, both the legal story and the dinosaur science are engrossing. I stayed up late at night reading it. It's not the content of the book I didn't like, it's the format.	2002-11-24

I liked the first one better.<br />The plot in The Magician's Ward is something of an afterthought. Someone is somehow absorbing the magic of wizards, including Mairelon. Kim has to solve the mystery, and use her expanding magical powers. Not very exciting, actually.<br />More important to the book is Kim's response to joining London Society, becoming 19, and realizing (surprise! -- well, not really) that she is in love with Mairelon.<br />The problem with that (for me) is that he is her legal guardian, her magical tutor, and apparently about 10-12 years older than her. None of which are actual problems in 19th century London, but they seem strange in a book written for modern young adult readers. In today's world this would be a tabloid-TV scandal, not an admired romance.<br />Like the first Mairelon book, I think the novel would have worked much better if it had been out-and-out written for an adult audience. My sense of these novels is that Wrede was trying to cram an adult romance into a young adult format.	2002-11-21

If you are already convinced that he is on the right track, you may also find this one to be a little preachy.<br />But don't get me wrong, I liked the book anyway. It covers much of the same ground as How The Mind Works, but instead of presenting the details of the computational/innate theory of the mind it discusses the social resistance to acceptance of that theory.<br />If you just want an explanation of what the computational/innate theory of the mind is, you have to plow through a lot of other stuff and you never get as much detail as in How The Mind Works. But if you want to understand the controversy over that theory, this is your book. (Keeping in mind, of course, that Pinker is a player in that controversy, not a bystander in the traditional \\"objective journalist\\" sense.)<br />The only thing that really annoyed me was excessive references to Hitler and Nazism. Part of that was inevitable, since many opponents of this theory have linked it to Nazi ideals. Pinker had to counter that directly. But it seemed like just about every chapter had some sort of explanation of how this theory opposes Nazism, Marxism, and other totalitarian philosophies. Enough already, we got the point the first ten times.	2002-11-15

But it does seem fresh and different, because it follows two brand new characters.<br />We also get a better sense of what it is like to wander around in the Enchanted forest if you are not the King of the Dragons or the King of the Enchanted Forest. All the talk in earlier books about how the forest can be a dangerous place starts to make more sense.<br />Finally, there is a sort of chaste romance that takes place, featuring just one kiss (and that one for magical purposes). It's fun to watch develop, because it seems a lot more real than the type of love-at-first-sight or hate-turns-to-love romances that fantasy books often feature.	2002-11-02

The other three Enchanted Forest books are a trilogy which serve as a single sequel to this story.<br />Kids will love it, but so will adults. Especially fans of the old Fractured Fairytales, because Wrede skewers all the fairytale conventions. Princesses are insipid and useless, knights are dense, witches are pretty and nice, dragons are ethical (but amoral), and wizards are evil and greedy (even though they look just like Gandolf).<br />The heroine is a princess who would rather learn fencing and cooking than how to spin straw into gold or get put under an enchantment so she can be rescued by a handsome prince.<br />She is a no-nonsense, capable, and smart girl.

It is not written for pre-teens.<br />A lot of the background involving 19th Century England (socially and especially in terms of occult theory) probably is not going to make a ton of sense to younger readers. In some ways the book suffers from being too realistic (aside from the existance of magic). But Wrede does not believe in talking down to her younger readers, so expect some serious themes and situations.<br />On the other hand, she doesn't take the same level of reality into the interpersonal relationships of the characters. Instead, they seem to fit in more with a book for young teens or even pre-teens. The mixture of adult writing and young adult adventure just doesn't work as well in a realistic setting as it does in Wrede's Enchanted Forest books.<br />I liked the book, but adults should really try the Enchanted Forest series first. (Since I'm 36, I won't even try to predict whether teens would like the book.)	2002-11-02

But all mystery fans know that the real fun of a mystery novel is the setting and the characters.<br />Barr's books are all set in National Parks, which is a great idea. Parks have unique problems, amazing history, and fascinating ambiance. But the kind of people who are drawn to the park service (including both Barr and her characters) tend to be self-selecting in certain ways, and Anna's politics and prejudices are annoying at times.<br />This book was the first in this series to use a setting in the same park as a previous book. That allows Barr to explore the park and its culture in a much deeper way than before, but it also gets a bit ... well ... boring. Unlike the other books, there is a sense of having \\"been there and done that\\" with the Naches Trace. This objection probably does not apply if you have not previously read \\"Deep South\\", but you really need to read that book to make any sense of this one, and I assume most people will have done so.<br />I also think Barr is weakest when she gets onto what I think of as her NPS soapbox, especially when discussing the subject of hunting. She tries to not portray the subject with total caricature, but she really doesn't seem to be capable of providing any balance or insight into the issues involved. I think she should stay away from the subject.<br />Anna's struggles with drinking and romance also make it hard for her to be a sympathetic character. That's not always necessary, of course, but the series works much better if you like Anna. And usually I do, but I was getting more than a bit frustrated with her this time around.	2002-10-31

And I'm 36, so ignore the fact that they can be found in the juvenile section of the library.<br />The books are very much like the old \\"fractured fairytales\\" of Rocky and Bullwinkle. All the fairytale standbys are here: pricesses, dragons, knights, witches, enchanted beasts, giants, magic carpets, etc. But nothing seems to be quite like the fairytales promise.<br />Giants want to retire from pillaging and complain that all Englishmen seem to be named \\"Jack\\". Flying carpets need to have their threadwork tuned up. And evil uncles (the male auxiliary of the Right Honorable Order Of Wicked Step-mothers) can actually be quite fond of their nephews.<br />Besides this, there is a nifty romance taking place. In a world where sensible people try their best to avoid fairytale romances, the best romance of all turns out to be a fairytale cliche!<br />The series is really set up as a standalone first book, and then a sequel to that which takes place over the span of a trilogy. So this novel is the first third of the sequel. But it stands alone just fine, and is my favorite of the four books.	2002-10-31

Of the four, though, this is certainly the weakest. The plot is rather formulaic, and only exists to set up the situation in the fourth book.<br />Of course, as the middle book in a trilogy (the first book really is more of a stand-alone), one can expect a certain slump. It's worth reading in order to set up book number four, and it's worth owning if you plan to buy the set. But it really wouldn't be memorable on its own.	2002-10-31

Unlike the first three or five in the series, it's not a very fun read. I guess that after about a dozen books I have some interest in figuring out where Weber plans to take the storyline. I'm certainly not reading every word of the repetative dialogue.<br />This book, like Ashes Of Victory, really needs some serious editing. The exposition is painful. For most of the book the characters simply stand around and tell each other things they already know.<br />When they are not doing that, the evil and stupid characters scheme and plot, while the good and virtuous characters sit back and make knowing statements about how the evil characters will cause everything to fall apart.<br />And pretty soon EVERY character who isn't certifiably evil will have a treecat companion. That used to be rare.<br />Once again, the good Havenites are the only characters who seem to actually be three dimensional. They have internal conflicts and distinct personalities. On the Allied side that is impossible, because every character attribute is predetermined by whether the character worships Honor or despises her.<br />[The above was written before I finished the book. The ending is much better-written than the first 80 percent of the book. When Weber finally remembers to write some plot it gets more interesting. I still think what he really needs is a good editor.]	2002-10-10

The authors constantly go on about &quot;boring&quot; hiking trails.<br />As an example, consider Perry Creek v. Mt. Dickerman. They rave about Mt. Dickerman, but suggest that you really shouldn't bother with Perry Creek. My opinion is that Perry Creek is a much more interesting trail, and also that Mt Stilliguamish and Mt Forgotten (both reached off-trail from the end of the Perry Creek trail) are much more interesting than Mt. Dickerman.<br />In summary: if you like views, try scrambling. If you like hiking, get your advice from someone else who likes hiking, not these authors.	2002-10-02

It features the traditional prince in disguise who rescues the beautiful and talented but poor and abused heroine.<br />I believe that the authors had a better feel for the second set of characters than they did for those in the first novel. The first one is really more about the courtship ritual than about the characters themselves. The second novel focuses on more heroic characters who experience a more exciting story.<br />Fair warning: both novels follow romantic traditions which include the female character being at a social and emotional disadvantage when compared to the male character (though neither female character is weak or stupid).	2002-07-18

So I wasn't forced to wait for ten years with the cliffhanger ending of Carpe Diem.<br />This is a fine story, but it suffers a bit from the &quot;middle of the series&quot; syndrome. It does not really properly set up its characters, because you are expected to have read the previous books. And it leaves many threads open, because you are expected to read I Dare.<br />As a chapter of the Agent Of Change saga it works well and is mostly self-contained. And the new character who is introduced is very interesting. (It's unfortunate that he mostly gets ignored in I Dare.)<br />As part of the series, this book is indispensible. As a stand-alone novel, it would be good but forgettable.	2002-07-18

You will be desperate to find out what happens next....<br />Now for the specifics:<br />As with each of the other novels, a new character is focused upon. This time it is Pat Rin. He shares approximately equal time with Miri and Val Con. We also get to see more of Anthora.<br />The hated Department Of Interior has their final showdown with, well, just about everybody at once. Lots of action.<br />My biggest problem with the novel is the extended Surebleak sequence, which plays out like yet another Dashiel Hammet imitation. We've seen this before, many times. MANY times. It's done reasonably well, but not with enough originality to really justify it. I found myself rereading the novel and just skipping all those chapters.<br />The second biggest problem is that Yxtrang characters get a bit shortchanged. I thought they offered a great potential, which was mostly undeveloped.<br />The third biggest problem is really more of a question: \\"Why do cat lovers always assume that everyone else buys into their fantasy?\\" But I guess if you can accept The Tree, you can also accept the cats.<br />Never fear -- the action is intense, the good guys win, and the bad guys turn out to be really evil. In the end, Clan Korval is ready to move on to new and greater adventures. As everyone knows, the reward for a job well done is ... another job. (This is NOT a cliffhanger ending. It is simply a hook on which to hang a new novel or two if the authors desire.)	2002-07-18

The plots are not quite so complicated, and the pace is faster, but the focus on interweaving conflicts of duty, profit, and romance remind me a lot of Noble House or Tai-Pan.<br />In the Liaden Universe, there are two primary rules. Don't start fights. Always finish them.<br />One thing that might throw some people off is that the authors are very strict about not &quot;explaining&quot; anything. It's up to the reader to puzzle out who the Liadens, Yxtrang, Terrans, Turtles, Clans, witches, healers, etc. are. This isn't as hard as it sounds like, because the authors want you to figure out the puzzle. And it makes the books a great re-read, since you don't have to wade through pages of exposition explaining things you already know -- it's straight into the action right away.<br />But that doesn't mean the world is constructed shoddily. Everything hangs together fairly consistantly, nothing seems to be added on as an afterthought just to advance the plot.<br />You will certainly want to read Plan B after this one -- do not read them out of order!	2002-05-28

Friends And Lovers is set in the tense pre- WW2 era; Rest And Be Thankful is set in the tense pre- Cold War era.    While politics (of nations and of art) get discussed (and moralized upon), the plot is really a straight romance.    What makes it seem dated, surprisingly enough, is its non-thriller nature. Some of the relationships and most of the dialogue (as well as the setting) didn't ring true to me when I first read the book in the 80s. These days they seem even more divorced from the current world. Almost more like reading Jane Austen.    And the relationship betwen the cowboys and the Indians sometimes seems wonderfully human, while other times seems like something out of a bad Hollywood script.    After this book MacInnes started in with her Cold War thillers and never looked back.	2002-05-14

I've read all of her public work, and have most of it on my shelves.<br />The long-awaited \\"next Miles book\\" is out, but even after a couple of years (Chalion) it has the sense to me of being not quite ready to go. The plot is straight-ahead, sort of like an early Miles book. But after the multiple viewpoints of A Civil Campaign, returning to a tight Miles focus seems limiting.<br />And the ultimate plot turns out to be, well, not up to the standards set by some of her recent work. In the end, for all the damage done, the villain is not really anything more than a petty crook.<br />I think Lois would have been better served by writing the same story from the viewpoint of Armsman Roic. This really should have been a Holmes and Watson story, especially since Roic was actually the character who I think interested Lois the most.<br />It's a good book, filled with all the ironic byplay one expects from a Bujold novel, but it seems like an uncompleted short story compared to the sweeping scale of Curse Of Chalion or the inspired plot-weaving of A Civil Campaign.<br />Mostly of interest to fans of Miles, I would think. It also seems designed to close up a few \\"frequently asked questions\\" about various people and cultures from earlier novels.	2002-05-13

He's demonstrated a fine ability to write technical murder mysteries (Gideon Oliver, Chris Norgren, the golf mysteries with his wife Charlotte), but he seems to want to write spy novels instead. And unfortunately, he's not quite as good at them.<br />The first Gideon Oliver book was a spy novel set in Europe. So was the first book in the Chris Norgren series. And so was Loot. Now we have this one.<br />It was OK, but not great. I was able to set it down halfway and only finish reading it a week later. I can't do that with Helen MacInnes novels that I have already read ten times!<br />The story is pretty typical of spy novels -- an innocent man gets caught up in intrigue, his wife disappears, he searches for her, etc. The most interesting twist is the things he learns about his wife during the process. But it's not interesting enough.<br />Please Aaron, write another mystery....	2002-05-07

Her romantic and political philosophies are just as plain as ever, but there is no thriller plot to drive them. This puts the spotlight on the romantic plot -- which is just fine. The book is a little more integrated and subtle than &quot;Rest And Be Thankful&quot;, making it my favorite of her non-thrillers. (As a point of comparison, my favorite of all her books is &quot;The Double Image&quot;.)<br />In case you want to know the plot, it's about two young college students falling in love in the years just before World War 2. We follow them from infatuation to a more mature relationship, seeing them learn from the problems they encounter along the way.<br />WW2 looms in the background, but the book ends about a year before the war actually starts.	2002-03-19

There's something about climbing that just doesn't translate well to books. But even though I've never had to break out of a prisoner of war camp just to go climbing, Benuzzi's story just seems more familiar and human than any other climbing story I've ever read. I can imagine myself on his climb, feeling like he was feeling. I don't know if a non-climber would get quite as much out of it, but the story is funny and the adventure is exciting, so give it a shot.	2002-03-19

The romantic plot and the thriller plot are not just tied together -- they drive each other at just the right moments. As with her other best work, the point of view of the story mainly lies with amateurs who have been sucked up into the world of espionage. The difference between this and some of her lesser works is mainly just perfection of style and execution. In any collection of anything, one member of the collection has to be the best. For MacInnes, this one is it.	2002-03-19

It has some quirks. Like Beckey's Guide, some routes are detailed but most routes are just simple sketches. \\"Get on this ridge, follow it to the summit.\\" Even with a topo map or on site it can be hard to figure out where to go. But then again, that's mountaineering.<br />It is not as good at describing the roads and approaches as Beckey. It does have some nice information on traverses, winter climbing, and other interesting topics.<br />[2002 Update: Peggy Goldman's 75 Scrambles discusses the Bailey Range Traverse. And Jeff Smoot's Climbing Washington's Mountains covers quite a few Olympics peaks. Both of those books relate to this one the same way that Selected Climbs relates to Beckey. They have more detail on some of the most popular summits, but this book remains the only comprehensive Olympic mountaineering guide.]	2001-04-28

While, at times, Weber still resorts to caricatures of evil in order to provide  canon fodder for Honor, overall his non-Honor characters are getting more  complex and more interesting.<br />It's almost enough to make me wish he would  just kill off Honor and Nimitz and let the rest of the story go someplace  interesting.	1999-09-28

Boukreev was the head guide for Scott Fischer's expedition, and he wrote the book mainly because he thought that  Jon Krakauer had unfairly blamed him in his book, &quot;Into Thin  Air&quot;.<br />The very interesting contrasts between the two books come  mainly from the perspectives of the authors.<br />Boukreev was one of the most  well-respected high altitude climbers in the world (he has since died in an  avalanche). He was guiding for Scott Fischer's expedition. He writes mainly  about his own team, Mountain Madness.<br />Krakauer was an accomplished  low-altitude climber who was with Rob Hall's expedition as a  client/journalist. He had no previous Himalayan experience. He writes  mainly about his own team, Adventure Consultants.<br />In &quot;Into Thin  Air&quot; Krakauer makes many comments about how Boukreev did things that  were &quot;dubious&quot; behaviors for a guide (such as climbing without  oxygen). He quotes an anonymous member of Boukreev's team as saying that  Boukreev &quot;cut and ran when they needed him most.&quot;<br />Boukreev  admits that he was more comfortable thinking of himself as a senior team  member and climbing resource than as a typical guide. However, he also  states that he was performing exactly the role that Fischer hired him to  do.<br />Neither side disputes that on the day of the summit attempt, Boukreev  fixed the ropes on the Hillary Step, was the first to summit, and started  down for camp before many of his clients arrived at the top. Neither also  disputes that Boukreev personally saved three of his clients by venturing  out from his tent that night (three times) when no one else was willing to  leave camp and rescue them.<br />But the spins they put on the agreed-upon  facts are incredibly different.<br />For instance, Krakauer says that Boukreev  carried one oxygen bottle in case of emergencies, but ditched his pack and  gave the oxygen to another guide to carry. Boukreev says he carried one  oxygen bottle in case he needed it, but when he decided he didn't need it  he gave it to the other guide, who was running low. Krakauer never mentions  that the other guide actually used the extra oxygen himself.<br />Personally,  I buy Boukreev's version. It just hangs together better. And when you look  at it, Rob Hall's group lost two guides and two clients, plus they would  have lost another client if he hadn't managed to miraculously save his own  life (though not his frostbitten hands, which were amputated).<br />On the  other hand, Scott Fischer's group lost only Fischer himself, and none of  their clients ended up permanently injured. The difference in the death  tolls are entirely due to Boukreev's rescues.<br />Now that I've read both  books, I have to say that Krakauer comes off sounding like a know-nothing  jerk, who only thinks he knew what was going on. But, and this shouldn't be  too surprising, his book is easier to read and the narrative flows  better.<br />The answers to the biggest mysteries, though, died with Rob Hall  and Scott Fischer.	1999-03-25

I find it hard to understand the other comments regarding Weber's skill at characterization. If there is anything that defines these books it is that his characters are completely flat, except for the tree cats which are just too cute and purrsome to take seriously.<br />The stories were OK, some better than others. But without the sweeping Tom Clancy elements of the regular Harrington books, it seems rather, well, pointless.<br />The best thing about Echoes Of Honor is that he is finally giving his heroes some worthwhile opponents, instead of the cardboard evildoers from the first few novels.<br />The stories in this book are generally a step backwards in that regard.	1999-03-23

First things first: I don't think the book would be very meaningful for someone who hasn't read the other books. Start with Shards Of Honor.<br />OK, now that that's out of the way, why do you like these books? If you are a  fan of Miles Naismith, mercenary admiral, then you will probably hate this  book.<br />But if you are a fan of Miles Vorkosigan, it's another must-read.  Miles is growing, trying to figure out how he will live out his life now  that he is no longer in the military. He's also trying to figure out just  what it is that he has been serving all this time.<br />It is also important  to realize that the book is not just about Miles. It is also about  Ekaterine. She is not always the strongest or best character she could be,  but who doesn't have flaws? If you think of her just as a love interest of  Miles, you are missing half the novel.<br />The next book will be even more  focused on this sort of thing, more like Jane Austen then David Weber. This  is the next step in the development of Miles. But it is definitely not  &quot;more of the same&quot;.	1999-03-23
