It gives more background on the screen character, as all books do. It's a pretty fast read, as the target audience are/was young adults. <br /> <br />This book in particular begins while Indy is in college, and about to graduate. As is his style, he gets himself into trouble, so off he goes on an adventure that's filled with intrigue and danger. <br /> <br />This book is the first of a series of books, of which this is probably my first or second favorite. They are inexpensive, and are good to come back and read periodically. I've had mine for ten years or more, the pages are all yellowed, and I've read it more times than I can count. That should say something about it.	2005-04-05

I'd been waiting for it for what seemed like forever. I own every book in the series, and was on pins and needles waiting to read it. I was devastated, well, maybe not devastated. I was upset to find out that the publisher had decided not to continue the series. <br /> <br />In this book, McCoy takes us to Egypt where Indy searches for the Book of Life, the mythical book spoken of in the bible that lists every person who ever has, and ever will live. It tells how, where and when they die, etc. Imagine how this could be used for evil! Indy does it again, and does so in smashing Indy style!	2005-04-05

It wasn't filled with edge-of-your-seat action, either. It was a very deliberate, methodical (sometimes slow) story that was filled with very true-to-life characters.     Jamie Waterman, a geologist, earns a seat on an expedition to the red planet. In doing so, he makes a few 'enemies', but also some strong allies. He starts out as an afterthought, and ends up essentially as the 'leader' of the expedition through sheer will and determination.    The book is filled with navaho folklore, and has an excellent use of description. It also has a lot of current cutting edge scientific knowledge about space exploration and research on possible martian exploration.     The reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that the ending seemed, well, forced. I kept thinking to myself, there are only X number of pages left, Bova better start wrapping up! When the end finally came, I felt like, \\"Okay, what just happened?\\" and \\"There's no more?\\"    If you like good, 'real world' sci-fi, stuff that could really happen today or sometime in the near future, read this book.	2004-10-21

Description is one of the most fundamental things a writer has to do, yet so many people who write do it poorly.<br />Monica Wood takes the idea of description, and makes it an easy to use 'technique' in your writing. This is a necessary guide for all of us who like to write. The idea of show, don't tell, is pushed here, but not to the point of being obnoxious. Wood shows how to use all of the senses in your descriptions to make your reader feel as though he/she were there. That's key. 'A big, red house..' isn't description. ...a house the color of dried blood, with a roofline so tall that the clouds seemed to have to part to get around the peak..' now that's description!<br />I have a few reference, or technique books on my shelf, and this one is one that I open most often. I want to make sure my readers understand where they are and what they're seeing, smelling, and feeling in the story. This book teaches the reader how to do just that.	2003-07-25

This is the best book so far in the Harry Potter series. This book delves more into the characters' emotions, as well as their histories. I can't say much more than others have said, so I won't even try.<br />This book introduces a score of new characters that are members of 'the order of the phoenix'. I'll let you read the book to find out who they are and what they're doing, but I will say this, these are some of the most colorful characters Rowling has come up with yet. It also has an even darker tone to it, which seems to be increasing with each passing volume. I will say this about the book, it has one of the best climactic scenes of any book I've ever read - a battle that takes place between the forces of good and evil.<br />I can see myself reading this book several times, just to try and catch all the things I might have missed the first go round. I read it so quickly the first time, I just wanted to know how it ended! I would suggest reading it at a leisurely pace instead of the frantic pace I had.<br />This book makes me eagerly anticipate the 6th book in the series when it will be released in a couple of years most likely. As a writer, I have to tip my proverbial hat to JK Rowling for her work, although I did find a half dozen or so grammatical errors in the book. In an 800 page book, I think that's pretty good!	2003-07-25

This guide came very highly recommended, and I can see why. It is very easy to follow, and is filled with lots of information I (and my wife) didn't know. The author comes across in a very straightforward way that is not militant about breastfeeding, as some authors are. &quot;If you don't breastfeed, you're guilty of child-abuse,&quot; some books say. Come on!<br />One of the particularly useful sections of the book was the section on breastpumps. Many books on the market have outdated lists with obsolete models.<br />If you're interested in breastfeeding your child, and want a book that explains things in an easy to understand way, this is the one for you.	2003-07-21

In other words, I'm trying to be objective.<br />This book would be a valuable resource for me if I were a non-fiction writer. The sections on non-fiction book and article proposals took up most of the book, with the section on the novel proposals, query letters and synopses taking up about a quarter of the book.<br />On a positive note, the book does include good examples of things writers shouldn't do when writing and submitting these documents. Many books on the subject describe your formats, but don't show you an example of a well-written document.<br />One thing I noticed immediately upon opening the book, was the large typeface. I liked this, as it made the book easier to look at. I've read entirely too many books with miniscule typefaces, only to come away with a headache from squinting at it once I'm done reading. I liked this, but then, the large typeface also made the book longer and made it look as though it contained more material than it actually did.<br />I couldn't give it 5 stars for reasons mentioned by other reviewers, but if you are a non-fiction writer or a fiction writer in need of additional references, this is a good book.	2003-05-21

This is probably the best guide to document formatting I've seen yet. Of course, half the staff at Writers Digest magazine wrote it! Most of them are writers or editors as well, so it only makes sense that it would be good.<br />I looked at several different formatting books in my search for the best. Many of them got great reviews when they were released. The problem is, most of them are more than 5 years old. With the publishing business changing as rapidly as anything else these days, you need an updated resource to follow, especially if you are new to the business of writing - and yes, it is a business. In business, things are expected to be done a certain way, and this book shows you that way.<br />This book is chock full of full page examples of everything from proposals, cover letters, tables of contents, etc. It's broken down into sections like most of the other books, each one covering a topic such as articles, novels, and screenplays.<br />If you want a book that is easy to follow when formatting your manuscript and writing the associated correspondence to an editor/publisher/agent, this is the book for you. The example documents even show you how many spaces to leave between lines etc. I don't think they could have made it any easier if they had sent someone to my house and had them walk me through the formatting!<br />One thing I thought disappointing was mentioned by another reviewer. Personal essays is mentioned on the cover, but after a quick search, I wasn't able to find that topic covered at all in the book, even in the index. My guess is that it's assumed that these documents would be handled according to guidelines from a different section, although which section eludes me.<br />Overall, this is the best book out there. It's new, and covers the currently accepted formats for a plethora of documentation. If you're searching for a book like this, spend the money, it's well worth it.	2003-05-21

As a Biochemist, I enjoyed reading about the 'cutting-edge' laboratory technology that Crichton wrote about when writing this book in the early 1970's. Most of the laboratory equipment is commonplace nowadays, but still quite useful.<br />The story takes place inside a fictional underground military installation in the Nevada desert. The base has one purpose, to contain, evaluate, and eliminate infectious agents that might be brought back from outer space.<br />The Scoop 7 satellite has brought back something so deadly, that within seconds of breathing it in, the victim is dead. The team must evaluate the infectious agent and determine how to protect us from it. The story has a good flow, and lots of edge-of-your-seat action.<br />In addition to this story, I recommend Sphere, Jurassic Park, Eaters of the Dead, and Congo.	2002-11-27

The attempted to make it more pleasing to a wider audience, and in turn changed one of the major characters in the book, but changing her from the driven corporate ladder climber (book version), to a former CIA agent. The CIA agent thing, got really annoying really fast in the movie. They should have left her alone, it was much more believable.<br />Anyway, back to the book. The book follows a team of explorers looking for blue Herkimer (sp) diamonds needed for their companies communications systems. They inadvertently discover a lost city that has been reclaimed by the jungle, before being brutally killed.  The company sends a second team in to find out what happened to the first team, and to secure the diamonds.<br />The team ultimately discovers that the cities former inhabitants used trained gorillas to protect the diamond mines from theft. As it turns out, the gorillas went psycho and wiped out the city, and there descendants are still protecting the mines, two thousand years later.<br />Pick this one up if you can.
