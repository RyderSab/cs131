(thanx for the recommendation, mrs solomon).  since then, evry few years i have come back to it and with each re-reading find it a richer experience.  miller's splendid storytelling weaves three related and distinct tales, each separated by six centuries, yet each linked by the commonality of the search for truth.<br />i suppose the first section, laying out the tale of brother francis gerard of utah, is the most celebrated in that as in all trilogies, the first section is the one that most easily stands alone; but the two later sections are equally wonderful in portraying the battle among blind faith, informed faith, technological wisdom, and naivete -- all finally adding up to something akin to truth.<br />and now to read the sequel, which has been sitting on my bookshelf for the past several months.<br />if this WAS miller's only book, his is once again proof of the value of quality over quantity.	2001-06-24
