What a mistake. Now that I think about it, I find it odd that nearly all of the glowing reviews of this book are from \\"readers\\" who only have one review to their name. It leads me to wonder if many of the reviews here are being written by the same person. <br /> <br />\\"Flesh and the Devil\\" showed a lot of promise at the beginning but the story starts to fall apart almost immediately. Kola Boof had a very good idea with this novel of two Afrians whose love trancends many generations but she just doesn't have the talent to properly execute the idea into a coherent enjoyable story. To be perfectly honest, by the time the story got to modern day America, I had completely lost interest. The characters are one dimensional and the plot is just plain silly. The longer it goes on the more unreadable it becomes. <br />	2004-11-20

Danticat is truly a gifted writer. The story, told by an orphaned Haitian servant is as lyrical as it is tragic and is definitely worth picking up.	2003-07-16

Books	3	26	31	N	N	Worth a Look	This book is a frank &amp; funny discussion on how race is lived from decidedly hip-hop perspective. It is a collection of lists, cartoons and essays published to skewer ALMOST every color of the rainbow. For the most part, it does a pretty good job.<br />The section devoted to sports was definitely the most thought provoking and informative, while the rest of the book was pretty hit (&quot;Fear of a Black Pool Party&quot; &amp; the dictionary of new coined ethnic slurs) OR miss (the majority of the section on Asians was pretty weakly written, sorry y'all.)<br />I think the book could have been improved if the female perspective wasn't limited to one short piece on hair. For all the talk about what's wrong with everybody, women writers are almost completely left out. Except for a few scattered lists of women the writers found attractive (Brooke 'Doll Parts' Burke? Oh please!), this pop culture reference book doesn't have much to offer the ladies.<br />All in all I think the book is worth a look, it's far from perfect but still pretty entertaining.	2002-10-24

This thin volume contains essays from young women of all walks of life: from a bisexual homegirl in Portland trying to keep it together to a biracial girl in lily white Vermont coming to terms with who she is, the reader of SUGAR will share in all the girl's excitement, fears and triumphs. <br />The only drawback is the the book is so short. The editor interviewed over 90 girls from around the country but only 15 are included here. SUGAR can be easily read in one sitting and will leave you wanting more. Hopefully, a SUGAR II is in the works.<br />All in all, this book would make a great gift for a young woman of any race.	2000-10-30

Her collection of poetry titled BORN PALESTINIAN BORN BLACK is both a refreshing and intelligent voice from a seldom heard Palestinian American minority.  Unfortunately, as a memoirist, she still has a long way to go to develop an ear for good and engaging prose. DROPS IN THIS STORY is not only a painfully thin volume but it also lacks cohesion and depth. Suheir's publisher would have done her a favor by handing her back this manuscript and telling her to come back in ten years when she had something better to say.<br />Hammad routinely ripples the water on the surface many subjects that beg for deeper analysis. From sexism and bigotry to her parent's ill fated attempt at finding her a suitor. From her father's alcoholism to cutting her long virginal hair to simply being-an-American-while-looking-like-a-Puerto-Rican-and-not speaking-a-lick-of-Arabic. Instead of delving into these funny and painful experiences in her coming of age story , Hammad sticks them to the pages of her memoir like post-it notes, reminding the reader of events that don't connect. <br />What the reader is left with is scattered pages from some one else's diary that never quite bridges the gap into becoming a real memoir. <br />Hammad routinely talks about her DROPS--this constant &quot;wetness&quot; that begs her to write, demands that she write...but the story as it was published isn't memorable. One reflection in DROPS recants the story of a waiter asking Suhier what she does:<br />&quot;I'm a writer,&quot; she says <br />&quot;What do you write about?&quot; he asks. <br />&quot;Myself,&quot; she answers to which he retorts, <br />&quot;How boring.&quot; <br />'Tis	2000-10-30

I've read and purchased almost every book available on the topic of natural hair, from Tulani Kinard's &quot;NO LYE&quot; to &quot;LET'S TALK HAIR&quot; and &quot;FOR COLORED GIRLS...&quot; I was always intrigued by this book by Nekhena Evans but was put off by some of the negative reviews it received. Well let me tell you that those reviews are pretty accurate! I finally got to see a copy of the book at my locktician's salon and let me tell you ladies, it is simply not worth the price if you are looking for information on how to lock your hair! A more accurate title for this book would have been: COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT LOCKED HAIR, because that's all it is. Each chapter refutes myths about locked hair and the people who wear them. It contains very few pictures and the ones it does contain are small, grainy and black &amp; white. It poses questions such as &quot;Do people with locks wash their hair?&quot;; &quot;Should I use wax to help form my locks&quot;; &quot;Is hair essentially dead matter?&quot;, and more of the same info that most of us already know. If you are a person that has researched the style and want useful information on the pros and cons of different methods for forming locks, styling exisiting locks, proper care &amp; maintenance, photos of locked styles, correcting problems with developing locks, coloring locks, etc...you WILL NOT FIND THE ANSWERS HERE!!! This book is very short and can be read in less than a half hour. Some of the information is quasi-spiritual and shady on the facts. Honestly, I expected much more from the author since she has been a locktician for so long.	2000-10-24

Zimmer reveals that these often maligned &amp;  misunderstood beings are actually highly evolved and complex creatures  capable, in some instances, of controlling the sex lives and/or behavior of  thier hosts. Apparently, every living (or once living) thing on the planet  is full of 'em, so you might as well pick up PARASITE REX and learn what  interesting things they can do. Some of the bios in this book may creep you  out but you'll never look at yourself (or anything around you) the same way  again. Zimmer does an excellent job explaining the ins and outs of the  parasite lifestyle in a readable and enjoyable way. Recommended!	2000-09-08

NO LYE! is probably my favorite book on the topic of natural haircare for  Black women. Although I've owned it for several years, I still find myself  pulling it off the bookshelf when I'm contemplating a new style.<br />Tulani  takes a decidedly &quot;Afrocentric&quot; approach to hair styling so you  won't find any braid styles that &quot;mimic&quot; European hair (for  example, there are no weaves or individual braids w/ human hair ends left  free flowing).<br />NO LYE! is full of useful information about the various  &quot;types&quot; of African hair and how to best care for it in it's  natural state. It also contains information on hair adornment, proper diet,  caring for children's hair, alopecia and dryness/breakage.<br />The book is  full of beautiful black and white pictures of sisters (with and without  extensions) sporting braids, naturals and locked styles. Since I'm  considering locking my own hair, I found the info in the lock chapter to be  inspiring and extremely helpful.<br />NO LYE is a fantastic all-around  reference book for natural hair but many of the styles would probably have  to be done by a professional stylist if you aren't an expert braider  yourself (I'm not). There is a brief segment on how to braid with  extensions but it wasn't detailed enough for me to copy. Aside from twists  and short naturals, there aren't many do-it-yourself styles for natural  sisters in the book. <br />In any case, I would recommend this book to anyone  that has recently made the committment to natural hair.	2000-09-06

As much as my body look like it ain't never  supposed to be loved by no boy.'' --Tasha, IMANI ALL MINE<br />IMANI ALL MINE  is a beautifully written story about a smart 15 year old girl that refuses  to be anyone's stereotype of a young unwed mother. <br />All too often society  is quick to disregard or deem as unimportant the suffering and yearning of  poor African-American teenage mothers. People may try to paint Tasha as a  victim but she trancends the lable, refusing to apply it to herself as she  carves out a life for herself and her young daughter in her tough inner  city neighborhood.<br />Tasha's life isn't one that you'll see portrayed on  Dawson's Creek, she lives a seperate reality where there are no cotillions  or first dates. Porter has an excellent ear for urban dialogue and infuses  Imani with a compassionate spirit that speaks to the heart of the reader.  IMANI ALL MINE is a touching story that I would highly recommend to anyone.	2000-09-05

With the exception of Octavia Butler and  a few other talented writers, people of African decent don't seem to play  much of a role in the future as defined by writers of fantasy/speculative  fiction. For that reason, I was intrigued when I read the description for  A.D. on Amazon and ordered the book.<br />Although the premise is interesting  (an African American man is cryogenically frozen and awakes 400 years later  in a racially segregated New World Order) the author, Saab Lofton, lacks  the imagination and talent as a writer to make the novel work.<br />The reader  is immediately challeged to suspend their disbelief to the point that  he/she will believe that bankrupt Aryan leader Tom Metzger and NOI despot  Louis Farrakhan are smart/influencial enough to split up the country  according to their racist doctrines. <br />Sounds far fetched? It is. By tying  the events in his novel to these pathetic figures, Lofton not only makes  his futurist novel seem &quot;dated&quot; but wholly implausible. He simply  lacks the talent to create a future existence that can borrow from the  present and exapand it without creating a heavy-handed and choppy  diatribe.<br />The novel's protagonist, Elijah, rarely rises above Lofton's  thumbnail sketch of him. Other characters suffer the same fate. In a story  as fantastic as this one it is imperative that the characters be fleshed  out enough to make the story believable. Lofton simply never accomplishes  this. <br />Lofton (a far left socialist) can't decide if A.D. is really a  novel or a flimsy article for the pages of the Socialist Worker. Never  content to let the characters and their actions speak for themselves,  Lofton continually stiffles the story by interjecting (read:forcefeeding)  the reader his own political agenda. <br />His writing style is overly  didactic, never allowing the reader to become absorbed in the  &quot;story&quot; itself. In addition to this flaw, the editing of the  novel is so bad it's a distraction. Fragmented sentences and other  grammatical errors make A.D. a test of the reader's patience.<br />Aside from  these problems the novel itself isn't very original. Lofton heavily borrows  storylines from Ayn Rand and George Orwell without taking note of their ear  for dialogue and passion for storytelling. Where Orwell builds suspense in  1984, Lofton is predictable.<br />In the end, A.D. is a forgettable story.  I've read reviews in leftist papers that praised the novel for challenging  reader perspectives when in all honesty people are more challenged by  well-written, thought provocing pieces. This is not that piece and fans of  A.D. are probably already in the choir that Lofton is preaching to.<br />If  you must read this book, I implore you to skip the self-congratulatory  introduction . In it Lofton goes on his own diatribe against  &quot;Trekkies&quot; and whines endlessly about being homeless (though he  never slept in a shelter); not being able to handle school at a local  community college and full time work (note to Saab: people do it all the  time); and waiting for his &quot;inheritance&quot; to kick it. To make  things even worse, he refers to himself as &quot;The Mighty Saab Lofton,  King of the Impossible&quot;--I wish I were kidding. The prologue isn't  much better (a mini-PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE US without the footnotes) and  is out of place in a book that is supposedley a sci-fi novel.	2000-09-05

From the ditzy model to the career girl  writer to the hopeless social climber, Bushnell's attepts at satire and  humor are weak and dated. <br />Don't get me wrong, I love clothes and shoes  and vacations as much as the next girl but somehow the pursuits of these  women come across as so superficial or mind-numbingly uninteresting that I  didn't care one way or the other about the outcome. <br />I'm an African  American woman so I don't need to identify with these women but I would  like to be ENTERTAINED!

Campbell has an excellent ability  to traverse modern day racial complexities in a manner which is neither  unrealistic nor condescending. Any Black female professional is bound to  identify with the struggles and situations that Ester faces in the book:  trust issues with White co-workers, dating a blue-collar man, walking the  colorline, and maintaining personal dignity in a workspace where nobody  looks like you.

Gayl Jones masterfully tells the story of how one Black woman's  life was manipulated and changed forever because of the sexual abuse she  encountered at every stage of her development and how this brutality  eventually led to a bizaare murder. <br />This was a hard read both  emotionally and physically. Jones takes liberties with time and detail  jumping back and forth in the story and slowly giving the reader the  complete picture of Eva's life. I had to read and re-read chapters for fear  of missing crucial detail. <br />What the reader is left with is a glimpse  into the mind of a fractured woman unable to love for fear of being  victimized. What Eva chooses to do instead is assume the role of the  victimizer and take extreme control of her own sexuality by killing her  lover.<br />Within the pages of this horror story, Jones mananges to give Eva  a language and image that is brutal, honest, sadistic and frail. If ever  there was a complicated anti-hero in modern fiction, here she is. <br />I  didn't come away from the novel with praise or pity for Eva, but her story  is one that has stayed in my mind months after finishing the book.	2000-08-21

Everyone from Bobby Seale and Ike Turner to Lori B.  Andrews and David Horowitz are victimized by her poision pen as she tries  to get the last word on aged disagreements.<br />Brown is refreshingly honest  about her own failed parenting, drug abuse and promiscuity but still comes  across as suspiciously noble in the face of all the temptations and  double-dealing that plagued the party in it's later years.<br />That being  said, TASTE OF POWER is a well-written and engaging memoir that will reveal  to the reader the need for modern Black women to form their own grassroots  organizations for social/political change in the US.	2000-08-21

As a  reader, one wants Dee Dee to be fulfilled, get the last word, and fall in  love (even when she's acting slightly immature or  unreasonable.)<br />Unfortunately, for a novel of this  length, Sinclair  doesn't really do a good job of tying all the ends together. <br />Most of her  characters are intriguing but they never rise beyond the thumbnail sketches  that Sinclair makes of them. With all the drama going on in the book  (coming out, divorce, single-parenting, sexual harassment, incest, and  problems in the Black community) Sinclair isn't mindfull enough to fully  flesh out the dilemas and bring a satisfactory level of closure to the can  of worms she's opened.<br />The most interesting exchanges in the novel take  place at Dee Dee's work where we encounter her Chinese friend and  co-worker, an older African American security guard who has  &quot;quit&quot; being Black, a White male co-worker on the verge of a  breakdown, and random callers to her radio show. <br />In her work setting,  Dee Dee is at her best. Unfortunately, once her relationship with a new man  takes off, her other relationships seems to struggle for lip service as  once important characters pop in and out, serving no real purpose.<br />This  isn't the best book I've read this year but it is an entertaining  quick-read. I'd put April Sinclair is the mid-range of modern African  American female writers. It's very easy to visualize a book like this one  being made into a Alfre Woodard movie.	2000-08-15

I desperately wanted to know the how's/why's of her life in  those missing twenty years.<br />Walker is clearly more obsessed with New Age  spirituality than good old fashioned story-telling. Hers is the genre of  empowerment and while many readers respond positively to this, it doesn't  move me personally.	2000-08-11

Ian McEwan did a fantastic job of of creating completely self-absorbed  unsympathetic characters in a setting that is more bland that English  cuisine. <br />I found myself wishing that the opening scene was the funeral  for ALL of the main characters and not just that dearly departed  manipulator Molly Lane. It's just that awful!<br />A friend of mine tells me  that McEwan is really truly talented (in spite of AMSTERDAM) and that the  Booker Prize is always awarded one book late. Maybe if I'm feeling brave  I'll buy ENDURING LOVE but don't count on it anytime soon!	2000-08-09

While I wouldn't exactly compare this collection of stories to THE BEST AMERICAN EROTICA or DESIRES, BLUE LIGHT does contain some very good sensual  writing that encompass the diversity of Black sensuality without  heavy-handed vulgarity.<br />I found many of the passages here to be more  heartwarming than flesh sizzling. A person that is curious about sensual  fiction but uncomfortable with the idea of reading &quot;dirty  stories&quot; will really appreciate this volume.<br />Robotham did an  excellent job selecting stories about young and mature love, passion, and  obsession. I found the book to be funny, sexy, and enlightening and look  forward to more volumes to come.<br />Many of the stories are reprints from  novels or other previously published works but, far from detracting from  it's value, it may introduce the reader to some fabulous female authors.  Alice Walker and Edwige Danticat are standouts. Enjoy!	2000-08-09

I can't say much about this book without parroting word-for-word the  glowing reviews of other readers on this page. <br />What I can tell you is  that I found this narrative of the lives of a family of missionaries in pre  &amp; post independance Congo/Zaire fasincating and masterfully written.  <br />The story was so engaging that I finished the mammoth book in two days.  Although it is a work of fiction, Kingsolver sets it firmly against the  real life history and culture of the Congo that left me wanted more. <br />I  think that for the first time I got a emotional understanding of the the  devastation that Africa has endured by the hands of her greedy suitors. I  was embarrassed by my lack of knowledge on the region and the level of  involvment of the USA and Western Europe in the bloodshed. <br />After I  finished the book I quickly snapped up KING LEOPOLD'S GHOST and AFRICA:  BIOGRAPHY OF A CONTINENT and I'm still reading!<br />I highly recommend this  book and although I realize this a departure from Kingsolver's usual genre,  I look forward to reading more of her heartfelt prose.	2000-08-08

I hate to say it, since Mr. Tyree seems to have so many fans, but FLYY GIRL is the worst book I've read in the last few years.<br />This humorless  and overtly sexual &quot;novel&quot; basically tells the story of a young  chickenhead's (Tracy) coming of age in wasteland of several hundred  pages.<br />The novel reads like a 10th grade creative writing assignment gone  haywire and in the end the reader is left with a 400+ novel that could have  been told in 20 double spaced pages effortlessly. The somewhat promising  premise about the journey to self-respect is lost in the long winded and  often muddled dialogue of the book. <br />Tyree wastes pages of painfully  simple dialogue on subplots and scenes that go nowhere. This book lacks the  natural flow of urban language that other writers (namely Morrison,  Hurston, McMillian, George) do so well. <br />His character development isn't  much better since the characters are all one dimensional and don't seem to  stray far from the one sentence notes about them that Tyree MUST have  scribbled down the day he wrote this one.<br />Tyree lacks the finesse to  build an atmosphere for his scenes and it's obvious that he has no clue as  to how to give the reader a mental picture of someone without going into  overdrive about their physical appearance. Almost every character is  haphazardly introduced with a description of height, hair texture and skin  color.<br />The main character is, in a word, STUPID. How someone as shallow  as she was can go from chickenhead to Afrocentric queen in a few short  chapters is beyond reason. The lack of consequence for the life of  promiscuity Tracey leads is irresponsible and unrealistic. <br />The majority  of the book takes place during Tracey's 14th year of life. Those chapters  drag on for so long that I felt as if I were living everyday with her  (think dayplanner, not diary.) Other flat characters in the book also seem  to reach their own epiphanies just in time to move the story along.<br />Male  characters get the roughest treatment in FLYY GIRL since Tyree seems to  equate black teenage masculinity with would be rapist/pariahs with no depth  of emotion of feelings aside from the basest impulses.<br />I bought this book  thinking it might be a nice beach read and had to struggle to finish it for  lack of interest. I'm embarrassed to even have this on my bookshelf.	2000-08-06

McMillian, etc) in the past few years has had the positive effect of proving to publishing houses that fiction centered around the lives African-American women sells. Unfortunately, this book doesn't live up to those standards. The story is wholly uninteresting and mosty unplausible. The central characters in this book read like the credits on a soap opera: Spice, Sterling, Golden and Mink? Give me a break! The characters in this book were completely one dimensional and unrealistic and given that they are all African American it made zero sense that the topic of ethnicity (especially in the South) never came up in a realistic fashion. There is nothing in the book that allows the reader to connect with anyone in the book on more than a superficial level. It's as if the author took notes from her favorite soap operas and colored the characters black. Not for the more discerning reader of African American fiction. I'm all for escapist summer reading but many other writers just seem to do this McMillian one better...	2000-07-19

Like some of the other readers, I was disappointed by the virtual absence of strong female characters in this Patternist story. I've read all four books in the series and found this one to be the least gratifying. With all  due respect to Ms. Butler, whom I admire greatly, this book lacked the  imagination of the prior installments and the central characters seems much  less &quot;human&quot; in that they come across as one-dimensional and  single-issue driven without much personality. At times the reading was  frustrating and void of any recognizable emotion. I found no real chemistry  between any of the characters since they all were completely at the mercy  of the Patternmaster. Also, unlike most of Butler's other books, none of  the characters (with the exception of the healer) are identified by race.  Race and social conditions play no role in this universe that Butler has  created which may be fine for some readers but those preferring more  realism may not enjoy this effort. I would highly recommend the other books  in the series: Wild Seed, Mind of My Mind, and Clay's Ark for traditional  or new Octavia Butler fans.	2000-07-18

I've read reviews of this series that have criticized Ms. Butler for having such a bleak view of the future and I agree that her vision for the next 50 years isn't easy to swallow. She tends to focus her work more on  societal deterioration and not so much on technological advances like so  many other sci-fi writers. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy novels like Neal  Stephenson's &quot;Diamond Age&quot; but it didn't encourage me to run out  and get a Computer Science M.A., reading this book by Ocativia Butler made  me think about my community and scrutinize the things I wasn't doing to  improve it. Yes, at times &quot;Parable&quot; is hard to read, but it has a  big enough dose of reality to serve as a much needed wake-up call to  humanity. There is definitely more to life than IPOs and open source  software! As a Black woman I also enjoyed that Butler is the ONLY sci-fi  writer I've read that knows the meaning of the word DIVERSITY. The main  characters in her books are always Black women but they don't live in an  all-Black world. Butler is always careful to include characters of all hues  and nationalities. I can't recommend this book enough. Go for it!	2000-05-02

The personal narratives and excellent photography make this book the perfect gift for any young African American. It is truly inspiring to read the words of the next generation and learn how they are coping with success  in spite of the racism and negativity that is so prevalent in the 21st  century. It is a perfect companion to AS I AM. The only draw back is that  Mr. Okwu didn't provide contact information for these talented, handsome  young men.M-E-O-W!	2000-01-05

The book is about 260 pages long but there aren't any photos of natural hairstyles until page 185! The first 2/3 of the book is a manual for  cosmetologists on how to care for a clients natural hair. Since I have most  of the other popular books on natural haircare (Pam Ferrel, Tulani Kinard,  Bonner, etc) I already know most of this information. Except for a special  8 page section at the end of the book, all the photos are in black and  white. This is fine but some of the photos are instructional and it's very  difficult to see how the styles are made. The section on locks styles (palm  rolling, etc) is very very short and not very good. For example there is  only one small photo that shows how to palm roll and since it's not in  color you can't see it. This is the biggest problem with the book. The  short chapter on flat twists is a failure. The photos are lovely but there  is not photo instruction and the author tries to explain how to achieve the  style in 3 sentences. That's it. If you are a person that frequently buys  black hairstyling magazines, I guarantee that you've seen ALL of the photos  in this book. They are used frequently in hairstyle magazines. If you are  beautician who isn't familiar with natural african hair, you will find this  book useful but for women with natural hair who are looking for new styles,  I would buy LETS TALK HAIR instead.	1999-12-04

On the one hand, she writes remarkable well about the human condition and even her shortest stories translate into volumes in the mind. On the other hand Ms. West's constant  references to skin color and class are contrived and nauseating. It make on  e think that maybe she hated her own warm brown skin. These stories are  interesting. Some are underdeveloped mostly because she was so very young  when she penned them. It's a worthwhile book but it didn't make me a fan.	1999-06-10

The author does a fantastic job of  observation into the life of a &quot;typical&quot; Japanese housewife. The  book gave me a deeper understanding of one aspect of Asian culture that I  couldn't have learned otherwise. At times, the reading lags a bit because  of its ordinary-ness but at the same time it is the ordinary day to day  struggles that Mariko encounters that makes the work so engaging. I  recommend it highly to anyone that is willing to spend a day reflecting on  something other than themself.	1999-02-27

Perhaps you didn't know that because of the black woman some black men: can't hold jobs; be good husbands and fathers; date/marry outside the race; are  criminals; etc. This woman takes pride in being an idiot.

Sisterlocks are a beautiful way for black women to style their hair but this book contained almost no information on how to do  it. Ms. Cornwell has trademarked the system so you have to have one of her  people do it...if you can find one (none live in my area) This make the  book seem like a rather expensive piece of ad copy. There are no color  photos or how-to's on caring for locks. The photos contained in the book  are nice but there are'nt many of them and most of the pages are filled  with essay type writing on Cornwall's own hair history. There are other  books on locks and hair care that are probably more useful. Try &quot;No  Lye!&quot; by Tulani Kinard. It is much more informative and includes just  as much info  on the SisterLock system and hair care for locks (it's also  cheaper!)	1999-02-03

As an African-American woman it was a relief to finally find a futuristic novel than had black people actively taking part in the future. Butler's vision of the years to come are both  terrifying and wholly believable yet she manages to instill a sense of  hope.  I checked this novel out from the library and read it in two days.  When I had finished I went to the nearest bookstore to purchase it for my  own library. I cannot recommend this (or all of her other fiction) enough.	1999-01-14

Unlike the color-struck works of Dorothy West this Harlem Renaissance author brings all of the pain of duality of multi-cultural  people to the reader. Helga Crane lives between the two worlds of white and  black and expresses the same anguish that many middle class blacks feel  today. She is not the &quot;tragic mulatto&quot;  as many critic paint her.  This book should be read by anyone with an interest in the politics of  race.	1998-12-14
