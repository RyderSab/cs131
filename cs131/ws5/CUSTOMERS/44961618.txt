This book is very engaging, nicely written and gives such a sweeping panorama of British naval history that one wonders how the author was able to command the sources necessary to produce this volume.  I am usually not a fan of naval history, esp. in the 18th & 19th centuries, but this was a fun read.<br /><br />However, I do see one overall issue here that may in fact be the book's chief and fatal flaw: Herman seems to try to boil down everything related to the British navy from Elizabethan times to the 1980s in terms of personalities.  That is to say, he focuses far too heavily on contingency and men's actions and not enough on grand scale historical processes, structures and buracracies.  I'm usually a big fan of contingency in history, the belief that history is changed and influenced to a large degree by the actions of human beings.  Fred Anderson's CRUCIBLE OF WAR and David H. Fischer's WASHINGTON'S CROSSING are excellent examples of such interpretations. But Herman goes beyond these 2 books, and stresses it so much that it becomes very simplistic.  He does this to the extent that logistics, British politics, international relations, economics, financial history, etc. are all downplayed/ignored.  At one point (p. 349) he boils down the Napoleonic Wars to a duel between 2 men-Napoleon & Nelson. He writes \\"two men, and two only, would decide the final outcome [of the war]: the masters of the two new kinds of warfare, Napoleon and Nelson. the events of the next decade were as much a matter of a personal duel between them as a conflict between competing nations and political ideologies.\\" Quite frankly, this is absurd and extremely simplistic and sullies an otherwise good book.	2005-07-29

It should merit 3 stars alone just to have Prof. Waldstreicher actually come out with a book that people can read!  His other works have been dreadfully written (esp. his work in Journal of the Early republic), the worst prose in the business. However, not only is this book very nicely written, for which he deserves commendation, but its also interesting.  What Waldstreicher does is demostrate how labor inthe 1st half of the 18th century in America was quite often \\"unfree\\": either due to slavery, indentured servitude or an apprenticeship.  Waldstreicher's contribution here si to show how BF's life was marked by all three. He was an apprentice himself, kept Indentured servants and owned a slave or two.  It is a great way to explore this issue of labor and freedom in the colonies, and to do so by using the life of a Founding Father.<br /><br />Given the subject and the prose, I have no reservations at all about rating this book 5 stars.	2005-07-22

I will only use one example: he writes that G. Washington was a brigadier general during the Fr. & Ind. War. That is totally wrong. GW was never able to secure so much as a captaincy in the British Army, so the classification of him as a brigadier general during the 1758 Forbes campaign is just bunk.  Forbes was not the commander in chief so he could not award commissions in the regular army, all of which had to be approved by the King eventually. On the basis of his commission as Colonel in the Virginia Regiment, Washington could serve at that rank in charge of a collection of provincial regiments which could be referred to as a brigade, but he would not carry any rank in the regular army and he would not command regular troops.	2005-07-22

A WILDERNESS OF MISERIES and A LEAP IN THE DARK. However, this book is not his finest and that is surprising considering that this is in Oxford Univ Press's PIVOTAL MOMMENTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY series.  Overall, having finished it, it is what I'd call light weight.  In some parts it is breezy, and lacking depth.  His handling of Burr (as far as motive, biographical background, etc) is seriously lacking, to the point that the reader really doesn't know the man at all.  There's no explantion about why he decided in 1800 to try to snatch the presidency away from TJ, or any of his actions for that matter.  This mishandling of Burr in the book is curious given that Ferling is known for his competent biographies--esp. Adams.  Also, Ferling would have us belive that TJ was not only the author of the Dec of Indep (true), but that the ideas therein were his as well (false).  In this he completely ignores recent scholarship which demostartes that very little in the Dec of I were original to TJ.<br /><br />I'd recommend reading the appropriate chapters in Elkins and McKittrick on the election of 1800, rather than Ferling's book.	2005-06-30

Eurocentricity-especially in western Europe and the USA.<br /><br />2. Technology bias in explaining military cabability and fascination with technology.<br /><br />3. A focus on leading powers and dominant military systems.<br /><br />4. A separation of land from sea conflict in most analysis.<br /><br />5. A focus on state to state conflict rather that use of force within states (except for major civil wars).<br /><br />6. A lack of focus on political tasking in the setting of force structures, doctrines and goals, and in judging military success.<br /><br />He also identifies several trends, noting that the emphasis on technology is too great; there has been a primitivization of non-western combatants, and that military history has a very battle centered approach. Black calls for lowering barriers between history and social sciences work on war and violence.  Why? There has been too much emphasis on operational accounts.<br /><br />Military history now is the \\"last stronghold of the Whig interpretation.\\"  He urges us to beware of any one \\"western way of war\\" (as does John Lynne), meta-narratives, paradigms and mono-causal explantations. He emphasizes diversity of military practice: there is no single western way of war...War is pluralistsic in its character.<br /><br />There has also been a trend to simplify the non-western military history.<br /><br />He also calls for a debate on how to explain military change: we can't just assume that it's a mechanisitic or an automatic search for efficiency to maximize force. Traditional military histories avoid using cultural approach, which is related to war and society.  With regard to assessing operational capabilities, Black says that care should be taken to avoid focusing too much on resources and technology, especially weapons systems and in the history of asymmetrical warfare.<br /><br />He also seems to reject Keegan's work to some degree, especially the \\"Face of battle approach\\": it shows a timeless quality of men facing combat which may not take into account that battle is much more culturally conditioned and varied.<br /><br />All of this is important to the current state of military history, and should be the subject of great debate. The problem is this: the vast majority of people who read military history (and thus buy the books on the shelves) want books about battles and leaders, especially with a dramatic, fast paced narrative OR they are military/defense professionals either in uniform or civilians, who want professional development/\\"lessons learned\\" type books.  The reading audience does not want cultural history overlays to their \\"trumpets and drums\\" books, nor do they want to see race, class and gender as the focus of this subject. Black covers this fairly well in the first chapter of the book.<br /><br />The problem with THIS book though is that Black's prose is truly dreadful.  An editor with some backbone should have turned it back to him and said \\"make it readable.\\"  The book is so poorly written, with severely awkward syntax, etc. that its impact will be limited because so few people will be able to tread the whole thing.ess quality of men facing combat which may not take into account that battle is much more culturally conditioned and varied. <br /> <br />All of this is important to the current state of military history, and should be the subject of great debate.

The description of academe today is depressing, though accurate--sad to say.  One problem with the book is that (intentional or not) the author outlines the misdeeds of Ambrose, Bellisles, Ellis, And Goodwin and by using a guilt by association method, he implies that all non-academic/popular historians are suspect as far as method, accuracy, credentials, etc.  The fact that Ambrose, Bellisles, Ellis, And Goodwin are/were ACADEMIC historians and university trained is a telling one: he offers no evidence of popular, non-academic historians plagarising and while the author hints that popular historians are only writing for celebrity reasons and telling people what they want to hear, he fails to offer the praise that David McCullough, Rick Atkinson, Jim McPherson, et al deserve for well-written books.	2004-11-16

Breen writes a nice book here with lots of detail on colonists as consumers, and how the so-called market revolution impacted America prior to the Revolution.  He suggests that this mass consumerism was the bond that tied Americans together and was the reason they were able to unite and rebel in 1775.  My concern is that when he does expand upon the idea that this consumerism is what made colonists have something in common and allowed them to act in 1775 as a coordinated community, evidenceis lacking and Breen mostly speculates.

Many Indians were caught between two worlds-their own and that of the colonizers, who posed a threat to their survival.  The most obvious example of adaptation Lepore provides is the thousands of &quot;praying Indians&quot; who lived among the whites in several different towns, where they learned Christianity and the English language as well.  Indian James Printer, for example, James Printer, had set type for Bible printings in Massachusetts, and floated back and forth between worlds during the conflict itself.<br />  The persistence of Native Americans in New England is one of Lepore's major themes.  Indians suffered horrendous losses during the war (as did the colonists), followed by disease, which only compounded their miseries.  She notes that in the view of whites, King Philp (and by implication, all Indians) survive today only symbolically.  She notes that one can hike to King Phillip's Rock in Sharon, Massachusetts, attend King Phillip High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts, or lodge at the King Phillip Inn in Bristol, Rhode Island.  Whites today assume that New England's native peoples were eliminated soon after European colonization.  Such is not the case.  Lepore also argues that New England's natives were never a unified coalition, rather, they adapted to the arrival of whites by forging alliances with them in order to smite their traditional Indian enemies-in King Philip's War, several tribes fought with the colonists.	2004-03-13

In separate chapters, he details five major characteristics of American modernity in support of this claim: ethnic and national diversity; complex economies; \\"large-scale participatory politics\\"; religious pluralism; and \\"the modern penchant for power, control, and authority\\" over both their environment and other human beings.  This change from primitive 17th century outposts of Britain's colonial empire to \\"complex and variegated\\" (3) colonies by the mid 18th century is what Butler terms the \\"Revolution before 1776.\\"<br /> By 1770, America was anything but a homogeneous society in terms of its population, particularly when compared to Europe.  Butler notes that Indians and Europeans \\"lived side by side\\" (15) in most rural areas of the colonies.  Religious, economic and cultural strife forced many in Europe to immigrate to the British mainland colonies, while after 1680 the American colonies \\"became a haven for non-English Europeans.\\" (20)  Butler points to a variety of newcomers-Jews, Scots-Irish, French Huguenots, Germans and Swiss-who settled all over America to make the New World a mix of ethnic groups, which \\"predicted the growing importance of ethnicity in America\\" which continues to the present. (25)  Butler also details the \\"horrific suffering\\" of Africans, forced to America by the burgeoning slave trade at the end of the 17th century.  Writing sensitively about the plight of these enslaved blacks, he also notes that their influx \\"recast the seventeenth-century colonies and [became] the American future.\\" (36)<br /> Not only was America's population diverse, so was its religious composition.  \\"Colonial American religion,\\" Butler concludes, was \\"varied and rich between 1680s and the American Revolution.\\" (185) This \\"religious pluralism and vitality,\\" far more extensive than was characteristic of Europe, has been \\"identified as the very soul of modern American culture\\" he concludes.  Butler also points to ministers like George Whitefield as being modern, in their celebrity status, individualism and \\"nondenominational, media-conscious[ness].\\"<br /> Butler points to the diverse and complex economies of the British colonies in America as evidence of their modernity, though he is careful not to ignore the growing poverty and inequality in New World..  Colonists \\"took command\\" of their commercial life and shaped it into a \\"notably autonomous economy,\\" (51) especially in their agricultural pursuits, in which farming became more commercial after the 1680s.  This new emphasis on the market was accompanied by diversification.  Similarly, Butler shows that native Americans too \\"became enmeshed in complex and powerful economic relationships\\" with Europeans in the colonies. (67) Merchants won \\"wealth and status\\" through expansion, extension and specialization,\\" (69) all of which demonstrate for Butler that colonial economics were modern and complex.<br /> Colonial politics, Butler concludes, were \\"so complex that they often baffled observers.\\" (90)  Provincial politics, while not democratic, were popular and included that formation of \\"political groups that sometimes assumed almost modern, partylike appearances,\\" (96) such as the Quaker party which emerged in Pennsylvania in the 1740s. America after 1680 became less deferential and became a \\"more open, ultimately democratic nation.\\" (99)  Butler also points to the maturation of provincial assemblies after 1680 and the expansion of their power to demonstrate an increasing modernity of colonial politics.<br /> In Becoming America, Jon Butler has convincingly depicted British America from 1680 to 1770 as a place in which the colonies were becoming more modern, diverse and complex.  Yet some of his evidence does not point to modernity at all.  Although he vividly depicts the cultural and religious holocaust suffered by Africans upon their forced immigration to America, perhaps Butler should have made more out of the meaning of this labor system.  \\"American colonists made modern American slavery,\\" he writes, \\"they did not inherit it.\\" (42)  True enough; but they also slit noses, cut ankle cords, gelded and sold slaves far away from their kin.  Butler holds that slavery was a \\"distinctively modern institution,\\" (42) but readers may wonder if a society that sustains such barbarity through 1770 and beyond can truly be defined as modern.<br />This is a far better book than Jack Greene's misfire, Pursuits of Happiness.ted British America from 1680 to 1770 as a place in which the colonies were becoming more modern, diverse and complex.

US	44961618	RN2BZCC49I87C	0393951731	549679104	Revolutionary People at War	Books	5	18	23	N	N	Great read, well researched and presented	In A Revolutionary People at War: The Continental Army and American Character, historian Charles Royster searches for and analyzes the \\"American character prevalent during the War for Independence.\\" (vii)  Royster finds that with regard to the Continental Army specifically and the Revolutionary populace in general, \\"allegiance to the `American'...side in the War for Independence was the prevailing sentiment\\" in the United States, and that this allegiance was based primarily on what he terms \\"a national character.\\" (viii)  throughout the course of this book then, Royster chronicles the revolutionary character of America's soldiers, and how it changed markedly as the war progressed.  One of his central questions concerns the \\"ideals espoused during the revolution,\\" and how the patriots' actions measured up to them.  By 1783, Royster finds that the gap between ideals and reality was often significant.  Eight years of war, it seems, \\"severely tested American's dedication to independence.\\" (3)<br /> Royster uses a prologue to define his terms with a useful essay on the idea character.  The war would test Americans, especially those in their country's uniforms, and determine if they were worthy of victory.  Eventual victory would of course demonstrate that revolutionary soldiers had the necessary virtue and selflessness to be deserving of such good fortune.  Soldiers were keenly aware that the eyes of world were on them, and that their sacrifices would be remembered throughout the ages by countless generations of their descendents. Royster shows that Continental soldiers were inspired by religious beliefs, knowing that God was on their side.  These men also employed the language of slavery to describe their predicament-if they failed, they argued, Britain would not only enslave them, but their children as well.  Thus, these men in arms had a sacred duty: \\"the struggle for independence was the greatest test of the chosen people.  In it they bore the weight of both their heritage and God's promise for the future.\\" (9)<br /> In 1775, Americans began the war with high ideals in a period Royster denotes as the \\"Rage Militaire.\\"  The Continental army went about preparing to defend America in a uniquely American way, reflective of the national character.  Royster points to simplified drill manuals, short-term enlistments, soldiers in hunting shirts and civilian control of the military establishment as evidence that Americans would wage a war based upon their own terms, not simply by mimicking the British.  Yet by the end of 1776, the \\"contrasts between the ideals of 1775 and the conduct of the war\\" were apparent, in the form of battlefield defeats and Continental army's \\"lack of discipline and decorum.\\" (58)  Numerous desertions, for example, showed that not all American soldiers lived up to the ideals of patriotic sacrifice in the face of adversity.  In fact, \\"not only did the Continental Army fall short of Americans' ideal of an army,\\" Royster notes, but recruiting difficulties created \\"a network of evasion and corruption that spread far into the populace.\\" (63) He asserts as well that as the virtues of the soldiers were called into question after reverses, desertions, and abuses, many revolutionaries distanced themselves from the army, and denied that it embodied the cause of liberty exclusively.<br /> By early 1777, the army was not seen by Americans as virtuous.  Many civilians began to associate active military duty with a class of people-the young, unattached, \\"shiftless\\" types who were more logically suited to the ardors of Continental service.  This attitude greatly curtailed recruiting of army battalions to full strength.  High enlistment bounties designed to encourage men to join the ranks attest to the fact that the spirit of sacrifice so widespread in 1775 was much reduced by the beginning of the campaign of 1777, as did unscrupulous recruiting officers, uncooperative civilians and unruly men in the ranks.  Americans, Roysterfinds, were reluctant to rely upon a standing army to secure their liberties.  They wanted \\"the moral miracle of a quick victory that came from [the] virtuous ardor of a chose people.\\" (151)  Too often, however, the army's behavior both on and off the battlefield did not live up to the expectation of those to whom they were charged to defend.<br /> By the latter stages of the war, as Royster demonstrates, the differences between the ideals of virtue and common practice were in sharp contrast.  As evidence, he cites the \\"extensive trade with the enemy\\" (272) in some areas of the colonies; excessive profiteering by suppliers of war materiel; graft among officers and men; and \\"the widespread failure to enlist.\\" (276)  Royster is clear to point out that these actions did not signify a weakening of desire for victory and independence, but a weariness and desperation instead.  The bitter, internecine fighting in the Carolinas and the lower Hudson Valley demonstrated not a slackening desire for independence, but how far patriots had drifted from the ideals of the early days of the struggle.<br /> What Royster finds in the end is that despite the inability of most Americans in and out of uniform to live up to the virtuous ideals of 1775, by the end of the war it matter little.  Americans remembered the war as they wanted to, one in which men fought for liberty and won through sacrifice and honorable means.  \\"The popular interpretation of victory in the Revolutionary War,\\" he finds, \\"restored the citizens to their original and vital stature as the pillars of America's future glory.\\" (360) While some readers may find his assertion that \\"the founding generation had left the country's strength, virtue and liberty intact\\" (366) a bit hyperbolic and subject to alternative interpretations, nevertheless Royster's story is one of ideals, trials, hardships, perseverance and undeniable victory.  A Revolutionary People at War is a well-written, expertly researched analysis about character.

These \\"anxious patriarchs\\" delineated  social relations among whites, blacks and Indians by associating Indians and Africans with field labor and slavery, and by associating women with dependency.  \\"Good wives\\" were respectable, chaste and dependent members of a male-dominated society.  As time went on, planters engendered field work with race, by disassociating white women from it.  As the number of enslaved Africans increased, black women became \\"nasty wenches\\" who, because of their condition of servitude, could not avoid the labor and sexual exploitation that defined their status.  By the 1680s, she shows, taxation of African (but not white) women became the \\"cornerstone of a concept of womanhood that became less class-specific and increasingly race specific,\\" which allowed for a \\"more exclusive definition of English womanhood.\\" (128) This concept was further buttressed when Virginia lawmakers in 1662 decreed that children born of unfree mothers were slaves.  \\"The notion that enslaved women could pass their bound condition on to their children,\\" she writes, \\"strengthened the appearance that slavery was a natural condition for\\" Africans.\\" (135)<br />Brown is persuasive in her discussion of Virginia patriarchs, who by the first half of the 18th century had subordinated women to secondary public and private roles.  \\"Outspoken women\\" of any race were threats to masculine authority, particularly in the form of slander and public immorality.  Male power was based not only on \\"rights to the labor of slaves and servants,\\" (323) but on domination of their wives and daughters as well.  \\"Control over sexual access to women\\" (323) and a managerial role in marriage arrangements exemplify their position of power, which Brown points out was solidified by slave ownership.<br />Brown provides many intriguing glimpses into the lives of men and women, slaves and freemen in colonial Virginia, especially with the numerous vignettes unearthed in court records, newspapers and diaries.  In a number of instances she makes excellent use of her evidence, such as the case of William Bass, Sr.'s will (242-3), in which Brown finds that an unusual inheritance provision reveals much about how one family self-identified in terms of race.  In another case, she uses a sharp decline in white servant court appearances to suggest the rapid expansion of slave labor in Lancaster County. (251)<br />Nevertheless, several factors combine to make Good Wives, Nasty Wenches and Anxious Patriarchs unsatisfying.  Many of Brown's chapter introductions are jargon-filled, lack clarity and should have been used as conclusions instead.  Furthermore, she bases her thesis primarily on only three Virginia counties (York, Lancaster and Norfolk) and just two planters (William Byrd II and Landon Carter), which perhaps makes for too few resources from which to make many of her often sweeping generalizations.  For example, her suggestion that \\"skin color had yet to acquire much of its moral and political freight\\" (215) during the late 16th century is based solely on one councilor's commentary in one county.<br />More troubling is Brown's frequent willingness to make conclusions beyond what the evidence will bear.  Her regular use of \\"may have\\" in her prose warns of this problem.  African females' field work \\"possibly may have\\" affected a slave woman's chances for marriage, Brown claims with little support. (126)  She bases part of her discussion of 17th century bastardy court cases on \\"a few shards of evidence.\\" (191) When describing free women and their families, she points to \\"West African matrifocal residence patterns\\" in explaining the absence of black males from households-yet fails to elaborate or provide evidence of this alleged trend. (229)  Did enslaved women resent serving tea to \\"young white ladies\\" in fine homes? (286)  Possibly, but Brown produces no documentary evidence to make such a suggestion.  Finally, that \\"English women appear to have managed their sexual activities carefully with an eye toward the future,\\" is unfortunately an all-too-typical speculation. (100)<br />In addition to making a number of questionable assertions based on limited evidence, Brown also includes enough overly-speculative claims to weaken the book's overall credibility.  The contention that women appearing alone in public \\"threatened to disturb the scripting of male hierarchies\\" (281) is of debatable veracity, as is the assertion that only when gentlewomen could no longer bear children could they \\"be granted the freedom to leave the house\\" as they wished.\\" (282)  Her assertion that a newspaper report of a giant cucumber constitutes \\"implicit phallic imagery\\" of \\"colonial masculinity\\" (329) is not only absurd but is a lapse of historical professionalism as well.<br />Brown's inventive effort to study colonial Virginia in terms of gender and race is a valuable attempt to look at social constructions in an innovative light and raises as many questions as it answers.or marriage, Brown claims with little support.

NB however really did not campaign there, and devoted secondary attention to it. Neillands says that no one man played a more decisive role in that struggle than Wellington. He proved France could be defeated and his victories in Spain revived spirits of the allies. He slowly chipped away at the myth of invincibility of Napoleon. The final element contributing to Napoleon's downfall was himself. He went too far, refused to recognize enough is enough. Neillands argues that British soldiers did well against Napoleon's troops if well handled, well-positioned and could not be galled by cavalry and artillery. Well, who wouldn't be if all of these preconditions were met! The author's aim is to reduce the jumble of confusion of 20 years &amp; study the time period through men. Neillands claims that in the end W's tactical skills on the battlefield proved decisive. He doesn't say much to support this, and overlooks to a large degree the Prussian contribution to NB's defeat. NB's tactics never varied-it was to seek out the enemy and destroy his army-with blitzkrieg. Wellington knew @ command, logistics, &amp; was at ease at court. He had important political connections too. He had gained a clear idea of how, by setting attainable objectives and relying on his own force a campaign could be won. Wellington's army was superior in training, discipline, marksmanship &amp; tactical ability, says Neillands but this is open to debate as well. Tellingly, Neillands admits that most of the Peninsula campaign was a side show. What he ought to have said is that because of this, the book's title of Wellington &amp; Napoleon is a bit misleading, as NB was not directly involved in Spain for much of Wellington's tenure there. The title is a stretch. Is Neillands correct when he says that 'Wellington must be considered the greatest general of his age.' Hardly.	2003-10-08

This recognition, however, came after a long career in which Debo initially struggled against the establishment in her efforts to bring to light the plight of Native Americans in the West, particularly with regard to the ill treatment they received from land and resource hungry settlers.  And Still the Waters Run, her study of the Five Civilized Nations in Oklahoma in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, provoked controversy among her colleagues and critics, and was published not by the University of Oklahoma Press, which refused to honor its agreement to print it, but by Princeton.  This tale of the machinations of whites to defraud Native Americans and the theft of Indian property, with the many difficulties it engendered, is still in print six decades later.<br /> Simply put, And Still the Waters Run is the story of the process by which whites, in the forms of government officials and individuals hungry for land, oil and coal, dispossessed Native Americans in Oklahoma of their wealth \\"by the legislative enactment and court decree...and the lease, mortgage and deed of the land shark.\\" (vii)  This method, begun in the late 1880s, contrasted with former battles between the United States and the Indians, in which military might typically concluded all conflicts in the American West.  Instead, Debo argues that Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, Seminoles and Creeks lost their land, minerals, coal and oil through broken treaties, allotment and fraud.<br /> Depo depicts the Five Tribes in Oklahoma in the late nineteenth century as being firmly established in the new territory after the trauma of the 1830s removals.  The Indians were determined to resist further encroachments and contentions with whites, particularly with regard to land ownership.  This was not meant to be.  Debo describes a process by which whites forced treaties and congressional legislation (especially the Dawes Act of 1887) upon the various tribes in order to facilitate the expropriation of Indian lands and associated natural resources.  Loss of land was accompanied by \\"the surrender of tribal institutions,\\" (31) namely collective land holding and native councils.  Tribal regimes, Debo contends, were liquidated to facilitate the division of land among Indians, which in turn eased the process by which whites were able to purchase it.  Although she concedes that many government officials genuinely attempted to protect individual Indian allottees, \\"the general effect of allotment was an orgy of plunder and exploitation probably unparalled in American history.\\" (91)<br /> Debo goes on to detail the ineffectual government guardianship of Indian assets, and the immense graft on the part of \\"a horde of despoilers.\\" (92)  This period brought poverty and abject despair to Native peoples in Oklahoma, victims of swindlers and government bureaucrats alike.  Some relief was realized upon Oklahoma statehood and various federal laws in the early 20th century, as well as through \\"a tangle of litigation.\\" (203)  Nevertheless, Debo paints a bleak picture of the rapaciousness of whites, ineptitude among civil leaders responsible for Indian protection and helplessness of overpowered Indians.<br /> And Still the Waters Run is remarkable for the depth of its research, no less so because it was written in the 1930s by a woman without an academic position.  It is well-documented with a variety of sources including government papers, personal interviews, newspapers and manuscripts.  Nevertheless, despite the passion Debo felt for the injustices done to her subject tribes, her book suffers from dry prose and a plodding narrative.  Debo seems to describe every rule and regulation imposed on the tribes, and describes complex litigation in such detail that readers can easily lose sight of her overall theme.  Her painstaking trek through years of Indian misfortunes, while important to our understanding of western U.S. history, is unfortunately regrettably monotonous.l theme.

US	44961618	R162ABNQ34S6L7	0803287607	486727351	Cherokee Women: Gender and Culture Change, 1700-1835 (Indians of the Southeast)	Books	3	33	36	N	N	Well-written; some interpretation problems	In her well-written Cherokee Women: Gender and Culture Change, 1700-1835, historian Theda Perdue argues that \\"the story of most Cherokee women is not cultural transformation...but remarkable cultural persistence.\\"  This is not to say, she argues, that these women did not experience significant changes in their status and condition, especially if one looks at the \\"decline\\" of Native Americans only in terms of land losses and military defeats.  If, however, historians looks at \\"other indices of cultural change, including production, reproduction, religion, and perceptions of self, as well as political and economic institutions,\\"  then a different image emerges of Cherokee women over time: one of cultural persistence.  Perdue does not deny that contact with Europeans had a profound, and ultimately negative, impact on the lives and well being of native peoples, including women of the seven Cherokee clans.  She is particularly lucid in describing how the deer skin trade, military alliances and the insistence by whites of negotiating only with males in treaty making and land deals diminished much of the influence women had in terms of trade, material possessions and political status.<br />  Perdue interprets the changes in Cherokee life for men and women, beginning in the 18th century, as a cultural retooling, in which men became predominantly involved in external affairs of the tribe (war, military alliances, commercial enterprises, treaties) and women maintained internal power and status within the tribe.  \\"While women became dependent on men in some respects,\\" she notes, \\"men also relied increasingly on women to plant corn, perpetuate lineages, and maintain village life.\\"  She goes on to state that the deerskin trade may actually have enhanced the power of women within their Cherokee communities \\"by removing men for much of the year.\\"  Additionally, for most of their yearly sustenance, male hunters still relied on the bounty of agricultural production, which remained almost exclusively the domain of females.  Finally, Perdue argues that despite the encroachment of whites, the male takeover of tribal political leadership and institutions by the late 18th century, and relocation to the west by 1839, \\"a distinct culture survived removal, rebuilding, civil war, reconstruction, allotment and Oklahoma statehood.\\"  As proof of the survival and persistence of this culture, Perdue briefly points to the continuing significant role of women at the end of the 20th century.  Thus, she concludes that the fate of Cherokee women has not been one of cultural declension, but one of \\"persistence and change, conservatism and adaptation, tragedy and survival.\\"<br /> Much of Perdue's interpretation of persistence and survival of women's culture within the Cherokee clans is quite persuasive.  However, her treatment of the growing external role of men with regard to leadership and war and the corresponding decline in female power and influence on tribal matters of extreme (and ultimately devastating) importance to the Cherokees is problematic.  By arguing that the male takeover of political power and control of land allowed women to consolidate internal, domestic power within the tribes seems to make a virtue out of an inescapable necessity.  This is not to refute Perdue's recognition of the important spheres women continued to control; nevertheless, her contention that the external pressures of the U.S. government's \\"civilization program,\\" land sessions, wars and eventual removal did not result in \\"declining status and lost culture\\" may be significantly overstated.  For example, she asserts that although men dominated most aspects of commercial relations with whites, \\"women did occupy one position that had long-term implications for the Cherokees-they became wives of traders.\\"  While marriage to whites may in fact have been an effective method of survival and adaptation for Cherokee women, Perdue's use of this trend as evidence of cultural persistenceis questionable.  Similarly, Perdue argues that when Cherokee wives of British soldiers at the besieged Ft.

This study considers militia issues beyond fighting battles, including the necessity Continental officers faced using militia regiments, and the drawbacks from doing so as well.  One of the subjects in Lees study of the legitimacy of violence during the war is that of the bitter, bloody feuds between Whigs and Tories, a conflict that caused the Patriot militia to become mired in a struggle of retaliatory escalation, vendettas, plundering, murder and other crimes, all of which served to weaken the authority of the newly-created state.  For example, Lee describes the fine line between the impressment and stealing of much-needed supplies from the civilian population.  In accordance with military tradition, Lee notes, it was acceptable to impress from ones enemies without payment, an assumption which too often led to random theft.  This and other problems were a constant burden for Greene and other commanders in the south, just part of the many challenges arising from the reliance on militia troops.	2003-04-18

In several of his works, Higginbotham details the militia's history, social role, and gradually declining effectiveness as a military force by the middle of the 18th century.  The American militia leading up to the Revolutionary War, was \\"an institution that, in its actual operation, was more myth than reality, that never really stood up to professional armies in major combat, and that could scarcely do so in 1775.\\"  With regard to combat, Higginbotham writes that the militia, when employed as partisans, \\"were often effective, far less so when arranged in close rank formation against British regulars with bayonets.\\"  In addition to furnishing manpower for Continental regiments, he concludes, the militia \\"operating on the local scene or behind the lines simply had to problems of law and order, disaffection, and war weariness.\\" Additionally, \\"the state militias were equally indispensable in the war against the Revolution's internal enemies,\\" particularly in the South.  Perhaps Higginbotham's most valuable work on this subject is his own chapter in Reconsiderations on the Revolutionary War, which he edited in 1978.  In this essay, he outlines traditional views of the militia by contemporaries and historians, its functions in war, \\"motivation for service,\\" its officers, and the \\"all encompassing role\\" it was asked to play.	2003-04-18

In fact, Jennings himself was known for his \\"irrepressible\\" devotion to debunking the myths of Native American history of the colonial period, particularly the works of Francis Parkman.

He focuses primarily on the \\"inner lives of `the Other Ranks,'\\" (ibid.) whose memoirs and reminiscences allow for the creation of what he describes as \\"the `inner history'\\" of the Great War.<br />Winter structures Death's Men both chronologically and thematically.  This approach allows him to show how typical British enlistees (\\"Kitchener's Men\\") progressed from being new recruits to frontline soldiers and, if they were lucky, to returning veterans after 1918.  Military historians as well as casual readers will certainly admire Winter's thorough and vivid handling of trench warfare and the tremendous toll it took on men's lives, both physically and emotionally.<br /> The strength of Winter's book is its graphic depiction of the men in the trenches and the nature of modern warfare on the western front from 1914 to 1918. Technologically advanced weaponry such as high explosive artillery ammunition, the machine gun and flame throwers made combat hellish beyond description.  \\"The order of life,\\" Winter concludes, \\"seemed beyond the comprehension of a soldier under a barrage of gas and shells...even if a man could gather himself to contemplate anything beyond survival.\\" (115)  At times, Winter's prose is remarkable, as when he describes the infantryman as \\"object not subject.  He saw himself as the rodent occupier of a pockmarked, grassless zone, whose forward limit was determined by the very limit of human endurance. What was he but the counter in a game...\\" (Ibid.) No squalid detail is too small to evade mention by the numerous soldiers Winter employs to tell his story.  Dozens of first hand accounts culled from diaries, memoirs and letters depict the minutiae of the British foot soldier's life in France, including shrapnel wounds, trench foot, bread weevils, brothels, mustard gas attacks, and grave digging-just to list a few.<br /> Winter does not neglect the psychological effects of this modern war on the men fighting it, and devotes an entire chapter-\\"The Strain of Trench Warfare\\"-to it.  The hideous, modern \\"arsenal of weapons\\" led to a war in which \\"infantry became merely hunters and hunted.\\" (128)  The Great War, he asserts, \\"posed a greater test than any previous war.\\"  He rightly points to the reality that unlike previous wars in which battles lasted for hours or days at most, the trench-bound British soldier of the First World War \\"was hardly ever out of danger,\\" (131) where death loomed constantly.<br />Despite Winter's skill in vividly illustrating the dreadful struggles of the western front, Death's Men suffers from two major problems.  First, this is primarily an  impressionistic book, with little statistical or analytical work involved.  Winter often cites his own experiences (or those of his relatives) and makes dubious extrapolations from them, such as his first-hand knowledge of shell shock victims.  \\"Each week,\\" he reports, \\" I see in Leavesden mental hospital...a man whose memory is perfect...to 1917. Thereafter he can remember nothing.\\" (140) Aside from the question of Winter's medical qualifications to make judgments about post-combat stress victims, one wonders how accurate an extrapolation can be from just one veteran the author happens to know.  This error is known as \\"the fallacy of the lonely fact[:]...a statistical generalization from a single case.\\"  Examples of impressionistic generalizations abound in Death's Men.  Winter's sweeping claims such as \\"cleanliness was always the highest priority\\" of the soldier; (146) \\"all men feared artillery\\"; (121) and \\"all soldiers were bitterly depressed when time came to return to France\\" from leave, (169) serve to brush off exceptions to his broad, imprecise statements, most of which lack citationsand statistical support.  Although he writes that against such a diversity of soldier's war experiences  \\"generalization must clearly have its limits,\\" (17) Winter fails to heed his own advice.<br />The second, and perhaps bigger flaw of Death's Men is that it is largely an anecdotal collection of war stories, all of which serve to answer his preconceived declarative question: the war was horrible for the men who fought it.  With this closed-end hypothesis in mind, Winter seems to have trudged off to the archives and, unsurprisingly, found exactly what he was looking for.  His survey is not so much an historical inquiry as it is a compilation of individual accounts from only one of the war's theatres that he for the most part fails to interpret, quantify and contextualize.  He provides only eight footnotes in this 265-page book, a limitation that lessens the book's usefulness to other scholars, or to readers wishing to learn more.<br />Death's Men lacks a proper historical question.  It is instead a compilation of soldiers' experiences about which the author's opinion often substitutes for interpretation, such as when he harshly criticizes the army's induction and basic training system for subduing the individual in a dehumanizing manner.  \\"Our soldiers,\\" Winter opines, \\"until the last year of the war, continued to be trained as blockishly as had been Wellington's men.\\" (49)  Winter fails to provide context for his impressionistic assertion, or alternative explanations.

Eugene and Lillian Youngs Lehman Series)	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Superb	One of the most critically acclaimed studies of Wilhelm II is Lamar Cecils two-volume biography (1989, 1996 ), deemed by one reviewer as the best-available English treatment of the waning years of the last Kaiser available.  Cecils portrait of Wilhelm is largely critical: the emperor ruled maladroitly, throughout a barren career that was without virtue or accomplishment (ix); bluster, rhetoric, and natural swagger cloaked a profound emptiness, for ignorance and self-indulgence were his primary characteristics. (1).  Cecils assessment of the Kaisers war role is no less disapproving.  Domestic issues rarely interested Wilhelm II, he notes (191), and emphasizes that the Kaiser was far more enamored by foreign policy and military minutiae.  Despite this martial enthusiasm, Wilhelm was by nature peaceful, (194) and opposed war in 1914, afraid that a European conflict would distract Germany from the internal threat of socialism.<br /> Once the war began, Cecil shows, Wilhelms function was symbolic and superficial, at least as far as the imperial army was concerned.  He often resided close to the front, was occasionally exposed to hostile fire, and relished hearing the roar of the guns.  Cecil makes it clear that the Kaisers duties were limited to sending telegrams, war zone tours, medal presentations and other purely ceremonial tasksit was as empty an existence as he had had in peacetime.  Cecil flatly asserts that Wilhelms part in the war, especially as it concerned the army, took a secondary place behind the role of his officers. (210).  He was for the most part shielded by his ubiquitous military entourage, fearful that his inability to withstand the strains of warfare would break him.  The Kaisers ignorance of the true nature of the struggle in which Germany was engaged, Cecil frankly summarizes, was profound and his utility to his military leaders quite limited. He was in essence a figurehead, content merely to hear and endorse the opinions of his generals. Soon after the war began, Cecil concludes, Wilhelm became a shadow Kaiser (schattenkaiser), out of sight, neglected, and relegated to the sidelines in imperial Germanys hour of trial.

MacDonogh seems to have set out deterministically to write something other than an \\"indictment\\" of Wilhelm.  He asserts that historians have been unduly critical against the emperor for eighty years, which has prompted him to examine Wilhelm \\"in a light which, if not ridiculously positive, [is] at least a little more indulgent than that which as coloured attitudes in the past.\\" (viii)  While MacDonogh's study is not \\"ridiculously positive,\\" it does tend to minimize Wilhelm's culpability for the various blunders historians commonly associate with his reign.  While he concurs with other scholars of Wilhelmine Germany that the emperor was \\"a mass of contradictions,\\" (1) MacDonogh also minimizes the Kaiser's documented anti-Semitism, and strongly implies that the \\"cases brought up against the emperor\\" such as the Kruger telegram (1896), the \\"Hun Speech\\" of 1900, and the Daily Telegraph Affair (1908), were handled \\"reasonable, and in some cases well\\" by the Kaiser. (7)  This attempt to show that Wilhelm did not act maliciously, criminally or incompetently is what differentiates The Last Kaiser from its predecessors.<br /> In MacDonogh's account of Wilhelm's wartime role, he reaches a familiar conclusion: \\"it would be impossible to make out that he played the role of `Supreme Warlord' between 1914 and 1918.\\" (3)  He shows that Wilhelm \\"wavered over the preventive strike\\" long advocated by the General Staff, and \\"each time he looked in to the abyss he drew back in horror and countermanded\\" his generals' orders for such an attack. (9) This gives the kaiser too much of a benevolent, conscientious role for the time.  MacDonogh portrays a Kaiser swept up with the emotions and events of August 1914, a leader who allowed himself to be carried into the war.  By the first weeks of the conflict, \\"he had become increasingly peripheral.\\" (367) This declension culminated in January 1917 with Bethmann Hollweg's removal at the insistence of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, at which point Wilhelm \\"was no more than a shadow emperor.  No one listened to him.\\" (391) Probably true.....<br /> Despite showing far more sympathy toward his subject than other biographers of Wilhelm II have done, MacDonogh echoes many of their conclusions.  \\"It is perhaps right that we condemn William,\\" he suggests, \\"for if the First World War was not his undertaking, the finger of blames points over and over again to the failure of German diplomacy in which he tried so hard to play a positive role.\\" (460)  MacDonogh seems reluctant to assign Wilhelm much direct blame for the origins of the Great War or how it was conducted.  On the contrary, most students of the last Hohenzollern ruler of Germany concur with the concise biographical entry in The Oxford Companion to Military History (2001):  Kaiser Wilhelm II was \\"seduced by...nationalism and militarism,\\" and came to discover that \\"leading a cavalry charge on maneuvers...is not the same thing as presiding over a beleaguered state engaged in total war.\\"  The last German Kaiser \\"lacked the strength of character and consistency of purpose which his role demanded, and if he cannot be blamed for leading Germany into war, he may be more justly censured for what one historian has called `a childlike flight from reality' in the crisis of 1914.\\"lension culminated in January 1917 with Bethmann Hollweg's removal at the insistence of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, at which point Wilhelm \\"was no more than a shadow emperor.

US	44961618	R3SGZVR8DZ21JY	0582245591	319500861	Kaiser Wilhelm II	Books	5	18	19	N	N	great!	Cambridge historian Christopher Clarks 2000 study of the Kaiser is, despite its brevity, a concise and balanced account of Wilhelms life into which he incorporates much recent historiography of Wilhelmine Germany.  Clark paints a picture of an emperor whose power and influence gradually weakened over time.  By the late 1890s, he argues, Wilhelm had emerged as a significant factor in high politics, launching ambitious (if often doomed) legislative schemes, intriguing with individual ministers, and gradually hollowing out the authority of the chancellor. (117)  In the realm of foreign policy, however, Clark argues that Wilhelm became increasingly marginalto the real centers of policy making, particularly after several notable blunders including the Zabern incident and the Daily Telegraph affair, both of which witnessed his impetuous and undiplomatic style, to the horror of professional diplomats.<br /> With regard to the outbreak of war in 1914, however, Clark argues that while Helmuth von Moltke, chief of the German General Staff, pressed his sovereignat crucial moments in the months leading to war, at no point did the monarch surrender the power of decision to the military. (215)  Far from being a warmonger, Clark asserts, Wilhelm was reluctant to entangle Germany in a continental war, (214) and maintained his own outlook on policy [that] differed in crucial ways from that of the military leadership. (216)  He never supported the preventive war strategy espoused by top army officials, nor did he regard mobilization as irreversible.  Clark points to Wilhelms attempts to mediate between Serbia and Austria-Hungary as evidence of his reluctance to allow Germany to be sucked into a Balkan engagement in 1914. (218)  This initiative was overridden by the chancellor, Clark notes, which provides further proof of the Kaisers declining stature in affairs of the stateaffairs he could influencebut did not control. (218)<br /> What of Wilhelms involvement in the prosecution of and involvement in the Great War?  Clark concludes that the Kaisers capacity to exercise a command function was narrowly circumscribed, which considerably diluted his influence among Germanys military leaders.  Furthermore, he lacked an overview of strategic planning leading up to and including the early stages of the war because, Clark maintains, the general staff regarded him as a security risk and refused to take him in to their confidence.  As a result, he was displaced from the center of military affairs, shielded from much bad news from the front, and was excluded from the sphere of operational command of the land forcesthough he did exercise a more directinfluence on the wartime operations of the German navy.  (227)  Clark warns that one should not push the argument that the Kaiser was marginal too far.  By virtue of his position, he writes, Wilhelm was a figure of crucial importance, namely for his authority to appoint and dismiss his officers and officials. (228)  He concludes that although he was not vital militarily to the day to day running of the war, the emperor was a central figure in the processes by which some of the most central policy issues of the war years were resolved.

Davis examines the German home front during World War I by describing the severe food crisis affecting \\"a broadening population of Germans\\" (2) from the beginning of the war, particularly the lower and working classes in Berlin.  Davis asserts that \\"women of lesser means\\" (3) were hardest hit by food scarcity, inflation and governmental ineptitude in dealing with the ever-growing food crisis in Germany's capital city, and that these careworn women came to symbolize the hardships of all Germans facing starvation, price-fixing, and hoarding by producers.  \\"Gender plays a central role in this account of the war,\\" Davis announces (3), and goes on to depict the new political role women came to play by way of street riots, public protests and entrance in to the work force (most notably munitions work.)  She demands that \\"we must acknowledge the changes brought about\\" by the protests of  women of lesser means during the course of the Great War that eventually led to revolution in 1918 and the collapse of the German war effort. (234) These important changes were in the form of a \\"just distribution of material goods and political power,\\" (236) with which Berliners struggled for years to come.  Although Davis' innovative focus on lower class women consumers from 1914 to 1918 is a provocative one, Home Fires Burning suffers from a number of organizational and conceptual problems that ultimately undermine the book's success.<br /> Several problematic evidentiary questions are apparent in Home Fires Burning.  Davis uses Berlin as a microcosm for all German cities in describing the catastrophic food shortages, such as bread, potatoes and butter, and distribution problems.  Yet, despite her introduction in which she discusses Germany as a whole and a willingness to extrapolate from Berlin's example for all of Germany, Davis goes on to say that Berlin was \\"clearly unique within the empire.\\" (17) This contradiction raises a question of how representative Berlin is for the entire nation, particularly since Davis engages in very little discussion of other German cities.  Furthermore, she concludes that Berlin policemen observing rioting women in the streets gradually began to sympathize with those \\"of lesser means,\\" and eventually colored their reports to superiors with subtle calls for actions and relief. (99-103)  If it is true, however, that these police officers manipulated their statements for their own benefit, it casts doubt as to the credibility and reliability of the value of these records (upon which Davis relies heavily) as evidence-something she seems not to have questioned throughout the book.<br />Davis also commits the \\"fallacy of insidious generalization,\\"  most notably in her lack of quantification. Although Davis does provide several tables in this study and briefly discusses caloric intake quantitatively, she repeatedly generalizes in her narrative and for the most part avoids numbers.  In a lengthy discussion of special consumer privileges granted to soldiers' wives,  for example, her analysis rests on impressionistic accounts of police reports that echo resentments of those not afforded these benefits (primarily extra food coupons and rent protection.)  She provides no analysis of what this allowance meant to soldiers' wives in real terms-was it significant or meaningful?  Did those not receiving this benefit have a legitimate gripe, or were their protests based on misperceptions? Throughout this study, the reader gets little sense of the scale of the home front crisis due to a sense of imprecision.

In a nuanced thesis regarding the motivations for promoting movement of large numbers of people to the American wilderness, he also shows how long-held traditions with regard to land ownership and tenantry were transformed in America, due largely to the new environment.  Bailyn argues that after the \\"initial phase of colonization, the major stimuli to population recruitment and settlement were...the continuing need for labor, and...land speculation.\\"  The land speculation of the 17th and 18th centuries, Bailyn argues, \\"shaped a relationship between the [land] owners and the workers of the land different from that which prevailed in Europe.\\" (60)  Bailyn writes that land speculation was common in America among all classes of men, \\"a major preoccupation of ambitious people...launched as a universal business.\\" (67)  But with all of this pervasive land accumulation came an indispensable caveat; speculators needed settlers to populate the land they claimed, so that an owner could rent or sell his property.  \\"Land speculation was, and remained, boundless, ubiquitous,\\" (74) writes Bailyn, who goes on to describe the various schemes and methods speculators used \\"to people the land they claimed.\\" (69)  Yet as Bailyn points also out, long-held, customary tenancy relationships that British landowners were used to were not adaptable to America. Instead, new methods were needed to attract settlers and clear the land, so that property in the trackless wilderness would become useable, and as a result, valuable.  Bailyn argues that, unlike tenancy norms in Britain or Ireland, speculators had to let the land out at very low rates (or none at all) in an attempt to attract settlers who would in turn make improvements on the property themselves, with their own labor.  \\"The land would have a new value and could then be rented profitably or sold...all of this with little or no outlay of funds.\\" (82)  This innovative model was quite attractive to migrants, Bailyn concludes, who were free to chose upon which speculator's land to settle, and which lands to avoid.  In America, gone were the services tenants typically performed in the old country, rent increases and the caprice of landlords.  Bailyn goes on to suggest as well that unlike property limitations in  Britain, land in the colonies was \\"too easily available\\" and mobility too common among settlers for tenancy to develop permanently, or to \\"make possible a re-creation of the stable pattern of rentiers that lay at the heart of a traditional landed society.\\" New tenancy and ownership patterns \\"reveal a new and dynamic process that was a central force in the peopling of America.\\" (84-85)r.  \\"The land would have a new value and could then be rented profitably or sold...all of this with little or no outlay of funds.\\" (82)  This innovative model was quite attractive to migrants, Bailyn concludes, who were free to chose upon which speculator's land to settle, and which lands to avoid.

Axtell points to the fact that so many of the white captives in Indian hands refused to return to their own societies when given the opportunity as evidence of the profound impact native culture had on at least some British migrants to the New World.<br />Axtell concedes that these \\"white Indians\\" removed themselves from British culture and therefore mitigated the influence their newly adopted ways had on those colonists back in the settlements.  It was, however, \\"necessary for the colonists to borrow some of the Indians' time-tested skills techniques and technology for coping with the frontier environment.\\" (284)  \\"Indian means,\\" Axtell contends, \\"were not borrowed in cultural context,\\" but were taken piecemeal from the native way of life, selectively, for the benefit of the newcomers and their survival, as well as for the goal of cultural mastery.  English settlers adapted to their new land by taking or borrowing numerous Indian techniques of agriculture, language, war, hunting, and to some extent, adopting medicinal practices which relied on native (and heretofore unknown) plants and flora.  It is well known that British newcomers to America borrowed numerous native words, many of which have been permanently added to our vocabulary (potato, canoe).  Axtell points out however, that the colonists adopted elements of Indian speech \\"in distinct ways which minimized their normative impact on colonial culture.\\" Words were added to colonial speech ways only when equivalent English words did not exist, and Indian tribal and geographic names were commonly anglicized in spelling and pronunciation (289)<br />Although Axtell writes that \\"acculturation is a two way street,\\" the English clearly had no intention of making this relationship one of equality.  As an example, he notes that while early settlers needed to master use of native materials for building shelter upon arrival on American shores, \\"the wigwam had no lasting effect on colonial culture.\\" (291).  Nevertheless, the neighboring Indians did have a lasting and pervasive effect on colonial society in more subtle ways.  Axtell advances the suggestion that \\"the realities of Anglo-Indian relations was the reordering of colonial priorities,\\" which included the conversion of natives to Christianity, increased overseas trade, and the expansion of the British Empire in the American provinces. (304-305) All of these goals emphasized for imperialists in London and America the need for pacification of the Indians, which Axtell holds was the overriding priority of the colonists in British America once they became firmly established on these shores by the late 17th century.ere taken piecemeal from the native way of life, selectively, for the benefit of the newcomers and their survival, as well as for the goal of cultural mastery.

These exiles fled jail, impending execution, or banishment as a result of their military, political or social activities in England, Scotland or Ireland, and are described in Michael Durey's comprehensive study &quot;Transatlantic Radicals and the Early American Republic.&quot;  \\"Many radicals,\\" Durey states, \\"experienced severe culture shock in the first months after their arrival.\\" (176) and had to adjust to the reality that naïve images they had of America before fleeing their homeland were often untrue.  For many, he suggests, coming to America meant treading a difficult path, politically and socially, which eventually led to marginalization.  These men had to find work quickly, and many became teachers and newspapermen in the process of adjusting to new lives.  Durey concludes that a large number of refugees began fresh careers in \\"one general area, the creation and dissemination of knowledge, cultural, political, pedagogical, and scientific.\\" (200)  Those of religious faith in the former lands latched on to their church in America as a way of gaining a foothold and acclimating to a new country.  The most profound divergence of acculturation took place among the radicals with regard to slavery, Durey finds.  Most if not all exiles had been anti-slavery while in Britain and Ireland; \\"no such unanimity can be found in their reactions to slavery after their emigration,\\" for as a practical problem, the issue divided them once in the United States.  (289)  \\"The acculturation of the exiles to the regions in which they settled,\\" he concludes, played a large role in how the &eacute;migr&eacute;s responded to the abolition question, i.e., they adopted the predominat views of the states in which they settled. (283.)<br /> It is notable that with the possible exception of the late 18th century radical &eacute;migr&eacute;s from the British Isles, no group of immigrants discussed above came upon these shores to a veritable Eden, or an unoccupied, virgin land waiting to be conquered or \\"developed.\\"  Seventeenth century Englishmen encountered native tribes upon arrival in America; slaves faced a rigid, white-mastered plantation system firmly established.  Congregation members in Puritan New England reacted to an entrenched, privileged clergy; Ulster Scots faced hostile frontier natives and more established, \\"English-like\\" elites of the settled East.  These encounters with predecessors necessitated acculturation by those peoples who came to America, willingly, reluctantly or against their will.  Some of these groups triumphed-rich sugar planters, Virginia land speculators-while others struggled to survive-slaves, dirt poor Scotch-Irish on the frontier, and political radicals.  Yet regardless of their destinies, each of these groups underwent the necessary and inevitable process of change-adaptation-which profoundly shaped their lives and societies in ways in their new land, and helped to create what we call American culture today.al migrs from the British Isles, no group of immigrants discussed above came upon these shores to a veritable Eden, or an unoccupied, virgin land waiting to be conquered or \\"developed.\\"   Seventeenth century Englishmen encountered native tribes upon arrival in America; slaves faced a rigid, white-mastered plantation system firmly established.

These rapacious men, he argues, quickly adapted to harsh climatic conditions by abandoning the use of lower class but white indentured servants in favor of exploitable, controllable Negroes once the sugar boom created a demand.  \\"The rape's progress was fatally easy,\\" Dunn notes: \\"from exploiting the English poor to abusing colonial bondservants to ensnaring kidnaps and convicts to enslaving black Africans.\\" (73)  Unlike his Chesapeake or Lowcountry counterpart, the West Indies sugar lord produced nothing but his staple crop, and relied instead on imports for all other necessities.  \\"In short, the English sugar planter was more strictly a businessman than the senhor de engenho of Brazil.\\" (65)  This was a marked difference from other English settlement and colonization patterns, which Dunn concludes is evidence of the atypical class of planter the Caribbean islands fashioned.	2003-01-01

One was \\"Yankee\\" from New England and the other foreign, particularly Germans, Swedes, Norwiegens and some Irish. The latter formed isolated, insular communities and tried to reconsturct communities based on a shared religous, cultural and linguistic commonality. This was looked on with alarm by many Americans, who worried that these folks would not assimilate and were dangerous to traditional American republicanism. Unfortunatley, Gjerde sounds much more like a sociologist than a historian, esp. when he comes to describe the \\"tension filled\\" families of those from Europe who (to Gjerde) were too hard on their spouses, made their children work without paying them for it (horrors!) and perhaps had loveless, unemotional relationships with their spouses (though Gjerde provides no credible evidence for this last concoction.) He also has a Berkeley professor's view of the farm----he continually describes the work as onerous, arduous, brutal, drudgery, etc. He never considers the joy and satisfaction from working the land, even if it is at times hard. I suspect the nearest Gjerde has been to a farm is the produce section at his food coop.<br />Although there are some merits to the book, Gjerde's poor use of evidence (relies on novels as factual evidence instead of, well, facts!), his overuse of academic jargon, ridiculous depiction of children and the family, and omiting a discussion of populism make this book one to avoid.	2002-11-08

In Pursuits of Happiness, Jack Greene's objective is to examine the social development and economic change in Great Britain's colonies from 1660 to 1760, and to observe the development of American culture emerging at the end of the American Revolution.  He uses an overarching, macro-historical framework in which he looks at the British colonies in the Caribbean, mainland North America and Ireland and classifies each in to one of two models: a developmental pattern represented most clearly by the Chesapeake region, and a declension pattern, exemplified exclusively by the New England colonies \\"around which much British colonial history has been organized.\\" (xi)  Greene's developmental model is one in which settlements move from loosely organized, primitive ventures to economically highly elaborated, institutionally stable and socially mature provinces; in other words, they become \\"more settled, cohesive, and coherent.\\" (81)  He focuses almost exclusively upon refuting the conviction that New England was representative of British pre-Revolutionary colonization attempts, and maintains instead that the Chesapeake region was not only far more similar to early modern Britain than was New England, but that every other colony (including Ireland) mirrored the Chesapeake settlements.  Although he offers a concluding chapter in which he describes the various mainland settlements as \\"becoming increasingly alike\\" (170) as the American Revolution approached, for the most part, Greene's New England is emphatically anomalous in the overall picture of Britain's colonies.  To paint this historiographical portrait, however, Greene chooses a selective definition and application of \\"declension,\\" ignores contradictory evidence, and reaches his foreordained conclusions based on what are obviously rigidly held assumptions. Perhaps it is Greene's relentless determination to debunk the traditional interpretation of early America in which New England is held to be \\"normative\\" (5) of Britain's colonial settlement that leads one to question his approach to this question and to cast some doubt as to the credibility of his argument.  As one reviewer notes, Greene \\"resents the central position that New England has held\\" over the years in colonial historiography and \\"never relents in his quest for an alternative explanation.\\"  While it is of course perfectly legitimate and appropriate to search for such an alternative, Greene's decision to ignore some evidence and patterns that do not fit his model is to a large extent disingenuous.  His selective handling of facts, woven into a conclusion so at odds with prior interpretations and so neatly packaged summon forth Professor Robert Berkhofer's admonition: \\"You should examine the author's main points, how they went about explicating them and the sets of assumptions that made for their works being exactly the way they are.\\"  This is not to object to Greene's refusal to conclude that colonial New England is the model for social development and that the Chesapeake is a deviant example of British colonization.  Rather, we can look deeper in to Pursuits of Happiness and learn much from what we read and what we do not read, and consider Greene's assumptions and main points as Berkhofer recommends that we do.  Greene's desire to see order, stability, and social maturation in the colonies he describes allows him to minimize and dehumanize slavery, and much else that is unpleasant, disorganized or objectionable in Britain's colonial provinces.  Institutions and structures to him are aesthetically desirable, meaningful and define a modern society.  He looks from the top down.  Greene's use of this approach is why we do not \\"see\\" people in the book-slaves in particular are missing, but so too are New England farmers, women, American Indians, and others.  This lack of human subjects is somewhat ironic, in that Greene's goal was to \\"formulate a model of social development.\\" (xi, italics mine)  Pursuits of Happiness is fundamentally a reactionary survey, aimed squarely at refuting those studies that have emphasized the typicality of the New England experience.  Greene assumed preemptively that the Chesapeake was more reflective of early modern Britain, and more typical of her colonies.  By emphasizing declension in New England and defining it in his own terms, Greene of course found what he was looking for: a Chesapeake model more modern and developed than New England, one that all other British colonies resembled.  Only by ignoring contradictory experiences and discontinuities, as Cronon holds that all narratives do, does Greene succeed in finding his settled, cohesive, and coherent colonies.entally a reactionary survey, aimed squarely at refuting those studies that have emphasized the typicality of the New England experience.

Since the book was written pre-DNA, the treatment of Sally Hemmings is somewhat dated now, but I still found this to be an excellent read and an interpretive bonanza.	2002-06-07

It offers no new insights, has very little arguement in it, and as such, there are far better single-volume works out there to be read.  The book starts out very well in describing life in the 18th century on the eve of the war; it quickly goes down hill from there.  Middlekauf does not seem to understand the British Army of the time either, as he frequently refers to British regiments by their Victorian-era names.  I recommend John Alden's book instead.	2002-06-04

She points out that many of these communists were persecuted by conservatives (professional patriots she sometimes calls them) but liberals as well.  She does a fine job describing the history of the CP in the US, especially how \\"mainstream\\" it appeared during the early New Deal.<br />Schrecker tells us how far reaching McCarthyism came to be in the US, and that it ruined individuals who were blacklisted or imprisoned.  McCarthyism led to the silencing of political, artistic, and intellectual expression, as many were afraid to proclaim sentiments that might be deemed verboten by those with the power to ruin them. It was easy for anti-Communist sentiment to take root in the mainstream of American culture, she contends, as heightened insecurity and fear of the USSR made it seem plausible that evil agents were under every bed plotting to kill Americans or at the very least destroy our culture.<br />Schrecker's strength is that she shows how far the reach of the government was in finding the people it sought, and how strong was the public support behind it.  It is clear that constitutional liberties were in some cases overlooked, though the author seems to overlook herself that we were at war with a powerful foe at the time.  Lincoln resorted to the same measures when he was trying to save the Union from dissolving.  Schrecker's failure to mention this (as well as her failure to compare McCarthyism with the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798 under Pres. John Adams) shows a lack of historical perspective on her part.<br />While I would have to say that this thesis is plausible and that the book is competent, I am overall dissatisfied with it, and somehow I am not sure I'm getting the whole picture.  To state on page ix that \\"for some reason, this book touched an ideological nerve\\" is either demonstrates an incredible naïvet&eacute; on Schrecker's part, or a smug disingenuousness that makes me skeptical from the outset.  When she writes that if she were writing the book now she would \\"acknowledge more conclusively than I did that the American Communists spied for the Soviet Union,\\" she in effect admits that she is a poor researcher.  Where was she looking when she first wrote the book?  Although reams of documents are now available to researchers with the fall of the USSR, had Schrecker gone to the trouble of carefully examining what materials existed before this new cache of documents became available she would have found testimony, deposition transcripts, court documents, memoirs, letters, newspaper articles, etc., all showing that-surprise! -the Rosenburgs were spies, and so was Alger Hiss!  I suspect that Schrecker did not find what she wasn't looking for-guilt on the part of Soviet agents.  Nevertheless her admission in the new preface shows little contrition for such shabby research.or a smug disingenuousness that makes me skeptical from the outset.

Renda asks two questions in this well-written book: \\"who did US American men think they were in Haiti and how did the people of the United States imagine themselves when they read about their nation's occupation there?\\" (9) She structures her study in two parts, in order to answer each of these concerns.<br /> Statesmen, diplomats and soldiers of the U.S. involved in the invasion and occupation of Haiti in the second decade of the 20th century brought with them a piece of cultural baggage known as paternalism.  By observing and reacting to Haiti with this frame of reference, U.S. Americans almost universally saw their duty as occupiers as being in the role of parent to the native Haitians, to bring to the island and its people the benefits of what U.S. Americans regarded as order, stability, secure commerce and modern, rational customs.  \\"Paternalism,\\" she notes, \\"was the cultural flagship of the United States in Haiti.\\" (15) As agents of U.S. cultural conscription, Marines tried to remake Haiti in to something of their own image of American society primarily through coersive means, though this largely failed due to Haitian resistance.  Nevertheless, attitudes toward race, gender and sexuality the soldiers brought with them was the lens through which they viewed this island to be tamed. The racism of the Marines made them see the native Haitians as either ignorant \\"children,\\" or savages not worthy to rule themselves.  Through this paternalistic discourse, policy makers \\"appealed to the marine's sense of manhood,\\" (303) which made the later look on their roles as that of fathers to children.  This of course did not apply to the rebels they were expected to kill.  \\"Seeing people of African heritage as children,\\" Renda concludes, \\"enabled marines to imagine themselves acting on protective and disciplining motivations.  Seeing them as targets, however, did not.\\" (156)<br /> Renda argues in chapters 5 and 6 that the Marines' occupation in Haiti had a pronounced effect upon U.S. citizens at home; it was a military intervention that remade U.S. America.  She writes that the US imperialism \\"could...intervene in domestic cultural politics,\\" (185) and she attempts to support this claim by pointing to the popularity of the journalism of American writer James Weldon Johnson, Eugene O'Neill's hit play about a Caribbean leader entitled The Emperor Jones, a novel, film, and cruise line travels to the island in the 1920s.  With regard to these claims, Renda is unconvincing.  It is difficult to agree with her conclusion that Haiti was \\"no sideshow\\" (15) given other larger and more significant U.S. ventures abroad including World War I, the administration of the Panama Canal, and continued U.S. involvement in the Pacific Islands.  Renda acknowledges this issue herself by quoting NAACP President Moorfield Story: \\"It is very hard to get the people to consider anything except the war [in Europe.]\\" (189) Additionally, Renda offers no convincing evidence as to how many Americans actually read Johnson's work or cruised the islands; the mere fact that critics acclaimed O'Neill's play is hardly proof of a significant intervention in cultural politics.<br /> Despite these limitations, Taking Haiti is an excellent study of the imperialism of the U.S. in which Renda identifies clearly the racial, sexual and gender apparatus that came along with the marines, all under the cloak of interventionist paternalism, the \\"cultural fabric\\" of Haitian occupation.

McMillen explores this society of racial apartheid from the vantage point of the oppressor and the oppressed, for as he states in his preface, \\"until historians adequately explored the exterior forces that operated on the black community there could be no truly adequate histories of the interior life of the people within that community.\\"  He includes many descriptions of Mississippi during this \\"race-haunted\\" time from blacks themselves, which adds significantly to the texture of McMillen's \\"bottom up\\" depiction of how truly repressive the white regime was.  What quickly emerges from this straightforward study is a society dominated without question by whites, one in which whites sought to re-establish race relations as they existed prior to the Civil War.  They largely succeeded.<br /> What strikes the reader forcefully from the beginning of McMillen's book is how insidiously prevalent the system known as Jim Crow was in Mississippi, and how it affected every aspect of black life.  Jim Crow did not mean that blacks were simply in effect denied the right to vote and had limited economic opportunities, though to be sure both of these hurdles existed.  White supremacy, as McMillen deftly points out, meant far more than denied voting rights and low-rung jobs.  It meant (either de facto or de jury) poor or no high schools, lynchings, outrageous jury verdicts and trials, harassment for succeeding in traditionally white professions, no libraries, etc.  The sheer scope and overriding predominance of white supremacy in Mississippi is shocking, especially since whites really did not seek to hide it from prying Northerners.  White supremacy transcended class lines for the most part, McMillen show us, and even acted as a greater force upon whites than economic self-interest.  For example, every white owner of a store, restaurant, garage, theatre, etc., who refused to serve blacks was also losing the money blacks would have paid them.<br /> McMillen concludes that from the 1890s to the middle of the 20th century very few blacks overcame the high political and economic barriers placed in their way by a Mississippi society bent on oppressing them.  Blacks in that state, however, managed to create and maintain their own separate political, religious, educational and social institutions despite the odds against them.  Those who could, moved away from Mississippi, much like the oppressed and degraded Irish left their native island to escape the shackles of British economic and sectarian control.  Truly, Mississippi's society was born of hatred of blacks by whites, a situation not totally eradicated by the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.store, restaurant, garage, theatre, etc., who refused to serve blacks was also losing the money blacks would have paid them.  <br /> McMillen concludes that from the 1890s to the middle of the 20th century very few blacks overcame the high political and economic barriers placed in their way by a Mississippi society bent on oppressing them.

Furthermore, these imported policies and reforms (mostly from Britain and Germany) were not adopted in America (if at all) unchanged upon reaching the Atlantic's western shores, but instead were adapted to the peculiarities and idiosyncrasies of American society and political structure.  Finally, Rodgers argues, the seeds of the New Deal can be found in the activities and positions of the social reform activists of the last two decades of the 19th century and the first thirty years of the 20th century.<br />  Rodgers convincingly supports his thesis by describing \\"a largely forgotten world of transnational borrowings and imitation, adaptation and transformation\\" (7) from the 1870s through the 1940s, a time during which Americans had an abundance of solutions to the myriad social problems of their day.  This \\"borrowing\\" was a process that changed significantly over time.  Initially, Americans were primarily recipients of reform ideas from abroad.  Later, during the prosperity of the 1920s, a more even exchange of social solutions took place among North Atlantic countries, which eventually led to \\"a great gathering...of proposals and ideas\\" in the New Deal.  Finally, by the end of World War II, the differing experiences of the nations of the North Atlantic world and the varying effects suffered by each from the conflict largely ended the former transnational exchange, and saw the Cold War rise of American exceptionalism.<br /> Rodgers provides numerous convincing examples of the cross-national exchange process of ideas and reforms to illustrate his arguments.  Workmen's compensation insurance in America, for example, was based upon a pre-World War I British model, a \\"ready made solution with a history of success behind it\\" (248) that made similar acts in the U.S. possible.  Additionally, housing, health and streetcars were a major concern of American social reformers in large cities, who often borrowed ideas about municipally-guided urban and industrial projects from experiments and visions in Berlin and London.  As Rodgers notes regarding the new \\"self-owned\\" city, \\"municipalization was the first important Atlantic-wide progressive project...[that] borrowed experience and transnational example.\\" (159) European precedents gave American progressives \\"a set of working, practical examples.\\" (144) \\"He describes, however, in chapters 5 and 6, the impossibility of wholesale American import of strong European municipality due to the unique and equally strong traditions in the U.S. in favor of property rights, a tradition buttressed and maintained by legal tradition and the courts.  One need only look at excess condemnation, widely practiced in Paris and London, to see an example of reforms disallowed by the courts, which held that public interests of taste and beauty did not surmount the rights of property owners.  Housing in America \\"was a private matter,\\" (196) unlike the European examples progressives saw.<br /> Although some reviewers have taken exception with Rodgers' claim that within the progressive movement's ideology one can see the footers of the New Deal, his argument is convincing.  What New Dealers \\"did best,\\" he asserts, \\"was to throw in to the breach, with verve and imagination, schemes set in motion years or decades before.\\" (415) A large number of New Deal projects came out of the old Atlantic progressive connection, and in \\"gathering in so much of the progressive agenda, the New Deal gathered in large chunks of European experience as well.\\" (416)<br />Perhaps the weakness in Atlantic Crossings is that which is left out, not in the arguments Rodgers articulately presents.  First, it is surprising that Rodgers presents no detailed discussion regarding education reform, particularly when this issue was so important to the Germans at the time.  Second, one would never know that there was an American South during this time period, a region where progressives were active even despite a lack of urban areas there. Nevertheless, Rodgers has done a masterful job of comparative history by emphasizing trans-national borrowing and cooperation.pean experience as well.\\" (416)<BR>Perhaps the weakness in Atlantic Crossings is that which is left out, not in the arguments Rodgers articulately presents.

These men and women believed that race as a social classification would decline in importance in favor of class.  Yet just as the hopes of Agrarian radicals were thwarted by the harsh the realities of the two-party system, so too were the dreams of Reconstruction-era blacks crushed by the resurgence of white supremacy and the systematic attempts by whites to disenfranchise the Negro.  Gilmore presents this tale of high hopes and shattered dreams in her first chapter, \\"Place and Possibility.\\"<br /> Gilmore's story is one of perseverance among the increasingly subjugated blacks of North Carolina after Reconstruction ended, in particular, the struggle of middle class black women to maintain power, dignity and to some degree control over their lives and communities.  By the 1890s, the ugly image of white supremacy showed its face, as white men fought a successful battle to disenfranchise black men through the instrument of fear, that is to say, fear for the safety of white women from the ravenous clutches of Negro rapists.  As Gilmore details, this sexually based contrivance branded black men as beasts and drove them from the political realm.  Articulate black women, she argues, stepped in to this cultural and political vacuum to coordinate with whites (especially white women and Northern reformers) to get social services and to work for \\"racial uplift,\\" especially through church and voluntary associations such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union.  Gilmore notes that these types of activities were not as exposed to white restrictions or ire as overt political action, and thus helped to assure some success by these middle-class black females.  It seems that black women could travel within certain community and political circles that were no longer open to their male counterparts.<br /> Gender and Jim Crow is an innovative look at post-Reconstruction race relations, in that the chief actors in Gilmore's tale are women.  It nicely dovetails with Kantrowitz's Ben Tillman and the Reconstruction of White Supremacy, in that we see similar examples of the creation of Jim Crow and the use of sexual fears to bolster notions of white supremacy as well as white political solidarity.  While Kantrowitz shows that Ben Tillman was representative of many of white Southerners of his day, I am unconvinced that Gilmore's subjects are as representative.  Her geographic realm is limited to one state of the Upper South, North Carolina; did black women carve out a similar role for themselves in the Deep South as well?  Additionally, her cast of characters is quite small, and perhaps we are drawn to these women and their story because of its very exceptionalsim and not its typicality.  Nevertheless, Gilmore's new and nuance perspective is groundbreaking and valuable in that we see the era of Jim Crow from a viewpoint previously unexplored.ere not as exposed to white restrictions or ire as overt political action, and thus helped to assure some success by these middle-class black females.

First, I found the book curiously lacking people, that is, a human texture. While Cronon does occasionally report the descriptions by individuals of Chicago, railroads, farming, etc., there is a hollowness to his study in that detailed accounts of working conditions, opposition to speculation, and the abuses of the railroads (just to name a few) are lacking. This is not a \\"history from the bottom up\\" type of study, and my impression is that more of this would help make Nature's Metropolis a \\"braided narrative.\\"<br />Cronon argues, \\"this book is...an effort to understand the city's place in nature.\\" (8) His thesis that the line between city and country is an abstraction and that what was constructed by man at Chicago was a \\"second nature\\" is contrived, and ultimately unconvincing. Cronon argues that the perceived differences between Chicago and the Great West is a \\"false boundary,\\" a premise I find absurd. While railroads had advantages over wagon and sail, these advantages were part of human constructs, not \\"nature\\" as Cronon implies on page 72. \\"The railroads centered on Chicago,\\" he states (67) \\"not because nature ordained that they had to do so...but because investors and everyone else who acted on booster theories proclaimed that they should do so.\\" That is not nature, despite Cronon's strained attempts to imply it. This (an the numerous other examples he notes throughout the text) manufactured \\"nature\\" of Cronon's is a major distraction to an otherwise satisfying study.	2002-02-11

This book does a fine job summarizing today's cultural pressures to spend and consume, to make more money and spend more time making it, all at the expnse of our families and personal sanity.  Indeed, many books do the same thing; pointing out what is wrong with our spend-spend-spend culture these days is like shooting fish in a barrel. The authors provide several good examples of folks who got caught up in the world of consumption, credit card debt and keeping up with the Jones's.  If you are looking for practical solutions for simplifying your life on an everyday, prectical level, however, this is not the book to read.  As I feared they would, the authors rely almost exclusively on radical, unrealistic eco-solutions based upon environmental activism to recommend ways of living more simply.  That might be OK for states, nations and communities to use, but for the individual looking for ways to cut back, relax, spend more time at home with loved ones, Affluenza is decidedly lacking.  For folks trying to find realistic ways of not working so many hours and spending too much on possessions, the authors' recommendations of not eating red meat and eliminating your annual vacation to the beach border on absurd.  Even more absurd is the conclusion: this book recommends heavy-handed, intrusive governtment solutions (including legistlation to cut back the work week) as &quot;the answer&quot; along with radical environmentalism.  Nowhere do the authors recommend religous or spiritual ideas to help people reduce their work hours and conspicuous consumption, a serious flaw to this study.  Big government is not the answer to this issue.	2002-02-05

Populism sprung from the \\"movement culture\\" that gave individuals and agricultural communities an avenue to make history and address their own economic and social needs, and rose from older traditions of rural cooperation and radical republicanism.<br />Despite this seedbed of support for the rise of cooperative alliances and, later, populist political parties, McMath shows that old allegiances to the Democratic Party in the South and a more recent adherence to the Republican Party elsewhere dissuaded many farmers and laborers from carrying the Populist banner, which prevented the new party from achieving lasting gains.  \\"In the end,\\" he laments, the Populist movement \\"failed to bend the forces of technology and capitalism toward humane ends.\\" (211) He also concludes that the base of the movement was too limited geographically to carry a presidential election, and suffered from being \\"caught in the cross fire between\\" the two major, institutionalized political parties by the late 1890s. (208)<br /> McMath successfully makes his case that Populism was the inheritor of earlier \\"movement\\" traditions of anti-monopolism and unionism, part of \\"cultures of protest.\\"  In the New South, for example, \\"old habits of mutuality, old relations between people on the land, were being transformed into new and more distinctly capitalistic relations...[nevertheless] old times there were not forgotten.\\" (29) He shows that the men and women who supported the Alliance and the Populist party were ardently egalitarian in their republicanism and producersim.  McMath lucidly demonstrates, however, that these farmers were never anti-capitalists who sought to return to a romantic \\"golden age\\" of Jeffersonian agrarianism.  They wanted fairness and opportunity, credit and control of their lives and communities.<br /> McMath effectively depicts the Populist movement as one of protest originating in rural America among people with legitimate economic and social grievances against monopolistic, capitalist forces.  His use of a succinct narrative approach to portray this story in a \\"rise and fall\\" style shows the change over time between 1877 and the presidential election of 1898 that doomed chances of electoral success for Populists.  McMath holds that initially farmers formed cooperatives and alliances for economic advantages, so-called \\"pecuniary benefits.\\"  By the late 1880s, he shows that the consolidation of labor and rural agricultural groups into \\"a permanent cooperative movement and labor party\\" was very much a possibility. (83) The great debate that followed was one over the decision to form a new political party or to lobby within and as part of the major parties (fusion).  In the end, Populists tried both, and though some elections were won and limited political gains made, failure was the ultimate result.  Many Southerners refused to leave their sacred Democratic party, while the Republicans successfully campaigned against incumbent Democratic President Grover Cleveland, and attracted \\"populist\\" votes in the process.  McMath shows that after 1892 populism changed its character as the silver issue \\"crowded out\\" other reform concerns, and reduced reform politics to the \\"lowest common denominator.\\"  Lamentably for McMath, whose sympathies lie unabashedly with the populists about whom he writes, by the 1890s the populist cause-turned-political party inevitably ran \\"headlong in to the sobering realities of American politics. (170) Still, he argues, the reformers \\"fashioned a space within which Americans could begin to imagine alternative futures shaped by the promise of equal rights,\\" a legacy \\"waiting to be fulfilled.\\" (211)<br /> McMath's straightforward account of the promise of reform and its ultimate political failure is a successful introduction to the study of American populism of the late 19th century.cess.

Although this book was written by a full professor at the Univ. of SC, it is nothing but a disappointment. In fact, given that an academic wrote it, I was very surprised to find the prose simplistic to the point that I had to check to see if it was written for younger readers, say 5th grade. It wasn't.  Edgar using short, vague, imprecise sentences which generalize far too much and read like a juvenile comic book.  He offers no interpretive angles and rashes the secondary sources of many other historians.  I do not see one notation in the sources in which he used the Nathanael Greene papers, or other primary sources.  Seems like he wrote the book on a whim or to indulge a hobby, and it must be an embarrassment to the U of SC.  The cover illustration is absurd-it appears to be a painting of a reenactment, not an actual event. The publisher included an engraving of what purports to be Banastre tarleton but most certainly is not.  In short, I recommend avoiding this romantic, sentimental and unsatisfying book.  I recommend instead books by Pancake, Merrill and Lumpkin on the same topic.	2002-01-25

This is not a romanticized account of soldiers vs. savages.  Rather, this is a history of the redcoat himself, not a chronological account of the French and Indian War (If you want the latter, simply read Fred Anderson's superb &quot;Crucible of War.&quot;) Brumwell describes the redcoat's life, background, recruitment, service, etc. through a variety of perspectives, including one quite  interesting chapter on the use of Highland regiments in America.  His detailed account of how soldiers were recruited, drafted and transferred for service in the British regiments during this period is particularly valuable.  This author strives to make the point that the &quot;man in the ranks&quot; who shouldered a musket under very trying conditions, for poor pay and in dangerous conditions, should be seen as the main reason for the success of British arms in the colonies.	2002-01-04

Books	3	50	92	N	Y	Curious	The first question I asked myself prior to reading the book was: &quot;How will this book be different than Leyburn's book on the same subject, written in the 60s?&quot; Not much. Given the number of studies, articles, etc covering this very topic it would have been valuable for griffin to have included a bibliographical essay to outline how his study breaks new ground.  Still, Griffin does a thorough job outlining why the Protestant Dissenters left Ulster for the shores of America.  However, his title &quot;People With No Name&quot; is curious, as these folks had several names (Ulster Scots, Presbyterians, Scots Irish, Dissenters) all of which Griffin acknowledges.  It was also dissapointing to see a dissertation/book once again ignore Catholic migrants to America from Ireland. Catholics in Ireland are only mentioned on 7 of this book's 173 pages. No comparison is made between Griffin's Ulster Scots (or whatever he decides to call them) and their Catholic neighbors who surely underwent the same economic, agricultural, etc. trials in the 18th century.<br />  Finally, on the back cover of the paperback, there is extremely high praise for the book from T. H. Breen, professor of history at Northwestern Univ.  He calls the book &quot;masterful,&quot; etc.  Seeing how Breen was Griffin's Ph.D. dissertation advisor and presumably had a guiding role in the writing of this study, such praise seems out of place and distateful; Breen should have had the taste and sense of manners to skip the submission such a &quot;blub&quot; on the back cover.	2001-11-11

That is to say this book is a description of about 20 historians of the twentieth century in Medieval studies, and how they interpreted the Middle Ages of Europe.  Despite what the dust jacket comments say, it is certainly not an accessible book for the general public, as a firm understanding of historiographical and interpretive methods and jargon is required as background in order to make sense of this study.

However, the author misses the boat on some VERY key issues, one of which has to do with chosing a school and getting in and out as fast as you can.  Peters recommends that you chose a Ph.D. program that does not have a foreign language requirement; this, he argues, will shorten your stay at a university because you will not have to spend time learning a language and taking the test. However, in the humanities ALL of the best schools (and the second tier schools as well) have this requirement, and if one takes Peters advice and choses a school without a requirement, chances are very, very strong that the school will not be one from which a graduate will have any hope at all of getting a job after graduation!  This is a very important consideration, one which Peters ignores.  You shouldn't!!!	2001-10-28
