And I read it in record time.  The writing is smooth and the pages turn quickly.  But there just isn't much to recommend.  The two main characters were okay, but I never came to care if they got together either way.  The secondary characters were more interesting and I wish their particular story had been fleshed out more.  In fact, had the main characters and the secondary ones switched the story would have been more interesting. Seeing old characters was fun and added to the plot, but overall I was disappointed in this book.  It isn't an awful book, it just isn't very memorable.	2005-08-15

After reading Ms. London's BEAUTY QUEEN, I was anxious to read MISS FORTUNE.  However, the book just never caught on with me and the heroine is definitely someone I wouldn't want to know or be.  I have a problem with romance novel heroines who are in their 30's and still living off their parents yet get angry when their life goals, etc. are questioned.  After a while I gave up on Rachel and wondered what anyone would see in her.  She really had no redeeming values.  I did like the book's hero more and loved how Ms. London used a lot of British slang with this character.  I found him charming, but once again, couldn't see what he saw in his lady love.	2004-12-11

Having just reread this book for the third time, I thought it was time to write a review and let others know about this beautiful little gem of a book.  The story is set after WWII and centers around two souls who were damaged during the war. Mary, a Polish immigrant, suffered greatly at the hands of the Nazis. Nelson, a young American G.I., lost part of his leg to the war and thinks his life is over.  Both of these souls feel unlovable and unworthy, but find that through God's grace they can begin to love and trust again.  The book can be read in one sitting, but I like to savor it.	2004-12-11

BLIND RUN is a fast-paced, page-turner filled with more twists and turns than a country back road.  The novel centers around an ex-CIA agent, Ethan Decker, who walked away from his career after his young son is killed.  Now, three years later still living in utter agony, another agent under diress leaves her two children in his care.  Without giving too much of the plot away, Ethan, rejoins with his ex-wife and the two kids in an attempt to keep them all safe.  Along the way, he faces his fears and demons from the past and sets to build a new life.  There is plenty of mystery and intrigue to keep the reader guessing what's coming next and the author left an opening at the end to expand on the characters' futures.  Ms. Lewin has a gripping writing style that draws the reader into the character's lives.  I look forward to reading more by this author.	2004-02-25

Having read just about every book published by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, I couldn't wait to get my hands on her newest offering, AIN'T SHE SWEET. I must admit I was expecting more of a light-hearted comedy reminiscent of the humor found in her \\"Chicago Stars\\" books.  But what I did find was a powerful redemption tale that dealt with the darker side of the human psyche. The book brought to mind another \\"redemption tale\\" of SEP's, DREAM A LITTLE DREAM. Like many readers who start out reading AIN'T SHE SWEET, I had the idea in the back of my mind that the book's heroine was way past deserving forgiveness and thought to myself, \\"Ms. Phillips, there's no way you are going to make me like Sugar Beth!\\". However, in the SEP's world no character is beyond hope and by the end of the book, I found myself truly fulfilled to learn that bad starts can lead to happy endings and that bad girls can do good.	2004-02-22

While I have a few quibbles about undeveloped secondary plots/characters, I have to say that I absolutely loved the hero and heroine of this contemporary romance.  The setting and premise were unusual and the author's use of humor showed through.  The heroine, Angel, was tough but not one of the \\"kick-a@$\\" heroines I have grown to loathe.  She's had a difficult past but it doesn't keep her from following her dreams and goals.  She doesn't wallow in self-pity.  And the hero, Cooper, was sexy, sweet, and a guy who loves his family - a real keeper.  I read this book in just two sittings and very much enjoyed it.	2004-01-30

Although I grew up with liberal-leaning teachers who ALMOST had me convinced Ronald Reagan was the devil, somehow deep down I knew that this was a good man.  This book is a refreshing read, and one that I enjoyed very much. In fact, I plan on giving it to my dad and father-in-law for Christmas gifts.  The passage about Ronald Reagan's favorite joke (about the optimist/pessimist twins) was funny and insightful and offered us a glimpse of this wonderful human being.	2003-09-28

These ladies are hilarious and really know what they are talking about.  I saw the ladies on \\"So Graham Norton\\" and Susannah was commenting on the American version of the show.  She said they couldn't do the mirror room segment in America because no one would fit in it!  Yikes!  Has she looked in a mirror lately?  She isn't exactly thin herself.  I suppose it is their public persona to be witchy.  I wonder how she'd feel if someone said the Brits could all use some Crest whitening strips!  Get this book if you need help in deciding what best suits your body type. The right clothes can really make one feel better about him or herself.	2003-07-20

I really enjoy Ms. Dodd's writing and I finished this book in no time.  However, the main character, Hope, really \\"rubbed me the wrong way,\\" and was so close to being TSTL (to stupid to live).  So many things about her character made no sense to me:<br />a.  Although she said over and over and over that she was \\"a minister's daughter,\\" she had no qualms about her unprotected, premarital sex with a man she had only met a few days prior.  But, golly gee, she really wondered how was she going to make time for the relationship.<br />b.  I never remember her doing a lot to search for her siblings which was what her obsession was supposedly.<br />c. Hope was so annoying when she was spouting her political diabtribes such as: how Americans really know nothing about their own country/geography, much less that of the rest of the world, and how if they tried to learn more about the rest of the world we would be better off, blah, blah, blah.  This coming from a character who was trying to make her way to Texas, ended up poor in Ohio, and ends up going back to Boston.  Hello, why not buy a bus ticket to Texas instead of Mass.? Her comment about someone dying because they couldn't get cough syrup was really over the top.  If you are in such sad shape, I don't think Vicks Formula 44D is going to do you much good.<br />4.  And having lived in an orphanage you would think she'd be a little more street wise.  <br />Overall, I enjoyed this book, finding Zach's character making up for Hope's annoying tendencies.	2003-07-17

After reading Ms. Coulter's previous book I was compelled to get this one as well.  I enjoyed her arguments about how liberals have waged a battle against America and civilization and applaud her efforts.  I love her writing style which had me in stitches.  The lady has a biting wit and I'd hate to be on her bad side!  Overall, I think the book was well-written and her arguments are very convincing. It's funny how the truth makes the most sense. I am glad that Ms. Coulter's intelligence and commentary are reaching a broader audience and I am glad that she is a conservative.  She does us proud!	2003-06-27

After reading such a fun read like THEN COMES MARRIAGE I am now reading its prequel, FIRST COMES LOVE which is just as great.  The characters in this book were well-written and I loved the secondary ones as much as the primary ones.  Some of the scenes are laugh-aloud funny, i.e. the pumpkin patch scene.

I read this book based on the great review of it at allaboutromance.com, but was quite disapointed.  While I enjoyed Ms. Cabot's writing style and humor, I just didn't &quot;get&quot; the two main characters.  I never came to &quot;know&quot; or really care for them.  By the time they get together I could care less.  Also, the plot twists didn't make a lot of sense.  On a positive note, I did enjoy the sub-plot of the parents falling in love.  In fact, I enjoyed their story more.	2003-01-26

I read THE WEAVER TAKES A WIFE in just a few hours, mostly because I just couldn't put this delightful, charming book down.  There was a neat twist in that the hero was not an aristocrat and the heroine was quite the shrew.  However, I came to love them equally and felt that nothing was contrived.  The hero of the book, Ethan Brundy, reminds me a lot of Derek Craven of Lisa Kleypas' DREAMING OF YOU.  Except, Ethan keeps his charming Cockney accent and is all the more adorable.  If you are looking for a &quot;feel-good&quot; book with wonderful characters, this one is for you.	2003-01-19

Harlequin put out a line of books in the early 1990's called &quot;A Century of American Romance&quot; which had a story set in each decade.

The main characters of Drake and Lilah are over-the-top funny and definitely are at a battle of wills.  They think that their strong attraction to one another is something to be repressed and that their ideal mates must be submissive types.  They fight tooth and nail not to get together and seeing them fight the strong, undeniable attraction is hilarious.  It wasn't until the last page that I realized that there were no love scenes, yet I felt the characters passion much more than any more graphic stories I might have read recently.

I quickly e-mailed everyone on my e-mail list about this book.  My aunt couldn't believe it when she read my message.  She had read MRS. MIKE years and years ago in middle school and remembered everything about the book all this time later.  We talked for hours about it over the phone.  That weekend she went and purchased a copy for her daughter, who, of course, loved it as much as we did.  It may sound trite, but if I could only have two books, I would choose my bible and MRS.

I must admit that I was a bit skeptical about this book due to the fact that the heroine was older with children and the guy was an ex-cop.  I didn't want to read another book with unbelievable circumstances or ones with bratty, whiny kids.  But this book had everything one could possibly love about a romance novel: a sexy, wonderful hero; a realistic, loving, deserving heroine; and the secondary characters (especially the two daughters) were wonderful. This author is tops in writing scenes between family members.  I just loved everyone. There are some funny and touching scenes and the build-up of sexual tension between the two main characters sizzles and is definitely worth the wait.  What I loved the most about this book is that there were no sub-plots with mystery, intrique, etc.  While there is a dark side it is handled very responsibly and believably.  After writing this review, I have convinced myself to change my initial 4-star rating to 5.  It is beautifully-written book and I look so forward to tracking down this author's backlist.	2002-11-15

There was a lot of good writing here and a good story, but it got bogged down.  Personally, I would have liked some parts to have been shortened and others expanded upon.

If you are one of those romance readers who must have a dark, brooding tale, this book isn't for you.  However, if you like a light-hearted story with sexy, funny heroes this one is for you.  What I found especially unusual and refreshing about this book is that the characters had a past history and now years later they are pulled together again.  I loved the scenes from their previous times and wanted so much for them to get past their past and find the happiness they each deserved.  Patrick, the sexy, repentent rogue was so utterly charming that he stole the book.  His funny lines were the highlight of the novel for me.  If you need a lift or a change from more serious-minded books, this one is definitely a great pick.  As they say about acting, comedy is harder than drama and Jillian Hunter has proven her penchant for comedic characters without being flippant or silly.  I will definitely be reading this one again for Patrick's observations and comments alone.	2002-09-27

I am duly impressed with the short, concise way Ms. Beechick has explained the &quot;mystery&quot; of teaching the 3 R's to young children.  While educators would have us to believe that it is a secret, Ms. Beechick explains in short pamphlets no less how to do it and do it painlessly.  I especially like how in the arithmetic book, she describes what and how to teach a child in the first through third grades.  I am sure that now that I have begun teaching my son at home, I will use these little books quite often.	2002-08-28

Having read this book's sequel, DREAMING OF YOU, I fully expected to love THEN CAME YOU.  However, I am glad that I read the second book first for had I not, I probably never would have bothered to pick up DREAMING OF YOU.  Here are the problems that I just couldn't get passed in this book:  1.) How is it that Derek Craven (being the richest, most powerful man in England) couldn't find the daughter?  2.) Why didn't Lily borrow the money from her family?  I also had trouble believing that Derek wouldn't have lent the money to Lily.  It seems like to much of this plot was contrived.	2002-08-27

While this particular story had small problems I do not think that they distract from the main story which is quite enchanting.

Now that I am beginning to homeschool my son I am very happy that the book showed me the pitfalls of \\"sight-learning\\" of words. Even before I had a child I knew that if I ever did I would want them to learn to read with the phonics-method. What I did not remember was that the book had a reading primer in the back.

While I have read countless numbers of books on homeschooling and been given lots of advice on different curricula, etc. I never felt quite sure of myself or &quot;what method to use.&quot;  I first learned about this book in another book called HOMESCHOOLING FOR FREE.  I was intrigued by this method of short lessons with lots of subjects.  As a former high school teacher all of the advice seemed sound and full of common sense.  I now look forward to having the structure and the freedom that was lacking in other methods.  The focus on nature, short lessons, and classic literature are what attracted me to this method and I hope to one day read the original books by Charlotte Mason herself.  Until then, I thank this author for showing me the way.  Since reading about the Charlotte Mason method I have slept soundly knowing that I can school my son at home and do it well.	2002-07-29

Okay, okay, I realize that this is going to be one of those dividing books that one either loves or hates, and it being an SEP book, I thought my initial feelings would change.  Sorry, uh-huh, it still makes me cringe.  Besides the ickiness of Honey and Dash getting together (he had been her father-figure), I never really came to understand or care about the characters.  Yes, I saw all of the 5-star ratings calling this book emotionally-riveting, but I kept thinking how in need of a shrink all of the characters were! Yuck! Gross! Eeck!

The story is about Molly Sommerville, younger sister to Phoebe who is the owner of the Stars, and Kevin Tucker the present quarterback of the Stars.  Molly has striven to be a good girl but has a tendency to rebel and get into trouble.  Kevin, who grew up in a very religious home with older parents, struggles to make a lasting emotional connection.  Each character is very different from what they try to let people see.  After a rocky start, they end up finding love while working at a family campground that Kevin has inherited.  If you have read the other books in the series, you will be happy to know that Dan and Phoebe play a big role in this book.  What worked in this book:  the  beautiful setting, Molly's writings with Daphne the Rabbit and Benny the Badger being the alter egos of Molly and Kevin.  What didn't work: the story of Kevin's mom and the lack of spark between the two characters.  This book isn't HEAVEN, TEXAS, the best of the Chicago Stars books in my humble opinion, but it is an enjoyable read and a nice conclusion to the series.	2001-12-14

The plot seemed overly contrived with a desperate physicist setting out to get &quot;knocked-up&quot; by a dumb jock so that her baby would be &quot;normal.&quot; I thought the author used a lot of stereotypes about athletes and southerners even as she condemed her heroine for doing so.  For example, Cal, the quarterback was from my home state of N.C. Maybe, I'm being overly sensitive, but to prove that Cal really was smart and not a dumb hick, the author had him graduating from Michigan. SEP, ever heard of Duke or the Univ. of North Carolina?, two of the most prestigious colleges in the country. Although I found a lot of humor in this book and loved the characters of Annie and Lynn, (the secondary plot of Cal's parents was very touching) I couldn't get past how stupid Jane, the genius physicist, and Cal, were.  For two smarties, they acted really dumb.  I suppose this must have been an attempt at irony but it didn't work. And for someone who was so desperate to have a baby, I think there would have been more mention of her pregnancy along the way.  The actual labor and delivery was too unbelievable as well.  Don't doctors wash their hands before delivering a baby? And Cal chooses that moment to announce he wants to go to medical school.  Yes, I know I'd be thrilled to give birth and have my husband announce plans to be away.  Thanks, hon.  For me to enjoy a book, I have to respect the hero or heroine or they must redeem themselves.  Although, SEP tried, I never felt anything but contempt for both the main characters.  Yes, I know we must suspend our imaginations when reading romance, but when one is reading a contemporary, it helps if the plot is at least a little believable.  Maybe I am a bit jaded because SEP's previous book, HEAVEN, TEXAS just blew me away.  Although the characters were just as mismatched, the story was much believeable and the characters endearing.	2001-12-10

Maybe if I had read this particular one first I could have rated it at least 4 stars.  Unlike HEAVEN, I never felt a real spark between the two main characters, nor did I particularly ever come to like the hero.  The heroine was pleasant and I came to understand why she acted the way she did and truly came to care for her.  However, the hero, Dan, never really seemed like that great of a guy.  My heart didn't leap for joy when the two finally got together.  I kept thinking that Dan didn't deserve Phoebe.  Overall, it was a good book, but definitely not SEP's best.	2001-12-07

The premise of this funny, sexy, touching book is that an ex-pro football player, Bobby Tom Denton, is forced into retirement after a severe leg injury.  Seeking a new direction in his life he relunctantly signs-on to make an action movie back in his small Texas hometown (hence the title).  Out to find a new place in the world also is former nursing care-worker, Gracie Snow, who seeks a new start as a production assistant on the movie.  Unfortunately (or fortunately in the end) her first assignment is to make sure that the irreputable, charming B.T. gets to the set on time. They have quite an adventure along the way and become closer as both of them grow and change their past perceptions on love.  Ms. Phillips captures the hopes, dreams and emotions of the characters so beautifully that by the time the book ends you will have laughed, sighed and cried with Gracie and Bobby Tom, so much so that you'll be thinking of them fondly way after you finished the book. Bobby Tom Denton...(sigh)	2001-12-06

Having never given a book a one-star rating, I paused before doing so - but not for very long.  I thought that if I could find any redeeming value in the book, I could at least give it two stars.  My aunt had recommended this author, so I was eager to try one of her books.  Must have picked up the wrong one.  The story is about Dake, a native of Alabama, who fights for the Union during the war and then begins back home for the south after the war is over.  On the way, he finds the bodies of three people who were ambushed on a Kansas trail.  One of the victims is a white southern lady who is relieved because someone is there to save her newborn baby boy.  She tells him who she is and where she is from - Alabama.  After the woman dies, Dake   gathers up a quilt and the woman's bracelet so he'll have proof of the baby's identity.  He now is left with the arduous task of caring for a newborn and vows to return him to his family in Alabama.  Dake travels to the nearest cabin and ends up hiring its occupant, Cara, to travel with him to Alabama and take care of the baby.  With this premise, the story had a lot of promise.  But as soon as they arrive back in the south it becomes predictible and often insulting - the southerners are mean, evil and immoral and in need of Yanks to save them.  I struggled through the book hoping that I would find some of the excitement I had felt when I first began the book.  The characters never had a &quot;spark&quot; and a lot of the plot seemed contrived.	2001-12-03

I'm glad that I didn't read the other customer reviews before I read this wonderful book.  One reviewer actually called it tame.  Tame certainly is not a word I would use to describe it.  In fact, when I got to the peppermint scene I thought the pages would catch fire!  I haven't read the other books in this series (didn't even know there were others) and I hope to read them now.  I loved this book because of the wonderful writing style of Gaelen Foley's and for the wonderful character development, especially of Rafe.  I didn't really like him in the beginning and by the end he had completely redeemed himself.  The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because several of the scenes bothered me, such as Dani sitting on Rafe's lap during the council meeting.  However, the steamy love scenes are the best I've ever read in any book whatsoever.  I usually like my hero to be dark, but I take this blonde Adonis over a tortured, dark hero anyday.

Of course, she doesn't know until she reaches the farm that she has only won half.  The other half is owned by the unlucky gambler's older, gruff brother.  He thinks she has cheated her brother and treats her terribly.  I would have given this book 4 stars except for the fact that I never forgave Grant for his awful behavior towards Amanda.  He treats her shabbily even after taking her virginity which proved she wasn't the tramp he believed her to be.  The story line was fresh, I had never read about Kentucy horse farms before and learned a lot.  I liked Amanda, but Grant I could never forgive.	2001-10-23

What I found was that there was ton of potential here with this story, but it never developed.  We never learn really why Megan is so bent on marrying a titled gentleman, nothing except she has been snubbed, but that wasn't believable enough.

There aren't words to describe just how incredible he is.  And while Samantha takes a lot of criticism, I liked her.  I especially loved seeing a modern female who is actually excited about being a mom.  The whole &quot;Maxie&quot; plot was intriguing.

It took me a while to read HEARTBREAKER, but when I did I loved it.  I couldn't wait to get a hold of MERCY and it is even better!  I loved Theo and Michelle because they were kind, caring, loving people.  I loved the setting and the twist at the end (don't want to give away too much).  I got carried away with the story and came to love these characters.  A++++, job, Julie.	2001-09-24

Really loved the two previous Bridgerton books, especially THE VISCOUNT WHO LOVED ME.  I truly expected to love this newest book as well, but it just didn't seem to capture my heart as the other two did mainly because Benedict's character never really developed, I never felt that closeness to his character that I did with Simon and Anthony. By the time I read THE VISCOUNT WHO LOVED ME I already felt a kinship with Anthony and his brother Colin, but not with Benedict.  The sad part is I didn't feel any differently about Benedict when I read his book.   Also, I didn't quite buy the ending.  It seemed rushed and contrived, just too convenient.  I hope I don't sound too harsh, but I had to be honest in my review.  This is a good book, just not a great one.  The one spark of interest I got from this book is with Colin and Penelope.  I was so happy to see how she stood up to him and look forward to reading about them in JQ's next Bridgerton book coming out in Summer 2002.  .	2001-08-06

This was the second JQ book that I had read, the first being THE DUKE AND I. After reading this book I went on to read her newest book, AN OFFER FROM A GENTLEMAN.  Of the three, this is my absolute favorite.  I haven't been reading romance a long time, so I don't know if this book is following a &quot;formula&quot; or not as someone else's review noted.  I can only judge it on its own merit and therefore I say that it is wonderful.  I really identified with Kate and was happy to see that her beautiful sister Edwina wasn't portrayed as a monster.  When Kate and Anthony finally get together on their wedding night I had heart palpatations.  I had been rooting for them since the beginning and was so happy that they married.  The scene where he tells her how much he desires her made me melt!  I truly enjoyed this book and it is definitely in my keeper pile.	2001-08-06

I suppose I have been spoiled like many other JG fans by THE SECRET, RANSOM, and THE WEDDING to name a few of her 5+ star books.  I have read some of her other Regency books and have not enjoyed them as much as her Medieveal books.  For some reason, these books don't &quot;feel&quot; like Regency books if that makes any sense.  And I have to agree with some of the other reviewers in that if you read these particular Regency books close together it is difficult to tell the characters apart (freckles across the nose, etc.).  However, as I got into the story I did enjoy it.  I liked Caine and Jade very much, but call me a prude, but I do get turned off a story when the characters are sleeping together before they are married.  Overall, I think this is a good read, just not Ms. Garwood's best.	2001-07-22
US	45516106	R1IV0EX4ZYPT7G	1551667959	822589843	7b	Books	1	3	3	N	N	Did I miss something?	I love historical romance and was excited when I saw the back cover to this one.  This book is the first by Stella Cameron that I have read and may be the last.  Please tell me that the quote by Linda Lael Miller on the cover: &quot;Nobody does suspense and sensuality like Stella Cameron&quot; wasn't a joke!  I couldn't buy that a respectable woman in this time period would intentionally get pregnant without being married. I was also completely turned-off (read: &quot;grossed out&quot;) by the cucumber scene! Yuck!  All in all, if this were my first encounter with historical romance, I would never try another book.	2001-06-27

I am just drawn to the story and to the characters.  This novel was the first one I read by Julie Garwood and it prompted me to read many more.  I loved everything about the story, especially the characters.  They were all the kind you root for, even the secondary characters.  Both the hero and heroine had faults, but were both honorable and deserving of happiness and when they finally got together I had a great big smile on my face!  Definitely a great read and re-read.	2001-06-13

One of the problems with this book is that when I read it I expected it to be as great as its counterpart: TWIN OF ICE.  But it just isn't as good.  I finished reading it just to see more about the characters from the first book.  I suppose my biggest problem was that the heroine, Blair, slept with her sister's fiancee.  Also, I was upset that the hero actually didn't know the difference between the sisters!  Give me a break!  I never felt the same feelings I had for Kane and Houston.  Had the characters gotten together in a more honorable way, I could have possibly felt something for them.	2001-06-13

The drama was quite intense and the story had a lot of suspense to keep the pages turning.  However, I never felt the characters connect in the way I felt they should.  And there were too many loose ends that should have been wrapped-up.  I realize that maybe some of those loose ends will be explained in the next two books of this series, but I felt that the book just came to an abrupt stop without giving any indication as to why.  Overall, if you like tormented heroes this is a book for you.	2001-06-01
US	45516106	R1P6PE6D7ZMQD2	0671739719	24701162	Twin of Ice	Books	5	21	23	N	N	Kane &amp; Houston are adorable!	TWIN OF ICE is one of my all-time favorite books written by Jude Deveraux.  I find myself picking it up anytime I want to smile.  Kane is not your typical hero (but none of Jude's heroes are typical, are they?).  He is extremely wealthy with the manners of a pig.  But Houston makes him appear to be the great man he is inside.  And in return Kane brings out the fun-loving, spirited woman who is thought to be an ice princess by others.  The dialogue is hilariious and spirited.  Overall, it is defintely a keeper.	2001-05-07

This one was a good story, but in the end I was by no means blown away as I was with say, THE BLACK LYON or SWEET LIAR.  Most of the book dealt with how miserable each of the three main characters were in their lives.  I really wish that less would have been written about the old lives and more about the &quot;new&quot; ones.  I suppose what I missed the most is romance!  I will have to give this book four stars - because it was definitely better than LEGEND and HIGH TIDE.	2001-05-05

The setting was wonderful and I thought the story was well-paced.  The characters were well-developed.  I suppose the one aspect that kept getting under my skin was the whole labor vs. owner saga.  I thought it was a bit heavy-handed.	2001-05-02

I wasn't really expecting to like this book based on some of the other customer reviews I had read, but it was much better than I anticipated.  I agree with some of the other reviewers about their opinion of the heroine - she was just a little too vain. (And what in the world was the little sister all about? - she was creepy).  The most redeeming part of the book was Ring.  He was great.  I never saw him as the heroine did.  I thought everything he did was to protect her.  At least in the end everything worked out enough to leave me satisfied - unlike some other of Ms. Deveraux's books.	2001-05-02

It has been several weeks since I read this book and I still feel as if the characters are with me.  I loved this book and it is in my top 3 of Ms. Deveraux's works along with THE BLACK LYON and SWEET LIAR.  I loved the characters, the time setting, and especially the humor.  Who could forget the Carmen Miranda scene?  I also loved the scenes when they were at home in Florida.  If I ever could become a heroine in a book I would become Princess Aria.  I would give this more than 5 stars if possible.	2001-05-02
