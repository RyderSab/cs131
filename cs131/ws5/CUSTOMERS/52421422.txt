But don't expect anything else. The book's big grammar section is not useful at all. You have to be extemely patient to read through it. In addition to the small print, this section is confusing and badly organized. This book is definitely NOT handy for a quick grammar reference. <br />I would prefer that instead of cramming everything together publishers gave more space to the dictionary part, including more words and using a bigger print, and then may be inserted some  reference table (verbs, etc.) for people who have studied Spanish grammar before.<br />I think you should look around for similar items before settling on this one.	2002-02-07

Peter Freestone, a.k.a. Phoebe, was under too much pressure to write this book.  The result is a book, which is not as satisfactory as I imagined it would be.  This book IS a tell-all, coming from the man, who lived under  the same roof with FM for several years and have known him even longer.   What could be more telling than that?  It is a TELL-ALL, IN A GOOD SENCE OF  THE WORD. <br />I must admit that I laughed my head off, during some  particular recollections. The funniest thing is the  &quot;CASTING-LIST&quot; AT THE BEGINNING AND AT THE END OF THE BOOK. It  lists many people first, as they were when FM used to know them, and then,  as they are now, ten years after his death. <br />Despite the humor, wit, and  certain depth, this book IS NOT A MUST-READ, because much of the  information has already been discussed in previous books about FM.  I know  that all of you fans out-there will read it anyway, so why do I even bother  persuading you to do otherwise?  Well... because this book left me with  some strange and very sad feeling...not about Freddie Mercury, but about  Mr. Freestone himself. I can't help thinking that he suffered the loss of  FM more than he cares to admit, because he devoted too much of his own life  to FM, in a sence...  <br />Mr. Freestone seems to be a wonderful man, [the  most] decent person in music biz, and above all-- the kind of a friend that  anyone of us could wish for.  I hope that his book would be the last one  about Freddie Mercury, unless musicologists and professional biographers  decide to conduct serious research of FM's art and life.	2000-06-10

The author did not answer his own question... Whatever happened to Scott after he stopped acting? Why was he so reclusive and so on? The author himself does not know. <br />The author testifies that his father was wonderful and dignified man, but what would most people write about their fathers? It seems that the son was quite distant from his father, because it was in his father's nature to be distant from everyone and everything.<br />C.H. Scott is preoccupied with one thing only in this book: refuting rumor about his father and Cary Grant. I sympathize with the author.  But if he meant to fight against &quot;the slander&quot;, then he fails. Instead of being factual and objective in his refute, he just keeps coming back to the issue with his childish arguments. As the result this book is THE MOST BORING READ ever!!!  <br />The author talks about his own life too much. If this book was titled: &quot;Me and My Dad, Randolph Scott&quot;, it would have been appropriate. There aren't even any good photos, except for &quot;the young George Randolph Scott in his family house&quot;. The author should have taken a lesson from his father: When you have nothing to say, DON'T SAY ANYTHING!	2000-06-09

However, this book	would be interesting only to people, who study scripts seriously, who love Minghella's art, and who love the film itself.  This particular script was not meant to stand on its own, unlike some scripts from other great films.  It was only meant to be Minghella's subjective and brief overview of what  he is going to create for the screen. I  bought it because I was curious to  compare written word with what I have seen on the film.

He does not scare the reader away; he does not sound like &quot;the all-knowing, arrogant Hollywood pro&quot;. He is trying to be helpful and more or less encouraging. Yet, he does talk  about how things are in Hollywood realistically.  He does want you, the  reader, to take his advice and to try Hollywood out with his help.

It really is one of those books, that you  have to refer over and over again, while you are in a process of writing.    Also, the author does not give much info about how to market/sell your  work; he only points out quite obvious things and general directions in  regard to the subject.

However, it makes [unintentionally] one excellent point about actors: Brad Davis' life and career show that not only women are treated as  &quot;piece of meat&quot; in Hollywood; it also applies to men, who happen  to be handsome, sexy, etc. Looks can help actors' career and they can also  destroy it, if actors are not allowed &quot;out of their stereotypes&quot;  or if they become too impressed with themselves.  Maybe Davis was not  handsome per se, but there was an undeniable and irresistible  sensuality/mystery about him. You can almost feel it, watching his films  and looking at the photos.  Davis' wife stayed with him, despite of all the  hell he put her through, because she had always been desperately in love  with him. And now she is still angry. She testifies in the book that Davis  was self-destructive, unstable, and careless person, who was a hustler in  his young days and later spent many nights on the town, &quot;cruising and  boozing&quot;. Yet, she is still afraid to admit who he really was. Why  write this book, then? This book is very depressing and certainly is very  uninspiring to AIDS-affected people, their families, gay people, and even  young actors, who are starting in the business. I feel for Susan Bluestein  as a woman, who chose a difficult life and a difficult love, but she does  not seem to be a person, who knew Davis best. May be there is somebody  else, or may be noone could ever really know him...In any case, Davis's  made an important contribution to the world of cinema.	2000-05-21

Plus, endless cooking and recipes just irritated my  stomach, so I did not find it romantic at all (as it is supposed to be).

Yes, it is another story about unimaginable suffering  of out-cast Indians, The Untouchables. Yes, if you call yourself a HUMAN  being and have a heart, you WILL empathize with them.  However, this book  doesn't ask you to pitty its characters and/or cry for them. Instead, it  makes you think about them, not only in the context of Indian culture, but  in a context of a much larger world. It also forces you to draw parallels  to your own culture, whether you like it or not.  Today, this book is  especially potent, as we no longer live in our &quot;little isolated  cultures&quot;, separated by endless preconceptions and stupid prejudices  about each other.  In addition, this book is simply a piece of excellent  writing, thanks to the wonderful writing skills and creative methods of its  author. The story is narrated through the eyes of a main character, who  directly addresses you as a reader, and yet sometimes seems to ignore you  completely, while going about his own business (those are particularly  interesting moments in the story). So, read this book, follow the lives  (actually, try to live their lives with them) of its numerous and vivid  characters, not one of whom is like the next one. I garantee that you will  learn something new about India and also about yourselves, in the process  of reading this book.	2000-03-31

I was reading this book in college cafeteria...I laughed so hard, that I can't imagine what people around me must have thought. But, who cares? The main thing is that this book is hillarious and very powerful, at the same  time.  I have always realized that TV Nanny character was largely based on  Dreshcher's own personality. However, I had no idea that the real Nanny  (i.e. Drescher herself) was such a talented  writer, strong person, and  much less &quot;annoying&quot; (meaning her whining) woman.  As I said this  book is absolutely funny (it also has the funniest pictures that people  could ever take of themselves, too), yet it is not all just  fun... As  Drescher shares her most personal experiences with the readers, she also  makes you think about life, family, and the &quot;glamor of  Hollywood&quot;. I recommend this book to absolutely everyone (even if you  are not Dresher's biggest fan...I, most certainly, was not).  TO SUMMARIZE:  This book reads like a high-class comical fiction, yet it is ablsotutely  true and about a real person.  Dresher's writing style is simply  wonderful!	2000-03-27

An honest and intersting look at a true STAR	Being very good at what he does, Donald Spoto, manages to provide readers with an accurate, in depth, and yet entertaining look at the life of Elizabeth Taylor, both on and off screen.  Naturally, he starts with the  early childhood, because at the age of nine Taylor was already bona fide  child-actor.  Then, as a heroine, i.e. Talyor, grows up, the discussion  focuses mainly on men in her life, her first love (Monty Cliff) and her  first marriage...and then, another marriage... and then another marriage,  and another... It is hard to keep track at times! However, Spoto also shows  Taylor's ability to stay true to her friends, inspite of many-many traumas  and ugly gossips that have always surrounded her public persona.  The only  downside of this book is that narration stops somehere in a  &quot;Taylor/Jackson&quot; period.  Since Spoto already opened up a candid  discussion of Taylor's health and other life problems, I think readers  would like to know more about the on-going life battles, that their  favorite female star presently has to fight. Also, it would be nice, if he  mentioned Taylor's contribution to the fight with AIDS more extensively. In  other words, Spoto should be planning on another revised edition of this  otherwise lovely book.	2000-03-26

Many of them are very good, but this particular book is still the best for couple of reasons. First of all, it is a 100%  autobiography, written by one of the most amazing, and not just most  beautiful, women in the world. Loren's character is reflected on every  page, as she narrates her life, starting with her family background all the  way to talking about her own children. Secondly, she writes with candor  that would surely shock a reader, who is used to reading polished and often  pretentious autobiographies of Hollywood stars.  Loren, the writer, does  not shy away from admitting to being the uggliest girl in town, while  growing up; to feeling such human emotions as rage, fear, jealousy, hate at  various stages of her life...Yet, after you finish reading this book, you  will be amazed at the fact that Loren's greatest emotions have invariably  been that of a compassionate, forgiving, and loving woman.	2000-03-25

I had to buy this book for my Asian literature class at the university. But when the quarter had come to its end, I did not want to sell it (which is what I do with so many other books). This book took my breath away,  while I was reading it for the first time, and it still does, because I  re-read it at least once a month. If I don't have time to read it all or  when I feel down, I just open up any passage at random and read couple of  sentences. The beauty of River Sutra is very much in the hands of its  author, Gita Mehta, I must say. I have read many books about India (books,  where India has been a subject of a fiction, as it is in this case), but  River Sutra is not just another book that shows India in a hopelessly  romantic way. At first, it may seem as such, because the author does employ  magical realism and romanticism in her work. However, if you read it more  than once, you will start feeling the power of the narration in a  completely different way... You will realize that it is not JUST A ROMANTIC  FICTION about oh-so-romantic country... For me, reading this book, in  itself, sounds like a mantra (subject, touched on in the book, by the way).  Stylistically, Mehta rises to the level of incomparable &quot;1000 and 1  nights&quot; and I have not seen too many contemporary Eastern authors  being able to do that. But, what's even more amazing is, that she also  manages to bring her work to a modern and a very universal perspective. I  hope Mehta keeps writing, and I also hope that one day I have a full  collection of her works!	2000-03-25

Nowadays, everyone seems to write biographies, but not everyone succeeds.

After I have finished reading it, I was not disappointed with him as a man. This book is an accurate, though modest, description of  Washington's life up-to-date (1994-1996). It tells about his childhood,  youth, and his family background. Then, the author goes into tracing  Washington's life according to the films, he has been making at the time.  This book does not have a lot of good pictures and it is  not about a  &quot;Hollywood Hunk&quot;, &quot;the most handsome man&quot;, etc.   Instead, it talks about a real man, who is very good at acting as well as  at living his life of a Hollywood star. If you like Washigton as an actor  and as a personality (granted, he is also an undisputedly and exremely  charming man), then you should read this book and see how he became what he  is now.	2000-03-25

Books	1	85	100	N	N	1's too good;even an utter idiot wouldn't find it delightful	I totally agree with previous reviewer on all points. (I could not bring myself to rating this DISGUSTING GARBAGE, I mean 1 is too good for it! )  Let me just re-state those points... Firstly, please, pay attention that  all of the men mentioned in this book are already dead. Secondly, I do  believe that all of the men mentioned in the book were &quot;more or less  gay&quot; (and I do not mean bisexual...I mean those men, who ARE GAY, but  can't fully admit it, even to themselves). However, I DO NOT SEE how and  why would they be so frank with this pompous tiny man... Tony Perkins, for  example, was never known for his good demeanor, especially towadrs  journalists.  Thirdly, author's complete lack of a writer's imagination is  obvious, because ASOLUTELY ALL MEN SOUND ALIKE (now, who in their sound  state of  mind would believe that Tony Perkins, Cary Grant, James Coco, and  say Liberace were so much alike in their personal manner of speaking and  their opinions on various subjects? ) IT IS ABSURD. Last but not least,  throughout all of the so-called conversations, the author keeps  interrupting people that he is &quot;conversing&quot; with, just to show  how smart he is or to insert yet another sleazy piece of gossip. Had he  really done that, I believe, he would have been immediately shut off, if  not by Cary Grant, then definitely by Tony Perkins, for doing that.   However,  the bit about 80-year-old Cary Grant putting moves on the author  absolutely takes the cake among all other absurd and disgusting  insinuations, I have read so far about gay men in Hollywood. After all that  Grant had lived and seen, I am sure  he would have had much better taste in  men, if in nothing else... Anyway, this book is worst than any of today's  tabloid rubbish. Therefore, I have two questions...Firstly, Why on earth   anyone would want to publish that?(Answer: For money, of course, and that  is sad... sad that we, as readers, get to read it). Secondly, is it even  possible (apparently, it is! ) for the author to claim that such intimate  conversations supposedly happened in the first place, and, then, to publish  them (breaking, again, the supposed confidentiality) without any  authorization from people mentioned and without any legal repercussions  from the &quot;victims&quot; side? But, then again, those men are dead, so  the garbage just keeps coming our way...	2000-03-25

YES, the author lacks high writing skills. YES, the book is lame and very tabloid-ish. YES, most of the presented facts are questionable. HOWEVER, when I'd read this book in 1993-early 1994, it was the first book about FM,  I have ever read. Today, there are many more books about him on the market  and much better ones, too. BUT, I did not read this book as a DEFINITIVE  BIOGRAPHY of a great personality, THAT IS WHY I was able to enjoy it... ALL  IN ALL, there are plenty of funny (as always) quotes from FM (true or  not...&quot;Who cares, darling?&quot; as the Man himself would probably  say), as well as other funny anecdotes from people around him.	2000-03-25
US	52421422	R1HFIV3BBKXW9X	0747521344	546424572	Mercury and Me	Books	5	80	89	N	N	People call it &quot;cheesy&quot;, but it should be BACK IN PRINT	After I have read this book, I was angry with people, who either dismissed this book as Jim Huttons's weepy-cheesy attempt to make a quick buck from FM's death, or who ran Hutton down for &quot;breaking  confidentiality&quot;, by telling the TRUTH in this book. Both of those  groups of poeple are COMPELETELY WRONG. Firstly, I, too, found this book a  bit weepy in style, but later I realized that it was through no fault of  Hutton's, but rather book's editor (Tim Wapshott, if my memory serves my  right, who has a general tendency towards &quot;over-dramatizing&quot;  things).  Publishers, no doubt, also wanted a weepier version, so that  people would be willing to buy a book from an unknown man. As for Hutton's  atttempt to make money, let me remind you that while FM was alive nobody  (public and fans) ever knew, who FM's &quot;husband&quot; was, much less  his name...Hutton did not flash in front of the cameras (unlike some lovers  of today's celebrities). So, it is unfair to say that Hutton tried to  profit with this book. Instead, this book should be seen as his attempt to  channel his grief towadrs something positive and to express his own  feeings. I, personally, thank him for this book.  Obviously, being an  honest person, he did not idealize FM in his memories and THAT IS WHAT I  LIKED BEST! . Let's also not forget that Hutton himself is affected with  HIV, so it is good that we have this book to read, before it is too late.  Secondly, people, who were offended by this book's intimate details,  well... SORRY, but this is who FM was... not some angel, but a real person  with his ups and downs, 100% gay man, who lived with another man, died from  a painful decease, and had other things to think about (his past, his  relation to God, his family, his loved ones) than his fans or press, while  he was sick.  I was especially touched by the last part of the book, where  Hutton says something like.... &quot;/for lovers/ not to waste time on  stupid arguments and misunderstandings, because the day will come and it is  gonna be too late...instead, just listen to your hearts, etc.&quot;  I  think it is a beautiful message, and that we could all learn something from  Hutton/FM example.	2000-03-25

He was the first man to work on  all of the problems and issues, unresolved by other known sciences at the time ( in 19-century), to combine many of the already known scientific methods in one, and  to call it sociology. Surely,  there were other theorists, his contemporaries, who were starting to wander  in the same direction at the same time with Durkheim, but he was the one,  who put his own and other people's theories to practice. That is what  &quot;Suicide&quot; is all about: gathering data and putting it to test  with the theory (suicide, being the subject of the study in this case, of  course).  The best part about Durkheim's work presented in  &quot;Suicide&quot; is that it is still an incredibly potent and  groundbreaking manuscript. One, who reads it today, can't help but notice  that human nature and human problems have largely remained the same: they  are universal and ageless and they still need to be studied by competent  sociologists.	2000-03-25

I am very glad that I did, because I have discovered a talented writer, of whom I knew nothing before. Some people, who were very impressed  by the film, might have found the book less satisfying, because of some  plot differences between the two. These differences doubled the pleasure  for me, personally. Both men, Anthony Mighhella and Michael Ondaatje, are  absoltutely genious and it is nice to have the same fantastic story told  twice from a slightly different perspective.  Bravo to both men!	2000-03-25

Anyway, it is a nice book, that  covers basic concepts of Kundalini in a hutshell. It is orientated towards  an average(western) reader, who knows nothing about it. It  talks mainly  about the &quot;eros&quot; part (for whose, who are looking for  something  &quot;juicy&quot;, you won't find it here). Downside: The book does not  have too many practical exercises and the pictures are not very helpful.  SO, if you want some theory on the subject with couple of illustrations,  this book is OK. However, if you are serious about practicing Kundalini, it  won't be much help.	2000-03-24

It is not very balanced: it either gives very basic info (the info you would rather get from your local instructor or library), or it  goes too deeply into examples.

It covers both trad. and non-trad. methods of  control. It has a few charts (medications, etc.) and aslo a few useful  addresses of organizations, who help people suffering from epilepsy.

This book is not a distasteful one unlike a vast majority of books about gays in Hollywood. It is also quite entertaining and should be regarded only as such: an entertaining book on a summer's day... In this  case it does not really matter, whether the material is credible or not.

All  reviews cry about how brilliant this book is, and this and that... and   IT IS NOTHING OF A SORT! It is hugely OVERRATED!

This is a fantastic book, if you need to read a real and thorough biography about Howard Hughes. I mean, it is so thorough, that you can find anything you possibly want to know (if you study HH as a scholarly subject or just curious)... you can find anything, but the speculations about his  private life. This book is not about speculations, it is a REAL RESEARCH.  It is done chronologically and it has many appendices, that discuss  everything, from significant dates in HH's life to the financial statements  of his company and his finances throughout his life. I, personally, don't  have any warm feelings towards the character of HH as a historical figure  (quite to the contrary...as a matter of fact I dislike him), but the  authors of this book deserve all the praise, they can possibly get.	2000-03-24

I had to read this book as  a part of my Social Theory class. I did not find this book interesting (much less relevant to the real life...unlike works of Emile Durkheim, &quot;Father of Sociology&quot;, that are still powerful and fascinating read).

It is a  religion- based (namely, Christian religion) point of view... and you can guess for yourselves, which one it would be. I liked this book, nonetheless, because  being interested in the subject, I opened up my mind to every kind of   perspective.

I have read quite a few books about Oscar Wilde, both biographical and fictional. But, I must say that &quot;Judas Kiss&quot;, written by a very talented David Hare, seems to be the best among the plays.  The minute I started reading this book, I felt better about not having a chance to see  the play on Broadway, with an incredible Liam Neeson as late Oscar Wilde.  Hare's playwriting ability is so powerful, that I was able to re-create  theater stage, the story happening on it, and even Liam Neeson himself. In  terms of its narrrative, &quot;Judas Kiss&quot; takes somewhat  non-traditional look at the last few months of Oscar Wilde's life in Italy.  It is well-documented that prison changed him greatly in spirit and in  body, and that he came out physically and spiritually weaker than ever.  But, wait and see what Hare has to say about this as well as about Bosie's  presence in Wilde's life after prison, among other things.	2000-03-24

It is quite insightful, but as a reference book it lacks n easy-to-use format. Also, it does not list some of the good schools, that I found out about from another  sources (movie magazines and internet). Overall, it is not worth spending  $11-14 on... $4-5?

It is a good read for anyone, who is seriously interested in a &quot;star phenomenon&quot; in particular, and &quot;Hollywood phenomenon&quot; in  general. Step by step, Dyer focuses on topics such as &quot;stars as a  social phenomenon&quot;, &quot;stars as images&quot;, and &quot;stars as  characters in films&quot;.   He supports his findings with numeorus  examples of many different films and actors, such as Al Pacino, Malylin  Monroe, Tipi Hedren, etc.  He also mentiones Jane Fonda in depth as an  illustration of a specific image construction in Hollywood.  One can only  hope that in his upcoming edition, Dyer will expand his study to include  examples of contemporary stars, since Hollywood dynamics keeps changing  drastically every decade or two.	2000-03-24

This play seems to be true to Oscar Wilde's real biographical story in terms of its dialogues, but I did not enjoy reading it much. At first, I thought to myself: &quot;Well, it is a PLAY, after all, may be it will seem better on a theater stage, where it belongs&quot;. So, I went to see three  different versions in three different theaters. I am sorry to say, but I  did not feel much better about this play after doing that.

Its format follows all the necessary rules: it is small and it is easy to use. This book covers every basic issue, that may arise before you live to UK or after you have already arrived there.  Every topic (e.g. immigration  requirements, banking, health, shopping and so on) discussed briefly, yet  so precisely, that it will take you only a few munites to refresh your  memory on the matter. It has three apendices that list all of the UK's  higher education institutions by classification, all of the youth  organizations you need to know about, and also many youth hostels and other  types of  affordable accommodation throughout UK.  Last, but not least,  this book even has a London subway map (more appropriately,  &quot;underground&quot; or simply &quot;the tube&quot; as Londoners call  their beloved type of public transportation) printed on the first page. So,  put this book in your pocket, buy an airline ticket and you are ready for  your trip to gool old London, whether you plan to study, live, or simply  travel there.	2000-03-24

I imagine that other editions (hardcover and so on) are extremely expensive, so this book is a good introduction into the works of a classic and exceptionally talented writer.  I have read much of Pushkin in Russian language, so I can honestly say that  this book is true to the originals and it is worth spending your $3 on.  NOTE: To people, who know that Pushkin is considered greatest RUSSIAN  (emphasis on &quot;russian&quot;) writer and expect to find real Russia in  his writings: you won't find much of it here, for the fact that Pushkin  wrote mainly about his upper-class contemporaries, who (pretty much like  Pushkin himself) lost touch with real Russia, hence the revolution awhile  later... If you want to feel some of Pushkin's russian spirit, you should  try reading his poetry instead of the short stories.	2000-03-24

This book is a complete absurd... It is nothing more than another attempt to cash-in on George Michael's recent situation by the people, who profit from gossips and heinous stories in the first place. This book is not  official and using GM's name as one of the authors is simply criminal. Yes,  it is a collection of quotes made by GM at various times, but... taken out  of the content, they aim to work as yet another illustation of a weak and  stupid pop-star, WHICH HE IS NOT. I believe that tabloid biz is the worst  way (even prostitutes sell their own bodies as oppose to selling stories  about other peoples' bodies) to make a living (and what a good living it  must be), that is why I do not EVER buy tabloids.

I enjoyed reading this book.  I knew nothing  about William Haines's life...And this book tells an interesting story without getting into unnecessary &quot;juicy details&quot;, that fill up  many other gay people's bios, regardless of whether  they are true or not.  Nowadays, many authors seem to think that its their duty to write A LOT  about sex and to insert every gossip imaginable into every single chapter  of their books, when it comes to writing about gay people. I am grateful to  Mann for not doing that. Of course, he gives us a fair share of &quot;gay  insights&quot; and &quot;outtings&quot; (whether they are true or not,  again, it is hard to tell, but none of them is distasteful.  He also can  not resist the temptation of sounding somewhat &quot;prophetic&quot; and  judgemental  about gay actors, just like so many other authors do. It is  especially obvious, when Mann talkes about Cary Grant. (BY THE WAY, the  book says very little about Cary Grant directly in relation to Willaim  HAINES, as one of the critics claimed it does). I mean, we do not really  get to hear what Haines had to say about Cary Grant ( and about many of his  so-called friends, for that matter...). THIS IS WHAT I DID NOT LIKE ABOUT  THIS BOOK. I realize, that it is a bio, not an autobio, but still...If  there was not enough credible material about others, why mention them at  all? Why not just talk about the main man, Haines? He seems to have been an  interesting enough subject to fill three bio book, not just one. Anyway,  despite minor shortcomings, this BOOK IS TASTEFULLY WRITTEN, and that in  itself, is an achievement among the endless stream of rubbish that is  published today.	2000-03-23

First of,  I must confess that I am prejudiced about this book, because the author, honorable Dr. Robert Carbaugh, was my economics Professor at the University.  But, seriously now, I was not an economics major  and I  also was not a very good student, meaning I missed far too many  classes...But, whenever I sat down to read the book, it was very easy to  catch up with the rest of the class. In fact, even if you are not a student  at all, but just interested in the basics of international economics, you  would still find this book very useful.  I took four other economics  classes and all of them were boring, mainly because of the teachers'  inability to teach well. This  book, however, is a  reflection of a  good-natured, quick witted, and highly intelligent economist, who TEACHES  REAL STUFF EVERY DAY to the average university students and manages to keep  their attention. It's a hell of a job to do that HERE, I tell you!	2000-03-23

I guess, it isespecially difficult to write about him, because when he died, he did not leave an autobiography or, at least, some decent interviews.  It seems like he rarely answered questions seriously and did not really like talking to the press.  Nevertheless, everyone familar with Queen, must know that he was, indeed, &quot;living on the edge&quot; in all respects. So, this book does not say anything new or anything coherent. It lacks purpose, strength, and accuracy that should be present, when writing about such enormous genius like Freddie Mercury. Listening to his music, his own statements (however rare), and his jokes still beats reading lame bios about him.	1999-11-14
