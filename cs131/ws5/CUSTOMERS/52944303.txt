(American Intellectual Culture)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Better than I expected	Hats off to author Tevi Troy, who has offered a surprisingly interesting and enjoyable read about how White House administrations joined intellectualism and politics.  Instead of being a boring, blow-by-blow account of just one aspect of presidential goings on, \\"Intellectuals and the American Presidency\\" provided an educational angle that taught me how presidents utilize specialized personnel to provide political advice, manage ideas, court the intellectual community, and even act as a political lighting rod.  No matter how much you know about the administrations from JFK to George W., I would recommend this book to add another layer to anyone's understanding of recent presidential history. <br /> <br />Although I wouldn't categorize this book as a \\"page turner,\\" I still found myself sticking with it a lot longer in an attempt to retain continuity within chapters.  In addition to providing lots of insight into some very interesting political thinkers, Mr. Troy also compares the differences in how intellectual roles were modeled from one administration to the next.  One example:  after Lyndon Johnson's administration, a shift occurred whereby the intellectual community began to garner representation from the right (neo-conservatives); however, under Nixon, this representation came from one who was decidedly more liberal on numerous issues, namely, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.   <br /> <br />The author is very fair in his perception of those presidents who had effective relations with the intellectual community (e.g., Kennedy, Clinton), those who lacked intellectual guidance (e.g., Carter, Ford), and those who used intellectuals not to formulate policy, but to carry forth presidential viewpoints into the mainstream media and populace (e.g., Reagan, Bush II).  Mr. Troy remains nonpartisan throughout, as he considers the motivation and style of each president, and relates these to both the successes and failures of policy and persona throughout each of the administrations.There's even an excellent chapter about the interaction between candidates Bush and Gore, and how their actions and speeches were interpreted by the media during the 2000 presidential campaign. <br /> <br />Due to the specialized focus of the subject matter, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to everyone, but it would be an excellent read for students of political science, or perhaps those of us who want to reflect more about the memories of presidential administrations from the 60's to the 90's. <br />	2004-12-17

Every image in this book is a sight to behold, combining the beauty and grace of the human body with the imagination and emotion brought forth by an underwater stage.    Photographer Howard Schatz has advanced beyond \\"Water Dance\\" to perfect his art of underwater photography through a more effective use of the pool's characteristics to portray motion, suspend animation, and produce some of the most fantastic images of the human body.  Every one of the 120+ photos is worth a long look.  The bodies of the dancers, models and swimmers are not all there is to admire, but take a look at how Mr. Schatz uses the surface of the pool as a mirror or as a screen to either reflect or shield portions of the physique.  Every aspect of each image seems to be perfectly in place, even air bubbles and ripples of the pool's surface, which add an interesting quality of depth and lighting.    As a nice complement to the images, there are several pages of commentary which describe the artists' (photographer, collaborators and models) inspiration and efforts, as well as some of what goes into making a book like this.  For example, it's noted how Mr. Schatz prepares his \\"liquid studio\\" to be more tolerable to the subjects, such as using ozonated (not chlorinated) water, and matching the pool's pH balance to that of human tears so that models can keep their eyes open longer.  Interesting reading indeed.    \\"Pool Light\\" is one of my favorite photography books of all time, and I would recommend it to anyone.	2004-11-01

Though I see that many readers found this book to be fantastic, the 2-star rating reflects my tastes as well as my caution to those who may be taken aback by explicit nude photographs. <br /> <br />As an admirer of fine photography of the human form, I'm spoiled by artists such as Newton, Schatz, Demarchelier and Bensimon, to name a few, who take such beautiful photos of the female figure that almost anyone would marvel over them.  In \\"Crazy Babe,\\" photographer Bob Coulter has put together a collection of images that, while having some artistic merit, have left the realm of creativity/originality and are knocking at the door of pornography (not all, but most of them). <br /> <br />Fifteen different models are portrayed in approximately 350 photos (all digital, I believe).  Each image is the size of a large postcard, one per page.  The photographic quality is excellent:  sharp exposure, good lighting and vibrant color.  The book is also put together well in terms of paper quality and binding.  Some images were decently constructed; however, far too many were taken either from an odd angle or too close up,  which resulted in a distorted perspective.  As for the majority of photos, which were autoerotic or just plain in-your-face, one could take it or leave it. <br /> <br />For me, the overall vibe from \\"Crazy Babe\\" was not positive.  Though these \\"babes\\" may be both crazy and nude, I didn't consider many of their pictures attractive or alluring.  Much more beautiful (and artistic) photos of nude women can easily be found elsewhere	2004-11-01

This discussion is a perfect foreword to Mr. Schatz's work, in that having dancers \\"perform\\" underwater essentially solves the gravity problem.  What you see in \\"Water Dance\\" is a collaboration between photographer, dancer, choreographer and even costume designers to produce a sort of ballet that is weightless . . . underwater.  Virtually all of the subjects are dancers from the San Francisco Ballet and other companies, recruited by Mr. Schatz to perform in this project that uses a pool as a stage.  Each image is entitled \\"Underwater Study #...\\" and features usually one, but occasionally two or more dancers, captured in the midst of an expressive movement or pose, but suspended in a way that the fluidity is still present.  An interesting attribute to these photos is the use of the surface of the pool as a mirror, or as a plane through which a portion of the body can penetrate to become hidden.  Note also the use of special chiffon fabrics which were created for the underwater studies to take a shape which complements the dancers. <br /> <br />You don't have to be a fan of dance or photography to appreciate this book.  The images are truly amazing, and I believe anyone will find fascination with these photos. <br />	2004-09-15
US	52944303	RGSQ3AW70LLMC	1865085421	412285710	Tutu	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Tiny format detracts from very good ballet photography	I have always been one to believe that photographers who specialize in capturing the grace of the human body and ballet dancers can collaborate to produce the most sensational photographic images.  The photos in \\"Tutu,\\" by Australian photographer Greg Barrett, are very good at depicting the artistry of dance and the beauty of the ballet body, but there is one glaring drawback:  the smallness of the images nearly kills the impact of both the artistic technique and the beauty of the dancer's form.  My decision to give this a 3-star rating is due solely to my dissatisfaction with the published product, not with its artistic content.    I find no fault whatsoever with Mr. Barrett's methodology for highlighting a dance company's (all the subjects are members of The Australian Ballet) grace and talent through photography.  In his words from the introductory Monologue, the photographer recounts:  \\"One lens.  The same lighting all the way through.  Minimal props.  No trampolines.  No manipulation of the images.\\"  The result is nearly 150 b/w photos of dancers in amazing positions, some as if frozen in mid-air.  Lois Greenfield (\\"Breaking Bounds\\") mastered this imagery in the early 1980's with great results.  The dancers (a small percentage nude or semi-nude) are great at revealing their expertise at physical expression.  The images are very good, and they show vitality although, from a strictly technical standpoint, the photographic quality could have been better (Mr. Barrett admits that he \\"couldn't [have used] a much worse camera for shooting dance photography.\\"  Still, each and every photo in \\"Tutu\\" is worth a look.    My only major criticism is that this collection of photos does not do justice to the dance imagery because they are simply way too small.  The book's pages measure about 6\\" x 7\\", which results in some of the images being tiny, barely 2\\" x 2\\" in some cases.  In comparison to the works of others (Greenfield and Howard Schatz come to mind), this book left mefrustrated and longing for the impact I got from similarly-themed works by other photographers.    Believe me, these are good photos.  But, given the talent of everyone involved in this collaboration, a larger presentation would have produced a book definitely worthy of more than three stars.	2004-09-12
US	52944303	R22HV54A2SJC1A	0893818739	973422764	Stillpoint: Dance Photographs by Ronald Compton	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Not great, but pretty good studio dance photography	\\"Stillpoint\\" is a decent collection of dance photographs by Ronald Compton which highlights members of the Hartford Ballet.  Mr. Compton, a former executive of insurance giant Aetna (headquartered in Hartford), portrays his love of ballet and photography through an approach that incorporates a variety of depictions to bring out the beauty and vitality of the dancers. <br /> <br />What I liked most about this book is that Mr. Compton employed a variety of techniques and formats to present the beauty of ballet and the dancers' bodies.  Out of 70+ images, a little under half are in color.  The framing ranges from facial close-ups to head-to-toe shots of partnering scenes.  Some photos are posed, while others snatch the dancer out of mid-air in a style reminiscent of Lois Greenfield (\\"Breaking Bounds\\").  While some of the dancers are nude, others are in full costume (as from a full-length ballet).  Even the image quality was varied, from quite sharp to excessively grainy.  All the photos are taken in a studio (i.e., none from performances). <br /> <br />On the downside, this book is lacking certain ingredients which make a dance photography book truly impressive.  The attitude of the dancers, posed or otherwise, is sometimes missing a dimension that, for example, Greenfield and Greg Barrett (\\"Tutu\\") are able to achieve by freezing their subjects at the peak moment of raw energy and/or graceful movement.  Howard Schatz, the best at photographing the human body (absolutely superb), is adept at making a dancer jump off the page through his masterful use of lighting, resolution and positioning to show the body as a thing of sheer beauty.  Unfortunately, too many of the photos in \\"Stillpoint\\" are a trifle flat, meaning that there is a lack of contrast, or that the dancers too easily blend into a busy backdrop.  The result is that a number of images are short of presence or devoid of anything that will make the viewer look long at them. <br /> <br />The book is almost coffeetable size, and is printed on high-quality paper.  There's an interesting interview with Mr. Compton and the publisher's (Aperture) rep in the beginning.  Overall, this book is worth checking out by anyone who wants to become familiar with Mr. Compton's work, or who simply likes ballet photography. <br />	2004-09-12

For me, it's too easy to keep flipping pages and forget about how much time is going by.  Anyone who likes trivia of a historical, scientific, religious, or geographical nature (to name a few categories) is likely to feel satisfied that a particular topic of research was not glossed over simply to provide \\"the list.\\"  Authors Peter D'Epiro and Mary Desmond Pinkowish seem to have done their homework, and their writing style is straightforward and always engaging. <br /> <br />To give an example of how much information and detail can be found, question #49 asks \\"What are the 6 ranges of the human voice?\\"  Aside from simply naming the categories, the ensuing four pages cover a description of the anatomy of singing, voice characterizations and harmonic structures, before continuing in great detail about the specific vocal ranges (upper and lower frequencies), noteworthy singers, and even a history of which operatic pieces were written for which voices.  You can read as much detail as you want; there's certainly lots of information to learn about. <br /> <br />There are 101 lists (i.e., questions), ranging from \\"3\\" to \\"24.\\"  The most common groups are \\"3\\" and \\"7,\\" each of which has nineteen lists.  Five of the groupings contain only one list (e.g., \\"What are the 20 regions of Italy?\\").  Probably like most people, I was hoping to learn about some subjects that don't happen to appear in this book, for instance, the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame and the fourteen Stations of the Cross.  Still, there's enough interesting subject matter and good reading to keep anyone happy for quite a while.  Definitely worth a 5-star rating. <br />	2004-09-05

His writing style alternates between instructional, expository and a bit \\"gee whiz.\\"  Whatever the case, it's all very direct.  If you're open to a strongly libertarian point of view, you'll likely find this book interesting. <br /> <br />In a chapter that wasn't touched upon in \\"The Ten Things . . .\\" Mr. Elder doesn't pull any punches in criticizing the presidential administration(s) for misguided interests and federal spending before and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  He terms America's self-defense \\"job number one,\\" and has much to say about what he believes was proof of government's failure on that day.  There are also many interesting quotes (both pro- and anti-US) from Muslim writers about politics and life in middle eastern countries. <br /> <br />From a financial/economic policy viewpoint, Mr. Elder gives Republicans just as hard a time as Democrats.  He's obviously opposed to big government spending, but he gives many examples of how a wide ranging group of industries can obtain federal funding as a result of war, recession or disaster recovery. <br /> <br />As in previous writings, Mr. Elder visits the topics of race relations, media bias, gun control and \\"Republicans vs. Democrats\\" (he doesn't support either party).  He takes delight in recounting the news media point of view, and then adding contradictory bits of information that was not common knowledge, almost as if to ask \\"So, now what do you think?\\"  Even though he's a little rant-stricken at times, Mr. Elder is at once informative and entertaining.  He argues his points well, and I enjoy reading about his take on politics, social issues and the media even if I don't agree with everything he stands for.	2004-09-05

With a hundred entries, &quot;Wonders of the World&quot; would be monstrous were it to include much detail about each wonder.  However, many readers will find this an easy way to learn the salient points about many fantastic places, all in one book.<br />The primary arrangement is by continent, within which the wonders follow in chronological order.  Each time you turn the page, you're reading about a different place.  Every so often, there's a mini-chapter which generally describes civilizations or feats of man which proliferated, but couldn't be represented in a comprehensive way (e.g., &quot;The Inca Empire&quot; and &quot;Houses of God&quot;).  These touch on key points, and might inspire the reader to pursue further study of more in-depth literature.<br />Each of the wonders is presented very simply:  a world map in the corner, with a dot showing where on the planet it is situated; below that, a tiny political boundary map depicting area cities; two or three nice color photos; a five- to ten-paragraph description of the wonder; and lastly, a few paragraphs of complementary information relating to some part of history or related trivia.  For example, the entry for The Grand Canal (Venice) has interesting notes about the gondola and Piazza San Marco.<br />As with any &quot;best of&quot; book, one may question why some things are included and others are not, but that's an argument I won't take up here.  Yes, there are surely more than 100 magnificent places/things to see in the world; however, what's in this book is worth reading about, and I'd recommend &quot;Wonders of the World&quot; to just about anyone.	2004-06-13

Author Paul Davies wanders through a multitude of different angles related to contemporary thought in the realm of physics and mathematics, and how explanations can be arrived at to describe creation, nature, and numerous scientific laws.  Many great thinkers, past and present are cited, and it is easy to see how extensive debate can arise as scientific and philosophic thought evolve from developing theories.<br />For someone who is seeking a link between Judeo/Christian thought and scientific explanation, this book is not likely what you're looking for, and will not be easy to read  for those who are unfamiliar with cosmology, causation theories, quantum physics, logic and mathematical processes.  Though I have a basic understanding of the above, I still found it hard to concentrate and grasp all the physics theories.  The tie-in between scientific application and biblical history wasn't there.  The 3-star rating doesn't mean this book isn't good; I just happened to be expecting something different.	2004-02-14

Ms. Minks recounts the goings-on of the writers, patrons and artists which influenced many Hudson River School painters, such as Thomas Cole, Frederic Church, Martin Heade, George Inness, Worthington Whittredge and Albert Bierstadt, to name a few.  Twenty black-and-white illustrations (mostly photos of paintings and noteworthy people) appear along with the text.<br />The 80 color plates, about half of which extend to both pages of the open book, are arranged according to phases of the Hudson River School development:  &quot;Formative,&quot; &quot;Mature,&quot; and &quot;Expansionist.&quot;  Each phase is introduced with a page-long synopsis of what was happening at the time the artwork on the following pages was created.  As expected, Cole, Bierstadt and Church are the most represented (25 artists overall).  Also, Ms. Minks made sure to include in the color plates the artwork that was most discussed in the introduction.  The color printing is of excellent quality, as is the paper stock on which the artwork appears.  Given the size of the pages, I found it easy to spend a long time admiring all that was going on in each painting.	2003-09-08

Winner, a very well-read and erudite young woman, has many profoundly revealing things to say about how both Judaism and Christianity can hold special places in the heart and soul of a person who strives to be closer to God.  I fully expected \\"Girl Meets God\\" to be one of those books that compels me to spend time contemplating words of wisdom between every chapter; instead, I read the whole thing in two sittings.  It's that good.<br />I have to admit that I'm as impressed with the author as I am with her story, which involves converting to Orthodox Judaism and then leaving this for a deep and abiding Christianity.  \\"Girl Meets God\\" reads like a conversation rather than a sermon.  Although she's as clever as she is intelligent, Ms. Winner doesn't talk down to the reader, so you won't have to worry about feeling guilt or shame as a result of religious ambivalence or spiritual shortcomings.  Instead of myriad revelations, she's just telling her story, and she's happy to have you listen in.<br />If you've ever \\"felt funny\\" about praying, there's a chapter you can relate to.  Don't get as much out of worship services as you expected?  She's been there.  Surely, there are many far more formidable hurdles in the spiritual path.  In the chapter called \\"Holy Week,\\" a roadblock appears in Ms. Winner's realization that many Jews hated Christ and were responsible for His death.  At this point she's a Christian who can have no malice toward Jews.  Her reconciliation of her faith(s) comes later in a chapter entitled \\"Pentecost\\" which contains some rather profound words about spiritual lessons.<br />Ms. Winner's journey through Judaism to Christianity will be particularly interesting to those who find both beliefs palatable.  I happen to believe that God upholds a virtually identical set of morals and ethical values for both Jews and Christians, so it's easy for me to learn about both.  Of course, the two hold some divergent precepts; however, Ms. Winner goes beyond calling them out.  She studies various angles of interpretation, works her way through the Jewish and Christian history and writings (her knowledge of biblical language is extensive), finds common ground, and seems to be truly grateful for the realization that God speaks forcefully to two different sets of believers.  I'm just grateful for a little understanding and a lot more to consider . . . and for the fact that she saved me from spending years in the library trying to sort this stuff out.  This book is truly a gem.	2003-04-06

Ron Insana is a fine CNBC commentator who has been instrumental in turning what had long been characterized as dry news for a select few into witty and insightful stock market reporting with mass market appeal.  His first book, \\"Traders' Tales\\" tries to wow the reader with a bunch of gee-whiz stories, but there's just not much to impress in the way of secrets, outrage, shock value . . . whatever.<br />After being involved with the stock market for twenty years (the last fifteen as a professional), and thus being familiar with many names of those involved in the stories recounted by Mr. Insana, I still didn't find any story \\"tantalizing\\" or \\"shocking.\\"  Heck, anyone who's ever played on a sports team or in a rock 'n' roll band during high school could probably come up with ten crazier stories for every one in this book.  Instead, I thought the more interesting reading was in the chapters that gave historical perspective to the careers of Muriel Siebert, Ron Baron, Peter Lynch, and Jimmy Rogers, among others.  Everything else was pretty dull.<br />There's a tad too much explaining about market movement, stock/option price fluctuation, trading floor characteristics (did you know that tons of money can be made or lost very rapidly?), chart patterns, etc., so I'm thinking that those familiar with stock and bond investing might wind up somewhat bored.  Keep in mind, Mr. Insana was writing this in late-1995, way before many new investors were \\"seasoned\\" by the boom/bust in tech stocks, so some consideration of the time frame is warranted.<br />Overall, \\"Traders' Tales\\" might have mild appeal either to someone who has no experience with the stock markets, or to investors who might want to learn what all the market gurus we follow were doing decades ago.	2003-02-16

There's a spontaneity in Mr. May's portrayal of passionate couples, but what's more amazing is the intimacy infused in his work through extreme angles, creative cropping and the depiction of depth and movement.  I enjoy this book more every time I pick it up.<br />I'd say that \\"Couples\\" falls squarely between the refined artistry of Patrick Demarchelier's \\"Photographs\\" and the joyfully haphazard presentation of Sante d'Orazio's \\"A Private View.\\"  Mr. Demarchelier is unsurpassed (my opinion) in \\"nailing\\" a photo:  perfect pose, perfect angle, perfect exposure, perfect everything.  Mr. d'Orazio does a great job of chronicling a glamorous and fun lifestyle.  Whereas these two artists (both masters) still leave the viewer somewhat at a distance from their subjects, Mr. May brings us right into the photo with a perspective that can only be had from an involved point of view.  Sometimes we're spying ... undetected; other times, we're right in the scene ... point blank, yet ignored; still others, the subjects are looking right at us ... caught in the act.  There's movement, there's action, and everywhere there's the sense of erotic touch.  Sheer brilliance.  The chemistry (yes, those pheromones) of physical attraction is on virtually every page, but nothing about the photography is \\"dirty\\" or \\"in your face.\\"  <br />Save for the thickness (it's not), \\"Couples\\" is a large format book with coffee table dimensions.  The 100+ photos range from 3\\" x 5\\" all the way up to fully both pages of the open book.  There seems to be an overall randomness to the ordering, front to back, although there are many groupings (with titles) in place to portray photographic \\"suites\\" of a suggestive nature.  Not surprisingly, the couples are all gorgeous.  Not one looks at all posed, i.e., the spontaneity of the photo shoot(s) comes across very strongly.  These had to be the most enjoyable gigs for everyone involved.<br />\\"Couples\\" is recommended for lovers of love, as well as lovers of great b&w photography.	2003-01-03

Cook.  Though I'll admit to learning something about a rather interesting aspect of culture in the nineteenth century, I got really bogged down in a deluge of philosophizing and references to historical accounts, and thus had an extremely difficult time plowing through this book.  Unless you have a keen interest in the evolution of American culture, I can't make a strong recommendation here.<br />Mr. Cook, an Assistant Professor of History and American Culture at the University of Michigan, divides the book into five lengthy chapters, each offering a comprehensive examination of ONE aspect of how fraud (or trickery) was marketed in the 1800's:  1) The Automaton Chess Player, 2) The Feejee Mermaid, 3) The Nondescript (\\"What is It?\\"), 4) Modern Magic, and 5) Queer Art Illusions.  The only characters with whom I was familiar were Barnum, Houdini, and William Harnett, the \\"trompe l'oeil\\" painter.<br />The chapter about automatons was brand new information for me, and it was interesting and flowed okay, although I found it cumbersome to bounce around between the text and the notes (over one hundred).  By the second and third chapters, a pattern was ingrained:  good accounting by the author of some very curious expositions, but broken up by so much commentary from seemingly everyone who had anything to say or write about the spectacles during their time, that my mind just wandered all over the place.  Mr. Cook went around the horn so many times describing all the conjecture and shifting viewpoints held by the viewing public and the press, that I couldn't concentrate.  For me, there was an overbalanced emphasis placed on the societal impacts of, for example, Barnum's \\"What is It?\\" shows, rather than on the shows themselves.  What could have been a fun compilation of \\"gee whiz\\" stories turned out to be a textbook.  By the second chapter, I gave up trying to read all the notes (the book has almost 600).<br />My interest perked up a little in Chapter Five, which looked at \\"trompe l'oeil\\" painting, although I was rather surprised by Mr. Cook's equating this art form to yet another type of fraud.  In my opinion, the \\"trompe l'oeil\\" artwork of Harnett and his contemporaries was a style of painting that sought to create the most realistic depiction of a scene, and took some extremely talented--and patient--practitioners to produce.  I wouldn't categorize these artists as tricksters.  However, I'm no expert, so perhaps I'm missing something.<br />Overall, I think this book would have been more enjoyable if it didn't take itself too seriously.  If your leanings are toward the history and cultural evolution of magic and intrigue shows, you'll enjoy \\"The Arts of Deception.\\"  If you're looking for a lighter, perhaps more casual, introduction to the early culture of such shows, as I was, I'd recommend checking elsewhere first.	2002-12-29
US	52944303	RIBI4RRBLVJE9	1400046610	957571830	Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right	Books	3	25	57	N	N	Enlightening, semi-clever, yet not always a pleasant read	I recall Ann Coulter's appearances on political talk shows over the years, and I remember thinking that she is an articulate, somewhat angry, and definitely in-your-face political commentator.  With her book &quot;Slander,&quot; Ms. Coulter carries these traits into the written word.  There are some high points, including insightful descriptions of media spin and some comical portrayals of liberal policy makers.  Most politically right-leaning individuals are likely to nod in agreement with most of the arguments she makes in this, the latest of her &quot;Bestsellers,&quot; but the level of invective is so high as to be a potential turn-off.<br />If I were to use simple terms to summarize Ms. Coulter's stance on liberal bias, I'd choose &quot;double standard&quot; and &quot;contradiction.&quot;  What she is very good at is finding examples of how the media go bonkers over Republicans' indiscretions, but play down those of Democrats.  This trait, as she posits, manifests itself in ways that involve:  1) slamming conservative ideas, and fawning over liberal ones; or 2) using derogatory generalizations to classify conservative views, and laudatory ones to classify liberal views; or 3) character assassinations of Republican candidates, and constant praise for Democrats ... and so on.  Essentially true, but you've probably heard stuff like this before.  In this book, you get over two hundred pages of numerous (around 475,000; I lost count), well-documented examples of liberally biased propaganda.  Like her or not, she's usually pretty sharp.<br />As for me, I tend to side with Ms. Coulter on the issues put forth in her book, and I rather enjoyed the chapters that dealt with the 2000 presidential election (interesting things I hadn't heard before) and, especially, the chapter discussing the media's vacillation over whether or not the &quot;religious right&quot; is dead or alive.  Enlightening and funny.  Still, I had a hard time getting over the frequent, rant-stricken diatribes.  If she had left out the name-calling and condescending tone, her ideology would have come across as more intelligent and levelheaded.  Bernard Goldberg did this slightly better in &quot;Bias.&quot;  Dennis Prager is still the one to emulate (check out &quot;Think a Second Time&quot;).<br />Overall, I'd give this book a &quot;guarded&quot; recommendation.  The writing is strong, but the viewpoints may be unpalatable for some readers.	2002-08-20
US	52944303	R1C4MKY1OF7B2N	074324317X	474481314	At Home in the World	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Classic Journal quirkiness; detailed and illuminating	Being an avid reader of the Wall Street Journal for nearly a decade, the tragic loss of Daniel Pearl struck me hard even though I couldn't ever recall associating his name with a specific article.  \\"At Home in the World\\" is an excellent collection of writings exemplifying the in-depth--yet sometimes quirky--reporting like that often found in the middle column of the Journal's front page.  They're my favorite articles:  almost always interesting; so well-written.  Since I actually remembered some of the stories, perhaps I've been a fan of Mr. Pearl's all along.<br />I like the way this book is organized:  six parts, each one highlighting a literary style or theme infused with interesting facets of Mr. Pearl's life and personality (Editor Helene Cooper provides some insightful anecdotes at the beginning).  For example, Part Four (\\"Finding the Potholes ...\\") reveals his propensity for delving deep into the fabric of a society to get an unexpected story; Part Two (\\"I Hope Gabriel Likes My Music\\") plays off of his love for music ... all music.  The writings in each part are presented pretty much (occasional exceptions) in reverse chronological order, so that his work from WSJ stints in Atlanta, Washington, D.C., London, and India are kept together.  The fifty articles range in length from two to eleven pages, lending themselves well to intermittent reading when time is tight.  I don't imagine every article will be of interest to all readers, so there's the option of covering everything or just picking out what you consider interesting (I chose the former).  The book got better as I went along, with Part Six (\\"Nice Lede!\\") being the most entertaining.  The Appendix articles from the North Adams Transcript are hilarious.<br />This book should appeal especially to Journal fans and those who love reading (learning) about diverse subjects from many worlds.  I would also recommend this for anyone who wants to explore truly human topics that aren't offered on a daily basis by the news media.	2002-07-28
US	52944303	R2GED13JP48IQI	0446672289	231487583	The Death of Common Sense: How Law is Suffocating America	Books	4	41	45	N	N	A more intelligent look into legal lunacy; quick read	I wouldn't agree with the categorization of this book as an \\"explosive manifesto\\" (back cover), nor would I call this \\"incendiary ... stimulating\\" (front cover).  As an American who too often cringes when our country's regulatory red tape strangles expediency and constructive decision making, I'd say \\"The Death of Common Sense\\" offers some poignant anecdotes in describing today's bureaucratic morass.  Beyond this, author Philip K. Howard documents well the mentality which has spawned our dependency and passivity, and how we can refocus on how democracy is supposed to function.<br />Mr. Howard's messages, evident throughout, are very obvious:  we have substituted innovation with process, created enemies instead of cooperative societies, and squashed case-by-case reasoning under mountains of procedural law.  There are so many \\"rights\\" covering every interest group that very little gets done for the benefit of the majority.  \\"Trusting in the law\\" now means being wary of nearly everyone.  Although sounding a bit rant-stricken at times, Mr. Howard offers up lots of food for thought ... some amazing stories.  It's all pretty interesting and easy to read.<br />In my opinion, the last (and shortest) of the book's four parts, entitled \\"Releasing Ourselves,\\" falls short of hitting on a way to get out from under suffocating law.  I agree that initiative and responsibility are admirable attributes for executives in both the public and private arenas, and further, that universally applied policies that regulate the most minute procedural detail should instead have flexibility for more real-world applications.  However, what happens when the most innovative of directives winds up injuring or killing someone?  Will Joe Citizen give up his right (there's that word) to sue?  I doubt it.  And, as long as legal recourse remains the ultimate equalizer, the happy medium between \\"buried in the fine print\\" and \\"total judgment call\\" will be awfully hard to come by.  Mr. Howard doesn't address this issue.<br />This is a very good read; however, a better balance between problem and solution would have made this book outstanding.	2002-07-19
US	52944303	R1R9Z2Q873NRXF	0060522321	344700275	A Gospel of Shame: Children, Sexual Abuse, and the Catholic Church	Books	3	18	23	N	N	Catholischism	While not the most pleasant of topics, the disturbing news about sexual misdeeds by Catholic clergy is well-chronicled in \\"A Gospel of Shame,\\" although keep in mind that this book was originally published in 1993, so recent goings-on are touched upon only briefly in the new introduction and afterword.  Quite frankly, I was less interested in the subject matter than in what co-author Frank Bruni had to write about it (I really enjoyed his most recent book, \\"Ambling Into History,\\" about George W. Bush).  Overall, I'm mildly disappointed that this book was weighted far more toward storytelling than commentary and insight.  Also, I would have preferred an updated edition with news from the last few years interspersed throughout.<br />The first two-thirds of the book chronicles dozens of cases of child abuse by priests; however, the overriding message becomes clear:  sexual deviance among clergy is a big problem, but the bigger one is that the Catholic Church has tacitly sanctioned this misconduct through its failure to own up to it, treat these cases as crimes (as opposed to \\"sins\\"), and ultimately take steps to stop sexual abuse.  Authors Bruni and Burkett portray (rightly so, sad to say) Church officials as ignorant, secretive, self-serving masters of denial who sought more often to protect their own image than the souls of their flock of worshippers.  These are the ugliest examples of \\"the cover-up is worse than the crime,\\" and it's not joyful reading.<br />The book doesn't really get rolling until the latter third, where more is said about what some of the Church's victims were doing to better understand the root cause of sexual misconduct among clergy, communicate with the Church, and ultimately work toward eradicating this demon in the system.  It's a difficult proposition, but psychology, medicine, law, and even Christianity must all interact so that the Church can once again rightly serve its community of believers.  I hope there won't be cause for a new editionof this book ten years from now.	2002-07-13
US	52944303	R2KYMXIWIWUN9J	0465031773	417871783	The Death of Character: Moral Education in an Age Without Good or Evil	Books	3	27	31	N	N	Interesting; more about problems than solutions; tough read	Author James Davison Hunter is a very smart man who does a great job of tracing the changes in moral and social temperament over the years to show how weakened values and ideals have made their way into today's youth.  \\"The Death of Character\\" has lots of important things to say about the \\"transformation of moral education\\" (the title of the book's largest part), and though Mr. Hunter's views are erudite, his writing is really hard to absorb.  I'd be inclined to rate this more highly were it not for the fact that it took me forever to read.  This book would be great as a university text.<br />Much of what is explained about how our children are turning out revolves around three strategies for moral education:  psychological, neoclassical, and communitarian.  I learned quite a bit reading about these approaches and their influence on not only \\"why Johnny can't read,\\" but more importantly, \\"why Johnny lacks character.\\"  There's some good stuff to contemplate, and I found myself comparing my formative educational years with those of today's school kids.  Yep, big difference.  What Mr. Hunter has to say about the state of our youngsters must certainly be frustrating to the typical parent; however, there's not much in this book that addresses what to do about it.  Disappointing in that regard.<br />Each page of \\"The Death of Character\\" is chock full of well-referenced, expository writing:  full of discussion, argument and expanded viewpoints.  Although truly interested in grasping all that Mr. Hunter had to convey, I found myself getting bogged down amidst cumbersome wording within too many long sentences that had me reading them over and over again to zero in on the point.  My mind wandered frequently.  The more than sixty(!) pages of notes were occasionally intimidating (some notes cover multiple pages of even tinier type).<br />Overall, the importance of the topics covered were outweighed by the low \\"readability factor.\\"  I'd have to tackle this book again to get outof it what I'd expected.	2002-07-08
US	52944303	R37GRCIRNH5VVY	0066213711	63693352	Ambling Into History: The Unlikely Odyssey of George W. Bush	Books	5	4	8	N	N	Superb, unbiased commentary about Bush's campaign/character	I found this book on a ledge at a recycling center late at night (it's true), so I grabbed it even though I was more than a little  skeptical about the objectivity and fairness of a story about George W. Bush, written by a NY Times reporter and having the word \\"Ambling\\" in its title.  Still, I must admit that this turned out to be the most pleasant of surprises.  Author Frank Bruni has put together a rather unbiased, objective and downright enjoyable book about our President's politics and personality.  It's a great read.<br />Mr. Bruni covers the time frame from August 1999, during Governor Bush's campaign, through the weeks following the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  Aside from his excellent work in conveying the essence of Mr. Bush--both gentleman and politician--Mr. Bruni also provides superb, interesting perspectives on campaign journalism and life on the election trail.  The author injects NO bias into his commentary as he masterfully portrays all the facets of George W. Bush's persona:  candid, sincere, goofy, engaging, down-home, patriotic, and oftentimes pretty ordinary.  Whatever your political leanings, they probably won't by swayed one way or the other by Mr. Bruni; he gives us a character sketch which is fair, insightful and truly enjoyable to read.  At times I was amazed; other times I just laughed aloud.  <br />I also thought the backdrop of a presidential campaign added a colorful aspect to the author's \\"reporting.\\"  It reads like part diary, part script, and part ad-lib.  All three come together to result in a book that I'd recommend to just about anyone.  I see why Mr. Bruni was up for a Pulitzer Prize.	2002-05-28

Author and professional keynote speaker Shelly Brady does a good job of recounting the character of this incredible man through her interaction with Mr. Porter as both friend and business associate.  Though the book is small, its impact is wide-ranging.  Aside from being drawn in by an inspirational story, I also found myself thinking often of how the \\"ten things\\" could apply to my life.<br />I'm not knowledgeable about cerebral palsy, and I don't even know anyone who has CP.  Nonetheless, it sounds to me like a major handicap.  The biggest impact that Bill Porter's story had on me was that everything the typical person would consider to be a handicap, an obstacle, a disability, or a setback, would not only be written off by Mr. Porter as unimportant, but instead considered to be a springboard to something better or more positive.  There's a lesson here for everyone.<br />The engaging story covers 132 pages, followed by another 30-plus pages of letters received mainly in response to a 20/20 television feature on Mr. Porter that aired in December of 1997.  I didn't see the show, but I'm convinced it had a profound effect on a multitude of viewers.  There's also a brief afterword by Mr. Porter himself, so heartfelt that I wondered whether or not a first-person account might have made the book even better.  There may not be philosophical \\"words to live by\\" on every page, but Ms. Brady just might prove to you that your life is better than you think.<br />Overall, I'd recommend this book to just about anyone.	2002-05-16

Yes, the pictures are fantastic, and I was even pleasantly surprised with the reading.<br />Winston Link was a fine photographer who took it upon himself to document the last years of steam railroading by traveling the Norfolk & Western Railway routes in the 1950's.  His project started with nighttime b/w photos, and later expanded to daytime b/w's and color photos.  His work has made it to numerous museums and art collections, and it's easy to see why:  the photographs in this book are stupendous.<br />Mr. Link had a kind of \\"photographic vision\\" that produced something interesting to admire in virtually every photo he published.  I'd call every one in this book a work of art.  In addition to portraying the \\"machines,\\" the human element has a strong presence as well, from those who toiled for N&W, to those who are shown just watching the trains go by.  Their faces will forever be a part of Mr. Link's chronicling of steam railroading.  The color photography has some amazingly striking depictions of rural scenes, almost to the point of making the train a welcome denizen of the countryside.<br />Thomas H. Garver provided the text, both the biographical documentation of Mr. Link's photographic/artistic endeavors and the captions supporting the illustrations (over 150).  Photo historians will enjoy the former; Americana buffs will love the latter.	2002-04-04

I was already a fan of Rabbi Joseph Telushkin's writing when a long-time buddy of mine gave me \\"The Book of Jewish Values\\" as a gift.  Before I even opened it, I knew I had a gem.<br />Very simply, Rabbi Telushkin's writing is direct, concise, up-to-date and easy to understand.  Also ... important!  You don't have to be Jewish (I'm not) to appreciate the relevance of the ethical guidelines on which the author elaborates.  For each day of the year (excluding the Shabbat) one of a broad range of issues is discussed and highlighted either anecdotally through quotes by other noted Rabbis or supported by reference to important Jewish literature (e.g., the laws of the Torah and Talmud).  You probably won't find 300+ issues applicable to your life, but every page is worthwhile reading nevertheless.  The most pertinent and/or interesting topics to me were the ones involving relationships, charity, kindness, and speech.<br />The book's format is suited to every kind of reading habit, so go at whatever pace you like.  Each day is comprised of 1-3 pages, with cross-referencing where related discussion appears elsewhere in the book.  Also, footnotes can be found on the same page where a reference is cited (I appreciate this) so you don't have to turn to the back of the book to check a source.  In the event you do turn to the back, you'll find a decent glossary, bibliography and index.<br />Whether your intention is to learn or to simply bolster your moral convictions, I give this book my highest recommendation.	2002-02-16

In \\"50 Favorite Rooms by Frank Lloyd Wright,\\" Diane Maddex (listed in the credits as \\"Project Director\\") has crafted a book that is clean, simple and elegant in its presentation of the architect's trademark design of personal living spaces.<br />If you've visited more than a few of Frank Lloyd Wright's creations, chances are they won't all be represented here.  He completed hundreds of homes and buildings, which means that this book could have been entitled \\"250 Favorite Rooms ...\\" and it still would have been too thin.  What you do find are superb photos which are amazingly successful in capturing the perspective and harmony of lines, space, furniture, ornamentation and even lighting.  My favorite views are inside the homes, but the public spaces are interesting also.  You don't have to be an architect to appreciate the mastery in Mr. Wright's designs.<br />The chapters are grouped by room type (e.g., living rooms, dining rooms), with each of the pictures taking up AT LEAST one full page, and supported by 20-30 lines of text describing key design aspects of the room.  The photos are of the highest quality in terms of exposure, lighting and balance.  In some cases, the vantage point allows for a look beyond the windows to the surrounding landscape or greenery.  A nice touch, indeed.  In short, if you're looking for the definitive image of a room, you'll find a bunch of them right here.<br />If Mr. Wright had designed a book, I think this is what he'd have come up with.  I give this my highest recommendation.	2002-02-01

That a highly regarded news reporter would raise some serious doubts about how his company--his industry--reported news was praiseworthy in and of itself, in my mind.  However, I had no idea that it would blow up so big as to produce a book like \\"Bias,\\" by Mr. Goldberg himself.<br />You may have already read something from other authors (e.g., Dennis Prager, Larry Elder) who have taken it upon themselves to expose the hypocritical, left-leaning, unobjective and corrupt (not all my words) forces that have worked their way into the news media and minds of their figureheads who blab at us from our TV sets.  Yes, I believe:  1) that the mainstream media slants left, 2) that the network news frames the coverage and discussion so as to mold a \\"liberal\\" mindset, and 3) that much of the news that ought to be reported doesn't make it into our homes.  Still, with all the objectivity I can muster, I will say that \\"Bias\\" is quite a revealing book that will appeal to everyone . . . well, almost.<br />What I liked most about this book is that the author makes examples of real situations and real media moguls in getting across his point about how influential a political/social predisposition can be in reporting news.  He truly knows all the players.  Aside from the important issues of homelessness and drug abuse, the news events most discussed are ones which had Americans (perhaps most of the world) glued to the television during the past decade:  the Oklahoma City Bombing, the presidential scandals, and the terrorist attacks of last September 11.  The back-and-forth between Mr. Goldberg and his bosses was, on one hand, hard to believe, but on the other, something that anyone who's ever crossed a supervisor (even unwittingly) can relate to.  Even in the media, the influence peddlers will say and do whatever they have to in order to pump up their agendasAND the bottom line.<br />The fact that I flew through this book tells me that I must have enjoyed it a lot.  I really did.  There was one major bad vibe though:  I wasn't wild about the recurring use of derogatory names for a number of the author's detractors (Dan Rather, among numerous others), gratuitous profanity (just the four-letter words NOT in quotations), and some silly argumentative analogies, which I feel made Mr. Goldberg seem a little too rant-stricken.  My preference would have been for a more level-headed diatribe . . . if that's possible.  Sounds more upstanding, you know.<br />Overall, I'd say that the strength of this book is its \\"insider's view,\\" and for that I'd recommend it to almost anyone except those possessing a strong affinity for mainstream political/social commentary.	2002-01-23

After reading two other \\"Builders\\" books (\\"Airport Builders\\" and \\"Church Builders\\") I am now three times impressed.<br />The first third of \\"Monument Builders\\" contains a very good description of the evolution of the \\"architecture of death,\\" touching on the necropolis, various forms of ancient tombs, and the different manifestations of modernism, including expressionism, cubism and other applications pertaining to war memorials.  It's a fine recounting of the history, architectural style and attitudes toward remembering the dead.<br />The remainder of the book focuses on specific architectural projects with several pages of text supplemented by superb photos, plan drawings and renderings in the first-rate style which typifies Mr. Heathcote's work in this series of books.  In most cases, it's one monument per architect; however, an occasional pleasant deviation results in the exposition of several creations by a given architect.  I reiterate:  the photograpic work is incredible.<br />Again, true to form, Academy Editions has published a solid volume on quality paper, suitable for library or coffee table.	2002-01-21

I absolutely LOVE books that blow the commonly espoused views of the media to smithereens.  In that regard, this one by Larry Elder, author and talk show host, gets an A+.<br />\\"The Ten Things You Can't Say in America\\" takes a look at a number of issues at the forefront of political discourse: black/white prejudice, media bias, the health care \\"crisis,\\" welfare, drugs and gun control, to name a few.  Supported by an amazingly comprehensive reference base of notes, Mr. Elder calls on speeches, newspaper articles, quotes from TV news anchors, and even his own conversations, to highlight all the information the media leave out in spinning the news.  This is the stuff we ought to be hearing about, but don't get to because too many in the media don't have the backbone to report it.  I happen to have lots of respect for those, like Mr. Elder, who can take an unpopular stand and argue it well.  His philosophy is sound, though strident at times, and he makes many excellent points.  My only criticism is that the author is too condescending in his use of derogatory terms to describe those who hold views contrary to his.  If his tone had been more respectful (as opposed to \\"talking down\\") I'd have given his book five stars without a second thought.  Still, Mr. Elder has a voice, and I support his right to use it as he pleases.<br />I truly believe that the strict Libertarian view expressed in \\"The Ten Things ...\\" should be considered by everyone, but I imagine that hard-core followers of liberal platforms are going to have a hard time with this.  All told, I give a big thumbs up to a guy who's not afraid to make a case for facts which fly in the face of conventional \\"wisdom.\\"	2001-10-17

Well, it does.  Love triangles have been around since early writing, and are with us to this day all over television.  Even so, author Katie Estill makes a decent attempt at producing an interesting story in her first novel, &quot;Evening Would Find Me.&quot;  Unfortunately, too many faults keep me from raving about this book.  [Sorry to break the string of stellar reviews]<br />By telling the story in the first person, I can't help but think that the author has thrown herself into the character of Sylvia, a woman who flees to Greece after her mother dies.  By page 16, she's falling in love with Ari, a painter who happens to be married to a goddess-like (of course), but schizophrenic woman, Althea.  I won't go into details, but lots of juicy, emotional events follow, some with tragic consequences.  Overall, it's an okay story that held my interest, but didn't move me very much in the end.<br />That Ms. Estill is enamored of Greece is obvious.  Aside from having lived and traveled there for five years, she over-seasons her novel with as many Greek phrases, names of places, and food items as will fit in a little book.  That may sound picky, but I would have prefered instead that the space be used for describing the Greek culture and/or developing characters.  ESPECIALLY developing characters.  In my opinion, the author shrouded the principal figures (and even the country) in so much mystery and enchantment that it was hard for me to know them.  What about Ari's sister-in-law, Elena?  She had an absolutely intriguing demeanor and could have been a fascinating force in this plot, but alas, there was more to be said about the quirky way Greeks like their coffee than about this interesting woman.  Same for Sylvia's elderly neighbor, Mr. Lapidus.<br />It may sound odd, but I would have been happier with this storyif it were longer (i.e., a more involved plot and deeper characters) and had flowed better between images and time frames.  For fans of romance novels with lots of emotion and interpersonal conflict, this book will probably be to your liking.  Better yet, it might actually provide a good basis for a screenplay.  As for me, I felt like I was looking at a nice tapestry with too many worn-out spots.	2001-10-17

Thanks to author Lesley Downer, this fine book has given me an understanding and appreciation of a mysterious world within a fascinating country.<br />&quot;Women of the Pleasure Quarters&quot; begins with a first person account of Ms. Downer's attempts to gain the &quot;inside&quot; perspective to what has been for centuries a virtually secret society.  Throughout the book, I found captivating her recounting of meetings and conversations with those connected with the geisha life:  proprietors and &quot;clients&quot; of the tea houses, teachers, artists, wig makers, and the maiko and geisha themselves.  The diversity of aspects woven into Ms. Downer's journalistic endeavors (mostly from time spent in Kyoto and Tokyo) are impressive, encompassing folklore, poetry, theater, music, fashion, art, and the geisha's mastery of charm and conversation.  It's an entertaining read, more so than I expected, and her photos add a nice, diary-like touch to the writing.<br />Aside from the author's documentation of geisha life, there's also much to be told about Japanese history and legend, and the evolution of the role of geisha and maiko, beginning with the 17th century tea houses and ending with the present times.  While I found the history and literature lessons to be mildly interesting, I was much more fascinated with the participation of Ms. Downer in her ventures behind the gates of the &quot;flower and willow&quot; world.  To me, the bouncing around between first and third person story telling--present, then past, and again--upset the flow of this book, but only slightly (my only criticism).  I wanted to read more about the author's tales.<br />All things considered, I'd recommend this book to just about anyone.  By her curiosity and persistence, Ms. Downer gives us much more than just an acquaintance with the women behind the painted faces.	2001-07-29
US	52944303	R2I39SL54IHAIZ	1559724773	937504851	How To Control Your Anxiety Before It Controls You	Books	5	60	67	N	N	Easy read; comprehensive action methods to control anxiety	At the time I bought this book, I was unaware of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, had never heard of Dr. Albert Ellis, and wasn't really looking to solve any particular anxiety problem of my own.  Always a fan of Dale Carnegie's &quot;How to ...&quot; instructional writings, I figured this would be a new perspective on a popular and important subject.  What I learned was that Dr. Ellis has extensive experience (since 1943) in psychotherapy and actually devised REBT in 1955.  Like Carnegie, he is quite good at putting his research and wisdom into books (more than sixty), and turning this knowledge into useful information for those who might be trying to solve a problem related to emotion and personality.<br />To me, the most important part of REBT is &quot;Rational,&quot; the exercise of thinking through what is causing anxiety, why your beliefs about it are unfounded (i.e., irrational) and unnecessary, and what you can do to convince yourself that anxiety can be lessened, if not eliminated, through a formulaic rational process.  Throughout most of this book, Dr. Ellis clearly describes nearly twenty very specific methods for controlling anxiety.  This was all new to me, but I found the methods to make total sense, and imagined that almost all of us could find any number of these helpful in addressing specific anxiety scenarios.<br />The way in which Dr. Ellis sets forth the varying aspects of REBT is impressive.  He's easy to read, and almost grandfatherly in his tone.  Each method is portrayed first by explanation, then by documenting a real example using one of his psychotherapy patients.  The last three chapters contain 231 &quot;Rational Maxims&quot; which sum up the main points of the methods discussed in detail earlier, and are written in the first person for us to recite when REBT enforcement is needed.  Good idea!  Some might find this book to be a little repetitive (therapy is like that), and thus may be better off with the abridged version.  For someonenew to REBT, I'm glad Dr. Ellis presented these methods in a comprehensive manner, and I'll always have the Rational Maxims for review on short order.	2001-06-24

And it's all symbolized with an iconic wink (or a gesture suggesting one) on the cover of every issue.<br />Throughout the nearly 600 pages of this heavy, photo-packed book (which I happily made the time to survey, one page at a time, front to back), you'll see a maturation from a haphazardly compiled fanzine of punk fashion to a more polished journal of all that which is currently fashionable.  No subtle difference, indeed.  Black and white photos of random subjects sporting the latest in 80's leather, safety pins and spiked hair give way in the 90's to better-produced shots of more recognizable models and artists.  I'm impressed that the raw, &quot;immediate&quot; flavor of the photography and design just gets better throughout i-D's first twenty years.<br />There's not enough space to detail all the things I liked about this book, but I found especially interesting the early photos of some models and pop icons before they became widely known.  I thought the numerous quotes by artists/actors/musicians added a good comical complement to the pictures.  Also, the refinement (my opinion) of grahic design techinque is evident with the aging of i-D:  it's not unlike looking at a scrapbook of an acne-ridden adolescent who grows into a hip and handsome young adult.  Although i-D is somewhat new to me, it's now one of my favorite style publications.  I wish I hadn't missed the first couple hundred issues, but I'm glad I got this book.	2001-06-23

He demonstrates his ability to keep several sub-plots (involving romance, suspense, struggle) going at once, and to connect them in the reader's mind without impeding the flow of the story.  His characterizations are quite strong, and I found myself figuring out very quickly who was to be liked, and who wasn't.  Even the animals had personalities.  Though I'm not in the top tier of nature enthusiasts, I thoroughly enjoyed reading and learning about the environment of wolves, the toil of ranchers and trappers, and how simple--and hard--life can be in beautiful Montana (I've visited; it's gorgeous).<br />Overall, I found &quot;The Loop&quot; (named after a trap for catching wolves) to be very well-paced (no slow chapters) and captivating.  The evolving story line really kept me turning the pages, and even though the ending unwound just a little too fast for my taste, I'd recommend this book to anyone desiring a solid, satisfying novel.	2001-05-21

When I first started reading &quot;Model Patient,&quot; by TV personality/model/actress Karen Duffy, I was ready for another one of those charmed-life-hits-a-wall documentaries.  As it turned out, I wound up pleasantly surprised.<br />I had always perceived &quot;Duff&quot; as a cute, stylish, somewhat saucy personality with a spiky sense of humor.  This book alters that perception not one bit.  Duff's story goes way beyond that of a living-life-large, party-chick celebrity who capitalized on resourceful ambition and good breaks to hit the big time after a dull middle-class upbringing, only to have tragedy bring her down to earth again.  Aside from going into the details of sarcoidosis, I'd say that Duff did an excellent job of conveying how important focusing on life's big picture is, while still having the strength to mow down all the troublesome setbacks that appear almost daily to one with a life-threatening disease.  Said another way, the support of friends, family and doctors is great, but a substantial amount of individual fortitude must complement this in order to prevail over a seemingly endless battery of medical tests, medications, or even a daily routine which has become literally painful.  Duff is truly a survivor, and has developed a habit of thumbing her nose at death.<br />In addition to an interesting autobiography (even her husband wrote one of the chapters), Duff gives us her erudite advice about doctors' manners, outpatient tips, hospital etiquette, and even some self-deprecating humor and jokes about the medical profession.  She recounts her life's tales in a way that is, at various times, philosophical, light-hearted, cocky, and witty. And, she's always optimistic.  This book is amazingly upbeat, and definitely NOT in the style of &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; (a book about which Duff has some unkind words; I loved it), but the message of learning how to deal with setbacks, focusing on life's meaning, and keeping your head up at all times comes through just as clearly.  Overall, it's a fun read.	2001-05-16
US	52944303	R17QDQX2ZGY4EC	0553375067	559651636	Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ	Books	3	444	497	N	N	Many interesting things to consider, but becomes monotonous	I must admit I'm torn between a thumbs up and a thumbs down for this book (hence, 3 stars).  Author Daniel Goleman does a fine job of employing a vast library of behavioral research in support of the premise that emotional conditioning plays a dominant role in what we perceive as &quot;intelligence.&quot;  Even though one can learn lots from Goleman's work, the overriding theme here seems to me to be ridiculously simple:  good nurturing (rather than aptitude) is more likely to produce exceptional humans; bad nurturing creates people with a bunch of problems.<br />The book starts off great, with a look at what happens in the brain at the molecular level under all sorts of emotional experiences.  That's Part One (Goleman recommends skipping this if you're not into neurological details), which turned out to be the most interesting for me, as I had never before learned much about the emotional &quot;architecture&quot; of the brain.<br />In Parts Two through Five, the author expounds on feelings (e.g., anger, empathy, passion, depression), personality, upbringing, aptitude, and treatment, etc., citing study after study to show that today's children are most decidedly a product of how they were treated in their earliest years, but nevertheless are winding up far less able then their ancestors were to handle even the slightest emotional dilemma.  In fact, the further on you read, the more you'll realize that &quot;Emotional Intelligence&quot; is a book about children.  Why is their character deteriorating, and what can we do to mold them into more emotionally strong (intelligent) beings?  That's okay:  if you're a parent, educator, or child psychologist, definitely buy this book.  It will help.<br />As for me, I appreciated Goleman's connection of personality with science in an unexpected, enlightening way.  However, except for Part One, I got so bogged down in page after page of studies and stats, all concluding the same thing over and over again, that it became a chore to plow through to the end.  Overall, this is a monumental work, but I can't recommended it to everyone.	2001-05-04

It's big, colorful, and balmy enough to make you long for a cool shower.<br />If you're a connoisseur of the finest in photographic images, you may be somewhat underimpressed.  Although &quot;HotHouse&quot; is nearer to boiling than freezing, I wouldn't rate the seductivity level as highly as David Wild--who writes the introduction--would make it out to be (see instead the work of Herb Ritts and Sante d'Orazio, among others).  Still, overall, it's definitely worth a few looks.<br />The roughly 100 quality photos get high marks for being uninhibited, expressive, and big (each taking up AT LEAST a full page, thank you).  On the downside, I take exception to the overuse of the airbrush and the underuse of b/w photography (but that's just me and my preferences).  Thirty-one photographers are represented; however, nearly two-thirds of the shots were taken by only four:  Mark Seliger, Isabel Snyder, David LaChapelle and Martin Schoeller.  The credits list nothing more than subject and artist, but that's not a major drawback for this type of book.  My favorite photos are the b/w of Jennifer Love Hewitt (that face!) and the color shot of Charlize Theron reclining with a wooden mannequin (great imagination!).  Other notables are of Katie Holmes, Ananda Lewis, Mariah Carey, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and Mena Suvari.<br />All in all, this is a very worthwhile book for fans of young entertainers or photography.	2001-04-08

Francesca Premoli-Droulers presents a nice &quot;pictorial tour&quot; of the homes and properties, and does a great job of describing the emotional connection between the artists' lives and the places where they created their literary works.  The first-rate photography, by Erica Lennard, is a superb complement to the text.<br />Each of the 21 homes (including that of Marguerite Duras, who wrote the prologue) is presented over eight to ten pages--with an equal number of color photos--of reverent writing and stories about what brought the author to that particular home, the inspiration created by the residence and its grounds, and the goings-on of the day.  It's excellent reading.<br />Photographer Lennard more often than not does a good job of capturing the natural lighting to give depth and &quot;feel&quot; to the interior spaces.  My favorite shots are the ones of doorways, stairways and porches.  There are also close-ups of desks, books, and various nicknacks, which add intimacy and personality to the pictures, although perspective is occasionally lost from being a little too close up.  Also, it would have been perfect to see some aerial photos of the extent of the grounds and the character of their settings, especially for the Dossi, Faulkner, Hemingway, Hesse and Moravia homes.  Still, this is a first-rate addition to anyone's library.	2001-04-05

I was looking for a book that would offer more than a study guide to the digestive system combined with an encyclopedia on dietary measures, and I wound up more pleased than ever!  Author Rosemary Nicol's diverse handling of everything from symptoms (both physical and emotional) of IBS and similar ailments, to stress management, antidotes and diet is absolutely impressive.<br />I'm not sure what her background is, but Ms. Nicol's writing exhibits thoughtful, intelligent and especially sensitive insight in discussing IBS from the perspectives of biology, psychology, and personality.  Then, she elaborates on a range of antidotes too numerous to detail in this space.  The one thing that will forever stand out in my mind after reading this book is the absolutely outstanding sensitivity with which the author discusses the psychological and emotional aspects linked to IBS.  Her writing is simple and personable, and she doesn't talk down to the reader by throwing in tons of technical terms.  The section on diet is very good, but the greatest comfort comes from someone who knows how you feel, and who looks at every angle imaginable in helping you find solutions to this bothersome condition.  I give this my highest recommendation.	2001-03-31
US	52944303	R2BE0SVEFC2A3P	1557787883	323279141	From Rage to Responsibility: Black Conservative Jesse Lee Peterson and America Today	Books	4	21	21	N	N	Opinionated, forceful (maybe too strident) ... yet inspiring	The cover describes the author as a &quot;Black Conservative,&quot; so you probably already know what's coming.  Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson pulls no punches in calling on the African-American community (especially the men) to provide the impetus in reversing the trend toward social dysfunction.  &quot;From Rage to Responsibility&quot; is one man's tough prescription for overcoming the &quot;victimhood&quot; that permeates the mindset of minorities in America today.<br />This book is organized very simply in seven chapters.  The first is a brief historical account dealing with the path Rev. Peterson took to get where he is today.  The middle five chapters expound on the &quot;Problems With ...,&quot; in order:  Race, Men and Women, Abortion, Immigration, and Education.  The final chapter tells us what to do to defeat these problems.  Each chapter is chock full of statistics (most of which I found rather eye-opening) and anecdotes supporting the author's contention that society (especially black America) is heading in the wrong direction faster than what the media are reporting.  He backs up his numbers and quotes with an exhaustive list of reference notes.  The overall message:  morality has been cast aside, life is being dehumanized, God is forgotten, and no one seems to take responsibility for anything.  The tone and viewpoint are decidedly very conservative (Peterson admits as much), and if you lean too far to the [political] left, you might be taken aback if you're sensitive to proselytizing.  Still, the topics are worth the consideration, and I have no problem with someone expressing himself this way.<br />The only shortcoming of this book is the last chapter, which should have had more to say toward altering perspectives, changing attitudes, and re-thinking the way we relate to different generations and ethnicities.  Instead of generalities (&quot;focus on the family,&quot; &quot;recover the knowledge we once had&quot;), I think a point/counterpoint type of discussion might have been more informative.  Still, this book is a good effort from a man who's pretty good at expressing a strong, sincere point of view.	2001-03-28

Cutler, M.D., a psychiatrist.  Dr. Cutler weaves together exerpts from numerous conversations with His Holiness spanning many years, and from public talks given by the Dalai Lama throughout Arizona in 1993.  The result is an enjoyable and enlightening treatise on a topic of widespread importance:  happiness (or the lack thereof).<br />The book begins by establishing a datum with respect to the purpose of life and the nature of human drives and emotions, and moves on to the overcoming of suffering, anger, hatred and anxiety.  Dr. Cutler assumes the position of middleman in passing on to the reader many words of wisdom and by asking the Dalai Lama questions we ourselves might ask as to how to apply Buddhist practices to western society's efforts toward achieving a satisfying, stress-free life.  It's a good formula.  Dr. Cutler asks the right questions in getting the Dalai Lama to move beyond spiritual edicts, and elaborate on a kind of &quot;westernized methodology&quot; (my words) we can try in attempting to enhance our own emotional well-being.  I found the many comparisons between eastern religious practice and western clinical treatment to be very interesting.<br />If you're after involved, thought-provoking discussions about the intellectual view of relationships and emotional conflicts, this book might come up a little short (read instead &quot;Happiness is a Serious Problem,&quot; by Dennis Prager).  Still, the wisdom and level-headed composure of the Dalai Lama that Dr. Cutler brings out puts this book high on my recommended list.	2001-03-26

What ensues is an entertaining story (I'll admit it) about mice and &quot;littlepeople&quot; with a moral that can be summed up very easily:  1) once you attain a certain plateau in life, you'll probably get lazy; 2) human nature is to strive for a comfort zone, and thus, resist change; 3) nothing in life is static, so pay attention to new trends; and 4) don't be afraid to seek a new and better situation with every opportunity.<br />Yes, I'm one of those who was handed &quot;Who Moved My Cheese?&quot; at a recent staff meeting, and I couldn't help but think that the authors' sole objective was to market a book that would be bought in large quantities by every Human Resources department in the world.  Turn to the back, and you'll find a form for ordering more copies.  Borrow one; it's overpriced.<br />If you're involved in a relationship (work-related or otherwise) and are unaware of feeling complacent or stifled, this book may very well be a revelation, and compel you to rave to all your friends.

Ewing has put together a well-structured presentation of photoworks taken from exhibitions in Lisbon (1999) and Lausanne (2000).  I was as impressed with the organization of this book as I was with the photographic artwork itself.<br />The foreword gives a nice explantion of the how the book tries to capture the essense of the European exhibition, and is followed by a dozen or so pages chronicling the evolution of photographic science and human body photography through the 1900's.  Mr. Ewing, who is Director of the Musée de l'Elysée in Lausanne, definitely knows his stuff; this is interesting reading.<br />The one hundred photos (all b/w except for a handful) are displayed in chronological order, and in much the same way as a museum would:  photograph on the right-hand page; title and credit on the left.  A major plus is the insightful commentary about the artists and their photographic styles which accompanies each photo credit.  In keeping with the gallery presentation, thirteen themes are evidenced in this collection, the most prominent being &quot;Expression,&quot; &quot;Form,&quot; &quot;Politics,&quot; &quot;Fiction,&quot; and &quot;Flesh.&quot;<br />&quot;The Century of the Body&quot; portrays many photographic genres:  Pictorialism, Modernism, Surrealism, body art, fashion and even endoscopic photography.  Noteworthy contributors include Stieglitz, Imogen Cunningham, Man Ray, Weston, Avedon and Mapplethorpe.  Every image made me look a long time; none were lewd or offensive.  I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in photographic style, or simply . . . art.	2001-03-16

I still appreciate all the different ways of cross referencing, especially the listing of actors/actresses, since I often can't remember a movie title, but can remember who was in it.  You know how that is.<br />The individual film listings go way beyond director and key actors.  Even less-than-star players get a mention, as well as the writer, cinematographer, and composer/lyricist.  Also included is a listing of all the nominations and awards a film received.  Every so often, a particular review will give a heads-up about an interesting piece of movie trivia, or cameo by someone who didn't get top billing.<br />I'd be inclined to give this five stars, but I'm still waiting for the editor to put back the foreign film index and the &quot;content warning&quot; descriptions, which were very useful to me, but discontinued after the 1999 edition.

Whether you're an architect or not, you'll find this fascinating.<br />Throughout the first third of the book, Edwin Heathcote exhibits a broadly based and well-researched background in covering the advancement in concepts which influenced church design and construction through the 1900's.  Citing numerous architectural trend setters, Mr. Heathcote describes in an eruditious manner the relationship between theology, liturgical reform, and modernism, and how they contributed to the &quot;expression of piety&quot; seen in today's church building throughout the world.<br />The remainder of the book is entitled &quot;Movements of the Spirit,&quot; in which Iona Spens compiles a series of &quot;portfolios&quot; from noted architects/firms, and supplements her text with excellent photos, plans and elevations.  The color photography, both of interiors and exteriors, is downright breathtaking in many cases, and does great justice to the defining, creative aspects of each church.<br />This is the second &quot;Builders&quot; book I've bought (the other being &quot;Airport Builders&quot;), and I like this one the best simply because the photography is more easily able to capture the essence of the architectural creation.  As with the other, this edition is of the highest quality: bound well, and printed on the best paper.  Highest recommendation.	2001-03-05

Unfortunately, it doesn't take long to realize that there are many things missing from what could be a first-rate travel book.<br />If you're thinking of buying this book, keep in mind that there is little else besides restaurants and hotels in the way of reviews (emphasis on the former).  In the Paris section of the book, you'll find almost three times the number of pages devoted to restaurants as there are for hotels.  The eateries are arranged by arrondissement, as expected; however, the hotels are instead arranged by class (&quot;luxury,&quot; &quot;classic,&quot; &quot;charming,&quot; etc.), which makes searching for lodging by area impossible.  Overall, the commentary is usually quite good, although suprisingly more descriptive for the restaurants.  There are also reviews of a select few specialty shops (e.g., flowers, perfume, luggage) which might be somewhat helpful to upscale shoppers.  Big ommission:  not one map of Paris, even by arrondissement (to my knowledge, the only guide of its kind without one).  The requisite metro map was also nowhere to be found.<br />The organization of the &quot;Out of Paris,&quot; Provence, and Riviera regions takes on yet a different convention.  In these cases, the cities and towns are arranged in alphabetical order with the hotels and restaurants lumped together.  Here, you can actually find city maps with numbered lodging and eating places.<br />In my opinion, the strength of this book lies entirely in the restaurant reviews.  If your interests include anything else besides fine dining, look elsewhere if you're searching for a good, all-in-one travel guide.	2001-02-24

[Note: This is the second book of Mr. Quisenaerts' &quot;Hotel Gems ...&quot; series that I've reviewed, the first being the one featuring France].<br />With four to six pages covering each hotel, the author uses storybook imagery in describing each of the [only?] 36 best places to stay in Italy, including the islands of Sicilia, Sardinia, and Stromboli.  The photography is absolutely gorgeous and just about as informative as the text (for the really practical info, turn to the back of the book).  A minor drawback is the absence of corresponding numbers to link the hotels on the reference map with the featured text/pictures that form the bulk of the book (the French &quot;Gems&quot; had this useful feature; I don't know why it was left out for this edition).  This results in much back-and-forth page flipping, which could make planning an itinerary somewhat more arduous.  Also, it would have been helpful to specify the regions (again, à la France) in which the hotels are found.  Still, if it's great interiors and travel photography you're after, you can't go wrong with this book.	2001-02-24
US	52944303	R2KHRH42IPUAH7	0316286443	580713451	Face Forward	Books	5	73	75	N	N	Exceptional, from both artistic and &quot;how-to&quot; perspectives	If you've ever looked at fashion magazines and wondered what makeup techniques went into creating the look, &quot;Face Forward&quot; may give you all the answers you need.  Not only did Kevyn Aucoin do all the makeup in this book, but he also wrote it and contributed to the photography, art direction and design.  He is a genius.  Period.<br />Outside of the introductory chapters, the book is divided into five main parts:  1) &quot;Behind Beauty,&quot; where Kevyn describes how he treats the face to bring out a wide range of attributes; 2) &quot;Face to Face,&quot; which consists of in-depth photography and illustrations of the steps involved with creating beautiful looks; 3) &quot;Dimensions,&quot; where Kevyn explores the &quot;classic personifications of beauty&quot; by making up actresses and models to look like stars of the past; and 4) &amp; 5) forward-looking concepts of makeup techniques and the future of beauty, also using the faces of actresses (and even his mom).<br />I think it's great that someone as talented as Kevyn can be so generous in explaining his craft, but even if you're not into that, &quot;Face Forward&quot; holds up fantastically on its merits as an art/photography book:  the resemblance of the current stars to the past ones is incredible (e.g., Winona Ryder as Elizabeth Taylor).<br />This book may be a little advanced for makeup artists who are just starting out, but hey, makeup is art, and art is about ideas, so it's definitely worth checking out.  For anyone who is just plain interested in fashion and style, &quot;Face Forward&quot; will be intriguing, even if only for the skill exhibited in transforming one famous face into another.  It's a masterpiece.	2001-01-15
US	52944303	R306SDSXCIZDEQ	1893554090	643613111	The Long March: How the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s Changed America	Books	4	63	68	N	N	Excellently written (though biased) chronicle of the 60's	I'm old enough to remember a little of what went on politically and culturally in the 1960's, but too young to be conversant when it comes to the noted writers, activists and others who set the tone for the &quot;revolution&quot; that took place toward the end of the postwar baby boom.  To me, &quot;The Long March&quot; served as a great documentary introduction to this time period that changed the social agenda for many.<br />Roger Kimball is a conservative who can't stand the influence of the 1960's (actually, the late 50's through the early 70's) in creating what he calls the &quot;liberal establishment&quot; that evolved from that era.  His book is a superbly written (and yes, conservatively biased) account of the progression of thought and activism through a little more than a decade, spurred on by a group of influential artists and &quot;avant-garde&quot; intellectuals of the time.  The author focuses primarily on the literary aspects of 60's radicalism, with a wealth of commentary on works by authors/poets such as Norman Mailer, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, Susan Sontag, Timothy Leary and Eldridge Cleaver.  In addition, Mr. Kimball chronicles the activism involving the Black Panthers and the student revolts at Berkeley, Cornell and Yale Universities.<br />Most of Mr. Kimball's efforts are aimed at trashing quotes (literary or otherwise) by every guru that happened to hold sway over the 60's youth and associated political/social &quot;counterculture.&quot;  I must say, he does a good job of it.  He possesses a wonderful way of taking what at the time were much revered literature and speechmaking, and turning them into the most inane, irresponsible drivel one has ever read or heard.  The author is particularly unfriendly to pacifists, riot inciters, and advocates of unrestrained sex, drug use, and rock music.  Okay, rock 'n' roll ruled, but my views aren't far off from his on the other issues.<br />What impressed me the most about this book was the author's erudite, witty narrative and his command of the English language.  Even though I have no time to get stressed out over what happened 30-40 years ago, I thought this was a great read.  That Mr. Kimball's views are right up the conservative alley might leave you either very pleased or horribly distressed.  If you happen to think highly of people such as Mailer, Sontag, Leary, Cleaver, or even Tom Hayden, you won't be happy with this book.  For others, note the perspective, keep an open mind, and enjoy reading.	2001-01-03

Among author John Slatter's nine &quot;fundamental truths&quot; listed therein:  As investments, anything else besides common stock is &quot;inferior,&quot; &quot;Don't buy mutual funds,&quot; and &quot;Don't ask anyone for advice.&quot;  As an investment professional, I would see danger ahead for many who choose to follow such investing tenets.  I should add that, on the subject of advice, Mr. Slatter DOES encourage contacting his firm (phone number provided) in the event that you have at least $250,000 and you happen to disobey the thing about advice mentioned above.  In case you don't fit in with the author's target [investing] audience, take a couple grains of salt right there.<br />The remainder of Part I contains basic terminology, some palatable commentary about analysis, information sources, etc., and a &quot;defense&quot; of Mr. Slatter's strategy of holding mostly common stocks with the remainder in money markets.  Many might take exception (I do) to the recommendations against asset allocation as well as the author's abhorrence of mutual funds and bonds.  In my opinion, these are questionable premises, especially for the beginning investor.<br />Part II, the latter 90% of the book, has very good write-ups on what the author feels are the 100 best companies in which to own stock.  I would suggest using this part ONLY for familiarizing yourself with specific market sectors and general business trends, with the understanding that much of the year 2000 had NOT yet occurred when this was written, thus rendering the historical information--and company-specific prognostications--largely obsolete.  More grains of salt.<br />It should be understood that the investment viewpoint held in this book is just one of many; there are good arguments for investment strategies that run contrary to the author's philosophy.  On the subject of picking stocks, I'd recommend using Value Line or another publication which updates stock selection data/advice far more frequently.  If it weren't for the good company profiles in this book, I'd skip it altogether.	2000-12-30

There are ten chapters, with essays featuring the interplay between Ms. Vienne's delightfully quirky perspectives on modern society and anecdotes of a historic/scientific nature.  Each chapter is augmented by a list of &quot;keepsake&quot; words of wisdom, and interspersed with great sepia duotone photos by her daughter Jeanne Lipsey (whose contributions have taken over impressively from those of Erica Lennard in the first two books).<br />While Ms. Vienne offers quite a collection of poignant things to say about aging, her style of wit--that of melding scientific explanations with downright funny comments about how we go about our lives--seemed much more humorous when dealing with our foibles and goofy mannerisms than it does with the more serious topic of growing older.  It appears like the author is striving to show us how our younger years weren't as good as we thought, and how &quot;aging&quot; really means &quot;arriving,&quot; &quot;knowing,&quot; &quot;succeeding,&quot; etc.  In other words, the experiences we had when we were young pale in comparison to what we're going through now.  True for many, but I, for one, feel blessed by the formative years of childhood through early adulthood, and never want to forget these times.  Maybe aging doesn't bug me as much as it does others (perhaps I don't feel old enough yet!).  Oh, and on the subject of &quot;being yourself,&quot; Ms. Vienne's writing shines much more brightly in &quot;The Art of Imperfection,&quot; my favorite of her &quot;Art&quot; books to date. <br />Overall, there are lots of likeable thoughts in this book.  The chapter on &quot;The Art of Laughing,&quot; followed by the Mae West quotes, is a classic.  The photography is fantastic ... again.  For many readers, this book will be of some comfort, plus a nice source for passing words of wisdom concerning adulthood and aging to your family and friends.  As for me, I don't think I was in the target audience this time around.	2000-12-27
US	52944303	R2RB7QBGEK6XCF	006098709X	947326254	Think a Second Time	Books	4	75	83	N	N	Highly recommended; great perspectives on current events	After reading &quot;Happiness is a Serious Problem,&quot; which I enjoyed immensely, I felt compelled to look into Dennis Prager's ideas concerning a number of other interesting topics.  In more ways than one, &quot;Think a Second Time&quot; has much to offer one who loves to delve into controversial topics.<br />In my opinion, Mr. Prager is a superb thinker and an excellent writer who has a gift for expounding on social and political issues from a perspective other than our typical &quot;knee jerk&quot; reaction elicited by the media.  I applaud the way he exposes issues and counters conventional wisdom (read &quot;bias&quot;) with sound logic and philosophical acumen.  At other times, however, he can be a little too forceful in his convictions as they relate to matters of [his] faith and religion.  That's good for him, surely, but in my opinion it occasionally knocks the flow of this book out of kilter.<br />The 47 chapters in this book are divided into four parts with different themes.  The first part, which is superb, deals with human nature, gender differences, family issues and the media.<br />Part Two, also excellent, gets a little heavier, and discusses political (e.g., liberalism vs. conservatism), racial and religious issues.  Check out the chapter on television news.<br />Part Three deals almost entirely with ethical monotheism (i.e., the belief in one God from whom emanates one morality) and its association with the &quot;good vs. evil&quot; dilemma.  This is where you might get bogged down with the author's passionate Jewish convictions.  I didn't come across anything totally eye opening here, but I did find the references to Hebrew writings to be somewhat interesting.<br />Part Four (which I believe was added into the latest edition) deals entirely with the 1995 State of Illinois Supreme Court decision involving &quot;Baby Richard,&quot; who was taken from his adoptive family and given over to his biological father after four years.  I hadn't followedthis case before, and I found it interesting and well-written.  If you don't care to read about major court proceedings, stop after Part Three. <br />Overall, I enjoyed the way Mr. Prager gets me to think (more than a second time) about a slew of important philosophical, ethical and religious issues.  On that basis, I give this book a big thumbs up.  Cut out Part Three, which was too much of a deviation, and you'd have a 5-star rating.	2000-12-25

It's not overly analytical, and there is much more here than the &quot;I'm OK; you're OK&quot; theme.  I would recommend this book to anyone.<br />In just ten short chapters, Ms. Vienne employs great wit, clever mataphors, and strikingly up-to-date commentary about how we should be celebrating the gap between the ideal for which we are striving and the reality of our true selves.  A great example of some witty incongruity comes from a chapter entitled &quot;The Art of Having Nothing to Wear.&quot;  &quot;Think about it this way: Radiocarbon in fabric has a half-life of 5,730 years--give or take 40 years.  The style of an outfit is subjective, elusive, and volatile, with a half-life of less than two months.&quot;  I have to applaud a writer who can link science and fashion in such an ingenious manner.<br />Rather than being overly analytical, this book creates an ART (key word) out of what somebody, somewhere, thinks are our shortcomings.  Among other topics, the chapters touch on the acceptability of being shy, disorganized, or silly (my specialty).  The &quot;un&quot;-this, the &quot;not&quot;-that or the &quot;dis&quot;-whatever parts of ourselves really aren't so bad if we view life's contents from a less serious, more quirky perspective.  Cultivate a weed, and sooner or later you'll get a flower out of it.  A famous actress (Elizabeth Taylor, I think) once said that a face is not beautiful without flaws.  Ms. Vienne is telling us that, given a lemon, we can make ... lemon soufflé!<br />As in the previous &quot;The Art of Doing Nothing,&quot; Ms. Lennard's sepia duotone photos provide a tranquil beauty that offsets, yet complements, the spirited tone of this book.  The &quot;art&quot; in this book will grow on you.	2000-12-24

Whereas Dennis Prager (e.g., &quot;Think a Second Time&quot;) might offer us a thinking person's gourmet buffet, Ms. Vienne serves the hors d'oeuvres: they're excellent, and you can make a whole meal.  In ten concise chapters, she has brought forth some of the most poignant ideas and insights on topics such as procrastinating, napping, listening and waiting.  The imagery she evokes through her use of situational examples is quite up-to-date in terms of our everyday routines.  Rather humorous; very true.  You'll recognize yourself in almost every chapter.  My only [minor] criticism is that, on occasion, the author strays a tiny bit too far into biological explanations (e.g., what happens at the molecular level when we breathe), which bogs down the flow of the writing.  I skimmed through those parts the second time around.<br />While there are numerous stress-reducing techniques offered by the author, I don't prefer to read this as a &quot;how-to&quot; book.  For me, just taking a step back and looking at how frazzled our lives are gives me a much needed attitude adjustment and sense of relief.  The sepia duotone photos by Erica Lennard cover many subjects, are first-rate, and appear on almost every other page.  I was also happy to find a nice list of photo credits at the back of the book.  If I hadn't already read one of Ms. Vienne's other books (&quot;The Art of Imperfection&quot;), which I liked even better, I would have given this one five stars.	2000-12-23

For me, this book is not so much of a &quot;repair manual,&quot; as it is one of the most insightful, succinctly written books on how happiness is linked to human nature, philosophy, morals, temperament and values.<br />Mr. Prager writes:  &quot;The greatest battle for happiness is with our own nature.&quot;  If we can look inward and understand our drives and the intrinsic characteristics of what it means to be human, we then can use our intellect, spirituality and relationships with others to develop a stronger affinity for happiness.  Or, perhaps, create in happiness an affinity for us.<br />The author divides the book into three parts consisting of thirty-one chapters.  If read from front to back, the book flows nicely from &quot;Premises&quot; to &quot;Major Obstacles...&quot; to &quot;Attitudes and Behaviors That are Essential to Happiness.&quot;  What I especially like is that the individual chapters stand alone, and are great for highlighting the author's views on very specific issues and problems.  The most interesting ones deal with the dilemma between happiness and fun, the problems with expectations, and the preponderance of victimhood in today's world.  Prager has some profound views on these, and many other topics.  He makes you think.<br />Overall, &quot;Happiness...&quot; turned out to be enlightening and quite easy to read (you won't need a dictionary by your side).  I'd rank it at the top of my list (also check out &quot;When Bad Things Happen to Good People&quot;) of books dealing with life's disappointments and successes, emotion and human nature.	2000-11-27

Following are overviews of 46 airport and terminal projects, with interesting and easy-to-understand descriptions of the problems overcome in each design process, structural considerations and noteworthy aesthetic features for each airport.<br />This is a book written for architects by an architect, as evidenced by the wealth of plans, elevations, model views, artist renderings and computer-generated perspectives.  Each airport/terminal project takes up between two and ten pages (Denver International gets the most), including text, photos and illustrations.  The most superb photographs are the large color ones which show innovative roof and ceiling concepts, exterior perspectives, and exquisite interior spaces formed by glass and structural elements.<br />Aside from being enjoyable to read, the book is well-constructed and printed on quality paper.	2000-11-17

Oprah liked this book; I was disappointed.<br />The story begins with a young woman starting a new job at a real estate company.  She then meets a dashing (of course) young man who has also just begun working there.  There is courtship, they fall in love, she gets pregnant, they go over their heads on a home purchase, then they get married.  You are now on page fifty; six hundred more to go.<br />Ms. Binchy's story-telling reminds me of those theaters built in castle-like homes where you can walk around from room to room and follow different actors as the events unfold:  there's intrigue in every chamber, but you can only wonder what's going on elsewhere in the house.  With this book, you can be in many places at once, and that's the key to becoming absorbed in what turns out to be one giant soap opera.<br />Outside of a few key people, the author is not big on character development, instead relying on dialogue to give the reader what I'd call &quot;personality likenesses.&quot;  With respect to the &quot;flowing Irish writing style&quot; that some talk about, I must have missed the flow.  I had to struggle to make it to the last third of the book, where all the juicy stuff becomes known, and all the characters pretty much get what they deserve.  The message:  the sincere and steadfast grow, the deceivers wither, the naughty people cause lots of heartache, and we're all amazed by the turn of events along the way.  No revelation there.	2000-11-13

To me, it's a perfect scaled-down blend between the &quot;Resorts &amp; Great Hotels&quot; and &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; magazines.  There are 34 &quot;gems&quot; in this book, each portrayed in four to eight pages of text and gorgeous photographs.  The back of the book contains an excellent section of factual information (e.g., rooms, facilities, activities, location), plus a map of France pinpointing the location of each hotel.<br />I wouldn't necessarily use this book as a travel planning tool unless I had lots of time and was expecting to cover lots of territory.  There are probably more than 34 hotels just in the Latin Quarter of Paris, so taking this number within all of France doesn't make for useful comparisons.  Also, there are no rate listings for any of the hotels, but I'd guess that the term &quot;upscale&quot; would fairly describe the price, as it surely does the quality of the properties.<br />Still, for those who enjoy superb photography, or who wish to get an introduction to France's beauty, or who might REALLY go on a dream vacation, this is a wonderful book.  If I were rating this with my heart and eyes only, it would be 5 stars.	2000-11-05

This book, named after one of the  questions received on the website, is a good, mildly entertaining  compilation of &quot;gee whiz&quot; trivia and interesting historical  facts.<br />The book's twenty chapters (History, Food, Language, Science,  etc.) contain answers to 127 questions selected by Mr. McLain from website  inquiries.  While this number may seem small, each question has a response  of several paragraphs, followed by related &quot;Factoids,&quot; then  several more paragraphs of &quot;Did You Know?&quot; trivia, which may or  may not be worthwhile information depending on your interest level.   Eloquent prose does not abound, but I found almost all of the topics in  this book to be interesting enough for me to hope that the author tries it  again with a second volume.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I wasn't  as turned off by the goofy asides that follow the questions.  The inclusion  of dozens of websites pertaining to specialty topics was a BIG plus, in my  opinion.<br />If you're a trivia buff, or just love to spend time reading  about how everything got to be the way it is, I would recommend adding this  book to your collection.  However, there are others of its type that are  more comprehensive, and perhaps more interesting.  Be careful when  cross-checking the answers with those found in other references:  I found  it a little disconcerting that they contained either different or more  wide-ranging answers to similar questions (e.g., &quot;mind your p's and  q's&quot;).  Still, I'm glad Mr. McLain took the time to translate the fun  aspects of his job into this enjoyable book.<br />[If I was the parent of a  junior high or high school student, I'd buy this book as a gift.   Worthwhile websites . . . hint, hint!]	2000-08-27

Yet, I'm torn.  I really do like this book, but it could have offered so  much more.<br />&quot;Visionaire #28: The Bible,&quot; contains 41 images  (e.g., photos, paintings, graphics) pertaining to verses of the Bible,  submitted by over 40 artistic contributors.  Each image takes up the left  and right side of the opened page, complemented by the Biblical chapter,  verse and text; the title of the work; and credits for the artist, stylist,  model, etc.  The book looks like a big, white Bible with gold-edged, stiff,  cardboard-like pages.<br />I must say, there is good deal of striking imagery  in here, especially &quot;The Annunciation&quot; (Gregory Crewdson),  &quot;No Room at the Inn&quot; (Mary Ellen Mark), &quot;Mother and  Child&quot; (Jean-Paul Goude), &quot;Salome and John the Baptist&quot;  (Andres Serrano), and &quot;The Ascension&quot; (Raymond Meier).  Other  notables include works by Lagerfeld, Testino and Meisel.  There are also  several excellent paintings and computer-generated graphics.<br />Given the  magnitude and importance of the Bible, this book could easily contain twice  as much art.  Also, with over half the pages dedicated to the books of  Genesis, Luke and Revelations, I feel a little shortchanged knowing how  much Biblical history was left out.  I truly believe there was a great deal  more artistic &quot;fun to be had&quot; that Visionaire #28 passed up.<br />Of  the two Visionaire books I've studied, I like this one much better, even  though packaging and collector's novelty weigh just as heavily (they  shouldn't) as artistic merit.  I may sound overly critical, but a 5-Star  art/photo book has to have &quot;wow factor&quot; on almost every page.   This is a good effort, but falls short of a top rating.<br />[Note that I  didn't mention the price]	2000-07-15
US	52944303	RRGO288PJCSIZ	0425169871	381696390	Firebird	Books	4	12	13	N	N	A wonderful love story from a new author	Janice Graham is off to a great start with this enjoyable love story.  If you're expecting a tale of heavy romance, deceit, murder and a multitude of convoluted sub-plots, you won't find much in this book.  Instead, one man's  love, almost like a prairie fire, starts in one place, is blown to another,  and is rekindled in yet a third as relationships grow and transform over  time.<br />This story shows how death can be a rebirth (remember that title),  and how loving a daughter can be as profound as loving a woman.  Love's  complications lead to grave happenstance; then maturity, enlightenment, and  ultimately a deeper love, are born from tragedy.  Happens in real life,  too.<br />I'm not the type to dwell on hidden meanings or decipher twists in  the plot.  So instead, I like to let myself be led wherever the story  points.  In that regard, this book was perfect for me.  Yeah, maybe Ms.  Graham isn't the world's best at epic storytelling and character  development, but the people in this book are pretty strong nevertheless,  with the drama really picking up toward the end.  And, maybe the Kansas  prairie is a little over-glamorized, but there's a great image there.   These would be but minor criticisms rather than major detractors.  The  story flows well, is easy to read, and you'll identify with all the  personalities right away.  I enjoyed this book immensely, and finished it  in only two days (a rare occurrence for me).<br />Start reading, get into the  flow, and you will be moved by this story.  I recommend it highly.	2000-07-15
US	52944303	R2KZHVUAJYEPDU	3908247144	418028451	Juergen Teller Go-Sees	Books	5	18	18	N	N	A simple concept results in a fascinating photo journal	The term &quot;go-see&quot; refers to a certain photo encounter whereby an aspiring model hooks up with a photographer, with the understanding that neither one has a specified commission for the session's work.  The model,  also called a &quot;go-see,&quot; is hoping for the one gig to launch a  career; the photographer is hoping to discover the next new  &quot;face.&quot;<br />In a simplistic but strikingly revealing book, Juergen  Teller has chronicled just under a year's worth of &quot;go-sees&quot; with  over 460 photos taken in and around the entrance to his London apartment.  Each page has one picture (most often color), the date, and the name of the  model.  The book is quite heavy (literally) for its size, and is put  together with a high-quality cover, binding and paper.<br />It's easy to get  used to perusing books by the top fashion photographers showing the most  beautiful women, creative sets, perfect lighting, makeup, etc.  This book  is MUCH different.  I'm turning the pages one by one, looking at face after  face: so many walks of life . . . so much expectation . . . so much hope.  Who succeeded?  Who failed?  Even some famous models are in there.  Can you  find them?<br />With no set, no makeup, and no special lighting, I can't  envision Mr. Teller working very hard to get these shots.  It doesn't  matter.  The variation obtained through the diversity of position, angle,  expression, and even the weather, is fantastic.  Some of the girls posed,  and some hammed it up a little; others just stood there and gazed into the  camera.  And, what a metaphor the doorway is!  This book is a wonderful  alternative (and complement) to the high end of modeling and fashion  photography publications.	2000-07-12

I do that with this book far  too often . . . and I never regret it.  You can use &quot;Crazy  English&quot; as a reference if you like, but what author Richard Lederer  does best is make you chuckle at all the oddities of the English  language.<br />This book is literally (ha!) packed with word origins,  semantics, &quot;confused&quot; phrases, funny figures of speech, and even  categories of words I didn't even know had a name (the &quot;nyms&quot;).   The chapter about the doctor who speaks only in palindromes is a classic.   Lederer's wit plays right into the theme of the book, and I would bet he  had as much fun writing it as I have reading it.  No need to start at the  beginning; just open to any page and bounce around.  It's all great fun,  and easy reading.	2000-07-08

In &quot;When Bad Things Happen to  Good People,&quot; Rabbi Harold S. Kushner offers a refreshing point of  view that differs from those who think everything occurs on earth because  God wants it that way, and at the same time provides a surprising comfort  in the fact that events actually can, and do, take place for no reason at  all.<br />I read the original version of this book in the early 80's (several  times since), and what struck me was that Rabbi Kushner was able to  reconcile a common Judeo-Christian view of God and causality with a  perspective of life that holds a place for randomness and happenstance.   Yes!  Things happen in life that God has nothing to do with, and there is a  way to find peace in accepting this.  For those who enjoy contemplating and  discussing the purpose of life, faith, and good &amp; bad, you MUST read  this book . . . then set aside some more time for thought and  conversation.<br />If you've ever experienced the untimely loss of a loved  one, or been through any traumatizing life experience, get this book.  It  is personal, thought-provoking, well-written, and very easy to understand.   I am certain you will find comfort.<br />If you're just simply interested in  learing about God and the meaning of things in your life from a wonderful  man and a great writer, get this book.  Without intending to write a  best-seller (read his Preface), Rabbi Kushner was able to put into words  what I had been trying to figure out (despite loads of &quot;help&quot;  from others) concerning God, how we should relate to Him, and what to do  about all the things that happen to us during our lives.<br />This book is  important; I give it my highest recommendation.	2000-07-07

Aside from the huge listing of films, there are numerous cross references that serve as an efficient  guide as well as a valuable resource for cinemafiles.  My favorite is the  alphabetical listing of actors/actresses, because I often can't remember a  movie title, but can remember who was in it.  You know how that is.<br />As  far as the reviews go, I'm not so picky.  Opinions are opinions, and I'm  more concerned with the plot, presentation and straight movie facts, rather  than who thinks what film is good or not.  The individual film listings go  way beyond director and key actors.  Even less-than-star players get a  mention, as well as the director, writer, cinematographer, and  composer/lyricist.  Also included is a listing of all the nominations and  awards a film received.  Although I wouldn't necessary delve that deeply to  learn about movies unless I was trying out for Jeopardy, the information is  interesting nevertheless.<br />In comparison to the 1999 guide, there are two  deletions in the 2000 edition that keep me from giving this a 5-star  rating: 1) the foreign film index, to which I referred quite often last  year; and 2) the &quot;content warning&quot; description, which, while not  the determining factor as to what movie I rent, is still useful to me.  I  hope this information re-appears in subsequent editions.<br />All in all, this  guide is a worthwhile purchase, and the space is reserved under my TV for  the 2001 edition.	2000-06-23

Sante d'Orazio shot them all, and presents them here in a very clever collage of a photo diary spanning from 1985 to 1997.  Mixed among the shots which made it to  publication in the world's top fashion magazines is a wide array of  attitude poses, candid moments, playful outtakes, and perhaps even a couple  of photographic bloopers.  What draws me to this book is the imagery of  whirlwind travel, all-night parties, and romping photo sessions, contained  in a just-thrown-together scrapbook fashion augmented by airplane tickets,  foreign currency, watercolor painting and cryptic hand-written notes by the  photographer himself.  This guy leads a fun life, and has the pictures to  prove it.<br />If you like models, you'll love this book, and  d'Orazio's nude  photos--some raw, some refined--are excellent.  Sometimes it's hard to tell  whether he snuck up on somebody, or if the setting was planned;  nevertheless, it's all a blast.  I'm intrigued by the picture of Kate Moss  sitting sideways in an empty tub, smoking a cigarette and reading a book  entitled &quot;Help Your Husband Get Ahead.&quot;  <br />The presentation of  randomly-ordered contrasting moods--prim versus toussled, serene versus  crazy, color versus black &amp; white, staged versus candid--gives this  book a variety that, to me, stays fresh and interesting.  The b/w's  outnumber the color shots, and are far better, in my opinion.  I always  appreciate a subject/date/locale photo index, which can be found in the  back, although one must hunt through the thumbnail pix to find a specific  shot because there are no page numbers anywhere.  This book would be  perfect if the format was slightly larger, and if the photos (i.e., events)  were in chronological order, so as to catch the natural flow of a diary;  however, these are only minor detractions.  Keep flipping the pages . . .  and enjoy.	2000-06-20
US	52944303	R3F5UUCAN37B0Q	0528841254	396786740	Rand McNally 2000 Road Atlas: United States, Canada, Mexico (Rand Mcnally Road Atlas)	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Excellent presentation; informative travel reference	Being employed where many maps are kept, I always make sure I have one of these around.  I picked the Rand McNally atlas upon consideration of  these important features: 1) the state maps must have enough color and  contrast to be able to make instant distinctions between the different  roads and highways, as well as municipal boundaries; 2) inset maps for the  cities should depict major attractions, buildings and monuments, and  indicate one-way streets in the downtown area; 3) driving distances, scale  of miles, and a clear legend should appear alongside each state map; 4) the  index of counties, cities and towns should be located separately from the  maps, so as give more room for state/city maps on the main pages; and 5)  inset maps of National Parks should also be included.  The Rand McNally  atlas has all of these features, plus other bonuses I like: state-by-state  auto rules, with important phone numbers; good overall maps of the U.S. and  Canada, with time zones; and even a map of telephone area codes.  My only  criticism is that the map of Mexico should cover two pages instead of one,  but this is not enough to reduce the top rating.	2000-06-18
US	52944303	R2B7WKYY3DW12C	0812931866	804704318	The Day Traders: The Untold Story of the Extreme Investors and How They Changed Wall Street Forever	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Informative, well-researched and entertaining	If you're thinking of becoming a day trader, this book is not a &quot;how to&quot; manual, but it's a good start, providing some invaluable insight into the personalities and forces at work in the world of electronic stock  trading.  Author Gregory Millman uses the term &quot;extreme&quot; to refer  to day traders, much in the same way as we might categorize those athletes  who master balance and gravity-defying acts to achieve a sporting  &quot;rush&quot; beyond that achieved by professionals in the mainstream  sports.  Look upon the successful day trader in the same light as the  skateboarder who had to fall thousands of times prior to succeeding in the  X-Games.  The only difference is that the skateboarder is more likely to  make it big.<br />Millman has talked to the true movers and shakers in the  field, and relies on some great behind-the-scenes research and his  experience in writing for numerous financial publications, to bring us a  book that is at once a history lesson, an eye into a day trading &quot;boot  camp,&quot; and even a test kit for the reader to see if he or she is fit  (financially, emotionally, etc.) for what may turn out to be the investing  (gambling?) craze of the new millennium.<br />This book is easy to read and  quite captivating.  Whether or not you're a broker, a  &quot;buy-and-hold&quot; investor, a gambler, or just plain intrigued by  what all those playing in the stock market seem to be talking (i.e.,  bragging) about at parties these days, you will enjoy this book.  Even the  Electronic Traders Association risk disclosure statement was interesting!   Millman's style is smooth, and won't trip you up with dry details or  obscure jargon.  I read this in just a few hours; can't wait for his next  one.	2000-06-13

In the case of &quot;Visionaire 29: Woman,&quot; I'm reluctant to even put it on my coffee table.  The allure of this book stems from its  being a one-of-a-series, limited edition (only 6000 printed) publication.   Other plusses are its high quality paper, velvet cover and the really cool,  mirrored presentation case.<br />What's between the covers turned out to be a  disappointment for me. [Note: #29 is the only &quot;Visionaire&quot; book  I've seen, so I can't make a comparison to the others].  There are about  100 pages of mostly photos (both color and b/w, many nudes) with a couple  of paintings, sketches, etc., included.  About 70 people were listed as  contributors.<br />While some of the photos are interesting, beauty does not  abound here (try instead: &quot;Photographs&quot; by Patrick Demarchelier).   Noteworthy are the photos by Karl Lagerfield, Peter Lindbergh (of Madonna)  and Marcus Piggott/Matt Alas.  What I don't relish looking at are pictures  of a sex doll with its face slashed, a nude torso with nasty cosmetic  surgery scars, or some overly back-lit stills from a stairway video  installation.  There's also a photo of a cat nursing her kittens  (&quot;woman&quot;?).  Okay, so if the subject matter isn't always  charming, maybe there's supposed to be a theme or message to this  compilation of art.  I couldn't find one.<br />If you're a collector of rare,  trendy photo books, it might be worth your while to plunk down the steep  price for this.  But, in my opinion, the bad outweighs the good here.	2000-01-30

I've been an investment professional since 1988, and this is the most borrowed book on my shelf.  I also owned the previous  edition, and this version has been improved with the inclusion of rates  down to 2% and the expansion of loan amounts to $300,000 in the primary  table.<br />The book is conveniently organized in four tables, ordered from  most-commonly to least-commonly used (as it happens, largest to smallest).   Table 1 (monthly amortization) is where everyone spends the most time.   Just turn to the interest rate page, then read across for &quot;loan  amount&quot; and down for &quot;years in term,&quot; and you've got your  monthly payment to the penny.  For non-round numbered loan amounts, you can  avoid having to interpolate by grabbing a calculator and turning to Table 2  (required payments for monthly, quarterly, etc.), where you can look up the  multiplier (per $1000) corresponding to the rate and term of a given loan  (yep, that's how your mortgage lender does the math).  Less frequently used  are loan progress charts and proration data, Tables 3 and 4,  respectively.<br />This book is straightforward, convenient, and travels well.   My favorite of its kind.	2000-01-29

Dunnan employs a simple, easy-to-read style in compiling an investment sourcebook that serves simultaneously as a &quot;how-to&quot;  manual and a reference guide, without implying that the reader is some kind  of dummy.<br />Each of the 36 chapters contains easy to understand, practical  information interspersed with helpful hints and cautionary asides (denoted  by a checked box and a little cannonball bomb, respectively) that add a  clever dimension to the financial discourse.  What impresses me most about  this book is that Dunnan has no bias (unlike other noteworthy publications)  when it comes to the topic of investment advice and fees.  She provides  encouragement and insight as to how to get the most out of your own  efforts, if you feel comfortable on your own, or out of your investment  professional, if you don't.  Topics range from beginning to complex  investment vehicles, choosing financial professionals, financing major  purchases, on-line investing, and considerations related to insurance and  retirement.  There's even a chapter on the tax status of your investments,  arranged alphabetically by subject.  All throughout, there are numerous  listings of alternative information sources (e.g., organizations and  publications) to bolster your education.  In the back of the book you'll  find a decent glossary (conspicuously absent in other books) of Wall Street  jargon.  Unless your goal is to day-trade, this book is for everyone who  has a question involving the world of money and investments.	2000-01-27
US	52944303	R1HQ9CK15ZWRN8	0821221698	117773957	Patrick Demarchelier: Photographs	Books	5	30	30	N	N	A masterpiece from a prominent fashion photographer	With this wonderful depiction of form and expression, Demarchelier shows his mastery of presenting the face, the body, and the mood through an  incredible feel for lighting and contrast.  His adeptness at capturing the  nude female form brings out incredible beauty without the slightest hint of  pornography.<br />What you get: 82 black-and-white photographic plates, most  of which are formatted to fill the entire page.  With a few exceptions, all  were taken from the late-80s to the mid-90s, and about half were taken from  fashion magazines or designer ads.  Most are of people, the majority of  whom are recognizable (to me) celebrities.  About one-forth feature the  nude or semi-nude female body.  For good measure, a couple pictues  featuring members of the Demarchelier family are also included.  All  photographs are presented &quot;stand-alone,&quot; with no notes or  credits; however, this information is clearly referenced at the back of the  book.<br />What you see: a straightforwardness of subject matter.  Where other  photographers might dazzle by snaring a moment in time from an event (e.g.,  Robert Doisneau), Demarchelier presents his subjects with no mystery as to  what the viewer is to behold: the intricacies of the baobab branches in  contrast to its massive trunk; the variations in lighting between two  figures, one illuminated, one silhouetted, seated in front of a window; or  the calm, confident gaze of Christy Turlington wearing only a tangle of wet  hair, and a sheet around her hips.  The side-by-side photos of Helena  Christensen are perhaps the best of her ever, as may be the one of  Turlington.  Not to forget the face: the shots of Versace, César,  Corbassière and Nastassja Kinski are absolute gems.  I'm having a hard time  puting this book down, and I'd love to know who that is hanging from the  tree on the front cover.	2000-01-26

After searching for  years, the Wissman book was a dream come true: something other than a  calendar that contained more than five Bouguereau works.  The presentation  here was well thought out, with the paintings grouped by subject/theme, and  the text therein describing chronologically the development of Bouguereau's  work.  I appreciated the link between the artist's life and the influence  of other artists and the art world at the time.  The artwork itself is  wonderfully portrayed, colorful and true, in almost all cases, the  exceptions being an occasional inconsistency in contrast or sharpness  (probably due to less-than-ideal photographic conditions were the paintings  are found).  I also applaud the inclusion of dimensions and location/credit  notes which accompany almost all of the paintings.  The only way to improve  upon this book would be to include even more of the artist's work, and make  it larger.	1999-11-20
