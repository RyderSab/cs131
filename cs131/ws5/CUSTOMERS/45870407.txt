When I picked up THE RISING, I was expecting a masterpiece, being that it carried with it so much hype. What I ended up getting was a solid old school zombie book with a few clever twists/treats thrown in.<br /><br />My expectations were lower this time for CITY OF THE DEAD. I figured it would be a simple, fun read, I should be able to experience some thrills...and besides, Keene managed to develop THE RISING's cast well enough so that I actully wanted to find out what happens to them in this.<br /><br />Well, I got much more out of this one. The blending of biblical mythology, frightening apocolyptic imagery, extreme splatterpunk gore, and action/adventure just sucked me right in and beat me silly with its rancid claws.<br /><br />The characters are taken to another level, as are the zombies (corpses invaded by djinn), and just about everything else you can think of.<br /><br />This is one all age groups should be able to appreciate. The older fans will likely consider this a \\"guilty pleasure,\\" while the younger ones should crap their pants and get those altars to Keene ready.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />A MUST READ FOR ALL HORROR FICTION FANS!	2005-07-14

A bit too long for its own good, SPIRIT does offer some unique perspectives on ghosts, but does so in a way that I found to be over-explained. The characters were well developed for the most part, but a bit too common, and the English sounded a bit too British at parts (takes place in the states).<br /><br />Other than the unique perspective on ghosts, there is nothing new here.<br /><br />The gory scenes were top notch, sure to please the hardcore horror freaks, and there were some creative killings which had me nodding right along.<br /><br />This is the first and only Masterton novel I've read, and will not be my last. Judging from his mastery of gore scenes, I'll be sure to pick up FEAST, which I've been told is one of the sickest novels ever written.<br /><br />Overall, a good, solid read.	2005-05-26

While the Joe Nassise stories ranged from so-so to great, every single story from Drew Williams was a winner.<br /><br />Williams displays an impressive variety of terror in this collection of short stories. Stories about two-headed chickens, a drive-in movie theatre that just won't die, a freaky video store, the end of the world, a freelance writer who...whoops, well I don't wanna spoil that one, succubi, and more!<br /><br />His style is perfect, he has the gift of being a natural storyteller coupled with the insights and knowledge of the genre, which puts him in the tier of the elite. Always a pleasure to read his work!<br /><br />Joe Nassise came up with a few hum-dingers as well, like the awsome \\"CARRION MAN,\\" but I found the dialouge in some of his pieces to be a bit corny, and some of the stories a bit contrived. Still, worth reading.<br /><br />Overall, I highly reccomend that all horror fans check out Drew Williams' work. I have not met one person familiar with his work who has not spoken as highly of it as I am now.<br /><br />Semi-complaint: There were more than several typos throughout (mostly in Nassise's stories)which doesn't usually bother me, but when it is a rather short book, I expect better editing than this. But that is nit-picking. This is a keeper.	2005-03-10

While this one didn't cause me to stand up and whistle, it did make for a fine read.<br /><br />It starts off with a bang as a maniac, along with his two naive highschool-aged friends, kill two girls who are camping. The story then jumps four years ahead and follows the mainac, Ray, and his two friends, and the cop who knows Ray is guilty, and is still trying to nail him.<br /><br />The first half was great, then it slowed down a little with a seemingly pointless subplot involving the cop's cat. Then the ending is an all-out...well, I don't want to spoil it, but whoo-wee!<br /><br />Well-written, albeit not super original, fans of suspense thrillers should enjoy this.	2005-03-10

Since most of Little's charcters are cardboard to begin with, he was defintly the one to write this story about anyonimity.<br /><br />It is about Bob Jones, a man who is so average, that even his not-so-average life experiences are average. He begins working for a giant corporation, Automated Interface, and soon discovers that his problem is much greater than merely not being noticed-- he's become downright ignored, invisible almost.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first half of this book which was a poignant portrait of a man...of a nobody.<br /><br />The second half is entertaining, but becomes quite silly. Bob is sooon discovered by a group of fellow ignored aka TERRORISTS FOR THE COMMON MAN, and they set out to make a difference.<br /><br />I found the ending to be rather clever. Sure there are some holes in the story, like how does an ignored woman, going into labor, find a non-ignored doctor to deliver? But that's besides the point. This book is a commentary, and it is Bentley Little, whose stories tend to be rather \\"out there,\\" so it's best not to over scrutinize it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very entertaining read. I thought it would've been better had he made the second half a sequal, but hey, still worth reading. Not your everyday fare.	2005-01-23

An underground horror writer making his mass-publication debut with a \\"serious literature\\" mystery suspense/novel?!<br /><br />\\"No way,\\" I thought.<br /><br />Well, instincts aren't always right. With MIDNIGHT RAIN, James Newman puts the others to shame. This is one of the most unpretentious, sincere, and enjoyable books I have read in a while.<br /><br />The first hand narration of Kyle Mackey, recalling his life as a 12-year old who had the misfortune of being the sole witness to a heinous murder, takes the reader to Midnight, NC circa 1975.<br /><br />Kyle Mackey, an unassuming, sensitive boy takes his bike to his \\"secret spot,\\" an abandoned shack in the middle of the woods. It is there he witnesses a gruesome murder. A mystery follows, as Kyle finds not only is there noone he can confide in, but things are not as they seem. A poignant tale of the loss of innocence is woven in.<br /><br />That's as far as I'll go with the plot. I'd like to proclaim James Newman as a major player in the realm of fiction. His sheer story telling talent is obvious throughout, the charcters are real, the tone is consistent, this is just a hard one to put down. This is what fiction is all about-- entertainment without cheating the reader. There is no \\"literary snobbiness\\" here, just a born storyteller doing what he does best.<br /><br />A MUST-READ for all mystery/suspense, and even horror fans!	2004-12-19

With all the publicity you'd think he's come up with some revolutionary novel, one that will set the standards for the next 10-15 years, one that will cause LOVECRAFT and POE to rise from their graves, one that will grace a poster in your public library...<br /><br />Forget the hype, this is just good 'ol fashioned, gory, 80's style horror. Granted, he does come up with some pretty unique zombies (they can haul, drive cars, fire m-16s, and make some funny one-liners), and in the beginning of this zombie rampage he explains their origin, which I wish he would've spent more time on.<br /><br />THE RISING starts out with a bang. Our main man, Jim is in his bomb shelter in good 'ol West Virginia, keeping an eye on all of the undead who are messing up his lawn. He gets a call from his kid on his cell from his kid in (gasp) New Jersey, and decides he needs to go on a rescue mission. Along the way he hooks up with an African American preacher (my favorite character), a drug addict prostitute, a scientist, a deaf kid and a bunch of military scum. The meat of this book is the gore, there are some ghastly scenes described within these pages that are not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />Half way through, I was treating this like a bad, albeit fun 80's style b-movie, but somewhere along the way, Keene earned my trust, and I began to get into the characters, and when all was said and done, I wanted more, which, to me is the mark of a good writer. Forget all the snobby standards they tell you in school, just use my basis, and you'll know your right from your left.<br /><br />Anyways, I look forward to the sequal, which I believe is THE CITY OF THE DEAD. If you are into ROMERO, FULCI and/or 28 DAYS LATER (which shares similar bits of social commentary, in that it is showing us what a military run state could do), then you will appreciate this.<br /><br />For Horror Fans Only!ould do), then you will appreciate this.   <br /> <br />For Horror Fans Only!	2004-11-22

Finished it in two sittings!<br /><br />I'm going to take a stab at summarizing this masterpiece for you without spoilers, so here it goes:<br /><br />Two young men work at a morgue, loading stiffs into \\"Bony Express\\" (the name of the car that transports dead bodies from the scene to the morgue). One of these fine young able bodied men has a thing for collecting souvenirs off the bodies (knick-knacks like hairpins, hearing aides, etc). The other man seems pretty normal, but it just so happens that everytime he looks into a mirror, he sees this red-haired chick with black eyes screaming.<br /><br />I'm going to stop for fear that if I go on, I may end up putting a cramp in the ride. All you need to know is that it is very well-written (I'm talking like \\"stephen King,\\" well-written); it scared the $^%#^ out of me, has some brutal twists, conjures up some Lovecraft-ish imagagery, and is one of the best horror stories I've read this year.<br /><br />Have I gone mad, or is North Carolina becoming \\"the state\\" of the best horror writers? (Scott Nicholson, Drew Williams, Stephanie Simpson-Woods) Ah, who cares? Just keep churning out the gore, doesn't matter where it came from.	2004-09-06

While this one does not quite match \\"The Association\\" or \\"The Collection\\", it does come pretty close.<br /><br />Some reviewers whine that the story is not believable, well, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT!? Don't you read the back before you buy, or at least some excerpts? Bentley Little novels are exaggerated, and poke fun at many institutions that we take for granted like the POstal Service, INsurance Companies, Corporate America, Homeowner Associations, etc.<br /><br />To be sure, the story does have some flaws. I didn't understand what was up with the haunted guestroom, and I can't believe that they never consider calling in the FEDS on this company, but, this is Bentley Little, and his world is twisted, reality is bended...he takes you on a wild ride.<br /><br />There is one scene that nearly made me puke, involving a baby being delivered by a doctor in a cherub mask...you'll know what I mean once you get there...brace yourself!<br /><br />The \\"good guy\\" characters, as usual are just your average joes, the villian(s) really stand out, I thought Little's wicked gung-ho insurance agent was freaky.<br /><br />This one is worth checking out by all horror fans who have a sense of humor.	2004-09-03

NO, this is not \\"literature\\", when I pick up a Bentley Little novel or short story, I expect a whacky premise, gore, social satire, and an exaggerated view of life. Obviously, \\"The Mailman\\" is no exception. A mail-carrier who is actually some demonic creature begins messing with a small town, this mail carrier actually performs some weird ritual which incorporates the \\"mailman anthem,\\" (not rain nor sleet...), it is just plain fun horror fiction, and go ahead and look down your nose at me, but I'll take a Little novel over an Ann Rice novel any day.<br /><br />I highly reccomend, \\"The Association,\\" and \\"The Collection\\" as well.	2004-08-30

It starts off great, switching back and forth through time, causing the reader to grow anxious. Unfortunatly, the second half turns into a lame, not-well-thought out blunder. This is not like the other Litle books I've read (The Association, The Mailman, and The Collection). His other books hooked me by displaying hilarious social satire, political incorrectness, weirdness, and extreme gore. In this one; however, it seems as though he wanted to pull off a  &quot;serious&quot; horror novel, and in the process he kind of lost his identity.<br />I hope that he continues to progress, but by sticking to his original formula of satire and inconcevable weirdness.<br />It is still worth a read, as long as you don't pick it up with high expectations.	2004-05-03

A man who has to relocate his work and home to another side of town because of a highway project, begins acting strange, and slowly loses his grip, and becomes &quot;unplanted.&quot;<br />The character development is so rich that it is scary. Those who are strict adhereers to the horror genre may not get much out of this, but those who enjoy fiction in general, and who have an appreciation for the subtle details which make for a complete literary experience, will want to indulge in this poignant world of anti-progression.	2004-03-30

This, his first written in English, should be read by all mystery/crime novel lovers. Starts out in Havana, a Cuban English teacher (of part North American desent), who is rather indifferent towrds the revolution, is contacted by an American who says he has been paid 9k to bring this teacher to Miami. The plan is set, but half way there, our friend is pushed off the boat, and left for the sharks. There begins the drama and mystery.<br />Don't worry, I did not spoil anything, there is so much that happens in this novel. It did become a tad bit inconcevable towards the end, for that I knocked off one star. But it is an entertaining read, and was quite enlightening in regards to Cuba.	2004-03-03

It is about a writer who visits different &quot;haunted places&quot; and spends the night in them, and then writes about it. 1408 (add the digits and you get, 13)refers to the hotel room number of a seriously haunted room. The way he describes...well, just trust me, it is like the Stephen King of old (before he got paid per word). Some other great ones include, &quot;The Road Virus Heads North&quot;, &quot;That saying that you can only say in French&quot;, &quot;lunch at Gotham cafe&quot;, &quot;Autopsy room 4&quot; and &quot;Everythings Eventual.&quot;<br />Also, the introduction he gives is interesting as he goes into the art of writing a short story and his opinion of the current state of short stories in general.<br />Also it is noteworthy to know that there is a Dark Tower tie-in (the sisters of euluria). There are a couple of duds (Lucky Quarter and Riding The Bullet), but it does not matter, as the ones I mentioned earlier totally make up for the stinkers.	2004-01-29

In this, his sophomore effort, however, I found many of the characters to be annoying (like the &quot;damn california yankee&quot; Dewalt, who keeps having these annoying mental conversations with himself). Although I like the idea of introducing the whole town to us a la Salem's Lot, I just did not find it necessary in this one. Since this is a theme that has been done a million times (The Blob, INvasion of the body snatchers, Tommyknockes, Dreamcatcher, etc.) I was really hoping for a unique angle, but instead was left with a feeling of, oh.<br />Yes, the setting is charming, and some of the charcters are interesting (like James, the young, well educated black man who experiences the racist treatment from the rednecks, and Chester the old hillbilly who is constantly looking for free time to enjoy his moonshine), and it was written well enough so that I couldn't put it down.<br />Judging from how good his 1st novel was, (and apparently his book of short stories is great as well) and the fact that this one does have something to it, I would say that this is merely a so-so work from a potentially great horror writer. I do sense some early King, Barker, Laymon and even some Lovecraft (especially in Red Church)in him, and I still am eager to read his next release, The Manor which is scheduled to be released in Sept '04. So there you have it.	2004-01-29

But it's hard to deny that this is probably his most wickedly terrifying novel to date. An upper class lawyer's wife, chained to a bed, out in the middle of nowhere is forced to face her past. All the while, the sound of a chainsaw is heard in the distance, and a starving dog enters the house. She is hearing voices in her head, she thinks she sees an awful looking man in the shadowed corner, staring at her. There was one part in particular that grossed me out (it's towards the end, you'll see when you get there). Also, this is one of the best endings that King has ever come up with. It wrapped up nicely, not leaving me with any questions or doubts.<br />If you are into psycological horror, and are not bothered by the sexual content, then give this one a try. Chau.	2003-12-20

I didn't expect Warlock to exceed it,and it doesn't, but even still, it is a damn good book. Taita is enigmatic as ever (and has become \\"one with nature\\" from wondering for years in the wilderness) and has such a powerful presence that he has earned himself the distinguished honor of being my second favorite character of all time (behind Sinuhe from \\"The Egyptian\\"). Mintaka (the hyksosian princess)replaces Lostris as the beautiful,charming and intelligent heroine. Nefer (the young pharoah) is all but a splitting image of his grandfather, and Naja & Trok (and Ishtar) provide some serious hellraising as the usurpers.<br /> As with River God, the reader is transported back through time to the 14th dynasty. Wilbur Smith is so descriptive (without boring the reader)that you will be able to feel the sand grains in your eyes, hear the flowing of the nile and feel how the common Egyptians felt regarding their leaders. The plot, which contains plenty of planning, cunning and deceit, unfolds beautifully. The story is action packed, adventurous and loaded with gruesomely gory scenes, and some rather steamy sex scenes are thrown in as well. Readers with weak stomachs are to be cautioned because there are several scenes which would make Stephen King cringe. Overall, this is an exciting action packed love story, set in ancient Egypt during the years of the Hyksos, written by an excellent story teller with a special knack for detail. There you have it.	2003-12-17

Little's take is exaggerated, weird, sick, outrageously over the top, satiracle and just plain fun.<br />We're talking about a group of older men who worship article 90 in the ccr handbook, who murder children, minorities and gays. An association that can watch your every move, that dictates not only which color you may or may not paint your house with, but that dictates who your friends are, how you are allowed to wear your hair, etc.<br />There are some gruesome butchery scenes described as well, and some loveable characters, like Stumpy, the limbless man who lives in the forest.<br />If you are familiar with Bentley Little, then I need say no more. If you are not, well all I can say is that you will most likely either love or hate him. His stories are extremely exaggerated, gory and full of satire. If you are easily offended, then you'll do well to avoid his works. If you happen to enjoy stories about talking macaroni, crazy James Dean cults and Wicked gated communities, then give his stuff a try, you'll be in for a treat.	2003-09-30

Well, I am sure glad that I continued.<br />There are some brilliant pieces in here. Short stories are not easy to write, but Little has truly mastered the art. &quot;The Washingtonians&quot;, &quot;Estoppel&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot; to name just a few are exactly what I want from a short story- characters who seem real after one paragraph, a seductive plot, suspense, emotion, originality, well constructed sentences and entertainment.<br />My advice is to read at least the first five stories, if you still find it dispicable, then I'm a bonehead, and my reviews are to be avoided at all costs. If you find yourself drawn in and captivated, then you are in for a ride on one of the most twisted and macabre imaginations that was smart enough to put it's works down on paper and get published.	2003-07-12

Wilbur Smith es el mejor autor que conozco para describir escenas de accion, de veras todas las batallas son escritas de una manera tan emocionante que me puse a sudar varias veces.<br />Lei este libro en ingles, apenas vi que los hispano hablantes tambien tienen la opurtunidad leer este tesoro. ya.	2003-05-11

This one (Jancis Robinson's) however is good for people like myself who already know the basics (the distinguishing characteristics of grape varieties, the main regions, how to make reasonablly good food/wine pairings, etc.)<br />In other words, it's not the easiest book to follow.<br />Another note- she makes her disgust of Spanish wines known in the opening paragraph on page 222 when she says \\"If it (Spain) had Germany's love of efficiency, or France's respect for bureaucracy, Spain might be sending us oceans of judiciously priced wine made expressly for the international market. But Spain is an anarchic jumble of districts and regions...and heartbreakingly awful human constructions, and has to be treated as such by the wine enthusiast.\\"<br />I found those comments to be misleading, as Spain to me is a model exporter of high quality wines. Just about any Rioja or Tempranillo wine imported and that goes for less than $...is of fine quality. That is my opinion of course. Another semi-complaint is that there was not enough material on Argentina (only 6 paragraphs) which I found to be a shame, since Argentina has very unique and delicious wines.<br />Overall this is good, as I said earlier, for those who already have a basic knowledge.	2003-05-05

Although I don't usually get into this particular genere, I was drawn to the characters. Parts of this actually brought tears to my eyes, which isn't all that surprising I guess, considering I balled like a baby during Bambi, Life Is Beautiful, Talk To Her, etc. Anyways,<br />IF YOU HAVEN\\"T READ THIS YET PLEASE DON'T READ ANY FURTHER FOR I AM ABOUT TO SPOIL SOME CRUCIAL PARTS OF THE STORY<br />but I have to get this off my chest; at the end when Katie sees that Suzannes gravestone says 1999, katie then apparently realizes that Matt was not having an affair, but rather had already lost his wife, but earlier Suzzane had pointed out in the diary that Matt had already been published as a poet, which means that he had already known Katie, which means that they had already slept together, right? That confused me, in fact I am still a bit confused, was he cheating on Suzanne, or no? If someone can explain this to me, I'd greatly appreciate it.<br />Thanks.	2003-03-07

This was my first exposure to Wilbur Smith's work, and I was most impressed.<br />The story is narrarated by Taita, a eunuch slave, during the mysterious 14th dynasty of Egypt. He writes about his adventures, accomplishments, thoughts, and feelings throughout. The battle descriptions are exciting and very believable, Wilbur Smith holds back no detail whatsoever, which means that this may not be the best choice for those who have a qweezy stomach. There are some brutally gory parts, which made my face twist more than a few times.<br />Some of the reviewers have criticized the fact that Taita seems like a superhuman because of his accomplishments in so many diverse fields like astronomy, prophecy, architecture, medicine, engineering, etc. Well, let me say this- He was bought at a young age from the nobelest of the nobles in Egypt, therefore he became familiar with all the mannerisms of the educated, and had access to the educational materials of the time. Also he was a eunuch, so he was not distracted as most men are by raging hormones, etc. Add that to his natural intelligence, and remember that back then people probably tended to exagarate their feats more so than now, and you have a rather believable character.<br />Once again, this is an excellent read, packed with history, action/adventure, and romance. Also check out The Egyptian by Mika Waltari, which is the best ever.	2003-01-15
US	45870407	R1TRCEMYISYSTA	0805054081	156310833	The Book of Illusions: A Novel	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Well Written	This is a good piece of drama/mystery. The way that Auster made up and described old silent films was quite entertaining, it's almost like reading several short stories. It made me want to go out and watch some silent flicks.<br />In a nutshell this is about a man who writes a book about an Argentine actor in the silent era, who one day just disappeared without a trace. Then he recieves a letter one day saying that this actor is alive and wants to meet him.<br />I won't say anything else, except that this was very well written, and was hard for me to put down.	2002-12-02

Out of the 4 Stephen King books that I've read (pet semetary, thinner, salems lot), this one is now my fave. This is a very disturbing story about a girl who is an outcast, large in part due to her religiously fanatic mother. She is often the center of jokes and harassment by her peers, and..well we all know how this one ends.<br />Let me say that this is much better than the movie. All the extra detail that this contains, and the graphic descriptions, make this worth the read.	2002-12-02

A very suspensful book, that conjures some genuinly scary moments. I love the way King made the town seem so real, and the main charachters have real depth.<br />BE FOREWARNED...reading this alone at night, may cause nightmares, and/or stubbed toes as you go to check to make sure there are no vampires hovering outside your window.	2002-09-29

Also the story and the plot are interesting.<br />This is about a fat lawyer who runs over an old Gypsy woman, and is then let off by a womanizing judge and a police chief. Our fat friend is then tracked down by the woman's very elderly gypsy father, and is cursed by him. I won't reveal what else happens, except that he loses alot of weight.<br />Books are very personal to each of us, and to me this one just did not have characters that I could relate with. They are all pretty sleezy. The ending also was also kind of lame in my opinion. Still, this was an easy read, and I must admit that I was entertained. So there you have it.	2002-08-15

This is a great book to purchase if you want to check out different writers in the &quot;weird&quot; genre. Some of them, like &quot;Personal Wishes&quot; are actually rather uplifting, while ones like &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; are more disturbing. But the coolest one so far (I still have a few more to go) has been &quot;Folk Lure&quot; which was unique (although this one among others has nothing to do with vampires). For 7$ you can't go wrong, if you like this type of read, then I'm sure you'll find at least 8 great stories in this one.	2002-07-16

These poems were originally published anoymously, then finally were released under nerudas name. Although these poems were written about his not so ideal marriage with Matilde Urrutia, they have different meaning for me. If you appreciate poetry, well then you are in for a treat with this one.	2002-05-30

No me gusta hablar mal de ninguna religion, sin embargo yo s&iacute; creo que es bien importante saber todos los hechos de una religion, y buscar aquellos hechos de varias fuentes. Este libro se trata de Los Testigos de Jehov&aacute; por un ex miembro que era parte de su &quot;Cuerpo Gobernante&quot; (Un director).<br />Este Franz tiene una manera de relatar los sucesos usando hechos probados como cartas y libros, lo cual da confianza al lector. Qued&eacute; soprendido ver que atravez del libro mantiene un respeto hac&iacute;a la organizaci&oacute;n, a pesar de lo que le hicieron.<br />Yo no tengo una religion, pero si me gusta saber y conocer lo que creen la gente. Despu&eacute;s de haber leido este y tambien libros de los Testigos, yo no creo que son malos como muchos dicen, mas bien, vine a la conclusion de que cuando uno junta con una religion que tiene miembros elevados que hagan las decisiones de lo que vas a creer...hay que investigar.	2002-04-09

Now that I'm done I'd like to say that this is the greatest story that I have ever or probably ever will read.<br />I won't reveal much, but I will tell you that it is about an Egyptian physcian who is exiled and he writes his life story in which he describes his dealings with the Pharaohs and foreign kings, and there is lots of murder, adventure, sex, pondering, religion, politics, drama, humor. This book really is just about life in general, it makes you think. Give it a try!!	2002-02-11

Se trata de Sinuhe, un doctor egipcio exiliado que escribe su vida, desde su nacimiento humilde hasta que llegue a atender los faraones. Este libro te hace pensar, te hace llorar, te hace reir, &iexcl;lo tiene todo! Ademas, esta basado sobre hechos reales. El autor tuvo mas de 10 a&ntilde;os estudiando la historia de Egipcio y los rollos de Sinuhe. Es interesante notar que a pesar del hecho que la historia trata de sucesos que pasaran hace unos 3.000 a&ntilde;os, nosotros podemos identificarnos con todo. Espero que todo el mundo tenga el privilegio de leer esta obra maestra. (Este repaso se refiere al &quot;The Egyptian&quot;, lo cual es la misma historia, pero en ingles.)	2002-02-11

I find that this book has been the center of all my conversations lately, and I am only just over 1/4 of the way through this! The opening chapter which consists of 8 paragraphs is the best opening ever, &quot;I, sinuhe, the son of ...write this. I do not write it to the glory of the gods in the land of Kem, for I am weary of the gods, nor to the glory of the Pharaohs...For my own sake I write this; and herein I differ from all other writers, past and to come.&quot; <br />It is obvious that the author took alot of time and care to study ancient Egypt in order to understand the surroundings, the culture, history, etc. And I can't believe that this was written in the 40's...it sounds even ahead of our time! Also as a translator I  want to say that this was written in Finnish, but one cannot tell, the translation is remarkable!!<br />The whole world should read this masterpiece!	2001-12-21

The reason I bought this book, is I wanted them to describe the ending better than what I saw in the movie. Well in this book they leave off with Davidson leaving the planet of the apes and mentions nothing of his making it back to earth like it shows in the movie. So that is the only reason I would not reccomend this book, otherwise I really enjoyed it as it not only depicts the movie accurately, it goes beyond by describing the characters emotions and the thoughts. Oh well....you be the judge.	2001-11-16

I did not find this helpful as at the time I read this I was looking for the truth. It seems that they are taking facts and craftily twisting them to support the arguments presented. They want you to think that anyone who is a Mormon,Jehovah's witness,etc is being decieved and is gullable.<br />One thing that people fail to realize is that there are many members within these religions as in almost any that have  benefited because of their religion's teachings and are happy people. I don't think any of the religions mentioned in this book are &quot;cults&quot;. The writers should have saved all that research for something worthwhile.	2001-10-31
