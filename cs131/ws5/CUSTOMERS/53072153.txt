While this book contains some interesting facts and is useful as a reference for those marketers that may want to have some facts at their fingertips for making tactical decisions or to use in presentation to management, the argument is not convincing.  First and foremost, every good marketer knows that advertising is only part of the mix, as is P.R. And, a good marketing communications &quot;buy&quot; includes direct, out of home, sales support, point of sale, etc. etc.  Further, you can't buy PR.  Journalists are justifiably aware of product pitches and know a good story when they see one.  When Ries suggests that getting PR is as simple as buying advertising he falls down in his argument.  Buy the book if you need the facts.  This is not a brilliant marketing text.	2002-09-15

The beauty of this book on Paris is that there is information on the culture, the cuisine, the history, the art, with a small, very small section on hotels and restaurants.  This is not just a great book to prepare you for your trip to Paris, this is a book for a student of the city.	2002-07-20

I loved this book.  While I have been out of wedding photography for a few years, this book got me back in with a new, inspired vision.  Not only does she cover the basics of how to shoot a great, realistic wedding, she discusses marketing, bridal shows, how to assemble an album, pricing, and equipment.  Every one of her photos carries the camera type, lens used, film used and other details.  Here's a hint even if you don't buy the book.  Keep an antique wedding album in your display at bridal shows.  How could you better communicate the value of photography with that kind of display.	2002-07-08

Married 8 years, Lena was continually questioning why she viewed the world in certain ways while others couldn't see things the same way.  The insights in this book got her thinking about what was special in her Swedish upbringing and why she was taught to look at some subjects differently.  Reward systems, her acceptance of certain conflicts and her questioning mind were revealed to her as a result of reading this book.  Since then, I have purchased an additional copy to share with a colleague recently hired by a Swedish company and Lena has given her Dad a copy.  A must read for both Swedes and Americans who interact with Swedish people.	2002-07-08

After reading this book about what's in my Happy Meal I will never eat at a fast food restaurant again.  Schlosser is a great investigative reporter and, in my opinion, this book rivals the Upton Sinclair novels I read in high school. While the profiles of the beef and potatoe industry were both frightening and revealing, the real value to me was the change in the American diet that has occurred as a result of this industry.  The increase in the amount of sugar consumed in the U.S. was enough to make me change my dietary habits forever!!	2002-07-08

I like cookbooks, find food interesting, and buy cookbooks just to think about how the recipes taste.  I found this book on the best seller list and enjoyed reading it immensely.  It is the story of a now-famous foodtv critique who, in very easy to read, fast reading style makes the life of a chef much less glamorous than those who appear on the shows.  While there are plenty of conflicts, hyjinx with the staff and a career spanning at least a dozen restaurants, there is also some interesting information that might just change your order the next time you go into a restaurant.	2002-07-08

This edition is no exception and I'm glad that I bought it.  In addition to the totally updated and revised case histories that I always find fascinating, Mr. Kotler has integrated a great deal of information on the new economy and electronic technologies throughout the book.  From CRM to e-commerce, he has again provided a roadmap for the professional marketer.  I found the section on marketing planning and how to integrate the internet into your branding and marketing plans to be extremely effective. New charts throughout each section as well as new sidebar features called \\"Marketing Insight\\" and \\"Marketing for the Millenium\\" make the book even more valuable.	2001-03-21

I liked the book for the insight I believe I received into Chinese society, thinking and view of relationships.  Even though fiction, I felt special in reading this book.  I felt as if I knew the characters, could understand their very oriental motivations and could appreciate the beautiful analogies and words that describe the situations and the characters' reactions.  I feel that Ha Jin has enhanced my understanding of a great many things as a result of reading his fiction.	2000-11-29

This book is not for the typical tourist but for the individual interested in an in-depth look at the city of Chicago. He digs to get the best out of every subject he covers and in very descriptive text and references, gives even the most experienced Chicago visitor and even resident a taste for almost 100 subjects.  Listed alphabetically, are a myriad of aspects of the city from architecture and astrology, to almost any subject you can imagine.  This is not a typical tour book but one which will entice you to investigate areas of interest and the city that you may not have imagined exist.  The author is opinionated and frank, which makes the book even more useful.	2000-10-24

So, when I was assigned to Chicago to open a new business, I bought a few guides, this was one of them.  While not intended to be an absolutely complete guidebook (ala the Fodors gold series) it does a good job of listing the top restaurants (by cuisine), top hotels (by price) top entertainment spots (by type) and top 25 sights to see.  I especially liked the brevity of this feature because it helped me focus on the most important museums , entertainment and other features of the city.  Every listing has a location, nearest mass transit stop, and map coordinates that match the city map that is included with the package.  If you're looking for a simple but very useful guide, this is the one.	2000-10-24

While partially a fairytale, this trio of novels about beauty are erotic fiction with the passion that Rice creates in her vampires -- only in this series with regard to beauty.  Bondage, whipping and the feel of the passion between a man and a woman is thoroughly engrossing in this trio.  Don't expect the mystery of the vampire series.  Expect instead the mental passion that you feel when Lestat finds and seizes his victims.	2000-10-24

In this selection of case histories by a group of a group of professors from Western Ontario, various aspects of e-commerce stories are covered.  Both product and service stories as well as ISPs, payment methods and other categories are a good start on the many good commerce ventures that have broken ground.  The cases are covered in a good, logical fashion, well written and well illustrated.  I only wish that they had included more about mistakes made, as well as risks and rewards of the business in general	2000-10-06

It was nicely organized, the restaurant reviews, descriptions and things to  do were all very helpful.  In addition, as a result of using this guide I  found some architectural gems in two neighborhoods not normally frequented  by tourists and the walks I took around these two locations gave me a  better sense of Toronto history and heritage.  There are maps throughout  the book so I was able to take advantage of Toronto in bite-sized pieces  rather than referring back and forth to some master map located inside the  covers.	2000-08-23

The concept is solid marketing and echoes the corporate or, perhaps, venture business axiom that  &quot;we really loved this project when it was a dream!&quot;  And, who  doesn't?  This book gives us all practical knowledge about how to take our  businesses from that small, little known phase of early adopters and get on  the mainstream engine by crossing the chasm between those of us who are  destined to remain a small business to one in which we really grow and  proper and make our dream a reality in the mainstream	2000-07-25

The biographical information on the chef, the facts about what sells best in his famous NYC  shop as well as the organization of items is simply fantastic.  Even though  the first one I baked was the &quot;banana cake&quot; it was actually  banana bread with a great variation.

Many of the \\"to-do\\" lists in self-help books are useful, I found this book an internal to-do list.  Instead of outward activities that many books  ask you to partitipate in to make progress, this author advises looking to  your most inner thoughts, your dreams, your conscience, in order to find  what you really want out of life.  It works. Listen to your quiet moments,  pay more attention to your third sense and record the things that occur in  your dreams. There is a direct relationship between all of these thoughts  and the things that will make you happiest. Interesting thought in the book  ... \\"What did you want to do when you were seven?\\"  Think about  it and the level of satisfaction you are getting our of life now.	2000-06-11

I can't think of a more enjoyable source of weekend r&amp;r than taking one of the  trails suggested in this book.  There are good suggestions for ability, the  maps are adequate, and the directions to the start of the trail are clear.  The only thing I'd add to this book is an online link for printable maps so  I don't have to take the book (although pocketable) along.

Although I really enjoyed the  sections on preferred epuipment and lighting, I paarticularly liked a  secion of the book that included 10 self assignments to enhance your photo  skills.  These are assignments much like those that you might receive as a  travel photographer or even photojournalist -- all intended to achieve the  ultimate goal of creating an incredible portfolio of work.

I usually buy four to six  guides per trip but the guide that I relied on for my trip to Madrid last  month made my trip very, very enjoyable.  The new Knopf City Guides are  nicely organized and color coded to meet the travelers most sought after  needs.  Where to stay, eat, shop, see sights, enjoy night life are cross  referenced and expertly mapped.  Not only do they stick to their view of  the highlights but each of the sections make it easy to find other  attractions outside the section of interest.  For instance, the micro map  views in the shopping section also contained numbered,colored references to  the after hours and eating sections.  I would highly recommend these guides  to anyone visiting the cities covered.	1998-10-08
