I find that the three *New Talmudic Readings* serve as a continuation of the *Nine Talmudic Readings*, at least insofar as the readings and lectures which comprise Levinas's *Nine Talmudic Readings* were all delivered in the 1960s and early 1970s, and the *New Talmudic Readings*, not surprisingly given the title, were presented in 1974, 1988, and 1989. It should not be forgotten that these two sets of Talmudic readings and lectures are not all that is there - Levinas offers no less than five more Talmudic readings in *Beyond the Verse*. There is, as should be expected, much overlap in the style and format of Levinas's teachings. So, if my arithmetic is correct, we have 9 + 3 + 5 = 17 Talmudic readings by Levinas; although I might go further to claim that, in a large part, Levinas's oeuvre (both philosophical and religious) is one sustained and comprehensive Talmudic reading, or a midrash on Torah.	2005-09-30

In *Basic Writings of Nietzsche,* the editor, Walter Kaufmann, has selected five of Nietzsche's volumes (*The Birth of Tragedy,* *Beyond Good and Evil,* *On the Genealogy of Morals,* *The Case of Wagner,* and *Ecce Homo*) which touch on aspects of Nietzsche's overall trajectory. Also included are selections from *Human, All-Too Human,* *Mixed Opinions and Maxims,* *The Wanderer and His Shadow,* *The Dawn,* and *The Gay Science.*<br /><br />Kaufmann is not ashamed to refer the reader to his own works on Nietzsche, especially *Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist* and his edited *The Portable Nietzsche*, which contains the full-texts of *Thus Spoke Zarathustra,* *Twilight of the Idols,* *The Anti-Christ,* *Nietzsche Contra Wagner,* and miscellaneous, yet relevant shorter excerpts, essays, and letters.<br /><br />Together, these two edited collections offer the reader a full-scope introduction to the life, thought, and writings of Friedrich Nietzsche, a genuine master of criticism and insight.	2005-08-11

You're white.\\" This is a phrase that I have heard all too often. I do critical race theory _because_ I am white. It needs to be done. White people are \\"colored\\" too. We need to awaken to our history of racial privilege and false neutrality in terms of racialization. In Yancy's White on White/Black on Black, philosophical-critical race theory is being done very well.<br /><br />While the book description is correct in observing that \\"White on White/Black on Black is a unique contribution to the philosophy of race,\\" the text also serves as a key \\"philosophical\\" intervention onto the scene of Critical Whiteness Studies. Along with the groundbreaking works of David Roediger and David Theo Goldberg, one half of this text is written by white scholars on their experiences of whiteness. Chapters of note include those by Robert Bernasconi, a well known existential philosopher of race, and Bettina Bergo, a deft scholar and translator of Levinas and Merleau-Ponty.<br /><br />The other half of this text is, as can now be expected by Yancy's editorial mastery, brilliant. The Black scholars' contributions to this volume, especially those by Johnson, Birt, and Alston, offer critical engagements in the discipline known as Critical Race Theory, a domain mistaken as an area specifically reserved for critical legal scholars and American historians and sociologists.<br /><br />If George Yancy has shown us one thing throughout his editorial and scholarly career, it is that Critical Race Theory, bereft of a robust philosophical dimension, is moribund.	2005-05-09

His first major original manuscript after his dissertation on Husserl's theory of intuition, _Existence and Existents_, would not appear until 1947, and the lectures collected and published as _Time and the Other_ not until 1948, so the publication of this text should prove to be indispensable to English-reading audiences who have interests in Levinas' (early) work, as well as that of twentieth century Continental European philosophy. Here traditionally accepted phenomenological and existential concepts are introduced, studied, and discussed, such as the following: ontological Being, existents (beings), the identity of the self, the lived-body, radical finitude, etc.<br /><br />The human subject, which modern philosophy has argued is dual in nature, no longer wishes to escape its existence, its Being; rather it seeks to be \\"delivered\\" or \\"deneutralized\\" from the world (47). As he concludes _Existence and Existents_, Levinas will later seek a way out of the there is (il y a), and discovers it in the concept of the hypostasis. One must go beyond Being to actualize this point. Philosophy, traditionally accepted, has not thought through the implications of such a task. Throughout history, philosophers have been too concerned with beings. Heidegger introduced the ontological distinction, and began teaching us to (re)think Being. Levinas now wishes to help us think through and beyond Being to get to the ethical relation to, and the infinite responsibility for, the absolute Other -- the other human being.<br /><br />[for a longer review, go to: [...]	2004-08-13

Insofar as whiteness as a philosophical concept is to be analyzed and critiqued, Yancy's text makes an interesting move by viewing and unveiling the ideologies of whiteness and white privilege via African-American philosophical perspectives (Whiteness Studies, while enjoying an interdisciplinarity which includes history, sociology, and legal theory, has not been explicitly thematized by philosophers until now).<br />The introduction by Yancy, and the chapters by Charles Mills, Lewis Gordon, Robert Birt, Clevis Headley, and Paget Henry are most revealing and intriguing pieces of philosophical literature.<br />Overall, this text signals a critical moment in the development of Africana thought, and I wholeheartedly agree with J. Everet Green's blurb on the back of the book when he says that this book is a &quot;philosophical treat.&quot;	2004-05-25

That is not to say that the essays here collected are no good. The new translation is self-avowedly more accurate to Levinas' French than the Lingis translation.<br />With the above proviso in mind, the five essays collected and published as _Humanism of the Other_ are wonderful representations of the radicality of Levinas' notions of ethics. Of particular is the essay &quot;No Identity.&quot; Students and scholars of Levinas in particular and Continental ethics in general are well served by being or becoming familiar with this work.<br />The introductory essay by Richard Cohen is very clear and worthy of a serious reading in its own right. Cohen is a top-notch Levinas scholar and translator.	2004-03-30

Schrag (emeritus, Purdue University), while a graduate student at Harvard in the 1950s, was Paul Tillich's assistant. He humorously observed that Tillich was considered by some narrow-minded academics to be a &quot;thinker, not a philosopher.&quot; _Love, Power, and Justice_, now celebrating its 50th birthday from original publication, is a short volume that integrates Tillich's passions in philosophy, especially existential thought, and Christian theology. The result is in an exciting synthesis of strands of 20th century thought.<br />I had long desired to do a careful read of this text, so I assigned it to my Ethics class. We went through it, chapter by chapter, and discussed the relevance of each of the volume's three major concepts to our core course concepts: philosophy, critical thinking, freedom, responsibility, and political justice. I believe that the text served its purpose quite well, and would use it again in a course. Teaching it gave me a deeper insight into the mind of Tillich as well as the important ethical concepts of love, power, and justice.	2004-01-05

The collection features a strong combination of established and classically-received scholars (Kant, DuBois, Nardal, Senghor, Sartre, Fanon) and many big-name contemporary scholars, such as Judith Butler, Linda Martin Alcoff, and Robert Gooding-Williams.<br />2. Bernasconi's inclusion of an updated translation of chapter five of Fanon's monumental existential-phenomenology of racialized experience, BLACK SKIN/WHITE MASKS (1952), &quot;The Lived Experience of the Black&quot; (correcting Charles Lam Markmann's mistranslation, &quot;The Fact of Blackness&quot;). This chapter is absolutely central for any and all critical explorations of race and racialized conscisousness.<br />Bernasconi's recent turn toward Continentalist perspectives on race and racism is not without controversy; however, even his critics would agree that the texts assembled in this volume are very important for the student and scholar alike.	2003-12-23

Schrag and the Task of Philosophy after Postmodernity_ is not only a fitting festschrift to one of America's leading voices in contemporary Continental European philosophy, but it is also an impressive collection of critical and philosophical essays in its own right.<br /> The introductory chapter by Gary Madison, &quot;Bringing Philosophy into the Twenty-First Century,&quot; contextualizes the essays that follow. Many of the essays are homages and salutes to Schrag, originally delivered at a one-day conference honoring the retirement of the renowned philosopher. All but two of the essays in this collection were presented to Schrag at this celebration, and his humbling, insightful and witty responses to the contributors conclude this volume.<br /> Of special interest are the essays by Edward S. Casey, Merold Westphal, Hwa Yol Jung, John D. Caputo, and Lenore Langsdorf, as they elaborate on and continue Schragean themes and notions.<br /> This volume serves as a wonderful backdrop to Schrag's latest offering, _God as Otherwise than Being: Toward a Semantics of the Gift_ (2002, Northwestern Univ.

Here Schrag makes a fitting return to his Kierkegaardian origins, and continues the discourse on the ethics of the &quot;gift&quot; shared by Marcel Mauss, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Marion, and others.	2003-07-08

Revised in 1989 with an  introduction by William Julius Wilson, and a foreword by Gunnar Myrdal, it is apparent that other scholars respect Clark's work as well. I was particularly impressed by the self-honesty of his methodology -- he calls it his &quot;involved observer&quot; method, which shows much more concern for the subjects of the study than traditional &quot;disinterested observer&quot; approaches, espoused by so-called &quot;value-free&quot; social scientists. Also recommended are other books by Clark, and most anything by Cornel West, Lewis R. Gordon, Allen Spear, and Alex Kotlowitz.

The late, great, Maurice Natanson, himself a student and friend of Alfred Schutz, was told by Schutz, &quot;Maybe you will discover that anonymity and death are the same.&quot; This profound thought underlies the entire text, as Natanson explores the causes and effects of anonymity (also called abstraction, typification, alienation, or as Dr.  Martin Luther King has called it, &quot;the darkness of nobody-ness&quot;).. Natanson reminds us that anonymity is not always a bad thing, but when it is instituted as a system upon unwilling participants, then it becomes problematic.<br />Also, I would recommend the work of Lewis R. Gordon, who adapts Schutz's and Natanson's theories of anonymity to discuss issues of antiblack racism and Africana thought. Gordon's &quot;Existentia Africana,&quot; &quot;Her Majesty's Other Children,&quot; and &quot;Fanon and the Crisis of European Man&quot; are suggested.	2000-10-24

His thorough reviews of the popular literature throughout the century give the introductory reader, as well as the seasoned scholar, a refresher of what's 'out there,' and how we may approach the issues with a fundamentally different and more humanistic way..<br />One section that impressed me in particular was his review of the history, actors involved, and suggestions brought  forth by Gunnar Myrdal's &quot;American Dilemma&quot; which broke new ground in both social science's approach to race, as well as the focus on the methodology of the social scientist.<br />This book, as mentioned above, is recommended reading for all students and scholars who have an interest in the  history of social science's treatement of the problems of the 'color line,' which DuBois explicitly states, which is the 'main problem of the 20th century.' If the 21st century is to be less violent and racist one, McKee's book is a good example of the necessary refocusing of a certain aspect  of the social reality - the issue of race/racism.	2000-10-13
