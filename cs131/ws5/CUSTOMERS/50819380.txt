Throughout history one can see the blood of Islam just as one can see that the writings of Koran call for these horrific acts on the infidels. (Any non-believer of Islam)<br /><br />However, Mr. Harris seems to have gotten more wrong than he has correct. He has transposed by logical error (guilt by association) that since Islam is a violent religion ALL religions must be violent. This of course goes against history and common sense.<br /><br />I posit a simple question when was the last time you saw a Hare Krishna blow themselves up?<br /><br />When was the last time you saw Billy Graham telling his audience to start a holy jihad?<br /><br />Oh and we all remember that scoundrel Gandhi and his band of marauding raiders, just set to rape and pillage our towns.<br /><br />And what about the Jews, hated by everybody including Mr. Harris who blames them and the Roman Catholic Church for the holocaust (100-107)!<br /><br />Reason and logic is not a strong point of the Sammy's polemic.<br /><br />What seems to escape the author is; just what is the common denominator behind some of the most murderous regimes in this world?

Johnston's use of statistics is very selective. And his source of those statistics shows his ideological bias. When analyzing GW's tax cut he uses progressive's think tanks numbers rather than relying on actual figures complied by the IRS and put out in the CBO report. If Mr. Johnston had used ACTUAL figures he would have found out that the tax cuts since 2001 increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners. INCREASED!<br /><br />It increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners, while decreasing the tax share of lower and middle-income groups.<br /><br />As an interesting comparison go back and read the CBO report about Clinton's draconian tax increase on the MIDDLE CLASS. It very clearly stated that lower and middle-income groups had their taxes RAISED disproportionately, while the top earners received little if any tax increase.<br /><br />Facts such as these are conveniently left out of his charts and graphs.<br /><br />In the end we must realize that the top 1 percent of earners paid 37% of all individual income taxes. The top 20% of earners pay 78% of all individual income taxes.<br /><br />And what about those poor souls who make up the BOTTOM 25% of taxpayers, they paid a whopping 1.1% of all federal income taxes.<br /><br />Here is an interesting fact to ponder:<br /><br />In 2001, AFTER the first Bush tax cut had taken effect, those in the bottom quintile paid average federal income taxes of 5.4 percent, about HALF of what they did 20 years ago.<br /><br />Taxes on the Rich have been rising while taxes on the poor have been decreasing. But wait a minute that is the opposite of what this book says. YUP, the only difference in the statistics is that the ones I have quoted have come direct from the IRS via the CBO. The author used sources that were biased already to prove his point.<br /><br />One last point is that the Johnson continually speaks of taxes as a zero sum game. This is patently false and is a ploy used by debaters on a losing side. If a millionaire cheats on his taxes and doesn't pay $ 10,000. The government loses this income. Johnston characterizes this throughout the book as the poor having to pay in an extra $ 10,000 to make up for this loss. This ploy is irritating throughout the book and as you can tell by several of the other reviews; this simplistic but utter false assessment can sway those of lower intelligence.last point is that the Johnson continually speaks of taxes as a zero sum game.

While, Pat has never been short on his ego, we can thank him single handily for the Bush's defeat to Clinton; this book shows some of the glaring mistakes that he makes.<br /><br />Before we attack the book, let's discuss what is correct about it. Nothing, no just kidding, Pat does an excellent job in warning us about this so-called free trade fiasco. The implications are of course that our hard industries (typical higher paying blue-collar jobs) are ripe for extinction. He also sounds the warning against the huge trade imbalance with China and posits that we are sacrificing short-term gains for huge long-term losses.<br /><br />Pat however, ignores the new information technology paradigm that is affecting the whole world. He also ignores historical evidence that countries who's political policies cause them to become isolationist virtually cease to exist. The UK, France, Spain, etc. would be prime examples. His speaking about the falling dollar is okay, just remember as the dollar falls our exports become cheaper to other countries and their imports more costly. This of course can be seen as a great stabilizing effect, unless as Pat opines, we are competing against a country, such as China, that keeps it currency artificially low.<br /><br />Chapter 9 is absolutely right on, and it shows how the judiciary branch, the branch that is supposed to be the weakest of the triturate government, has been taking a power grab. Pat believes that this is due to the fact that congress no longer wishes to make tough laws, while this may be true in part is also true that there are many judges, especially higher up that have<br /><br />Pat stumbles greatly when he shows his ignorance about Islam and the Palestinian conflict. One can only fathom that Pat seems to have been derived all of his information directly from Al-Jezzera & PLO news broadcasts.<br /><br />In summary, Pat's belief that if the USA would just be this little old isolationist country not bothering anybody, we would live on our little island paradise and nobody would care about us is absolutely ludicrous and in this day and age downright dangerous.uld just be this little old isolationist country not bothering anybody, we would live on our little island paradise and nobody would care about us is absolutely ludicrous and in this day and age downright dangerous.	2005-08-18

Life is not a cartoon	Ted Rall is a cartoonist and in way's we can say that he lives in a cartoon world. He very much wants to believe in the greatness of socialism, he wants to believe that everything good in this world has arrived from socialists and that everything bad comes from conservatives. Living a life like this is hard and causes one to make gross fabrications. To Mr. Rall superman, spider-man and wonder-women exist. But to us, slightly more well adjusted persons, we view these characters as fictionalized cartoons. Unfortunately Mr. Rall's book is that of cartoon-land so filled with these fabrications, that it really becomes a work of fiction.<br /><br />It goes without saying that from the-1940's - 1980's, America was pulled brutally to the left. The Conservative Party was weak and simply capitulated to the powerful democrats. During the 1980's the American people realized this country's slide toward socialism, they also began to see that the policies were failing miserably to create the supposed utopia of the left. So starting from the 1980's to current day the pendulum has begun to swing back towards the center. The problem though is that the center now has been moved so far left that the republican party of today appear more like the democrat party of the 1960,s. In essence we do have a one party system, Socialist party A or Socialist Party B. But there are still some differences.<br /><br />Rall doesn't quite understand that in our current situation, in which Democrats, whose domestic policy are carefully tailored to benefit a narrow socioeconomic segment of wealthy individuals, unions, lawyers and fringe special interest groups has become unpalatable to the average middle class American. Across the country, from California to New York, the hard leftist democratic candidates were unable to motivate their own base, let alone attract the center voters required to win close races. What Rall doesn't seem to get is that the Middle American doesn't view the Democrats as targeting the Republicans as opponents, instead the Democrats target America and the way of life that Middle America lives.<br /><br />For example, Teddy has himself in an uproar because of GW's tax cuts \\"that favor the rich\\" Unfortunately this hard-left mantra just isn't true. Anybody who has simple cognitive skills can reed the CBO report that was produced at the request of congressional Democrats. It confirms that tax cuts since 2001 increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners. INCREASED!<br /><br />It increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners, while decreasing the tax share of lower and middle-income groups.<br /><br />Hello, automata on the left, are you paying attention, go back and read the CBO report about Clinton's draconian tax increase on the MIDDLE CLASS. It very clearly stated that lower and middle-income groups had their taxes RAISED disproportionately, while the top earners received little if any tax increase.<br /><br />If you favor the middle class you have to vote republican, not for elitist billionaire candidates like Kerry, who would only hand out more favors to his fellow billionaires.<br /><br />Ted and his ilk are so out of touch with the average Middle American that this doesn't make sense to him. They don't understand that people don't like being lied to. The biggest problem is that Ted believes that you can say whatever you want, this doesn't work anymore. With today's access to information you can show a lie so quickly it just doesn't make sense to say one.<br /><br />For example, Ted lies about 2000 election on just about every count. First of all the state was called for gore 70 minutes before the polls closed in Florida. (Sorry Ted your lie that it was 10 minutes is patently false.) This early and fraudulent call was a concentrated effort by the liberal media to help disenfranchise the states voters. Democratic (yes, democratic) pollsters put the number of disenfranchised voters at between 10,000 - 15,000 that decided not to vote in the panhandle region. This, btw, is predominantly republican country.<br /><br />But what is even more appalling is that the exit polling by all major news outlets was showing that Bush was winning. The extent to what liberals will do to swing the vote unethically in their favor is atrocious.<br /><br />Gore's slide into win at any cost came quickly with his lawyers filling a petition to stop the counting of oversees military ballots. These ballots, btw, were never counted and added to the official total. Since most of them would have voted Bush and by counting the disenfranchised voters Bush easily won the state.<br /><br />Now remember, the only reason the Supreme Court got involved was because the socialist state judges refused the follow the law. Gore only wanted the most liberal of all counties to be counted, but the state rules said all the counties had to be recounted. The first Supreme Court decision was 9-0 the second was 7-2, both of these decisions said in effect that the whole state had to be recounted. Ted's argument that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction is merit-less, the presidential election is FEDERAL not a state election.<br /><br />In the end the state recounted the ballots 4 different times and in all 4 Bush one.<br /><br />Then a bunch of hard left media outlets got together at a cost of nearly $1 million bucks to try to PROVE that Gore won (NORC). Cartoon-boy tells us that \\"Media Consortium Statewide Count of `Undervotes' and `Overvotes' Proves Gore Won Under Any Standard.\\" (PAGE #)<br /><br />This statement is blatantly, undeniable False, a big fat Lie and you can download the NORC document yourself. The NORC reports that they recounted all of the votes using 9 different methodologies.

US	50819380	RQRODC26G8VW	1400040949	788802096	The Anatomy of Fascism	Books	2	9	27	N	N	The Anatomy of Historical Revisionism	This book is a pathetic example of a radical left-wing professor as he rewrites history and political thought before you very eyes. There are numerous errors throughout the book but probably the most egregious is the authors link of Fascism to the right wing. While this may be the political fantasy of any and all true socialists it is far from the truth. But let's get into the debate immediately and see if we can bring some Fact to this work of fiction.<br /><br />First of all the author incorrectly calls the German Nazi's a fascist party. This is so absurd that it is easily rebuffed here, but first let me give a little history. The term NAZI was a nickname given to the members of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Socialist is the operative word here.) This is of course Hitler's outfit, which formed the core of the Third Reich. National Socialists are just another variation on the theme of Socialism and they acquired their nickname though a cartoon character, \\"Ignaz\\", nicknamed \\"Nazi\\" who was the stereotypical Jew. Before the horror of the reality set in, it seemed a good joke on the posturing, parading, clearly anti-Semitic national socialists to share a nickname with a Jewish cartoon character. Later, Stalin thought up the switch of the applying the Italian \\"fascist\\" designation to German national socialist in order to erase from memory that the Nazis were, in fact, socialist.<br /><br />Fascist just for you information, refers to members of an Italian political party, founded and led by Benito Mussolini, who was expelled from the Socialist Party of Italy and went on to start his own. The structure was a copy, the concept a variant of other socialist parties. \\"Fasces,\\" a bundle of twigs with an ax, were carried before consuls of ancient Rome. Mussolini adopted the symbol, hence the name \\"fascist.\\"<br /><br />Other popular names of Socialist parties are Bolshevik's and Communists. It is interesting to note that in Hungary alone, the communist party went through four complete name changes during its tenure. It is an integral part of socialist operational methodology to make an instant switch once a label has been tainted with \\"mistakes\\" (such as too many atrocities), or when a new compendium of deceptions is about to be announced.<br /><br />Regardless of the name that a socialist party chooses they all have the same elements in common. They are as follows:<br /><br />1. Restriction of Individual Freedom<br />2. A strong central authority<br />3. The usurpation of legislative and judicial prerogative by the executive branch of the government<br />4. Some suspension of property rights.<br /><br />Since Hitler's party and the Mussolini's party both urged the people to go along with all four of the above premises, both the fascist and the Nazi's (National Socialist German Workers Party) was in reality a Socialistic endeavor. To label it conservative is a glaringly illogical deduction.<br /><br />Since the author's main conclusion are drawn from such falsehoods the whole book is suspect and can be passed by and nothing but a propaganda front for the new-socialist and their continuing ploy to tar the conservatives with the atrocities of their political kin.<br /><br />*************************<br />Added 5/7/08<br /><br />This review along with several others has created a vast majority of comments by those who have very little understanding in this area. To label a political movement either right or left wing involves actually &lt;gasp> studying the ideals behind the movement. It seems that the vast majority of the comments are written by those who \\"feel\\" that anything from the right side of the political spectrum is bad. Fascism is bad, therefore fascism = right wing.<br /><br />To fully understand a movement is more complex then the following but this gives the readers a good starting point. If you ask yourself two questions it will guide you in the correct direction in 99.9% of all the cases.<br /><br />Question #1<br /><br />Where do the rights of the individuals come from?<br /><br />Left wing ideology dictates that \\"the state\\" is the one that grants and controls rights, while Right Wing ideology says rights are natural and inalienable, they are fixed and the state cannot grant right nor should it take them away.<br /><br />Hitler believed in and further developed the idea of \\"der staat\\" or \\"the state\\" was the supreme ruling agency and grantor of rights. Mussolini was no different and spoke about the state behind the supreme ruling agency over the people.<br /><br />In their political ideology fascists and Nazi's whole-heartedly supported the ideas of left-wing ideology.<br /><br />Question #2<br /><br />Who owns and controls the capital of the nation?<br /><br />Left wing economic theory dictates that capital, in varying degrees, is owned and controlled by the state, while right wing economic theory says that capital is owned by the citizens and the government should have minimal to no control or ownership of it.<br /><br />In Hitler's Germany, businesses while not taken away from the owners were put under the control of the government. Government \\"managers\\" were installed in the larger businesses to make sure that the policies and procedures that the government wanted were followed strictly. Any business owner who strayed from the party line had his business seized.<br /><br />To fully understand Hitler's economic policy I suggest a in depth study of Gottfried Feder, the head economist of the Nazi party. Here is perhaps the most complete book written by Feder himself and endorsed whole-heartly by Hitler, [...]<br /><br />Unfortunately it is german, but well worth your time if you read german.<br /><br />In Italy Mussolini believed in agrarian principals and his system was more of feudal state. The government owned the land, but granted the right to farm it or work it to the individuals, this is the same of the business. But the actual ownership belonged to the state.<br /><br />In their economic theories and practices fascists and Nazi's whole-heartedly supported the ideas of left-wing economics.<br /><br />If the reader wishes to be honest and drops the ideas that fascism is a pejorative word used only to attack the right they will have to admit that in these two key areas we can see that fascism and Nazism have their roots in left-wing ideology.<br /><br />Does this mean that left-wingers are fascist? NO, but I think it's time that we at least get honest about this subject.he state\\" is the one that grants and controls rights, while Right Wing ideology says rights are natural and inalienable, they are fixed and the state cannot grant right nor should it take them away.

That's a good thing for those of us in the center and on the right. The left only uses their big guns against opponents that can win and then convert that victory into achievements that hurt their socialistic ideals. Newt is such a man.<br /><br />The 1994 Contract with America was a remarkable tool for political and governmental change. Led by this contract the republicans had their biggest congressional victory since before the great depression. The results of 1994 stunned liberals and almost everybody else but it was what the contract accomplished that is its legacy.<br /><br />1. The first major tax cut in sixteen. (Which help boost the economy and kept it moving right along.)<br /><br />2. Real welfare reform, reducing the number of people on welfare by 60 percent and insisting that welfare recipients go t school or look for a job.<br /><br />3. The first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920's.<br /><br />4. The first financial audit of the house by an outside auditing firm, a practice that continues today.<br /><br />5. Term limits for the committee chairmen in the house.<br /><br />6. Applying o the House all the laws that apply to small business so politicians can learn what the self-employed and small business men and women endure from the government.<br /><br />7. Strengthening the military of the United States.<br /><br />8. The invention of the Thomas system that allows internet access to the US House of Representatives, bypassing lobbyists and privileged insiders.<br /><br />It was these accomplishments that drew the ire of the liberals.<br /><br />In this book we revisit the contract but now Newt has it as an updated 21st century contract hitting some of the most hot button topics around, social security, Immigration, Education, Health Care, Trade, etc. And once again we have answers that come from a reasoned intellectual process rather than a emotion knew-jerk reacting left. I highly suggest this book to anyone right, center or left. For those on the right you can see that Newt is a true conservative, he doesn't have neocon thoughts. For those in the center you should know by now that conservatism is the populist part because it looks out for you and doesn't pander to special interest groups. For those on the left, you can see a reasoned approach to policies that help everyone not a fraction of the country.<br /><br />This book has presidential aspirations written all over it. I think Newt will run into problems there. The lefts fear of him, which the rears its ugly head as hatred will trounce him into the ground. The liberals are just to entrenched in the media to allow a fair hearing of Newt's newest contract.

The main reason the liberals cannot communicate is because they are not `framing' their ideas in terms that liberals understand. He also states that liberals are trying to communicate using frames that the conservatives have set up and favor the conservative's ideas.<br /><br />George opines that conservatives and liberals look at issues differently and therefore speak differently about the issues. He states that how we think and frame issues are based upon how we view child rearing. He uses the term `strict father' to describe the conservative model and `nurturant values' to describe the liberal model.<br /><br />However these models, which is bases the rest of the book seem to have some deep flaws in them. Most conservatives, would hold many of the nurturant values as their own (as can be witnessed by asking conservative or by reading other reviews about this book). And as Mr. Lakoff confesses many liberals follow the strict father models more than the nurturant one.<br /><br />I think that there are more accurate models out there such of the emotive vs cognitive model that seems to fit better. In this model liberals (emotive) generally get their ideas and frame facts with `how they feel about the subject.' Conservatives (cognitive) generally get their ideas and frame facts with `how they think about the subject.' PLEASE NOTE this in no ways mean that liberals don't think it is simply that their thought process is based on emotions and feeling.<br /><br />For Instance a liberal sees a homeless person and their first thought is how terrible it is that he is homeless (emotive thought based on empathy) they then think about what they can do to help him. A conservative in this case would first think how did this person get into this predicament (cognitive thought based on how's and why's) and then think about what they can to stop this from happening.<br /><br />(You can immediately see the problems with both of these, the liberals generally give immediate care to the problem, not addressing root causes or preventative steps, the conservatives try to fix the problems without addressing the needs of those who are hurting. Neither side is perfect!)<br /><br />Mr. Lakoff's theory states the above about liberals but misses several crucial points when understanding conservative thought process. In all his theory about liberals appear to be 80% on the target while his theory about conservatives looks to be about 30% on target. (Chapter 7 What the Right Wants is particularly offensive and seems to mischaracterize those on the right in a rather mendacious way. If you include that chapter in with his theory then he only 10% on target when discussing conservatives.)<br /><br />To give an example lets see how Mr. Larkoff uses his theory and `frames' to discuss certain issues. We'll take the hot button topic of gay marriage. The author using his liberal mindset reframes the issue to one of fairness, which is primarily a emotive thought. Therefore to quiet those pesky right-wingers opines Mr. Larkoff all the good liberal needs to do is ask this simple question.<br /><br />\\"Do you think it is fair for the government to tell you who to marry?\\"<br /><br />This sort of question reframes the whole subject away from the cognitive discussion that the right is having to a emotive one that the liberal views as a slam dunk. Mr. Larkoff is so supremely confident in this question that he uses it as a example in 3 different places in a 119 page book.<br /><br />The problem with this slam dunk question is that while the liberal is smugly confident, he has failed to look at the question using the cognitive model. If one takes the time think about this question it becomes all too apparent that it is a simple strawman. For the liberals I suggest to prove it to them that they go to their local government office and apply for a marriage license to marry a:<br /><br />1. Turnip (or in fairness any other vegetable that they may choose)<br /><br />2. Your sibling<br /><br />3. Your favorite pet<br /><br />4. Your cousin<br /><br />5. Your dead friend<br /><br />6. The across the street 9 year old<br /><br />As you can see the government does tell us who and what we can marry.<br /><br />I use this example to not try to win a gay marriage debate but to rather show that Mr. Larkoffs ideas of trying to swing voters using his model may not work. He reframes his issue to make sense to emotive people, but this will not win the cognitive's that he is trying to win over. It has been apparent to many sociologist that about 30% of people are almost exclusively emotive (the hard left) while 30% of the people are almost exclusively cognitive (the hard right). It is that middle 40% that is up for grabs. The problem is that sociologist have shown that most of them when given a clear choice between emotive thought or cognitive thought lean towards cognitive thought. This is the simple reason republicans are winning more than the democrats. When both sides argue about a point, the cognitive arguments win over more people then emotive ones.ffice and apply for a marriage license to marry a:<br /><br />1.

US	50819380	R28VX23AOK5EDN	0060558288	261484893	God's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It	Books	1	6	11	N	N	Jim's Politics	Jim tries to convince us that his views are those found in the bible. Since the book is lengthy and overly verbose I will focus on only one section of it, Part IV.- Economic Justice.<br /><br />Jim seems to have a great passion for the poor of this country, while most people do have compassion for the poor, it is important to first understand what is meant to be poor or living in poverty. Jim seems ignorant o the fact that most of America's Poor DO NOT remain in poverty for more than 2 years. The typical immigrant to this country will be classified as living in poverty but the vast majority of them move up socio-economic ladder very quickly. The poor in our country have the quickest upwardly mobility of any nation, hence why so many people aspire to come here.<br /><br />There are however, several other groups that make up the permanent poor. One group is the single mothers, and no group has done more to expose and help this travesty than those on the right have. While the left, champions sexually liberation, abortion, and dead-beat dads, the conservative around the country have been writing books and preaching to the inner city youth and especially the minorities about the deleterious consequences of being a single mother. This hard work by conservatives appears to be paying off as the single mothers living in poverty rates have been declining, unlike the reaping of the left that caused a whole generation to live in poverty.<br /><br />Another complaint of Jim's is about welfare, back when Clinton signed the welfare reform bill, people who had been on welfare for 10+ years had succumbed to the entitlement mentality. There are welfare recipients that just preferred to not work and collect a portion of everybody else's paychecks. The bible speaks very strongly about this in 2 Thess 3:10-12<br />10 For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat. 11 For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies. 12 Now those who are such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread.<br /><br />However, Jim is not so upset that the welfare reform act denies permanent welfare instead he seems to be upset that it is set up to help people learn marketable skills and then find a job. It has generous programs for single-mothers to help them with child-care and jobs. It even boosted the EITC, which is a program that pays people federal money, who are working at minimum wage jobs, and thus keeps them employed. This program allows people to get work experience and move up the ladder. Quite a good Christian thing to do, yet Jim is against all of this.<br /><br />Jim also has himself in an uproar because of GW's tax cuts \\"that favor the rich\\" Unfortunately this liberal mantra just isn't true. Anybody who has simple cognitive skills can reed the CBO report that was produced at the request of congressional Democrats. It confirms that tax cuts since 2001 increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners. INCREASED! It increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners, while decreasing the tax share of lower and middle-income groups.<br /><br />Hello, automata on the left, are you paying attention, go back and read the CBO report about Clinton's draconian tax increase on the MIDDLE CLASS. It very clearly stated that lower and middle-income groups had their taxes RAISED disproportionately, while the top earners received little if any tax increase.<br /><br />If you favor the middle class you have to vote republican, not for elitist billionaire candidates like Kerry, who would only hand out more favors to his fellow billionaires.<br /><br />Also what does the bible say about taxation Jim? Other than to render unto Caesars what is Caesars we can take a lesson from how God taxes his people. It is called a tithe and in the OT it was a flat 10% on everybody including the poor. God is simply stating that all people are equal and fairness/evenness is the name of the game. You don't see God insisting that the top 20% pay 80% of the tithes like we do in this country. So you would expect Jim to take up what the bible is teaching about tithes and apply it to a fair doctrine of taxation, a flat tax if you will. But Jim doesn't again.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that Jim's books is really about advancing his radical left wing agenda under the guise of it being biblical. I guess the radical lefties will do anything!qual and fairness/evenness is the name of the game. You don't see God insisting that the top 20% pay 80% of the tithes like we do in this country.

US	50819380	R19E8YTG94RFF0	0465001769	492085239	What Liberal Media?: The Truth About Bias and the News	Books	2	2	4	N	N	What Looking Glass?,	This tome has received a plethora of good reviews so I was hoping for a intelligent fact filled discourse that could prove the title worthy. Instead this book is simply written for the hard left choir, readers whose main ideas of fact checking is believing that anything bad said about the center or the right is correct.<br /><br />The best quote of the book starts on page XI in the preface when the author admits it is \\"complicated psychologically to write a book that so perfectly contradicts . . . wisdom. . .\\" Perhaps if Eric had studied his first sentence he would have seen perhaps it be better to be wise than to open ones mouth and prove that they are a fool.<br /><br />This book starts out `un-wisely' but continues downhill from there, \\"his many undocumented, exaggerated assertions have the flavor of self-parody rather than reasoned argument.\\" Some examples.<br /><br />In Chp. 2 Eric admits that most journalists are liberal. \\"The vast majority are pro-choice, pro-gun control, pro-separation of church and state, pro-feminism, pro-affirmative action, and supportive of gay rights.\\" (21)<br /><br />But in the lefts orwellian doublespeak he has no problem contradicting himself by denying that journalists are liberal just TWO paragraphs later. \\"Nevertheless the overall pattern is undeniably consistent, and it is not `liberal'\\". (21)<br /><br />The next 4 chapters (75 pages) of the books talks about opinion writers, Eric calls them the punditocracy. This is the main point that he hopes to cement home that guess what people; there are right wing pundits out there. Everybody let out a huge collective gasp.<br /><br />What Eric and the rest of the SCLM (Socialist Communistic Loving Media) doesn't get is that when the center complains about liberal bias they don't mean the nattering nabobs of the opinion page or talk radio, they mean the news anchors and the page one writers. Since Eric chose not to address the TRUE problem, he simply creates a strawman argument, easily seen by the intelligent, but missed by the choir.<br /><br />Chp 8 is about the treatment that Free Trade and Enron has received by the media. Free trade is championed by the socialistic left and paradoxically by the neo-cons. The left views it as a way of transferring wealth to the poorer nations making everybody more equal. This mantra of egalitarianism has been taken up by the media to help promote this nefarious idea. Eric nevertheless uses this example of true conservatives (who are against free trade) being in control of the media!<br /><br />Enron, who was the biggest supporter of Clinton, had its officers spent more nights in the Clinton white house than any other group, had all of its accounting irregularities happen on Clinton's watch, yet Eric doesn't seem to know any of this. Perhaps the most damning piece of factual evidence is who broke open the story about Enron, It was the WSJ and the Economist, both highly conservative publications. Immediately following was Forbes, fortune and Fox News. The liberal media was scarred silly, the biggest boondoggle in liberal corporate America had just happened and it was with one of Clinton's supporters. How in the world will the SCLM report this one, they spin it and blame the conservatives!<br /><br />Chp 9 is the shortest in the book and for good reason, it is about the media's treatment of Clinton. Most independent observers would grant that the Clinton team caught every break in the world from the American Media. If any one of the multitude of scandals had happened during a Republican presidents term the media would have been relentless in its coverage instead we had most issues barely mentioned. There were no Pulitzer prizes awarded for in-depth investigations, instead we had the biggest cover-up aided and abetted by the SCLM.<br /><br />Contrast this coverage to that Clinton received in Europe, while the media their loved him as a man they hated his corruptness. The media in Europe excoriated him because of the scandals and did more in depth reporting than any American-I-voted-for-him,-I-love-him,-I-won't-say-a-bad-thing-about-him-reporter.<br /><br />Chp 10 is a strange chapter about the 2000 election the only thing that it proves is that Nancy Reagan was right. Eric you should have just said NO, because the drugs have done strange things to your brain. Regardless of who you voted for, I voted for neither of them, one thing was imminently clear. Al Gore had been the media's darling since he was picked to be Bill Clinton's running mate 8+ years earlier. The media had crowned Prince Gore while showing universal hostility to Bush (no real surprise here).<br /><br />Chp 11 speaking about the debacle in Florida can only be graciously said that Mr. Alterman is a supreme liar. The verifiable facts are as follows:<br /><br />GW won all 4 state recounts<br /><br />GW won 8 out of 9 NORC recounts. (This was the SCLM attempt to prove that Al Gore Won using their own money - it didn't work either.)<br /><br />Al Gore filed the first lawsuit in the state to ban the counting of overseas military personal ballots.<br /><br />The election was called for Gore 2 hours before the polls closed in Florida. This has been estimated by Democratic sources of disenfranchising 15,000 voters in the panhandle region. This region, btw, is the most conservative in Florida.<br /><br />Al Gore only wanted liberal counties recounted, the state rules said that a whole state recount had to be done. This was what the supreme court fight was about.<br /><br />The supreme courts first decision was 9-0 (Eric describes this as partisan???)<br /><br />The supreme courts second decision was 7-2, meaning 3 liberal judges agreed that you can't change the rules after the election.<br /><br />The demonstration in Miami was because the liberal media and the democrats took all the Dade County ballots and was going to do an official recount in private. Not one center or conservative person was allowed to participate.<br /><br />As Stalin once said \\"He who casts the vote decides nothing. He who counts the vote decides everything.\\"candals and did more in depth reporting than any American-I-voted-for-him,-I-love-him,-I-won't-say-a-bad-thing-about-him-reporter.<br /><br />Chp 10 is a strange chapter about the 2000 election the only thing that it proves is that Nancy Reagan was right.

The liberals controlled television, newsprint and radio. Then a funny thing happened some silly liberal publisher thought it would be fun to allow several right wing writers space in the opinion page of the newspaper. This, as far as Brock is concerned, started the slippery slope. Once those darn right-wingers got their viewpoint, albeit only on the opinion page, people started to listen and worse yet they begin to think.<br /><br />During the 1980's the media underwent a period of deregulation which led to the most disastrous defeat to date. This defeat wasn't the deregulation bill but what resulted from it; Rush Limbaugh, the anathema of the left. And after Rush the almost inconceivable of all atrocities, those pesky patriotic, free speech loving wacky right-wingers got their own news channel; FOX on cable TV.<br /><br />Mr. Brock opines that because of this dominance by the right wing media (Fox, WSJ, and Washington Times) over the liberal media (ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, CNBC, Almost all local affiliates, NPR, New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angles Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Miami Herald, Chicago Tribune, ETC, ETC, ETC.) is a threat to free speech and democracy itself.<br /><br />I can see why Mr. Brock is worried that there are ONLY 3 major conservative media choices out there versus the 100's of liberal ones. This is definitely a threat and one that cannot be taken lightly.<br /><br />I am sure Mr. Brock and I agree that the implications of the pre 1980's left-wing media incursion extended well beyond particular political outcomes and threatened the very heart of our democracy. Democracy depends upon on informed citizenry. The conscious effort by the left wing to misinform the American citizenry - to collapse the distinction between journalism and propaganda - is thus an assault on democracy itself.<br /><br />The problem is really not so much one of \\"bias\\" as the right wing terms it, but to where the bias leads. In the biased mainstream left-wing media, among biased left-wing commentators, and even in the so-called right wing media which has become susceptible to left-wing scripting. For Example: The state of Florida being called for Gore 2 hours before the polls closed and with early exit polls showing Bush winning. The major liberal media outlets called it for Gore and Fox followed suit. Of course the manipulation by the massive left-wing media is never discussed in this book but shows how the single right-wing cable news outlet is many times forced to keep up with their liberal agenda. All of this leads to verifiable journalistic malpractice, to the publication of misinformation, and the ethical malfeasance. At a deeper level, the existence and influence of the left-wing media as presently constituted is an affront to logic, rationality, and the maintenance of shared knowledge base from which political consensus and correct policy choices can be forged.<br /><br />Mr. Bock you are right your book deserves 10 Stars or more we cannot have a true democracy until there is some parity with our media. I suggest some of the following to help the imbalance.<br /><br />We will TAX liberal media outlets and give this tax dollars to help form more conservative media outlets.<br /><br />We will, by government fiat, seize control of ABC and NBC and give their assets to the underprivileged FOX news.<br /><br />We will set up a mega government agency to monitor all news reports, then the censures will be able to edit out inappropriate left wing material and substitute it with clips from FOX.<br /><br />We need to take action, the small inroads the right has made can in no-way tilt the scales of justice and fairness, more must be done.<br /><br />Thank you again, Mr. Brock your book has been invaluable for me.ias\\" as the right wing terms it, but to where the bias leads.

The book tries to use Kansas as corollary to what is going on throughout the US. While there can be some analogies drawn, I think to much can also be made. The author does a nice job in trying to blend the two outlooks. But first let's examine what the author states.<br /><br />In the 1800's when Kansas was just beginning it was inhabited by mostly radical conservative people. It was a mecca for industries at that time and the living standards were high. By the depression times Kansas had drifted far the left. It seems that Kansas went into the depression and never really revived out of it. The big change started during the 1980's when every state of the union was enjoying phenomenal growth, Kansas with its left wing politicians and ideology was stagnating. So the populist started in 1990 a swing back to the right. Lo and behold Kansas's economy started to recover, jobs were increased and wages went up. Seeing that the lower and middle class people were benefiting from the right wing programs and were generally hurt by the left wing programs, Kansas has continued to drift farther to the right.<br /><br />With that history, as laid out in the book, Mr. Frank paradoxically asks the question of why does the middle class and blue collar workers vote for the Republicans?<br /><br />Then almost beyond belief he posits the next question why do these same people vote republican and that will hurt them economically? Excuse me, he gives us a history that you would think we be in a book penned by Coulter, Limbaugh, or Hannity, a history that is absolutely damning of the liberal policies economically and one that shows quite clearly that the Right wing policy helps the lower and middle class more. Just using his book as a guide, anybody who is not wealthy would be insane to vote for a liberal. It goes against their best economic interests.<br /><br />Once you get past the history of Kansas you will find that the book has two main themes<br /><br />1) Classical socialistic class warfare - For the liberal class warfare issue to work it becomes an absolute ontological necessity that there be a profound all corrupting capitalistic business influence as the dark existence. It's not fair that somebody had more money, a bigger house, a nicer car, etc than you. Therefore if you are smart/intellectual (arrogant) person you will be angry at that individual and want to extract justice (higher taxes) on them and make everybody equal.<br /><br />2) Victimization - Without a victim mentality the left cannot manipulate its members. Remember the reason somebody has more than you is because the big bad world is against you.<br /><br />The book is a great example of the failure of the Left's social engineering policy and the extreme arrogance of liberals. Liberalism is a matter of shallow appearance of fatuous self-righteousness. It is arrogant and condescending, a politics in which the beautiful, well educated, limousine liberals tell the unwashed and beaten down trailer trash how they ought to behave, how they should stop being racist or homophobic, how they should be better people.<br /><br />Thomas Frank in all his aggrandizing pop-psychology fails to miss the point that human beings don't like being talked down to. The left is full of condescending bubble-headed morons that want to impose their utopian ideals upon us. The problem is these ideals and programs have failed miserably over the last 50 years causing more suffering than they were meant to alleviate.<br /><br />Sorry Tommy, the problem in this world isn't Kansas its Liberals.warfare - For the liberal class warfare issue to work it becomes an absolute ontological necessity that there be a profound all corrupting capitalistic business influence as the dark existence.

It's main focus seemed to be on managing time and for those of you who don't know the secret I will let you in on it. Excellent Tenants = Minimal Time. It's finding and keeping the excellent tenants that require some time. This book goes into detail about how to do just that. If you are a struggling landlord or a complete newbie than this book is for you.<br /><br />However, if you have some experience in this area, or are an effective manager outside of rental properties you will probably be an effective rental manager. Other things to consider is that Mr. Perry seems to specialize in very low cost rentals so much of his ideas are drawn towards those crowds. For Example<br /><br />Getting Tenants the book says advertising the local newspaper is the best, it does work but for higher cost rentals I average about 70% of new tenants from the internet.<br /><br />Dishwashers and Garbage Dispoals - you might be able to get away without them in cheap units, but try renting a unit at 1500 a month without them - it just wouldn't work.<br /><br />Wainscot - Again nice idea for those low income units, but most people look at wainscot as that cheap stuff you had on your vacation home when you grew up.<br /><br />Electric Water Heaters - Keep gas if you have it already, electric heaters are always more problems and will cost more in the long run - gas is always easier and better. BTW, if you go to a plumbing wholesale warehouse (usually open only to licensed plumbers) the gas units are cheaper than electric.<br /><br />When buying a home Mr. Perry seems to think that plumbing problems are easily fixed. Caveat Emptor - A person who bought a house that I passed on due to plumbing problems just spent $22,000 in getting it re-plumbed. From my experience I walk away from any house that 1) has foundation problems 2) has flooded recently 3) has major plumbing problems. I am highly suspicious of any house that has 1) Roof Problems 2) Electrical problems.<br /><br />Things not mentioned that might help you out.<br /><br />Automatic Rent Payments - I have about 50% of my tenants on automatic rent payments. It's easy to set up (talk to your bank) and you get your money every month on the same day.<br /><br />If you have more than 5 units I strongly urge you to look into incorporating. It limits you liability and there are positive tax reasons to do so. This book barley mentions corporations and in a slightly negative way too.<br /><br />If you buy in the right area and market your unit accordingly it is very easy to get some long term leases written up. I have approximately 70% of my tenants on 3 year or longer lease agreements.<br /><br />While mentioned I have had a great deal of success with Townhomes and Condos - just be aware that this is very AREA sensitive. The plus side to these is that you can be a truly hands off landlord. Write your rental agreements that the tenants agree to take care of all repairs inside including AC/Heat. The associations take care of everything outside and all you do is collect the rent. True your returns are not as high, but it is the simplest form of rental management that I know of. Also, if the townhome/condo is slightly upper scale you will find that your vacancy rates drop considerably. The shortest tenant I have ever had in a townhome/condo was 1 year with my average being around 6 years.<br /><br />Anyhow, This book is good for the beginners, that is why I gave it 4 stars.suspicious of any house that has 1) Roof Problems 2) Electrical problems. <br /> <br />Things not mentioned that might help you out. <br /> <br />Automatic Rent Payments - I have about 50% of my tenants on automatic rent payments.

What the authors and those on the left didn't think about was that with the advent of the internet and the deregulation of media, a new powerful force was about to be unleashed upon the people. No longer would the citizens be subjected to the nightly leftwing propaganda known as news, instead they would have free access to information. The internet has dispelled a cornucopia of left wing myths while alternate news sources that are winning droves of people and causing the left wing major news outlets to soften the political slant.<br /><br />What the authors and those on the left have also not considered is that the populist have watched the democrat party pander to every fringe radical belief, they have watched these radical movements push from the left while the republicans, squashed without a voice and without the mighty political machine that the left has, silently slide further and further to the center. This has had an effect over time of redefining the center further to the left. Now however, the populist are fed up with programs that have failed over and over again. They are tired of the propaganda that has been fed to them and the people have woken up. These `new' Democrats are a foreign entity to most Americans.

Anyone who has cognitive ability to distinguish that professional wrestling is fake can easily destroy Michael Moore's sophomoric rants and his use of classical propaganda techniques. As we all know, classic propaganda works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum with completely false ideas. For Example Charlton Heston was depicted as a racist by Moore's use of editing his sound bites. You never learn that Mr. Heston was the leader of the Civil Rights movement, a personal friend of Martin Luther King and a regular speaker for the Congress on Racial Equity. This is known as spin in free countries and works incredibly well when the subjects are uneducated and ill equipped to perform simple reasoning tasks. (Hence why lefties are against school choice, the resultant more-informed graduates would be harder to manipulate and control.)<br /><br />But what the authors have also shown is that Moore practices a totalitarian approach to mind control. He cannot get enough evidence to fit his ideological presuppositions so he therefore creates his own truth. What makes Moore unique is his willingness to construct his myths on a scaffolding of calculated untruths. Michael Moore, quite cleverly, but immorally, CREATES his own sound bites. He does this by altering timelines, quotes, and statistics in a perverse diabolical way just to prove his point. For example in Bowling for Columbine, Moore spliced 8 sections of different speeches together to create the speech he wanted his subjects to hear. The FACT is the speeches he spliced together said the opposite of what Mr. Moore's edited film says in of no concern to him or his lemming like audience.<br /><br />I'll be blunt: Michael Moore has a truth problem, he sells fact free drivel. Moore distorts (1) reality (2) hypes fear (3) induces hate. But there is a perverse genius behind this calculated distorted reality. Michael Moore's combination of embitterment and manipulative totalitarian propaganda energizes the hate-filled mind-numbed automata of the left, which is why they have elevated this peddler of fear and hate as their iconic hero.izes the hate-filled mind-numbed automata of the left, which is why they have elevated this peddler of fear and hate as their iconic hero.	2004-09-04

The book also suffers from a being rather unorganized and incredibly short. It seems to me that the author has attempted to immolate the world of 3 second sound bites rather than dive deeply into any of the subjects that have been presented.<br /><br />Ms. Halsell is obviously ideologically attached to her position, therefore there is no in depth analysis of the other side. For anybody who is remotely aware of the history of Israel and the Palestinians it can become downright painful to read the propaganda that she spews forth. For example, for her to get a `true' history of the Palestinians she did NOT spend time in the library researching, nor did the author even speak to the acclaimed historians on both sides, instead she simply found a devout Arab Muslim and garnered all of her historical perspective from him (Chapter 8). WOW that's unbiased isn't it!<br /><br />Another example of this reporting is how she exposes Jerry Falwell's theology. Does she interview him? NO! Does she study his writings and teachings? NO! Does she do anything that a respective unbiased reporter would do? NO! Instead she proudly gets all the information from 3 individuals who are rank and file followers of Mr. Falwell.<br /><br />But is this book all bad, No, as with most cases of propaganda there is some truth mixed in with the lies. For example the author is correct in stating that dispensationalism is a recent invention. But she is in major error when labels it a cult. Dispensationalism, which I disagree with, does not in any way reach the sociological or psychological definition of a cult. In order for her to link them to a cult status she mentions the likes of Jim Jones or leaders of the \\"Branch Davidians\\" or \\"Heaven's Gate,\\" who led followers to death declaring the end is near. The only problem with this analogy is none of these cultic leaders were dispensationalists. She is also either, intentionally or in ignorance, mentions Christian teachers who are not dispensationalists and tries to lump them in with dispensationalists.<br /><br />For Christians who take their bible seriously there is no doubt that Jesus will come again for the saints on the earth. There is also no question that there will be a tribulation or that there will be one final battle. Ms Halsell's seems to question all of these ideas which are really not in question to serious biblical scholars. What is in question is will the rapture occur BEFORE, DURING or at the END of the tribulation. That is the question.<br /><br />The only reason this book seems to have been written is to enforce the author's thoroughly anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, anti-Christian bias. It would seem to me that the author is so open-minded to the ideas of the terrorists of Palestine that her brains have fallen out. Give this book a pass.sts.

US	50819380	R37054JW0AST6H	0525948139	537228107	The President of Good and Evil: The Ethics of George W. Bush	Books	1	5	8	N	N	The Author of Inconsistency and Hypocrisy	I am not a fan of President Bush, and I think many of his actions should be questioned but Singer stated objective in this book is to bridge the gap of the \\"hate\\" Bush books with a reasoned critique. He fails miserably on both accounts; not enough hate for the rabid left and not enough reason for the intelligent.<br /><br />One aggravating part of the book was Mr. Singers condescending tone, and the way he treats anyone who disagrees with his assumptions. This condescension along with a simplistic prose makes one wonder if he has the view that he is lecturing a child whom he feels beneath him. I prefer to be spoken at, not down to as this book does. But perhaps the most frustrating part of the whole book is the rank hypocrisy that is extant throughout it. If you hold Singer to a yardstick of rational and logical standards you will find the book fails dreadfully.<br /><br />For example, Singer debates two dissimilar laws one is about the use of marijuana and the other is about the role of the EPA. In the first case Singer take the position that states should have more rights, they should be able to enact laws and legislation without the federal government interfering. It would then also be the states responsibility to police and enforce these issues because they do better job at it. What is interesting is that President Bush disagrees about the use of drugs but agrees with the notion that states should have the right to choose on both laws. Bush puts aside his dislike of drugs to keep a steady and logical grasp upon the issue of states' rights. Singer on the other hand only uses such notions as states' rights to help impose upon us his political ideology as we will see.<br /><br />If you cherish logic and consistency as I do then you would think that Singer would want to impose the same doctrine of states' rights on the issue of the EPA laws, but alas, he wants the federal government to be in control and not the states and the rationale he gives:<br /><br />\\"(E)nforcement problems tend to be national rather than specific to particular states\\" (74) This is the opposite reasoning that is used for the changing of the drug laws. Singer simply spins every issue, logic and reasoning are thrown out, inconsistency and ideology rules the day, and truth, as we will learn shortly, is a malleable concept to Singer.<br /><br />On page 101 Singer declares that portions of Bush's speech are divisive because they sometimes hint at his belief in God. Although this shows a great insecurity that Mr. Singer harbors what is interesting is that he insists that Bush should not mention God. In reality Mr. Singer is proposing a restriction on the presidents liberty and right to free speech. But 7 pages later when singer admits that some of his ideas and speeches may offend people he does not self censure his freedom of speech, instead he pens the following<br /><br />\\"What offends people is not fixed. People can learn to be more tolerant, and that is a better solution than restricting the liberty of others.\\" (108)<br /><br />So according to Singer we must be tolerant of his thoughts and learn to not be offended. But we must be intolerant of Bush's thoughts because someone might be offended. This is a blatant double standard which shows Singers persistent unfairness and his inability to be partial.<br /><br />There are a plethora of other examples in this tome of hypocrisy. But near the end of the book we realize why Singer cannot reason rationally. On page 212-213 Singer explains that nearly everyone who has been associated with Bush, enemies and allies have come away feeling that he is exceptionally honest. In a book about ethics you would think that Bush would be applauded but instead Singer proclaims that taking the obligation to be truthful and acting upon it consistently suggests an arrested moral development. (213)<br /><br />Read that again and let it sink in, Peter Singer lecturing on ethics says telling the truth shows that you are morally backward, therefore lying shows a higher evolution of your morals. That is the whole book in a nutshell; the preaching of narcissistic moral relativism that pervades the authors thought pattern. Singers? applauding of moral relativism no doubt resides strongly in him because of his academic background. It would be comforting to think that Singer and his ilk are the minority but it is truly scary to think that these miscreants are the norm in our pathetic world of academia. No wonder why our children can't reason logically.<br /><br />While Singer stated in the beginning that he wanted to discuss Bush's ethics, in the end the book does more to affirm Singers morally relativistic positions then dissect Bush. It has to be obvious to the impartial observer that Singer has a deep seated, almost metaphysical anger toward Bush. This book unfortunately, is written for the simpleton choir, whose rallying cry is their hatred of President Bush. Truth, logic and reasoned be damned, hypocrisy rules the day. For all the reasons stated above I do not suggest this book.book in a nutshell; the preaching of narcissistic moral relativism that pervades the authors thought pattern.

Mr Berman has a `through the looking glass' perspective of programs. If it works it was obviously a liberal idea and if it fails it was a conservative idea. For example he rallies along the false notion that Hitler was a right wing conservative, yeah right. Lets see, he was the leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party (NAZI) and all one has to do is read Hitler's speeches to find out that he was a totalitarian socialist.<br /><br />The substance of the book though is the inescapable fact that there can be no peace with an ideological entity that believes you are evil and they have an edict to kill you. What is shocking to this reader is the naivet&eacute; that those on the left, especially the author posses. He shows just how immersed he is in his circles of left-ism that he and many others like him have left reality. Mr. Berman was shocked that 9/11 would happen, as a matter of fact he has the temerity to say that nobody imagined such an event. This viewpoint only shows the ignorance of the intelligentsia of the left, for there were many books, articles, and the plethora of attacks on the Unites States that preceded this act proved the threat that radical Islam posed for the world. Of course, the radical appeasement minded left pooh-poohed this notion and implied that this was the conservative ramblings of the war-mongering right.<br /><br />In the end Mr. Bearman gets it partially right, radical totalitarian Islam and the standard chamberlain-esque approach of appeasement does not work. Therefore at least this liberal writer has figured out that Islam with its goal of conquering the world is a dangerous construct. The two problems that Mr. Bearman never addresses are just how to convince others on the left that this form of totalitarianism is bad while their brand is good. And appeasement has never and will never work against a despotic dictator. Perhaps Mr. Bearman will continue to ponder these questions and come up with the answer.  One can only hope so..

The AU is a organization that borders on being a strict separationist group. However, Mr. Whiten in his book, portrays himself as a middle of the road seperationist, this false duality however bleeds through making one wonder why the facade.<br /><br />The book starts off portraying the normal left wing reactionary attack on religion. He incites the ignorant by his rhetoric that religious nuts want to impose a theocracy on us. These wacko's try to achieve this by telling us that the United States of America was started by our founding fathers to create a Christian (theocratic) state. Unfortunately this is a straw man as even finally Mr. Whiten tacitly admits, most clearly, on page 86, the only `Christian' group wanting to impose a theocracy are the Reconstructionist and this group is of minute proportions. So the actual question is what do most members of the mainstream religious right say about the United States and its founders. Well something like this:<br /><br />\\"The Christian religion, though its moral and religious teachings and its cultural influences, was a significant personal influence upon the delegates to the constitutional convention of 1787, and thus indirectly upon the constitution they drafted.\\"<br /><br />That's it, that's those supposed fanatical religious right have to say about the subject. Oh by the way, that quote comes right out of the authors' mouth on page 35. You see he even admits it. The dirty truth that Mr. Whiten doesn't want let out is that the United States of America was founded just as Patrick Henry said:<br /><br />\\"America was not founded by religionist but by Christians. It was not founded upon religions but upon the gospel of Jesus Christ\\" Patrick Henry<br /><br />The crux of the book seems to be the applauding of judicial revisionism that occurred in the 1940's regarding the establishment clause of the 1st amendment. For those who are unaware from when the constitution was written to the 1940's a total of 160 years the establishment clause had been interpreted in one way.<br /><br />In the 1940's through a liberal activist supreme court they reinterpreted the constitution to mean the opposite of its plain reading and original intent. This broad range and seeping decision created tensions between the establishment clause and the free exercise clause as the author has noted. Before this misinterpretation there was no tension and very little need for any judicial judgments on these matters. Now we have a quagmire of unclear rulings that hinder the free exercise clause while promoting the establishment clause.<br /><br />What is interesting is this very fear was exactly what the first amendment was created to stop. It is also noteworthy that this issue is exactly what Thomas Jefferson was speaking about when he answered the Danbury Baptists in his infamous letter. So while Mr. Whiten pays lip service to his favorite quote from Thomas Jefferson he in effect works for the antithesis of what Thomas Jefferson wanted. Mr. Whitten views Thomas Jefferson and the panoply of his writings and works through the proverbial `looking glass'.<br /><br />The very amendment that is crucial to what makes America great has been weakened and the author is gleeful over this. I wonder if Mr. Whiten realizes that freedom of religion and freedom of speech are inexorably linked. As he and others try to impose limits on religion they are also imposing limits on our freedom of speech. Sorry Mr. Whiten, I would rather have this country guaranteeing freedom OF speech along with freedom OF religion. Your goal of freedom FROM religion will logically lead to the pernicious freedom FROM speech.<br /><br />To sum up maybe we ought to reflect upon the sage advice of Thomas Jefferson: \\"The Constitution . . . is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please.\\"	2004-04-09

Normally I can zip through books of this nature in a evening, but not this one. I found myself getting several headaches from the hateful, vindictive, diatribe that Mr. Boston uses throughout the book. It is as if he has some deep metaphysical anger toward anybody or anything that identifies themselves as a Christian and a conservative.<br />There seems to be three themes that run throughout this book<br />1. Intolerance<br />Mr. Boston is simply intolerant of any belief that he does not hold. He has been a proud participant in denying freedom of speech (pg 73) to groups he does not like. He criticizes the promise keepers, a group that help marriages succeed. Mr. Barton even notes in the book they have a phenomenally low divorce rate. Is he out of touch by criticizing this group I think so, one only need to read the words of the Past President of the Los Angeles Chapter of NOW (a pretty liberal organization) and what she had to say about promise keepers. \\"Really who can argue with a movement that exhorts men to keep their promises, to be good fathers, loyal husbands and decent people?\\" Apparently Mr. Barton can because, but he is intolerant of them because they uphold values he does not. This intolerance continues throughout the book and gets nauseating after a while.<br />2. Moral Relativism<br />This second theme bootstraps off of the 1st. While Mr. Boston is intolerant of certain groups beliefs he puts forward a hypocritical moral relativism that says everything is okay except of course what the conservative Christians believe. In a truly saddening example Mr. Boston tells how he wants his children growing up to be able to do anything they want to do. He is afraid, almost disgusted, that someone from the Christian Right might tell his Children that pedophilia is wrong, or having your poor old grandmother beaten to death in a mugging might be wrong.<br />Does Mr. Boston make excuses for the perpetrators of these horrendous crimes? No, not at all instead he calls those who point out these acts of evil as the true villains of his utopian society. Sick, truly sick.<br />3. Judicial Activism<br />\\"The Constitution . . . is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please.\\" Thomas Jefferson<br />Judicial Activism is good, but ONLY when it advances your extreme beliefs other than that it is bad. Mr. Boston believes that litmus tests are good as long as they will lead to the exclusion of the judges he deems unworthy. This anti-democratic rant is particulary sad when you view the history of the United States and that the judiciary is to be used as a check and balance and not a legislative branch. But Mr. Boston fully realizes that he will never get his views advanced through the legislature because most people disagree with him instead he must use the judiciary; Scary and anti-American.<br />If you like hatred and intolerance this book will be for you, if you enjoy freedom of speech, American values, and democracy this book will be a big turn off., or having your poor old grandmother beaten to death in a mugging might be wrong.

However, it becomes clear to anyone who bothers to READ it that this book is far from the invective hate speech peppered with swear words that the left thrives upon. Sorry radical lefties, this book is definitely not written for the sophomoric individuals that think the pedantic ramblings of Moore and Franken posses some sort of reasoned argument.<br /><br />The first 50 pages of the book are a look at different worldviews, one conservative and 1 leftist. I particularly enjoyed Mr. Hannity's clear explanations of how each side looked at issues and why there are differences. It was refreshing to have an author be able to discuss a differing viewpoint without resorting to personal attacks. It is fascinating to note that you rarely find this in a book from the left, instead the left employs fervent hate filled ad hominem attacks against anyone they disagree with. Very rarely will you ever find the left trying to understand differences instead they wish to be divisive creating a wedge larger than one truly exists.<br /><br />It isn't until page 100 that Mr. Hannity starts dissecting the pernicious effects that radical leftism has had on the United States of America. He shows quite clearly that Bill Clinton through his naivet&eacute; and his multilateralist feelings of appeasement did insurmountable damage to this country and he is the main person to be held culpable for September 11. While this is not new news to anybody who isn't brain dead it is interesting how delicately Mr. Hannity presented the facts for you to draw out your own conclusion. Again no hyperbole or hatred, merely a lesson of what not to do, given in a very compassionate way.<br /><br />The book continues along in a very through and logical way. In the end you are presented a fantastic view of the difference between the two worldviews. If you dislike hate filled rhetoric and enjoy logic and reasoning then this book will be for you, regardless of what side of the political spectrum you are on., regardless of what side of the political spectrum you are on.	2004-04-09

Perhaps if reporters were to read the amendment they would understand that Freedom of the Press is inexorably linked to Freedom of Religion. Erode one and the erosion of the other will surly follow.<br /><br />To read this book one must distances themselves from their ideology. If you can do that then you can easily see how Christians in this country would feel discriminated against. The title `Persecution', as many have pointed out is a little excessive, but that should in no way negate the effects of the vast pernicious discrimination. Limbaugh does a good job in showing those on the ideological left who claim tolerance are really the MOST intolerant of any beliefs outside of their own. The hypocrisy is extant and miasmic.<br /><br />The question he fails to answer is why have these secularist launched a holy jihad against Christianity? Metaphysical reasons aside it would seem to this reviewer that they do not want their personal conduct to be judged. That is what this holy war is all about. If Christianity is allowed to be discussed in the public arena then questions about abortion, drug use, sexual orientation, or other moral dilemmas will be open for discussion. Above all secularists do not want open discussion, in fact they fear open discussion of ideas more than almost anything else, that is because they want a moral anarchy to exist, where adults can do anything they please by invoking the call of personal freedom.<br /><br />We have already seen the destructiveness of moral breakdowns since the 1960's, children born out of wedlock which is the primary cause of poverty, the rampant drug use which is the primary cause of violent crime along with many other breakdowns in the liberal `it's all about me' society. Of course the left has no answers or even compassion for those humans' lives that are destroyed and discarded in their selfish quest for personal nirvana. They show only contempt, what a disgraceful and sad commentary.<br /><br />To sum things up this country was founded on Judeo-Christian philosophy not on a particular religion. It is obvious to any clear thinking American #those who have not been propagandized by their ideology# that spirituality and Judeo-Christian philosophy were main ingredients that gave us the Constitution. Simply put historical revisionist and antireligious fanatics are tearing down what the Founders relied upon; moral clarity. But don't take my word for it, ponder the sage advice given by the founding fathers themselves:<br /><br />\\"God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of god?\\" Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />\\"We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. . . . Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\\" John Adams<br /><br />\\"I therefore beg leave to move - that henceforth, prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven and its blessing on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to officiate in that service.\\" Benjamin Franklin to the constitutional convention.<br /><br />\\"We have staked the whole future of American civilization, not upon thepower of government, far from it. We have staked the future of all of our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government; upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.\\"  James Madison<br /><br />\\"America was not founded by religionist but by Christians. It was not founded upon religions but upon the gospel of Jesus Christ\\" Patrick Henry<br /><br />Good Job Mr. Limbaughpower of government, far from it.

How can you take anything Greg Palast makes up, excuse me, writes about, is beyond an intelligent, rational person's ability to comprehend. About the most truthful item that Mr. Palast printed in this farcical tome is that &#34;no reputable news organization would report these stories.&#34; Yeah no kidding Greggy, no reputable organization reports about batboy visiting the pope, aliens abducting the president, or the devil appearing in your bowl of corn flakes either. But that's beyond the point; let's have a little fun looking at batboy's factual accounts.<br /><br />Chapter ONE<br /><br />Yawn old news that been proven false over and over again. 50 zillion voters did not get to vote in Florida because Jeb Bush ordered their removal from the voting records. Actually Greggy, it was the state legislature that enacted a law that the voting records be audited and adjusted every 4 years and that law had been on the books almost as long as Jeb has been alive. But don't let the facts mislead you; why not talk about how many people actually went to the voting booths and tried to vote and were turned away?<br /><br />Well Greg, oh yeah that's right because there were less than 30, whoops there goes your coveted theory down the drain. So what is old Greg to do. The only thing a pitiable tabloid reporter who wants to play in the big leagues can do. Play the race card. The biggest problem with Greg's race card is that most of those people who were turned away where white - republican voters. Pathetic, simply pathetic.<br /><br />Of course you would expect Greg to cover the California cover-up where 270,000 absentee ballots from the two most conservative counties in California never got counted. No, I didn't see that in the book, Hmmm. Or what about the misapplied vote totals in Idaho and Utah, the two most conservative states in the union? Nope not a mention. Or what about the over 100,000 oversees ballots from mostly conservative service people that never got counted? Again no mention, I wonder why? One last item why is not Greg investigating a New York town that voted 1,400 to 12 for Hillary Clinton and then a few months after the election Billy Clinton pardons the towns big shots who were serving time for massive fraud. No wouldn't want to investigate that sort of document-able voter coercion/fraud would you.<br /><br />The rest of the book is Greg's whiny little complaints about anything he can think of to make himself feel important. Overall it is stuff that &#34;real newspapers&#34; wouldn't print. Such as did you know that the Exxon Valdez ship didn't crash because the captain was drunk and a third mate, who could NOT pilot the supertanker, was ordered to do so ran it into a charted reef. No that's not what caused the accident according to batboy-Greg, it was because the radar was not turned on. It doesn't matter that the third mate doesn't know how to use the radar, nope and it also doesn't matter that even if the radar had been on it couldn't have stopped the ship. But to Batboy-Greg simply having the radar on would have put a magical force field around the ship and the reef, much like you see in cartoons causing the ship to magically bounce away from the reef, pleaaaaase get real.<br /><br />You will also learn on the pages of this screed that Pat Robertson is, get this, an alien imposter, no just kidding. Even worse though, Greggy pulled out all the stops on this one The good old preacher Pat is BIG DRUM ROLL, rich. Yes he is rich. I can't understand why 60 minutes is not doing a report about this. WOW thanks Greg. It keeps going on like this but I won't bore you any longer.<br /><br />In the end I guess the book was good for a laugh. I wasn't even going to write a review about it, I figured 100 other people already had exposed this for what it is. But low and behold look at all the ignorant Simple Simon's who think that Greg is a real reporter. Oh well PT BARNUM was right.rant Simple Simon's who think that Greg is a real reporter. Oh well PT BARNUM was right.	2004-02-03
US	50819380	RFZ3M98BVWDUR	0192801554	647568086	Fascism: A Very Short Introduction	Books	3	6	13	N	Y	A very mixed bag	The author has done a great deal of research on fascism and is knowledgeable about the subject. However the biggest problem with this book is that the author allows his political ideology to get in the way of his analysis and therefore he comes up with some flawed interpretations of the data.<br /><br />Fascism as the historical revisionist, including the author, sees it as some form of ultra right wing anti communistic/pro-capitalistic form of governance. While this may be the popular leftist drivel it definitely does not match the facts of fascism. The interesting part of this book is that you are given enough factual data to disprove the author's very thesis throughout the book.<br /><br />So just what are the major tenants of fascisms that make it a far right ideology? This is a question I have asked the few, professors that hold this false belief. The answers are usually a mumbled mixture of hmms, well, ahhh, I'll get back to you. So I waited in eager anticipation as to Mr. Passmore's reasoning and he did mention two.<br /><br />Fascism is hostile towards socialism and feminism.<br /><br />That's it, that's why he regards fascism as a far right phenomena, but lets take a closer look.<br /><br />First of all the author incorrectly calls the German Nazi's a fascist party. This is so absurd that it is easily rebuffed here, but first let me give a little history. The term NAZI was a nickname given to the members of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Socialist is the operative word here.) This is of course Hitler's outfit, which formed the core of the Third Reich. National Socialists are just another variation on the theme of Socialism and they acquired their nickname though a cartoon character, \\"Ignaz\\", nicknamed \\"Nazi\\" who was the stereotypical Jew. Before the horror of the reality set in, it seemed a good joke on the posturing, parading, clearly anti-Semitic national socialists to share a nickname with a Jewish cartoon character. Later, Stalin thought up the switch of the applying the Italian \\"fascist\\" designation to German national socialist in order to erase from memory that the Nazis were, in fact, socialist.<br /><br />Fascist just for you information, refers to members of an Italian political party, founded and led by Benito Mussolini, who was expelled from the Socialist Party of Italy and went on to start his own. The structure was a copy, the concept a variant of other socialist parties. \\"Fasces,\\" a bundle of twigs with an ax, were carried before consuls of ancient Rome. Mussolini adopted the symbol, hence the name \\"fascist.\\"<br /><br />Other popular names of Socialist parties are Bolshevik's and Communists. It is interesting to note that in Hungary alone, the communist party went through four complete name changes during its tenure including a fascist label. It is an integral part of socialist operational methodology to make an instant switch once a label has been tainted with \\"mistakes\\" (such as too many atrocities), or when a new compendium of deceptions is about to be announced.<br /><br />Regardless of the name that a socialist party chooses they all have the same elements in common. They are as follows:<br /><br />1. Restriction of Individual Freedom<br />2. A strong central authority<br />3. The usurpation of legislative and judicial prerogative by the executive branch of the government<br />4. Some suspension of property rights.<br /><br />Since Hitler's party and the Mussolini's party both urged the people to go along with all four of the above premises, both the fascist and the Nazi's (National Socialist German Workers Party) was in reality a Socialistic endeavor. To label it conservative is arrantly illogical deduction.<br /><br />Since it is obvious that fascism is NOT against socialism what about the suggestion that it is against feminism?<br /><br />To answer this question one would need the author's definition of feminism to begin with. Unfortunately the author never defines what he means byfeminism, but I find it captivating that the Italian Fascist party was one of the first governments to give women suffrage. It is also amusing to realize that today's radical feminist are many times referred to as Femi-Nazis, alluding to the how the militant feminist are very much likened to the German military.<br /><br />Overall this book is mediocre at best, the facts are present, the interpretation flawed.<br /><br />Caveat Emptor!feminism, but I find it captivating that the Italian Fascist party was one of the first governments to give women suffrage.

McFadden shows how evolution, particularly Darwinian evolution can not have occurred as we hypothesize. He drops the ideology of naturalism and admits quite plainly that cells have order, DNA is information, and there was not enough time to even make a simple cell. I found myself cheering the author on; the intellectual honesty in the first half of the book is breathtaking. The writing and science is lucid, cogent and compelling to the points. But then the unthinkable happens in an otherwise fine book. McFadden leaves his trained discipline of molecular genetics and wanders into quantum mechanics. This is when the book takes a turn for the worse.<br />The major problems become evident, it states with the authors understanding of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. He seems to have defined HUP correctly but his application is incorrect. He than carries on this incorrect application forward and creates a hypothesis based upon a fallacy. The interesting and somewhat paradoxical point is that the author could shed his ideology of naturalism in his field of science but had to reinsert his presuppositions into a field that he is not trained for. Therefore nullifying what could have been a fantastic breakthrough in evolutionary thought.<br />I hope others follow in his footsteps but decide to make the bold connections that are seemingly present while throwing of the constraints of ideology.<br />Overall the first part of the book is great in understanding that a paradigm shift must be made if the evolutionary hypothesis is to remain salient. If these shifts are not adopted we may see the Darwinian evolutionist go down in history as ideological frauds much like the flat-earthers. The second part of the book is lacking due to a misunderstanding of Quantum Mechanics and trying to force science to fit a philosophical ideology.	2004-01-05

I watch very little TV and have never seen Bill O'Reilly on any show. I have also not read any of his other books so therefore I come at his with a clean slate. I am a middle of the road politically, beginning to lean to the right (I think most people do as they get older). With that out of the way let me review the book.<br /><br />This book is really about helping yourself. You see to many people believe that the government is really one giant insurance agency providing insurance for all of their needs, health, retirement, low income (welfare), etc. However, the federal and/or the state governments were neither designed for this nor equipped to do these tasks. Therefore when government attempts to run these programs, they end up being rife with corruption and usually have the opposite effect of what they are intended for. If your understand this you will understand why Bill says that you need to look out for yourself, this does not mean being selfish instead it simply means you should analyze each situation and decide what is best for you.<br /><br />Pretty commonsense stuff if you ask me. So then why all the negative reviews? I think it goes back to the point that most people are just to plain lazy to think for themselves. They are also too lazy to work hard to succeed. These people want everything handed to them on a sliver platter and when things don't go their way, they want to be able to fall back on the `government insurance' programs.<br /><br />To counter many of the hateful and negative reviews that slam Mr. O'Reilly as a right-wing extremist; let me tell you he does NOT come off overly conservative in this book. Logical, thought provoking, insightful, yes; conservative, no. His attacks on G. W. Bush are well placed and not coincidently well deserved. The person who he names as `the gold standard for public service' is ROBERT KENNEDY (69). If Mr. O'Reilly was really this right wing attack dog as many have opined on this web site I wonder why he chose to criticize Bush and praise Robert Kennedy?<br /><br />Perhaps a quote from the book might help explain how the author thinks about things.<br /><br />\\"Finally, the war in Iraq proves once and again that ideologues can never look out for you. They are too blinded by the light on the right or the left and they will never see things for what they really are. If you are become an ideological prisoner, the truth will always elude you because you will never seek it. Instead, you'll evaluate each issue and problem with an agenda: trying to prove your ideology is correct.<br />The antidote to this is to reject a rigid political philosophy and discipline yourself to think logically. Gather facts. Facts always look out for you. And that's a fact.\\" (157)<br /><br />Good job Mr. O'Reillyer why he chose to criticize Bush and praise Robert Kennedy?<br /><br />Perhaps a quote from the book might help explain how the author thinks about things.<br /><br />\\"Finally, the war in Iraq proves once and again that ideologues can never look out for you.

US	50819380	R2KHMEF301QOVS	0192804243	689014669	Atheism: A Very Short Introduction	Books	2	1	3	N	Y	A Very Outdated Introduction	The book starts off rather curiously with an admission that Atheism IS based upon the philosophical worldview of naturalism (see page 16). Naturalism came out of the Greek philosophy called atomism in the 4th century BCE. Naturalism swiftly lost support in ancient Greece because it was philosophically unsustainable and scientifically incongruous. What is most notable is that naturalism's only adherents seem to be those who are Darwinian fundamentalists. (Please note that I said Darwinian and not evolutionary there is a huge difference IE Stephen Gould is an evolutionist but he is not a Darwinian evolutionist and his writings tacitly deny naturalism.)<br /><br />It is fascinating that Mr. Baggini has put all his eggs in one basket. This shows either supreme faith in naturalism or a rather naivet&eacute; of the severe shortcomings of naturalism. Naturalism rests upon the presumption that chance (randomness is the mathematical term) has causal power. In other words, the universe, or anything else, `just is'; there needed not to be a CAUSE for the EFFECT. This is philosophically indefensible. But beyond that it is also mathematical unachievable, for in mathematics there is no such thing as a randomness. (If you doubt this go to any top flight mathematician and ask them to create a random number sequence. The best they will ever be able to do is to create a `recursively random' sequence.) If that doesn’t convince you than stop by the Quantum physics department and they will assure you that the best we have is the illusion of randomness but there is no true randomness that we can find. This isn’t new folks, Albert Einstein knew this when he said<br /><br />&#34;God does not play dice&#34;<br /><br />This quote had nothing to do with a belief in god; rather it is that there is no such event as chance in the universe. NONE, NADA, ZILCH, get the point? So if chance is not causal then what do we have to say about Mr. Baggini's naturalistic atheism? The answer is that majority of his eggs have just cracked. The sad part is that the author and evidentially many of the readers are ignorant of just how the tenets of naturalism have been thoroughly destroyed.<br /><br />The other weak points in the book are Baggini's strawmen attack during the chapter on Moral Arguments. This is NOT an issue as to whether an atheist can be moral as the author suggests, instead the question is WHERE did the morals come from? This is the point that leaves atheists grasping for straws, several book have been written but the ones that make the most persuasive arguments immediately drop any naturalistic pretenses. You cannot have naturalistic evolution and morality as we know it. (Many Darwinian evolutions admit this is the one of the greatest challenges to their hypothesis, hence the popularity and novel constructs of books about this issue.) Baggini's eggs keep cracking.<br /><br />When we get to chapter 6 and the philosophical arguments the reader is left desperate for some sort of logical reasoning. The Cosmological rebuttal that is presented is dated at best and highly disingenuous at the worst. Most 1st year philosophical students could brush aside the logical fallacy used by Baggini and many of the early atheistic thinkers. One would have hoped for at least a better answer than to constrain a creative force to the natural laws inside his creation. If such a deity does exist, it is obvious that it is outside of his creation! The eggs are beginning to leak out of the basket now.<br /><br />The worst argument that atheists seem to rely upon is the Problem of Evil. What is interesting is that many of the top atheistic thinkers today admit that there is no problem with evil and the construct of the Judeo-Christian God - they can both coexist and not be contradictory. But Mr. Baaggini, still in the dark ages of atheistic thought, prances forward the weakest of all arguments at this point. Mr. Baggini wishes to shatter the god of the Judeo - Christian bible with this point, but he makes a fatal mistake by misunderstanding, either purposefully or in ignorance, just how is evil is defined in the bible. What the author does is simply define terms in his way rather than in the context of the bible. (Imagine the arrogance one must have to tell god, I'm taking it that he exists, that his definition of evil is all wrong and he must use mine, WOW.) The more modern and intellectually honest atheist will use the biblical terms of evil and find that they have no argument at all.<br /><br />As we end the book we look down into our basket and realize that there is ONE EGG LEFT intact, the rest of the eggs are smashed to smithereens and the contents have leaked out of our proverbial basket. We also realize that the book did teach us some things, in the beginning the author stated that there are arguments and evidences for both sides but is up to our intellects to sift through the plethora of facts. As we look down at our basket we realize that the arguments and evidences presented for us was of the weakest kind. One that does not support the philosophical, scientific or mathematically hurdles that it encounters.<br /><br />So what is that final egg then??<br /><br />I think the author also gave us the answer. Mr. Baggini posited that FAITH is not about proofs but rather in beliefs where there is no good evidence for it. I believe that the final egg is the egg of faith that Mr. Baggini uses to tell everybody that his basket is full.is point, but he makes a fatal mistake by misunderstanding, either purposefully or in ignorance, just how is evil is defined in the bible.

It demonstrates unequivocally just how hypocritical the left is. Without mincing words, become acerbic, or lowering herself to ad hominem attacks Mona Charen has painted a viciously clear picture of the liberal left. One that may get you angry when you realize how they get a free ride by the liberal press in espousing their anti-American, anti-freedom, anti-liberty claptrap to the masses.<br /><br />I had always wondered why the liberals had such a deep seated hatred of Ronald Regan, this books clarifies the issue. Regan was the arch-nemesis of the left because he attacked their cherished political ideology of communism. Not only did he attack it, but it was his policies and superior guidance of world affairs that brought Russian communism to its death bed. The liberals, especially those in the press who idolized Russian communism, were infuriated at Reagan.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong, this book is not about Reagan, it is about the communist threat and the cold war and how liberals reacted to this challenge. However, Ms. Charen has done her part in helping to illustrate the pre-eminence of Mr. Reagan. It is strange that when Ronal Regan was president, I thought he was an effective leader but not an excellent president. Well history has shown that Mr. Reagan was a superlative leader one with keen insight and intuition.<br /><br />Ms. Charen thanks for the imprinting this memory onto the pages of history for us.	2003-12-19

Therefore, my review is of only the first half of the book.<br /><br />First and foremost Robin Lane Fox is a excellent writer. The books pace and prose was very readable and quite enjoyable. I gave up because Mr. Fox's said purpose was to produce a historical look at the bible. This intrigued me greatly, but as I started to devour the book I found so many historical and exegetical anomalies that I simply lost respect for the contents and found myself relegating this book to a dusty shelf to lie dormant.<br /><br />While I could nitpick I will simply state 3 obvious errors that can easily be dismissed as the ramblings of an ideological prisoner to a false belief system.<br /><br />ONE<br /><br />Mr. Fox suggests that there are two different and irreconcilable accounts of the creation story presented in Genesis. While this novel postulate is not new it has been thoroughly debunked, both logically and hermeneutically. The first Genesis account is from Genesis 1:1 - 2:3 while the second supposedly contradictory one is from Genesis 2:4 - 2:25.<br />The major mistake that is made, is the belief that it is all one timeline from 1:1 - 2:25. However, it is abundantly clear that starting at 2:4 there is a break and the story is retold but this time focusing on man - the subject of the creation. (This by the way is very common in Hebrew literature to show a panoply of the story first and then focus on the main character involved.) But don't take my word on the subject read the first two chapters yourself, you will see!<br /><br />TWO<br /><br />For some reason unbeknownst to me a certain segment of the population love to pull out the Quirinius census debate found in Luke 2:2. Mr. Fox alleges that Quirinius was not governor of Syria until about 6 AD. While it is true that Quirinius did not take over the full governorship of Syria until 6 AD, there is plenty of historical evidence to show that he was governor of Syria from 12 - 2 BC during the military action against the Homonadensians. There is also evidence that Quirinius was given the chore of the census when Augustus ordered it in 8 - 7 BC to help quell the violence in this volatile area of Palestine. Anyway you look at it the honest historian sees no problem with Quirinius being assigned as either governor-pro-tem or as the actual governor during this period<br /><br />THREE<br /><br />This was the final straw that made me close the book. Against all known historical records and evidence Mr. Fox gives the date of authorship for Daniel at `slightly later than 164' BC. This flies in the face of the facts. First, over half of the book is written in Imperial Aramaic. It is with a high degree of accuracy that SECULAR historians can date this Aramaic to the 6th or 5th century BC. The second is that the Septuagint (Greek translation of known Old Testament books) contained Daniel. The Septuagint was codified in the third century BC in Alexandria and it is undisputed that the whole book of Daniel was in the Septuagint. My question is how does anybody who must be aware of the above historical facts date this book at 164BC????<br /><br />This book would be great if it was a work of Fiction, but unfortunately it is being passed off as a historical documentary. If you are unfamiliar with Hebrew and Greek history I suggest you give this book a pass and then to acquire your knowledge from better sources. If you are familiar with history this book could be viewed as an amusing form of fiction or a rather obnoxious attempt at revisionism. I chose the latter and the book is gathering dust.plenty of historical evidence to show that he was governor of Syria from 12 - 2 BC during the military action against the Homonadensians. There is also evidence that Quirinius was given the chore of the census when Augustus ordered it in 8 - 7 BC to help quell the violence in this volatile area of Palestine. Anyway you look at it the honest historian sees no problem with Quirinius being assigned as either governor-pro-tem or as the actual governor during this period<br /><br />THREE<br /><br />This was the final straw that made me close the book. Against all known historical records and evidence Mr. Fox gives the date of authorship for Daniel at `slightly later than 164' BC. This flies in the face of the facts. First, over half of the book is written in Imperial Aramaic. It is with a high degree of accuracy that SECULAR historians can date this Aramaic to the 6th or 5th century BC. The second is that the Septuagint (Greek translation of known Old Testament books) contained Daniel. The Septuagint was codified in the third century BC in Alexandria and it is undisputed that the whole book of Daniel was in the Septuagint. My question is how does anybody who must be aware of the above historical facts date this book at 164BC????<br /><br />This book would be great if it was a work of Fiction, but unfortunately it is being passed off as a historical documentary.

US	50819380	R2KTB7BU86R7PL	1567510884	242788132	Eternal Hostility: The Struggle Between Theocracy and Democracy	Books	2	0	4	N	Y	Internal Credulity	This is a pathetic example of propaganda produced by those with an agenda to foster fear and hostility against any religion that is not their own. To say these types are intolerant and have a narrow, black vs while world-view, while correct, is too simple of a book review so let me go into some detail as to why this book is so poor.<br /><br />Fredrick Clarkson tries to makes the case that virtually anyone who is conservative and also a Christian (religious right) is involved in a sinister plot of planning to overthrow the government of the United States and impose a theocracy. (Cue the sinister music). This is all being done covertly and behind the backs of the ignorant republican party leaders but Mr. Clarkson has seen through this charade.<br /><br />To back up his conspiracy-theory-style charge he uses the first 75 pages of the book to insinuate that everybody on right who is a Christian basically believes the same thing, even though if you read carefully he does mention that the likes of Dobson, the LaHayes, Robertson, Reed, Falwell, etc, have expressly and repeatedly fought against theocracy. Hmmm, Clarkson desperately wants to link these people to theocrats but can’t without boldface lying so he only suggests and to the less than astute reader (look at the glowing reviews) he has succeeded. With the damage is done Clarkson has disingenuously slung mud to every person on the Christian right so that the uniformed and ignorant feel that they are all one giant organization working in concert to destroy America.<br /><br />It isn't until page 76 that Clarkson decides to put some truthfulness out there. He finally stated that it is a very, very, small minority called the Reconstructionist that actually want to impose a theocracy. At first we might think that it is these evil Reconstructionist’s doing the bidding of the theocrats but we would be wrong. We learn during the next 40 pages that reconstructionist believe in an eschatological theory of post-millennialism and NOT all of the reconstructionist believe it is their job to impose a theocracy. But wait truth is stranger than fiction folks, because fiction has to make sense. To prove his point Clarkson rolls out the theocrats all 4, well actually there are 3 because the fourth doesn't believe that man should enact the laws unless there is a call for them. So this whole book is about 3 minor authors who are crackpots and FREDERICK CLARKSON's goal to smear these crackpots' thoughts onto a vast non-homogenous movement of the “Christian right”. This is insane but it gets better<br /><br />With a little further study the reader will find out that all of the major players mentioned before page 76, that have had mud-slung on to them by this guilt by association ploy, actually believe in PRE-millennialism which is assumes that the world will get worse as men turn away from god, these people are expecting the world and its laws to turn their back on Christianity so that Jesus Christ can some as their savior (rapture). This is the exact polar opposite of it getting better by imposing gods will on the people of reconstructionism. But let’s give the author a break, he never said his thoughts would be coherent or logical.<br /><br />To be blunt the reconstructionist movement has about as much chance of imposing a theocracy as the Flat-Earth Society has of re-writing our science textbooks.<br /><br />Unless you have some hatred of Christians you will feel cheated after reading this book, your money will have been wasted, but worst of all you time is gone. The one thing that any thinking person will get after reading this book is that the religious right does not pose a threat on anyone. It is true that there are a FEW crazy's in any group but they simply do not speak the majority.<br /><br />Give this book a pass!ism and NOT all of the reconstructionist believe it is their job to impose a theocracy.

US	50819380	R2GHRJNYS5HU6N	076156375X	398927034	Why the Left Hates America: Exposing the Lies That Have Obscured Our Nation's Greatness	Books	1	118	170	N	Y	A Much Needed Antidote	First a review about the other reviews (something I have never done or felt the need to do but in this case it is warranted) and then a review about the book.<br /><br />MEGLIN1228 & SCOTRUGBY Reviews<br /><br />You need to READ and then THINK and then try to COMPREHEND the book before you review it. If you did you would have found out these things. The book over and over states the difference between liberals, who DO NOT hate America and what the book defines as those on the left, WHO DO. The author continually speaks about the founding fathers and usurpation of the constitution as being a threat to America. One of his strongest points is that the first amendment must be embraced so we CAN HAVE discourse on both sides of the issues. Nowhere does he even suggest the antithesis of this.<br /><br />DUSTIN NEUMAN<br /><br />Each study that I have read has shown the anti-podal of your belief. The higher the IQ the more likely to be conservative, while the lower the IQ the more likely to embrace liberal philosophies. Sorry Dusty, the truth hurts, try to live in reality.<br /><br />PHILLIP<br /><br />1. The author encourages disagreeing with presidents and even gives a great story about Thomas Jefferson encouraging this as a staple of liberty in the book (198-199)<br /><br />2. Questioning war is not anti-American, it is healthy as the author points out, what is anti-American is showing only the worst of war and claiming that this is the norm. (30, 45, 86, 129, etc)<br /><br />3. Please read his book Phillip, you might understand how wrong you are.<br /><br />JOESPH LINDEN & A reader from San Diego<br /><br />You say he forgot to mention \\"slavery\\" Try READING these pages 9, 33-39, 61, 90-96, 126-128, 150 - 158, 178-180, 211. Flynn covers slavery comprehensively; perhaps if you had READ the book you wouldn't seem so ignorant.<br /><br />PHILIP PALMER<br /><br />You have your panties in a bunch about fascism, but if you took time to read the book you would find that Flynn attacks Fascism too. It makes sense since the book is titled \\"Why the LEFT hates America\\" that the author would go after the left's only success in governing, Fascism. For more info. READ 54-57.<br /><br />S ROSS<br /><br />Thank you for reading the book, your review was very well done. Just one comment, you wrote \\"While he makes a strong case that life in the U.S. is better than most developing countries, he conveniently omits almost any comparison to other industrialized nations.\\" The argument THE LEFT has is that WESTERN civilization is worst than NON-WESTERN civilizations, what the author has done is compare America (representing the West) to non-western civilizations. This is the only fair comparison since it responds directly to the left's argument. BTW he does in many cases, go on to compare America afterwards to the likes of Japan, France, Great Britain, Germany, etc.<br /><br />MY BOOK REVIEW<br /><br />First of all the title is BAD and noxious; I wasn't going to read this book because of it, but I was assured by a friend that it was not malicious tripe. I was surprised the writing inside is very good, there is no malice even to those whom the author disagrees with. Instead we have a well researched and fully documented book, complete with footnotes and an index. (Something that is missing in most books from the left)<br /><br />Let's get a few things clear. The author clearly delineates between THE LEFT and LIBERALS and draws a very distinct demarcation line. Once you realize who the author refers to as THE LEFT you can quickly see that it is true indeed that they seem to have a hatred of this country. The book is also quick to point out that liberals are not on the left and questioning this countries actions, or looking critically at its policies in hopes of making the US a BETTER place, is good. (This is actually one of the most even-handed books I have ever read; I sure wish the author had used a different title, I am sure the sale of this book would have gone up to those on the right, since its invective title seems to actually bait the left and turn-off those on the right.)<br /><br />While the book itself is fantastic, its biggest is failure is what S Ross points out it in his review, the book does not answer the question of why does the left hate America? The book does try, but the answer itself leaves the reader wanting something more. But to be fair I don't know if the question can be that easily answerable. I think there are varied reasons for each of those on the left. Fear, greed, desire for totalitarian power, lordship all of these seem to play a role in some way with the left's maniacal need for power. Does the left hate America because it proves their theories wrong? I would say no, but they might hate America because it is stopping them in their desire for world dominance.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />Excellent book, doesn't answer the main question, but the substance inside of it makes up for that.e gone up to those on the right, since its invective title seems to actually bait the left and turn-off those on the right.)<br /><br />While the book itself is fantastic, its biggest is failure is what S Ross points out it in his review, the book does not answer the question of why does the left hate America?

I highly suggest this book over Al Franken book. When you compare the two side by side you realize, that JC is targeting a higher level of sophistication. He disperses with the juvenile swear words and the pedantic ranting that fill AF's book. JC takes the intelligent and reasoned approached one that I prefer over the caustic AF.<br />This does not make the book great though, rather than try to correct every point in the book I have listed just a few brief examples of illogical deductions or downright lies.<br />The Mine Safety and Health Administration did not rescue the miners as JC implied instead it was a combination of volunteers and paid professionals who effected the rescue. (14-15)<br />JC was completely disingenuous in how much the average taxpayer received back in Bush's tax cut. The tax cuts were equal across the board but the best he could come up with is people who paid NO Federal tax got NO money back. HOW UNFAIR! (16-17)<br />To prove that the media isn't biased he states that conservatives actually get to voice their opinions in the editorial sections this is terrible compared to 20 years ago when they were excluded completely (30) and again he is irked that the newspapers even allow conservatives to pen their thoughts. (41)<br />JC asserts that Ann Coutler gets good reviews of her books by the press these are the examples of good reviews:<br />\\"Insult Slinging\\", \\"Sarcastic overhype\\", \\"Piece of agit-pop\\", \\"Pretends to intellectual seriousness where there is none.\\" (32)<br />Wow if those are good reviews I would hate to see the bad ones.<br />JC is very upset that the media might even report that there is a bias (38-39) Shhh don't talk about it and nobody will notice.<br />To prove there is no bias JC shows these rather strange statistics for political endorsements for presidential candidates by Gannett Papers<br />1996 29% of the papers endorsed Bob Dole<br />2000 38% of the papers endorsed George Bush<br />He then follows those statistics up with this quote<br />\\"The trend favors republicans; Bob Dole won many more endorsements that Bill Clinton did in 1996, but not by the margin as impressive as that Bush achieved in 2000.\\" (39-40)<br />Amazing 38% is an IMPRESSIVE margin. Well, NO, JC 38% shows the pervasive liberal bias. Nice try<br />NPR has politically balanced programming (47) STOP LAUGHING I didn't write that JC did, I guess politically balanced programming means that NO right or even middle of the road voice is heard.<br />Another great quote: \\"Conservatives enjoy other vast stretches of uncontested terrain in the national media.\\" (48) His than lists all that he can think of to prove his point: 3 newspapers, 2 magazines, FOX news.<br />That's it folks that's the extreme conservative bias in the news.<br />To prove that CNBC is slanted powerfully to the right JC found that the WSJ ONCE had a show on it. Oh my God, 1 show, on 1 hour, once a week. That is 1 out of 148 hours of weekly programming that was conservative and that makes them slanted powerfully to the right. (48-49)<br />BTW the show was cancelled it is now 148 out of 148 hours of liberal programming. Thank God no more right wing slant.<br />He admits that Dan Rather and the CBS news are liberal (51)<br />Wait a second JC just spent 20 pages explaining that the media was slanted to the right, he even slammed Bernard Goldberg for saying Dan was liberal, but now he admits it. The only conservative voice on the Network or Cable news is FOX and everything else is liberal. Thanks for 20 pages of TRUE LIES.<br />JC is upset that Anne Coutler actually dates men and has many close GAY friends. (113) So much for normal homophobic invectives bandied about by the left.<br />One of my favorite quotes by JC \\"Conservatives cannot compete in the black community because they uphold color-blind principle,civil-quality and the constitution\\" (129) WOW such brutal honest Joe, those damn color-blind, non-racists, constitution believing scum on the right what are they thinking?<br />In the end you are left rather exasperated. It seems that JC thought pattern, like much of other current day liberal authors is, if you repeat a lie often enough it will become the truth. His examples throughout the book are simply stated, PATHETIC. They usually show the exact opposite of his intended point, but it doesn't matter to him or to his INTENDED audience. They have no interest in the truth and even when they are presented facts such as a 38% endorsement for Bush is \\"PREVASIVE\\" conservative bias they simply fall to think what percentage then endorsed Gore?<br />On page 3 JC wrote probably the biggest truth of this book \\"If Americans have a common fault, however, it's our tendency to suffer from historical amnesia.\\" Joe you are right that is how you can claim the Civil Right Act was a liberal victory. The majority of Americans, especially liberal ones, do not know that more liberals voted AGAINST civil rights than conservatives. It's simple facts like these that you turn around and they wage your campaign of BIG LIES.civil-quality and the constitution\\" (129) WOW such brutal honest Joe, those damn color-blind, non-racists, constitution believing scum on the right what are they thinking?<br />In the end you are left rather exasperated.

Books	5	0	0	N	N	Dude, Why am I so Afraid	Dude, Where's my Country<br /><br />Dude, Why am I so Afraid<br /><br />This book is about two things:<br /><br />Fear<br />Taking control of this country<br /><br />The first part of the book is all about fear (1-117) Michael explains to us how he and his liberal friend were paralyzed with fear after 9/11. They lived in constant fear of other attacks, they were nervous and lost. He writes that; all of us were also in this fear, unfortunately Mr. Moore seems to surround himself with liberals, a group that paradoxically has used fear for over a century to control the masses, it now seems that one of the their strongest weapons has turned against them.<br /><br />I feel sorry for the like of Moore and his minions, but if you listen long and hard enough, you can hear their faint and distant cries for help. It's clear they suffer from a unique pathology that is slowly driving them insane. They are, at their core, very, VERY afraid. They are afraid because ultimately, they are ignorant. They are ignorant of much of the world that exists outside their own. This basic ignorance leads to their overwhelming and permanent state of fear. The fear quickly paralyzes them and they become consumed with placating all supposed adversaries. They are too afraid or to selfish to placate their supposed adversaries themselves so instead they wan the government to do it.<br /><br />As a side note how many conservatives lived in fear after the attacks? Very few, if any and the reason is simple conservative live in the real world, they travel they read, they don't have their heads stuck in the sand. They know that terrorism, as sad as it is, is a way of life for many people throughout the world. When a bomb goes off in another country the citizens don't quiver in fear like Moore, they pick up with their lives.<br /><br />Once Michael Moore has you scared to death he then asks this question \\"When are we going to get this country and its economy in our hands\\" (149)<br /><br />To fully understand what he means we must first look at some of the highlights in this book and think whether you want this person telling you what to say, what you can eat, and what you can think.<br />He tries to persuade us that George Bush was linking the 9/11 attack to Osama Bin Laden and provides 9 direct quotes to support this false charge. Not one quote ever mentions Osama's name or implies what Moore is saying. (54-55)<br /><br />Michael admits that Bill Clinton destroyed our military - bad thing. (73) Then complains that George Bush is trying to rebuild it - also a bad thing. (102) Double Fear - fear of being weak and fear of being strong.<br />Michael thinks that 6-7 thousand civilians killed is worst than 2-3 million killed. (75) He did say earlier in the book that most Americans are uneducated; maybe he is proving this point. Or better yet, maybe he just thinks the earth is over populated?<br /><br />He thinks that nuclear plants can blow up like nuclear weapons. (92) FEAR.<br /><br />Thinks TATP, a type of plastic explosive, is detonated by lighting it on fire. (99) Duh, you need a detonator Mikey.<br /><br />Michael is upset that we DID NOT detain more people after 9/11. (20-21) Then he is upset that we detained people after 9/11 (108) I'm so confused.<br /><br />Makes a blanket statement that all rich people are probable terrorist and should be investigated. (116-117) He said it, I didn't!<br /><br />Saddam Hussein was a democratically elected leader. (120) Stop laughing it's there in BOLD print.<br /><br />Doesn't understand that Islam's goal is to exterminate the Jews. (121) Read the Koran and don't be AFRAID to tell the truth Michael.<br />Wants the United States to give free water and health care to the whole world to help make them friendly with us. (122) This is part of the fear complex and placating potential adversaries.<br /><br />Wants to dictate to other countries the rules they should live by. (123-124) He's showing his true socialistic colors now.<br /><br />Wants to destroy all of our weapons of mass destruction because everybody else will of course follow suit. (125) Stupid is as stupid does.<br /><br />Wants to bomb people on the color of their skin. (126) Did I get your attention he wrote it, but it was meant as a joke.<br /><br />Wants to ban certain forms of speech in schools and in public (133-134) I guess MM gets to decide what we are allowed to say and think, whatever he FEARS is off limits.<br /><br />Is upset that people can make money on life insurance when somebody dies. (146) Most of the time the money is used to pay of taxes so your beloved government doesn't seize the family farm or your mom's house. Even worse the whole chapter is that Moore is upset that people make money period.<br /><br />Wants a company to purchase items for people who DO NOT work for them. (147)<br /><br />Was upset that the government didn't help Enron (152) Hey Michael, I thought the government shouldn't bail out businesses you said that in Stupid White Men.<br /><br />Is upset that people who paid ZERO taxes didn't get any tax refund back. (162) Actually if you look at it another way Michael, they got 100% of what they paid back.<br /><br />Tries to prove that this is a very very liberal country this is just one sample of his `mainstream' statistics: 56% say labor unions are good --- drum roll please --- according to a poll taken by the AFL-CIO of ITS union members. (174) Yup NO BIAS THERE.<br /><br />Broad brushes all conservatives as being Racists and war mongers (186) wanting legally accepted date rape (184) and worst of all loving this country (186)<br /><br />If you live in fear and agree with the above statements then you will love this book otherwise.........<br />Wants to destroy all of our weapons of mass destruction because everybody else will of course follow suit.

Most of them hit on one subject and are good like want to know about weather than try Weather Flying by Bob Buck or what about aerodynamics try Skip smiths books Illustrated guide to aerodynamics. Are you a new pilot and don't want to die, try The killing zone. Are you moving up kerosene then try the Turbine pilots flight manual or Fly the wing.<br />But being a CFI/II/MEI this is the set of books that recommend first to all pilots of all capabilities. I have had a 20,000 hour 47 driver tell me he learned A LOT of things from these books. I re-read them just about every year and guess what I learn more and more.<br />If I ever get to meet Mr. Schiff I would like to shake his hand and offer him a heartfelt thank you for making me a better pilot and a better instructor.	2003-11-08

At first I was not that enthralled with this book, okay but not excellent, it seemed that every problem that the liberals have caused could be traced back to the 1960's according to Cal. This just didn't ring true to me I honestly didn't think that today's modern liberals felt and thought the way that the hippie generation did. They have to had changed some of their thinking, after all it was so patently obvious that some of their ideas were downright deleterious to us as Humans and also to the country. I never fault anybody for trying, but once we see what we are doing is not working we need to move on, but liberals are amazing people. Let me explain, I have just read three left wing books in a row, Lying Liars, Dude where is my country and Big lies.<br /><br />And WOW it hit me; the liberal arguments have been the same over and over again. Their solutions are the same over and over again. But this is exactly what Cal Thomas was saying during the whole book. He kept hammering away that this liberal quagmire that has brought drugs, death, poverty, poor education and crime has been going one since the 60's and the same arguments. The answers are still the same but to think that the liberals of 2003 are using the same old arguments and answers that didn't work in the 90's or the 80's or the 70's or the 60's is mind boggling.<br /><br />I never used to think that liberals were stupid, but if you keep putting you hand into the fire and don't learn that fire is hot something is wrong with you.<br /><br />A good book that is useful to combat arrantly illogical liberal arguments. Cogent for today.	2003-11-08

In some cases he has erred on the liberal side of the secular historians sometimes not presenting the cases as strongly as one would think he could.<br />This raises an interesting point in reviewing this book. While I would think that he would rely solely on Christian sources he does not, instead he proves his point in a highly convincing way using Secular sources. I applaud the author and I hope that more of the naysayers and negative reviewers could be so truthful. It would be interesting to see if a liberal scholar could uphold their position using only secular sources. I doubt it, but I don't think they would even try.<br />Anyhow back to this book, I found it fair, historically accurate, slightly dated, but then again any book dealing with history is dated as soon as it is written and best of all enjoyable for those who are non-Christians but enjoy history.	2003-11-08

I read lots of books, both right and left wing, most of them, while not necessarily good are readable. This book is just plain horrific. Perhaps the one underlying theme of this book is FEAR<br /><br />Al seems to be paralyzed with fear. He lives in constant fear of other 9/11 style attacks, he lives in fear of corporations, he lives in fear of conservative book writers and fear of FOX news.. He writes that all us should also be in this fear, unfortunately Mr. Franken seems to surround himself with liberals, a group that paradoxically has used fear and propaganda for over a century to control the masses, it now seems that one of the their strongest weapons has turned against them.<br /><br />I feel sorry for the likes of Al and his minions, but if you listen long and hard enough, you can hear their faint and distant cries for help. It's clear they suffer from a unique pathology that is slowly driving them insane. They are, at their core, very, VERY afraid. They are afraid because ultimately, they are ignorant. They are ignorant of much of the world that exists outside their own. This basic ignorance leads to their overwhelming and permanent state of fear. The fear quickly paralyzes them and they become consumed with placating all supposed adversaries. They are too afraid or to selfish to placate their supposed adversaries themselves so instead they want the government to do it.<br /><br />Since I do not suffer from this fear concept and I do not need a tome of propaganda I found this book to be incipiently tedious.<br /><br />Caveat Emptor	2003-11-08

I do not with everything Mr. Feder has to say, but his writing style is so down to earth. He doesn't use invectives or vitriolic attacks. Instead he very calmly portrays the issues in a commonsense fashion. He then uses LOGIC and REASON to come up with solutions to problems.<br />I think it is the clear cut logic and reason that impressed me the most. Usually you see mental gymnastics performed by those who want to push their ideas and morals onto others. Not in this case, Mr. Feder simply shows a problem, looks at the history of the problem and then shows the logical solution. Pure simplicity.<br />Thank You Mr. Feder for writing a book that makes you smile and makes you think.	2003-08-30

Christopher Tew has unwittingly proven my point by his review of the book and critique of my review. As Mr. Tew states one has to SHARE Mr. Edis's assumptions, in other words we must be locked into a philosophical ideology that refuses to accept empirical evidence contrary to our presuppositions. That was the whole point of my review is that Mr. Edis and Mr. Tew are nothing more than blind materialistic fundamentalist. They ignore verifiable facts just because their ideology takes rule of their lives. This is a dangerous position to be in and one that must be exposed for what it's pure ideological dogmatism. Anyhow, let's discuss the books' and Mr. Tews complaints against Daniel.<br /><br />You should understand that there are three major groups out there that try to date and analyze biblical books.<br /><br />1 The Christians (Those people who believe that the bible is the word of god)<br />2 The Liberal Scholars (This group is made up of people who are trying to show that the bible is completely wrong and manmade.)<br />3 The Secular Historians (The largest of the three groups whose goal seems to be historical accuracy without commenting on the theistic aspect)<br /><br />Group 1 and 2 both have an agenda. Since they are obviously biased a neutral observer would either exclude them or give them little weight. What Tanner and Christopher have done is exclude group 1 AND GROUP 3. They do this because only group 2 SUPPORTS their belief structure. So rather than try to look for errors, a prerequisite for those who relish accuracy and the truth, they prefer to hold tight to their erroneous constructs.<br /><br />So let's look at the facts that group 3, the secular historians have given us.<br /><br />Many fragments of Daniel have been found at Qumran, an evident sign that the book had caused considerable importance in the 3rd century. This alone devastates the author and reviewers argument, but let's continue.<br />Daniel exhibits extensive knowledge of the 6th century events, far more than would seem possible for a 2nd century writer. For Example:<br /><br />1. Babylon was the creation of Nebuchadnezzar.<br />2. Belshazzar was functioning as king when Cyrus took Babylon in 538 BC<br />3. Intimate knowledge in recording the change from punishment by fire under Babylonians to punishment by being thrown to the lions under the Persian regime.<br /><br />As a side note historians used to criticize Daniel for the following items until recent finds have vindicated the books historical accuracy. Conversely, Daniel exhibits no knowledge of 2nd century events, quite curious for a book that is theorized by a few liberal scholars to have been penned in the 2nd century.<br /><br />Daniel uses three (not two) languages; Persian, Aramaic, and Hebrew. The Persian expressions in Daniel are specifically OLD Persian words. Linguists date these old Persian sources to pre 350 BC. This is also evident that the Septuagint translators made inexact, almost guesses as to the meaning of these words. It stretches credulity to believe that Daniel was authored in 167 BC and less than 30 years later the meaning of the words have been lost or forgotten. It is absolutely farcical to assume Daniel was authored, accepted into the canon (this alone averages 100+ years), transported to Alexandria Egypt, translated into Greek all in a scant thirty years. Pleaaaaaase, if you buy this then you also believe that Rome WAS built in a day.<br /><br />Another hurdle with the allegation that the book was written in the 2nd century is that Daniel uses Persian terms for government terminology where one would expect a writer in the 2nd century BC to have employed the current Greek government expressions. Again no explanation is given for this simply because no rational one can be given.<br /><br />The Aramaic in Daniel is what linguists call Imperial Aramaic, as you undoubtedly know language changes greatly over time, just read Lincolns Gettysburg address to get the point. There are several papyri that have been dated around 5 - 6 century BC where the Aramaic matches that of Daniel (see the Elephantine papyri for example). The papyri that have been dated at the 2nd century BC show notable differences. This leads the UNBIASED linguists to date the document as early of the later part of the sixth century BC. As you can see linguistic evidence is clearly against a date in the second century BC.<br /><br />I can continue listing a panoply of evidence that historians use to date this book, but just this small sampling should suffice those who are really interested in learning about history without the philosophical burden of naturalism dictating to them that they must disregard truths in favor of their ideology.<br /><br />In conclusion Mr. Edis and Mr. Tew presents a modified Maccabean view, however a fair and UNBIASED survey of the data seems to indicate that historically, linguistically, and logically a second century date for the autograph of Daniel is extremely difficult to maintain. In essence you can still find people that believe the world is flat, but if you look at the evidence you will reach the conclusion that the world is oval and Daniel was written pre 3rd century BC.<br /><br />Mr. Tew and Mr. Edis have fun in your fundamentalist world of naturalism as for me; I will take the empirical and verifiable evidence and use them to ascertain truth.re are several papyri that have been dated around 5 - 6 century BC where the Aramaic matches that of Daniel (see the Elephantine papyri for example).

US	50819380	R1CDI16S0TQW9	0968601405	865805341	The Jesus Puzzle. Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ? : Challenging the Existence of an Historical Jesus	Books	4	47	77	N	Y	A puzzle with twelve pieces is a pretty easy puzzle to solve	Earl Doherty starts his book by listing 12 conjectures about Jesus. As one examines those 12 conjectures it becomes apparent that the majority of them are based upon the premise that the Gospel were written much later than previously thought. What Mr. Doherty has done is put his proverbial eggs all in one basket. If it can be shown that Mr. Doherty's late dating of the gospels is in error then his whole thesis crumbles before him.<br />In trying to understand how the author came up with his dating, I did some research on my own. (The author does not cite sources in the book, so we are left to guess when it is his opinion or he is trying to assert a fact.) It seems that there are three major groups out there that try to date and analyze biblical books.<br />1 The Christians (Those people who believe that the bible is the word of god)<br />2 The Liberal Scholars (This is how the author refers to this group so for consistency I will also use the term. This group is made up of people who are trying to show that the bible is completely wrong and man made.)<br />3 The Secular Historians (The largest of the three groups whose goal seems to be historical accuracy without commenting on the theistic aspect)<br />Group 1 and 2 both have an agenda. Group one is to prove this is Gods word and group 2 is to disprove that this is gods' word. Since they are obviously biased I excluded them from my research.<br />What I found out is that the Secular Historians DO NOT agree with Mr. Doherty's dating at all. For example this book dates the gospel of Luke at 150+ AD. While the current thinking among historians is that Luke was written before 70AD maybe as early as 60AD. The secular historians back this up because Ignatius writing in 110-115AD quotes Luke directly and the part he quotes is a crucial part of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This goes directly in the face of Mr. Doherty's theory that \\"well into the second century, many Christian documents lack or reject the notion of human man as an element of their faith.\\"<br />Mr. Doherty also picked on the book of Acts dating it around 175 AD completely ignoring the fact that the didache dated around 75-125 AD quotes acts. His dating also flies in the face of the secular historians. What I found out was that Acts has the earliest fragments of any New Testament book it is also regarded as \\"most reliable intact book\\". What do secular historians date Acts? 63-70 AD.<br />Mr. Doherty provides no corroboration or evidential facts for the late dating of these books. As a matter of fact all of the corroborative  evidence, such as the the non-christian sources of Tacitus, Suetonius, Josephus, Thallus, Empreror Trajan, Emperor Hadrian, Lucian and the Christian sources of  Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Quadratus, etc, all universally disagree with Mr. Doherty.<br /> The only one can logically deduce that Mr. Doherty dates the gospel so late is to make HIS hypothesis work. For if the books were penned when the ancient writers and the present historians say they were then Mr. Doherty is wrong.<br />Another bizarre claim that Mr. Doherty makes in this book is that Christianity started with no central theme it just wandered and meandered around for about 200 years before they got there stories right. Again this is a slap in the face of the secular historians who say that Christianity started off with a bang, there were massive conversions to it, many people were put to death over their belief. One thing the historians say they all had in common was very strong core belief system that did not wavier. The epistles many times referred to false teachers who tried to lead astray the Christians. It is crystal clear that the doctrines of Christianity did not evolve but were rather very strong unlike what the author opines in his book.<br />I think it is a disgrace when a person tries to make the facts malleable just so that they can prove their pet theory. This book is inaccurate and misrepresentative of all the knownfacts. Give it a pass.facts. Give it a pass.	2003-07-26

While I was eager for persuasive and compelling arguments I was also expecting that the book would take a fair-minded look at BOTH sides of the issue and then reason convincingly against a war with Iraq.<br />It didn't do that, instead it took every pro-Iraqi statement as being the gospel truth while everything that was damaging to Saddam was relegated as disinformation. After reading the book I felt that I had just read a propaganda guide put out but the Iraqi Information services.<br /><br />Where is the evenhandedness that is fundamental to deliberations of this magnitude?<br /><br />Should not the specifics, both pro and con, be presented? Of course they should, but the book neglects this miserably.<br /><br />I was also looking for a synoptic background of Saddam Hussein and his rise to power. Devoid of crucial background information, the reader is ill-equipped to make any deductions about what potential action(s) should or should not be taken. Remember the old saying: Those who do not know history are apt to repeat it. Regrettably the author believes that there is no relevance in the history of Iraq.<br /><br />I was enthusiastic that the book would delineate how Saddam Hussein has changed and why he can be trusted in the future? In other words, what should be done about Saddam's reign of terror and mass genocide he has performed on people both before and after the Gulf war? It is of somber concern to me that the Dove's do not exhibit compassion for the hundreds of thousands of people who have been tortured, raped and executed by Saddam's regime!<br /><br />Everyone is aware that the most liberal/anti-war organizations have written some of the most damning reports on this regime, for example Max Van der Stoel's who was the UN's special rapportuer for human rights in Iraq, reported to the United Nations that the brutality of the Iraqi regime was \\"of exceptionally grave character - so grave that it has few parallels in the years that have passed since the Second World War.\\" I was expecting the author to give a plan to stop this brutality, but he doesn't instead he is happy to start the book and end the book with anti-war statements from relatives of the 9/11 attack. No offense but what the heck does this have to do with the atrocities going on Iraq? NOTHING!<br />The title said the book would have \\"Ten Reason Against War on Iraq\\" out of the ten reasons that the book supports eight are woefully weak:<br />Reason #4&10 are complete conjecture even their titles prove this by stating \\"War COULD ...\\" any statement of this type can be argued in the converse.<br /><br />Reason #8&9 have no persuasive value whatsoever, they are simply vacuous statements of people who are anti-war. Somebody could just as easily cram a book with statements of people who are pro-war.<br /><br />Reason # 5 \\"Endangering the Kurds\\" is highly embarrassing for the author to pen, for it is the Kurds that have suffered the most at the hand of Saddam. In the authors' bizarre twisted logic, it is tolerable that Saddam gets to torture and kill multitudes of Kurds, but it is atrocious that some may die in a fight to liberate themselves of their merciless totalitarian dictator.<br /><br />Reason #2 \\"No Link Between Iraq and 11Septemeber\\" is a strawman attacks. It is the anti-war side that continually links 9/11 to this war. The Bush administration has been unequivocal in the fact that they see no connection between al-Qa'eda or Bin Laden and Saddam.<br /><br />Reason #3 \\"This is Not About Regime Change\\" This also is an anti-war strawman attack. For it is the anti-war camp who say this is a vendetta against Saddam and we will leave the rest of his people in power. Again in completely clear and unambiguous statements the Bush administration has continually said their goal is regime change.<br /><br />Reason #1 \\"No Evidence Iraq has these Weapons(WMD)\\" this is by far the most ludicrous and evident fabrication in the book. The author simply disregards 98% of the Untied Nations reports. He also overlooks all of the illegal shipments of banned weapons and weapon parts that have been seized going into Iraq since 1991. The proof is extant; this reason is farcical.<br /><br />This leaves us with only two reasons that are slightly compelling.<br />Reason #6 \\"War would be Illegal\\". Here the author quotes the UN Charter Use of Force and this would seem to be forceful. However, there appears to be some legally convincing reasons for war such as:<br /><br />1925 and 1949 Geneva Convections (Treatment of prisoners, use of WMD, purposeful targeting of civilians)<br />Violation of the Vienna Conventions of diplomatic and consular relations<br />Violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty of 1993<br />Violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention<br />Violation of UNSCR 687<br /><br />The legal principle of \\"anticipatory self-defense\\" is also applicable.<br />The above are 7 WELL KNOWN arguments for a LEGAL war; the book should have given at minimum a cursory attempt to discredit one of them!<br /><br />Reason #7 \\"Iraq's Neighbors Fear Bush, Not Saddam\\" While the title and the authors assumption are patently false (he refers to the governments when he says neighbors), I think that a case could be made that this war could turn highly unpopular with the Arab \\"Street\\". This should be taken into account as a possible reason against a war; however the authors sloppy linkage of Arab government and the Arab \\"Street\\" only shows a widespread misunderstanding of politics and/or an extreme ignorance of the facts.<br /><br />For those yearning for an evenhanded treatment of facts about this multifaceted and difficult issue this is NOT your book.

While this is an interesting and novel way to say this war is illegal it would be easier to quote UN Charter Article 2 (paragraph 3 and 4) for this certainly has more weight than the authors argument.

The authors simply disregard 98% of the Untied Nations reports. They also overlook all of the illegal shipments of banned weapons, weapon parts, and logistical components that have been seized going into Iraq since 1991. The proof is extant; and well documented.

He does this by renaming naturalism as a guiding force for all scientists. Don't believe me than simply read his book on page 98 he defines science as:<br /><br />\\"Science is a specific way of thinking and acting common to most members of a scientific group, as a tool to understand information about the past or present.\\"<br /><br />Compare that definition to this one<br /><br />\\"A particular system of principles for the conduct of life common to members of the same belief system. This system is used to process information and form opinions within that belief system.\\"<br />The above definition is Webster's definition of philosophy and now compare that to Webster's definition of Science<br /><br />\\"Systematized knowledge derived from observation, study, and experimentation carried on in order to determine the nature or principles of what is being studied.\\"<br /><br />It should be crystal clear that Michael Shermer while pretending to speak about science does not; he instead is speaking about philosophy. It is also clear that Mr. Shermer wants desperately to put down anything that does not fall into his philosophical worldview as bad science he is only showing his supreme ignorance of what science is and is not. This book as I stated above is not about science or pseudo science it is simply a book about one man's philosophy being the driving force behind his very existence. While this, by itself is not bad, it is the insistence that this philosophy is not a philosophy at all but really true science. This must exposed for what it is.<br /><br />In reality I feel sorry for Mr. Shermer and scientist who are bound by the presuppositions of naturalism. Because the sad part of naturalistic belief system is that it precludes the scientist from using all of the available empirical and verifiable data as his or her disposal. It insists that they sit in a box and are only allowed to view the items in their naturalistic box. Anything that falls outside the box, even if they know it is true and has been proven to be true has to be at best ignored or at worst falsified into a non-eventuality. The bottom line is that the naturalistic scientist cannot use all the evidence at his disposal so his theories or constructs are at best weak due to the inability to view the panoply of events around him. The most curious item about naturalistic scientist is their insistence that their philosophical presuppositions make them unbiased. When in reality they are being controlled by materialistic ideals and not allowed to venture out of there box.<br /><br />I am not trying to dissuade anyone from reading this book, I just thought a little clarity should be brought to the table.It insists that they sit in a box and are only allowed to view the items in their naturalistic box.

Interesting, I put myself though a 4 year university working part-time as a food server for a national restaurant chain. My average tips paid for schooling, books, an apartment (fully furnished on the beach) a car (2 year old Toyota tercel), a trip to Jamaica and a graduation trip to Europe. Oh I didn't mention the state I worked in during the 1990's had a tip credit so my wage was $2.01 a hour. I must have been really poor.<br />But this book isn't about getting by, which can be done very easily if you budget correctly. Instead this book is about bashing the majority of Americans. It is about bashing us because we have pride in the job that we do. To Barbara Ehrenreich any person who works for another is demeaning themselves. She uses the salary she is paid as a smokescreen to put forward her abnormal views on the work ethic of Americans.<br />This book is an affront to anyone who works, I personally don't like being put down because I have pride in my job. Maybe, just maybe that is why all those people who do have pride in their work seem to move up the company ladder and become moderately successful while those like Ms. Ehrenreich seem to stagnate at the bottom, bitter and upset, never wanting to put forward the effort to EARN something more for themselves.	2002-11-23

Books	4	32	58	N	N	Good Book - Exposes the Lunacy	...P>I will give credit to the author that he does seem genuine in his positions and was willing to take risks in asserting dubious statements as facts. This at least shows that he has guts and that is something that I can respect him for. With that being said I will detail the main point that the author got right that a lot of citizens of the Unites States of America have not realized yet.<br />#1 The Republicrats and Demicans are nearly identical parties. Many people prefer to call them Socialist Party A and Socialist Party B. Mr. Moore does a decent job in delineating the sameness of the parties, however he does it from an extreme leftist position. Mr. Moore is so far to the left that just about everybody and everything looks like a right wing position. Mr. Moore tries to show that the Democratic Party has moved to the right, certainly this point is highly questionable at best. With that being said, the author and  I at least agree with his premise that they are basically identical parties. And we defiantly need to see some party that will rise up and be PRO-AMERICAN rather than the ANTI-AMERICAN socialistic parties we have now.<br />Reviewing this book is tricky due to the enormous amount of internal inconsistencies in this book. (This is a large problem in reviewing almost any book that has a decidedly socialist agenda due to the relativistic nature that socialist put on the truth and facts. A socialist views the truth and malleable and has no problem contradicting himself over and over again. This of course poses a problem for those on the right since they view truth as a non-bending principal.) A few examples of the internal inconsistence are:<br />IS THE ECONOMY GOOD<br />\\"There is no recession, my friends. No downturn. No Hard times. The rich are wallowing in the loot they've accumulated in the past two decades, and now they want to make sure you don't come a-lookin' for your piece of the pie.\\" (50)<br />OR<br />IS THE ECONOMY BAD<br />\\"Part of the reason you're hearing so much about how bad the economy is these days is that many of those who are getting their pink slips are friends and family of those reporting the bad news\\" (54)<br />CAN'T HAVE A TREATY WITH A KAPUT COUNTRY<br /> \\"No, Sally, the Soviet Union isn't our enemy. The Soviet Union has been kaput for ten years. . . . \\" (106 ellipsis in original)<br />OR<br />CAN HAVE A TREATY WITH A KAPUT COUNTRY<br />\\"He started a new Cold War with Russia by actively preparing to violate the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaties of the 1970's\\" (164 - by the way Mike, The treaty was with the Soviet Union, which as you know, see quote above, that the country is no longer around.)<br />A PRESIDENT WHO USES MIND ALTERING LEGAL SUBSTANCES IS BAD<br />See pages 39-42 for Mike's diatribe against George W. Bush's drinking.<br />OR<br />A PRESIDENT WHO USES MIND ALTERING ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES IS COOL<br />\\"We were all relieved that the Regan/Bush years were over, and it was kind of cool that we had a President who had smoked pot\\" (211)<br />I will end this review with just a few random points:<br />#1 George W. Bush won the election using our constitutional electoral ballot system. Mr. Moore believes that a popular vote is used to elect presidents. (2)<br />#2 The Florida election was originally called for Gore not Bush. (7)<br />#3 Military ballots cast in a federal election fall under federal rules for overseas ballots not states rules. The military ballots were legal; even Gore's Attorneys tacitly admitted this. Mr. Moore unfortunately does not know the law and would rather have the legally cast votes of our brave soldiers who are protecting our freedoms that he takes for granted, not count. (10-11) (Remember Mike is more concerned that Convicted Felons, you know those people who rape and kill your grandmother, get a fair chance to vote because they vote for democrats.)<br />HEY, just a thought: Why do protectors of freedom vote conservative while destroyers of freedom vote liberal?<br />#4 Mr. Moore thinks that independent Palestinian nation will stop the fighting in Israel. By the way Mike the Palestinians were given there own independent nation in 1947. They turned it down of course so that they continue to follow their stated goals of the total extermination of the nation of Israel. Kind of hard to negotiate peace with an opposition who says we will only have peace when you are dead. (180-181)<br />#5 Mr. Moore believes that we need to spend more money on education and this will solve the problems. Wake up Mike, the United States of America spends more money on a per pupil basis than any other country in the world. It's not the money buddy, it's the curriculum. This isn't about poor teachers or shoddy school building it's about a methodological dumbing down of our students by design. Remember Clinton's Goals 2000? Read it and the UNICEF education plans and you will be amazed, the system is performing as it is intended to. (That's why all the rich liberals send their kids to private school, they designed the system)<br />#8 On page98-99 Mike encourages students to be different, go against the trends, be unique then on page 206 he criticizes the United States for being different, going against the trends and being unique. America must conform to what other countries tell it to do!<br />I hope I didn't turn anybody off of the book. I will be giving several copies to friends, it exposes just how radical and illogical the extreme socialists (whoops, in deference to Michael Moore we should call them the green party) supporters can be. This book will do wonders to help those of us on the RIGHT side of the issues.r. Moore thinks that independent Palestinian nation will stop the fighting in Israel.

US	50819380	RYUDMKERLGQNT	0967996317	609489414	Tracon	Books	4	6	12	N	N	Good fiction despite the flaws	This book is written in a very simplistic prose, the pace is fast and the story lines are simplistic. The author is an entertaining writer, one who can lead you on to the next chapter and make you wanting more. However there are some flaws in the book. The author has set up the press as the knight in shining armor. While the government is really just trying to help people regardless of how the truth may hurt them. And the only villain, you guessed it a republican senator looking out for big business (I guess nobody told the author that the democrats take more campaign contributions from big businesses than the republicans do).<br />With these intricacies aside I wonder if the author has ever flown on a plane with a TCAS I or a TCAS II system? I also wonder if he has ever thought like a pilot, every conflict resolution he mention revolved around a vertical component of flight (climb or descend). Never once did it come to mind that there is a horizontal component of flight (turn right or left). This is interesting, since the majority of traffic alerts are resolved or simply not allowed to happen with simple commands such as \\"Delta 123 turn left 30 degrees for traffic\\". But this wouldn't be exciting for a book to be written about.<br />Overall, this book is fun to read if you take it as fantasy. If you take it as a probability then the fatal flaws destroy the premises and make the book a dull read.	2002-08-08

I was very impressed with Christopher Hitchens prose and syntax that he employs in the penning of this short essay. It is appreciated that the author does not &#34;dumb down&#34; his writing in hopes of finding greater mass appeal. With that being said lets discuss the merits of the postulates that Mr. Hitchens promotes.<br /><br />&#34;Triangulation is the art of diving the mid-point between an elite intent on maintaining privilege and an electorate that stubbornly insists on taking its place at the table&#34; this is the definition of triangulation put forward by the author. And one that I might add accurately portrays the neo-socialist thought. Hitchens, Clinton and all socialists realize that for them to preserve their pedestal of power in the oligarchy they must toss scraps from the table to the proletariat who &#34;insist on taking its place at the table&#34;. While Mr. Hitchens admits this he then rather naively expects Bill Clinton and the like to have the same morals or at least moral reasoning capability of discerning right from wrong or fact from fiction. However that assumption begs the question of &#34;Is there truth?&#34; Of course the whole theory of truth is a quixotic philosophy that the left relegates to the dung pile of dark-age religions. So than what baseline or level field does the left use in coming up with its theories, this is of course the infallibility of human reason.<br /><br />And since no sane person would argue that human reason governs supreme; religion and morality have no place and no legitimate function, and indeed, such is the socialistic position. Right and wrong become arbitrary categories, &#34;subject to change without notice.&#34; The same applies to values and, ultimately, to facts. Truth cannot survive in the scenario. Consequently, telling the truth is no longer a requirement, and taking an oath carries no meaning. So rather than triangulation as Mr. Hitchens postulates what has affected Bill Clinton and the vast majority of the socialist is an abstract subjective idea of truth. They view truth as a pliant concept one that is malleable to the occasion at hand. This does not mean that triangulation was not used by Bill Clinton, au contraire, he as many socialist like him, have used it in the past to appease the masses. It will always be a tool used by the oppressor to the oppressed; it is just that Mr. Hitchens has erred in delineating Mr. Clinton's use of triangulation and that of Bill's constant prevarications.<br /><br />There are some good points in the book<br /><br />1. Lying, even as means to the end, is wrong<br />2. Killing people (launching cruise missiles and such) to cover up Bimbo eruptions and more prevarications is arrantly more evil than above.<br /><br />However, there are some rather indefensible assumptions that are put forward they are as follows:<br /><br />1. Clinton willing signed the welfare reform.<br />2. Clinton was really a conservative or at least very middle of the road president.<br /><br />As for anyone who was breathing during Clintons tenure as Liar in Chief is well aware that is was the Republicans who swept into congress and then carried out 9 out of the 10 items in the contract with America. Clinton was virtually powerless to stop a reform bill that was backed by the majority of the electorate. If Clinton did not sign the bill his presidential power would be in imperil and the people who got him elected would have lost the confidence in him. Welfare reform was triangulated away in Clintons mind by explaining to the governed that welfare recipients do not generally vote therefore if we lose any of them out of the party it will not matter.<br /><br />The second idea is that Clinton was really a conservative or at least a very moderate president. To justify this point Mr. Hitchens highlights the health care debacle claiming that this shows once and for all that Clinton masqueraded as a republican. But again, what do the facts (the nonmalleable ones)say. Bill Clinton and other neo-socialists have known for many decades that government will never be able to take over businesses and succeed; therefore they needed a new paradigm one which it would appear that the business was running the business part while the government just stood back and watched. But looks are deceiving since we know that is not the plan. The neo-socialist plan upon creating mega-corporations and then allowing them to work symbiotically with the government, these corporations will become indispensable to the public and in the public’s eyes be free of government intrusion. However, these corporations will only exist in arenas where the government has allowed them to, and usually the main if not total source of their income. Rules and regulations will be used to stifle competition or to punish bad corporations that don't follow the whims of the oligarchy.<br /><br />With this in mind let us look at what Co-Presidents Hillary's health care plan would have done. At first there would be only FOUR health care companies left in the US. It would be up to them to supply health care to all of us citizens who have asked for &#34;scraps from the table&#34;. The government would be responsible for the health (payment) of the corporation plus also be responsible for the rules governing the corporations. Pretty soon only the corporation who could most satisfy the whims of the personage in power would be left. This is a picture perfect idea of neo-socialism and this is why those who implore the use of free-markets were up in arms over this collaboration of government and business.<br /><br />So there is one obvious question left to ask: Is Mr. Hitchens childishly ignorant of what the goals are of the political ideology that he stands in firm agreement with are? Or does he really know the truth and is a master at obfuscation claiming that those items that are most socialistic in nature are in reality promoting free markets the antipodal of socialism?say.

Books	5	22	26	N	Y	A Work of Brilliance and Infallible Logic	While many authors seem to have written countless book before they final pen a magnum opus, it seems that Mr. Vazsonyi burst upon the literary world with a book that eloquently defines the difference between the two different political ideologies that are extant in the world today. The two ideologies according to the author are what have come from the Franco-Germanic school of thought versus the other that is based upon the Anglo-American philosophy. If there is a downfall of the book it is that the author has penned his tome to those that have a requisite knowledge of world and political history. It also presupposes that one has watched and understood the paradigm shift that Socialist entities (Communist, Fascist, Nazi's, and Bolshevik's) have taken over the last ten years. With that being said and if you are an intelligent observer of world politics this book is easily digested and imparts a plethora of political savvy upon the reader<br />At this point I am at a loss of how to review this book anything that I write will do a disservice the original text therefore I will just cull some quotes out of the book that I think will give the reader a fair assessment of the authors style and wisdom.<br />The frames of the Constitution understood the wisdom of making few laws. The fewer the laws, the broader the agreement.. The broader the agreement, the less need for enforcement. The less enforcement, the less friction between government and the governed. And the less friction, the less waste of time and energy. The time and energy thus freed vastly increase people's creative capacity.<br />That, in a nutshell, is the success story of the United States of America. (49)<br />Under a variety of labels, the former (Franco-Germanic thought) is unconcerned with the human nature, and seeks only those outcomes it considers \\"desirable.\\" The latter (Anglo-American thought) has always engaged in creating the circumstances that, based on human nature and empirical evidence, will offer the best chances for individual success. While the later holds that successful individuals will constitute a successful society, the former believes that a good theory will produce a \\"good\\" society - communism being the ultimate \\"good society.\\" (67)<br />Once again, the more groups we have, the more \\"rights\\" we have. The more groups we have, the farther we drift from the rule of law. The more groups we have, the more restrictions we have on our true rights: Individual rights.<br />Individual rights reflect our similarities; group rights emphasize our differences. Individual rights promote equality; group rights cultivate inequality. Individual rights permit every one of us to be special; group rights create stereotypes. Individual rights are unalienable, and are guaranteed by the Constitution; group rights are born at activist rallies, conferred by a party-political executive branch, and confirmed by a temporal judge. Group rights can be taken away be an even louder rally, a different regulator, a new judge.<br />Individual rights and group rights are mutually exclusive; we can not have it both ways.<br />Individual rights provide a sense of security. The greater the sense of security, the more of people's creativity will be converted to productivity. The higher the productivity, the greater the sense of independence.<br />Group rights instill fear. The greater the fear, the more the limitations on human activity. The greater the limitations the more total the dependency on the wielders of regulatory power.<br />Group rights - invented rights, that is - come, of course, with an important financial dimension. The bearer is entitled to unearned benefits - more directly put, to the fruits of other people's labor. Of greater significance, however, is the gradual destruction of society by the fear that attends group rights. (78-79)<br />Individual rights make up the foundations of liberty. Individual rights impose limitations on power. Individual rights had to be, indeed came to be, the first \\"slice of the salami.\\" The dismantling of individual rights occurred through the establishment of group rights.

There are numerous errors throughout the book but probably the most egregious is the authors link of Fascism to the right wing. While this may be the political fantasy of any and all true socialists it is far from the truth. But lets get into the debate immediately and see if we can bring some Fact to this work of fiction.<br /><br />First of all the author incorrectly calls the German Nazi's a fascist party. This is so absurd that it is easily rebuffed here, but first let me give a little history. The term NAZI was a nickname given to the members of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Socialist is the operative word here.) This is of course Hitler's outfit, which formed the core of the Third Reich. National Socialists are just another variation on the theme of Socialism and they acquired their nickname though a cartoon character, &#34;Ignaz&#34;, nicknamed &#34;Nazi&#34; who was the stereotypical Jew. Before the horror of the reality set in, it seemed a good joke on the posturing, parading, clearly anti-Semitic national socialists to share a nickname with a Jewish cartoon character. Later, Stalin thought up the switch of the applying the Italian &#34;fascist&#34; designation to German national socialist in order to erase from memory that the Nazis were, in fact, socialist.<br /><br />Fascist just for you information, refers to members of an Italian political party, founded and led by Benito Mussolini, who was expelled from the Socialist Party of Italy and went on to start his own. The structure was a copy, the concept a variant of other socialist parties. &#34;Fasces,&#34; a bundle of twigs with an ax, were carried before consuls of ancient Rome. Mussolini adopted the symbol, hence the name &#34;fascist.&#34;<br /><br />Other popular names of Socialist parties are Bolshevik's and Communists. It is interesting to note that in Hungary alone, the communist party went through four complete name changes during its tenure. It is an integral part of socialist operational methodology to make an instant switch once a label has been tainted with &#34;mistakes&#34; (such as too many atrocities), or when a new compendium of deceptions is about to be announced.<br /><br />Regardless of the name that a socialist party chooses they all have the same elements in common. They are as follows:<br /><br />1. Restriction of Individual Freedom<br />2. A strong central authority<br />3. The usurpation of legislative and judicial prerogative by the executive branch of the government<br />4. Some suspension of property rights.<br /><br />Since Hitler's party and the Mussolini's party both urged the people to go along with all four of the above premises, both the fascist and the Nazi's (National Socialist German Workers Party) was in reality a Socialistic endeavor. To label it conservative is arrantly illogical deduction.<br /><br />Since the author's main conclusion are drawn from such falsehoods the whole book is suspect and can be passed by and nothing but a propaganda front for the new-socialist.lone, the communist party went through four complete name changes during its tenure.

It is a book that every person who is in the Republican Party should, NO, must read. The book also helped vindicate many of my feelings that I had after I switched parties several years ago. First of all Mr. Novak tells us that the Republican Party is great (or was great; maybe I'm more pessimistic than he is) because it stands for principals. This is in contrast to the liberal parties whose only principal that they seem to have is that they have NO PRINCIPALS. Since the left has no standards it is truly a malleable plaint propaganda front used to inculcate the masses to a life of extreme bondage under the guise of egalitarian socialism.<br /><br />Back to the book review, Mr. Novak puts forth the conjecture that when the right buys the distortion of the left that the only way it will win elections is to become more centrist in nature, they are in effect destroying the core of the philosophical ideals of the right. Remember, the left over the years has slid farther and farther into the deadly grips of socialism until ideas that were consider middle of the road 20 years ago are now re-characterized as extreme right wing today. The democrats continually try to paint the conservatives as radicals when in reality it is the democrats that have slid into an ultra liberal position and it is they who have become the radicals. What is amazing is that the Republicans have bought into the lie and feel that they must become more middle of the road. So in essence we no longer have two distinct political parties anymore, instead we have Socialist Party A and Socialist Party B. Or in other terms the Republicrats and the Demicans. It is because of this shift to the left that myself and quite a few others that I know have changed party affiliation.<br /><br />Mr. Novak is aware of this problem and has put forward ten ideas that if the Republican Party embraced they would begin to win elections again. Not only would they win elections they would see a renewal of zeal similar to the Reagan revolution. The ten postulates are as follows:<br /><br />1 Use the budget surplus to cut taxes for everyone.<br />This is probably the biggest no brainer on the list. Lower taxes mean less government (socialistic) programs for the masses. Less government means less intrusion and fewer bureaucrats, fewer bureaucrats mean more productivity and wealth for everyone.<br /><br />2 Endorse a national sales tax to replace the internal revenue code.<br />In fact I disagree with the national sales tax, but the point is to scrap the IRS code as it is now and replace it with something incredibly simpler. Again, less chance for the government to get you money means less chance that the government will have control over you.<br /><br />3 Establish true personal accounts for Social Security.<br />Social security is here to stay, so why not let it work for you rather than against you.

While Mr. Goldberg's book is a New York Times Bestseller I truly wondered why after reading it. There is nothing inherently wrong or bad about this book, The writing is fast paced even though the author does seem to have a personal vendetta against Dan Rather, this can be overlooked easily and didn't take away from the main thesis. My disappointment lies in the fact that it just isn't very groundbreaking or earth shattering. It basically shows what you can watch overnight on the news or read everyday in the newspapers. The press has a liberal bias.<br />For those who have not read the book, Mr. Goldberg does a good job in presenting several examples of the liberal media BIAS that is inherent to most of the major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN). He does a great job in telling the reader that the liberal BIAS is not some secret conspiracy to inculcate the masses in the benefits of socialism. Instead he does stay clear of invectives and shows that the only reason the mainstream media has such a implicit liberal slant is because that is simply how the reporters are. The majority of reporters are radically left of center so that when they report the news it just comes naturally for them to add their extreme leftist views to their reporting. By the way, Mr. Goldberg does not tackle the issue of the truly partisan propaganda machines who are posing as news outlets (NPR, PBS, Etc.) The saddest part of these propaganda machines is that the very governments that they are trying to destroy funds the majority of them through taxpayer dollars.<br />I would like to think, the majority of the citizens of the United States who turn on the television and discerningly watch the nightly news realize that it is presented with a liberal bias. I have friends both, conservative and liberal, who acknowledge this fact. What I don't understand is that why this book has turned out to be such a hit. When I read it I came away thinking: \\"Yeah so, everybody knows this.\\" So what is the reason behind the success?<br />I came up with a theory even though I may be wrong I will put it forward here. It is a disheartening postulate and I hope it isn't true but here it goes. There may be some, maybe quite a few people on this planet that did not realize that they were being spoon-fed liberal propaganda each night. I personally can't imagine anybody not realizing this, it would be truly sad to think so, but I am at a loss as to explain the rabid success of this book and some of the reviews that have been written here. While this may seem a simplistic theory I have no other ones to put forward. If this theory is correct than this book serves a very powerful purpose and it should be a New York Times Best Seller.<br />So who should buy this book, it is for those who have doubts about the liberal bias in the media or if you do not know that there is liberal bias in the media. These individuals will gain much insight out of it and will of course start looking for some alternate news sources immediately. On the other hand if you look at the title and say \\"What's New\\" then you may be disappointed in this book, your money may be better spent elsewhere.h so, everybody knows this.\\" So what is the reason behind the success?<br />I came up with a theory even though I may be wrong I will put it forward here.

The books presentation of information is very disordered however, it becomes crystal clear after only a few chapters that rather than being a scholarly critique this book is a vitriolic attack against Judeo-Christian values and their perspective religions. I for one was hoping for a book that showed factual presentations and coherent argument either for or against the separation of church and state instead I got an opine of the author. While this book may appease `the choir' it does nothing for those who are seeking intelligent discourse in a prickly argument.<br />I brought this book because I was interested in Mr. Boston's interpretation of Thomas Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptists where he penned the metaphor \\"separation of church and state\\". Although the book, whose title suggest this would be the main issue, does touch on the subject it is definitely one that the author has much interest in writing about. Yes Mr. Boston gives you a brief background, one that seems to be lacking in historicity of the event, and then Mr. Boston gives you his interpretations of the letters but he never provides you with the original letters. I wondered why a book whose main thesis is built up on \\"the separation of church and state\\" never reproduced the famous documents? It wasn't until I looked them up myself and read them in the original form that the context became crystal clear.<br /><br />The main reason Mr. Boston dare not include them in his book is that the original letters destroy Mr. Boston's interpretation and therefore his credibility.<br /><br />I suggest that anyone who has been duped by this carefully laid out propaganda, and many have just look at the reviews, they need to go back and reread the letters in question.	2002-02-17

Does that make it a bad book? NO. It interprets the facts with a right with viewpoint that's all. Perhaps the best chapter in the book is the one that most people of the left have the hardest time defending; that is the US Supreme Court decisions that the media has labeled 5-4. The author, rightly (no pun intended) shows that the decision was in reality 7-2 and very unbiased. This is probably the most important point in the book and seems to be overlooked by many reviewers.<br />As far as the legal shenanigans that went on, either side, right or left, would have done those. But again, the most important issue is the Supreme Court decision and how quickly it has been spun into the American mind that it was a partisan 5-4 decision.	2002-01-18

The book does show that many people do tribalize around their victimhood. In other words they have status because they are a victim of some supposed ill of society. (I'm black, I'm a women, I have gray hair, Or perhaps the most ironic I'm a American Caucasian living in southern California)<br />Mr. Sykes shows elegantly that the \\"not my fault\\" syndrome has become the law of the land. However the book fails in showing that this syndrome seems to be an effective gathering agent of the socialist class. In order to have a more egalitarian society the socialist must employ the tactics that the author puts forward. It is the great equalizer in the left's battle against freedom. For in reality, at least for the socialist, we are all victimized by our capitalistic system. Therefore the only way the underperforming of society can get ahead is by invoking the government to help them. IE become a victim.<br />This book is groundbreaking in the fact that it challenges many notions that go against the politically correct view. However it does not go far enough in connecting the dots. I do recommend it though it is a easy read that shows eloquently some common sense on the issues of victimization.	2002-01-18

Would this just be a hatchet job on our ex president? The cover and title seemed to indicate that it was going to be a very one-sided right wing slam blaming every thing wrong in the world on anti-Christ Bill. But what I found out was a book that was extremely fair. The author even seemed in some strange way enamored by President Clinton's charisma and his obvious political skills. She paid kudos to him for the way he managed the government during his tenure in office, praising him for keeping a robust economy and a fairly good job at handling foreign affairs. Ms. Olson was in no ways vindictive to the ex-chief.<br />What the author did do though was provide a synopsis of the dealings of Mr. Clinton during his last days in office. There was no specious charges brought out by this book. As a matter of fact all the allegations brought up by Ms. Olson are known and proven to have occurred. What the author has done is culminated many of the main factual news stories into a book showing the tawdry dealings of our Ex-President.<br /><br />One of the best points of the book was the complete lack of hyperbolic arguments or vitriolic chatter from the author. It was obvious that none was needed since the ex-presidents actions speak loudly enough. However, she does quote many of the Clinton apologists near the end of the book. And it is very fascinating that once Clinton was out of office his staunchest supports began to spew forth such verbal tirades and denunciations against him and his amoral actions. (Perhaps it is these quotes from liberals that many of the negative reviewers have confused as the authors thoughts???)<br /><br />Anyhow, I gave the book only 4 stars because I think it lacks depth in discussing the most pernicious action of the president in his last few days in office. That is the issuing of executive orders or legislation by presidential fiat if you will. While Ms. Olson does spend one chapter discussing these issues she only hits a few of the goodies that William Jefferson Clinton signed into law. For any conscientious American I suggest you search out all the EO's that were signed. They are easily available on the web. Once you have read them you to will be outraged at the abuse of this privilege.<br /><br />I hope that all Americans have learned their lesson from the incorrigible megalomaniac we had in the White House.<br /><br />Character does count not political party affiliation.sing these issues she only hits a few of the goodies that William Jefferson Clinton signed into law.

First off the author is an excellent writer and keeps the book moving along. He gets into the personalities of the team members and when you do SAR work you realize that it is the interrelationships of the team personal that make or breaks your team. I think Mr. Clifford does a good job in detailing the day to day nuances of the characters in the book.<br />I also think that he portrays a realistic look at the tensions that arise between the NEEDED paramilitary Sheriffs department and the free-spirited rescuers. The facts are that the SAR Teams are going to become more and more under the direct aegis of the Sheriff departments. That means more liability issues will be raised and in turn more Certifications will be needed to be a member of any SAR team. While this may be a noble objective it also had the direct dilemma of ostracizing the competent members on any SAR team. I have seen it happen, so sometimes the net result is a SAR team will lose some competent people only to be replaced by individuals that have passed the minimum sheriffs department certifications. While technically these individuals are qualified to perform a rescue they are as inept as any mountain neophyte is and in most cases a liability to the team. But this is the wave of the future and a reason why the author sees SAR teams being staffed only by paid people.<br />One caveat for the any Non SAR person. This book does glamorize the work and makes it seem as non-stop action. I understand that the book has to do this otherwise it would be a bore to read. But real SAR work can be tedious and hard, no limelight, many days spent traipsing through buckthorn or on the side of some rattlesnake-infested ridge. You will come home on many days, dirty and tired, with fresh scrapes on your hands and faces oozing blood, just wondering just why you were assigned to search that area? But in the end it's always worth it.worth it.	2002-01-06

The majority of the writers have not read or simply do not have the cerebral quotient to conceive the thesis of the book. First lets delineate what this book is NOT about:<br />It is NOT about trying to disprove Evolution.<br />It is NOT about a lawyer trying to prove he knows more about science than true scientist do.<br />It is NOT a treatise on Intelligent Design.<br />But this is how the book has been characterized by many of the negative reviewers before me.<br />SO WHAT IS THIS BOOK ABOUT?<br />This book is about two different philosophical worldviews and how these two worldviews impact science and scientific theories. It delineates between the two opposing philosophies at hand. The book shows clearly how science and scientist are forced to accept dogmatically the philosophy of naturalism or be spurned from the scientific community.<br />The sad part of naturalistic belief system is that it precludes the scientist from using all of the available empirical and verifiable data as his or her disposal. It insists that they sit in a box and are only allowed to view the items in their naturalistic box. Anything that falls outside the box, even if they know it is true and has been proven to be true has to be at best ignored or at worst falsified into a non-eventuality. The bottom line is that the naturalistic scientist cannot use all the evidence at his disposal so his theories or constructs are at best weak due to the inability to view the panoply of events around him. The most curious item about naturalistic scientist is their insistence that their philosophical presuppositions make them unbiased. When in reality they are being controlled by materialistic ideals and not allowed to venture out of there box.<br />This in a nutshell is what this book is about, would you prefer a teacher who is teaching you child how to write to be constrained by a philosophy that the only letters in the alphabet are A-L and anything after L just doesn't exist. Or would you rather have a teacher that says balderdash; We have 26 letters and they are A-Z.<br />Mr. Johnson is an A-Z person. What are you?<br />A-L?<br />OR<br />A-Z?thing after L just doesn't exist.

He looked Middle Eastern. Hmmm, nope no terrorist acts would ever occur on American soil right. Then the second little facts that weren't put to light, the bomb making materials that they had receipts for would never have been enough to do that sort of damage. And on it goes.<br />The interesting thing is that Stephen Jones (the author and McVeighs attorney) even points the finger at Osama Bin Laden back in 1998. Hello is anybody listening. Hindsight is great, but I think we all knew there was more than meets the eye about this ordeal.<br />The weakest part of the book is that MR. Jones never delves deep enough into why the government cover-up. He barely scratches the surface, but I think that is the real mystery. Why was the government not screaming that we know there was at least one other person involved and we need to find him? Is it simply that Bill Clinton didn't want to rock the boat? Could it have been that he was trying to create a legacy for himself, other than ????gate (you fill in the scandal)? Did he think naming an Arab as a suspect might destroy peace talks with Israel and Palestine? These are all only conjectures but the book should have hit these issues harder.<br />Overall a good book, especially for the ignorant Americans who are spoon-fed their daily dose of propaganda from CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, Etc., and think its news.	2002-01-03

What Mark Skousen does in this book is absolutely astounding, at least for an economist. He seems to be out in the real world, seeing just what effects the newest policy has on businesses and people. He first of all destroys the myth that the GNP is an accurate number and shows what should be done to reflect a more accurate measurement of the economy. He also brings back the Gold Standard and idea that will have to be put into place especially now that we have the Euro Dollar.<br />I highly suggest this book to anyone who has an interest in basic economics. This book should be required reading for all high school students, because if they read this text and understand it America will grow to be a very strong financial secure nation.<br />Good Job Mr. Skousen<br />One suggestion: A good book that could complement this one is to read \\"The Seven Fat Years: and how to do it again\\" BY: Robert L.

But rather than just heaps of praise upon Reagan's policy he goes and does the next step. He shows without a doubt that what truly works in creating real and lasting prosperity. He takes the theory of supply side economics, what the leftist news media slammed and never reported on in a fair and intelligent matter, and makes it highly accessible to any layperson. If you are not a convert after living though the 80's and you are still not a convert after reading this text you a hopelessly incurable socialist.<br />I would suggest that you also read another book \\"Economics on Trial: Lies, Myths and Realities\\" By Mark Skousen.

You also have to wonder why the publisher allowed this drivel to be printed. The author is a good writer, however this book is nothing more than a op-ed piece explaining the authors belief on 5 Moral Issues<br /><br />1. Abortion 2. Suicide 3. Euthanasia 4. Capital Punishment 5. Racial Justice and Affirmative Action<br /><br />If you would like to know what he said on each issue just take the left-wing position on each and you have his thoughts.<br /><br />While his positions on each issue is predictable the tedious part about the book is his argumentation for why he believes the way he does. Absolutely no new ground is covered and most of his arguments are simply rehashes of arguments that have been put forward 5 years before this book was published. If he would have refined the arguments or at least taken out some of the errors of the earlier arguments the book would have been better.<br /><br />Not to bore the reader of this review I will give but one example of completely erroneous concepts that are brought forward as truth in this book. On pg. 25 in the Abortion chapter the author quotes Cell biologist Charles Gardner as follows:<br /><br />\\"There is no program to specify the fate of each cell,\\" notes Gardner. \\"Each stage brings new information, information that will change as the body pattern changes.\\" One single cell may contribute randomly to the formation of several different body parts. \\"With this layering of chance event upon chance event the embryo gradually evolves its form.\\" Not only is the person that the embryo is to become not programmed in the fertilized egg, not even so much as a fingerprint is already there. The ovum is in no way, argues Gardner, \\"a pre-packaged human being\\"<br /><br />OH REALLY<br /><br />Come on now with the advances in the understanding of the human genome and of the possibility of cloning in the near future. I don't know of any competent scientist that will tell you that the human DNA is NOT an architectural map of that person.

I guess I had built it up after reading many of the good reviews it has received. I will not be overly verbose in my critique because if you go back and read some of the other reviews that had a dim outlook on this book you will find some well reasoned critiques. What does seems self-evident after reading this book is that Mr. Shermer is so philosophically attached to his constructs and his world-view, he believes that everything else is weird. His viewpoints are so ingrained that he is no longer a skeptic but he has become an obscurantist!<br />There is a fairly good chapter in the book (that's why I gave it two stars), it is Chapter 3 &#34;How Thinking Goes Wrong: Twenty-five Fallacies That Lead Us to Believe Weird Things&#34;. While Mr. Shermer's outline in this chapter is fairly correct it is interesting to note that he then goes and breaks at least 6 of his 25 fallacies during arguments in his book. So if you believe that his 25 fallacies are correct you must find that some of his argumentation is in error. In that case Mr. Shermer makes fallacious statements in his book and therefore, his conclusions are false. Hmmm, the old two-edged sword strikes again.<br />But let's get back to Chapter 3 and the 25 fallacies. Probably the most enlightening fallacy pointed out by our author (I believe that he thinks it is the most important also because he lists it first) is &#34;Theory Influence Observations&#34;. Here is a quick quote from the book that delineates the authors understanding of this: &#34;The theory in part CONSTRUCTS the reality. Reality exists independent of the observer, of course, but our perceptions of reality are influenced by the theories framing our examination of it.&#34; (Emphasis in original p46)<br />This quote is quite correct for those who have an ideological agenda attached to their own theories. For example if a certain person thinks that belief in Chocolate is weird, that person would be able to find enough facts to support their own illogical construct. They then could write a book called &#34;Why People Believe in the Weird Thing Known as Chocolate&#34;. I think you get my point.<br />Some of the biggest errors in the book, probably at least 35% of the book, relate directly to the &#34;Theory Influence Observation&#34; error. For Michael Shermer tacitly admits to his belief in the philosophical constructs of Naturalism. He is therefore, bound by the constraints of naturalistic thought. For it is Mr. Shermer, who has painted himself into this philosophical box. The gigantic hurdle then becomes for people who read this book to see that it is in reality a tome of enlightenment to the deity of Naturalism. While the author derides anyone who disagrees with him as being unscientific and unenlightened, it is the sad fact that it is Mr. Shermer who has a set of ideological rules laid out that he must play by. For if in the quest of truth Mr. Shermer comes upon empirical facts and evidence in opposition to his belief system, he must, according to naturalistic presupposition disregard the truth in favor of the philosophy.<br />It is absolutely amazing that these people who say they are open-minded skeptics are in reality bound by a set of rules so stringent that they cannot accept verifiable evidence to the contrary. I feel sorry for the ilk who are so easily swayed by this drivel.<br />Moreover I have suggestion for more appropriate titles for this work would be:<br />&#34;Your Weird if you don't believe in the things that I do&#34;<br />&#34;Convert to my Belief Structure or you will be labeled a Weirdo&#34;<br />&#34;I'm Right and Your Wrong&#34;<br />&#34;You too can be a skeptic as long as you believe in the same things I do&#34;<br />&#34;Freethought Thinking 101: Just believe everything I tell you and your too can be a freethought prodigy&#34;<br />&#34;Naturalist We're right Naturally&#34;ble to find enough facts to support their own illogical construct.

For if in the quest of truth Mr. Shermer comes upon empirical facts and evidence in opposition to his belief system, he must, according to naturalistic presupposition disregard the truth in favor of the philosophy.<br />It is absolutely amazing that these people who say they are open-minded skeptics are in reality bound by a set of rules so stringent that they cannot accept verifiable evidence to the contrary. I feel sorry for the ilk who are so easily swayed by this drivel.<br />Moreover I have suggestion for more appropriate titles for this work would be:<br />&#34;Your Weird if you don't believe in the things that I do&#34;<br />&#34;Convert to my Belief Structure or you will be labeled a Weirdo&#34;<br />&#34;I'm Right and Your Wrong&#34;<br />&#34;You too can be a skeptic as long as you believe in the same things I do&#34;<br />&#34;Freethought Thinking 101: Just believe everything I tell you and your too can be a freethought prodigy&#34;<br />&#34;Naturalist We're right Naturally&#34;	2002-01-02

While this fantasy may entertain the fringe radical leftist and cause them to offer all sorts of accolades to the author, it does nothing to advance a moderate view of the events that transpired. There are several points that I wish to make about this book.<br /><br />First, Mr. Bugliosi claims that he is moderate (17), you can also dispel this myth by reading his book No Island of Sanity Paula Jones V Bill (sic) Clinton. However, one can facilely tell of his hatred of any person that stands to the right of Bill Clinton. The pejoratives that he copiously doles out, go to show the childishness of the author. A few examples are as follows: \\"Rabid right wing\\" (16), \\"mental midgets\\" (16), \\"the thin-lipped, chinless people with beady eyes of no particular color who wear their patriotism on their sleeves\\"(18), \\"human mutants\\" (37), and then hypocrisy at its finest \\"the far right unquestionably is much more mean-spirited\\"(20). You can't really blame Bugliosi though, when you have little if any facts to back up a far-fetched claim it is better to attack the personage involved rather than the problem. Besides his hate-filled writing always scores points with those on the left.<br /><br />The second problem I find about this book is the idea that facts do not matter only what Mr. Bugliosi says matters but even then he has a unique way of contradicting himself. He makes broad statements as certainty with no factual support from them such as \\"we know more Floridians intended to vote for Al Gore than for Bush\\" (15).He then backpedals slightly from \\"we know\\" to \\"estimate\\" (36) all to try to prove a point that voter intent in Palm Beach should be looked at and Al Gore should be granted 22,235 more votes due to voter confusion on the ballot (36). However in a moment of clear and lucid thought the author even admits the obvious and contradicts his previous conclusions, \\"I'm not suggesting that erroneous votes for Buchanan should have been changed to a vote for Gore\\" (37). But Mr. Bugliosi, your whole book is based on the inaccurate presupposition that Al Gore DID get more votes than George W. Bush. You make the argument that the only way he got those votes was to examine each and every ballot, with what I surmise would have to be tarot cards and tea leaves in hand to try to divine whom the citizen really voted for. What you have done is admitted to the prima facie evidence that Al Gore should NOT be awarded votes that are not clear, which by the way is EXACTLY what the 7-2 Supreme Court ruling that you attempt to debase says. If you follow your own logic you will see that George W. Bush won the state of Florida through FOUR official recounts (not to mention the liberal leaning media's recount that handed George W. the election also). HOW THEN COULD THE SUPREME COURT STEAL THE ELECTION THAT EVEN YOU ADMIT TACITLY, BELONGS TO GEORGE W. BUSH?<br /><br />The third problem and the one that vexes me the most is the authors lies about the supreme court decision. Throughout the book he constantly refers to the five justices that gave Bush his victory. It starts on the front cover with five pictures of the Supreme Court justices. And continues throughout the book on virtually every page and ends on the back cover by slamming these five individuals as being \\"knowing surrogate(s) for the Republican Party.\\" He even discuses that all five individuals are right wing puppets and all of their affiliations with the right wing. However this goes plainly against the facts, even the liberal leaning national news weekly's portray the current court as moderate (except of course when they don't get a verdict they like). The latest chart I have shows the courts makeup being 4 liberals 3 conservatives and one moderate leaning to the left and one moderate leaning to the right. But that is beyond the point. The main point is this:<br /><br />THE SUPREME COURT VOTED 7-2!!<br /><br />Mr. Bugliosi in a brazen and mendacious way tries to rewrite history in this book by labeling it a 5-4 ruling. I quote his Amplification Fifteen \\"Many conservatives have referred to the Supreme Court decision as 7-2, not 5-4 decision, because Justices Souter and Breyer also found problems with lack of a uniform standard. But this is hogwash. The decision was 5-4.\\" (109)<br /><br />I will now lay out those pesky little things called facts that really drive liberal revisionists up the wall. This is a verbatim quote from the majority opinion of the United States Supreme Court:<br /><br />\\"SEVEN justices of the court agree that there are constitutional problems with the recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court that demand a remedy\\"<br /><br />The liberals will try to get you to believe that because there were four dissenting opinions it was obviously 5-4. But read the above sentence again. The only disagreement was to remedy, in other words how to fix the problem. Liberal Justices Souter and Breyer much to their credit realized that the sham recounts going on in Florida were a disgrace to our country. What is even more amazing is that Justice Breyer was a Clinton appointee and a personal friend of Al Gore. These two men took their oath seriously and put politics aside and ruled for our Country and for our Constitution.<br /><br />No amount of revisionist thinking can do away with the facts the Supreme Court justices all SEVEN of them ruled correctly and impartially. This book is chock full of sour grapes and goes to show the liberal mantra of the end justifies the means.nt is this:<br /><br />THE SUPREME COURT VOTED 7-2!!<br /><br />Mr. Bugliosi in a brazen and mendacious way tries to rewrite history in this book by labeling it a 5-4 ruling.

I thought it was going to be a right wing slam on the ACLU. I despise books that heap invectives and use ad homieum attacks to disparage the opponents. I enjoy books that paint fair and accurate pictures of ones ideological adversary while using logic and reason to dispute their stands on issues. This book was more than fair to the ACLU and the logic used in it is very impressive.<br />Smith spoke openly and candidly of the good, yes, the GOOD that the ACLU had done. Yet he also pierces the organizations veil like high a powered laser showing how from a idealistic liberty pursing start the ACLU has slid to be a schizophrenic puppet of the ultra liberal left.<br />Just when you begin to feel you are vindicated for holding the ACLU in utter contempt he than turns his laser beam focus on the right and shows you more than enough similarities between the religious right and the radical left to make you squirm. This book does something that so few books do today. It makes you think, not so much about how rotten or evil the ACLU is rather it makes you look introspectively into yourself, your inner psyche and how you may be more like your supposed nemesis than you wish to imagine.<br />ACLU The Devils Advocate FAIR ACCURATE and PENETRATING to your core<br />Kudos F.

US	50819380	R1BB4N76A1P8ZR	039331524X	923776388	The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness	Books	1	46	58	N	Y	Historical Revisionism	This is a difficult book to write a review about simply because one does not know where to start. The book was authored by two Cornell University professors and comes off as a scholarly critique, however upon closer examination you realize that it is nothing but a façade for factual errors. The lack of footnotes and the use of out of context quotes is farcical coming from two professors. They use many one or two word quotes such as these \\"discrimination\\" (38) \\"oppressive measure\\" (68) \\"infernal infamy\\" (103) \\"left wing\\" (112) \\"spiritual church\\" (122) and on it goes. Just what are you supposed to gain from the fact that the founders might have penned \\"oppressive measure\\". Another hurdle in reviewing this book is where do you start with all the inaccuracies. It is easy to point out factual errors but the authors of this book have done something ingenious in their writings. They have mixed factual inaccuracies with their editorial opinions giving the appearance to the reader that even the founding fathers agreed with THEIR thesis. So in reality all they have done is peppered their opinions with the 2 worded quotes attributed to the founding fathers, somehow conveying historicity to their opinions. While it does not take a genius to figure this out, all you need to do is read a few other reviews to find out just how many people were so easily brainwashed by this book.<br /><br />The book is also replete with ad homein attacks, arguments from silence and strawmen attacks. I personally did not expect this from two highly regarded professors and I think it shows some childishness. It would be easy to rip apart the factuality of the book if one had more space instead, I will just focus on their Chapter 4 where we are introduced to John Locke. The authors opine that \\"all important figures of the founding generation. . . . were disciples of Locke.\\" (72) and \\"Locke's convictions form in fact the foundation of the American political creed\\" (72) and \\"The Declaration of Independence reads like a paraphrase of Locke\\" (72). The authors further on in this chapter portray Locke as a atheist who believes \\"the church thus had no special or central place in the secular politics of the founders' liberalism\\" (77). And on it goes, but who is John Locke? Was he as prominent an author as portrayed? Moreover, was he anti-religion?<br /><br />First of all John Locke was born in 1632 and graduated Christ Church College with a masters degree in 1658. He wrote several books including Two Treatises of Government (1690), The Reasonableness of Christianity (1695) and A Vindication of the Reasonableness of Christianity (1697). It was these last two books that decimates the authors opinions that John Locke was not religious, in fact he was a Christian Apologist. However, it was his writing on Treatises of Government that the founding fathers drew the theory of social compact. It was also through these writings that they gained the insight of civil law being grounded in Natural Law. And Natural Law according to Locke is simply Divine (God Inspired) Law whose moral principals can be inferred by anyone. Because John Locke relied so heavily on the bible in developing his political theories it is not surprising to find that he cited the bible a total of 1,514 different times in his Two Treatises of Government; a small fact that the authors of this book omitted. Accordingly, if one were to give an example of Lockean thinking probably the quote \\"We are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. . . \\" would be the best example.<br /><br />The last point about John Locke is just how important was he? The Authors contend he was the most important author to the founding fathers but all we have to do is look at who was cited the most in the founding fathers writing. From 1760 - 1805 just who did the founding father quote the most?<br /><br />#1 THE BIBLE 34% of all quotes<br /><br />#2 Baron Charles Secondat de Montesquieu 8.3%<br /><br />#3 Sir William Blackstone 7.9%<br /><br />#4 John Locke 2.9%<br /><br />As you can see there was some disingenuous on the part of the authors to portray Mr. Locke as the most important scholar of the day. This simple critique of one chapter in the book shows you the inaccuracies that are portrayed repeatedly throughout the book. The bigger question is why do it? Are these two professors trying to pull the wool over everyone eyes for a reason, or have they themselves been brainwashed? By examining their sources that they used for their book we note something interesting. They have listed 27 books and not one of them was an original source document. The authors have culled all their information from current thinking, just look at this breakdown of when the books the authors cited were published:<br /><br />1999 - 1990 8 cites<br /><br />1989 - 1980 7 cites<br /><br />1979 - 1970 4 cites<br /><br />1969 - 1960 6 cites<br /><br />1959 - 1955 2 cites<br /><br />The sad fact is this book is a compilation of modern day scholarship discussing what happened 200+ years ago. Not one original source document was cited so just how could the authors understand what the original intent of the founding fathers were without going back to original sources is beyond comprehension of any historian.<br /><br />This book should be avoided at all costs, go to your library and check out some books written by the founding father or by their contemporaries if you want a accurate picture of the history of this great country.tone 7.9%<br /><br />#4 John Locke 2.9%<br /><br />As you can see there was some disingenuous on the part of the authors to portray Mr. Locke as the most important scholar of the day.

I give it two stars only because I can give this book to people who do not really understand what the left is all about, on to the review.<br /><br />In the introduction Singer is forthright in telling of his idealist \\"egalitarian society to which the left should aspire\\" Of course this is obtained as Singer puts it by \\"urging us to work towards a more equal distribution of resources\\" [9]. And \\"This strongly suggests a need to do something about the economic trends in developed nations which for the past decade or more have increased economic inequality. The left, of course has ample reason to reverse these trends and to make people at the bottom better off.\\" [52] And even clearer \\"A tax on spending - payable through our tax returns rather than as part of the price we pay when we buy - would have a significant positive impact in changing habits. ... this idea, and others in the same arena, are ripe for further investigation.\\" [59] Of course what Singer is talking about is redistribution of wealth. This repressive, regressive tax structure doesn't surprise me, what does is when he equates people who are the most productive and industrious members of our society; and are justly rewarded for their efforts, as \\"LUCKY enough to among the rich\\" [46]. What would Darwin think about these skillful entrepreneurs and businesspeople? Would he attribute their hard work, talent, ingenuity, time, brainpower and toil as luck? Mr. Singer I doubt that very much and for you to suggest this is an affront to every thinking person who has read your book.<br /><br />As we move to chapter 1 Singer makes a glaring mistake in confusing a conservative with a capitalist [10-12]. Capitalism is an economic system while conservatism is a political belief. Capitalism knows no political ideology, it's only interest is in economic outcome. Next we arrive at this quote \\"While the core of the left is a set of values, there is also a penumbra of factual beliefs that have typically been associated with the left.\\"[18] I would have to ask Singer to quantify and qualify the set of values he is talking about. Is he speaking as wanting to be part of the oligarchy of the left or of the massive proletariat of the left? If singer espouses the values of the oligarchy than this whole book is a hypocritical façade and no further comment is needed as we toss it in the trash. However, if he indeed aspires to be with the masses than what values are there. The left's hold on the common people is the fact that they encourage a system of relativistic values that are in fact a pseudo-system of values. The left has aspired to and cloaked itself with the aphorism of moral relativism, in essence it has recreated itself as pliant, amorphous front. This is where its great appeal lies, in its chameleon like quality of showing care and concern to totally dissimilar groups that in many instances are in conflict with each other. To say that it espouses a set of concrete values completely decimates what the left is all about. Why would Singer even pen such ludicrous lines is beyond comprehension, unless of course he envisions himself in the oligarchy.<br /><br />Let's move onto the core of his book and the importance it has to the left. \\"Belief in the malleability of human nature has been important for the left because it has provided grounds for hoping that a very different kind of human society is possible.\\"[24] This is the driving thought of the oligarchy of the left. How do we turn people into a malleable workforce doing whatever the state wants them to do? Of course Singer has the obvious answer, it is to inculcate the masses through our public education system \\" The remaining great barrier to the acceptance of Darwinian thinking by the left is the idea of the malleability of human nature . . . . From this it follows that education in the broadest possible sense is the great panacea, with the potential to mould human beings into perfect citizens.\\" [32-33] WOW, how much clearer can it be. The state through education will mandate you what to think, say and believe.<br /><br />In an attempt to show how cooperative pursuits can help people, Singer than chooses the ignoble example of two prisoners who are in jail.[47-50] They are both given a chance to implicate the other one in a crime and if one does he will walk out free. Singer spends 4 pages out of a 63-page book discussing how they should work together (altruism) and it will be better for them. Not once does the matter of truth (who really committed the crime) come into question, or justice (should the perpetrator be punished) or fairness (why should an innocent man have to spend time in jail if a guilty prisoner frames him). Once again facts and moral questions are simply swept under the rug. But of course trying to deal with the essential concept of truth is the ultimate and insuperable Pandora's box of the left.<br /><br />In Chapter 4 \\"From Cooperation (read subjugation) to Altruism\\" Singer ask the question \\"Is it really impossible for the left to seek to promote a society in which there is a strong feeling of concern for the good of others\\". Of course Singer has the answer, he has already revealed that the state has control by indoctrination through the education system. Next we take our dumbed-down workers and study them because the state \\"need(s) to understand more about what it is that leads people to donate blood or bone marrow, so that we can base social policies on a more secure foundation of knowledge about human behaviour.\\" [58] SOCIAL POLICIES: Hitler had social policies, Stalin had social policies, Pol Pot had social policies, etc etc etc ad-nauseam. Wake up people can't you smell the primordial stew bubbling?.

I found this book to be very enjoyable, the prose was fast paced and it was written for the layperson to easily digest. It begins by defining chance and then showing what some of the preeminent scientists of the last few centuries had to say about it. Mr. Sproul is not trying to give a  lesson in the historicity of any particular theorem he is however, trying  to show that great minds have divided over these issues at hand. The books  downfall, if you can call it that, was to attack quantum mechanics (QM)  using logic to show that it is not a complete theory. QM adherents  especially those who are philosophically attached to quantum chaos (QC)  (SOAPBOX: It is a dangerous position for any `non-biased' scientist is to  be philosophically or ideologically attached to any theory) have  presupposed themselves to a chance (deterministic) driven cosmos.<br />At  first I felt that this book could have benefited by showing the other  scientific theories that show an indeterministic universe, but that is not  Mr. Sproul's arena. He is a theologian and makes no pretense about it, his  arguments are clear and cogent let me show you a couple of quotes from the  books should suffice the logistician in any of us.<br />\\"Anomalies represent  present mysteries. They are unsolved problems. An easy solution to mystery  is to give it another name: CHANCE. Voltaire saw CHANCE as a  word-substitute for the unknown, again a cover-up for ignorance. The  problem is one that confuses mystery and contradiction. All contradictions  are mysterious. Not all mysteries are contradictions. To say that the cause  of a known effect is unknown is to say that the cause remains a mystery. To  say that the cause of a known effect is chance is to say that the cause is  a contradiction. It is to say that the effect has no cause, which is a  contradiction of terms.\\" Pg. 28-29<br />\\"There is no greater erroneous  assumption muddying the water of contemporary science then the assumption  that chance has instrumental, causal power. Here contradiction runs wild  under the seemingly harmless cloak of mystery\\". Pg. 31<br />\\"What is basically  happening here is the tacit assertion that we can have effects without  causes.\\" Pg. 48<br />\\"I do not allow for uncaused effects because uncaused  effects represent a contraction in terms. The idea of an \\"uncaused effect\\"  is analytically false. It is a nonsense statement, akin to speaking of  square circles and married bachelors. An \\"effect\\" is by definition  something produced by an antecedent cause. If it has NO CAUSE, it is not an  effect. If it is an EFFECT, then it has a cause.\\" Pg. 49<br />  DUH!<br />I feel that there has been some obfuscation by another  reviewer about QM, specifically about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle  (HUP) and it's relation to chance. HUP does not mitigate for chance or  uncertainty the antipodal is in fact true. For those of you who do not  understand the HUP it is very simple. At present it is not possible to know  with unlimited accuracy both the position (x) and the momentum (p) of a  particle. Why can't I know? Well in order locate a certain particle  exactly, an observer must be able to bounce off it a photon of radiation;  this act of location itself alters the position of the particle. To locate  the position accurately, photons of short wavelengths would need to be  used. These photons have a high momenta and would cause a large effect upon  the particles position. It's kind of like a pool-ball effect, you bounce  one photon off a particle it is going to budge it a little bit. So there is  uncertainty associated with each measurement that you can never get rid of  you experiments.<br />But please note and this is the important point that  many seem to misunderstand. The HUP does not say, \\"everything is  uncertain.\\" Rather, it tells us very exactly where the limits of  uncertainty lie when we make measurements of sub-atomic events. This is not  chance; this is EFFECT. Whenever I make a measurement, I MUST disturb the  system, I am the CAUSE. The uncertainty then of the effect that I have  caused lies in our ability or rather our inability to measure a particle  without disturbing it. The logic that says because we at this time cannot  measure a particles x and p accurately while also predicting how the  particle will react to our measurement stimulus must therefore show that  because we don't know something (mystery) is it is therefore acting in a  undeterministic (chance) fashion is farcical. Since when in the scientific  world has a paucity of data about a known event been shown to PROVE that  the event in question didn't have precedent verifiable cause? NEVER.<br />One  last point, anybody interested in understanding how cause is the  deterministic factor in science should learn about chaos mathematics, and  also look into the superstring theories. Just search them out on the web  and you will probably drop the deterministic philosophies that crept into  the noble field of science.<br />Kudos Mr. Sproul, for a non-scientist you did  an excellent job.FECT.

First a few remarks on the below critiques of Mr. Lerner's book. Come on people please stop the invectives and hyperbole. Science should be a pursuit of the truth and any opposing hypothesis or argument should be  greatly appreciated by the adherents to that specific viewpoint. Opposing  views show weaknesses AND strengths in one's theory. I welcome this book it  raises some very good questions and shows some of the deficiencies in the  current big bang model that need to be addressed.<br />However, I have a  different take on why this conjecture came about. I do not know Mr. Lerner  personally, but we do have some mutual colleagues, some that support the  plasma cosmology and others that do not. What is interesting is their  reasons for this support seem not to come from a purely scientific zeal but  rather a fear of the ontological implications of the current big bang  theory. While physicists have usually been inoculated from the mind numbing  and intellect robbing philosophy of naturalism that pervades most of the  other scientific fields of study, I believe that this postulate was a  direct concoction to adhere to presuppositions of naturalism. To back up  this point one only needs to read Chapter Nine \\"Infinite in Time and Space\\"  specifically the subsections labeled \\"Cosmology and Theology\\", Infinity and  Deity\\", and \\"The Moment of Creation\\".<br />A scientist should bring no  philosophical presuppositions to the table, when we do we tend to overlook  or bypass data that disagrees with what we want to find. The big bang model  as it is now, is incomplete, there are still many questions that need to be  answered. However the majority of empirical and verifiable data still  points towards a cataclysmic start of the universe from vacuity. This book  did not show that the big bang is unattainable due to the paucity of the  data, rather it shows that there are many unknowns and further work must be  done. Just as there are many undiscovered properties about light, gravity,  etc. et al.<br />If you read this book just to bolster you belief that the big  bang could not have happened, I suggest that you sincerely look at why you  hold that belief. What scares you about the big bang model? If you want it  to bolster your philosophical stance against the unknown, buy it. If  however, you hold to the big bang model as cosmological fact, buy this book  also, it will challenge you and enlighten you to see that we don't have all  the answer's yet.gravity,  etc. et al.<br />If you read this book just to bolster you belief that the big  bang could not have happened, I suggest that you sincerely look at why you  hold that belief.
