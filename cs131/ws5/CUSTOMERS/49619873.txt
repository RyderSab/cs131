Genius SF writer Rudy Rucker's new book is fantastic, and just in time, too! He writes, among other things, that we are<br /><br />presently in the midst of a third global intellectual revolution. The<br /><br />first came with Isaac Newton: the planets obey physical laws. The second<br /><br />came with Charles Darwin: biology obeys genetic laws. In today's third<br /><br />revolution, says Rucker, we are coming to realize that even minds and societies<br /><br />emerge from interacting laws that can be regarded as computations.<br /><br />Everything is a computation. Cool!<br /><br />Does this, then, mean that the world is dull? Far from it. The<br /><br />naturally-occurring computations that surround us are richly complex.<br /><br />For example, a tree's growth, the changes in the weather, the flow of daily news, a<br /><br />person's ever-changing moods --- all of these computations share the<br /><br />crucial property of being gnarly. Although lawlike and deterministic,<br /><br />gnarly computations are --- and this is a key point --- inherently<br /><br />unpredictable. The world's mystery is preserved.<br /><br />Mixing together anecdotes, graphics, and fables, Rucker teases out the<br /><br />implications of his new worldview, which he calls \\"universal<br /><br />automatism.\\" His analysis reveals startling aspects of the everyday<br /><br />world, touching upon such topics as chaos, the Internet, fame, free<br /><br />will, and the pursuit of happiness. More than a popular science book,<br /><br />this book is a philosophical<br /><br />entertainment that teaches us how to enjoy our daily lives to the<br /><br />fullest possible extent.	2005-09-20

My father passed away at the age of 90, I was 56, and at the time of his passing, I was halfway around the world, in another country, more than 8000 miles away! Due to my work and travels, and the sudden-ness of my father's death, I could not make it back home to be with him. However, we knew he was in failing health for the last year or so, so I was ready for this to happen, well, as much as one can ever be ready for the death of a parent!<br /><br />What is strange is that about four days before he took his last breath, in a quiet and peacefull sleep of death before he passed to the other side, I suddenly became very very ill, in my hotel room, felt like I was dying, felt like all the energy in my body was being drained away, and I had no idea why, at the time. I could not sleep all night, woke up in a sweat, had zero energy and felt like I was doing to die that very day. I was so scared I visited a doctor and had some blood tests done, because I was sure I was going to die of something weird. But no, I was okay the next day, it was just a 24 hour flu bug or something, the doctor told me after telling my blood tests didn't reveal anything abnormal except a high white blood cell count. But I didn't have a fever, I didn't have the runs, it didn't seem like the flu bug.<br /><br />Then, four days later, I received the sad phone call: Dad has passed away. I wonder if somehow he was trying to contact me, halfway around the world, via ESP, that somehow his draining energy was making contact with my energy, which also felt so draining, and that this was his way of saying goodbye to me, after all these years of a good father and son bond. I still wonder about this, and am usually a skeptic when it comes to matters like this. I don't believe in God or any gods, and I don't really believe in ESP. And yet, this happened to me, and now I feel I want to find out more about what really happened. I feel that this book was a good place to start.rt.	2005-08-23

A popular university professor at Chinese Culture University in Taipei, an anthropologist and a practicing poet, Morris Wu embarked on a trilogy of novels about expat life in Taiwan a few years ago, and she has just published the final installment, titled \\"A Conspiracy of Nations\\".<br /><br />Like the two earlier books \\"Losing Plum Blossom\\" and \\"The Black King,\\" the third book delivers the goods, with graceful writing, a gripping plot and a cast of characters that readers will care about.<br /><br />\\"A Conspiracy of Nations\\" is 452 pages long, and it's a real page-turner from the get-go. The cover art sets the stage for what is a very accomplished novel by a local writer who is now a veteran novelist.<br /><br />Morris Wu's earlier novels in the series were described by local reviewers as Taiwanese versions of \\"Sex and the City\\" or \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" and this last installment continues the sexual politics on a global scale.<br /><br />There's Clarissa, an American widow who, following the death of her husband in Vietnam, married a Taiwanese orthopedic surgeon. But that marriage was never a sexual match because her then-husband, Ahmed, was gay and had a lover who worked alongside him in a local Taipei hospital he practiced in.<br /><br />Now, in the third novel in the trilogy, Clarissa and Ahmed are divorced, and this woman of the world -- a poet to boot -- has new dreams and new loves.<br /><br />With a literary dash of Dame Barbara Cartland, the queen of British romantic fiction, and some James Bond-like international adventures thrown in for good measure, Morris Wu has written a fabulous finale to her 1500-page trilogy, and readers will be duly rewarded.<br /><br />There are local settings inTaiwan, of course, romantic overseas adventures in Hungary, where Clarissa attends a global poetry conference to read her own work to a gathering of world poets.<br /><br />Many of the characters from the first two novels of the series reappear here, so it's easy to dig right in and back get into the swing of things.<br /><br />After a series of thrilling adventures in Bangkok and eastern Europe, Clarissa resumes her love affair with Ahmed in the picturesque lake district of rural Hungary, while all around them, political intrigue swirls and boils over into a plot structure that never loses its tension and romance.<br /><br />So is it over, the Morris Wu trilogy?<br /><br />\\"No, it's not over,\\" her lovingly-created character Clarissa tells ex-husband Ahmed in a heart-breaking conclusion on the final page. \\"You have a world to make right, dear. I will be rooting for you ... for signs that you have been victorious, that you have succeeded in mending the international relationships of Japan and the UnitedStates, saving Taiwan and giving it a destiny that it can call its own.\\"<br /><br />Morris Wu is working now on a new novel, with some of the characters from her trilogy in the cast, and whether it will be part of a new series or a fourth part of what will become her ''Asian quartet'' remains to be seen.<br /><br />At the moment, \\"A Conspiracy of Nations\\" -- a wonderful title, by the way -- puts the final touches on a hard-working Taiwan-based novelist's song of life!

Tristan Egolf, a very French pen name, maybe, is dead. Suicide at age 33. But: There might be a bit of PR hype going on here.

But it all began<br /><br />on a cold and rainy November day in Paris when Marie Modiano by pure<br /><br />chance saw Tristan playing his guitar on the street and invited him<br /><br />home for coffee. Now does anyone really believe this PR hype that<br /><br />might have even contributed in some way to the writer's early death ?<br /><br />Why ?

The actor friend is at the very least honest about<br /><br />his simplicity, and admirable in being unpretentious.<br /><br />A terribly- theme book<br /><br />that tricked the critics. And Hollywood got really scammed on this one.<br /><br />When America is gone and buried, in another 10,0o0 years, this book and movie will signify what went wrong, way back when.<br /><br />Good writing, bad theme.

Dial has been captured, with the warden's wife, too. Dial, a sculptor and painter, was convicted of the 1981 murder of a karate instructor. He had obtained trusty status at the Oklahoma State Reformatory, and he ran an inmate pottery program with Bobbi Parker and had access to the couple's home during the day in staff housing on prison grounds.<br /><br />Bobbi Parker's mother received a phone call from her the night of the 1994 disappearance traced to Hurst, Texas. \\"I can't talk now,\\" she said, crying. \\"I'm OK. Tell the kids I'll see them soon.\\"<br /><br />A day later, she made a second call, this time from Fort Worth to a friend. It was the last message her family got from her. \\"Tell the kids I love them and I'll be home soon,\\" she said.<br /><br />In a jailhouse interview with reporters Tuesday, Dial, 60, said he took Parker at knifepoint when he escaped.<br /><br />\\"I was a hostage-taker and will probably live to regret it,\\" Dial said. \\"But now I don't. Doing a life sentence, at my age, I wouldn't trade it for the past 10 1/2 years.\\"<br /><br />Dial said their relationship was never romantic and that they lived in separate rooms. He likened Parker's relationship to him as \\"Stockholm Syndrome,\\" where kidnapping victims become sympathetic to their captors over time, often out of fear of violence.<br /><br />\\"She was living under the impression if she ever tried to get away, I would get away and I would make her regret it, particularly toward her family,\\" Dial said. \\"I didn't mean it, but she didn't know that.\\"<br /><br />What an amazing story this is now!

The Mormon missionaries who populate the countryside are just like Vincent in this book, facing similar problems of love, lust and faith. This book will make a great Hollywood movie starring Leonardo di Caprio or someone; it's a very engaging and vivid book.<br /><br />However, one quibble. The cover of the book, and all the reviews here and elsewhere, make it look like this is a book about China. It is not about China. It is about Taiwan. Taiwan is a separate country from China, just like America is a separate country from the UK. But the cover and much of the critical reviews, and even the author himself, speak of Chinese culture and China as if this was part of Taiwan. They are not. Taiwan has its own culture, its own way of thinking, and it has nothing to do with China anymore. So I wish the cover showed a train rolling along the plains of western Taiwan, where Toulio is situated (I lived there once, too) instead of showing the sterotypical \\"China image\\" of those mysterious mountains in the background. China is China, and Taiwan is Taiwan; and this book is about Taiwan, not China. It is a very important distinction that I wish the author had paid more attention to.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great novel. Will make a great movie someday!	2005-03-04

Now Eurasian Press has published a Chinese-language edition for the Taiwan market, giving earlier publishing credit to the Japanese firm and not to Doubleday. Maybe Doubleday sold the rights to Japan and there was no need to credit the Canadian firm.

Witty, charming, funny, comic, insightful, biting, ironic,sarcastic, philosophical ... this is a travel writer worth waiting for. If you read one good book this summer, read this one.

Without a doubt, Klein's take on Elvis Presely is going to go down in US literary history as one of the most creative and dynamic treatments of the musical icon. The first two books were fantastic, and this third book goes even further in giving the reader a new way to look at the King. As soon as the New York Times and People magazine weigh in with their judgments, Klein's series of Elvis yarns will become part of American literaary culture. Viva La Klein! Can't wait for the 4th and 5th installments, too.	2003-03-05

A kind of lie is being generated by the media and the publisher. In fact, Norwegian Wood, which is by far Murakami's best work ever, and a milestone in Japanese literature, was translated into English before and attracted many fans. Me, too. But the publisher decided that releasing WOOD in the early 1990s would not be good for Murakami's career in the US, (read: reviews and sales), because they wanted to develop his image first with his other books. Which they did. But it is not true to say the Haruki didn't authorize a translation before or that there was legal action problems. No, it was a pure marketing move by the editors in Japan and New York, and it was dishonest. Fans have been waiting for years for this book, and it is a real crime to have kept the book back under the pretense of publishing poppycock. That said, let Murakami someday tell the truth in an interview (he will, he will); meanwhile, read the book. It is by far the greatest piece of Japanese literature in the last 50 years and if you really want to understand the Japan that is today Japan, read this book...and weep. Murakami got it right. His publishers should confess to the public and stop this marketing PR spin. Give us a break, Haruki! So, yes, five stars, ten stars, this book will go down in history as Murakami's best!	2000-09-22

WHile the book is indeed a great read, one must question whether author Golden did indeed betray the trust Mineko Iwasaki in Kyoto gave him when she told him her story. Did he betray her? She intends to sue for libel.  This brings up another question: who wrote the book, really?	2000-06-26

Books	5	10	10	N	N	A book for our times...	&quot;What's Wrong With Dorfman?&quot; may just turn out to be L.A. writer John Blumenthal's &quot;breakthrough&quot; book, bringing him the national audience he really deserves. And the title of his novel, What's Wrong With  Dorfman?&quot; (WWWD) may turn out to be the battle cry of the first decade  of this new millennium, bringing to mind other questions such as  &quot;What's wrong with America?&quot; and &quot;What's wrong with  everyone?&quot; Martin Dorfman may go down in literary history as John  Blumenthal's liveliest creation. What's wrong with Martin Dorfman? Plenty.  The book is great!  The novel is a thoughtful, hilarious read, from  beginning to end. If any US satirist deserves to be &quot;discovered&quot;  at this point in time, it's Blumenthal, a veteran Hollywood screenwriter  who knows the ins and outs of Tinseltown, and has honed his craft in the  belly of the beast. The book is a witty, LOL study of Americana, and brings  to mind the works of Nathaniel West. If you are looking for a summer  pick-me-up, Blumenthal's latest book is perfect for the beach, the airplane  or your air-conditioned living room.	2000-06-25
