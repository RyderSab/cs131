We have used this book and the other volumes as the major thrust of our children's education for years.  Diana Waring has successfully produced an invaluable, unparalled resource in the chronological study of history that integrates the Bible into the timeline for what it is - part of HISTORY!!  Her series effectively integrates in the student's mind that Bible and History are not two separate subjects.  This series has resoundingly enabled our students to understand the Biblical worldview and moved them through an understanding of cultural shifts that have led society away from the Biblical model.  She gives numerous examples of data that supports Biblical historical events and that continue to be ignored by agenda-driven evolutionists.  She also cites numerous passages that affirm God's plan and foreknowledge of historical events that were prophesied in Scripture.  This is incredibly validating to our students as they mesh their teaching from church into history class! It is critical to purchase the \\"What in The World's Going On Here?\\" tapes/cd's to have a full understanding of the outline and activities presented in this book.<br /><br />My only criticisms are easily overcome...<br />1.  The target age-level is unclear for this curriculum.  While the accompanying activity book is overly juvenile, most of the recommended books are for Jr. High and beyond.  Many of the readings are appropriate for intellectual adults.  However, the reading age-level for the recommendations are marked and the curriculum is easily suited for multi-level teaching.  The historical outline can be taught to virtually any age level.<br />2.  In my calculations, 19 of the books recommended in Volume I are OOP (Out of Print) books.  It was frustrating because most of them are somewhat difficult to replace, due to their uniquely Christian and Biblically-affirming stance on typically secular approached subjects.<br /><br />Those criticisms aside, Diana Waring's series has more than aptly prepared my children, now adults, to have a substantial global understanding and prepared them for deeper worldview approached apologetics studies in High School.ults, to have a substantial global understanding and prepared them for deeper worldview approached apologetics studies in High School.	2005-10-05

It greatly assisted our kids in integrating history and having a worldview understanding rather than just merely knowing the events of our country. In doing so, we became quickly aware that the resources for teaching world history to younger children were sorely lacking.  This book was an excellent beginner level resource on Knossos, the Mycenaeans, the Dark Ages, Olympics, Sparta, the Persian Wars, Ancient Athens, the Peloponnesian War and Alexander the Great.  I highly recommend it.	2005-10-05

While the accompanying text is generally engaging and valuable, the activity book has been very disappointing from two aspects:<br /><br />First, it is primarily a series of coloring pages.  The maps are slightly useful, but their \\"mapwork\\" typically involves something like taking a yellow crayon to follow the already dotted line. The questions are useful only if the parent is not reading along with the child to guide them in comprehension of the material.<br /><br />More insidiously, the textbook treads dangerously close to being a humanistic primer in \\"The Kid's Guide to Choosing A Religion.\\"  There may indeed be a market for that. Additionally, it is clear that homeschoolers are not limited to fundamentalist Christians.  However, this book is heavily marketed through fundamentalist Christian catalog sources and, to me, that is misleading marketing. The reviewer who requested Christians stay away from commenting about books marketed on this secular website is ill-informed about the marketing thrust of this book and publisher.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that this author has chosen to emphasize political correctness, which is most actively done in the first volume of the Story of the World series.  It seems inconsistent with traditional classical approaches to introduce the more philisophical thought processes in the early elementary grades.  I am NOT a parent who believes that children should not be exposed to other cultures or religions.  On the contrary, as a Christian parent, I think it is critical for our children of appropriate age level to understand the basic tenets of other religions, their often frightening origins, and how they are contrasted by the Biblical worldview.<br /><br />Buy what you choose to buy.  No one is trying to assert that all curriculum is Christian based. Christians should, however,  be aware that this volume treats the introduction of our Lord Jesus Christ in the same way that it introduces Confuscius, Buddha, and other Greek gods.  It does not even attempt to begin the \\"Story of the World\\" with ANY explanation of its origin, let alone giving even the option of understanding Creation.  The story begins with nomadic tribes.  It proceeds through an awkward attempt at melding Abraham, the Story of Gilgamesh, Greek Gods,and Confucius.  Rather than an exhaustive and encompassing world approach to covering history, it has an overemphasis on the religious entities of those cultures and blurs the lines between fact and fiction.<br /><br />My experience with this series has unexpectedly caused a hesistation on my part to purchase ANY material from this author.ur Lord Jesus Christ in the same way that it introduces Confuscius, Buddha, and other Greek gods.

While the church then had staunchly supported preconceived notions regarding astronomy (despite Biblical references that did not concur with those thoughts), Galileo persevered in pursuing truth based on factual observations.

I have had an interest in buying this book for many years.  It is recommended in virtually every reputable catalog.  It just always seemed like when essential schoolbooks were purchased, it didn't make sense to purchase a book about just ONE person.  Well, that was a gigantic mistake on my part.  The accomplishments of Archimedes made him one of the most important founders of science.  This captivating book tells the story of Archimedes life AND gives vivid imagery to his accomplishments through simple, effective text and delightful illustrations.  From my 3rd grader to my 10th grader, they all eagerly finished the book with enthusiastic comprehension.  Of course, the \\"Eureka\\" story stood out to all, but other concepts such as levers and water displacement were covered in a way that brought clarity to those scientific principles.

Virtually all self-destructive behaviors stem from having an incorrect perception of oneself.  Either people do not internally feel a purpose for their life and walk through life with an emptiness of self-hate or they compensate with an over-focus on the importance of themselves in society.  Eventually, as inevitable inadequacies surface, they plummet into rounds of depression and poor choices to numb that awareness.<br /><br />This struggle is only overcome when we see our true status - lost without the Lord, but saved by grace, and transformed into a purpose driven life.  People need a vision for their life.  They need to grasp the sense of a higher calling.  So many \\"self-help\\" books regurgitate a bunch of psychobabble that never culminates in deep and lasting truths.  Warren has successfully integrated popularly appealing techniques to draw in a reader to God's Word.  Many are those who might not pick up a Bible or grace the doors of a church.  We gave the book to someone who was resistant to the Lord, having life problems from poor personal choices, and even hated reading.  To our great joy, the book was so compelling that it was eagerly read and received in the heart.	2005-08-13

This captivating novel relates the dialogue between two demons who have the task of derailing their assigned person from following the Christian walk altogether or, at least, rendering their spiritual walk fruitless and joyless.  It is very disturbing initially to read as they call God the enemy, but it is important to understand the true spiritual battle going on.  Deep insights are coveyed.  For instance, one of the demons relates discouragement that his human is going to church.  The other one responds that often this is the best place for a Christian to dwell that they might be easily lulled into a complacent numbness to their spiritual condition. This is an honest and excellent book that you won't want to put down!	2005-07-30

If they are not, how will they be prepared with a ready answer and be well-educated to culturally important works?<br />ANSWER: Peter Leithart<br /><br />Leithart enters the debate with an excellent resource for the education of Christian young people.  He takes \\"important\\" classical works and examines them by practically contrasting them against the Biblical worldview.  I use the word \\"important\\" as a term meaning that the philosophies in these works dramatically impacted worldview shifts in the course of history.  By contrasting these thoughts to the Biblical truths, Leithart assists in preparing young adults to give a defense for the \\"hope that is within them.\\"<br /><br />Leithart also brings excellent literary information, as well.  He examines literary devices and references other well-known works as part of the study.	2005-07-29

Unless you are a literature professor or certified theologian, do not attempt to read Dante's Divine Comedy without this book!(My understanding is that Leithart happens to be both!)  My teenage daughter and I attempted to work our way through the trilogy without Leithart's excellent guide. Finally, I just set it aside until Leithart's book was published.  What a difference some guidance makes.  Many view the Divine Comedy as merely a theological examination of the \\"places\\" of hell, purgatory, and hell. Leithart successfully leads students through a more insightful examination of the concept of \\"courtly love\\" and follows through the progression towards true, selfless love. This is a critical understanding for young people to differentiate.  It opened our eyes to truths in Dante's book which, formerly a drudgery, became a favorite in her high school, homeschool education of worldviews.	2005-07-29

His art is magnificent!  The cost of this book is worth it if it were only to have a coffee table collection of his art.  However, I found this book to be extremely well-written and effective instructionally.  The main thrust of the book is to examine the variances in watercolor application as it relates to the degrees of paper wetness and paint dilution.  Using practical terms that demonstrate those consistencies, Zbukvic systematically instructs the student as to the instances in which each combination should be utitlized.  I LOVE the fact that he does not bog down the experienced watercolorist with the token chapters on \\"Watercolor 101\\" skills.  He does share his palette choices and typical technique pitfalls, but primarily sets right out into his technique demonstrations. The text is very interesting, unlike most watercolor books I have in my library.  The only disappointment I had with the book is that, after reading it, I still don't paint like him!  LOL!<br /><br />Addressing another reviewer who criticized the book for using Australianisms like the word \\"tyre\\" and for supposedly mislabling a large painting with smaller dimensions, I would like to refute both of those assertions.  The word \\"tyre\\" is the only Australianism I saw.  There may be others, but it is most certainly not to the point of distraction.  Also, if you will read the text beside the photo described as mislabled, it clearly explains that the smaller painting served as the springboard for the larger class demonstration in the other photos.  The only slight criticism I have of the book is that much of the text is written in a light gray color which was difficult to read in the evenings under lamplight.	2005-07-21

This biography tells the sordid life of Augustine.  Like the prodigal son, he made devastating choices in his life that grieved his parents and family.  A breakdown under a fig tree brought Augustine to the end of himself and to the transforming power of Christ.  Augustine became one of the greatest among the Church Fathers, combatting false teachings.  His work to return the church to the Bible as the infallible Word of God was continued centuries later by Martin Luther.<br /><br />The story itself is powerful, however the book is written in a straight-foward approach that is a little boring for the younger reader.  It openly discusses points of immorality in Augustine's life that a parent would need to handle together with younger readers.	2005-06-21

While this book is designed for younger elementary children, I believe it is more concisely thorough than most high school students will ever retain.  I am using it for late elementary and middle school students who are captivated by the stories which springboard their interest into deeper reading.  We are, of course, supplementing every few sections with an appropriate grade level novel. I love that \\"whole world\\" approach which skips back and forth between the major cultures at each time frame. Most sources overfocus on European World History and eliminate the co-existing and critically, historically important Islamic and Eastern cultures. I would venture to say that most adults do not have the unified historical threads keenly integrated. My \\"kids\\" are learning the basic flow of history with a high degree of retention using this curriculum with historical literature supplementation.      I would skip the activity book due to philosophical concerns (which I have posted under the activity book listing) if it were not true that the maps and question review are very important.     We did add Sherri Payne's Around the World in 180 Days geography program to this.  We hopscotched through the continental studies as we encountered them in SOTW, even breaking down the \\"Define\\" and \\"Term\\" sections into specific areas of SOTW study.  When the year of history was done, 99% of the geography course was done, as well.  It fit together well.  I think the kids appreciated the variety of dividing the continent sections up a bit over the year, rather than an exhaustive study all in one length time frame.	2005-03-26

There are activities which address non-Christian philosophies in an aura of correctness atypical for this author.  I was deeply disappointed when some of the activities even involved having our students act out some customs of other religions including activities using their statements of their faith. This was truly unexpected in what I thought was a Christian approached book.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly agree with teaching our children, at a responsible age level, the major tenets of other religions and agree to teach respect for all cultures and peoples.  I disagree however with statements like:  \\"The words of (other religion's god) should always be expressed with as much beauty and care as possible.\\"  This preceded an activity where the other religion's confession of faith is laminated on a tile for display in our home. ?!?  Other such statements are similarly stated in a way that infers validity and authority.  I highly doubt that the other religion markets books praising Christianity and recommending that our statement of faith be displayed in their homes.<br /><br />Many of the suggested reading contain strong mythological, spirit references in relation to other cultures.  I think it is misguided to blur the lines between fantasy and reality at the young ages this curriculum is designed to educate.  For instance, the activity book recommends the child's picture book \\"Sundiata, Lion King of Mali\\" and describes it as \\"A picture-book account of the great thirteenth-century Mali king who grew from a weak child into a strong warrior.\\" Sounds innocent and historical enough. The book begins with the lines \\"Listen to me, children of the Bright Country, and hear the great deeds of ages past.  The words I speak are those of my father and his father before him, pure and full of truth.\\"  It goes on to talk about how Sundiata was \\"blessed\\" by the spirits of buffalo and lion. Witches try to kill Sundiata, but their \\"magic is useless without his anger.\\" The \\"evil land was ruled by Sumanguru, a sorcerer king, whose huge armies and powerful magic were greatly feared.\\"  Much is stated as authority and TRUTH mixed in with history.  This could be explained to and discussed with an older child, but the curriculum is recommended for younger elementary children.<br /><br />The maps are great (though way too easy for mid-late elementary) and there are many fun activities. It is tremendously helpful to have the question and answers that go along with the textbook.<br /><br />I would strongly caution, however, that the Christian parents scour the suggested activities and remove unwanted student pages prior to embarking into this book.father and his father before him, pure and full of truth.\\"  It goes on to talk about how Sundiata was \\"blessed\\" by the spirits of buffalo and lion.

She gradually becomes friends with him after the two struggle to learn of the differences in one another's cultures. Tenacious Ness and prideful Beorn provide entertaining dialogue! While it is not challenging to convince a young man to read exciting Viking adventures, this book was equally enjoyed by my daughter.	2004-12-29
US	49644638	RKHG4MAW4QEVU	1883937302	274069138	Son of Charlemagne (Living History Library)	Books	5	36	38	N	N	An insider view of Charles the Great	We enjoyed this story of Charlemagne told by viewing the life of one of his sons, Carl.  While not intensely detailed in regards to his historical battles, though they are referenced (and one particularly brutal event is covered intensely), it gives more of an insider view with the focus on his family life.  That was very interesting!  This incredible world leader was a devoted family man who desired for his children to travel with him whenever possible.  He humbly sought a better education for himself, his children and his subjects.  This focus led to the Carolingian Renaissance.  While Charles the Great certainly had flaws, those too were inspiring examples.  These multifacted qualities resulted in his rise from King of the Franks to coronation as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.  Son of Charlemagne was written very personally, a tender glimpse into the real life struggles of a political giant.	2004-12-29

This delightful mystery set in the time of ancient Rome gives in depth details of the life of a Roman without your child realizing they are reading about historical culture!!  It has all the elements of a good book - suspenseful mystery, vivid imagery, intriguing characters, humor, friendship, enemies, and danger.<br /><br />Young students of a Greek schoolteacher have an argument that culminates with a mean statement written on a student's wax tablet.  When that same statement is found written in red paint on the emperor's temple the next morning, their young friend finds himself in serious trouble.  But are things as they seem?  If you are like me, you won't figure this one out 'til the very end!	2004-12-29

Whitsett speaks right to the new watercolor student and breaks things down in tiny steps to insure success. He begins with informing the student of the initial products needed. I found a convenient set of Winsor Newton Cotman Watercolors that had the exact colors he suggests. He tells which paper which I also found very reasonably (Canson). Then he starts with the terms, the color wheel and basic watercolor washes and techniques...both strokes and color mixing. An abundance of pictures illustrate each step and then \\"inspiration pictures\\" are given to show what the development of each introduced technique can lead to. I am thankful to have stumbled upon this as my first book in my art education. Note: The only step that is assumed is that the student can vaguely sketch.	2004-12-28

As my young daughter read aloud, the rest of us became distracted with amusement.  Her stiltedness as a new reader gave the same effect as a \\"Dragnet\\" voice...a must for future reading of Nate stories.  I am so impressed with the author's skill at using so few words to generate so much humor and mystery.  It just hits the bullseye by captivating the kids and tickling the funny bone of the parents, as well.<br /><br />The storyline is a young child detective who loves pancakes.  His observations of the obvious are the source of most laughs and his observation of the not-so-obvious (at least to the young reader) are the source of the mystery.<br /><br />A+ in Reading!	2004-12-14

This precious story is not about a mother's smothering abuse of authority as inferred in another's review.  It is about the love that goes with your child, despite their choices, affirming their independence, and supporting their life. Our kids want to try their wings. A parent's love follows them through good times and bad. It speaks only to the constancy of that devotion.	2004-10-28

This delightful tale set in Ancient China during the Tang Dynasty depicts the story of a young prince setting out for his first journey into the world.  He embarks with a cache of oddly plain gifts destined to convince the leader of a supposed utopian kingdom to reveal his secrets for success. Along the way, the prince faces various hardships that challenge his strength and unveil a greater person inside than he knew existed.  Hilarious humor and sarcasm are interspersed throughout the captivating dialogues.

Why?  Because it depicts Indians in a historically correct manner.  There are historically correct stories that depict Indians favorably, such as The Courage of Sarah Noble.  Then, there is this story depicting the Indian raids that did occur during the time of the settlers.  Let's hope that we are mature enough to face history - the way it is - not in the glossy versions that try to erase the variables in character that exist in every race.	2004-10-28

A young girl travels with her father to establish a new homestead.  Her mother and the younger children must stay behind and wait until it is ready.  When the father returns to get the rest of the family, he meets with unexpected delays. The young girl must face her fears and learn to trust true strangers.

One of the swan couple's cherished offspring has shown the unfortunate \\"defect\\" of an inability to make sounds.

Determined to pay his father's debt, Louis undertakes a series of employment opportunities using his skills of writing and playing trumpet.<br /><br />This story is about overcoming challenges and unconditional love.

An exhaustive account of the history, theology and impact of Islam is presented in a thorough, yet readable form that exposes contradictions of the Muslim faith.  Quoting the Kuran itself for accuracy of representation, The Sword highlights the Kuran's inconsistencies and details the life of a once visionary's descent into a potentially \\"conscious imposter and open sensualist.\\" Restoring our \\"historical memory\\" allows the reader to make an informed descision about the Muslim faith by exposing the media agenda-driven, veiled imposter aspects. There is no subjectivity on the author's part.  He successfully refrains from emotional manipulations and forces the reader to face \\"just the facts\\" by exhaustively revealing the tenets of the faith itself. The Kuran appears laden with historical inaccuracies, progressive changes in theological ideologies, futile philosophies, and presents a harsh god who advocates the murder of elderly, children, Jews, Christians, and promotes licentious sexuality at the expense of those used at the disposal of the chosen ones of Allah.  The unattractiveness of this religion has been concealed from the masses. This review is NOT a derision of Arabic people or a promotion of ethnic discrimination.  In fact, the Sword of the Prophet may even serve as an information source for those Muslims unaware of the religion's frightening origins.	2004-03-02

Eventually, Anabelle realizes the best way to rid their homes of the menacing labrador is to make their enemy into their friend.<br /><br />I am so impressed with this tale!  It just was republished in March. The author skillfully increases your child's vocabulary by introducing challenging words and then providing the definition through the dialogue a clever animal.<br /><br />Your child will learn a valuable lesson on how to deal with others of all personalities.  It will encourage them to look beyond first impressions and get to know one another more thoughtfully.	2003-05-14
