They call themselves the Agonists, and their \\"extreme sport\\" is war surfing-taking fast, and thoroughly recorded, runs through the war zones of 23rd-century labor relations. Their leader is Nasir Deepra, two and a half centuries old, old enough that he lived through the collapse as an adult, and remembers an Earth whose surface was still habitable.<br /><br />Nasir and his aging comrades are at the top of their sport, but they have a weakness they don't recognize yet: Nasir is infatuated with a beautiful physical therapist, Sheeba, who's in her twenties, and too well-adjusted to regard him as anything other than a father figure. Nasir, in his dogged pursuit of Sheeba, will do anything to please or impress her, including strong-arm his buddies into including her on their war surfs. This quickly goes-somewhat humorously-wrong, knocking the Agonists out of first place, and in fact down to fourth place, in the standings but, after some stressful moments melding Sheeba into the team while fatally weakening Nasir's ability to veto a surf he knows will be disastrous, a surf of the orbital factory called Heaven. Nasir is chairman of the board of the company that owns Heaven, and he knows what none of the others do-what the labor dispute is about, and why Provendia is so very determined to hide it. When Nasir's suit malfunctions on the surf, and Nasir and Sheeba find themselves stranded inside Heaven, with its unexpectedly young and naturally suspicious prote (\\"protected employees\\", the 23rd century's lower classes) population, Nasir, the protes, and even Sheeba-the most sensible of them all-are in for some shocking and dangerous re-education about how the world really works, and the reader gets an exciting ride.<br /><br />There are some weaknesses here, and the ending is a bit heavy-handedly sentimental, but this is a fun book, and Nasir, with all his self-deceptions, is another believable, basically decent and likable character.imental, but this is a fun book, and Nasir, with all his self-deceptions, is another believable, basically decent and likable character.	2005-09-23

She's a soldier, a sometime military intelligence operative, a hero of the war against the Syndicates (large clone groups of genetic constructs like herself), friend of the oldest stable Emergent AI, Cohen-and it's all worthless if anyone finds out that she's a construct, rather than being, as her records show, a barely-legally-human person of only one-quarter construct ancestry.<br /><br />So of course, after a very dangerous information-retrieval raid goes wrong, she's sent to Compson's World, the mining world she was decanted and raised on, to investigate the apparently accidental death of a critically important scientist who just happens to have been a construct of the same clone line as Li herself. This is dangerous territory for Li-too many people here know who she is. Even though most of them, construct and human, are pleased that one of their own, one of the always-exploited mine workers, got out, it's still dangerous that they know-and made more dangerous by the fact that Li herself has significant memory gaps, caused by the very fact of her military career and frequent FTL jumps.<br /><br />In investigating Helen Sharifi's death, Li has to pick over the treacherous ground of her own history, the legal status of clones, the sometimes-shaky relationship between humans and AIs, and how far she can trust either her own superiors or her AI friend Cohen. She also has to undertand Sharifi's theories about the Bose-Einstein condensates that make FTL travel possible, and which are Compson's World's only export.<br /><br />This is an interestingly complex and mostly-believable culture, with humans building new cultures in space and on new worlds while Earth is being re-terraformed after an ecological collapse. There are some false notes-I find the idea that the Provisional IRA will be the most important internal terrorist threat, off Earth, two or three centuries in the future, only slightly more believable than the idea that diehard American supporters of the Confederacy will be, and I have to suspect of being the product of the same kind of cultural myopia. This is a background detail, though, and overall the culture here is a lot more complex and interesting than that, just as the science and technology, both biological and otherwise, is also interesting and exciting. Add to that the fact that Li and Cohen are both interesting and engaging characters, and Moriarty knows how to put a plot together, and this is a very good book.<br /><br />Recommended.are some false notes-I find the idea that the Provisional IRA will be the most important internal terrorist threat, off Earth, two or three centuries in the future, only slightly more believable than the idea that diehard American supporters of the Confederacy will be, and I have to suspect of being the product of the same kind of cultural myopia.

US	47535803	RYPKBPEUTJUAA	0446614300	6238905	Orphan's Destiny	Books	4	36	38	N	N	Solid sf military adventure	Jason Wander, having survived the Slug War in Orphanage and risen, to a frightening degree (especially to himself) simply by surviving, to the rank of general and commanding officer of the Ganymede Expeditionary Force, is relieved when a new ship arrives to take him and his seven hundred surviving soldiers home to Earth. Although he has spent the months between the defeat of the Slugs and the arrival of the Excalibur taking every relevant correspondence course that he can, including a lot of military history, he knows he's not remotely qualified to be a general, but harbors strong hopes that he's at least worked his way up to lieutenant.<br /><br />After a journey home that proves he doesn't have the political skills and officer training to be a general in the presence of other senior officers who know what they're doing, he's appalled to discover that he's going to remain a general anyway, because the government needs a war hero as a pr tool. And as the general who defeated the Slugs and saved Earth, he's it. There's no one else who can fill that role. It's especially difficult for Jason because he believes that current US government policy is wrong; the new administration is spending funds on economic and infrastructure reconstruction that Jason, not convinced that the Slugs won't be back, believes need to be spent on building a better defense. His dilemma gets worse once he's made a few tours in his unwanted new capacity: while he's more convinced than ever that every penny needs to be spent on defense, it's also clear to him that, after the years of pounding by the Slugs, every penny also needs to be spent on reconstruction. The government is engaged in the thankless and probably impossible task of trying to divide the available resources to do both at least adequately.<br /><br />It simplifies things, in a quite unwelcome way, when the Slugs do attack again, this time from a spaceship carrying the bulk of their invasion force. Jason is at least confronted with a problem he understands somewhat better, even if dealing with that problem involves lying, cheating, stealing, and disobeying orders. And of course, persuading some of his surviving friends and subordinates from the Ganymede expedition to do the same.<br /><br />This book is in many ways in the tradition of Starship Troopers and The Forever War, but Heinlein and Haldeman were each in their different ways angry when they wrote their books celebrating the infantry. I think Buettner is mostly having fun here (and certainly the reader is), while still celebrating the common foot soldier and trying not to oversimplify and cast Jason's human obstacles to defending Earth as villains, or even necessarily completely wrong.<br /><br />Very enjoyable.ith a problem he understands somewhat better, even if dealing with that problem involves lying, cheating, stealing, and disobeying orders.

Icove Center for Reconstructive and Cosmetic Surgery to investigate one killing-a vid star has been beaten and killed her attacker in self-defense-when the retired founder, Wilfred B. Icove Senior, is killed. Icove is widely admired, loved by all who know him, has no possible enemies. Clearly, no one had a motive to kill him, and the woman who did the actual deed, his lunchtime appointment, apparently doesn't exist.<br /><br />But, since someone obviously did, Dallas starts digging into his work and his past, to the great annoyance of his son, Wilfred B. Icove Junior. Everywhere she looks, she finds more evidence of his wonderfulness. Icove Senior's medical relief working during the Urban Wars helped many people and made him beloved. Both Somerset and Mira are admirers, and Somerset, who knew him during the Urban Wars, is deeply pained by the fact that Dallas is investigating Icove in order to find his killer. It's a painful and awkward investigation-and it gets worse when there's another killing, this time of Icove Junior, and evidence begins to accumulate of research interests the Icoves definitely never advertised.<br /><br />Kazuo Ishiguro reassured a presumably nervous literary world that his new novel, Never Let Me Go, was not science fiction because it's not about human cloning, but rather about the social consequences of human cloning. Roberts, like many a scruffy genre writer before her, demonstrates that she has probably devoted more serious thought to that subject in five minutes while brushing her teeth than the distinguished Mr. Ishiguro has in his whole life-and she's more fun to read, too.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-09-22

Ever since the adults (Luna Founding Father grandmother Hazel Meade Stone, mother Dr. Edith Stone, and father Roger Stone, engineer, former mayor of Luna City, and screenwriter) let their guard slip long enough to let the twins invent something genuinely useful (the frostproof rebreather valve) these native-born Lunatics have been scheming to repeat the accomplishment-at least the money-making part of it-with the not very well thought-out goal of eluding adult control before they've learned enough caution to keep themselves alive, out of debt, and out of jail. When their latest caper involves an attempt to buy a spaceship and launch their own trade expedition to the asteroid belt, grandmotherly and paternal restlessness morphs the scheme into a family tour of the planets, starting with Mars and possibly stretching to include the rings of Saturn.<br /><br />Castor and Pollux of course do not let up on their money-making schemes, and figure out that they can buy used bicycles cheap on Luna, fix them up on the way to Mars, and sell them to prospectors there for a fraction of the price of new bikes shipped from Earth's much deeper gravity well, while still making a huge profit.<br /><br />They do not, of course, ask themselves why no one before them has been smart enough to come up with this idea, and that's a recurring theme as the Unheavenly Twins wreak hilarious havoc across the solar system, with brushes with jail, bankruptcy, and assorted mayhem.<br /><br />(One very funny episode will seem oddly familiar to anyone whose age and background caused them to encounter the original Star Trek first. However, Heinlein's flat cats predated the tribbles by about fifteen years.)<br /><br />Great fun.	2005-08-20

Chet had promised him that he'd nominate him for membership, but died while Max was still too young to join, and then Max's father, before he died also, made him promise to take care of his stepmother.<br /><br />But when his stepmother remarries and she and her new husband sell the farm out from under him, he runs away, taking his uncle's astrogation books with him. The books get stolen from him by a deceitfully helpful conman, and then he discovers that his uncle had died before nominating him for the guild, and all his dreams seem crushed forever. But then he meets that charming conman again, who decides that they can help each other get what they both really want—a berth on a starship. For Max, it's a berth as a steward's mate, and he's tending farm animals again, but he's on a starship, and he's a plucky, resourceful, just plain likable young Heinlein hero, who makes you buy into every improbable plot twist along the way to his dream.<br /><br />Once again, great fun.<br /><br />Update, May 2017: Rereading this decades after originally reading this is interesting. It's still a fun story, with the plucky, young Heinlein hero who makes you buy into all the improbable plot twists. It is, of course, very dated in a number of ways. The improbability of star travel depending on a set of printed books of numbers and equations has often been commented on. The social dynamics of Heinlein's world has been the subject of lots of commentary and discussion, most particularly the often quite rigid gender roles, especially in the &#34;juveniles,&#34; i.e., Heinlein's young adult novels. It's worth noting that he often (but far from always) subverts those roles somewhat. For instance, in this book, Ellie rather testily points out to Max that women are dealing with the reality of the rules they live with. Another woman, an appallingly predatory creature, sheds that behavior when the ship hits a real crisis and there are more important things to do than play social games.<br /><br />And yet Heinlein never really questions those basic social roles, even as later in his career his expectations of what jobs women can hold expands considerably.<br /><br />No, what really struck me this time is Heinlein's unquestioning assumption that starships and hyperspeed trains will exist side by side with dirt farmers relying on mule traction, cooking over an open fire is a mundane necessity for poorer farmers, and the hobos who would have been regularly encountered during the days of Heinlein's early adulthood.<br /><br />It's a world largely unchanged, not from the 1950s, but to a great extent from the 1930s.<br /><br />However, another thing that caught my attention this time is the way characters, major or minor, may be described in terms revealing that they are ethnic or racial minorities, with the fact having zero plot significance. Dark skin or an epicanthic fold are treated merely as mundane items of physical description, part of the normal range of humanity, just like brown hair or green eyes. There's a loud, tiny segment of contemporary sf readership that claims to revere Heinlein and yet thinks this is controversial when today's writers do it.<br /><br />It's still great fun to read--at least for someone who first read it in the early 1960s. No guarantees for Gen Y or millennials, who grew up in an entirely different world than I did!

Dick	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A fascinating book about a fascinating writer	This is in no sense a scholarly work-no footnotes, no bibliography, not even a \\"further reading\\" list. Emmaneul Carr&egrave;re is an unabashed fan of Philip K. Dick who, having read everything there was to read, still wanted to know more about how Dick's mind worked. He pursued this quest through much of Dick's unpublished material and apparently interviews with those who knew him. (I say \\"apparently\\" because the lack of footnotes, while adding to readability, does detract from complete clarity about sources and research methods.) Nevertheless, Carr&egrave;re has produced a fascinating book, and he and his translator, Timothy Brent, have made it a very readable one, too.<br /><br />Carr&egrave;re gives a reasonably full account of Dick's life, while assuming that his readers are those who have already read most or all of Dick's major works, and the earlier biographies. (Cautionary note: this means that, if you haven't read Dick's major works, you should beware of spoilers.) His goal is working out an understanding of his subject's mind from this wealth of material. To what extent did the traumas of Dick's childhood (the death of his twin sister when they were a few weeks old, his parents' divorce, his mother's own obsessions) contribute to his own instability and emotional problems, and to what extent were they merely the background against which his own personality oddities played out? How did his problems and his drug use affect his fiction? How much was the drug use the cause of his later problems, and how much was it an unguided attempt at self-medication? Carr&egrave;re seems both clear-eyed and sympathetic in his descriptions of not only Philip Dick, but also his parents, wives, and friends. This is a highly readable and interesting book about a fascinating writer.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-08-14

Alan (Alex, Andreas) is the oldest, and also the one who can pass for human the most easily and comfortably. In fact, only gradually do we learn that there's anything unusual about him at all, except for his parentage and his casual attitude about what name he gives people-as long as it starts with \\"A\\". Billy (Bob, Ben) can see the future, Carlo is an island, Doug (Danny,) was a perfectly human-appearing monster until his brothers killed him (which hasn't slowed down his career much), and Ed, Fred, and George are nesting dolls. Alan got his early-childhood care and education from the golems provided by his father, the mountain, and then discovered school and the library. After a childhood attempting to raise his brothers (except for Carlo) with decent educations and the ability to blend in to human society, and after a truly horrific experience ending in the death of Doug, Alan takes off on his own. When we meet him, he's a middle-aged, semi-retired entrepreneur living in Toronto, renovating the house he just bought and getting acquainted with the college-age neighbors next door.<br /><br />His illusions of normality are about to take a nasty hit.<br /><br />On the one hand, he's getting sucked into a new project, making free wireless internet access available to the neighborhood, the city, and eventually the world. On the other hand, his brothers, Ed, Fred, and George come to visit, with the news that Doug, whom they thought was safely dead, is back and coming after them. And on the third hand, the kids next door aren't as normal as they look, either. As his brothers start dying and Doug starts collecting allies, Alan clings to his version of normality and pitches free wireless internet access to Bell Canada and tiny city merchants and anarchist bookstore operators, and tries to convince the girl next door that wings aren't a handicap. (Silly Alan; Mimi wants to be normal, too!)<br /><br />All of this could be a recipe for a disaster of a book, and occasionally it does seem to almost spin out of Doctorow's control-but not quite. Somehow it all gels. These characters are fleshed out and interesting, and the story, alternating in time between Alan's strange childhood and his not-quite-normal middle age, is fully developed and absorbing.

In our increasingly wireless world of instant and constant communication, he gives his loyalty not to a state or a company or family and friends he sees regularly, but to the Eastern Standard Tribe-a largely faceless collection of people whose home time zone is the Eastern Standard Zone, who are locked in cutthroat competition with other tribes aligned with other time zones. Art himself is currently working in London, engaged in industrial sabotage against the Greenwich Mean Tribe. Virgn/Deutsche Telekom thinks he's working for them, improving their user interface; in fact he's trying to make it almost unusable. He's got a partner and supervisor from the Tribe, Federico, and a new girlfriend, Linda, whom he met when she staged an accident with him as the fall guy so that she could claim the insurance.<br /><br />For some reason, that doesn't suggest to Art that perhaps Linda is fundamentally untrustworthy and not looking out for his best interests.<br /><br />Art's having fun, screwing with V/DT's user interface, dreaming up a really good, fun, and profitable idea for EST to sell to MassPike, involving rights management for downloaded music. There are frustrations, too, of course, as he begins to dimly realize that Fede might be double-crossing him, trying to steal his idea and cut him out of the deal. There are more frustrations as Linda and Fede make increasingly contradictory and irreconcilable demands on him. Eventually, on a trip which he thinks is to pitch the idea, and a side trip home to Toronto to introduce Linda to his Gran, Art finally figures out that Linda is not his friend, either. He reacts very badly, and winds up on the roof of a mental institution in Massachusetts, trying to decide whether to stick a pencil into his brain.<br /><br />There are some neat ideas here, and the story moves along briskly, alternating between the main story and Art on top of the asylum, trying to figure out what he does next, with quite adequate amounts of suspense. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite satisfy. Except for Art, neither the characters nor the book's main conceit, the Tribes, feel fully developed.

This is the conclusion of the story begun in The Last Guardian of Everness. There is no easy way to summarize the plot, but the struggle to prevent the Darkness from taking over the Earth without calling in the Armies of Light (thus creating a \\"perfect\\" pastoral and static world), continues. Peter, Raven, Galen, Wendy, a brave little mouse, and other unlikely characters, all learn new things about what they are and aren't capable of. (Raven also discovers the great advantages of consulting a librarian, but nobody cares about that so I won't mention it at all.) Oberon and Titania get their licks in, and Wendy's finally puts in an unambiguous appearance, scrambling to prevent the start of a nuclear war in the Pacific and then to prevent (or undo) a coup by the tools of the Power of Darkness in Washington. And those aren't even the important battles.<br /><br />It's all very exciting, and, as always with Wright, very beautifully written-wonderfully easy to lose yourself in.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-07-17

The only way for someone from a developed country to get into space is by joining the Colonial Defense Forces, and the only recruits they'll take are people who are seventy-five years old. There's a promise of rejuvenation for all who enlist, and settlement on one of the colony worlds for those who successfully complete their term of service. (The colonies have in some ways much more advanced technology than Earth, and they're mostly not sharing.)<br /><br />The kicker in this wonderful opportunity for ambitious senior citizens is that out among the stars, humanity is fighting for its life. Or at least for its real estate. There are lots of other star-traveling species looking for worlds to settle, and many of them are looking for very similar kinds of worlds. Many of them also have technology significantly more advanced than even the human colony worlds, making life for the infantry pretty much the living hell it usually is.<br /><br />Anyway, John Perry hooks up early one with a few new friends, and they go through the early phases of adjustment to their new lives together. One interesting question that they obesses about for a bit is, how will the CDF rejuvenate their tired old bodies? Everything they come up with just doesn't stand up to close examination, but obviously the CDF thinks they're worth a good bit of expense to recruit and train, so there must be something they've overlooked. The answer comes as a considerable shock to them.<br /><br />The story is basically a foot soldiers in space story, quite well done, and resembling Starship Troopers and Forever War about as much as they resemble each other-amd differing from them as much as they differ from each other. The background is in some ways more interesting: this is a populated and diverse galaxy, with aliens whose motives are sometimes clear and sometimes not, and some of whom  are hostile and some who are friendly or neutral. Even the government they serve is even more of a mystery to Perry and his fellow recruits than is usual for foot soldiers; it's not their government, or wasn't until they enlisted, and residents of Earth never got any meaningful news or information about the colony worlds. This is a fun and interesting book, that comes to a satisfying immediate conclusion, but there are some fascinating questions left hanging, presumably to be addressed in the sequel(s). Some of those questions involve the aliens. The Consu, for instance, always fight at the technological level of the species they're fighting-and if they lose, they leave that planet forever. There are several theories about exactly what they're doing; none of them really make sense, and it's clear that important information is lacking. Other questions involve the CDF and the colonial government. Granted that Perry's fellow recruits can only come from developed countries; why is it that they're all from the U.S.? (There is one semi-exception-a woman not born in the U.S.-but she was apparently raised in the U.S. after certain events in her childhood.) And what's going on with the Special Forces? These are really Special Forces; even the nice, normal ones that we meet are very souped-up versions of human beings, and there are rumors of really different body types and other strange things out there. There's lots going on here, and I'm looking forward to reading more of it.<br /><br />Recommended.interesting: this is a populated and diverse galaxy, with aliens whose motives are sometimes clear and sometimes not, and some of whom  are hostile and some who are friendly or neutral.

There's no way to say much about this book without mentioning some stuff that is, after all, clear to reader after the first hundred pages or so.<br /><br />  Kathy H. has been a \\"carer\\" for nearly twelve years, and with the end of that life approaching, she has decided to set down her thoughts and memories concerning her privileged upbringing in the exclusive and isolated private school of Hailsham, in some unspecific spot in the English countryside.. She describes a fairly typical, genteel boarding-school life, with some important oddities. There is no mention of families, school holidays, life before Hailsham, or contact with the outside world. There is Madame, who visits periodically to collect the best of the children's artwork, which the children assume to be for inclusion in her Gallery. The teachers at Hailsham are their guardians, and the children know, in a carefully vague way, that they are different in some important way from their guardians, Madame, and all the \\"normal\\" people in the outside world. As Kathy and her friends, most importantly Tommy and Ruth, grow older, they are, as one of the guardians says, \\"told and not told\\" that they are clones, being raised solely as spare parts for real people. Kathy H., with her career as a \\"carer\\"-a sort of combination patient advocate and designated emotional support for \\"donors,\\" clones whose organs are currently being harvested-coming to an end, is about to begin her own few years of donating vital organs until she \\"completes.\\" (The word \\"die\\" is never used in relation to the clones.)<br /><br />  In many ways this is a good book Life at Hailsham and afterwards is beautifully described, exquisitely detailed, touching but not cloying, with a creepy undertone that's fairly effective. Kathy, the passive good girl whose more stubborn or more persistent than she seems; bossy, manipulative Ruth; Tommy, with a temper he can't always control and baffled by some of the social demands on him; these are kids I knew, though I avoided some of them. The problems here are different, and all the more maddening because some of them would be so easy to fix.<br /><br />  I don't have a problem with the fact that Kathy and her friends don't rebel against their fate. They've been carefully raised to believe it's their natural place in life, they're not taught or encouraged to think critically, and they're given very comfortable lives. Once they leave Hailsham, they go to the Cottages-somewhat less comfortable physically, but almost as sheltered, for their gradual transition from students to carers. What does strain my credibility considerably is that, once they're at the Cottages, living with clones raised in other facilities, some of them far less privileged than Hailsham, and able to watch television, read newspapers, and get out into the \\"normal\\" world to some degree, the myriad floating rumors don't include any stories at all of any clones having resisted. There is speculation about who they were cloned from, there are daydreams about the lives they might live if they were \\"normal,\\" there are rumors about \\"deferrals\\" that allow two clones who can prove they are really in love to put off the start of their donations for a few years. There are no rumors at all about clones actively resisting or attempting to escape-no romantic daydreams of successful escape, no cautionary tales of failed escape or resistance, no stories of some carer-provided with a car and necessarily traveling around the country without close supervision, in pursuit of their duites-mysteriously disappearing or attempting to disappear. Nothing. Given that the main burden of the book is that the clones are just as human as we are, and are being used in an inhuman way, this is utterly beyond the bounds of possibility. Human beings everywhere tell themselves and each other stories that both comfort and frighten them. It's what we do. It's what distinguishes us as a species; there is virtually no other human behavior that hasn't been found in some form in other species. Human beings who aren't telling each other stories in order to frame and manage the most important fact of their lives are just not credible.<br /><br />  There is also, apparently, no real outside resistance to the fate of the clones. There is a terribly genteel and polite movement of which Hailsham is a part, making speeches, raising money, and creating foundations to raise the clones in more humane and pleasant conditions, rather than the factory conditions that prevailed before Hailsham and other foundations of its type, and apparently still the norm for most clones. But, in the land of the anti-vivisectionist movement, animal rights activists, and people willing to demonstrate and even riot over genetic engineering on plants and the creation of \\"Frankenfoods,\\" there apparently isn't and never has been any more vigorous movement against human cloning itself-either on behalf of the clones, or out of fear of damage to the human race generally. I harbor no excess confidence in the human race; I see no reason why such a movement would have to be successful. It's perfectly plausible that it would attract nutcases who would do something seriously counterproductive. What I don't believe in is an England where such a movement does not exist at all-especially not since the cloning began in the 1950s, in the aftermath of the end of World War II and revelation to the general public of Hitler's concentration camps. That no such movement ever existed in Mr. Ishiguro's fictional England is another item in the \\"completely unbelievable\\" category. And it could be so easily fixed-the Great Revelation that the book slowly builds toward would be much stronger if the \\"scandal\\" that did the damage were rooted in a real resistance that backfired badly rather than what it's linked to here.<br /><br />  The final difficulty is Mr. Ishiguro's failure to think seriously about the underpinnings of his fictional world. It's the 1990s, and we've got large-scale human cloning for spare parts going on. It's been going on for decades; in fact, it started in the 1950s. Now, in the real 1950s, we had barely begun to even ask the right questions. It was four decades later that the first successful animal clone was created. We're still finding that cloning is different for each species-Genetic Savings & Clone, a real company, is really offering commercial cloning of your deceased pet cat, but they can't do dogs well enough to offer dog cloning yet. (Next year-they hope.) And not only is the failure rate in cloning quite high; the failure mode is pretty horrific. And even in \\"successful\\" clones, significant and life-shortening health problems that didn't exist in the original are extremely common. We're not even close to being able to clone human beings who would live to be born, much less human beings who would live to adulthood and be healthy organ donors. So how does Mr. Ishiguro explain this major departure in the history of science? He credits it to the \\"great burst of scientific progress\\" after the war. Oh, right. Sure. Without major differences in the direction of science before that, it's not possible. The least-major change that would provide a fig leaf of cover for 1950s human cloning have to involve Dr. Mengele making several major breakthroughs in the course of his medical experiments. And that brings us right back to the implausible lack of any resistance to cloning humans for spare parts, and now we need to consider that lack in the light of the science of cloning stemming directly from Hitler's death camps and Mengele's experiments. And we don't even have a token, lunatic-fringe resistance to the idea of cloning humans for spare parts?

And in order to do this,  he has to leave school now, take a job as a servant in Stallery Mansion (home of the local Count), find the person he didn't deal with in the last life, and kill him.<br /><br />  Conrad would almost rather die than leave school and take a job as a servant at the Stallery-but not quite, and he reluctantly boards the tram, armed only with a false name-Conrad Grant-and wine cork and a spell to summon a Walker and get \\"what he needs\\" when he's identified the villain and is ready to do the job. Almost the first person he meets, of course, is Christopher Chant, who's looking for his missing and possibly trapped friend Millie, and has also come to take a job at the Stallery in order to look for.

He does not suddenly discover that this is the life he was born for, but he does, eventually, decide that he doesn't want to fail at this, too, or let down the few people who believe in him. He makes some appalling mistakes on his way to that decision, and it's not smooth sailing after that, but Jason does start to make a foot soldier of himself. When an expedition is dispatched to take the war to the enemy, at their base on Ganymede, Jason and his squadmates are part of it.<br /><br />  This is a book that borrows heavily from all the great buddy war movies, as well as Starship Troopers and The Forever War, and freely acknowledges its debts.

She ends the day unemployed, her career and her reputation threatened, and contemplating the few items left to her from the birth mother murdered when she was a toddler. One of those items is a locket that, when studied too closely, bumps her into an alternate world-the world her unremembered parents came from. In that world, Miriam is the heir of one of the wealthier branches of a clan that has the ability to hope between that timeline and our own. Her home timeline is technologically and politically somewhat behind ours, at about the 15th or 16th century level, and her kin have used their ability to become merchant princes, jumped-up \\"new\\" nobility somewhat resented by the older noble families but highly valued by the king because of their ability to finance him. It's a dangerous world, with conflicts with neighboring kingdoms, conflicts with other nobility, and conflicts verging on outright warfare among the different families and lineages of Miriam's own clan.<br /><br />It's not a comfortable life, but it is a privileged one if you can learn the rules quickly enough, and Miriam quickly finds she's better-suited to the challenge and the danger of it than she might have expected. She's also met a guy-her cousin Roland-whom she's very interested in, and made some friends, including another cousin, Olga.<br /><br />It is a bit of a complication that the head of their family intends Roland to marry Olga, and Miriam to find someone suitable to marry who'll bring her powerful allies within the clan. It's more of a complication that a good bit of the clan's wealth comes from drug smuggling in our world, and Miriam finds this deeply morally objectionable.<br /><br />The really big complication, though, is that Miriam and Roland want to completely reorganize the clan's business model and political structure.<br /><br />And then there's the whole never-adequately-answered question of who, exactly, murdered Miriam's parents, and why.<br /><br />This is a really well-done, enjoyable, world-hopping adventure, with the complications thought out and explored in interesting ways. My only real complaint is that the book stops abruptly in mid-story-Tor apparently took one long book and chopped it in half.

However, humans couldn't function that way, and now we can interact with those lands and beings only in our sleep. The powers of darkness are not entirely please with this arrangement, and are constantly seeking a break in the barrier. Galen Waylock is the latest of a line of watchmen who have guarded the dream-gate, ready to raise the alarm and summon the Power of Light when the forces of darkness at last make their final assault.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, the Power of Light is not entirely benign, either. It has no time for silly modern notions of human dignity and freedom. It's a better choice than the malevolent forces of Darkness, but not by much.<br /><br />  Galen, in his youth and inexperience, is tricked into giving Darkness a tiny opening. While his spirit is having some very stressful adventures in the dreamlands, his body in this world is in a coma. One of the Dark, Azrael, tempts Raven Varovitch, whose wife Wendy is dying, into making a bargain that lets Azrael hijack Galen's body. \\"Galen\\" wakes up, and Wendy experiences an astonishing recovery, and Wendy, Raven, \\"Galen\\", and Galen's estranged father Peter, eventually wind up at the Everness mansion, the gate between the worlds, and things begin to go very wrong, very quickly.<br /><br />  As Peter and the others begin to understand the cost of summoning the Champions of Light, they opt for the third choice when the time comes, and a very odd collection of allies takes up the magical weapons intended for the Champions of Light themselves. Each of those weapons, of course, carries its own price, and mortal human beings aren't well-suited either to carrying those weapons or to fighting the Power of Darkness on their own.<br /><br />  Although the Golden Age trilogy was published first, this is apparently Wright's first novel. It starts off a bit slow, with somewhat stilted, awkward language. Don't let that stop you; keep reading. It soon evens out, as Wright hits his stride, and the rest of the book flows in the beautiful, graceful prose that characterized The Golden Age.<br /><br />  Recommended.er of Darkness on their own. <br /> <br />            Although the Golden Age trilogy was published first, this is apparently Wright's first novel.

The colonists are all clones derived from the people who controlled the ship that dropped them on this world, people referred to as the cr&egrave;che-born, who were then going to leave the system for the next one on the list. Manda is currently the youngest of the CarliPablo group-and the only singleton in the colony. Everyone else has vatmates, giving them twins, triplets, or even quadruplets. Manda's twin, though, died in the vat before they were decanted. This makes her a little strange and somewhat at odds even with the rest of her own clone. With the rest of the colony, it's even worse.<br /><br />  Howver, Manda has managed to find, for the moment, satisfying work that doesn't require her to do what she does badly-cooperate with others. She's exploring the oceans of their semi-frozen world by telepresence-operated waldoes, looking for heat vents that might be favorable spots for the native life, mostly microbes, that they know at least did exist there in the past. This doesn't conflict with her own clone's favored project of mining the methane ice, and it's potentially beneficial to the colony, so she's left alone to do it.<br /><br />  And then, more or less simultaneously, she causes a major social embarrassment for her clone, a accidental meeting with a man from another clone, Jim LuisMichael, leads to some cooperation and a lead on a likely vent, she loses contact with the waldo in the best position to explore it, and a cave-in causes death, devastation, and loss of resources for the colony.

(I'll skip the paragraph about how some of the alternates are uninhabitable, others are Really Bad Places, etc.; you know all that part.) Raw materials are imported from uninhabited alternates; food is imported from less technologically advanced inhabited alternates. Of course, they get a few other things from the alternates, too, such as unwelcome new diseases, but that's not a major issue in this book.<br /><br />  In order to blend in better in the alternates, whole families are trained and sent out to trade, and teenagers Jeremy and Amanda Solters are part of a family that does its trading in the summer months in an outlying city of a Roman Empire that never fell. They sell things just advanced enough that the locals can't manufacture them, while still recognizing the value of them-such as actual clockwork-driven clocks and pocket watches, Swiss Army knives, etc., and buy wheat. The Solters family has been doing this for several years, they're known as regular summer traders in the city, and they know their way around and the local customs.<br /><br />  Okay, now I start carping and complaining. I will, generously I think, give Turtledove a free pass on the question of whether an Agrippan Roman Empire would have likely remained stable for two thousand years. You've got to get your setting somewhere, after all. On other things, I'm less inclined to be tolerant:<br /><br />1.  The Crosstime Traffic traders are calling attention to themselves by selling goods no one else can even passably duplicate. They're further calling attention to themselves by accepting payment only in wheat. So, why are they calling even further attention to themselves by defying local custom and insisting on fixed, set prices for everything-no haggling ever? This apparently is intended to have some social-engineering effect-which raises question 1a: why do they want to do that? They need this improbably stable Roman Empire to remain stable, not suddenly develop its own industrial revolution and modern economy.<br /><br />2.  Allegedly, they've been coming here for several years, and behaving like the locals in order to blend in as much as possible. So, why is Jeremy, in his late teens, apparently encountering so many things for the first time? Why has he apparently had no real training for circumstances he could reasonably be expected to encounter?<br /><br />3.  Amanda is a girl in her late teens, from 21st-century America-later in the century, but apparently not noticeably different socially from our own time. So, the same Crosstime Traffic authorities that saw to it that they were trained in every other way might have expected that she (and other teenage girls in the same position) would find the pervasive sexism of Agrippan Rome quite irksome, and having the judgment of a teenager and the social skills and training of a 21st-century American teenager, might try to challenge it in various ways. When they were training her, they ought to have made clear to her that she can't do that, no matter how tempting it becomes. And they should have made sure her parents knew she couldn't do that. When Amanda does it anyway, she ought to know she's making a mistake, and when she does it the first time when her parents are still around, they ought to know she's making a mistake, and tell her to knock it off.<br /><br />In fact, both the Solters offspring repeatedly call attention to themselves in ways that are really stupid, and become even more stupid after they're cut off from their parents. They do it when they know there's some suspicion they've killed their parents and buried them in the cellar, they do it when local authorities start asking uncomfortable questions about where they get their trade goods. It's pointlessly dangerous, and they're each sensible enough in other ways that they should be able to see that it's dangerous, and they need to be careful, especially now that they're cut off.<br /><br />  It's an interesting set-up, and Jeremy and Amanda are intelligent, likable, resourceful characters, but in a lot of ways this is an irritating book.questions about where they get their trade goods.

Able, having mastered the arts of knighthood, finds himself drawn ever more into the magical side of life in the strange new world he's landed in, as he tries to sort through all his problems and obligations and earn the love of the Aelf queen, Disiri. It's all well and good to say that he fights with and against Aelf, ogres, dragons, giants, and human knights both loyal and treacherous, or that he spends time in Valhalla (Skai) and meets an archangel, but this is Gene Wolfe, and it's much richer and more complex than any description of its elements would suggest. What one might identify as the main line of the story, in this case, concerns Able's efforts to help the peace mission that King Arnthor has sent to the frost giants of Jotunland. Since humans cannot effectively fight the frost giants, and keep losing people and territory to them, they're strongly motivated to achieve some kind of peace treaty. Finding a motivation for the frost giants to do so takes a good deal more inventiveness. Also determination, and inability to recognize when you've been beaten comes in handy, too-and not just for Able. While Able still remembers, and occasionally still tries to tell people, that he's really just a sixteen-year-old boy, by this time he has a record of knightly achievement and air of power that has other young men trying to imitate him as he was inspired to imitate Sir Ravd, back when he first arrived in Mythgarthr. It's a responsibility he doesn't want but can't avoid, and is of course too upright and knightly to duck. And along the way, of course, he finds that everyone he has touched during his time in Mythgarthr and the worlds above and below it affects this struggle too.<br /><br />  I haven't done justice to it, but this is another wonderful book by Gene Wolfe.

US	47535803	RK8XQVASB7TTO	015602943X	798265328	The Time Traveler's Wife	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Excellent literary sf	This is apparently a respectable literary fiction, not that cheap sci-fi stuff. You can tell because it's identified as \\"Fiction,\\" it's a selection of the Today Show Book Club, and the Reader's Guide questions at the end never even hint at the possibility that any other writer has ever dealt with the problems of time travel.<br /><br />Be that as it may, this is a novel about Henry DeTamble, a Chicago librarian who, due to a genetic defect, is a Chrono-Displaced Person--he involuntarily travels in time--and Clare Abshire, an artist, the woman he loves and who loves him. Henry first meets Clare when he's twenty-eight and she's twenty; Clare first meets Henry when she's six and he's thirty-six. The process of getting acquainted is naturally somewhat complicated. Their lives are further complicated by the fact that, when Henry time travels, nothing goes with him. He arrives naked, and for the sake of survival acquires a pragmatic attitude towards other people's property, at least their clothes and pocket money. (He can steal and risk being caught and jailed, or he can approach someone and attempt to explain his problem--and risk getting jailed or committed.) Henry also spends a fair amount of time getting acquainted with himself, as the older Henry teaches the younger Henry the skills necessary for survival.<br /><br />Mostly, though, this is about Henry and Clare, how they cope with their strange relationship, how they struggle with questions of causality and free will, and how they deal, both practically and emotionally, with the problems that Henry's involuntary departures and naked arrivals create. And while their personal relationship is unfolding, we're also seeing the beginnings of a strange, new world, because Henry is one of the first, if not the first, Chrono-Displaced Person, but he's by no means the last.<br /><br />Niffenegger handles the odd chronology of her story extremely well, conveying both a clear sense of confusions and problems caused by Henry's condition, and a coherent sense of the personal growth of Henry and Clare and the growth of their relationship, despite the fact that they're often experiencing the events of their lives in different orders.<br /><br />This is really excellent book, and I'm quite certain my description hasn't done justice to it.ry's condition, and a coherent sense of the personal growth of Henry and Clare and the growth of their relationship, despite the fact that they're often experiencing the events of their lives in different orders. <br /> <br />This is really excellent book, and I'm quite certain my description hasn't done justice to it. <br />	2004-10-17

They have jobs they're really good at, that use the abilities that come from their disability in really valuable ways, in a work environment fitted out with the things they need to help them function well.<br /><br />All's well, or seems so, until their peaceful routine is disrupted by the announcement that an experimental new technique may be able to cure autism in these \\"lost generation\\" adults. The company they work for has bought the research, and the new manager of their division, who has already made it clear that he regards as \\"waste\\" the money spent on their special accommodations, has decided that they are all going to \\"volunteer\\" for the first human trial.<br /><br />This crew is autistic, not stupid, and they do have friends and resources; the coercion doesn't work, but they still have to decide what they want to do. Will it work? Will it fail? If it fails, will they be worse off than they are now? If it works, will they lose the particular talent for pattern-recognition that currently makes them so valuable? Do they even want to be \\"normal\\"?<br /><br />It's not really the near-future setting that makes this sf; it's the trip inside an interestingly alien mind, as we get nearly all of the story from Lou's viewpoint.

US	47535803	R1TU76LXGXT2NP	0425198243	55431338	Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake Vampire Hunter)	Books	3	8	23	N	N	Lightweight fun	This is the twelfth book in Hamilton's \\"Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter\\" series, which is a bad place to start any series. For regular readers, the background has been pretty thoroughly filled in and can be taken for granted, the regular characters all have tons of shared history providing context for their current interactions-and on top of all that, most series, if they reach book twelve, have started to run down several books back.<br /><br /> Nevertheless, despite the fact that I was plunging in cold, with no prior background other than the fact that there was an \\"Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter\\" series, I only occasionally and briefly found myself feeling a bit lost. Hamilton does a pretty good job of salting in enough background and character history that the new reader has a sense, however illusory, of knowing what's going on.<br /><br /> For those as new to the series as I was: Vampires, werebeasts (wolves, leopards, and rats, most prominently in this book), zombies, and other unnatural and frequently nasty things really exist. The vampires and werebeasts, at least, have some legal rights, but distinctly limited ones. Anita Blake has the ability to sense and to some degree control the restless dead, which is the basis of both of her lines of work.  By day (loosely speaking) she's a professional resurrectionist, raising the quite restful dead as zombies for a few hours so that they can answer such crucial questions as \\"what did this clause in your will really mean?\\" By night (usually), she's a federal marshal, the go-to person when a vampire's gone bad and you need him staked, quickly and permanently. In this capacity, she gets consulted by the local police in what are or might be preternatural crimes, a lot.<br /><br /> All of that might be relatively straightforward, if she weren't also one of the lovers of Jean-Claude, Master of the local vampires, and Nimir-Ra of the local wereleopard clan and lover of Micah Callahan, their Nimir-Raj. (No, she's not a wereleopard herself.) But, really, her love life is more complicated than that, and gets more so as the story progresses.<br /><br /> The story opens with a murder, a vampire-gang murder of a stripper at a local strip club, which looks like it might be the work of a serial killer. It's not long before there's another stripper killed, the same way, and the bite marks match those from the first killing. Inquiries also turn up the fact that there have been similar killings in other cities, and it looks like the killers are stepping up the pace. Anita is sure, for numerous sensible reasons, that it's not the work of Jean-Claude or any of the local vampires, but, of course, she might not be totally objective.<br /><br /> Since one of Anita's lovers is a stripper, and another (Jean-Claude) owns the club he works in, she's personally involved in another way, too. And if Jean-Claude's not involved, that's not really good news, either, because it means there's another master vampire in town, powerful enough to hide himself from both Jean-Claude and Anita.<br /><br /> While Anita and the local police, and eventually the Mobile Reserve, are trying to solve the murders before more people are killed, she's also juggling her job as a resurrectionist, where one client wants a resurrection that would be a really bad idea (zombies of murder victims do not play by the rules), and trying to manage her personal relationships along with her growing magical powers and the growing demands of those powers. Those last three things are all, of course, deeply entangled with each other in the most frustrating and inconvenient ways. It all builds towards a satisfyingly exciting conclusion.<br /><br /> I do have several observations, the first of which is not a complaint, but something you should be aware of if you're picking up an Anita Blake book for the first time: There's lots and lots of mildly kinky sex. It's not, mostly, gratuitous, in that it does advance both plot and characterization significantly. On the other hand, the sex scene that took up several chapters, important as it was for plot and characterization, clearly could have been shorter if that had been its primary function. So, if you don't like reading mildly kinky sex scenes, don't complain that I didn't warn you. In this book, if you skip them, you will miss important stuff that matters later.<br /><br /> This next one is a complaint. Early on, someone does a tarot reading for Anita, and one of the things that comes out of that reading is a prediction that she will receive help from someone from her past. At the end of the book, this hasn't happened-and we're reminded of the reading, and the fact that it hasn't happened. This isn't something I missed due to prior unfamiliarity with the series. This is a 658-page book in which major threads are left hanging, the story not really finished. That's annoying. The pace moves quickly, those 658 pages don't ever drag, and there is a conclusion-but this is putting the gun on the mantle in the first scene, and saying, in the last scene, \\"we'll get to that in the next play.\\"<br /><br /> Thirdly-and this is a big complaint, but not directed at Ms. Hamilton. This one is directed at Berkley. Whoever decided that proofreaders were an unnecessary extra expense ought to be thoroughly embarrassed by the result in this book. \\"Liability\\" is spelled \\"libility.\\" \\"Your\\" and \\"you're\\" are repeatedly confused, in both directions. Apostrophes are stuck, apparently randomly, in plurals. An exhaustive list would be exhausting for everyone, so I'll stop now. But Hamilton's a good writer, and she deserves better than this from her publisher.<br /><br /> If you're an Anita Blake fan, you'll surely want to grab this one. If you aren't, but you enjoy vampire fiction at all, this isn't the best one to start with, but you may want to go find the earlier ones.that took up several chapters, important as it was for plot and characterization, clearly could have been shorter if that had been its primary function.

The abandoned equipment and supplies enable her to survive, and she settles into a routine. Months later, on the communications equipment in the colony Center, she listens to the landing of another colony on another part of the planet - and its immediate destruction by natives whose presence no one had suspected. The natives decide to send an expedition to check out the distant other site where the Monsters may have landed; the company that had bought the planet from its previous owners sends a scientific expedition to check out the possibly-sapient animals that had killed their colonists. The old woman, Ofelia, first has to establish communication with the stone-age natives, then with members of her own species. The natives, at least, are willing to believe she's an intelligent being.<br /><br />The natives are interesting, Ofelia's an engaging character - unfortunately, this is an idiot plot, utterly dependent on both Ofelia's complete lack of education and the idiocy of the scientists sent to investigate. The most intelligent, most open-minded, most reasonable member of the expedition is a cultural anthropologist; he identifies a \\"singer\\" in the natives' non-literate culture as an \\"entertainer,\\" nobody important. Why would the company send such incompetents if they spent the money on a scientific expedition at all? They wouldn't, of course.<br /><br />There are numerous similar idiocies throughout the book. For instance, why is Ofelia, the product of a very prosperous, high-tech culture, uneducated to the point of almost complete illiteracy? Why, because education is a privilege, not a requirement, of course. Ofelia's from a large underclass kept intentionally uneducated. That this makes no sense in a prosperous, high-tech culture, that it is completely incompatible with maintaining a prosperous, high-tech culture beyond a generation or two, matters not. (I feel a need to be absolutely clear about this: this star-spanning civilization is intentionally creating and maintaining a large, profoundly uneducated underclass that can't even do the most basic gruntwork in this culture--that would challenged by the basic gruntwork necessary in early 21st-century America or Europe.) The plot requires it, and that's the end of the matter. Ofelia's one of the very bright young children, identified by her teachers for a scholarship to continue her education beyond the basic primary level. Her parents, preferring her sister to Ofelia for reasons never even touched upon, much less explained, send the sister for that extended education instead of Ofelia. Somehow, this controlling, bureaucratic, records-obsessed culture has no means of distinguishing between one underclass child, specifically identified for continued education, and her sister, at least a year different in age, specifically not selected for continued education. Furthermore, and I say this as someone happy to attribute all sorts of evil and malevolence to giant corporations, the corporations that control this society are malevolent in unbelievable ways, ways that are directly contrary to even their most obvious, short-term interests. It all makes for a book that's extremely irritating if you think at all about what you're reading. But if you can turn your brain off, it's kind of fun.ining a prosperous, high-tech culture beyond a generation or two, matters not.

The essential problem is that mathematicians and computer hackers, if they're good enough, can accidentally arrive at solutions that can open doorways to other dimensions, where things dwell that are utterly malevolent and which will consume our entire world if they get the chance. What are these monsters like? Lovecraft wasn't writing fiction, basically.<br /><br /> Bob Howard is a computer hacker who did the wrong kind of really good work and got forcibly recruited into the super-secret, but badly underfunded, agency that deals with this threat. Eventually, he's unlucky enough to get what he asks for-promotion to field work. Suddenly, Bob is dealing with demon-possessed terrorists, philosophy professors who've found a new and different way to get too close to the truth, and threats to the very fabric of existence.  Life is isn't boring anymore. And that's all just in The Atrocity Archive. This book also contains a novella, \\"The Concrete Jungle,\\" the further adventures of Bob Howard through the really dark side of the world.<br /><br /> Very, very good	2004-10-17

It's the first of a trilogy, with the second volume due out in November 2004 and the third sometime in 2005.<br /><br />In 2299, governments have grown larger in a mostly-futile attempt to keep up with the growth of corporations. Shan Frankland is an Environment Hazard Enforcement officer for the Federal European Union, on what will probably be her last enforcement action before retirement. Just after she and her team have seized control of a space station, and before they can begin any s erious investigation, she receives a visit from the FEU's foreign minister, Eugenie Perault, wanting to recruit her for a special job--one involving a trip to what's believed to be a human-habitable world, the second planet of Cavanaugh's Star. With relativistic travel, a round trip will take one hundred and fifty years, Earth time. She, the small detachment of Marines she'll have, and the scientists sent by various corporations will spend their travel time in cold sleep.<br /><br />What's the mission? We don't really know, at first, and Frankland doesn't know, either. She gets a Suppressed Briefing--she hears all the information, and makes the go/no go decision on the basis of it, but then she has no conscious access to the information until the circumstances of the mis sion itself bring the information back to the surface. All she really knows is that there may be a surviving human colony on the planet, and that there are hints of possible alien contact.<br /><br />On arrival, she learns, through a combination of the Suppressed Briefing and contact with the colony, that the colonists are \\"religious fanatics\\"--probably Catholics or Episcopalians, from the few details and the terminology they use--who wanted to grow crops in an environmentally friendly way, and without having to buy seed every single year from major corporations because the crop plants have been genetically engineered not to produce live seed. (Seed for major crops is already being sold with contract provisions forbidding the collection of seed from the plants, to protect the corporation's intellectual property, not to mention their market.) The colonists left Earth with an array of genetic material from plants and animals that were still \\"original stock,\\" or close enough to it, and not the intellectual property of any c orporation. These varieties are now extinct on Earth; all commercial species are now the intellectual property of some biotech corporation or another. The ultimate intention was to preserve those species until the madness of their own time was ended, and then go home and re-terraform Earth. The gene bank the colonists brought with them, if it still exists, would be fanatastically valuable. Shan's mission is to recover that gene bank, if possible, and deliver it to the FEU, keeping it out of the hands of the corporations.<br /><br />What Shan finds is a surviving and apparently thriving human colony, not one but three intelligent alien species, and a war zone. The bezeri are aquatic, the native species of the planet, with a complex culture, but without the technology t o defend their planet against invaders who keep to the land. The isenj are a rapidly breeding, aggressively expansionist species from a nearby world, who colonized the bezeri world with a happy disregard for the ecological consequences for the natives of world-spanning cities that drain their wastes into the sea. The bezeri were nearly driven to extinction by the isenj colonization. And the wess'har are a star-traveling species that take ecological stewardship really seriously--when they received the bezeri call for help, they came, drove the isenj off the planet, and erased their city.<br /><br />The isenj haven't accepted the loss of their colony world. The bezeri population hasn't recovered past the point of danger yet. The human colony, arriving a couple of hundredyears after the heavy fighting, is living in what is essentially a reservation, permitted and even encouraged because of the limited and benign nature of their intentions, but under wess'har influence they have become completely vegan. The status of the human colony is precarious, though, as it is clearly an intrusion in the local ecology, and there's something on this world that the wess'har really, really don't want going anyplace else.<br /><br />With all this, and her slow recovery of the information in the Suppressed Briefing, Shan also has to deal with the scientists, who do not like the restrictions on their activities that she has agreed to--no samples of anything alive, passive scans only of all flora and fauna, no samples of anything without a colonist there to approve it, no venturing outside the encampment without a Marine or colonist as escort. That she has also negotiated full access to the extensive database on the local flora and fauna that the colonists have impresses them not one whit; they're scientists from the most powerful corporations on Earth, and they have the right to pursue whatever studies they want in whatever way they think is most likely to boost their careers.<br /><br />Shan's extensive experience in Environmental Hazard Enforcement, and before th at in anti-terrorism, has not prepared for first contact with three species, negotiating for possession of a valuable genebank, or management of cranky scientists whom she's in no position to either fire or arrest. Circumstances deteriorate rapidly when one of the scientists manages to sneak a \\"sample\\" that turns out to be a stranded bezeri child that would have survived but for her interference. When an isenj force and a newer, faster Earth ship that left home fifty years after Shan's group arrive, things spiral out of control, and the wess'har start thinking seriously about solving their problem by eliminating all of the humans in the system, as well as the newly-arrived isenj.<br /><br />This is a story with a great potential to wander off into unproductive and tiresome rants on present-day politics. It doesn't do that. The problems Shan is struggling with, while involving some familiar issues, are convincingly real problems of her time, not ours. The wess'har have their own culture and their own agenda, which are not Peter Singer's even though he'd probably approve of them. (Whether they'd approve of him is another question.) (They do approve of St. Francis.) The plot comes to a reasonably satisfying conclusion for this book, while leaving the necessary hanging plot-threads for the next two volumes. And while the minor characters are a bit cardboard, Shan and the other major characters are strong enough to spend the time with, reading their story.<br /><br />The weakest feature City of Pearl the Suppressed Briefing, which is a neat idea, but in practice delivers too little payoff for the amount of build-up it gets.

It attempts to cover the entire field, characters, artists, writers, and give at least a basic understanding of the history. Unfortunately, as it says on the cover, \\"Nearly 400 BIG pages!\\", i.e., it's not quite four hundred pages. That's not enough space for in-depth treatment, it's made a bit more cramped by those beautiful illustrations (which, I must say, it would be a shame to lose.). The articles are mostly short, and characters one would have thought important enough for their own entries are reduced to mentions in broader entries. (Bugs Bunny, for instance, is barely mention in the \\"Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies\\" entry.) This is a good, fun book nevertheless, but possibly a better choice for the reader just getting seriously interested in comics, than for the established fan who already has an in-depth knowledge of the field.	2004-10-16

The relationship-wrecking potential of the first two gifts is of course blindingly obvious, and the third would be a heavy burden for anyone to bear-especially a thirteen-year-old who's not speaking to the mother who's screwing up their relationship by trying to avoid all of her mother's mistakes.<br /> These are well-drawn characters who often inspire, simultaneously, the desire to give them tea and crackers and the desire to knock their heads together. Jenny is completely justified and utterly wrong-headed in her resentment of her mother; so is Stella. Jenny is absolutely correct in having concluded, after having it pounded into her head repeatedly, that Stella's father, Will Avery, is a lying, cheating (...)who can be relied on only to let everyone down. Stella is also right in believing him to be a loving, devoted parent who actually listens to her, which her mother does not.<br /> There is a plot in here, involving Stella's gift of seeing deaths accidentally landing Will in jail, charged with murder, but the plot is not the point. The focus of this book is the engaging, and ultimately optimistic, story of the tangled relationships of the Sparrow women and their friends and relations.<br /> An enjoyable lazy-afternoon read.	2004-10-16

The oldest is Hanno, a Phoenician sailor, and the youngest is an African-American slave who eventually uses the name Corinne Macandal. The others who make it to the end of book are Aliyat (Syrian), Svoboda (Ukrainian), Tu Shan (Chinese), Yukiko (Japanese), John Wanderer (Native American), and Patulcius (Roman). Agelessness is not enough to ensure long lives, and we meet other immortals along the way, who from carelessness, bad luck, or deliberate choice, don't survive to share the ultimate fate of the eight survivors. Or rather, as they come to be known, Survivors.<br /><br />Most of the book consists of the adventures the individual immortals in various well-devoloped ancient settings. Hanno joins a Greek expedition to Britain and Scandinavia. Aliyat lives too long in Palmyra while it is changing from a Christian to a Muslim city, and escapes the harem to become a prostitute--in Constantinople for a while, where she briefly meets Hanno, who has become a Rus trader. (Well, Welsh, really, for certain values of \\"really,\\" but the Byzantines regard him as Rus.) Svoboda, already a great-grandmother, leaves her village before she can be killed for witchcraft, to become a merchant's wife in Kiev (and briefly meets Hanno), and later a nun, and still later a Cossack and then a soldier for Mother Russia during the Second World War. (Not for the USSR; the Soviets are better than the Nazis for Svoboda's people, but not much.) Hanno meets Richelieu; John Wanderer, under the earlier name of Deathless, survives the great cultural change brought by the arrival of the horse, and later survives the conquest of the Native American tribes by the expanding United States of America (and meets Hanno. Hanno is the unifying theme in this book.)<br /><br />It's in these visits to different times and cultures that the book is strongest; it's always been one of Anderson's great strengths. Where the book drags a bit is in the late 20th century, where Hanno becomes a remarkably predictable libertarian. Only a particularly petty and unhealthy puritanism, for instance, can possibly explain laws banning smoking in elevators. Hanno's nemesis, Edmund Moriarty, a.k.a. \\"Neddy,\\" U.S. Senator from some unidentified New England state, is a cartoon, about as subtle as a ton of bricks. Even John Wanderer's mild reminders that there are some real problems that are most usefully addressed at a level beyond rugged individualism carry little weight beside the fact that Moriarty's own aide has complete contempt for Moriarty's hypocrisy, evidenced in such telling signs as the fact that he has quit smoking, and the senator is too smugly oblivious to notice. Despite the fact that this is the section in which all the surviving immortals make contact, and the one in which hiding successfully becomes a serious challenge, this is a dull, draggy interlude. There is no explanation, not even hand-waving, for how clever Hanno hides them all from the nefarious forces of modern civilization for the remaining decades before aging becomes a solved problem for everyone. We then have another not very interesting section, set in the same AI-controlled world as The Stars Are Also Fire and other later Anderson works, before the real story resumes. The immortals leave this boring non-story for a far more entertaining encounter with two alien species.<br /><br />Not Anderson's best work, by any means, but very enjoyable even with its weaknesses.imes and cultures that the book is strongest; it's always been one of Anderson's great strengths.

US	47535803	R3TRR03NRF06LE	006050918X	71854520	City of the Beasts	Books	2	8	10	N	N	Disappointing and trivial	Alexander Cold, a fifteen-year-old California boy, is sent to stay with his grandmother in New York while his mother is being treated for cancer. After arriving at the airport to find no one waiting for him, he wanders through an alternate-dimension New York where no one will give directions to a polite out-of-towner, has all his belongings except his passport stolen by a girl around whom, had the plot not demanded it, he'd never have dropped his guard for a second, and eventually winds up at the door of his grandmother's apartment. Grandma Kate is a reporter for International Geographic, so of course she promptly takes Alex off on an expedition to Brazil, to track a yeti-like creature reported to inhabit remote portions of the Amazonian jungle. (This expedition is, of course, the reason his passport couldn't be stolen.) The Amazonian version is known simply as the Beast, and the North American version, i.e., sasquatch, or \\"Bigfoot,\\" has apparently never been heard of, or at least is never mentioned. The Beast is also rumored to have a city, hence the title of the book.<br /><br />Besides Kate and Alex, the expedition consists of two International Geographic photographers, a pilot, Cesar Santos, who's an experienced guidefor jungle expeditions, the pilot's twelve-year-old daughter Nadia, the anthropologist Ludovic Leblanc, Doctor Omayra Torres, and assorted other hangers-on and spear-carriers. After enough initial obstacles have been overcome, the expedition sets out up the Amazon, encountering wild beasts and wild Indians along the way, until the two children become separat ed and have an amazing adventure, learning what the adults are not worthy to know.<br /><br />As you may be gathering by this point, I found this book irritating rather than enjoyable. Some of the problems, the ones involving speaking styles and word choice, may well be problems of translation. For instance, in the sentence \\"Wheeling in the air were birds he had never seen before, some as translucid and filmy as jellyfish, others as solid as black condors\\" on pages 260-261, the use of translucid rather than translucent is probably not Ms. Allende's doing. (The idea of birds being either translucid or translucent is another matter, but leave that aside for the moment.) Likewise, when Ms. Allende wrote the Spanish original of \\"My parents do not tolerate guns. If they saw me with this they would faint\\" (page 130) or '\\"And to think that I have deprived myself of this delicious treat for more than fifteen years!\\" he exclaimed at the second mouthful' (page 240, where Alex finally breaks down and tries eating fish) she may well have had Alex sounding like a normal fifteen-year-old boy.<br /><br />Other things are harder to blame on the translator. Ludovic Leblanc is a cartoon western racist, believing and actively promoting all sorts of claptrap about the bestial nature of the Indians a nd the essential brutality of human nature, even when he has to create the evidence himself. He's completely incompetent, impractical, and quite impervious to facts, reason, or experience until the end of the story, when a single experience changes all his opinions and transforms him, temporarily, into a clear-thinking plotter with nerves of steel. Much is made of the fact that Alex is an extraordinarily picky eater; in fact he allegedly doesn't eat for several weeks of the expedition, because nothing's on offer that's on his short list of acceptable foods. We are repeatedly reminded that Alex is not eating. Why doesn't he collapse from hunger?<br /><br />Then there's the Magic Indian. Now, some of the Indians are magical because it's an integral part of the story. Matuwe, on the other hand, is just magical once, when the plot needs him to be: \\"His sense of orientation was so extraordinary that, although he had never flown, he was able to locate their position in that vast green expanse of jungle and to indicate with precision the place where the International Geographic party waswaiting.\\" (page 333, when Matuwe returns by helicopter with a rescue party.)<br /><br />More generally, except for Kate, Alex, and Nadia, all the significant white expedition members are either villains or dupes--and even Kate is a bit of a dupe. All the Indians are good guys. Indian culture is pure, connected to nature, and good, while white culture is unnatural, fake, bad. It gets tiresome very fast.<br /><br />Besides the failures of logic and characterization, Ms. Allende is also guilty of a simple failure to check easily checked facts. On page 139, we learn this important fact about anacondas: \\"They didn't dare probe around too much, because those reptiles were known to travel in pairs, and no one was inclined to chance another confrontation.\\" This seemed odd to me, and I did a little checking. Amongst the several sources I found that told me the anaconda is ordinarily solitary are [...] and [...] And concerning the Beasts, on page 389: \\"...they're very ancient animals, maybe from the Stone Age, or earlier.\\" Now, maybe Ms. Allende doesn't have web access, but I bet she has access to at least one good library. I bet a reference librarian could help her find out something about the habits of anacondas, or whether the Stone Age counts as \\"ancient\\" on the scale of biological evolution.<br /><br />All in all, a disappointing and irritating book. Don't waste your own time, and don't give this to the younger readers it's intended for, who ought to be discovering what's fun about reading.waiting.\\" (page 333, when Matuwe returns by helicopter with a rescue party.)<br /><br />More generally, except for Kate, Alex, and Nadia, all the significant white expedition members are either villains or dupes--and even Kate is a bit of a dupe.

US	47535803	RDUJ1FYKKG8IH	0380818604	84144543	The Curse of Chalion	Books	5	6	6	N	N	An excellent fantasy	This book would be a stand-ou t among pseudo-mediaeval fantasy novels if only for the fact that it has a believable and well-thought-out religion that actually matters, not only to the plot, but to the characters as well. This is not a fantasy where no one but the gullible believes in the gods, and the clergy are all either dupes or villains. (That the gods are, in the context of the novel, quite real, and take a meaningful role in the personal and especially the political conflicts, has its effect here.) The rest of the background is also fairly well thought out, and while what we see is the portion of the world that the characters, limited to the speed of foot and horse and sailing ship, can reach, it has the feel of extending well beyond that.<br /><br />Chalion is a kingdom at about a 15th century level of technology, with some resemblances in its culture and situation to Spain of about that time--dash and also, of course, a great many differences. The Spanish monarchy, for instance, was probably not actually under a curse, however tempting an explanation that may seem.<br /><br />The Castillar Lupe dy Cazaril walks home to Chalion after enduring many months of captivity as a galley slave aboard an enemy ship, and months of illness in a neighboring kingdom after being rescued. Still far too weak to do most of the things he did before his captivity, he is appointed secretary and tutor to the Royesse Iselle, half-sister of the Roya of Chalion. His life at court is enlivened by the fact that the enemies whose treachery let to his being sold rather than ransomed have become the Roya's most powerful advisors, in some ways more powerful than the roya himself.<br /><br />Gradually he discovers that the royal family is under a curse, a curse that is slowly destroying the family and the kingdom. Desperate circumstances lead to equally desperate measures, and Cazaril learns more about Chalion's history, the gods, and what passes for domestic and international politics in a 15th century setting than he ever wanted to know.<br /><br />Very much worth reading, even if there is one glaring coincidence buried in the plot.cs in a 15th century setting than he ever wanted to know. <br /> <br />Very much worth reading, even if there is one glaring coincidence buried in the plot. <br />	2004-10-15

Exposure to the unfiltered air or water leads rapidly to cancer or other nasty conditions. Giant corporations, now known as Coms, dominate the world, and their privileged executive class as well as many of their protected employees, or \\"protes\\", live in domed cities. The Coms are in a more or less constant struggle with the Orgs, especially the biggest, baddest Org of them all, the WTO. (It's worth mentioning that a significant, and possibly dominant, part of the WTO are its AIs.) The Coms are not the good guys.<br /><br />This doesn't seem like a promising set-up, and I have many complaints about the details. Despite that, I found myself enjoyng the book.<br /><br />Dominc Jedes has wealth and position beyond the dreams of avarice. He's the (cloned) son of the president of ZahlenBank, one of the most powerful of the Coms. If he's lately been having some disagreements with his father, finding some of his decisions affecting protes to be a little too ruthlessly pragmatic, he nevertheless believes in the system and loves his father. His father's approaching death is an added source of tension between them, as the elder Jedes has chosen to forego what aggressive medical care could do for him, in favor of creating a neural profile that will live on in the computer network after his physi cal death.<br /><br />On what proves to be the last day of his father's physical life, Dominic unwisely makes a joke in a board meeting about dealing with the problem of an unprofitable mining sub that ZahlenBank got in a foreclosure by freeing the protes and giving them the sub. This unfortunately strikes his father and the board as a wonderfully clever idea--no costs for continuing to support these now-useless workers! Then Dear Old Dad promptly dies, the freed protes start broadcasting to the world for more discont ented protes to join them, and ZahlenBank is suddenly in deep, deep trouble. The WTO steps in with an offer to arrange negotiations, if Dominic will meet with the protes alone, accompanied only by a WTO agent. He reluctantly agrees, and unhappily finds th at he is accompanied also by the hated neural profile of his dead father. (The NP insists it's the real thing; Dominic does not agree. Dominic also believes it lacks the humanity and honor his father had; I think the evidence is that he had an overly-rosy view of his father.) In short order, Dominic is getting a very exciting look at how the other 90% lives.<br /><br />As I said, I have a lot of specific complaints. The background feels as if it was insufficiently thought out. Europe seems to be about all that sort of survived the collapse. If the ice caps completely melted, why didn't all that cold, fresh water running into the Atlantic do bad things to the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift? If Europe is the last economy standing, why is the basic currency the deutchdollar rather than the euro? And if giant multinational corporations are the bad guys, how can the WTO be the good guys? And Dominc seems quite improbaby naïve. What Dominic isn't, though, is either stupid, or improbably virtuous. He's a basically likable guy who's a product of his society and upbringing. He has believably human and reactions to the individuals he meets, for both good and ill, and alters his assumptions about how the world really works only with a plausible amount of resistance and mental pain.

You were wrong. Someone else has Miles beat by, um, miles. But that's okay; Miles, as usual, has his own problems. There's his brother Mark's new business venture, which involves some rather unattractive bugs, currently stashed in an old laundry room in Vorkosigan House. There's convincing Ekaterin that the fact that she made a mistake in marrying Tien at twenty doesn't mean that she's forever incapable of making good marital choices. There's convincing Ekaterin that he's not trying to manipulate her, which is tough, because he is. He's Miles, after all; it's easier for him to skip breathing for a few days than to skip manipulating people for a similar period. There's Miles' old friend Count Ren&eacute; Vorbretten, whose unfortunate and previously unsuspected Cetagandan ancestry is endangering his possession of the countship--and risks turning that vote in the Council of Counts over to the Conservative Party. There's the rumors going around that Miles murdered Ekaterin's first husband. There's the other countship that's in dispute, with one of the putative heirs trying to blackmail Miles to force the Vorkosigans to support him when the Council of Counts votes on who's the real Count. There's the most disastrous dinner party in, possibly, the history of Barrayar. (Well, perhaps not. Nobody dies, after all. It's just that some people wish they had.)<br /><br />And he can't even run away to be Admiral Naismith anymore. Aside from the fact that Admiral Naismith is dead and everyone knows it, his uniform doesn't even fit anymore.<br /><br />No one has time to give him any sympathy; everyone has their own problems. Ekaterin has persistent unwanted suitors, and annoyingly helpful relatives and in-laws. Mark has his business partner Enrique, and his on-again off-again romance with Kareen Koudelka, and Kou and Drou's reaction when they find out. Ivan has been formally assigned as an aide to Lady Alys, while she manages the arrangements for Gregor and Laisa's wedding.
