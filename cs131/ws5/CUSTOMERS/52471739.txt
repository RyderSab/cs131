Well, it's been a month since I to got this for Xmas and I really love this cook book.  It's my favorite of the 4 low-carb cookbooks I have.  The pound cake is better than the real thing.  The pancakes were good, but all the recipes I've made seem to be a bit bland (maybe lacking salt), nothing a nice pat of butter doesn't fix.  The baking power biskets were quite good even if I messed up the hollandaise sauce for Eggs Benidict.  I can't wait to try more of the recipes in this book.<br /><br />The opening chapters do a great job of explaining the unfamiliar ingredients.  I found all the flour replacements in a local health food store, Whole Foods (soy power, protein whey power, vital wheat gluten flour, whole wheat flour, etc.).  I learned about the low-carb Black Soy Bean and made a wonderful chili (bean soup next?).  This is a great book for us low-carb folks.	2003-02-02

I had no idea jumping on a rebounder worked the entire body so well.  The tape explains personal story examples and a lot of detail on how rebounding works.  The sceince of it was very interesting.  I must run out and get a rebounder now.	2002-12-21

If you already understand and believe that eating low carb is the best way to loose weight and improve you health this is the book to get you started fast!<br />I already own their other books, I think the first Protein Power book is excellent, but there's a ton of details you have to read through to understand how your body works and why this diet is best.  Many other authors have similar books with the same details, but their diets are different.  I believe in PP most.  It's easy to follow, not as strick as Atkins and who doesn't feel good about a married doctor couple writing about this new way to diet.  Actually it's not at all new, Atkins came up with this diet 20 years ago.  The 11/2002 Duke Univercity study has proven the diet safe and more effective than low fat diets, so low-carb is in the limelight again.<br />I was worried the book would be worthless for me since I have many other low-carb books, but it's an excellent quick read and get's you into the details of the diet fast.  I will recommend this to all my friend that want to know how I lost 35 pounds in about 4 months (still working for more).<br />About half the book is text, the other half is menus and recipes.  The menus are great for those that just want to follow a plan and not worry about menu planning.  They are so well planned, they even built in use of leftovers the next day.  All meals are interchangable so if you don't like a certain lunch, just sub with another.  The recipes are very good and get you going.  Many other cook books are available if you want more, but cooking low-carb and finding foods that may be new to you isn't always easy.<br />Buy yourself this book and start the new year out right!	2002-12-21

Wow, this either is a really poor book or the tape is so abridged all the details were lost.  The first tape is basically about making todo lists.  Yes, that may help, but really old news to most of us.<br />The second tape (yes, only two of them) get's into the diet, but again so little detail.  Eat 6 meals a day, meat the size of your palm and starch the size of your fist.  Way too many examples of foods that match that size, \\"A potato is natural's single serving package\\" he said.  I was getting worried as I listened to all the meat and starch combinations (the only detail on the tape), then he finally did talk about veggies.<br />There's basically no information about the activities you should do, just more talk about the times you should commit.<br />Granted this is a tape, but I was sure expecting more from such a hyped book.	2002-12-21

I first bought the book on tape, and wanted more for reference, plus the recipes.  Suzanne makes sense of Atkin's diet, you CAN have carbo's, it's a matter of which carbo's and how you combine them (sorry, no white flour or our beloved potatoes).  Finally a low carb diet that lets you have a more typical breakfast, eating bacon and eggs on the run just doesn't cut it for me.  I love Suzanne and this book is great, buy the tape too, she's a great speaker.	2001-12-02

What a great book, I can't put it down.  They do an excellent job of explaning all the hotels and beaches.  The maps a great and plentiful and all have mile markers, very needed since many beaches aren't on marked roads.<br />They are witty writers I've gotten a number of good laughs.  They snorkel a lot and have many recommendations not only for just the best beaches, but where on the beach.  They explain what side, how far to swim out and warn you of dangers.<br />Great job guys!	2001-10-10

My therapist taught me the technique and it got me off Rx drugs for anxiety (panic attacks).  It doesn't require you to believe in the technique, you start to believe when it works after only a couple of times.<br />I bought to book to learn tapping for other more minor problems after I found how well it works.

The new homes of today are all rated on size not quality of space usage.  This book gives you some great ideas for open space living without giving  up your needed space.<br />I don't agree with some of the other reviewers that  think the homes are boring or too open or too contemporary.  This book does  not show ultra contemporary, cold, white homes.  Rather open spaces with  the warmth of wood and practical use of space.<br />I live in an even more  contemporary home than those shown in the book (some may call it cold) but  I love my open space.  A bunch of little rooms adding up to a ton of square  footage is not what I consider the best option.  When friends see my open  floor plan they marvel over the size of my home, but in seconds ask that  typical question, &quot;How many square feet is it?&quot;, and are shocked  to find that it's much smaller than it feels.<br />I think this is a perfectly  timed book as many of us are thinking of sizing down rather than up.  Who  has time to vacuum a 2400 square foot home anyway.	2000-06-08
