Mission Road is just the latest of winners.  I won't rehash the plot nor reveal the ending, but it's one of the reasons I love Riordan's writing -- just when you think you're winding down to the ending of the story . . .

I love Ford's Leo Waterman series and the first 2 Frank Corso's, but he starting losing me on the 3rd book and I had to start skipping through Red Tide. It isn't that I don't believe bio-terrorism is possible and maybe that really isn't why I didn't like the book, but that topic is just not what I thought I would be reading about picking up a G. M. Ford.  Isn't it enough we have to hear/read about this every day, I wish the mystery writers would leave it alone.  I had a hard time keeping all of the officials straight until almost the end of the book and Frank Corso seemed like just another character.  The whole book just felt like an author's break from writing a series and attempting a stand alone.	2005-07-25

I read Bloodlines yesterday and miss Conn and Jack already.  I won't go into a detailed review as that has been done here already.  I've been reading Jan since the beginning and when I think she can't get any better she proves me wrong every time.

This wasn't a thriller or in the least bit funny.  Hoke Moseley lives in a dump hotel because he has to send his ex-wife every other paycheck and can't afford anything else.  This veteran Miami cop manages to get his teeth, badge & gun stolen when he stupidly sticks his head out his hotel room door without knowing who it is and gets beat up.

It seemed to me a great portion of the book dealt with the descriptions of John Rain performing his SDR's (surveillance detection runs)through the streets of Osaka and Tokyo.  I felt like I was reading a travel book.  The action scenes just didn't make up for having to slog through his scenic narratives.	2004-08-27

I won't rehash the plots as other readers here have already done a great job of that.  Just want to add my highest praise for this author.  I can't think of one negative thing to say.  The characters are human and realistic and the description of the surounding area is captivating.  But most importantly, WKK's mysteries are also great stories.	2004-04-12

I felt as though I was reading a suspense story from a beginner romance novelist.  The dialogue at times was laughable and I agree with another reviewer that the ending was thrown together.  The few sex scenes were like something from Barbara Cartland.  My biggest complaint was the portrayal of the cop Jon Larsen  - he came off as an incompetent dolt.  Through the entire book, the stalker was one step ahead of him to the very end.  However, this writer gets such high praise from other reviewers that I'm not quite ready to quit and plan on checking out the Stone Barrington series.	2004-04-05

Everything about this book was believable, from the characters, situations, dialogue to the well-below zero weather.  I liked the fact that you know who the killers are part way through the book -- the pace of the story quickens as you are now going back and forth between added characters and situations.  I also like that I had compassion for Cardinal concerning the situation with his mentally ill wife, but it was woven into the story in such a way that I felt it wasn't overkill.  I found myself towards the end jumping ahead of the story because I couldn't stand the suspense and then I went back and read more slowly.  Also, just when you think it's all over and resolved . . .SURPRISE!  Highly recommended	2004-04-05

Well, I did read it but realized it contained a litte more substance than many of this genre and liked it so much I ordered When She's Bad.  Leanne takes much-used cliches and makes same old fresh.  It also helps that the added secondary characters prevent the storyline from getting stuck in the rehashing of &quot;we're not suited to each other -- how can I ever trust again&quot; rut throughout the entire book.  So kick out the kids and husband for an afternoon, sit back and enjoy.	2004-03-09

I just want to respectfully voice my disagreement with the many reviews here and other venues that criticize the violence in the book.  I've had this book for over a year and kept putting off reading because of those opinions.  Yes, there was violence and rape, but other than the autopsy description of the first murder I didn't think the author went overboard in a gorefest.  I don't want to give anything away, but as the rapist drugged his victims, the description of the rape and violence came from this drugged state and was somewhat softened.  Okay, yeah, I know - rape is rape, but I wasnt' cringing from the description.  All in all, I thought the book was well paced, had good characterizations and plan on reading Kisscut and Karin's newest.	2004-03-09

I picked it out last night from my over 200 TBR book pile because I figured I could probably skip through large parts of the book.  I finished the book in one sitting (but not by skimming) and now plan on buying L. Banks newest book.  Katie Priss tries to ignore her growing feelings for Michael Wingate because her mother gave birth to 4 children with different fathers and she doesn't want to become known as a &quot;loose&quot; woman as she was.  Michael Wingate was betrayed by a business partner, dumped by a fiancee, and has a mother in a mental hospital and doesn't want to trust Katie.  One of the things I liked about the story was that you knew the personal struggles the characters were going through but the author didn't go on and on about it like some of these types of stories.  Also, while cliches abound throughout, somehow the author makes them work.  All in all, this is a geat book to just sit back, enjoy and let yourself be entertained.	2004-02-10

I whipped through LAR and am almost done with The Last Detective and think they are probably the best of the series.

I won't give away the ending, but I was in tears over the description of Milla's suffering due to a decision she has to make.  I know it followed the storyline and I wholeheartedly agreed with her decision, but it was heartbreaking to read.  Also, I thought we were sort of left hanging regarding the wrap-up of the criminals involved.  Finally, while I loved Diaz, for some reason Milla was not one of my favorite LH characters.	2004-01-19

The character development was very poorly done and characters that I have no idea why they were even introduced or what they had to do with the story.  I mainly got fed up with all the psychic detail that went on and on.  This felt like a short story that the author tried to stretch into a full length book.  Very disappointing.	2003-12-15

Doesn't even come close to Black River, but I don't regret having made the purchase and would still recommend.  No, it wasn't always believable (hey, it's fiction), but the trip across country and the weaving in of past events kept me interested. Frank and Meg once again make it out alive which for me made up for the rather creepy ending.	2003-11-03

I'm not a big fan of violence, but it always seems counteracted by the scenes when Patrick, Ange and Bubba get together and start their &quot;three stooges&quot; routine.  Besides, once I start a Lehane book, the writing just sucks me in and I've gotta stick to the end.	2003-10-27

Although I have many of NR's romances and usually enjoy them, my favorite is the Death series by J. D. Robb, Nora's alter ego.  Having said that, if possible, I would have given Midnight Bayou a 10.  What saved this from being the typical romance between the rich, gorgeous man and hard working beautiful woman, were the flashbacks to the lives of Abigail and Lucien, the addition of and attention to other characters and the fresh dialogue.  I also liked the fact that so much of the story was told from Declan's viewpoint, not Lena's.  It seemed to be a more involved storyline than some of the other NR books.  The ending did seem to be a bit rushed, but I didn't feel it detracted from the story as a whole.  Needless to say, I highly recommend.	2003-10-01

If Looks Could Kill started out okay, but by about Chapter 8 I had to start skimming to get to the end.  The main character just couldn't carry the book and I hated having to read through every single thought process.  Then there was the part with Bailey and her current boyfriend who she finds is cheating on her towards the end -- this added nothing to the story and seems like it was just thrown in for padding.	2003-09-22

Well . . . perhaps the title &quot;Divine Evil&quot; should have been the first clue that this was not a &quot;Dance Upon Air&quot; type book.  I suppose in the romance genre, this story was a little more violent than is expected, but for a mystery, it was very mild.  This was really more in line with NR's Eve Dallas and Roarke mysteries.  I liked Cam and Clare, as well as the supporting characters.  Although not a typical NR's ending, I liked the twist.  I also did not think there was any confusion about Clare and Cam at the end -- you knew they would end up together and they did.  Even though this is an earlier work, I also would like to see a sequel with Blair.	2003-09-16

It contains a much better storyline and because of its length, the romance didn't seem so rushed.  I don't normally like stories with children as they are portrayed as either too cute for words or totally obnoxious.  However, in this case, Austin and Willow were great additions.  One of the readers seemed to feel this book slanted towards the dark -- I totally disagree and can't imagine what part(s) they would have been thinking of to arrive at this opinion.  I would highly recommend Say No to Joe as a book to just kick back and enjoy.	2003-09-10

I also liked her relationships with Joe and Ranger much better in To the Nines -- I didn't think they treated her very well in Hard Eight.

However, I bought it at a discount and thought what the heck -- am glad I did.  I read and collect approximately 60 series, most of them mysteries.  I consider Lowell's Rarities/Donovan series to be romance/suspense and would not expect the entire book to be based on one couple's relationship.  If you want strictly romance, stick to her other books (which I don't read).  I like how Running Scared raced back and forth between all of the characters.  I didn't care for either Shane or Risa in the previous book -- they seemed sleazy and cold.  However, you learn more about them and their backgrounds in Running Scared and how they each fought their way up from a bad childhood to get where they are today.  They both fight the feelings they have for each other (it's not just sex) until Risa's life is threatened which finally brings them together.  From then on, although their relationship isn't always smooth, they know they belong together.  I only have about 3 more chapters to finish this book and I guess I am in the minority, but it's my favorite of the Rarities Series.	2002-10-11

No.  You (and the other characters) think Meg is going to do one thing by her actions, but she usually manages to surprise both.  Meg's relationships with her partner Mike and the investigating cop Reilly are believable and add a great deal to the story.  My only disappointment is learning from C.J.'s website that we have to wait until Fall of 2003 for the next in the series.	2002-08-12

I bought both Bait and Hook based on customer reviews and am thrilled to have found another great series.  Meg is not perfect and, therefore, C. J. Songer provides us with a believable character, not only in Meg's actions, but in her relationships with her partner Mike, stepson Josh and the new man in her life Reilly.  There's no lagging in the storyline and you race along with Meg to the believeable conclusion.  Unfortunately, per C.J.'s website, we have to wait until 2003 for the third installment.	2002-08-12
US	39089968	RNT05OYQKXCCX	0061099716	991089450	Blind Bloodhound Justice	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Not to be Missed	I started the Virginia Lanier series on the recommendations of the customer reviews.  I wasn't disappointed.  How interesting could a series be that spotlights the raising and using of bloodhounds in the field?  I too wondered and happily found out.  The only thing I can add to the other reviews is that after having bought all the books, I learned not to read them back to back.  Although throughout the books, she earns the love and respect of not only current, but new friends and people she works with, her personal life is not always the most uplifting.  Would I still recommend the series?  -- it's not to be missed...	2002-07-22
US	39089968	R3NOSBVYKV3GYT	0440225531	384692874	Cuttings	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Very Disappointed	I tried author on basis of great reviews from other customers.  After wasting time reading the first 5-6 chapters I jumped to the last 2-3 chapters and was glad I hadn't wasted more time reading entire book.  I never felt anything for any of the characters, especially the policeman boyfriend who was about as animated and interesting as a lump of dirt.  The killer was easy to figure out (and I didn't even read the whole book) and the reasoning for the killing left me thinking, huh?  I guess we all have our likes &amp; dislikes and I seem to be in the minority of opinion about this author, but I found Cuttings to be boring, boring, boring.	2002-07-22

Started on a Sunday evening and if I hadn't had to get up the next morning for work I would have stayed up the entire night to finish it.  I kept telling myself &quot;just one more chapter&quot; but there didn't seem a good place to stop.  One of the reviewers commented that this was not one of the best as it was &quot;slow and not in keeping with her usual faster paced stories.&quot;  I plan on buying the entire series and if Burnt Offerings was an example of LKH not at her best then I guess I am in store for some enjoyable long evenings reading the rest of the series.	2002-05-22

Then decided to try her vampire series with Dead Until Dark.  Liked it so much I went out immediately and bought Living Dead in Dallas.  This is definitely not a cozy, but also not as intense as Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake (which I've just started and love).  Turn off the tv, lock the door and just simply enjoy.	2002-05-22
US	39089968	R129YN4Q971YLR	1885173563	82391303	Cheat the Devil (Cat Austen Mysteries)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	We Need More Cat and Victor	I just finished Cheat the Devil and have started Plot Twist, which I plan to read much slower as it is, so far, the last in the series.  I rate Jane Rubino right up there with Jan Burke, Earlene Fowler, Carolyn Haines and Marcia Muller.  Although the romance between Cat and Victor exists, the stories don't need to revolve around it as you become so caught up in all the characters (I want Cat's family) and the solid story lines.  One of the many things I loved about Cheat the Devil is that you are coming upon the end of the book and you THINK the murders are solved and it's a wrap, but then . . . surprise!  Death of a DJ and Fruitcake are also highly recommended.	2002-04-10
US	39089968	R2NWM7MWEL015T	1890768243	353027852	Shiveree: An Eclaire Mystery (Eclaire Mysteries) (Eclaire Mysteries (Paperback))	Books	3	0	2	N	N	What Happened to the Ending?	I agree with the reader who thought the last chapter was missing.  Chapters towards the end of the book where the alibis of all the characters are set forth at length could have been sacrificed to find Claire and Dan opening Christmas gifts and/or if the newlyweds enjoyed their honeymoon, etc.  The first book of this series was excellent.  Love Claire and Dan.  Subsequent books seem to be going downhill.	2002-04-04

I too thought this might turn out to be another attempt at the zany humor so many try, but few accomplish (Janet Evanovich and Nancy Bartholomew being the few exceptions).  The conversations between Jitty and Sarah Booth are funny at times, but what I like the most is being able to not only feel Sarah Booth's love for her home, which goes deeper than just a place to live, but also that there probably really is a Zinnia with people just like that.  I read someone comparing Sarah Booth to Sharon McCone and, I agree -- a softer cousin maybe.  The second in the series is just as good and I'm looking forward to reading the 3rd.	2002-03-18
