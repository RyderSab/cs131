The text is very precise and accessible.  The book covers Black Elk's vision and the events that he and his contemporaries faced at the end of the 19th century.  It speaks to the reader about Native Americans as real people and not as noble savages.  It also covers his time with Buffalo Bill Cody and a bit about Wounded Knee.  The photographs are really very good and informative.  Overall, this small book is a very good introduction for children to the history of the Lakota (Sioux) people.	2005-09-16

The drawings are very simple and the text is good and clear.  The story is divided up into four parts:  The First People, Early Basketmakers (1-450 A.D.), Late Basketmakers (450-750 A.D.), The Pueblos (750-1300 A.D.).  This small book could lead to some very good conversation about Native Americans and using archeology as a tool in learning more about America and its past.	2005-09-15

Godfrey does a decent job of giving a brief overview of the history of the Yosemite (Ahwahneechee)Indians, especially around the interaction of Chief Tenaya and the events that led to the submission of his people to life on a reservation.  The various chapters on food, shelter, dress, basketry, customs, and legends are all informative and interesting.  The photos (black and white) are good.  This brief and informative booklet will serve as a great introduction to the Yosemite Indians.	2005-09-12

The despondent philosophical ranting and speed-induced observations were annoyingly trite and tiresome after the first thirty pages.  While I can appreciate this very self-deprecating genre, I would only recommend this book if you are looking to spend meaningless time reading meaningless flotsam.	2005-09-03

The book is written in the form of a dictionary, with thoughtful explanations under each word, e.g., \\"Advent Wreath,\\" \\"Holly,\\" and \\"Yulelog.\\"  It was very interesting to learn of specific \\"pagan\\" traditions and items which were eventually incorporated into the Christian Church's celebration of the Nativity.

I am currently taking a class on the Old Testament.  In searching for supplemental reading on the Book of Exodus, I happened on this book and am very pleased that I took the time to read it.  While I was not very keen on some of the writing style, which at times is almost too provincial to a fault, I was enthralled to see where common sense and logic led this author.  He politely sets a hypothesis and then provides evidence to either come to his conclusion or to conclude that more evidence is needed.  His sytematic questioning leads to further questions in my mind.  I know that there are always those individuals who feel that all of biblical history is factual as presented.  Mr. Humphrey's writing will make the reader begin to question held assumptions.  This is a very enjoyable read with well constructed chapters.  The maps in the book are useful, but they should be more detailed.  Also, a map of contemporary names for these areas should be included in future revisions.  Indeed, I am very glad to have found this valuable book that will make you nod or shake your head.	2005-01-27

However, most individuals buy art books to see pictures of art and learn some background about the piece, the artist, the time and context of the art, etc.  This book is really meant for the ueber-critic:  there are fifteen pages of an esoteric essay that can hardly keep the interest of a serious art critic much less anyone who is thinking that they might actually learn something about Alessi (other than the basics).  The pictures of the pieces of Alessi are great (and that is why the book deserves any stars at all).  I'm usually not this critical about books, but this book was most likely planned as a coffee table book to show off your Alessi gadgets.  As long as no one actually tries to read the text, you'll be ok.<br />Unless this book is dropped into your lap, leave it alone and don't waste your money!	2004-05-26

After reading it, I'm not really sure if it is appropriate.  The story is exciting.  The character of Jumping Badger (later to be Sitting Bull) is strong and develops well.  The illustrations, while not marvelous, are fine.  Values and morals are taught fairly well in this novel.<br />One of a few things that worried me (as a Santee Sioux person) was the use of the denigrating and dehumanizing word \\"squaw\\" throughout the book.  Among my people, it would be a great, great insult to call a woman such a terrible thing.  I think if the story were to be re-edited, the wonderful word \\"woman\\" could be placed in those instances.  Another instance that worried me was the calling one woman a \\"witch\\".  While there have always been \\"medicine women\\" throughout many ages, the use of the word takes the reader to another place that is not consistent with Dakota/Lakota/Nakota history and culture.  An afterword by the editors on the use of the name \\"Sioux\\" and the words mentioned above may be of good use.<br />These two instances do not deter me from recommending this book.  If anything, they may lead to conversation and a better understanding of Sioux cultures (note that there are more than one) and the use of language around concepts not indigenous to our own culture, i.e., \\"witch\\" vs. \\"medicine woman\\".<br />This is a great book for kids, but they may need a little guidance with it.  I still haven't decided if it would be appropriate for my church's library and will first talk about this book with other elders.	2004-05-26

There is so much to feed on on so many levels.  I was so astounded by the wolf's understanding of his relationship with evil.  He refuses to personify it and yet has realized that his ongoing companionship is not friendship.  I think the story raises questions about humnan complicity in evil and the human tendency towards idolatry (knowledge, science, consuming).  By the end of the book, one has to wonder where the center of the evil that is being described lies:  in the devil, in the wolf, or in the Brothers Grimm?  Schmitz ablilities to make the reader see situations from the view point of the wolf is truly amazing.  It's a good tale and will keep the reader thinking about those big questions about good and bad and knowledge.	2004-02-12

I'm not sure that the characters in the story ever find stability, but they do glimpse at authenticity at moments.  The story is a bit disturbing by its sense of hopelessness and consistent passivity, but then most good existentialist (nihilistic?) tales are like that.  I recommend this book because of the author's great ability to show us the inner emotions (or lack thereof) of his characters.  It is a fast read (I read it in a night), but readers will most likely reread the ending a couple times and still won't be sure of it.	2004-01-21

After reading some of the other reviewers' takes on the believabilty of the book, I have to shrug my head a bit:  it's fiction.  Yes, a lot of it is not quite believable, but those moments move the story on to the next stage.<br />It is interesting to me that the filmed versions of 007 really do not deal with his darker side as much.  He is a dated cosmopolitan sophisticate who also has some rather funny ideas of women and masculinity.  A bit of the homophobic language worried me, but then, as someone else has written, the book is dated and Ian Fleming should be allowed to have his voice.<br />I recommend this book as a good story.  Perhaps it is one of Fleming's weakest, but I think he keeps the reader's attention and works out a good plot, even with its silliness and good humor at times.	2004-01-21

I didn't find the play comical at all--not even darkly comical.  It was indeed a bit dark, icy, and stark.  If the aloof characters' ennui and distain were intended as comical, then the playwright has been writing in some sublime effusion that I can't seem to grasp.  There is some nice poignant dialog every now and then, but I really can't recommend that anyone should buy the book for those rare moments.  Perhaps if it is meant as a postmodern existentialist work, it could offer something to the reader.  I hope that future reviewers will offer their own greater understandings.  My recommendation:  don't spend a lot of money on this.	2003-12-09

I hadn't read it in many years, but my respect has really grown for the playwright's wit and imagination.  What an absolutely wonderful play.  Of course, I love the film, but it was great fun to see how the play moves rapidly and the dialog is so biting and bitter at times.  I agree with all the reviewers.  Buy this play because it is a classic play with ripping dialog.	2003-12-09

This is a central and integral story of the Dakota/Nakota/Lakota (called Sioux by Anglo-Americans)people.  This is a theological story, a story of how the Dakota received the gift of the pipe and its meaning as a communion of the peoples, creation, and reality.

Cosby's storytelling techniques are still at par, but this time around, his stories center on him and not so much on his relationship with family and friends.  Cosby is an artist at humorously sharing his own physical and mental self-awareness with the reader.  This book is a fast and easy read.

I read through it and realized that there was a lot about Mr. Gorbachev that I hadn't known about, especially his early career and disappointments.  While this book is in no way meant to analyze the man and his work, it is a great survey of his life from his years as a young man to his rise in power in the Soviet government.  I do hope that this biography will be reissued with a new section on Mr. Gorbachev's eventual participation in the end of the Soviet Union and his subsequent retirement.  This is a perfect biography for young people.  Even older folks will learn the basics concerning this giant of a man.	2003-09-18

I bought this book as a gift for a friend who is an avid birdwatcher. Before I wrapped it, I glanced quickly through it and took a look at the BEAUTIFUL photographs of the great blue heron.  However, as I read various lines describing the pictures, I began to look around for the associated text.  Eventually, I just gave up and read through the entire book. Not being an ornithologist, I came to appreciate the true beauty and actual wonder of the great blue heron.  Some of the details were specifically for ornithologist, e.g., the various stances and neck movements, but I enjoyed it and learned a lot as a layman.	2002-10-24

The hopelessness of the main character's addiction and the moral emptiness of those around him left me depressed.  His obsession with a man whose love he will never have and the empty sex that fills his needs lead to an ever downward spiral of despair.  This, however, is an interesting read.

On the other hand, if you want a good read which will make you laugh and read on, then this might be the book for you.  Rodi's protagonist, Lionel, reminds me of the Bertie Wooster of P.G.

While some of the pieces were written to be read, the vignettes from stand-up comedy do not always work as well as one imagines that they might in a club.  Some of the pieces already feel a bit dated (the compilation is just from 1995).  However, David Sedaris' writing is great fun.  Of course, the format allows the reader to pick up and put down the book between very short &quot;chapters&quot;; a benefit for such light comedy.

For example, he decries the abuses of the &quot;Zone&quot; diet.  While one may agree whole-heartedly with him, his argument goes on at length (a whole chapter).<br />This book has made me think about my own diet and has moved me enough (with support from Schlosser) to give up eating meat.
