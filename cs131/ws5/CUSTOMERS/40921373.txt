I enjoyed \\"Mystery Walk\\" it works on many different levels. As in all McCammon's books the many layered characters are fully fleshed out, warts and all, they leap off the page. The suspense mounts to the breaking point, an intelligent, witty, well written thriller and McCammon is one in a handful of authors that can actually scare me with words, which is very rare.

Although this little gem was written after Jaws and could be taken as a quick buck rip off, don't let that stop you from enjoying one of the most intelligent and well written books of this type, the 70's had to offer. This author wrote one of the most realistic and uncompromising depictions of conflict and confrontation between human and canine psychology, reading becomes a deeply moving experience. The Dogs has going for it what other Horror novels don't, this book is truly scary!!!. When the dogs attack a victim the author puts the reader into the experience, and it's incredibly unnerving.

A cross between the The legendary Donner Pass cannibal story an old fashioned ghost story, \\"The Shining\\" ect. A synopsis from the back since one wasn't provided above: When Sunlight Fades- The Nightmare Begins... The Butlers and Pruetts were the best of friends, the warmest, most loving of neighbors. And when six-year-old Robin Pruitt died-so suddenly, so tragically-the two families decided to get away from it all. To heal their souls in a quiet, isolated cabin, high in the Wasatch Mountains. It seemed like a good idea. But... How could they have known that a raging snowstorm would trap them in a living nightmare far more horrifying than death or grief? Why would they believe that silly, gruesome legend of madness and bloodshed that consumed four starving souls, a hundred years ago, on that godforsaken mountain? And when would that terrible, endless hunger for revenge rise up and feed on the living, once again?  After Sundown It's Time To Scream For Your Life!!

This book &quot;Shadow Dancers&quot; was every bit as good as anything Thomas Harris or James Patterson has written.

Don't pay attention to the clown who wrote the nasty one-star review.  This book was so much fun I didn't want it to end.  Survival horror that's truly scary, sure it has some flaws (but what King/Koontz horror novel doesn't!)It's a little dated at times and vague at filling in the blanks as to why it happened,(I'm glad it didn't it places the reader firmly in the characters shoes) this is not a book solely about nuclear war it's a book about fear of the unknown: Trying to survive nature out of control, terrifying gory rat attacks, dissention among each other, along with radioactive fallout, and the contaminated survivors, diseases, injury without a doctor ect. Intense unrelenting action, graphic violence, split decisions with catastrophic consequences, sense of doom and dismay that permeates every page makes for a thrilling read...(The Rats are the real stars of this story) this is not a boring book and it would make a great movie.	2004-04-01

This is My personal favorite Science Fiction/Horror novel that I've ever read, I'm 39 yrs. old and I can still remember digging through my dad's Science Fiction books in the basement of our house when I came across this book, I sat down and read it in 2 day's and what an exhilarating frightening experience it was, one I will never forget. Unfortunately I compare everything to this brilliant story and it's a tough sell, so far Lucifers Hammer, RingWorld by Larry Niven and The Wanderer, Conjure Wife by Fritz Leiber even come close in the sheer power of storytelling. I am still wondering why this hasn't been remade by hollywood with today's technology and actually follow the story this time(unlike the british version), it would be the movie event of the summer. Other stories worth reading by John Wyndham are Out of the Deep, Trouble with Lichen, Re-Birth, The Midwich Cuckoo's they are to put it subtly... awesome!.

This book starts off great building slowly and creating an ominous atmosphere...creepy! but by the time I got to the middle of the book I started to get angry, instead of enjoying myself I spent more time critiquing where the story was going and how events were being executed. John Coyne is not a bad writer he just can't hold my interest for an entire novel. This idea has been done before but more successfully, Jack Ketchum's book 'Offseason' which is about a group of young people who visit a friend in Maine, who rent a summer house in the woods. Unbeknownst to them their is a wild inbred family that hunts humans for food and they're watching the house!, what follows is the most savage, harrowing, gut wrentching, ultra violent, goriest fight for survival story  that has ever been written and it was so controversial when first released in 1981  that it nearly destroyed this writers career. Offseason is the scariest book I've ever read, it's so brutally realistic and horrific it's beyond your wildest imagination. Unfortunately The Hunting Season is none of the above, it's a mild lukewarm version(with a few good scares)for people with a delicate constitution.	2004-02-20

I loved these old films and I never forgot them. It even reminds me of the drive in movies I went to in the 70's, I think I've seen every horror movie ever made.  This book was great(it's vaguely similar to Dead and Buried by Chelsea Quinn Yarbo but not by much with a touch of Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and would make a great film!. Knight's writing style is straight forward full throttle  ahead, it's easy to read, unpredictable, suspenseful, scary, with realistic characters (that you can actually care for).  I don't pay attention to the blurbs they put on books like &quot;If you like Stephen...&quot; everyone writes as an individual, it gives people false expectations about what they're about to read.

The Republican party isn't known as the intellectual party in the U.S. and the world for that matter, that's precicely why you(the sheep)and your herd of right wing raisen brains are the targets conservative spin doctors aim their mind control diatribe at. Obviously you don't read, you couldn't share your insights on the content of this book, which is a brilliantly researched and written wake up call to the world, Americans are bombarded everyday in this country and it infects every aspect of our lives; on T.V., the radio, in books, newspapers, magazines, movies, corporations ect. and these people of the Republican party  have gotten their dirty fingers into everything, they're running rampant and out of control, someone should stop them!, call them to the table for their indiscretions. Fortunately there are people of a higher intellect(aka,liberals) who can't be spoon fed large doses of fascist poison by radical, angry, propaganda merchants; OReilly, Hannity, Coulter, Limbaugh and their ilk!(for me that is a true blessing), these @$$holes are so obviously transparent, I just change the channel in absolute disgust.  Like my dad once told me \\"If the Republican party was to ever unite and pull together, it would become the most dangerous organization the world has ever seen\\" and this was coming from a libertarian! and that was 23 yrs. ago! I didn't realize just how prophetic this random statment was......SCARY!	2004-01-07

[The Stand] is overwrought, overlong, totally silly, ton's of useless description, dull and drags in the middle, populated by village idiot's (aka.rednecks), a stupid hillbilly villian, a disapppointing ending, incondite dialogue, all around bombastic and unbelievable....I could go on, but I'm boring myself. If the best editor in the buisness would knock out 500 pages of filler this could be a 4 star book. So, if your're in the mood for an end of the world epic, Try reading [Fire]-Alan Rodgers, [Swan Song]-Robert R. McCammon, [Year Zero]-Jeff Long, [Children of the End]-Mark A Clements, [The Bridge]-John Skipp and Craig Spector, [Nightworld]-F. Paul Wilson, [Blood Crazy]-Simon Clark, [Dust]- Charles Pellegrino, they are far superior to [The Stand]. Don't believe most of the reviews you read about Stephen King's book's(only half are awesome). The King Zombies(aka Mental Pygmies) will say anything to get you to read his book's, probably because taking on one of his juggarnaut size novel's challenged their raisen sized brains! and it felt like a life fulfilling achievement. What?... don't believe me?...watch how many 5 star reviews will pop up after this is posted to try and silence me, Hmmmm... could it be to keep his rating's up?!

The Summoning is about a group of people who have to save their town from a Cup-hu-girngsi a chinese vampire (and it sure is weird). Some weak story transitions and simplistic writing are sometimes distracting and annoying, but I was so fascinated by the evil characters especially the wicked priest and his black church, I just couldn't put the book down. The heroes are pretty laughable and corny, I couldn't wait for them to die horrifically. Mr. Little's writing reads like a teenager's work in creative writing class, The story seems like it was thrown together in a few days, need's to be fine tuned, some passages rewritten. This is a pretty scary read, pretty gruesome in some part's, (no one is safe in this book [especially children]) most horror fan's will enjoy it. I currently purchased most of his books and can't wait to start reading them.	2003-12-21

Stephen King's books I've discovered over the past 20 years have always catered to the most common denominator(namely blue collar people) his horror novels are some of the only ones that have actually scared me, while annoying me at the same time and they almost always have the same recycled characters; writers, village idiots, neglected women or abused wives, lonely drifters, red necks, goofy villains,ect. His books usually start off pretty good with rich characterization and an intrigueing premise, but as you progress to the middle they start to get bogged down with too many plot twists and mind numbing descriptions, sometimes annoying dialogue, irritating protaganists always doing something illogical, by the time you reach the end of the story it really starts to fall apart, incondite dialogue, ridiculous reactions to dangerous situations, mountains of descriptions the size of the Himalayas, suddenly at the end the story it falls flat on it's face.....SSPPLLAAAAATTT!.  This book is actually better than most of his later work, it suffers from some of these, but like Carrie it's mercifully shorter and to the point, and yes it's scary.   They made two film versions of The Shining , though Kubrick's version actually improved on the book slightly, by taking out alot of the silly sometimes cartoonish moments (like the bush animals in the maze coming to life , giving the kid a minimal role Thank GOD!, giving Jack an axe instead of a mallet) making it a darker, deeper, creepier, psychological thriller, too bad he forgot to put in more dialogue(a Kubrick trait) to flesh out the story! (prevents it from being a 5 star film).  The new version is a WRETCHED train wreck avoid like the plague! horrible is too delicate a word to describe it. Read This book, you might like it better than I did.	2003-12-17

Let me start by asking this question \\"are you tired of reading Koontz, King, Laymon, or Saul?\\" I know I am!.  Muriel Gray's a fresh new voice in the festering bog of horror, she's an excellent writer, sort of a combination Gary Brandner, Thomas Tessier, Rex Miller hybrid.  Her first book [Trickster] was well written, suspenseful and scary. Overall pretty good...not bad for a first novel.  Unfortunately she's being compared to Dean Koontz...ICK! whose first novels weren't even half this good!(don't beleve me? try [Shattered], [Twilight Eyes], [Demon Seed], [Coldkill], they're ultra stinkers!!!),People of a higher intellect might find them  predictable, stupid, commercial garbage.  His books are littered with cardboard cut out characters, sprinkled with generous amounts of incondite dialogue(especially his child protagonists who say the most unbelievable, intellectually insulting crap ever put in print). Most of his novels have sell out endings (happy! happy! joy! joy!) everybody feel warm and fuzzy, this is not what I read horror for.  His books(along with King's) don't translate well to film.  Stephen King (Blue collar horror), who unfortunately they're also comparing poor Ms. Gray to,(whom she's nothing like) is not a fair assessment, it gives readers false impressions and expectations!....she is an original! just let her stand on her own, she's a wonderful storyteller who writes gripping, hard hitting, straight to the bone marrow horror! and currently the best female author writing now. I hope to read more of her in the future. Try reading \\"Casting the Runes\\" by M.R.James a classic short story that obviously inspired this book or watch \\"Curse of the Demon\\" an excellent film adaption.	2003-12-15

Richard Laymon's the most overrated (hack)horror writer out there(I've read 4 of his books and they all stunk), Read him only as a last resort or if you are easily entertained. Mr Laymon's writing style is immature, opportunistic, uncreative, sloppy, and plain old fashioned stupid.

My favorites so far are all his short stories, I guess I gravitate more towards his simpler books (Cujo, Misery, Carrie, Deloris Claibourne, which were excellent) instead of King's epic travesties (Dreamcatcher,IT,The Stand)	2003-12-02

Mr. Tessier's not had as successful career as many other better known hack writers (King,Laymon,Koontz) he's had bad publishers, shoddy packaging, absolutly no promotion. \\"Phantom\\" is not his strongest work but it's definately not boring either, it's also a very short scary book and he doesn't bog you down with an excessive labrynthine plot, he's a very visual thinking person's writer of psychological horror who gets right to the point. Give him a try I certainly didn't regret it, I own everything he's ever written and when I get discouraged with the hacks I'll pick up one of Tessier's and reread it.<BR> Brief Synopsis from the back cover since one wasn't provided above;  Ten-year-old Ned Covington is afraid.

Flawless writing and thorough research puts this book marginally ahead of &quot;Killer Clown:The John Wayne Gacy Murders by Terry Sullivan,Peter T Maiken&quot; and miles ahead of the homophobic &quot;The Man Who Killed Boys:The John Wayne Gacy,Jr. Story by Clifford L. Linedecker which is written with a to the point, cheap, sleazy flair.(like those awful Pinnacle True crime books with their hack writers)  What makes this book so much better is it doesn't rely on cheap shocks and sordid discriptions to get it's point across and has a much more thorough account of what took place both before, during and after the murders.  I felt at the end I knew more about Mr. Gacy than I ever really wanted to know...Truly Sick and bloodcurdling!    If this book interests you try a few of these: The Man with Candy-Jack Olsen, Freed to Kill:The True Story of Serial Murderer Larry Eyler-Gera Lind Kolarik,Wayne Klatt, Angel of Darkness-Dennis McDougal they are really good! and really scary!

If you ever wanted to know how dangerous some religious cults are and what their twisted belief systems can bring about, then read this book.  What you are about to read is not what the author intended or was trying to convey in his book, it's what I believe. The mormon religion is the fasttest (and most dangerous) growing religion in the world it is estimated that by the year 2080 it will be the 3rd largest, what a truely frightening future(and vision)this world has in store for it.(Thank God! I'll be in heaven by then). A world where men belittle their women making them subserviant, uneducated, pregnant slaves(not that it's a bad thing) to be used at their whim.  The Mormon Church accumulate's wealth at an enormous and alarming rate! money buys Power! and they're using it to bribe senators and congressmen to influence or pass whatever agenda or bill they think best represents their incondite belief system. They should rename their cult &quot;The Church of Divine Profit&quot; because that seems to be the driving force behind it.  &quot;You too can live the way of the self righteous! just send $29.95 and we will send you a heart&quot;.  What I find particularly frightening is there never seems to be a shortage of poor, lonely village idiots who want to belong to any club, regardless of how misguided or depraved.  Most fools believe they're so important they belong in a better place when they die.  Personally, If I were GAAAWWWDDDD; I wouldn't even bother with  the human animal(I'd wonder where this virus came from) I'd pitch all of you kicking and screaming into the fiery pits of hell and start all over again.  This time I would add a smaller brain that works on the fundamentals of love, acceptance and understanding(I thought that's what religion was about...HMMM?) instead of ingnorance,intollerance,hatred and wealth.  This is what religion all boils down to...FEAR OF DEATH! Enough...  READ THIS BOOK you won't regret it and I may even let you in heaven.  XXXOOO	2003-11-18

Don't be fooled!... Now...don't get me wrong this guy is a good writer he has many awards under his belt.

This is the most realistic horror novel ever written (I have read it 5 times) and I absolutely love it. There are no devils, aliens, or monsters of any kind, just two psychologicaly messed up kids(which one is the evil one? or is it both?) who play an imagination game that goes horribly out of control,  awesome twist ending, this book will keep you riveted for hours on end. Mr. Tryon creates characters that are so true to life you swear you met them before or they really existed at some time. This book is intelligent horror written by a late great author who doesn't suffer from verbal diarrhea like some of the popular present day writers.
