I own over a dozen books that are supposed to be &quot;up-to date field guides to dinosaurs&quot;. But none of them can ever compare to this. Most other books like this are scientifically inaccurate by now. For example, they show velociraptors with scaly skin, like those seen in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. BBC's &quot;Walking With Dinosaurs&quot; was supposed to be updated, but many dinosaurs looked horribly inaccurate. This book is written by an authoritative author and lavishly illustrated by, in my eyes, the most talented dinosaur artist alive today. It has everything that &quot;Walking With Dinosaurs&quot; didn't had. It is full of awe-inspiring illustrations of dinos in action. The dinosaurs look so frighteningly realistic you almost think you've been taken back to the age of reptiles. But these dinos don't look like reptiles. They occupied the same niches as elephants, giraffes, lions, tigers, and wolves does today. Therefore, the authors have also carefully studied modern wildlife to make these interpretations of the prehistoric creatures. For example, the sail-backed meat-eater Spinosaurus could actually have looked more like a 40-foot pelican than the dragon seen in &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. And Velociraptor probably looked like a sharp-toothed fish eagle with claws on its wings!The book provides amazing new looks on well-known dinosaur species like Stegosaurus, Diplodocus and T-rex, as well as some of the most recent and bizarre discoveries, such as the funny-looking Masiakasaurus, the smallest dinosaur Microraptor and the dawn tyrant lizard, Eotyrannus. The book begins with a short introduction to dinosaurs, and on page 30, the field guide begins. It is divided by period and continent. Each dinosaur is presented with several color and b/w sketches, a short description, size, and possible behaviour of the dinosaur. Of course, the behaviour is just based on guesses, but it's an interesting read. The images makes this book more than a field guide - it'sa true art book. It makes you want to start drawing dinosaurs yourself, or write stories from the mesozoic. I'm currently planning an upcoming dinosaur comic book, and a lot will be based on the look and behaviour of the dinosaurs presented in this book. <BR>Over all, this is by far the best general dinosaur book I've ever read. Packed with facts, and lavishly illustrated, this book is a must have for anyone who's interested in dinosaurs. For the laymen, it is a fantastic journey into a lost world. And all paleontologists, buy it for the artwork!I promise you, it's worth it!	2003-08-17

When the highly anticipated film came out in theatres, I was immidiatley looking around to see what new interesting books that would accompany it. I was actually a bit disappointed - there were just simple books like \\"LOTR: Visual Companion\\" & stuff like that. They are fun (I own them too), but I was looking for something like \\"The Art of Star Wars\\". And finally, this summer, it came - The Art of Lord of The Rings!<BR>And just in time for birthday - I was so happy I had tears in my eyes when I received it as a gift. <BR>Well, let me get you to the point. \\"The Art of LOTR\\" is filled with hundreds of wonderfull pictures. <BR>The book is divided into four chapters. IÂ´ll give you a quick summary of them one by one, to give you an idea of what`s inside the book. <br />1. Locations<BR>This is by far the largest chapter, and one of my favourites. The digitalized landscape paintings of Rivendell and the great watchtower of Amon Sul, as well as the amazing interior sketches of Moria and Isengard are highly impressive and awe-inspiring. <BR>The idyllic pictures of Shire and the mysterious paintings of Lothlorien also gives you a magical feeling.<BR>This chapter is also the most varied ; it has everything, from the simplest interior sketches of Bag End to the impressive landscape views of The Misty Mountains and the frightening, burned-out shadow land of Mordor - especially a huge painting of Sauron and his army of orcs. <br />2.Costumes<BR>If there is any chapter that disappointed me, it is this one. <BR>For the first, the characters aren`t very well drawn. For the second, the images only shows the finished concepts - not a lot of unused stuff, like \\"The Art of Star Wars\\" does, for example. <br />3. Armoury<BR>This chapter shows a wide array of interesting concepts for armour. There are multiple designs for axes, swords, and other weaponry. And the sketches of Sauron are absolutely marvellous ; he`s just so evil-looking and cool at the same time. <BR>The pencil sketches of this chapter are perfect when you shall begin drawing swords, for example. They`re simple, yet complex. <br />4. Creatures<BR>This is also a rather large chapter and what makes it very interesting to me is that there is a huge amount of unused concepts - like the orcs, for example. There are dozens of sketches which are very unlike the ones seen in the film, and there seem to be an endless array of concepts for them. They look like goblins, rats and god knows what!<BR>\\"The Watcher in the water\\" is also given multiple desings, although it has less than a minute of screentime. Nearly all possible sea monster concepts seems to be mixed here - and I find it just awe-inspiring. But the real treat of the chapter is 14 pictures of the Balrog, both pencil sketches, paintings and maquettes, showing different sides of it - from reptilian to human-like, before finally evolving into the fire creature we see in the movie.  <br />The book ends with a few credits, and a pair of preview pictures for \\"The Art of LOTR: The Two Towers\\" (coming 2003), which I can barely wait to have in my hands!<BR>Over all, this book is a wonderfull blend of fantasy art and sketches, and definitley what all LOTR fans that want more than just the film have been waiting for. It`s like a dream coming true. So, there is just one more thing for me to say: GO BUY IT!	2002-09-15

Well, now I own all of the \\"visual dictionaries\\" for the Star Wars films, and I highly enjoy them all. They`re informative, colorfull and entertaining to read. <BR>If you want to know more about the characters, seeing the movie isn`t enough. And these books are a good way to get more information.<BR>The fact that the original trilogy had one Visual Dictionary for all three films is a pity, but as each of the prequel films will have an own 64-page dictionary, the room for details is rather big. In this one, there are more information about the lesser known characters/creatures/locations than ever before.<BR>Some of the characters, I could barely even spot in the movie.<BR>As we are familiar with most of the good guys from the visual dictionary of \\"Episode I - The Phantom Menace\\", there aren`t as much info about them here as in the last book, but the new villains of Episode II, like bounty hunters Jango Fett and Zam Wesell, dark jedi Count Dooku and the separatists, are given lots of attention here. There are litteraly hundreds of pictures here. Some of the most interesting parts are the Coruscant underground, as we get to know more about this planet, which has previously been briefly represented in the last two books. <BR>Over all, I can recommend this one to anyone who enjoyed the new Star Wars movie and want to know more about it. An exciting and entertaining book that the whole family will love!	2002-06-30

Well, I must say I bought this book based on reviews I`d read here. And I do not regret it. <BR>\\"Tropic\\" is absolutely wonderfull. At 12 x 9 inches and 4 pounds, it`s a huge book which isn`t appropriate for long journeys but it makes an excellent coffee table book. <BR>In fact, I think it`s the most incredible achievement ever done to portray the nature of one country. Printed on black, very fine paper, it`s a nice book looking through. <BR>The book is divided into the following sections : Seas, Islands & Littorals, Forests & Savannahs, Mountains & Inhabitants(which are actually a vertical journey through the land, from the bottom of the sea to the tops of the Andes). The vertical views of the colombian coast are absolutely gorgeous and awe-inspiring. There are also many majestic, almost poster-like pictures of pelicans flying towards the sky, inside caves and above the surface of the water. The closeups of many fishes are also a feast for the eyes, as are the beautifull flowers of the rainforest. The fantastic views of the Andes makes anyone wish they were there. And the first picture of the book on bromelias with the blue clouds and the sun melting down in the horizon will open more \\"wow\\" and \\"aahh\\"`s than fireworks of the millenium. <BR>This book may be expensive, but if you come across a copy, do not hesitate to take it - it`s worth the money, I promise you that.	2002-06-27
US	45897246	R3J5J6UPM1YVV0	0792282248	320554383	National Geographic Dinosaurs	Books	5	74	76	N	N	Excellent overview!	Well,this book is finally an updated overview of the prehistoric era. I would like to classify it as a modern version of &quot;The Ultimate Dinosaur Book&quot; which I also own,but this one is much better. On 192 pages,it is of suitable length and the format is excellent too. <BR>It begins with a presentation of the dinosaurs with chapters like &quot;What is A Dinosaur&quot;,&quot;The Age of Dinosaurs&quot;,&quot;Discovering Dinosaurs&quot;,&quot;How They Lived&quot;,etc. <BR>Then,it does a good job presenting 53 of the most well-known dinosurs,like T-rex,Triceratops and Stegosaurus,as well as some lesser known such as Pelecanimimus and Therizinosaurus. The profiles are well organized,with a drawing of each species accompanied by some short fact files about name,size,time,place and classification,as well as some interesting facts about discovery,and possible behavior. <BR>Because I am commonly interested in more scientific dino books,I bought this one for another reason than the fact,though that`s nice having too: the artwork!<BR>There are about 30 double-page illustrations by paleoartist newcomer Raul Martin. Each picture is worth a thousand words!<BR>Some of them,like the cover illustration,are just breathtaking. <BR>Never I`ve seen so many awe-inspiring dinosaur images by one artist. His way to capture the majesty and beauty of this creatures is just fantastic!All of the elements - light,habitat,color,and motif - are very well combined to really fit with each other. The style sometimes reminds me of Tolkien artist John Howe. There are two main types of paintings in this book: the first type are peacefull but mysterious,and the second type are bold and dramatic,featuring terrifying encounters with allosaurs,raptors etc. <BR>Over all,he is a really talented artist and I`ll keep looking for his future work. <BR>Well,I hope you can excuse me for mentioning too much about the art,but for me it`s more than a fact book. It is an art book!<BR>The text is quite easy to read,which makes it suitable for ages 11 and up,I think. <BR>So,I can recommend this to most people interested in dinosaurs. For kids,it is a perfect information source which they`ll love. And to paleontologists: buy it for the art!Just open the book and look at the first illustration on page 18. It will blow you away!	2002-03-29
US	45897246	R2DDQFBB1ZIPI8	0312194331	464139995	After Man: A Zoology of the Future	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A fantastic view of animals to come!	Well,as soon as I saw this book,I wish I`d written it myself. <BR>It is an extremly fun reading and the names of these animals often rim on the names of today`s animals (unfortunatley,I only own the swedish ed. of this book so I cannot give you any samples here).<BR>Anyhow,Dixon thinking what almost no other scientists had thought before him : what happens if the humans become extinct?<BR>He thinks that the humans are a turn-back in the evolution. We won`t evolve further. When the mankind has destroyed most of the world`s natural resources,we won`t be able to survive any longer. <BR>After man,the chaos in nature will rest for millions of years. But after 50 million years,we have a new animal world,rather similar to today`s,but with different animals. For example,Dougal Dixon thinks that the mammal group Carnivora (the main predators today)will die out almost completley and be replaced by THE RATS!The rats are some of the most adaptable creatures today and they`re not highly developed,so chances are big that they will become something in the far future.<BR>And instead of gazelles,we`ve got some kind of antelope rabbits. The rabbit is yet another very adaptable creature which is supposed to evolve further. And the blue whale (of course erased by man)has been replaced by a 50-foot penguin!<BR>The hippo is also replaced by a gigantic rodent,and the order of elephants is also an extinct order. Now,there are giant antelopes instead. And instead of the lion,there is a giant baboon as the main predator on the african plains. <br />Dougal Dixon has made both a fun and inspiring read with this one,accompanied by beautifull illustrations. But he hasn`t just let his fantasies flow out - in fact,he has investigated the possibilities of evolution,based on ancient evolution. And animal world like this is isn`t an impossible idea for the far future. Why should life become extinct soon?<BR>If no natural disaster happens,the life will probably continue to live until the end of our solar system,in five billion years or so. This idea has inspired me to think what the animal world will be like even further into the future. May be a gold age of birds will rise?<BR>Or a new animal group which has yet to be evolved?<BR>Only the nature knows....	2002-03-07

Aragorn (the human),Gimli (the dwarf),and Legolas (the elve)has now left Emyn Muil to save the hobbits Merry and Pippin from the evil orchs.<br />Frodo and his best friend Sam now decides to enter the shadowland of Mordor alone,because it is too dangerous to enter it for the others.<br />This book is divided in two halfs. The first half is about Legolas,Aragorn and Gimli`s adventures. First,they meet up with Gandalf (that might come as a surprise to many)and then leaves to help King Theoden of Rohan to fight the orchs.<br />Merry and Pippin escapes the orchs and meet up with Treebeard,who is some kind of living tree - an ent.<br />The second half is about Frodo and Sam`s adventures on their way to Mordor and Mount Doom,their encounter with the creature named Gollum and a really terrifying monster named Shelob.<br />Over all,this sequel is very exciting. It is fun to read two adventures which takes place at the same time,but on different locations. The first book introduced us to the Middle Earth with detailed descriptions etc,but this one is more like just a great adventure. If you like action,this book will not disappoint you.<br />There is a lot more action in this one.<br />Over all,all of the books are like one great adventure. Like the first book,this book has a little unclear ending too (but I won`t reveal what)to overgo directly in \\"Return of the King\\",the last part of the series.<br />As for what I remember,this was the most exciting book to read as there happend so much. It doesn`t feel slow at any time. There is always something. And Tolkien has chosen to put out the dramatic sequences here and there. There is no time when it`s just \\"action,action,action\\" and \\"talk,talk,talk\\". He varies it deeply in all of the books. And I really appreciate that.<br />Now,the first film has already been released and I am now awaiting to see the big screen version of this book. But don`t forget to read the book too. If you don`t read this,you`ve really missed great litterature!to put out the dramatic sequences here and there. There is no time when it`s just \\"action,action,action\\" and \\"talk,talk,talk\\".

This book is a true classic,and it`s popularity is enormous.<br />And why,you could easily understand when you read it. I would be surprised if there exists any person who hasn`t heard of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or J.R.R.Tolkien.<br />The plot is a true classic,which has inspired a huge number of other books and movies (among them Star Wars and The Wheel of Time). 19 rings were once made. Nine for the mortal men,seven for the dwarf kings,and three for the elven kings. But the Dark Lord Sauron also created his own ring - The Lord of the Rings,whose power will make good into evil because of temptation!<br />The nine mortal men where once mighty kings,but became Sauron`s servants by temptation.<br />Sauron was finally defeated by a human named Isildur(though his spirit continued living in the shadows),but then he also became evil when he took the ring. Later,the ring took his own life and he dropped it into the river,where it remained undiscovered for 3000 years.<br />Thousands of years later,the hobbits (a kind of small people) wants to live in peace,and having nothing to worry about. One of the older hobbits,Bilbo Baggins,cheated himself the almighty ring from a creature named Gollum,and suddenly,the servants of the dark lord finds out where the ring is. Bilbo leaves the ring to his relative Frodo. The wizard Gandalf decides that the ring has to be destroyed - that`s the only way to defeat Sauron forever. Frodo later becomes the leader for The Fellowship of the Ring,which consists of four hobbits (Frodo,Sam,Merry and Pippin),the wizard Gandalf,the two humans Aragorn (or Strider)and Boromir,the elve Legolas and the dwarf Gimli.<br />And I think most of you recognize those characters,so I don`t have to explain in detail who they are. The fellowship is now thrown into a fantastic adventure,where they have to meet a thousand dangers on their way to Mount Doom.<br />What amazes me mostly with this book is how complex the world is. And imagine Tolkien has found out all of it himself!He really must have had a lot of fantasies!But this isn`t just some wild imaginations - because the world feels so complex,it is so real you can believe it really has existed. He creates detailed cultures for each of the people in his Middle Earth,like comparisons between different religions today. Over all,the world is similar to the medieval Europe,but with fantasy creatures like dragons as well.<br />As Tolkien was an expert of Nordic mythology,he also figured out the names like Frodo,Bilbo and Gandalf very easily. And The Middle Earth is actually an english translation from the Swedish Midgard,which was the place where the humans lived in the nordic mythology. That could be interesing to know.<br />Many people claims the book is too short - and sometimes,I do agree. A hundred pages more would not have been a bad idea.<br />Over all,this is a difficult book to review,because there is always something that remains incomplete.<br />Now the book has been made into a film,which is one of the most popular today,but before you see the film,I recommend you to read the book. It`s not enough having seen just the film and skip the book. You have to read it to really understand the whole complexity of Tolkien`s world.<br />The three books are all in all like one great adventure,but this is my favorite,because it is the most classical and introduces us to the Middle Earth.it himself!He really must have had a lot of fantasies!But this isn`t just some wild imaginations - because the world feels so complex,it is so real you can believe it really has existed.

This is like a sequel book,released ten years later,which is even more remarkable. <BR>Because it is so huge,it is usually too broad for most book cases. Therefore,I have it laying in my bookcase,instead of standing. <BR>The book is introduced with a story of Doubilet`s life and how he came in contact with the underwater world.<BR>Every picture is worth a thousand words,but I have got some favorites among them. <BR>One is a picture of a tuna skeleton,which is very unusual - a tuna that has met a natural death,not captured by man. The stingray pictures (one of them the cover pic),are also very remarkable,and truly portrays the grace and beauty of these magnificent but dangerous animals. <BR>The black and white photos of Sea lions and Mantas are also spectacular,and in b/w,they become even more artistic. <BR>The enormous schools of Jellyfish are also rather impressive. There are many good pictures of sharks in this book,especially white-tipped reef sharks and an incredible picture which truly portrays how fearsome a 20-foot great white really is,when throwing it`s jaws against the cage. <BR>There are also some ultraviolet photos of corals,which are quite spectacular too. And so are the scorpionfish pictures,especially of the Rhinopias,which is the most well-camouflaged fish in the world. <BR>And there are so many more,which would take an entire book to mention. As my review cannot be that long,you`ll have to buy the book for yourself and find out what the other images are. <BR>The book perfectly captures the beauty,mystery,danger,and wonder of our oceans,with a varied library of images. It is quite inspiring,and my stories &quot;The Magic Shell&quot;,which are about marine animals,will partly be based on the look of these habitats and animals. It really makes your fantasies lift off. Just open the book and look at the intro picture of a sardine school beneath the waves. It will blow you away!	2002-01-11

It is telling details that I did not even knew afte reading the books,about the characters - what`s their real names (if they`re called something else),their personality,their origin,etc. <BR>It is also a great information resource on the different cultures of Tolkien`s Middle Earth (the hobbits,the elves,the dwarfs,etc),and what makes them different from each other. <BR>With lots of good photographs from the film,as well as citations that describes the characters,it becomes an interesting and entertaining read. <BR>But is it complete?<BR>The answer is NO!<BR>Where are Gollum,Balrog,King Celeborn,the Misty Mountains,and the mines of Moria?<BR>They`re not here,anyway!At least not much info about them. The two first guys are not included at all. And more info about them would have been very nice. <BR>Let`s hope Gollum is included in the companion volume of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;.

Well,after reading &quot;Dinosaurs!The Biggest,Baddest,Strangest &amp; Fastest&quot; and &quot;Dinosaur Imagery&quot;,I`m receiving the third great dinosaur art book,which can almost be classified as a follow-up and companion to &quot;Dinosaurs!&quot;. <BR>It is mainly written for children in the ages of 10 or something,but I still find it very fascinating as it provides entertaining information on what the dinosaurs may behaviored and looked like.<BR>For the first,the dinosaurs of this book are mainly cretaceous,so if you`re a fan of stegosaurs or sauropods,this is nothing for you. But if you like the small theropods,there is no better art book.  This book is like a dinosaurian sightseeing guide - it begins with a short introduction,then chapters about American,South American African,and Asian dinosaurs. Each continent has very special ones - in North America,you`ll find T-rex and Utahraptor,in South America we meet the bizarre &quot;buldog&quot; dinosaur Carnotaurus,the fearfull Giganotosaurus and the strange Amargasaurus with a sail on the neck!<BR>The asian dinosaurs are perhaps even more bizarre,such as the Therizinosaurus with 3-foot claws,and the dinosaur-bird link Sinsauropteryx. Special attention are given to the feathered dinosaurs,and he puts feathers on nearly all meat-eaters under a tonne!<BR>It ends with a short chapter about the most weird &amp; wonderfull dinosaurs,like the most deadly dino ever to live - Deinonychus,which looks more like a stupid turkey than a horror lizard,but is still a perfect predator,with 6-inch claws!And the recently discovered Byronosaurus and the Jurassic Park favorite Velociraptor are also given some attention,especially the picture when the raptors are playing in the snow,which is an image that just feels so moving and uplifting I almost want to move myself! <BR>After reading this book,I really had some thoughts about dinosaurs. They may didn`t looked like most people imagine. May be they weren`t so unlike the present animals,but in some way this makes them even more fascinating and wonderfull. The restorations of this book can`t barely be described in words ; you have to see them for yourself to fully know what I mean. <BR>I will also base my upcoming dinosaur comic on the look and behavior of these &quot;Extreme Dinosaurs&quot;. <BR>If you wish to have a dino art book with just one painter,then there is no better than this!So buy it!	2001-12-25

After that year,my interest in dinos sank and did not returned until quite recently,so I did not had my eyes focused on paleontology. But when I read about new dinosaur discoveries on the net,like the feathered Sinsauropteryx,the value of this book sank immidiatley. <BR>For example,Seismosaurus is no longer considered the world`s longest  dinosaur - it has been replaced by Argentinosaurus. And T-rex is neither considered the world`s largest meat-eater any more - it has been replaced by two others as well.<BR>So,if you want an accurate book,this is not the right one.<BR>It will provide the dinosaur-loving children the wrong information!<BR>But now,I won`t let this review be occupied only by the negative comments. It does have some light sides too!<BR>For example,it provides very usefull information on dinosaur classification. Each group (theropods,sauropods,ornithopods,armored &amp; ceratopians)is presented in detail,with a few species from each,the theropods beeing represented by most. All of the most popular are presented in at least two pages,some times five. Some of those are Iguanodon,T-rex,Triceratops,Stegosaurus,and Apatosaurus. <BR>There are lots of good illustrations of skeletons,as well as drawings of what they might looked like in life,and at last,models of them.There is also some fast facts corner on each dinosaur. Here,the most important facts are covered,like size,when it lived,family and order,distribution,food,etc. <BR>At the back of the book,there is also a quite accurate index of all 638 dinosaur genera described at that time,and if there are any synonyms,like Dynamosaurus,there is always a &quot;=&quot; which refers to the right name of the dinosaur.<BR>So,my final word about this book is,it is great,but wait until there comes out a revised edition before buying it. <BR>But if you want a suitable book,not too childish or not to technical either,this is the perfect one!	2001-12-11

Well,to begin this review I must say that this is an incredibly interesting behind the scenes (BTS)look at one of the most successfull films of the 90`s. <BR>I don`t think Ive ever been looking forward to any film as much as this (may be except the Lord of the Rings),and it was really a pleasure to watch it,although I was a little bit disappointed on the childishness of the movie. <BR>But with the incredible special effects,I was more than pleased to see how they were done. And I bought this book and became very happy. It contains nearly all you need to know about SW Episode I. It follows the movie as it developed from beeing just an idea to the most impressive CG effects movie Id ever seen by that time. In the introduction,George Lucas says how he had to develop an entire new world,which is an interesting read about how he created the new characters and locations. Anakin needed a mother,Obi-Wan needed a master and Palpatine needed an apprentice. The first chapter contains some great preproduction artwork and notes for every drawing. They are really nice,and definitly worth having (some of them does not appear anywhere else). It also has some notes when looking for good cast. They needed a man who looked like a new Alec Guiness for playing Obi-Wan and they needed a 8-year old boy who could really act to play Anakin. That wasn`t easy to find.<BR>There are also some pics of the fantastic clothes featured in the film,as Amidala`s dresses.  <BR>The second chapter is mostly about the shooting itself. It is interesting to see how the stunts were performed and how they built up all the locations on Tatooine. There are also some good shots of the cool masks that people wore during the podracer sequences. In this chapter,there are also lots of interviews with the crew,especially George Lucas. <BR>The third chapter is about the special effects and it`s named &quot;I could do whatever I wanted&quot;. If you didn`t knew this already,I can say that Lucas was planning this filmalready in 77,but he waited until now,because now he could create all of the fantastic characters and environments with the help of todays computers. There are lots of interesting BTS images here,such as the podracer arena - one before,with just about 50 people,and one when after the CG adding,with thousands of people. And it looks terrific!<BR>At the back of the book,there is a complete list of all people that were ever involved in the project,taking up approx. 15 pages!<BR>Over all,this is a great Behind the Scenes look at Episode I. <BR>It has everything you could ever want from such a book. So if you have any interest in Star Wars,behind-the scenes of cool movies,or just special effects,then this book is definitly something. And if you think there is too little artwork,don`t worry - there is another book named &quot;The Art of Star Wars&quot;. Buy both of those and the Visual Dictionary and your Phantom Menace collection will be complete!	2001-12-02

This is a real treasure made by professional aquarists Riehdl and Baensch.<BR>In fact,this 1000-page book covers ALL of the information you`d ever wanted to know about basic fishkeeping. It is introduced by some pictures and good tips of decorating &amp; creating a natural aquarium. It also has a few samples of how to place the aquarium (in the wall,on a bench,etc). <BR>A Piece of Advice: feel free to decorate your aquarium with art objects,because I have done so with mine,and the fishes seem to be thriving as well,although the authors of this book says it is a half-bad idea. <BR>Anyway,let`s continue. The book covers every aspect on water quality,techniques,lighting,and much more. It has also a glossary of chemical terms worth to know. <BR>Then,the plant section comes. All of the aquarium plants I have at home can be identified here. It contains lots of usefull information as well. <BR>But the probably best part of the book is the huge section for identification &amp; keeping of fishes. The section is taking up most of the book and identifies over 600 fish species,with detailed species description. I own over a dozen freshwater aquarium books,but this one is with no doubt the most helpfull. It provides detailed information,and every time before buying a new fish,I read about it in this book. Some times I read twice,as I want to be really sure that I can keep it in my aquariums. All fishes have requirements - and some times they are very high,as with cichlids,so they cannot be kept in small aquariums or with other fishes. I also control that they have the right Ph requirements for my aquariums. <BR>If there are any gender differences in a species,or special reproduction behavior,it shows more than one photo of a fish - as with the guppies,there are more than 30 varieties,and all of them are pictured here!<BR>What is also helpfull is that the book is treating ALL the synonyms of their scientific names,both the plants &amp; the fishes. For example,I often encounter the common pleco under the name Plecostomus plecostomus,but in this book it is named with it`s right name Hypostomus plecostomus,and that is also something which no other book does. <BR>It has so far proven to be very helpfull on all ways when selecting fishes.<BR>The last chapter treats fish diseases,and what to be used when they have Oodinium,for example. Often,this is a section poorly explained in many books,but not here. If you have another book,you might have to call some pet shop for getting advice,but I don`t have to do such a thing when having this one. <BR>I also have to mention that this book has a very large full index. One for subjects,one for the right fish names and one for synonymous names. And that could be extremly helpfull. <BR>And for you who think there`s not enough species covered in this one,don`t worry!There are 4 books more,and this is the smallest!I also own the photo index,which covers 4000 species. See my separate review of that one for more information.<BR>Over all,this is the ULTIMATE AQUARIUM BOOK and a must-have for every aquarist.	2001-11-24

Well,I am a great fan of the SW movies as I own them all and have watched them a couple of time,knowing the names of nearly every character and creature that appears.<BR>But if you`re a real fan,you shan`t just watch the movies. And if you want to see how it all began,then this book is a must have!Concept art of every character and creature appears in this book,along with comments by the artists,mostly Iain MacCaig,Doug Chiang and Terryl Whitlatch. NOTE: if you`re not familiar with the characters of the film,then this review can be hard to understand. <BR>My friend owns all the art of books for the old films. And yes,they are very fine too,and includes the screenplay,but the artists for them are not as talented as these. Of course,the numerous sketches of the queen`s costumes are splendid,as well as the sketches of Obi-Wan &amp; Qui-Gon,which helps me drawing better people sometimes,but these are not the real highlights of the book. The real highlights are the sketches of Naboo`s and Tatooine`s forest/desert habitats and their inhabitants.<BR>Many of the creatures here did never made it into the film,as the giant armadillos of Tatooine and the birds of Naboo. They must have been inspired by real animals when creating them,and they really look fantastic. Now I can create own fantasy animal worlds based on these pictures,although I have not done that yet.<BR>Another highlight is the numerous sketches &amp; paintings of Jar-Jar Binks. Nearly all the artists had to collaborate to make a good,goofy character. He even looks like Donald Duck some times!This might be the best example of a character`s development. In fact,I think that Anakin Skywalker looks better on these sketches than in the final film. And so does Boss Nass too!<BR>There is one more development example worth to mention. And that is Darth Maul,the best Star Wars villain!<BR>In fact,he began as a witch,but that was too frightening,so they changed him into various knight forms,before the final red/black tatooed face came in. <BR>Over all,this is a very great and inspiring art book and could be recommended as a great gift for anyone interested in Star Wars,storyboard art or just sci-fi art as it is.	2001-11-21

Already when I first looked inside it,I knew it would be amazingly suggestive for me. And I bought it. It was rather cheap for beeing such a book. <BR>It features all kinds of deserted landscape from the US.<BR>Some times,it doesn`t look much like desert,mostly in the Mojave,which the first chapter is about. Deserts are not at all lifeless places - in fact,it is full of wild palms,beautifull flowers and cacti with artistic shapes. <BR>The second chapter treats the Sonoran Desert,and it,too,contains more of the diverse flora,especially the red cactus flowers. <BR>In the third chapter,called Colorado Desert - Life on the Rocks,there are lots of such pictures too,but there is one special image that catches your attention immidiatley - pressure ridges in a salt pan,which looks like the finest crystals ever found!<BR>The fourth chapter shows other kinds of desert. For you who like rocky deserts,this is something. It has fantastic sceneries from hundreds of feet high rocks,as well as a picture of dunes with white sand. That is the most lifeless of all deserts and the quietness is sometimes even frightening. <BR>The fifth chapter is about The Great Basin Desert,and that is the largest desert of North America. Many pics in this chapter contains really fantastic views,and you`ll even find SNOW here!In a desert!Just amazin,isn`t it?Some of the most inspiring pictures are found here,and therefore,this is my favorite chapter. The special with those pictures are the mud formations at dusk.<BR>The sixth chapter is \\"Painted Desert\\",which is also very inspiring,and here there are some pictures of the Colorado Plateau,which is fantastic rock formations where fossils of my favorite animals can be found (dinosaurs!). Many of the formations here are well-known from Western Movies. In this chapter,amazing pictures of Grand Canyon can be found as well.<BR>I have now realized that this is my No.1 inspiration source for my animal stories. When I am drawing them,I am always looking at pictures of this book to find a suitable background for my dinosaurs. I am combining the best pictures. And then it is just to add the dinos. When I read this book,I pretend that I am trying to create a good dinosaur movie when looking at the pictures. It is incredibly inspiring,and ABSOLUTELY something for anyone who likes painting or look at landscapes. <BR>You could spend (money) for \\"The Western Horizon\\" or (less) for this one. The choice is up to you. But I have made mine. Get inspired and save a lot of money by buying this one!	2001-11-09

Well,when I was 14-15 years old,I was mostly interested in underwater photography and therefore,I had only a few photo books. But later,my interest for other animals too,grew much larger and therefore,I received this book as a christmas gift from my mother. It was really not a bad book,and it made me love Lanting and buy two more books with his pictures later.<BR>It is a huge book,weighing perhaps 1,5 kilograms and with dimensions \\"14\\" x \\"10\\". It contains 150 photographs of plants and animals living in jungles around the world. Among the animals included are a series of pictures of red macaws in Peru,<BR>dancing lemurs of Madagascar,cute little frogs in giant flowers in Borneo,incredibly strang-looking insects of various jungles,bats fishing at night in South America,and the shining eyes of caimans in Brazil. <BR>But don`t just look at the animal pictures. The part which I find most inspiring is the jungle habitats. Especially the morning light in Borneo and Peru,and the palm savannah of Brazil. They all look humid and there are fog clouds in the dawin. Very beautifull. The australian jungles look very exciting too. Many pictures,especially of birds,are very windy to make a real impression of the movements of the animals. Lanting`s capability of capturing details of animals has never been as well presented as in this book. Especially in this huge format and double-page photos in the half of the book. <BR>Over all,this is a fantastic book recommended to anyone interested in jungles,animals,or just in beautifull natural photography. You`ll be amazed,whoever you are.	2001-11-09

There has been books before where humans and dinosaurs meet,but no one as special as this one. <BR>What would the world have looked like if the dinosaurs were still alive? <BR>Would we have used Brontosaurus as a beast of burden?<BR>The little 5-foot long Protoceratops as a pet?<BR>Or T-rex as the main attraction on zoos?<BR>It is always an interesting thought. Some of the dinosaurs does not just seem to be like pets or beasts of burden for the humans,they are often very helpfull and intelligent beeings. Even the nasty Velociraptor can be domesticated here.<BR>Well,I`ll give you a short description of the plot here: <BR>Arthur Denison and his son Will are stranded on a mysterious island in the late 19th century. They find a little,strange animal (which later appears to be a protoceratops)which have been hurt. When they approach it,they are suddenly surrounded by gigantic creatures of many shapes and colors - DINOSAURS!<BR>And then,a human appears to calm down the animals. They are now taken to a house were normal people live. <BR>Then,they experience different adventures on the island,among them a flight in the mountains on giant pterosaurs,here called &quot;dragons&quot;,a ride on giant ostrich dinosaurs,and a confrontation with Tyrannosaurus rex!<BR>Over all,my thoughts about this book is that it is very great. The illustrations are of high quality and invalueable to the ones that likes dinosaurs. I am currently writing a story named &quot;The Forgotten Island&quot;,were an expedition are sent to explore an island were dinosaurs are still alive. That story is quite inspired by this one,although the dinosaurs are not accompanied by humans in my story. I especially like the fact that he has included many not so well known dinosaurs in Dinotopia - for example the enormous ostrich dinosaur with 8-foot arms named Deinocheirus. Or the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus. <BR>Over all,this is a great book that receives all appreciation it can get as a wonderfull fantasy adventure. <BR>I have heard that it is going to be visualized into a massive TV movie in the year of 2002 - over six hours!It will be really interesting to see what it looks like. As James Gurney has been their concept artist,I don`t think it`ll bee bad. I am currently looking a lot forward to it. While waiting,don`t forget to read the book.	2001-10-25

Well,I can say that this is an over all excellent dog book. <BR>It is from TFH Publishing,which makes many good pet books.<BR>The book contains over 1200 color photographs of 400 dog breeds. <BR>It often has many photos of the same breed,to show different color variations,as the case with the english buldog for example. <BR>This isn`t just the simple dog guide you`re reading when you`re going to bed. This book is of molossus proportions,weighing 3 pounds!There are some breeds that can be found here which cannot be found in any other dog book,but there are also some breeds missing here - the Cane Corso for example. <BR>Although I do not own any dog myself,I like them. And there is alot of usefull information on dog breeds. For example their <BR>dimensions in inches &amp; weight,typical behavior,suitability with children,country of origin,and much more. <BR>But there are still some negative comments I have about this book. And the first is : there are some breeds treated here that are extinct (take the American Hairless Terrier for example)and therefore,the information on them is out of date. <BR>The second errors are in the classification of breed groups. For example,the pyrenean dog is classified as a mastiff - it should be among the shepherd dogs. Mastiffs are the more bulldog like dogs,as the English Buldog. And the pitbull terrier should be classified as a terrier,not as a mastiff. <BR>And yet,the book is a little pricy. It wasn`t really worth that much. Therefore,I would mostly like to recommend it to the real dog enthusiast,that can`t get enough of them. If you are one of those,then take it. If you want a cheaper guide,then Bruce Fogle`s &quot;Dog Encyclopedia&quot; is strongly recommended.	2001-10-12

This is definitly a treasure for anyone interested in fishes!<BR>Although I know it is just a fish ID book in the same series as the other four books I own,it is more entertaining than those. <BR>May be because it has many picture stories about fish behaviour. <BR>Or may be because I love the fish species covered in this guide.<BR>Although the author is known for taking adventurous dive trips in Indonesia or Red Sea,this is the area which he really belongs to!He took his first dive plunges in the Mediterranean,and it is probably a good place for beginners to dive.<BR>Strangely enough,the shark section of this book is rather large,covering 70 pages (compared to 20 in most other of Debelius` books),although there are not more species in the Atlantic than in the Indian Ocean. When I bought it,it quickly became my favourite fish book. It can be usefull here in Sweden,where I live,as well as in the Mediterranean and even in South Africa,and many fishes that lives here are also living the Western Atlantic,so it can be usefull in the Caribbean too!<BR>Many species covered where also new to me when I read this book. You don`t usually think about the Atlantic as such a diverse area. Over 500 species are covered here,many of them given special attention. Of course,everyone knows what a perch or cod is,but how many people knows what a senegal goby or a beautifull blackear moray is? <BR>Dive in,and get your own fish experiences!	2001-09-30

Hawaii isn`t just big waves or sunny beaches. <BR>For a fish enthusiast,it is a heaven of beautifull animals. <BR>And this book is very helpfull when knowing what animals that hides beneath the surface of the ocean. <BR>Practically every habitat is invaded by creatures creeping,floating,crawling or swimming.<BR>Over 500 species are identified here. Scientific &amp; common names,natural history,size,cultural importance,ecology and suitability for aquariums - everything can be found here!<BR>The habitats are also presented,before the ID section begins. <BR>The book begins with a chapter about sponges,which are not as diverse here as in many other areas,but nevertheless,they are very colorfull. Then,we will see some jellyfish in the next chapter. My favourite is the white-spotted one. We also have Hawaii`s corals here. They are not well-known and not so colorfull as their relatives in the Indian Ocean,but it is good to know their names. The anemones are also quite anonymous,but very colorfull. After the huge coral chapter,the worms are presented,both the bristleworms and the nudibranch-like flatworms. The latter are the most beautifull creatures of the reef,with all of their colors,but not the cutest. The worm chapter is rather small,but the next chapter is covering the molluscs. They are very diverse,with more than 110 000 species worldwide. Both clams,shells,nudibranchs (=sea snails)and octopuses are presented here. The cowries are famous here,and I can`t understand why their shells are so famous - it is the living animals that covers the shell that are really amazing!Other shells included here are the venomous cone shells,the huge triton and many more. The nudibranchs should not be forgotten either. Their colors and shapes are endless in variations and beauty. Black,white,green,yellow,purple,pink - every color exists!They are even beating the fishes in beauty. The octopuses,of which only 8 species are presented,are rather similar to each other,so it`s not much to say about them. Then,I jump to the second of the book`s big chapters - about the Crustaceans. The crustaceans are my favourite invertebrates and therefore,this section is very interesting. Many rare species of reef crabs,lobsters,shrimps,mantis shrimps and unusually colorfull hermit crabs are presented here. My favorite is the rock lobster. The last chapter treats the echinoderms,which are highly developed although they lack head!The seastars,sea cucumbers,urchins and featherstars are included here. <br />After you`ve seen that chapter,the wonderfull book is over!<BR>And it has been really great. <BR>REMEMBER: This is just what I have told you!Now it`s your turn to dive in and get your own invertebrate knowledge!	2001-09-30

When I first received this book as a christmas gift from my mother,I was shocked. It was spiral bound,but twice the size of a norma fish identification guide. At 424 pages &amp; 670 photos,it is rather spectacular. Although I have only seen it in pictures,the west atlantic is my favourite underwater landscape,and therefore,it was a great honour to own this book. <BR>The book begins with an introduction to fishes in the caribbean and the ecology of the reefs. A massive ID book is needed to identify fishes on the world`s second largest reef area. <BR>Different from most other fish ID books,it is a rather special one that is dividing the fish into groups based on look rather than relationship. I`ll go through these groups one by one in this review.  <BR>ID group 1 is Disks/Oval,featuring some of my favourite fish,making a perfect beginning of the book.<BR>Butterflyfish,angelfish,and surgeonfish can be found here. <BR>Every description includes a short description of colors and gender differences,if any,distribution,family,size,depht and reaction to divers,and natural habitat. <BR>The photographs are accompanied by b/w drawings of the silhouettes.<BR>The second one is a rather large chapter,covering the silvery,stream-lined ocean hunters like barracudas,porgies,mojarras,dolphins,mullets,and the large predator cobia. Not very colorfull,but still majestic.<BR>The 3rd chapter includes Sloping Head/Tapered body,with snappers and grunts as the main families.The grunts can be rather varied. <BR>The 4th one includes Small Ovals,where the damselfish and chromis can be found. There are no anemonefish in the caribbean,but these are closely related to those. Also included here are the hamlets,which are all subspecies of one species.<BR>These are very colorfull and cute little critters. The next chapter is Heavy Body/Large Lips,including the largest bony fishes here - groupers,of which the jewfish can weigh 900 pounds!<BR>These are clumsy,but still charmy fishes. Except 30 speciesof those,the little fairy basslet,the most beautifull fish of the caribbean,is included here too,yellow and purple. <BR>Swim with Pectoral Fins,which is ID group 6,includes the varied family of parrotfishes and wrasses,which are very colourfull. The Hogfish can also be found here,the character of the caribbean. ID group 7 introduces Reddish/Big Eyes,with the big-eyed squirrelfishes and the small,but beautifull cardinalfish. <BR>ID group 8 treats the Small,Elongated Bottom-Dwellers,whose beauty is often underestimated,especially the cute gobies. The sailfin blenny is one of my favourites. Here,we can also find the yellowhead jawfish,which is a famous fish here too. Odd-Shaped Bottom Dwellers includes the toadfish and the funny-looking flounders &amp; batfishes,who walks on their fins!I am very fascinated by the looks of the strange frogfishes. Odd-Shaped Swimmers (chapter 10) includes the pufferfish,which can fill themselves with air,and the funny-looking trumpetfish. Also found here are the boxfishes,who are covered with armor,except for their fins,eyes and mouth. They can have very beautifull colors. The triggerfish can be found too. They are colorfull,although agressive inhabitants of the coral reefs. So are their close relatives,the filefishes. <BR>And finally,the cutest fish in the Caribbean,can also be found here. It is the little yellow porcupinefish,less than an inch in size. The famous jack-knife is also found in this chapter. It looks like a cross between a scalare and a chromis!<BR>It is believed to be the juvenile form of the web burrfish.<BR>The 11th chapter is the Eel Deal of the book. Here comes the snake eels,beautifull but mysterious bottom dwellers. And last,but not least,the venomous moray eels also lurks in this chapter. The 8-foot green moray is the most famous,while the most scary one is the viper moray with huge teeth!I love moray eels,so this is a paradise for me!<BR>The final chapter &quot;Sharks &amp; Rays&quot; deals with the ultimate UW predators. But not all sharks a fierce. In fact,the whale shark is one of the friendliest fishes in the world,reaching a size of 60 feet and harmless to everything but plancton!The nurse shark is also a character of the Caribbean. Other ones included here are the manta ray,lemon shark,mako shark (the fastest fish in the world)and the dangerous tiger &amp; bull sharks.<BR>This is a chapter I would have liked to expand a bit,but as many sharks are not reef dwellers,I understand why they did not included the great white and/or the Megamouth. <BR>Over all,now I have gone through all chapters fastly,but you have to see this book to really enjoy it. When I go to the Caribbean or Florida,I will bring this book and see how many fish I can identify. <BR>So go get it!	2001-09-29

Well,I own the german original edition of this book,which I got before it was released in english,but it`s the same book. I can still read some german - it`s an easy language to understand. <BR>Anyway,I prefer to write a review in english. <BR>When I got the first book about two or three years ago,I thought there was something missing. There was only fishes of the order Perciformes,and the only invertebrates included were crustaceans and some anemones. I thought that was very strange. As there was some trouble when making this massive seven-book series,the second volume should have included other fish,but instead,here comes the missed invertebrates. It begins with a lot of sponges. <BR>Although care advices are beeing given,sponges are NOT recommended as aquarium animals,due to their feeding habits. Therefore,all of them has a high difficult grade. But if you shall go diving in the caribbean or something,it could be valueable as a marine life identification guide. <BR>The next chapter are treating the missing cnidarians from the first book,with stony corals and soft corals,and even some jellyfish!This section is taking up almost the half of the book,but as the corals is a rather dominating group of marine animals,that is completley understandable. Practical advice are beeing given for all of them. After reading it,I would mostly recommend the leather corals as suitable aquarium animals. Forget the jellyfish. The stony corals often have beautifull shapes but they`re not very colourfull. After this huge chapter,the next animal group dealt with are the flatworms. We often think of worms as disgusting animals,but these are very beutifull,but difficult too keep in an aquarium as they eat sponges. They are often mistaken for sea snails,but they have no gills on their back. Also included are the comb jellyfishes,a rare group of pelagic sea animals related to jellyfishes.<BR>The final chapter are dealing with the molluscs,a very diverse group of marine animals. Here,we cansee mostly shells of different kinds,and they are very beautifull and varied. Especially the small,but incredible section for nudibranchs. Some of these shells,altough not the cowries,can be kept in a marine aquarium very easily. So far,this book has been a valueable resource for me,as it has so many species included. Do not forget to buy the first and third volume,while volume 4-7 are additional species introduced. I do not own volume 5,but I`ll get that some time too.

When I saw this book in a local store,I bough it immidiatley. <BR>It was so great that I have no other book of such beauty. <BR>Although I know that this is a diving guide and not an overblown photo book,I bought it mostly for the images.<BR>It is done in a very aesthetic way,accompanied by some short facts about the animals and where they usually live. Although not as species-rich as some other seas of the world,The Caribbean is a very fascinating area with all of it`s shapes in the reefs. There are even some &quot;personalities&quot; among the fishes. <BR>The photographs are capturing both cuteness and humour,majestic reefscapes,and just sheer beauty,like the stingrays. <BR>The Caribbean is definitley a very colourfull marine area,and the largest coral reef of the northern half of the world. <BR>Although I do not dive myself,I find this book very helpfull,because it is telling you about the temperature of water and air,when to go,special interests,etc.<BR>And,as a sample from the book,here are the ten golden rules for Diving: <br />*Avoid touching coral with your hands,fins,tanks,etc. <br />*Do not wear gloves<br />*Never stand on coral<br />*Do NOT collect any marine life<br />*Avoid overweighting and work on your buoyancy control<br />*Do not feed fish alien foods<br />*Make sure your equipment consoles to not drag the coral<br />*Do not use spear guns<br />*Do not molest marine life<br />*Do not climb inside barrel sponges<br />*Through your reactions,consider your impact on aquatic life<br />*Report any environmental disturbances of destructions of any divesite<BR>So,that is why I like this book so much. It combines the practical elements with the artistic.<BR>To the ones interested in diving,buy it for the facts.<BR>They are certainly good to know.  <BR>To naturalists,buy it for the photographs. They are quite inspiring and attempting. Among my favorites are giant sponges,<BR>stingrays,groupers,moray eels,and anemones. <BR>Now,dive in and get your own marinelife adventure!	2001-09-23

It features parts of the Lanzendorf Collection,which is the largest dinosaur art collection in the world. This 160-page book features about 20 per cent of the collection,but it is still amazingly much. Of course,it would be impossible to collect all dinosaur art beeing made today,but if anyone did,John Lanzendorf would be the one to do it. His apartment contains only dinosaur collectibles and artwork - no other decorations!That must be a really amazing home to live in!<BR>With this book,I have the option to view some of the work hanging there. Although this book has some pictures of beautifull,triassic dinosaurs and jurassic ones as well,it focuses mainly on the cretaceous period,which is called &quot;A Cretaceous End to A Lost World&quot;. And that is may be because most of the really fantastic dinosaurs lived during the mid-late cretaceous. There are a lot of pictures of T-rex,which is particulary my favorite dinosaur,and the most inspiring one in this book. Some of the other amazing dinosaurs featured here are Sinsauropteryx,Carnotaurus,Lambeosaurus,and many more.<BR>It does have some inspiring,peacefull pictures of plant-eaters,although the pictures of theropods are the highlights. <BR>Each artist has their own,unique style. John Sibbick has an immidiate sense of detail,and is one of the best. Luis Rey has a little sense of surrealism in his detailed,a little strange paintings. Mark Hallet has the classical style in dinosaur painting. John Bindon is the master of black/white dinosaur art.<BR>Donna Braginetz always make it feel so real you believe they are really there!<BR>Of course,the bronze sculptures makes a nice addition to the artwork,and they look very real. Must be nice decorations!<BR>Over all,the combination of the artists`s different talents makes this book a wonderfull coffee-table book,and a unique collection of dinosaur art that should be a part of every paleontologist`s or dinosaur maniac`s library. I know it is quite expensive,but believe me,it`s worth every penny you spend on it!It has been very helpfull to me when learning to paint good dinosaurs,and the different talents makes me take little inspiration from every painting in the book.<BR>So,if you like dinosaurs seriously,this is a must-have!No dinosaur artist should be without a copy of this book.	2001-08-16
US	45897246	R28OQ50783FSFI	0967591805	525025665	The Living Wild	Books	5	11	12	N	N	Magnificent photographs and call for help to text!	I had heard of Mr. Wolfe before,but it wasn`t until today,when I got this book I saw his photographs. I definitly think he is comparable with my other favourites Lanting and Doubilet,if not better. This book is definitly not a small bad book! At a weight of more than 2 pounds and in a format not suitable for even my bookcase,it is a behemoth in nature photo books. It was pretty expensive,but belive me,it`s worth the money. The book is divided into seven chapters,after the beautifull introduction. Island and Ocean is the first,and it deals with the Galapagos Islands with fantastic iguanas,and also humpback whales,which are very impressive. Polar &amp; Subpolar,which is the second chapter,deals with cute polar bears and elephant seals that looks pretty fun,but also penguins,which are charmy animals. Savannah,Desert &amp; Steppe is also an impressive chapter that features lions,wild dogs and elephants of the african savannah. Here are also some funny australian lizards,among them a moloch which looks like an alien!Mountain is the fourth chapterm,and it has many beautifull views of animals with mountains in the background - perfect inspiration. Temperate shows the beauty of North America`s nature with bears,owls and wolves. Subtropical features the Indian Nature. Here there are an excellent picture of mating peacocks. The tiger enthusiast won`t be disappointed either. The final chapter deals with the tropical rainforests,the most diverse areas in the world. Many wild cats are included here,but also toucans and parrots,to not mention monkeys. Over all,I can almost classify this as a sequel to Lanting`s The Living Planet,but in new format and a new photographer. This is a real mammoth release that won`t make anyone disappointed. It also has interesting comments about the endangered species by different authors. I find it very inspiring and funny to look at. Everyone that sees it says:&quot;Can I look!&quot;. In such huge format,the full beauty of the image can be discovered. Every picture is like a poster!The book features a total of 150 species from 40 countries. Together with &quot;The Living Planet&quot; and &quot;Water Light Time&quot; it is the best photo book I have read so far. If Wolfe continues like this,I am pleased to see his future work.	2001-06-16

The Dinosaur film was by me rated as the perfect special effects movie in the year 2000. So was this book,but instead the perfect art book. Well,I was actually hoping for an &quot;Art of&quot; book with this film like the ones with Tarzan and Mulan. This is more &quot;Making of&quot; but it is pretty good too. I actually bought this book before I saw the film and it was incredible. When I saw it in my local bookstore,I immidiatley laid my hands on it and bought it although the high price. It was definitly worth it! I own some good making of and behind the scenes books for films like Star Wars and Alien,but none of them challenges this in beauty or inspiration. The first section is a perfect introduction to the film. The following,which is my favourite,is filled with concept art and amazingly detailed visual production paintings. Many of the habitats in those are actually much more interesting than the desert landscapes of the movie. The images of the carnotaurs quickly made it to my favourite dinosaurian monster in any film - it makes JP`s T-rex look like an innoncent domestic cat while the carnotaur has the look of a reptile pitbull terrier!The iguanodon drawings are also of high quality to not mention the ankylosaur - it looks exactly like a real Talarurus. Well,now you will know the rest when buying it.   This book is classified as &quot;Movie Book&quot;but I think it can be used as a paleontology book too. Although it is about a film,the dinosaurs look so real that it is probably an amount of art work for the dinosaur illustrator as well. I find many paintings I get inspired by when looking at this book. It is a must-have for anyone seriously interested in CG features and dinosaur artwork. Buy it!	2001-05-10

This oversized,full-colour artbook is amazing!It covers all the most extreme dinosaurs and some others too. Finally,we have an updated dinosaur records book. I can give a presentation of it here : the first chapter covers the biggest sauropods (Brachiosaurus and Seismosaurus) and the second chapter has the biggest meat-eaters (T-rex and Giganotosaurus).The third has the raptors,as it treats the most dangerous dinos,and the fourth chapter covers the strangest,such as the 3-foot clawed Therizinosaur and the crested Parasaurolophus. The fourth one covers the spiky armored ones and the next covers the fastest,like Struthiomimus. The last two covers the first dinosaus discovered and the latest ones,like Iguanodon and Cryolophosaurus. The paintings are so inspiring and beautifull that they cannot be described in words. It really gives me inspiration to my own drawings and I imagine the pictures and video caps from a movie screen from a film I wish existed and I would create. I am surprised the price was so low. Normally,I can expect a price of [...] or more. It is now your decision to chose if you want to spend [...] for Dinosaur Imagery or just [...] for this!I have done mine. I get a lot of inspiration and save a lot of money. It is definitly worth the price,only for the paintings.	2001-05-09

A Good Reference for Australia`s Temperate Waters	Australias marine life is known world wide for it`s great diversity on the barrier reef. But how many knows that a colourfull fauna also exists in the temperate waters of the south. When I bought this book,many species were new to me,something that made it very interesting. It is a huge book of more than 500 pages and 1200 photographs,so it is detailed,but the photos are very beautifull. There is a detailed text about every species and all information you need to know is here. In this book you`ll find everything from small algae to great white sharks. The fishes are amazingly colourfull,and so are the invertebrates. It is also pretty cheap (I bought it in London for  25.95. )for beeing so detailed and rich of information. If you want to see some new species and are tired of all the tropical,try this. I`m sure no one will read this book without learning something new. A real treasure.	2001-05-04

I think this is one of the best books on tropical reef fishes ever written. When I received this book on the holidays,I was incredibly happy. Even though I recognized many of the species,there was some new and many new views of species I`d already knew. It covers all kinds of fish,from sharks to anemonfishes. And the colour of them are the most striking I`ve ever seen on animals.  My favorite chapter is probably the first one,about sharks &amp; rays. In second to it,there are the Scorpionfish and the Moray Eel chapter,although the angelfishes are the most beautifull fishes,the sharks are the coolest and most fascinating.  At all,I will give it an high rate and I am a great fan of the author,Helmut Debelius,who has made many other great fish books which I also own,but this one is the best! But I would like if it was a little bit longer (a book of 450 pages would have been good)and have covered a little more about the behaviour of the fishes,and their reaction to divers,showing additional photos.	2001-01-06
