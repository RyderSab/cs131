There will never be justice for the victims, survivors and their families - books like this offer some explanation for the betrayal and crimes.	2003-10-09

Read the book to find out why.  As for David herself, a graphologist summed her up when she was 17 - &quot;she does not shine, she absorbs&quot;.  A taker, not a giver in other words, and this book certainly does not contain any examples of her alleged charm.	2002-11-26

A relentless page turner with Lord Peter Wimsey as cool, complicated and surprising as ever (the cricket game is an absolute classic).  A teaser mention of Harriett as she doesn't make an appearance in this book.  There is a slight lull around chapter 10 but another cracking read regardless!!	2002-06-30

And how people adapted to it.  The mother-son relationship is particularly affecting (although his father seems to be made of cardboard - but this could be a reflection of the gulf between the old and young men). A damning indictment of the propaganda of war. By the end, this young man is another victim of war - destroyed in his soul, heart, mind and finally his body.  A very emotional story.  I lived every moment and was consumed with grief.  Why do we let the same thing happen over and over again???????	2001-11-07

The power struggles, invasions, wars and alliances are a fascinating tapestry.  It isn't about &quot;great men&quot;, it's about people with flaws and obsessions, sometimes visions.  The time before reason, when (sometimes) faith meant everything.  An exhilarating, thoughtful and entertaining adventure.  Thank you, Mr Schama!	2001-11-05

He was vain and greedy. He was particularly irksome to both wives (secret and catholic Mrs Fitzherbert, &quot;respectable&quot; but dizzy Princess Caroline).  But no-one is all bad - he loved his daughter, enjoyed parties and built a few memorable buildings.  What a waste of a life.  Despite the horrible cover, this is a solid book on the Prince Regent which will be read (or glanced at) by regency buffs the world over.	2001-11-05

But much like the swan, it's what happening underneath that's important.  I have always admired this book for its wit and sharp observations but also for the title.  Clever and astute, as usual.  But is it Elizabeth who is proud and Darcy who is prejudiced?  Or vice versa?  Or are they both proud and prejudiced?  These questions keep me re-reading this masterpiece at least once a year and I change my mind about the answers every time. This book will give me a lifetime of pleasure.	2001-11-03

David Howarth based this book on a kaleidoscope of 18 eye-witness accounts which explains its freshness. Who could not be moved by the fate of the newlyweds, Sir William &amp; Lady de Lancey? Or angered by the Prince of Orange for his arrogance and stupidity? And how is it possible not to be fascinated by Lord Uxbridge's gruesome operation to ampute his leg?<br />It is a book as relevant today as it ever was for the question David Howarth posed in his introduction &quot;what makes a man, who joins an army and puts on a more or less exotic kind of dress, behave on the word of command entirely unlike himself, but like a ferocious animal?&quot;	2001-11-03
