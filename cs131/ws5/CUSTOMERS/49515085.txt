And while this is a great book, it does not hold a candle to Adams.<br /><br />I will say it again, though ... \\"Good Omens\\" is a great read. It captures a fine blend of seriousness and laugh-out-loud situations. There are so many great quirks, from a demon who has come to love the Earth a little too much, to prophet Agnes Nutter's offbeat (and mostly accurate) foretellings, you'll find yourself laughing a lot. And it has the best ending to ANY book I have EVER read. Hands down outstanding on the end.<br /><br />A few minor quibbles, such as a few mishandled characters and some muddling of the plot at times. It's nothing that should keep you from reading this book, however. If you like Science Fiction or Comedies, this is a wonderful mix of both genres.	2005-08-05

Actually, EVERYONE has an annoying knack to launch into extended observations that serve nothing more than to show off the authors' knowledge.<br /><br />\\"Say, isn't that the Piazza de Tribiani, Pendergrast?\\"<br /><br />\\"Why yes, my dear D'Agosta, let me tell you eighteen interesting facts about it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wow, that's neat. Does it have anything to do with us?\\"<br /><br />\\"Nope ... we're just driving by it.\\"<br /><br />Pendergrast is by far the most annoying. I guess he is supposed to be a riveting character because he is mysterious, but he comes off as a pompous synonym-for-mule. He just happens to be impossibly intelligent and even more impossibly rich. To complete his unrealistic portrait, he is an FBI agent with absolutely no supervision and even less accountability.<br /><br />Maybe this seems more like a personal pet peeve of mine than an actual flaw of the story, but I do think these elements drag down the plot. And stripped of these un-needed sidebars, the plot is actually pretty good. I'm ashamed to say, I'll probably pick up \\"Dance Of Death\\" just because I can't stand cliffhangars. Aaaarrrrgh!	2005-07-13

Quirky characters really catch the essence of East Tennessee. The cover promises work on par with Mark Twain or John Kennedy Toole (A Confederacy of Dunces). The book didn't deliver on this high promise, but it does sort of read like \\"A Confederacy Of Dunces\\" kid brother.<br /><br />We follow John Tolley from New York to the wilds of Pantherville, a \\"blink-and-you-miss-it\\" town in Eastern Tennessee. He is a misguided, if optimistic, historian in search of an Andrew Johnson scrapbook that may or may not exist. Along the way, he meets a collage of offbeat citizens, including Dweena, a post-office worker, her cousin who trains coon dogs, and a snobby New York t.v. producer looking for a scoop on a mysterious infant rash.<br /><br />If you care about the Volunteer State or enjoy light-hearted farces, this may be an excellent read for you. Expect to get pelted with a lot of mostly useless Tennessee trivia. The dialogue also reads uneven (realistic dialogue is a longstanding pet peeve of mine). Otherwise, good on author James Whorton. He put together a fine piece of work.	2004-12-27

It's where the woman was killed and her baby was stolen from her womb.<br /><br />But Skidmore got its notoriety in the 1980s when a man was killed in front of a group of people. \\"In Broad Daylight\\" details that story in its chilling entirety. Probably not since the West Memphis Three has there been a crime involving ordinary citizens so compelling. It lacks all the glitz and glamor of the OJ or Robert Blake cases, but I think it has so much more to say. A great study in vigilante justice.	2004-12-21

Hiaason is an easy-going storyteller with a healthy streak of black humor, so I would call this a page-turner. This book would've been great if not for two major distractions:<br /><br />1. Present Tense. Most novels are written in past tense, and to hear Jack Tagger go \\"She says such-and-such and I walk out of the room\\" constantly took me out of the story. In my opinion, writing a novel in present tense should be a no-go.<br /><br />2. Unbelievable Characters. Emma has no cause to fall for Jack. What Jack did would've gotten him fired, not demoted to obits. Nearly none of Jack's obits are fit to print (speaking here as an ex-newspaper employee myself). The Slut Puppies would've never gone platinum and won multiple Grammys. A plot twist near the end involving Jimmy Stroma's body never could've happened in real life.<br /><br />Like I said, it's an enjoyable read that is hampered by some style problems. Guess I'll have to read \\"Sick Puppy\\" before I totally write off Hiaason as a low-rent Elmore Leonard.	2004-11-04
US	49515085	RSO8J41GAU7I8	0812570065	246060029	Gray Matter	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Meh.	I guess one of my biggest pet peeves is when authors have a great idea and fail to capitalize on it. Here we have a compelling subject -- raising IQ (but maybe not legally). But the author would rather drown this great idea with a bunch of hokey plot \\"twists\\" and cartoonish characters. Perfect example are two of the children. Dylan, the one who needs an IQ boost, is the sweetest, sweetest boy ever. He can do no wrong. His foil, Lucinda, is quite the opposite, evil incarnate. For cheap shock value, she does something very bad to her new pet kitty.<br /><br />Characters' motivation or logic is never clearly understood. Rachel, the protagonist, must hide her intentions from her husband. Why? She says she fears it is her fault Dylan isn't so bright. But that fact alone barely covers the tremendous lengths she goes to deceive. And Dr. Malenko? Yeah, I understand what he is doing is profitable, but after dozens of children have disappeared and dozens of the newly \\"smarter\\" kids turn out severely disturbed, how is he still in operation?<br /><br />\\"Gray Matter\\" is mostly a ridiculous read salted with a few genuinely tense and moving moments. Braver is okay, but in no position to unseat Robin Cook as the king of medical thrillers.	2004-10-25

But I think the idea ended up being better than the execution here ... the collection sits a bit lacking.<br /><br />I think the problem is in the editors' lack of understanding the difference between \\"terror\\" and \\"shock value.\\" A lot of these stories are shocking, but few really get into your head. And the most tiresome \\"shock du jour\\" appears to be child molestation. The story \\"Father Bob And Bobby\\" is a nice example of this -- he traded in genuine horror for a cheap shock and gross-out factor. At least four other stories try and weave in child abuse into their tales.<br /><br />Even the Stephen King plot was flat, although I always enjoy his writing style and cadance so it was still an enjoyable read. I also think \\"Smooth Operator\\" (Dominick Cancilla), \\"Rami Temporalis\\" (Gary Braunbeck) and \\"All Hands\\" (John Platt) were quite excellent. But there are 10-15 stories in here that I think don't work for various reasons. A handful of 5-star efforts sprinkled among the 2-star fodder makes it a 3-star book overall.	2004-10-21

I first heard of this book through [...] The randomness and unintentional comedy carries tremendous appeal.<br /><br />The author, with the help of a volunteer army of trash hunters, find the treasure of others' trash. My personal favorite was a sign that said simply \\"Steve\\" with a bunch of vertical tearaway \\"Steve\\"s on the bottom. (Done in the style of a laundrymat ad.) Others have found evidence of epic battles, heartwrenching breakups and untold mysteries. The greatest outcome -- you begin to wonder who these people are, what context the note was in, and how their various conflicts have since resolved. The imagination runs wild with the possibilities. In that way, the book almost functions as one of those \\"Choose Your Own Adventure\\" books, with you the reader filling in the empty spaces.<br /><br />A great \\"find,\\" pun definitely intended.	2004-10-01

I found the book to be a little of a letdown in one respect. The fact that I'm reading a book about hiking the AT, and the guy only hikes 500 out of the 2,100 miles, that's a bit misleading to me. It sours his first-hand authority as a &quot;thru-hiker,&quot; in my opinion.<br />Now, the good. He makes up for this offense, and then some, with a witty and charming tale of the trials and tribulations of tackling such a large project. He's done his research well. I came away more informed about various aspects of the trail (the equipment, the environment, the history, the hikers), and a few genuine belly laughs, to boot. The scene when Katz (his hiking partner) greets him at the airport tipping the scales at 300 lbs., clutching a donut, should go down as a classic moment in nonfiction.<br />And despite all his bellyaching about bears, blisters, yuppie weekend hikers, etc., I was inspired to make more time for hiking. Very inspiring in places. All in all, a worthwhile read. For five-star travel fiction, please consider &quot;Blue Highways&quot; by William Least-Heat Moon.	2003-07-17

The journalists selected are not particuarly well-known, but they are masters of their craft and present highly enjoyable reads. Susan Orlean might be the best-known of the bunch, just because her most recent book, &quot;The Orchid Thief,&quot; was highlighted in the 2002 movie &quot;Adaptation.&quot;<br />For starters, Orlean's piece &quot;The American Male at Age 10&quot; was a fascinating look at today's youth. Each piece is outstanding in its own way, but may I also present as standouts &quot;TV Without Guilt&quot; (a family whose television is on approximately 16 hours a day) and &quot;The Man Who Couldn't Read&quot; (profile of an illiterate millionaire with two college degrees).<br />As a bonus for those with an interest in feature writing, &quot;Author's Afterwords&quot; has the writers briefly describe the process of finding and executing their ideas.

With the second &quot;Viv Powers&quot; mystery out and a third due in 2004, author Letha Albright has a bona fide SERIES on her hands. And what's the most important thing in a series? The lead character, of course.<br />And heroine Viv Powers has character in spades. She's passionate, intelligent, wry... and very good at being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Her day job is writing for a regional magazine, but she picks up a new night job -- sleuthing -- when a land dispute leaves two people dead. Who's to blame? The men who want to open a racetrack in Talequah? Any one of several townspeople, all of whom seem to have motive? Or even Utlunta, a Cherokee legend that might actually exist? Albright keeps the reader guessing until the very end.<br />The book starts off a tad slow, but the second half runs at a full gallop until the conclusion. There also seems to be a love-triangle-in-the-making: Viv is going to have to choose between her current boyfriend (Charley, a musician) and an ex-lover (Hutch, a detective). Too many peripheral characters  clutter the pace at times, but it's otherwise a twisting, turning gem of a mystery. The plotline dealing with Utlunta, a Cherokee witch with a deadly stone finger, makes for truly chilling moments.<br />Pick up Albright's debut, &quot;Tulsa Time,&quot; then read &quot;Daredevil's Apprentice,&quot; then wait in line like the rest of us for more Viv Powers books. If you live in Tulsa or Talequa, Oklahoma, there's extra incentive to read these books, as Albright does an excellent job describing these locales.	2003-07-14

All in all, this book was easily digestable, and more importantly, very useful for those who want to experiment with  biographical or memoir writings. Although the book is short and sweet, it also points to many other books (Bird By Bird, Writing Down The Bones, Autobiography of a Face, dozens more) that both legitimize the book and offer further reading.<br />The topics were thorough without bogging down the book: You will get valuable tips on how to describe things with all five senses, how to write scenes, how to move around on a timeline, how to tie your writing into &quot;the bigger picture&quot; and so on. There are also ethical and legal topics Barrington touches upon: when to use names, what constitutes libel, what to consider if you're writing about living people, etc.<br />Moreover, there are several writing exercises at the end of each chapter to help you develop ideas. The exercises are nice because they make the book flexible. If you don't do the exercises, you could read the book in about 2-4 sittings and get a good overview of the memoir. If you invested the extra time to do the exercises, you would be able to hone your craft to a much greater degree. It's really up to the reader...	2002-09-19

Yes, it's long, but I, for one, found it strangely absorbing.<br />Do not be afraid of long books. Wolfe engages in an impressive cast of characters and takes time to develop many of them. His narrative flow is superb. I enjoyed not only the plot and the characters, but the writing style as well. The author has a certain way with the English language that is captivating, and concepts like \\"boys with breasts\\" (aka today's skin-n-bones models), \\"saddlebags\\" and \\"hubba ho\\" can be both though-provoking and laugh-out-loud funny. Wolfe has a unique sense of humor, considering he routinely does things off-beat like naming a black maid \\"Auntie Bella\\" (antebellum?).<br />Wolfe seems to love his characters (even the unsympathetic ones) and takes readers along for a wild ride with characters like Roger Too White (a \\"beige brother\\" lawyer and Morehouse grad), Serena Crocker (a money-chasing second wife), Martha Crocker (a bitter first wife), Raymond Peepgrass (a money-chasing bank geek after the first wife), and Conrad Hensley (a bitter blue-collar worker reborn in prison). The antihero main character, however, will blow you away. Charlie Crocker is as much tall tale as real man. A real-estate giant in Atlanta, as well as an ex-football great, Charlie teeters on the brink of bankruptcy and personal ruin. At times like watching a train wreck, one never knows exactly what to think of Charlie -- he can be both sympathetic and unsympathetic to the extreme.<br />Wolfe seems to have a \\"take it or leave it\\" quirkiness that will engage some readers to the fullest and turn off others completely. Yes, you might have to sift through some of the author's annoying habits, like describing IN GREAT DETAIL every item of clothing every character is wearing at any given moment, but the experience of reading this book on the whole was very satisfying. I was left frustrated at the end, in fact, because I had no one to discuss the book with afterward. It really leaves a residue on the reader and begs to be thought of long after the last page has been turned.in fact, because I had no one to discuss the book with afterward.

First, the good: readability is very high... if you like to go to movies, watch tv, read books and the like, you very likely will be able to read most issues cover to cover. Solid front-of-book and back-of-book sections, interesting features, good mix of pop culture, it's all in here!<br />I would like to air two big grievences, however:<br />1. Stop sucking up to certain shows, please. If I have to hear any more about &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; I could scream. &quot;Buffy&quot; is a decent show at best that often has a molasses-slow plot, yet EW tends to rave on and on and on. You'll quickly find it annoying how they latch on to certain shows and never let go.<br />2. Be a kinder, gentler magazine. On the other hand, EW tends to be rather harsh at times, particularly on movie reviews. Good example is &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou,&quot; which I never thought was spectactular, but I'd personally give it a C+/B-, not the straight-out flunking it got in EW. It doles out what I believe to be more than its fair shares of D-minuses and F's.<br />I guess it all comes down this: While I find content to be outstanding, I also think EW could stand to be a bit more objective when it comes to reviews.	2001-12-10

Having come from Heat-Moon's neck of the woods (Columbia, Mo.), I find it interesting that the best work of journalism to come from my alma mater is not from the much-prided &quot;J&quot; school, but from an English department faculty member.<br />Heat-Moon takes an &quot;On The Road&quot; idea and turns it into something completely fresh and throroughly enjoyable. He has poured countless hours of research about where his travels took him, so ultimately, a reader can feel like he or she's been to the same place. That's power in writing.<br />The journey was a noble one, and Heat-Moon blends politics, journalism, theology and history into a narrative that is at times touching, other times poignant, but always interesting. Reading this book 20 pages at a time during lunch breaks made for a great trip in my mind. And though now 20 years old, many of the things Heat-Moon touched upon are ever-pressing issues in our society today. If it's not timeless, the book is darn close.<br />It much deserves the five stars I gave it, and it's a book I'll read again next year, this time armed with a pen so I can underline passages and make notes in the margins -- it's that useful and enjoyable!	2001-11-14

C.S. Lewis was exploring a similar theme a generation before that.<br />The simple plot: Screwtape, a demon, writes letters to his nephew, who is in charge of getting a man to fall from morality and trust in God. But the plot goes much, much deeper...<br />A real lesson you should take from the book is that damnation doesn't come all at once. Screwtape even says to his nephew that the best road to hell is a gradual, gently sloping one.<br />The book really opened my eyes on how I live my life. Even the smallest things I do in this world have consequence in the next. The book may not cause earth-shaking changes in your life, but reading this book definitely will make you think. And any book that does that is worth 1,000 times the cover price.<br />An interesting addition to this (and several other) version is a story Lewis wrote for the New Yorker more than a decade after &quot;Screwtape&quot; was first published. It serves as a wonderful epilouge to the tale, and I can only imagine the thrill of people who devoured the book when it first came out and then had to wait literally YEARS before they could get another small taste.	2001-09-19

I read a story in the paper recently that says the publisher is considering self-censorship -- taking out the Christian symbolism and market the books to sell like hotcakes (re: Harry Potter books).<br />Children have always loved fantasy books, it seems, and Harry Potter is continuing proof of that. But I and the generation before me grew up on the Narnia books, and I will always treasure first having it read to me, and later tackling it on my own.<br />The story is a great allegory of Christ and his resurrection, but it also teaches more universal morals (non-specific to Christians) such as the virtue of honesty, sacrifice, mercy, kindness and so on. As a journalist, I am prepared to fight even the snakiest and slimiest examples of the written word. Never did I imagine that I would ever have to defend such a wonderful book like this.<br />The book is decades old, but the characters are still fresh, the conflicts are still real, and the lessons are still applicable. It will be enjoyed by adults and children alike. Many Christians and non-Christians have and will continue to enjoy this book. And if you are a non-Christian who is so utterly distrubed by messages of peace and mercy, that's fine by me.

I will say, though, that everything wraps up nicely (although not to most readers' &quot;good triumphs evil completely&quot; expectations) in this third installment of Lord Of The Rings.<br />Don't read this book before reading the other two. That might go without saying, but don't even think about it. You will be lost.<br />Again, the book is rich with Tolkien's gorgeous prose. You'll probably never read prose so beautifully wrought by any modern writer out there. I think I will tackle the series a second time when I am older so I can read it aloud to my children.<br />I would say also that there are some nice spiritual undercurrents to this book that makes it fabulous from a moral perspective. You are not just reading a fairy tale, you are learning a bit about courage, duty, honesty and virtue. It's a big book to wrap your mind around, but congratulations to everyone who has journeyed through the first two books to Return Of The King. You won't be disappointed.	2001-07-18

But he isn't writing about bread, he's writing about war, something much more intense. I think he takes this difficult subject down some dark new paths. It's an atypical approach to a typical subject.<br />The part where the narrator considers running to Canada after he is drafted is one great instance of O'Brien's superior writing ability and approach. He is in a boat on a lake that borders Canada. He can go back to the States, or he can make a swim for it to &quot;freedom.&quot; He imagines nearly everyone he ever has known and what they would say.<br />The book was very touching, especially considering I was 19 (ripe draft age) when I read those words.

It seems that our new teachers aren't taught a lot about things like discipline or classroom organization in college. For those who think they might need a little extra help getting their classroom organized, I think that this book would make for a nice supplement.<br />The book details many helpful things:<br />1. Organizing your classroom based on the age of your students.<br />2. How to arrange desks, furniture, etc.<br />3. Making every bit of space in your classroom count.<br />4. Decorating, creating classroom displays, etc.<br />... and more.<br />The book is helpful without being condesending, and it has plenty of examples, tips and ideas.

No sleeping, no slowing down to go to the bathroom, nothing. Losers are shot, but the winner gets ANYTHING he wants. Care to gamble your life with 100-1 odds based on your sheer will and ability to walk hundreds of miles?<br />King's (er... Bachman's) pace is excellent, each character's story is interesting, but the greatest of all comes with imagining the rules and regulations and possibilities of this game. One of the networks actually picked up what sounds suspiciously like a VERY toned-down version of the game in the book. It has to do with walking or some other sort of endurance for a prize. Is it art imitating life or just plain creepy? Read this book and try and find a screening of an indie movie called &quot;Series 7&quot; (contestants each get a gun; the winner goes on to Series 8). They pack a serious 1-2 punch to the disturbing nature of reality shows.	2001-05-03

Interestingly enough, you could read this from start to end without having read The Hobbit or The Fellowship of the Ring, but why would you want to?<br />The Two Towers is a bit faster-paced than The Fellowship of the Ring, and the imagination factor is off the scale. Tolkien will take you to places you've never been: forests where tree-like Ents rule, or dark passages where vile creatures lurk, to name a few. Tolkien uses what I think is a brilliant strategy - he splits up his group and tells one's tale for awhile before switching to the other. You'll always be wondering about Frodo and Sam, or else Aragorn and his company at any given time. Hence, you'll end up loving the characters even more.<br />Devour every detail of this book. It is exquisitely written, and it's a book that deserves to be read slowly and deliberately so you can soak up every last word. Tolkien writes very poetic prose. A friend much smarter than I suggested that Frodo is much like Moby Dick's main character. That is, Frodo is the &quot;archetypal Christian struggling to deal with something well past his private reality&quot; (his words). I don't agree 100 percent, but it certainly is food for thought.	2001-05-03

I am used to reading &quot;pop&quot; fiction that can be ravaged in a day or two. Reading this book, however, gave me a new experience altogether - taking my time to see each image in my head and ponder each happening. It's a &quot;nibbling&quot; book, if you will.<br />Tolkien has painted an incredibly detailed world in Middle Earth. After reading the 40-page forward, you can really appreciate how much thought he actually put into this. I found the forward a bit tedious, but it refreshed my memory on the Hobbit (read years ago) and gave me a good backdrop of the story.<br />The characters are fantastic, and although a few of the secondary characters are little-mentioned, the main characters (Frodo, Sam, Pippen, Merry, Gandalf, Aragorn, et. al.) are rendered in great detail so that you soon begin to like them all very much for their feats (and their faults). Every adventure, every turn in Frodo's great quest to return a dark and mysterious ring, is so fascinating that I could only read about 30 pages at a time before closing the book, closing my eyes, and pondering and recreating what I had just read in my mind. I think that anyone willing to take the time and not rush through this one will really enjoy it. Happy trails!	2001-03-06

This would be many authors' best effort, but then again, this is McCammon we are talking about.<br />You should read this book for the same reasons you should read any McCammon book: He sizzles as a storyteller. He is one of the best prose writers in modern fiction. You will really lose yourself in this book, which I can only describe as wildly imaginative and captivating. Some of the book's sections will blow you away.  The part where Billy confronts a saw that screams like a man really chilled my blood.<br />The book weakens a bit toward the end. McCammon introduces some entirely new characters pretty late into the book. It's hard to care about them when you're so drawn into the characters he's been developing for 350 pages already: namely, Billy, Wayne and Ramona. The book's journey is ultimately a good one, though (even though it wraps up a little too neatly for my tastes), and it will make you contemplate whether you are on a mystery walk of your own.<br />If you are a fan of modern horror or suspense, you need to start reading McCammon's works, even if you decide that you aren't going to read this book. He's still a pretty well-kept secret, I think...	2001-02-20

I am not the &quot;smartest&quot; reader all of the time - I often can catch only the most obvious of metaphors and allegories. This book really speaks on many levels, and I think that's the true secret to its lasting power.<br />On the surface, the book is a well-written tale of an Abbey that has survived through the ages (the book takes place a millennium from now). The book is heavily layered, however, like an onion.How many times you read this book and how quick you are to catch on to various themes will determine how many layers you experience.<br />I was fortunate enough to consider some of the themes of the book, particularly that religion, although divinely inspired, will always be fallible because it is man-made. Some of the things the Abbey has made sacred (including the canonization of a Jew) really makes you think about how today's religion has been interpreted through the centuries. Another theme worth exploring is the fact that man really doesn't learn from his mistakes. This becomes hauntingly obvious in the last third of the book.<br />I would recommend this book to nearly anyone, especially those who enjoy a good sci-fi yarn or who like books that can be explored from so many different angles. I doubt this book will stay on my shelf too many years before I decide to give it another go.	2001-02-16

I just don't understand why you would spend an additional... [money] for this strategy guide. Don't get me wrong, Spider-Man is a great game and was well worth my money, but 95 percent of gamers won't feel a need for this unnessesary add-on.<br />As the previous reviewer mentioned, you get a good walkthrough but no cheats. Why do you need a walkthrough, though? The game is exquisitely rendered, but it is not a large game. If you are a fast learner or a great gamer, I suspect you could beat this game in a weekend without the help of a guide.<br />So why don't you need a guide? First off, there is a pretty nice training mode in the game where you can hone your Spidey skills. Secondly, no part of the game is particularly difficult or immense. Finally, you are given a pseudo-tutorial during the few spots you could get stumped. For example, I had a hard time finding Venom in the sewers, but after awhile, you run into Lizard and he tells you which tunnels you should take.<br />Like I said before, the game is great and I would recommend it to almost anyone. But it isn't a game that requires a guide. You're smart enough to do it yourself!	2001-02-12

Having read some other Crichton books (Jurassic Park, Congo, Sphere, etc.) I'd have to say this ranks up there with the best of his work.<br />A lot of reviews say you can read this book in a day or two. While I don't always have time to read every day, I did finish this book in about three sittings. You'll polish off 80-100 pages at a time without realizing any time has passed at all. That's because of tight writing, fast plot, and good attention to detail without drowning in it. I wish a lot of other writers who pad their stories could do that.<br />Crichton's work clocks in at about 270 pages. He could've easily watered down the plot and beefed up the book to 400-500 pages, and you've got to admire him for not doing that. He also explains very complex theories on bacteria and other biological phenomena without totally writing over the layman's head. Consequently, you actually learn a thing or two. Other works (i.e. Outbreak, the X-Files movie) have tried to copy plot elements of this book with minimal success.<br />In short, the book was not quite what I expected (somebody told me it was about bees!) but I was pleasantly surprised with a great biological thriller. You would do well to invest the short amount of time it would take to read this fantastic book.	2001-01-22

Keep checking used bookstores, e-bay, half.com...  it's definitely worth reading.<br />I cut my teeth on Dan Simmon's CARRION COMFORT, and while this isn't up to par with that absolute masterpiece, it's still a worthy pickup. For anyone who was a sixth-grader once, it will bring back great memories of horsing around, sharing friendships and adventures, and making those bonds that last a lifetime.<br />The book is a great suspense book in its own right, although a little shaky at the end (as previous reviews indicate, it's one of those Mission: Impossible things that they pull off when the bad guys suddenly and surprisingly falter). What makes Mr. Simmons utterly fantastic, however, is his great style of prose. Simmons moves back and forth among several intriguing characters, each with a great voice and story. His storytelling skills are on par with Stephen King, and you actually come to care about what is happening to each character.<br />An interesting aside, after you finish this book, check out CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT. It's not a bona fide sequel, but it takes place 20 years later, and you'll get a glimpse of what happened to the characters (especially the charismatic and caring Mike O'Roarke).

This pseudo-sequel to SUMMER OF NIGHT (Father O'Roarke and several minor characters loosely tie into the other book) is a fine example of what a suspense-slash-horror writer can be capable of. Ever since the magnificant CARRION COMFORT, Mr. Simmons has not disappointed me yet!<br />This has all of the markings of a great book - well developed characters, interesting plot (you'll also get a lesson or two on Romanian culture), twisted villians (corrupt politicians, lurking men dressed in black, etc.) and excellent stylings told through Kate (the heroine) and a series of dreams/flashbacks from Vlad Dracula himself!<br />The story is a hard-nosed, quick read about a hematologist (re: blood doctor) wrestling with the cure for AIDS as she also seeks to unravel the &quot;myth&quot; of vampirism from medically. It is an excellent idea, executed beautifully, and although it crumbles in a few places, the story will open up the imagination and stick with you long after you've turned the final page.	2001-01-18

It is laugh-out-loud funny, deliciously illustrated and has at least two good morals for the youngsters (don't lie is one, getting along with sisters/brothers is the other).<br />I am putting this away for when I have kids. I know enough to know that when kids latch onto a book, it had better be one that the parents are willing to read over and over and over. This is one of those fantastic books that won't lose its appeal thanks to humor, detailed illustrations and good writing.<br />It's too bad that Berkeley Breathed stopped doing OUTLAND and BLOOM COUNTY, but if he's going to keep doing projects like this, it's certainly not a waste of his time.	2001-01-18

MURDER, no matter how entertaining and delightful to read, falls far short of some of his finer efforts.<br />Koontz is similar to Stephen King in the scope of his novels, spinning yarns of supernatural horror. Unlike King, however, Koontz tries to explain the HOW and the WHY of the phenomenons he describes. He makes things like telepathy or severe espionage brainwashing seem totally plausible in THE DOOR TO DECEMBER and THE HOUSE OF THUNDER, respectively.<br />MR. MURDER, which attempts to explain cloning issues from a mysterious &quot;Network,&quot; is not given Koontz's usual care and consideration. Though the conclusion wraps up with some satisfaction, Koontz underdevelops the story of the &quot;Network,&quot; which should have had a far greater focus in the novel. Instead, readers have to read through 150 pages of fairly dry exposition before an initial confrontation even takes place.<br />I give this book 3 stars, but in all fairness, Koontz did a fine job on this one. Because I have seen him do so much better, I can't help but be a bit disappointed. New readers should start with the above-mentioned books, or perhaps DARKFALL, NIGHT CHILLS or WATCHERS.<br />An interesting side note - &quot;Santa's Twin,&quot; a poem the book's protagonist wrote for his children, has since been turned into an illustrated children's book of the same name.	2000-12-07

If you haven't read this book (why not?!?) it is without a doubt worth your time - and you, fair reader, deserve the enjoyment it will bring you.

The only reason you should ever read a book that is more than 800 pages long is to exercise your brain. This book is a grand endeavor that I gladly indulged in for weeks.<br />It's hard to wrap your mind around this book, but Simmons paints wonderful settings, complex characters and a great plot that weaves in supernatural theories on violence and control.<br />Another reason the book stands out among other hulking, 800+ page novels is Simmons' narrative style, which switches between the first-person observations of Melanie Fuller, a key player in the book, to a dozen third-person perspectives from equally interesting characters.<br />The book is exceptional because Melanie Fuller is a classic naiive narrator. That is, she is so self-deluded that her perspective cannot be taken at face value. Rather, they must be interpreted by the reader with analysis and reading on to see how the third-person accounts decode those same events.<br />In short, this book is wonderfully imaginative. In dusting off this book, you'll also be dusting some cobwebs out of your head and getting those rusty cogs turning again.	2000-11-27

It's hard to tell if Letha Albright should be labeled an &quot;up-and-comer&quot; - it's just too early. Her first published novel, Tulsa Time, is a wonderful book, but it almost seems as something that can't (or shouldn't) stand alone.<br />That's not an insult by a long shot. It's just that Viv Powers, the book's main character, has not developed herself enough in Albright's debut effort to satisfy most readers.<br />Such is the frustration with such well-crafted first-time novels. Viv is so utterly interesting, the depth of her character could easily be explored over a half-dozen more books. At the end of the novel, the only things noticeably lacking are sequels.<br />Viv, a small-town journalist, is thrown into a world of trouble when her significant other (Charlie) is charged with murdering Gil, his band's manager. With Charlie maintaining silence even to his lover, Viv decides to investigate (the mark of a true journalist!) and begins to uncover Charlie and his band's rocky past.<br />A good mystery should have two things. First, it needs a likeable (or at least interesting) hero(ine). Second, it needs the hooks and barbs that keep readers interested and guessing &quot;whodunit.&quot; Tulsa Time succeeds on both accounts.<br />Viv reminds me much of another mystery heroine - Kay Scarpetta from Patricia Cornwell's books (From Potter's Field, Cause of Death, etc.): strong-willed, stubborn, passionate.<br />The book holds interest well with short chapters and many twists. It describes with great beauty and care the setting of Talequah and Tulsa, Okla., with out drenching the reader in detail. Several other people who have read this book agree that it is nearly impossible to guess the culprit until the last 10 pages or so.<br />Get a copy of this book - it's worthy of two reads (at least) - and keep your fingers crossed for a sequel.
