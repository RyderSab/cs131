But to see him produce, not some fine work of historical exposition but this soulless babble is very sad.  Maybe the old 'publish or perish' dilemma made him push it out the door when it was still half-baked, I don't know.  But that describes this mind number: half-baked.  He shouldn't ask for customers, but go to institutions and request grants - it has no market.  For one thing he forgets that storytelling is what fiction is about.  But if the story is about jumping about in time, he should have put in a historical primer, even if just a good timeline, since few have his educational attainment standing by.  Then he should have perhaps settled for a collection of related short stories, concentrating on some fascinating incidents in a wide world not our own.  But what he gives us is one boring lecture on how nothing would have happened of interest in all of history if not for the Europeans - for that is the regrettable conclusion!  He makes Europeans into the master race by a process of elimination.  The world he shows us without their presence just plain SUCKS.  Life is hardly worth living in it.  All the interesting stuff happened in the Europe that never was, and even then he has no imaginative characters perhaps dreaming of it to keep us from falling asleep.  I think the lesson here is that \\"what-if\\" speculative history must control its premises or it becomes self-defeating.  I think this book pleases no one but its author - if it does even that.

Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ? : Challenging the Existence of an Historical Jesus	Books	5	38	49	N	N	In your face	The Bible is a pure history of absolute facts, right?  Adam and Eve existed, as did Noah, Elijah and the ravens, and Sampson.  <br />Zonk!  The Bible is a mishmash.  Nobody knows who wrote it, when or why.  There is plenty of fiction in it.  And the last book in it was written in 400-something B.C.E.  So why does everybody think that the \\"new\\" testament, about a savior called Jesus Christ, isn't fiction also?  Why is Jesus any more real than Adam and Eve?  <br />To believe in the Bible as all fact is what kids do.  Their parents teach them to.  They spend the rest of their life figuring out what parts are really fiction, but they stick to their belief in the Bible as divine.  By the time of the fall of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., these type of people had a major crisis.  Jerusalem was the home of Jehovah, the creator and author of the Bible.  If it had been destroyed by the *!?! Roman pagans, that proved that Jehovah is a hoax, as powerless as the pagan gods like Baal to protect his people, his temple, or even his \\"home\\" the holy of holies.  Let's say I'm a Bible believer who survived 70 A.D., perhaps because I'm a Jew living in Babylon or Alexandria, or perhaps I'm a Roman slave by now, but living a relative life of ease in some rich guy's palace like Tony Curtis in Spartacus.  How could Jehovah let Judaism be wiped off the face of the earth like that by those pagan brutes?  My parents taught me that Jehovah is truly all powerful, and all knowing. <BR> <BR>The only solution: he must have ARRANGED for the Romans to destroy Jerusalem.  He must have vacated the holy of holies before the Romans ever desecrated his temple.  He not only let them do it, but ordered them to do it somehow.  Why?  It had to be because the Jews, his chosen people, his \\"bride\\", had been very, very bad.  They must have done a really bad thing.  As Arnold would say, he was calling it a divorce. <br />I got it!  They killed a very special prophet that he had sent.  And that prophet was super special.It was his own son!  <br />Reading the sacred scriptures, a picture of a son of God that suffers for the sins of the people is extracted.  By now it's well past 70 A.D., but since there are no longer any witnesses to get in the way, a new scripture is constructed, backdating this prophet into the milieu of Jerusalem a good biblical time period earlier - 40 years.  Yes, Jehovah is merciful.  He warned them via his prophet, his very own son, and gave them 40 full years to repent (he always gives them 40 years, right? So Jesus must have died in 30 C.E.), and they didn't.  So, since he's just, he did what he promised, and let the axe fall: the Jews were no longer his chosen people.  Instead, all people of any tribe or nation who accept his son on faith are his chosen people.  A new religion is born...<br />And so was born with it the fictional character of Jesus Christ (Joshua the anointed, or Jesus's salvation anointed, in Hebrew-speak).  A hundred years later, among non-Jews, the fictional character is taken for real, and Christ-ianity (insanity) is born.  <br />Doherty's book is new in his discovery of what was in peoples' faces from day one, namely that the earliest preachers of a \\"risen Christ\\", from before the destruction of Jerusalem, haven't made up the details of the fictional character Jesus Christ yet.  They don't seem to have had the time.  That had to come much later.  Writing fiction is hard and slow work.  Paul may or may not be a real person himself, but whoever wrote those epistles attributed to him had never read the gospels and their story of Jesus Christ.  That's what Doherty throws in your face in his fine book.  It turns most Christians on their heads, using Paul as a witness to the non-existence of Jesus Christ.  <br />I tend to think that the writers of the Pauline epistles did it before the destruction of the Temple, since that is the key argument that makes the existence of a Jesus Christ necessary to the entire makeup of their Bible-believingmentalities.  As to the increasing embellishment of the fictional Jesus story with miraculous virgin births, mangers, wise men from the East, ad infinitum, that would come as the pagans moved into positions in the church and added their two cents worth.  It became a group fiction that evolved ever since. <br />A most brilliant work, a great achievement, that Jesus Christ story.  And so is Doherty's work.  Too bad it's about 1900 years too late to have prevented millions of deaths and untold suffering.  As far as the burden of proof on this subject, after 2000 years isn't it on Jesus Christ, to come back?  What's he waiting for?  He sure stiffed a lot of people with his claims he'd be back \\"soon\\".  At just what date will people finally give up and admit he isn't coming back?  That he never existed in the first place?  Jesus Christ is no more real than Noah, Adam and Eve, or any of the other fictional people in the Bible.	2002-08-17

This book is funny in the way it takes fiction, analyzes the guts out of it, deconstructs its plot and characters, then furnishes its own new plot twist.  In the present publishing market, it is clever to market fiction as nonfiction, because the latter usually sells better.  That said, I give it 3 stars. <br />My take on the whole Jesus thing is that it was always pure fiction.  As George Moore points out in his 1916 novel The Brook Kerith, 3 hours on the cross isn't enough to kill a man, the usual time it took being 3 days. (Marketed as fiction, his book flopped commercially).  As Earl Doherty points out in The Jesus Puzzle, the earliest Christians, including Paul and Peter seem to have never heard of a real person called Jesus of Nazareth, or his elaborate story.  Instead, they seem to have all personally \\"seen\\" a \\"Jesus Christ\\" in their visions, and find him backed up in the ancient Hebrew scriptures, which is all they had.  Paul's mission was self-appointed, and he seems to think he's the first one to really preach a Jesus Christ.  The first time Mary and Joseph are mentioned is by Ignatius at the end of the first century.  The gospels in the form we have them were written after the destruction of Israel by the Romans, when there were no witnesses left, Paul included.  It would be easy at that late date to back-fit a story to the combined work of the previous Christ-preachers.  Maybe John Allegro is right in The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross, when he says that many if not most of the underground religious movements in the Middle East back then were really amanita muscaria-eating psychedelic mushroom cults, the dropout hippies of their day.  Being totally zonked, the suffering of death in the arena wouldn't have been all that hard.  In any case Christianity was originally the religion of the slaves and other outcasts in a world seemingly to be run by Rome forever.  The Christianity we know today is the result of centuries of evolution and political power struggles.  The simple-simon founding myth of a barefoot hero in a lost world is unknowable by real history.	2002-08-12

And he brought you the Master of the Game. <BR>Is this some parlor tricks, some scientific solution, or some Kentucky windage?  Remind me not to think too hard about it.  <BR>It's like that book \\"To Serve Man\\" on Twilight Zone.  Hmmm... <br />This novel reads like a TV script without as much dialogue.  The plot is everything.  Characters are extremely stereotyped.  And I'm not trying to knock Sheldon, because this is his conscious style.  In TMOTG, when a guy is a tough hero, he is a tough hero.  When he is a sodomite Greek playboy, that's all he is.  The essence of the novel is extremes.  The McGregors are one-noters.  The founder of the dynasty is one tough and lucky and smart mule.  He steals his initial fortune, then just happens to be the smartest businessman in the country, and multiplies it.  However, he is the stupidest lover on earth.  He has a woman who can give him everything, and he ignores her while going awhorin' nightly.  Except when he gets drunk, gets her preggers, and then obsesses for ownership of the progeny, who turn out to be one-noters too.  Always the head of the class, always getting straight As, they are either cut out to take over the business empire, or determined to never touch it.  After all, they have some other precious talent, art or music, that can't be buried.  What a gene pool Jamie MacGregor must have come from.  Really, this gets kind of boring, and I'm glad the novel ended after only 495 pages.  It was just launching a new one-noter into the plot, and I didn't feel like sticking around.  But Sheldon was merciful, and he ended it.  His convenient glossing and whitewashing of the terrible white racism of South Africa beats the ease with which the Dallas writers dispensed with it.  Of course, everybody is racist except our \\"good guys\\".  And even though they are fabulously rich, they are not rich enough to stop their fellow countrymen from running over the \\"lower races\\" - but be sure they will try to help one or two who have been personal friends in times past.  \\"Some of my best friends are colored\\" - one line I would have cringed to see in print, was not here - thanks SS.  This is a LCD book - it sells to the lowest common denominator of IQ.  I give it 3 stars only because it's good at this.  It aims low and succeeds.	2002-05-14

He's a screenplay writer who has found paperbacks a good outlet for his better efforts.  His novels read like screenplays in print.  The language is at the 8th grade level, perfect short sentences with easy words.  His characters are stick figures that we all know before we read about them - stereotypes.  But Shelton shines with his ability to put them together into nice neat plot packages, where the good guy wins out, and the bad guy gets it in the end.  This novel is a prime case in point.  You can virtually fly your eyeballs over the pages of one-line paragraphs and tv soap-opera style dialogue.  But you are always interested in what's going to happen next.  You are hooked.  The plot, not the characters is the thing.  You know you are in for a surprise ending.  And you get it.  You might even shed a few tears.  You will remember the story a long time.  You will treasure it.  Who can deny Shelton his due?  This novel is one good fast read.  So many other novelists wish they could produce even one jewel like he pumps out by the dozen.	2002-04-11

It is not the rantings of a lunatic or bigot, but an essentially serious, scholarly piece.  The thesis is that there is an age-old conspiracy to unite all people under one government of men that can be traced back to ancient Babel, and that it is doomed to disaster.  In contrast, the Bible announces a kingdom of heaven run not by man, but by God, after people change in their hearts.  The many forces - many well-meaning - now converging on a mad dash towards a one world govt., Robertson claims, are being manipulated behind the scenes by none other than Lucifer/Satan, he claims.  On p. 126 an interesting comment was made by Robertson that he is from a privileged background making him an automatic beneficiary of the one world government new world order plot, so why would he come out against it if he weren't honest?  &quot;My answer is simple.  I believe in freedom... in equal opportunity for all people... I believe that God has never given anyone other than Jesus Christ enough wisdom to run this world.&quot;  In the last chapter Robertson indeed admits the need for worldwide cooperation among nations to solve ecological and other problems, but not at the expense of giving away America's sovereignty to the U.N., which is what he spends most of his ink warning against.  In an era when futurist views such as in the recently-released movie &quot;A.I.&quot; are, frankly, bankrupt, Robertson's book deserves to be read for a different vision.  NB.  He does NOT claim that &quot;Jews assassinated Lincoln.&quot;  He does speculate that European bankers intent on a one world govt. with a central bank under their control might have been behind the assassination, once Lincoln announced against them -- but he emphasizes that &quot;there is no hard evidence to prove it...it is my belief.&quot;  Put aside your assumptions and prejudices about PRand give this thoughtful book a test drive.	2001-06-30

They should have carved it into at least a dozen to give the others a fair chance.  In ten years I predict MS will have taken over, not just the computer room, but the whole house, even the toilet, and either own the Internet, or worse, have started a new system that they own from the ground up, under the guise of protecting authors of information products (software, music, movies) from &quot;free copying&quot;.

First, the good points, and there are many.  The concept of Focus -- 10! I am forever changed after obtaining this concept from Vinge: thanks!  The OnOff star and Spider World -- 8.  The Qeng Ho -- 9.5.  Pham Nuwen -- 8.  The Emergents - 2.5: why do I keep seeing shades of the House Harkonnen here?  The Qeng Ho and Emergents don't really seem different races; different political parties maybe.   The many great digs at software as an &quot;engineering&quot; discipline when it is in fact a cosmic mess in the making (shades of &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;) -- 8.5: now where did the satire on Bill Gates go? :)  The trouble with reviewing the book is that the author has so many great ideas he doesn't seem to have the power to deal with to a satisfying resolution.  For instance, he harps on how one shouldn't underestimate the ability of Focus to make the Focused loyal to their masters, then, ahem, you have to read to the ending to see how he discards it to give us a &quot;surprise ending&quot;.  Similarly, the realization that there never will be any &quot;warp drives&quot;, or any &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;, yet his acceptance of ramscoops, which go against too many known laws of physics to be worth more than the few novels they engendered already.  The spider people: here he seems to have hit his head on his own limits.  He tries to beg his own question, so to speak, of how horrible creatures that humans instinctively cringe at can develop higher intelligence, even love and morality, and still enjoy &quot;cold sucks&quot;, with a &quot;trick&quot; that some may swallow, but for me it just left me wanting a better, more imaginative author to drive the &quot;ramscoop&quot; of the novel into my psyche.  The one-dimensionality of the spider world was also disappointing.  Are humans alone in having &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; guys?  Why wouldn't the spiders adopt Focus to their own ends? For that matter, why wouldn't certain unscrupulous Qeng Ho?  Does Pham Nuwen tell them all what to do?  Nuwen, also, doesn't quite cut it as a hero; while I tried, I couldn't quite care about him, nor,  for that matter, any of the characters of any species. When the nukes were flying, I really didn't care if they all got vaporized, and I can't imagine anybody else who would either, including the author: the plot was all we cared to survive.  I also couldn't understand how the OnOff star was essential to the evolution of sapience in spiders rather than, for instance, woolly mammoths.  The Epilogue attempted, I think, to put the novel into a grander space frame, but to me it only destroyed the last illusion that the fictional world was real: the idea that &quot;superbeings&quot; left &quot;all this&quot; long ago for the human Qeng Ho to stumble onto, frankly, sucked eggplant.  Still, this is a novel that provokes deep thoughts.  If only the author had spent less energy on his academic career and more on his novelist career, he might have punched-through to the latent novel that was &quot;in there&quot; somewhere... I give it 4 out of 5 stars.	2000-12-12

I hope this doesn't end Baldacci's career, but it will certainly be something to  overcome, like Arnold's Last Action Hero and End of Days.

As it is, it seems curiously atavistic.  For example, no awareness of the work of Paula Friedricksen, 'Jesus of Nazareth', which raises the major  point of why, if Jesus was executed for sedition as a threat to Rome, his  followers were not executed with him, like in every other known instance in  Roman history. If they had been, how could there be any Christianity?  If  they weren't, how are we so sure there really was a crucifixion as opposed  to, say, beheading in jail like John the Baptist?  The book also suffers  from a lack of deep understanding of the Jews, their cult of Jehovah  worship, and their long history of resisting the hated Romans, and is  perhaps too much concerned with being PC and trying to disarm anti-semites.   Still, it's good enough that most people wanting to study the Jesus  question would not want to skip it.	2000-04-20

Combine minute textual analysis of the Bible with totally shocking and inept failure to understand the Bible, and you get this crock.  For example, claiming Jesus was  crucified instead of killed in jail because he was a political threat.   Well, what about the two thieves?  Were they political threats?  Did she  forget that Jesus' crime was blasphemy, and that Jehovah declared that  anybody hung on a stake is accursed to him (Deut. 21:23, Gal. 3:13)?  Jehovah: she acts like she never heard of him.  Jesus believed implicity in  Jehovah.  Jesus loved his people, and was sent as a judge, just like Samson  once was.  He was there to warn them that if they didn't repent and change  their ways, Jehovah would judge them.  Well, they didn't, and Jehovah made  the authorities do what they did.  Jehovah executed Jesus, and just used  the authorities as his agents, the same way he executed Israel itself once  using the Babylonians as his agents -- see Ezekiel, etc. Jehovah is the  most high, the one true god, and the one judge.  She just doesn't 'get' it.   Her claims that the gospel writers must have made it all up after  Jerusalem was destroyed, rather than before, is like calling them liars to  their face.  Making surface contradictions into branchoff points to her  theories is transparently sophistic.  What if the contradiction isn't there  when viewed more deeply?  Like Acts 15 seeming to show that the brothers of  Jesus in Jerusalem were against gentile converts eating blood, while he was  for it, because Luke 7:15 quotes Jesus as saying that nothing a man eats  can defile him, only his heart can defile him.  There is no contradiction  there.  The controversy was how gentile converts could commune with Jewish  converts, and eat at the same table, without the former becoming a  stumbling block to the latter.  They were to observe the laws for aliens  living in Israel, as listed in Deuteronomy, such as abstaining from blood.   This was voluntary, done in love.  The highest law, said Jesus, is to love  Jehovah, and to love your brother as yourself.  There were already many  Christians in Jerusalem before it fell, and Paul visited them, and asked  them to settle controversies, as Acts 15 in particular shows.  Paul was  executed by Nero before Jerusalem fell.  Does she believe Paul never saw a  gospel?  Where did all those Christians Nero persecuted come from?   Mushrooms?  Jesus was a Jew, and obeyed all the laws of Jehovah perfectly.   He was the only person portrayed this way in any scriptures.  His death had  a cosmic significance, which she pretends to scratch her head over as if it  came out of nowhere.  Paula, wake up and smell the roses. <br />In short, her  myopic analysis, taking Jesus as a real person but divorcing him from the  entire point of his being, namely, to fulfill the scriptures, and undo the  damage done by Adam and Eve, is bankrupt, as is her failure to grasp what  made people forsake 'the world' and follow him, facing Nero to the point of  death for a faith.  Or how all this stuff just got made up because  Jerusalem was invaded by the Romans and a million Jews murdered and the  temple destroyed.  Particulary after, since dead Jews don't make up and  disseminate gospels.  Or how people could be so dumb as to fall for it if  there was no proof offered. <br />Either accept Jesus at face value, or paint  the gospels as a fairy tale made up to fulfill scriptures with a dummy  corporation, and argue that the entire Bible is a fairy tale, and that some  mighty evil people purposely set out to perpetrate a cruel fraud on  humanity for unknown reasons, since the promulgation of the views would get  them persecuted by the most powerful empire in history, one that was  particularly cruel.  It would be amusing to get her to read some of the  books by the Jehovah's Witnesses.  Their works display more knowledge of  the Bible in every page than she shows in her whole book.  Their doctrine  against blood xfusions is based on, in part, falsely claiming that Acts 15  is a command to all Christians, in communion with converted natural Jews or  not, and that disobeying jeopardizes the soul, but at least they take the  Bible seriously, and grapple with the total question of Jesus as part of a  plan of Jehovah.  Her attempt to find a middle ground, as if Jesus was just  a lone nut deciding to quit carpentry one day and starting a movement,  daring the high priests to come and get him, and not knowing what he was  doing but just winging it, and doing everything right by accident, is  simply untenable, the realm of fiction not scholarship.  Jesus was no  Indiana Jones.  The discounting of the beliefs of millions is compounded by  her 'professorial' arrogance, living as she does in a little world where  she has status and privilege given to her by a powerful institution out to  protect its image.  I can imagine being one of her students and having to  regurgitate her ridiculous claims to get an A.  Her subject doesn't have  the pedagogic certainty of math and science, after all.  All of the above  make this book a trashcan stuffer, sorry.	2000-02-01

I hope this book's  success doesn't signal sci-fi's funeral as a serious genre, but only  something for kids and childish adults. <br />That being said, I still give  the book 5 stars because the way it gets into the heads of tabla rosa  children faced with, ahem, military service in war is inimitable.  The only  weak dimension is the poor depiction of the adults, particularly the nun,  who sounds like a Mormon rather than a Roman Catholic (compare the musings  of a Catholic mind in the Canticles of Leibowitz).  Card could probably  write a third or even fourth parallel novel and sell them all because  nobody else can make a kid's head come alive on the page so well and that  is, in the final analysis, what he's selling, not sci-fi. <br />Heinlein,  after all, already did Bugs.	2000-01-14

It's Xmas and they are prohibited from celebrating it.  Scrooges by decree.  It is true that they are a sect.  Even more, a cult. They are a budding Roman  Catholic Church, going through all the same early building phases,  including excommunication, which they call disfellowshipping.  Name changes  only.  Their basic belief is that only JWs are saved.  And yes, it was all  founded by a single man, who was treated as a virtual saint ever since, and  whose doctrines can never be disputed but only modified by a vote of a  small governing body.  Only JWs saved?  Yes, and that's why they go door to  door.  They think that's what saves them.  Everybody else will be turned  into manure by God and their flesh eaten by birds while they rejoice at  God's justice.  Jesus didn't go door to door, grin.  The second basic  belief is that  reading the Bible alone will not save you.  You must go  through the channel of the Watchtower and its literature.  While some of  their doctrines are great, such as the one concerning the soul, and the one  against hellfire, others are just plain nuts.  Blood transfusion taboo is  the worst, just like the book says.  It was a big mistake of the virtually  anonymous people at the top, the governing board.  They will have to change  it one day, and when they do the WT will be subject to massive lawsuits and  defections, just like the book says.  Like any cult, they say they are not  of this world, yet have a multibillion dollar corporation that fears  lawsuits.  So who is sad?  Reed's book is much needed, and I hope JWs read  it, even though the WT cult orders them not to.  I'm also sorry amazon.com  censors and suppresses reviews at will, as this is the second I've  submitted in 3-4 mos.	1999-12-22

What else is like it?  It presumptuously plunges you into a world so small you shouldn't care, that of a bored single male Brit, in a time when Britain has lost its  empire and its males are all in shock.  It has no really great plot, and no  real ending.  It just stops, leaving you stunned at the insolence of it.  The number of chapters is the same as the number of cards in a tarot deck;  so you realize when it's too late. The word &quot;accidie&quot;, which  Fowles is fond of (in the book and in the intro. to the rev. ed.), sheds  some light.  Accidie or acedia: spiritual sloth and indifference.  One of  the components of some tarot cards. A better name for the book than Magus  or even Godgame would have been Wheel of Fortune, with the famous music  &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; by Carl Orff as its muse: guess which chapter  would go with &quot;O Fortuna&quot;? :)  Modern Library's #93 of the top  100 best novels of the 21st century, I agree. It takes you from the 19th to  the threshold of the 21st in 600+ pages, then dumps you off on your butt,  scratching your head. The problem with untranslated French quotes can be  rectified by Fowles fan web sites, if that didn't occur to you. The  comparison with the Michael Douglas (1995) movie &quot;The Game&quot; is  unfair: a family resemblance at best. The novel is better as a novel, the  movie as a movie. Read it, it's worth the effort.	1999-07-14

To damn it with faint praise myself, it is a darn good try from a collegeless Mechanics Illustrated fan born right after WWI. It shows no knowledge of science  itself; could Bradbury explain the rocket equation, for instance? Written   right after the a-bomb was dropped on the world's consciousness, and the  mainly white GIs returned home to start the Baby Boom, what it does show is  a thinly disguised attempt at political satire, using &quot;Mars&quot; as a  stage prop. The cartoonish satirization of humanity, 50 years later, seems  silly. Yes, Ray, there were changes in society, and the year 2005 doesn't  look like the year the world will burn, sorry. If it does, there won't be  any people on Mars trying to jump on rockets and get fried either. You did  much better at satire in F451. In TMC, though, why did you end the last  chapter with the &quot;new Noah of Mars&quot; solemnly burning all of  Earth's books? Next thing you know, they'll be burning people up on Mars :)  The quaint descriptions of Bradbury's smalltown life would have done better  in a 'real' novel, say, about a lawyer named Finch fighting racial  prejudice :) In sum, don't read this unless somebody really gives you a  reason, because it's hoplessly obsolete.	1999-06-02

It's really a polemic on why war is necessary and fighting for your society is  good and moral. It just throws in some soft (not hard) sci-fi as window  dressing. It tries to show that all authoritarian military structures are  based on the same principles, all the way back to (and he quotes it  himself) Troy. The futuristic sci-fi is weak, cloudy, hesitant, as are the  alien 'bad guys'. The movie goes on where the book left off, making the  world and the aliens vividly real, but skimming the philosophy. Hence,  viewing the movie doesn't mean you've read the book, or vice-versa. As a  philosophical thought product, I'd give it 4 stars; as a novel, 3. But I  gave it 4 overall 'for the benefit of the doubt', like Rico's commander  gave him :) His native language is Tagalog? :)	1999-05-28

Being published in 1970, its social setting is frankly dated.  However, what sets it apart is a deeper level that, frankly, only hit me  between the eyes as I reached the halfway point of the book, down to the  page. Just who is this Duncan character anyway? And what makes him tick?  Atwood's photo reminds me of Alanis Morrissette plus 25 years and, in a  way, so does her writing; at least there's a family resemblance :)  I'm a  man and I don't understand women but this book helped NOT :) But I couldn't  put it down. Good read, but she's no Tom Wolfe.	1999-05-18

It is more like a Taoist fantasy of the (then) future (the 1990s), for people who wish they lived in a 'better  world', but don't realize that every change has implications. It is for  people who hate sci-fi, actually. Ursula Kroeger Le Guin, from a family of  anthropologists, brings a refinement to the table that is likely to make  you want to read it twice. Not a feminist book, its one lapse is in not  imagining a world of sexual equality 'for fun', along with a world where  everybody is gray, to end racial inequality, for example.  Citizens arrest  and summary euthanasia for cancer or defective genes -- that made me laugh.   If you're looking for a delicious, nutritious read, buy this jewel.	1999-05-09

Poor characters, thrown in to illustrate the sci-fi; politically incorrect; out of date, no mention even of the Web or the Net :).  The  sequels however are better, and so this becomes required.  Greg Bear did a  better job with the idea of a space potato in 'Eon', but neither is so good  that somebody won't write a topper sometime in the future.  The worst  aspect is placing the action in the 22nd century, when it would be out of  date even in the 21st. Still, it's an easy read, 8th grade level, meant for  mass audiences. To this reviewer there was no sense of wonder, awe, or  anything else, just the picture of an author making up stuff that doesn't  live on its own, and has no depth: schlock. Sorry, Charlie.	1999-05-02

Manages to analyze Vietnam and show the stupidity of America's involvement with it, while ostensibly telling a love-triangle crime &amp; punishment story complete with a French  Raskolnikov. After one reading, you can read it again, taking Pyle for  America's government itself, Phuong for the Vietnamese people (they make  dangerous bedfellows :), and Fowler for Greene himself. The magnificent use  of a few words to characterize people and places is world class. This book  is maybe the best novel of the 20th century, certainly of the '50s.  Must-read for any literate American. Too bad it didn't mention that Vietnam  had been fighting China for 1000 years and could never become its puppet in  a 'domino theory'; all the Viets wanted was to get the colonialists out,  and mistook America for such. A neutral unified VN would have been accepted  by Ho Chi Minh, as McNamara now admits, but nobody knew to propose it,  because the VN assumed everybody knew their history and never talked about  it :) Even today, America is VN's natural ally against Chinese imperialism.	1999-05-01

'How to Paint a Mona Lisa', 'How to Play Like Yo-Yo Ma', etc. All this book did is show that sci-fi writers are going thru such lean times that they can make more money  selling how-to books than doing their 'thing'. Seriously, would a real pro  in a crowded market sell his secrets for success for a few bucks, hoping to  create his own competition? Not likely. Writing great lit. takes a  dedication to art that makes this slim how-to volume seem like an insult,  sorry.

The style is more like that of a screenplay, fast to read and filled with short paragraphs and dialog. The content is an international spy thriller, involving, and tying together,  Vietnam heroes, Soviet spies, brainwashing science, the Manchurian  Candidate, and scenes in Japan, London, and St. Moritz. This is not a  horror novel, anymore than The Boys in Brazil. There is no supernatural  element here. The story is good, and you will like it.

King can also be deeper. Koontz' novels like to feature a white  middle class male, his faithful wife, and a spunky kid, whose life is  disrupted by the supernatural. Here, the kid is handicapped and adopted.  The man dies and is rescuscitated, changing him and giving the story its  hook.  The supernatural is in the form of a young satanist male, a former  California mall rat type, who lives in an abandoned funhouse, tries to kill  the kid, and present it to Satan as a sacrifice to get into Hell.  Add to  this Koontz' knack for describing things with apt adjectives, and you have  one of his better productions. Unbelievable silly gunk presented as  matter-of-fact reporting, and begging to be made into a screenplay so he  can afford his Newport Beach lifestyle :)	1999-04-09

It can take over animate and inanimate things, and doesn't know the difference, so it animates corpses.   This would make a good short story,  and it was once. It makes a mediocre novel. He just fills in extra words to  reach novel length, with no new substance. All in 8th grade English.  The  one bright spot is his technique of keeping you reading on by stringing  bits and pieces of expectation in front of you. Otherwise, it's not  imaginative, original, or especially entertaining.

But, on the journey, they will be forced to become super geniuses,  and perhaps solve Earth's problems as a side-product! Silly, but somehow,  Pohl pulls it off convincingly.  Pohl's English is sometimes quaint (e.g.,  'Januarys'), but his obvious attempt to study hard science and put it in  his sci-fi in a popular form is commendable.

The writing style is clear and  fast-flowing, even if the great mythic depths are either missing or thin  and shallow. The vampire angle interests some. It is a read mainly for  women, creating a world where they are equal to men, but that doesn't make  them lesbians to get it. It is escapist fiction, and after reading 500  pages you won't know anything new, but you will have escaped for awhile  from whatever it is that ails you.	1999-02-14

The book seems almost like a formula for a good read, but I think he  discovered the formula for himself by hard work, not by going to some  school :) The Bridges of Madison County comes to mind, Clint Eastwood  coming of age. A 40+ novelist loses his novelist wife, then gets a  20-something cutie to go for him, and he is rich enough to afford both her  and her cutie daughter. That much sounds like King himself letting his  libido show. Then he grafts onto it a scary story about a haunted house,  evil old men and women, drowned kids, laughing blues singers from the turn  of the century, and scatters Maine lore throughout to keep you turning  pages. The only criticism is that the first 100 pages are too slow. After  that it picks up.

Sorry, but after slaving through this 150,000 word tome, I felt cheated. I could have had a V-8 :) The characters are shallow,  wooden stick figures. Bear spends a lot of time creating a family for  Patricia, then drops it like a, well, potato :)  He didn't have the  imagination to bring them back in at the end like any good author would  have, and have events lead to psychological self-discoveries. You can get  that much in a TV movie of the week!  The sole positive is his apparent  superficial study of relativity theory and topology, and his plot device of  the Stone itself.

All this cyberpunk stuff, started by  Neuromancer, is just words minced around, with no real content.  The prize  goes to the best word mincer.

As a novel, the book struggles, most notably an attempt to get into the mind of Gen. Robert E. Lee. As sci-fi, it is a dud.  South African white supremacists build a time machine, go back to the  Confederacy, and give them AK-47s, ammo, and freeze-dried munitions? Why  not have them go back to 1776 and change the Declaration of Independence?  Why not go back to WWII and give Hitler the h-bomb?  I can't see that this  kind of fiction gets much of anything done, from its basic presumption that  reality is that changeable. There might as well be no history then. Or  values.  Turtledove would have done far better to have used his historical  skills to have created a believable story about a genius arising in the  South who created a superior weapon and changed the war's outcome. Was this  not even thought of by Turtledove, or considered too hard for his talent to  pull off? Either way, don't call this book sci-fi.

If they just labelled it as  pre-teenie material per se, like the Hardy Boys, maybe it wouldn't get such  a terrible review from me. But this example of vanity publishing by the  super rich Hubbard, using his own publishing house, offers it dead pan to  all, in competition with writers like Tom Wolfe and Tom Clancy. Forget it.

Unthinkable  complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and  constellations of data.&quot; This book seduces you into its world  irresistably. The characters, Case, Molly with her razors, Armitage the  psycho GI, Wintermute the AI, Maelcum the Jamaican. The places: Chiba City,  the Rue Jules Verne. Totally stunning and unforgettable.  The author  clearly has too much respect for computers, and probably never used one,  but his powerful cyberspace vision has been enthusiastically adopted by  real hackers and net surfers ever sense. So, it is a must-read.  The author  clearly was of the starving variety prior to this novel's success, and he  pulls out all stops showing how great his grasp of the language is, hoping  to sell something and stave off the wolf. So, it's a delicious page-turner,  a good read for the literate, but a hard, difficult read for those who  &quot;ain't.&quot;  Unfortunately, he almost mined-out the cyberspace  concept in one book, when he was trying to create a new genre.  That just  makes the book all the more valuable and unique.	1998-11-26

Some people own a cat for years and still don't know the first thing about them or how to properly take care of them.  This book gives you a  luminous insight into their super-selfish but predictable behavior, such as  why they seem to turn around and try to get back in a door when you let  them out.  The many photos are great too, as is the history of where our  domestic cats come from. All in all, &quot;America's best known animal  psychologist&quot; is not an understatement.  Dr. Michael Fox rocks!	1998-11-26

I read it years ago, and it still makes an impression in my mind like a bell going ding-dong-ding.  Back in 1983, the Japanese were giants, seemingly invulnerable, and  threatening America daily.  This book is how America still had one  advantage, creativity, and how the Japanese countered by sending industrial  spies to Silicon Valley.  The scenes of infiltrating a SV company, then  getting the chip back to America on a tramp steamer, are memorable.  The  scenes in Japan itself, showing the Japanese corporate hierarchy as still  bound to samurai tradition, are even more so.  Kensi means one's samurai  teacher, the kind you greet with a mean sharp sword in your holster and bow  to.  For Americans who still don't understand the Japanese, this book  filled a need.  Too bad it's out of print.	1998-11-21

It is a game that combines luck with skill, and the killer instincts of one-on-one  play, and the thrill is in  taking every chance when it should be taken.   Some mathematical purists might find fault with some of his conclusions  about starting moves, etc., but his power to move you with the power and  appeal of the game is top drawer.  Get a computerized backgammon game to practice with  before/during/after you read of this delicious  intermediate-level game  manual.	1998-11-21

They haven't read this book.  Written by an acknowledged expert of card games, card tricks, and detection of cheating, the book starts out with a priceless explanation of how card  sharks cheat, and how to spot it.  His advice is always to just get up and  get out when cheating is suspected.  He then explains how to play poker,  gin, pinochle, blackjack, and many others, with great advice on how to win  within the rules.  There are plenty of &quot;complete Hoyle&quot; type  books with lists of rules, but this one goes them one-up with the priceless  savvy it gives you about the real world.	1998-11-21

People who are leery of it because of its Scientology connection are right.  The book is like an initiation test: if  you are dull enough to have your mind rewired into mush by this long book,  you're ready for your first session! The book perverts your thinking,  slowly, subtly, to believe that the Earth is, basically, expendable,  and  that all that matters in the universe is organizational power and money!  True! It takes 900+ pages of reading to realize this. The prose level of  the book is 'dumbed down', and there are even [] brackets around  'variables' like place names, as if it was filled in later by a computer!   The book does teach the theory of organizations, Scientology for instance,  and how they're all based on money and power. Maybe it is an attempt of  somebody in Scientology to cry out, like those horror movies of a person  trapped on the wrong side of a TV screen (grin).  Sadly, if it had been far  shorter, and more lively, there was an amusing sci-fi story in here, the  Psychlos being a good idea, and characters like Terl quite memorable. The  people are less memorable than the aliens. I can see why they couldn't make  it into a movie.	1998-11-20

The Latin is mainly quotes  from the Bible, but it adds to your enjoyment to be able to understand  it  so use a search engine and download and save the translations before  beginning your reading.	1998-11-20
US	50952859	R222MNBH7EKAMO	0553288105	229605670	The Gods Themselves	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Priceless	This book is really 3 novelettes: 'Against Stupidity', 'The Gods Themselves', 'Struggle in Vain'.  The first and third are, quite simply, mediocre fare, and trivialize the future not predict it.  The second is  brilliant, and is worth the price of the book.  It wouldn't hurt you to  just read part 2 and skip the rest.  The common theme is based on Asimov's  knowledge of chemistry turned into an absurd con game, and is laughable by  the time you finish part 3 and see how he solves the problems his con game  creates, the con game being a source of free infinite energy for mankind.   Sure :)<br />Part 2 is on a different plane.  It reveals a new race of triad  creatures, where 2 pseudo-males start out mating, then inviting a  pseudo-female to join in, and then all 3 mate, and eventually fuse into a  new form.  With today's homosexuality and sex role debate, this cute  novelette is particularly worthwhile reading.  It is not really  homosexuality either, it is trisexuality, and a profound contribution.   Don't get confused by all the new words and terminology when you start, as  by the time you are halfway through it will all suddenly make sense, and  become beautiful and you will know you learned something profitable and  rare.  You might want to read it twice. Or thrice :)<br /> If Asimov weren't  subject to the rules of the paperback market back in the '70s, he might  have gotten by publishing just part 2 and today it would be a highly  acclaimed classic.  Maybe it will be one day. :)	1998-11-06
US	50952859	RK4VJBJXAP84S	0446670626	542041063	I, Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay	Books	4	4	25	N	N	A book still in search of a screenplay	Despite the many complaints that I, Robot was never filmed, I think this screenplay attempt shows why it wasn't.  It doesn't have the punch needed for a high budget flick to bring in the crowds, sorry.  The idea of robots  is trite to audiences, and the 'surprise' that the leader of their govt. is  a robot in disguise... which Star Trek episode WAS that? :)  The main  character, Ms. Calvin, is as sexless as a marble statue, and audiences  could get more sex in 5 minutes of Dallas or Days of Our Lives. In short,  the screenplay's Asimov roots really hurts it, Asimov can't handle sex and  real human emotions and himself thinks like a robot, and this screenplay  can't get around it.  I could see Martin Sheen as the reporter, but I  already saw that one :) Who would play Dr. Susan? Meryl Streep? :) Sorry,  this movie would bomb like Blade Runner. If it were rewritten yet again, by  a screenwriter who knows how to please crowds, it might still fly, but  then, Asimov purists might wrinkle up their noses. So there you go :)	1998-11-06

But face it, Heinlein totally failed to forsee the rise of the personal computer, the Net, and Bill Gates, and so his vision of 2076 is fatally flawed.  His  science is pretty poor too, such as the idea that the Earth needs the Moon  at all. And the idea that the Moon can be self-sufficient is highly  suspect.  The effect the low gravity has on people being irreversible is  also suspect. END	1998-11-06

It fills a need for a body of Klingon literature, and is well-done.

US	50952859	R3IM53WWX1KWZB	0449130703	24584033	The Number of the Beast	Books	3	0	3	N	N	Flip a coin	Is this book: 1) a parody of sci-fi 2) an in-joke 3) an attempt to force himself to get something written to make money 4) a brilliant work above my head. I can't decide :) He uses the device of having each of the characters  take turns. Narrating, being captain, you name it. The whole book is about  2 married couples who are supposedly geniuses and into free love, or at  least nudity.  Yet there is no real description of love making, fitting the  stereotypes about sci-fi writers such as Asimov being unable to really  handle sex.  The 'science' in it is retarded, not genius.  The universe is  6 to the 6th to the 6th dimensions, and they have a ship that can flip a  dial and go to any of them, which they do, instantly, and often back and  forth again and again, usually in the nick of time to avoid a catastrophe,  since one of them has a 6th sense :)  By the end, they are going to Oz, and  this degrades the book to garbage as far as I am concerned.  A sci-fi  writer of his fame should have had a better imagination.  The very ending  is a little bit cool, if you can stand the long boredom between the rather  good first part and the next 250 pages :)  All in all, it seems a sad case  of self-parody cheapening the author, like the Arnold movie Last Action  Hero cheapened Arnold by making his character tell people that all action  movies are phony and people who like them are dumb, then wanting people to  pay to have this told them. :) Still, I sometimes get the unsettling  feeling that this is really a brilliant book and is sailing over my head,  and one day I might really get it and look dumb :)	1998-11-03

The cavalier way Spielberg  changed and juked the story around to make it into not one but two movies  shows these two were made for each other :) Anybody can read this novel and  not strain their brain, or upgrade their reading skills beyond about 8th  grade.  A profound masterwork of an author who gives people what they want  rather than what he wants them to have, and my hat's off to him for showing  a budding author the Way :) How about a sequel giving Spielberg an excuse  for re-creating the Ice Age and its woolly mammoths and fantastic ice  world? :)  Another re-creating pre-human man-apes :)  Another re-creating  ...	1998-11-01
US	50952859	R28FB5FSLXS3XL	1568492669	327822364	Coma	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Start your habit here	Robin Cook is not an author, he is a habit.  This book is the first to  read to start your habit.  He  at least knows his limitations and his  writing career since has not strayed much out of what he is good at, which  is, novels about 'inside the medical world', from a doctor, who thrills  non-medical people with the inside knowledge of hospitals, drug companies,  research labs, etc.  Anybody thinking of going into medicine should  definitely gobble him up.  Some of his novels have better plots than  others, but they are all like mind candy, they can all be swallowed in one  swallow, they are fast reads, always leave you with some knowledge you are  glad to get, and wanting Cook to write more and more. Personally, I read  this book years ago, and within days I had raided used book stores for  every paperback ed. of his other novels I could get, and they still sit in  my living room bookcase, all soiled from my sloppy reading habits :)  Coma  stands out as the best, for some reason, maybe the  novelty at the time.  That's where the word 'novel' comes from :)  Just don't read this book  thinking you can go on and read other authors, you will have to go get more  'Cook books' like I did, and be 'Cooking' for a long time before you can  let it go for another author :)	1998-11-01

The pro-Catholic  slant is what sets is apart, since most sci-fi writers are anti-religious  and carry union cards.  The book might serve as the biggest intro. to the  bizarre logicism of Catholic thinking anti-religious people will ever get,  ironically.  It was astronomically arrogant to include so many Latin  sentences and not supply translations in footnotes or anywhere else.   People should get even by just skipping the Latin completely on a first  reading, for Miller must not have really wanted it to be read anyway except  as an in-joke for others inside the CC.  The saying is that the more the CC  changes the more it stays the same, and that's the reality here too, that  all science and technology and politics are just so much background scenery  to the 'real' CC, and even if mankind blows up the planet, it will just  send out spaceships and start somewhere else.  So it is profoundly  anti-science and anti-technology in its  final message.  I believe Miller  really took Catholicism seriously when he wrote it, that's why his suicide  in 1997 should be taken as his final belly laugh.  The world did not blow  itself up, the Communist party self-destructed even, but he gave up on his  faith.<br />Or maybe the royalties dropped. :)  In sum, read it, and weep.   Legite libre ad astra per aspera. :)	1998-10-24
