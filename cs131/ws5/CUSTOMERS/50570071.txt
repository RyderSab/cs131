My father was born in June 1905 and is living with me.  He graduated from Columbia College in 1929.  My father visited me in Iran in 1971 during my two years of Peace Corps service in Iran, 1970-72.  He made another trip to Tabriz in 1973 via the RCD raiload link.  I traveled through Quchan, Boojnoord, Gorgan, and Enzeli (Bandar-e Pahlavi).  There is no mention in the book of the famed Orientalist, Joseph Wolf, 1795-1862.  I am wondering why he was omitted?  On p. 50 Reiss writes \\"...a pan-Turkic empire stretching from the Bosporus to Bukhara...\\"  We must not forget that the Uighur Yakub Beg struck his gold tillas in Kashgar citing an an Ottoman overlord.  On p. 71 a warship is encounterd on the Caspian; is this the renamed Karl Liebnicht which had shelled the British in Enzeli?  An orientalist was defined as a scholar who had mastered the great literature in Arabic, Persian and Ottoman Turkish.  Had Nussimbaum mastered Arabic as well as Azeri Turkish and Persian?	2005-09-24

The author has an excellent command of English; further, she is a gifted writer.   This book is far superior to SAFFRON SKY by Gelareh Asayesh and TO SEE AND SEE AGAIN by Tara Bahrampour.  Ms. Moaveni is a trained journalist unlike these other two authors.   A glossary of Persian terms and personalities  cited in the book would have aided the reader.  The book would have benefited from an index.  Perhaps, in a future book the author could visit the Iranian Shahrestan.  She did cite a trip to Kermanshah on p. 72 placing it in 'a Kurdish province of northwestern Tehran'.  Tehran should be replaced by Iran.  This is the only error that I could find in the book.	2005-04-27

I saw only one reference to the Peace Corps in the index.  1968 was a year in which the number of American Peace Corps Volunteers were at their zenith.  Peace Corps Volunteers were serving in large numbers in Iran and Afghanistan in 1968.  Both of these countries were displaying civility in this crucial year.  There was little civil unrest in either nation at that time.  This is juxtaposed to the riots in much of Western Europe and the USA.  Such is this dichotomy.	2004-01-03

I wish that the author had devoted a comparison with American Peace Corps Volunteers who served in places like Atar, Mauritania; Sarh, Tchad; Farah, Afghanistan; Zabol, Iran, or Zinder.

This is a sociological study of the Americans who emigrated to Canada during the late 1960s and early 1970s.  I believe that there is an attempt to draw an analogy with the Americans who chose Peace Corps service during this period of time with those who went to Canada.  This is an invalid comparison.  American Peace Corps volunteers served in places like Atar, Mauritania; Qandahar, Afghanistan; Bilma, Niger; Kikwit, Zaire; Sarh, Tchad; and Zabol, Iran.  Most of the Americans that went to Canada chose to live in southern Onatrio, viz. Toronto.  How many went to Lac St. Jean, Quebec or Churchill, Manitoba?  Few.  These sites would have been partially commensurate with the difficulty of the Peace Corps sites.	2001-08-02

As one who travelled overland from Mashad, Iran to Herat, Afghanistan in March 1971 and April 1972, while an American Peace Corps volunteer in Iran, (6/70-6/72), I can relate to the setting.  Shah Tahmasp II was ruling as the last of the Safavid Shahs of Persia, when two Afghan 'sardars', Mahmud and Ashraf conquered Isfahan, the Safavid capital, as well as the earlier capital Qazvin.  Mahmud and Ashraf were from the Hotaki (Ghilzai) dynasty.  They imposed Sunni rule briefly on Shi'ia Persia.  The book has much suspense and is historically accurate.  An excellent read.	2001-07-24

All of these books were authored during the last twenty years. Each of these authors had a unique cross cultural experience that resulted in their expressed opinons having a great deal of credence.
