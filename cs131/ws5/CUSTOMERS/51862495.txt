Great Recipes to Make the Most of Your Stand Mixer	Books	2	21	30	N	N	House Organ	This is just a supplemental book for the Kitchen Aid mixer line.  I agree with another reviewer, you'd spend as much time assembling and then cleaning the attachments as if you'd done it conventionally.  Reminds me of all the food processor cookbooks that came out twenty-something years ago, finding excuses to use the machine even when not called for.  I guess that maybe if people got a K'Aid and wanted to play with their new toy and its attachments that this would make sense.  Many of the recipes sound a little too twee for me anyway.  The meatloaf looks repulsive, is really more a meat-and-vegetable pate than a true meat loaf--and expensive to make!  Desserts, pastries, breads, the real strong points of a good stand mixer, are shortchanged in this book.  I use Bosch and Electrolux mixers rather than K'Aid (not strong enough) and found little to use in my machines.  Avoid unless you can get it cheap--	2005-08-09

Sean Dillon has gotten so civilized that this seems a rehash.  Part of Connery's appeal as Bond, never duplicated, was his 'animal magnetism'.  Dillon had some of this in his earlier books, not here.  I bought this book as an unabridged audio CD while on the road on business, and was disappointed in the reader.  I must confess I've done all the Higgins books I've read before on audio cassette with Patrick MacNee reading, and what pleasure that was!  This reader can't help but compare poorly with MacNee, and he does.  MacNee always pronounced Hannah's last name as \\"Bernsteen\\" with a long 'e', I'm used to it, and now this reader does \\"Bernstein\\", like Lenny.  Unfortunately, the MacNee tapes aren't on CD and rental cars don't play cassette anymore.  If you can do cassettes, give a listen to the older recordings, they're great on audio.  This is okay, but not worth wasting time on.	2005-08-09

It is an excellent peek into the daily workings of the Nixon White House.  It's amazing to read this very large volume and realize how much time was wasted by Nixon trying to analyze and manage personalities on his staff, particularly the feud between Kissinger and Rogers.  Perhaps every White House staff is like this.  We won't know because no one since has put out this type of detailed record.  In the Watergate era I considered Haldeman, along with Erlichman, to be some of the most repulsive characters in American politics.  My opinion of Haldeman hasn't changed; he's still a man I'd rather not meet.  His defense that he was Nixon's mouthpiece doesn't hold water any more than military men who insist they were \\"following orders\\".  My impression upon finishing the book is relief that I've never had to work in such an awful atmosphere.  Great historical record, though.	2005-07-18

No, it's not comprehensive and doesn't pretend to be.  However, like doughnuts and coffee, the two just go well together.  Some of the recipes, particularly desserts, rely too much on processed foods I wouldn't want to make.  The meats and vegetables are better.

You needn't worry with Ms. Blair's work.  It does help if you know basic cooking techniques simply because the recipes are quite brief on those.  What happened to her cookie book?

As with many other cookbooks that are reissued, they attract new readers with each issue.  Back when Ms. Heatter's books were first issued I was doing all whole grains and foods and wouldn't have dreamed of using her recipes.  Now, many years later, I am delighted to have them.  One of the particular attractions to Ms. Heatter's books for me is the blend of experience and technical information.  I don't agree with others that she is overly verbose in her recipes.  In fact, her explanations of many of the processes in cooking and baking are very helpful to the novice and experienced baker alike.  I find it much easier to sift out instructions than to dream them up from an overly terse recording.  Having said that, the cookies are fantastic, every one I've tried, and I'd recommend this as a standard reference on the subject.	2005-07-18

Whatever happened to zippered Bibles?  They were so common when I was a little kid (and I had/have one).  They are so practical because they protect so well.  I was delighted to find the NASB Updated translation in a zipper version.  It travels in my briefcase where a regular Bible would get its edges all messed up.  I would've been happy with a simulated leather cover for this use, but the bonded leather is okay.  Small print, but I can read it easily without my bifocals.  As for the translation, either you want the most accurate or you don't.  I'm no genius but I don't need a 'readable' Bible--this one reads just fine for me.  I have been an owner of the 'old' NASB and rarely can I tell the difference between the two.  Highly recommended for a Bible on the go!	2005-03-20

Why 4 stars, and not 5?  Kirkbride has cheapened its Bibles since I bought my first, the KJV 1964 edition.  The pages are not as well-attached, the paper is much slicker and thinner--in short, more like Nelson and World Bibles.  My old KJV Thompson has gone through thick and thin for many years and I'm not sure about these newer, cheaper ones.  I notice Kirkbride is having these printed up in Korea now, also, and the type, particularly on the NASB, is not of the quality of the older ones, either.  But then, what nowadays is better made?  It'd probably cost at least twice the price of this Bible to make it the old way.  Plus, this in no way negates the superb layout and 'neutrality' of this study Bible.

Like the prior reviewer, I think we should all read and study more than one translation.  I primarily use the NAS translation and have since it came out.  I really don't like the NIV translation, and remain surprised that it has proven so popular.  And, no, I don't consider myself conservative at all, just accurate.  Regardless, I bought this Bible for the ease of use with the most common translation alongside the one I prefer.  I consult it often.  It follows the same basic format as the 4-translation Zondervan that I own, only there are only two.  This makes it a much smaller Bible, comparable to many regular-sized Bibles.  I particularly appreciate this Bible for reading, though, because it isn't cluttered with lots of marginal notes or 'study aids'.  It can just be read like one's favorite book.  As usual, this Bible receives 4 stars instead of 5 because the construction quality is not the best, but is good.  Legible type aids in reading, also.  I'm glad I own it, and it is suitable in size to carry to church, unlike its big brother.	2005-02-27

However, I found the layout of this Bible very amenable to Bible study.  I particularly appreciate Zondervan's giving the Amplified translation more room in the NT so that the total Bible size can be held down.  Certainly these pages are thin, and I probably wouldn't recommend a lot of marking on them, but again, this was done in the interest of holding the total size and weight to a reasonable level.  And yes, I consider it reasonable; I've got other study Bibles as heavy as this one.  I won't give 5 stars because I think construction quality should be better, but we'll just keep the bookbinders in business!

This is a delightful little volume that will remind many of us why we belong to the Presbyterian Church.  It has always been more 'comfortable' to belong to a more militaristic style of church, where, regardless of what is stated, the members are expected to fall in line with church doctrine.  I believe this freedom, this lack of forcing, has cost the Presbyterian Church many members--those who migrate to fundamentalist churches.  The question, then, is whether this has necessarily been a bad thing.  Like other reviewers, I particularly liked the chapter on 'whether one is saved' or not.<br /><br />I believe in the basic inerrancy of the original autographs of the Bible, and certainly believe that a number of modern translations are distorting the word.  A parallel Bible will illustrate it.  Again, as a Presbyterian, I believe each individual should decide.  This book perhaps strays somewhat on the 'liberal' side of that debate for me.<br /><br />Don't dismiss it out of hand, however.  There is valuable information here, regardless of what the Minister reviewer states.  Again, our freedom to differ is what does make us special!	2005-02-27

I must confess, I ended up giving this Bible away.  Though I am primarily a Thompson NASB and KJV user, I bought this Bible to cross-reference with the less-accurate NIV translation.  However, I bought it in Handi-Size, which really leaves a tiny print.  Rather than altering the layout, the total print picture is simply smaller than the regular size.  Now, I have reasonably good vision for a bifocal man in his forties, but it was just too hard for me to read, and I gave it to one of my employees with younger and better eyes.  I would recommend that anyone actually look over this smaller size before buying.<br /><br />Like my NASB Thompson, construction is certainly better than Nelson and some others, just not up to Kirkbride's older standard.

It is foolish, in my estimation, to expect a book in this price range and size to go into \\"restoring\\" sewing machines. Common sense should rule that out.  It is also no primer in the heavy-duty repair of machines; the author rightly directs the reader to a dealer for that.  What remains in an excellent guide for the average person in doing minor maintenance on a machine.  As an owner and sewer for nearly thirty years, I wouldn't dream of taking apart my computer Bernina machines but had a good time dissembling some old Singer machines--and the advice worked!  I saw nothing wrong with the author's advice on shopping and buying machines, though this might vary with geography and local dealers.  Though I was already aware of it, I thought his section on who owns who in the sewing world, and where machines come from, was interesting.  This was not meant to be investigative writing, and no doubt the author did not wish to injure independent dealers.  I found his recommendations for how to shop for machines by price to be spot on, though of course prices do go obsolete.  I particularly enjoyed the full-color photos of the steps involved in minor cleaning of the machines.<br /><br />For this price, this is a great first book on sewing machines and their workings.	2005-01-12

I began doing machine embroidery more than 20 years ago, before we had the computerized machines and certainly before the current crop of automatic embroidery machines were available.  The secret to doing decent freehand embroidery, yes, on ANY machine, is to practice, practice, practice, and then practice some more.  I am amazed when I show my work to those new in the interest that they expect to sit down one day and turn out some sort of masterpiece!  This is an art form like any other, and it is not mastered in a day, or a year for that matter.  We have beautiful examples of machine embroidery done in the 19th century on straight-stitch-only machines, and it can still be done.  Personally, I seldom use more than the straight and zigzag stitches on my machines, some of which have decorative stitches by the dozens.  This is an entirely different discipline than the new 'automatic' machines which will stitch your design for you.  I have no interest in those.  In the 70's and 80's there were many excellent books written on freehand embroidery by machine.  The best is Robbie Fanning's \\"Complete Book of Machine Embroidery\\".  You can still buy it used through Amazon's network.  It's the best, and at the same time you might want to also order her \\"Complete Book of Machine Quilting\\".<br /><br />I have owned many, many sewing machines, and believe me, you can indeed do machine embroidery on any machine that works!	2005-01-12

How interesting that as we look at the last century, President Coolidge has become a polarizing figure.  After smears from William Allan White, Arthur Schlesinger and others, Coolidge has finally merited re-evaluation.  While not an activist President in the vein of, say, Franklin Roosevelt, Coolidge was far from indolent or passive.  He gave more press conferences than any other, inaugurated the use of radio, and sponsored airplanes in the military.  However, it was indeed his belief that government should exist for the people, not the other way 'round.  Interestingly, he was the last President to refuse to have a telephone in the Oval Office--he considered it undignified.  He supported women's suffrage and his wife, Grace, was the first First Lady to smoke in the White House.  I have undertaken to read many accounts of Coolidge; he does remain a mystery to us in so many ways.  Regardless of the slant of the source, though, his deep sense of decency and honor in performing public service always shines through.  I'd recommend purchasing a copy of 'Grace Coolidge and Her Era' from 1962 to give a more human side to both the President and his wife.  Another characteristic of this man is that despite his reserve, his overriding love for his wife and sons remains there.  The heartbreak that he and Mrs. Coolidge endured with the needless death of their youngest son in the White House cannot be overstated.  Especially since we know now that the Staph. infection from which young Calvin died would nowadays have certainly not been fatal.  I think part of the reason the Coolidge times have become fascinating for those of us interested in history is the obscurity to which these years have been consigned.  The terms of FDR with his extensive radio and movie coverage has overshown the previous three Republican administrations, not by accident.  I have concluded that no one book can cover all the aspects of President Coolidge, and he deserves further reading.	2004-07-20

However, Susan Eisenhower has written a book of the same caliber.  Being born in 1955, I only vaguely remember when DDE was President, though I certainly remember when Ike died in 1969.  I had read so many unflattering things about Mamie, with the main exception being J.B. West's book of memoirs about being Chief Usher in the White House.  Mamie is largely forgotten nowadays, particularly in light of the Kennedy administration that followed.  What greater contrast than between the sixty-something Mamie and the thirty-something Jackie!  After reading this book in all its details, one can better understand that Mamie considered herself first, last and always as an Army wife.  It's easy for us to think of the period during and following WW II when Ike shot up through the ranks, with the perks that such a position brings.  This book reminds us of the many, many years of their marriage with constant moving and not enough money to go around.  Was it any wonder, then, that she would shop the newspapers for bargains while First Lady?  I think we all hope that by our sixties we have a good working conception of who we are and what we want--this Mamie had in spades.  She wouldn't change her hairdo or wardrobe for whims of fashion--she knew what worked for her.  We also might be reminded that the position of First Lady is indeed unpaid and she is truly under no obligation to perform for us, the American public.  In this book Susan Eisenhower reveals that in the eight years that Ike was President, Mamie only entered the Oval Office 4 times!  Now, that's what I can call a separation of duties.  We are also reminded that no President before or since had the foreign experience, including living in many foreign countries.  They were a most cosmopolitan couple, perhaps masquerading as our grandparents!  As West said, no couple looked more spit-and-polish than the Eisenhowers in their formality, and this included the Kennedys.<br />This is a must read for any fan of 20th century American history.<br />Many thanks to Ms. Eisenhower for her work.cluded the Kennedys.<br />This is a must read for any fan of 20th century American history.<br />Many thanks to Ms. Eisenhower for her work.	2004-07-20

I consider myself pretty neutral on Bill and Hillary, but this truly is a shameless advertisement for the two.  I was expecting more on the house itself, but basically this is a photo journey through the happier social moments during the Clinton presidency.  For this, I still consider the book documenting the Ford presidency to be far better, certainly more candid, and a better artistic statement.  The most interesting part of this book for me was the documentation of the planning for a state visit.  The recipes at the end of the book weren't very interesting.  Certainly, anyone curious about the internal workings of the House itself will be disappointed; JB West's &quot;Inside the White House&quot; is far better.  I'm unsure where this book should rest in anyone's library.  It could easily be considered fuel for the Clinton spin on their own celebrity.  I'm glad I paid only a few bucks for it as I'll have no problem getting rid of it.  Recommend looking elsewhere; the Natl. Geographic video on the White House is done much better.	2003-12-09

I must admit I became rather bored with the constant accounts of Mr. Kennedy's sexual addiction and his liaisons, and Mrs. Kennedy's method of distancing herself from them.  Too much like bad soap opera.  As one who lived through his administration, this book will read as revelation to those of a younger generation.  It truly was a different world then, journalistically.<br />This still reads as a rather sad sexual accounting of this period in our history.  Not a book I'd purchase for myself.	2003-11-30

I knew little about her prior to reading this, and the book filled in what I wished to know.  I was aware that her father was a mentor to Condy Rice and actually am interested in knowing more about him, now.<br />Actually, I wasn't aware on buying the book that there was so much focus on her Jewish relatives, and found myself relatively uninterested in Mr. Dobbs's efforts to inform the Secretary.  For every one of us interested in distant relatives of whom we know little, there is one of us who isn't.<br />This book was a pleasure to read even without the Secretary's co-operation.  However, for those interested more in her political development than her personal history, a look at other books would be suggested.	2003-11-30

This book certainly reminds one of Mrs. Daniel's mysteries.  I have read her various publications on her parents and I consider them to be better reads.<br />However, Mrs. Daniel does an excellent job of organizing her work, and the break-down of the chapters here is excellent.  I didn't read the book in order, but picked the chapters in which I was most interested first!<br />I'm a history reader, though, and found very little in this book that was news.  Save her personal recollections, I think I've seen this information elsewhere, and in greater detail.  The book is very 'readable', though, and I managed to polish it off in two evenings, easily.  This will likely broaden its appeal to its intended audience.<br />I can't say the book is a disappointment.  I didn't expect a more academic volume.  The expression 'history lite', used by Publisher's Weekly, is appropriate.  For those who ordinarily don't read history, it will be pleasurable.  For those of us who read history, a look elsewhere is recommended.	2003-11-30

I wonder whether the Hillary-haters actually bought the book or simply received their opinions from the vituperative conserative media hosts.<br />It is nearly impossible for Americans to remain neutral in their assessment of Mrs. Clinton.  Consequently, when any of us approach writing either by her or about her, we tend to bring our own preconceptions with us.  Of course, this is nothing new.  Conservatives railed about Mrs. Roosevelt to a degree that has still not been matched in more modern times.  The accusations that she and her husband were driving us into world socialism are well documented.<br />I found this book rather a boring read.  Mrs. Clinton is a very intelligent woman, but that doesn't make a book worth reading.  Yes, I consider it somewhat self-serving.  Why would anyone write a memoir that wasn't?  Mrs. Clinton delves somewhat into the whole sordid Lewinsky affair, but almost as if she were a member of the press corps, not the President's wife.  For this reader the account only reinforces that this was a rather distant marriage to begin with.  The political twist is nothing more than I would expect from any political partisan on either side of the aisle.<br />I still consider the gold standard in recollections of First Ladies to be Mrs. Johnson's \\"White House Diaries\\".  No other First Lady has accomplished this, and Mrs. Clinton hasn't either.  This book will probably only reinforce whatever political baggage each reader brings along.  As an entertaining read I have seen many better.	2003-11-30

They are distinctly different.<br />I have been enthusiastic about Robbie Fanning's sewing books since the first, 1980, edition.  Be sure and look up her books on machine embroidery--they're also the best and pre-date the 'lazy' method of embroidery by computer machine.<br />As the Fannings illustrate in these books, anyone can machine quilt.  There are few fancy color photos and many showing basic techniques, along with countless line drawings.  The strongest reason for purchasing either edition of this book is the obvious enthusiasm that Robbie Fanning communicates through her writing.  I haven't seen this style in any other machine books.	2003-10-04

Certainly the author dug up sufficient dirt on the subject to satisfy the most 'enquiring' minds.<br />As with another reviewer, I am still mystified as to what so many famous men saw in this women.  Not particularly attractive for most of her life, she apparently had a female magnetism that escapes the written page.  No surprise, many women have had that ability.  It doesn't read well for the male of the species, many of whom appeared as pawns to this woman's machinations.<br />Ultimately this is a rather depressing book.  Like others, Mrs. Harriman is in the end old, alone and a rather pitiful character. What a ride while it lasted, though!	2003-10-03

I don't share much of Dr. Rice's political philosophy.  However, she and I are the same age and I was interested in her background.<br />This book will serve as an adequate source of information for those, like me, mildly interested in Dr. Rice and her background.  In no way does this book cover the more private aspects of her personality or motivations in life.  Perhaps there's no way it could, being so contemporary.<br />Certainly the book documents Dr. Rice's life from her early days in a segregated society all the way to her appointment at the NSA.  After reading this book I can understand much better why she is so comfortable with the Bush and Cheney families.  She came from the elite black society of segregation, then moved into wealthy white society.<br />It is clear that Dr. Rice has been a person of discipline and achievement her whole life.  This book doesn't delve into her personal life; it's not one of those 'intimate' biographies at all.  In fact, the lack of insight into her personal life is rather noticeable, providing less information than the average biography.<br />This book could certainly serve as one of those quick-and-easy documents meant to fuel political campaigns.  It's a light and quick read, which is all I wanted on the subject.	2003-08-21

My background has been more heavily in applique and thread painting.<br />Like the excellent Alison Holt book on machine embroidered landscape work, Ms. Curran's art uses manipulation of the basic background prior to machine stitching.  However, rather than using only silk and dying it, she also uses cotton and some other fabrics and paints them rather than dying them.  She also uses application of multiple fabrics prior to stitching.  It appears that her technique is somewhat more flexible.<br />Regardless, the results are stunning.  Her techniques and works are shown to best advantage in the dozens of color illustrations throughout the book.  I've certainly spent more on books that have much less visual content.<br />This book will serve as an excellent primer and introduction to those interested in embroidery by machine.  It also demonstrates with clarity that a large financial investment in a computerized embroidery machine IS NOT at all necessary to produce artwork anyone would be proud to claim!	2003-08-21

I've been into freehand machine embroidery and thread painting for 20 years, using ordinary sewing machines.  I still don't see the attraction for the new embroidery machines, simply copying stuff off of a computer, but obviously everyone doesn't agree!<br />It is regrettable, though, that many younger or less-experienced sewers don't realize that there is a long and rich history of machine embroidery dating back into the 19th century, long before even zigzag stitching was available.  Expensive and complicated embroidery machines are NOT required to make beautiful and original artworks.<br />This fact is ably demonstrated in Ms. Holt's book.  She has a technique that is apparently more popular in Britain than here.  It involves coloring the background fabric-in this case dying silk-with a preliminary rough sketching of the scene.  This is followed by the appropriate stitching to make the scene.  I am new to this technique and have yet to try it.  However, it looks like it should be simple enough even for a non-painter like me to obtain good results.<br />One of the great attractions of this book, and one of the reasons it's worth its price, are the profuse color illustrations of her work, along with dozens of color photos of the techniques involved in its production.<br />I am looking forward to trying Ms. Holt's method for producing machine embroidered art.  This book should serve as a great illustration and instructional tool for those interested.	2003-08-21

This is certainly an area of photography unexplored by most.  Though I've loved photography for decades, until I found this book I hadn't given much thought to women of color who photographed.  When I think of difficulty that women such as Gilpin and Cunningham had in simply supporting themselves in the early days, how must it have been for these women, seemingly doubly handicapped!<br />One must respect the difficulty Mrs. Ashe encountered trying to uncover so many of the more obscure figures.  My favorites were the women who operated commercial photographic studios, taking all types of 'hack' photography.  Of course, we have now come to respect that type of photography as a form of documentary work, and some of these women did it beautifully.  'Tex', the military photographer, was another favorite.<br />Regardless of who you may find as a favorite of yours, as a work en toto this is a superb addition to any fan of photography.	2003-03-04

I found it to be a great travelogue and a lot of fun to read, with the author detailing her journey across various regions of Europe and Asia.  I've read other bicycle-touring books that seem to be focused as much on technical information and problems as the journey.  If that's the type of book one likes, this isn't it.  There is very little technical in the book; it focuses on the journey.  There's a little 'new age' style where the author speaks with her ancestors but it really doesn't shade the book as a whole.  I found it charming.<br />The most enjoyable aspect of this book, as opposed to so many other bicycling books, is that this author obviously was no jock trying to race against time, or anything else.  She was in her middle age, as I am.  She certainly didn't impress me as a world athlete, just a fairly ordinary person on a fairly extra-ordinary journey!<br />Easy, fun, and pleasant reading, recommended for all ages.	2002-09-04

There is not sufficient technical information for those seeking learning.  There are any number of other books on bicycling that explore the emotional/spiritual side better and in more depth.

Because of its depressed condition for decades in the past it was overlook even by Texans.  Today, however, we are able to see this area for what it is:  rolling hills, tumbling streams and rivers, and a great view around so many curves in its small secondary roads.  Though West Texas is well-known for Big Bend, the sheer area of this part of our State, combined with sparse population, means all of us can enjoy peace and solitude--this is where the South turns into the Southwest.<br />Mr. Ford's book reflects a love of the area, combined with excellent directions and documentation of sights.  The book is divided into geographic areas, and within those areas, into tours of a day or longer.  He has also done an excellent job of rating the difficulty of the tours, and why he has come to those conclusions.<br />Though I have only cycled a small amount of this area, I would also recommend this book for those who would like to tour by car.  I've traveled almost this entire area by car and wish I'd had this guide then. Additionally, I found the photography very well-done--particularly in view of the price of the book.<br />This book is a valuable resource, and a terrific buy for the price!	2002-05-26

I had the impression it was probably written in a week or less, once an outline was generated.<br />Fighting the 'bulge' in middle age, I found Mrs. Meyer's approach to eating and overeating quite simplistic.  We are still learning the root causes of obesity.  We can all state, 'eat sensibly and exercise more'; that's nothing new.  I can look in my Bible for all references to eating and gluttony; it wasn't a problem for society when the Bible was written.  As much as I love my Bible, it isn't a guidebook for controlling overeating, and neither is Mrs. Meyer's book.<br />This book would've worked better as a brochure at a fraction of this price.

Ms. Murphy's journey in the early sixties is, if anything, more fascinating to read today in light of the changes in the Middle East since she travelled there.  Her independence and cheerful acceptance of different cultures is refreshing.  This book was written prior to the 'me' decade, and while intensely personal, lacks the self-preoccupation that more recent writers practice.<br />Additionally, unlike so many bicycle travelogues, this book doesn't focus on the author's bicycle!

After release of the first volume it was easy to see why the Johnson family didn't support this effort.  I wasn't shocked or disappointed by Johnson's early life.  Like so many of the great achievers in our world, unhappiness and disappointment early in his life motivated and drove Lyndon Johnson to his great achievements later in life.<br />Like other reviewers, I waited so many years for this volume that I wondered whether it would ever be released.  Like another reader, I found I couldn't put the book down once I started it.  I already knew Caro was a master biographer, one who can make history 'live'.  This book is the best yet of the series.  Why?  Because by this volume's inception, Johnson was dealing with many other public figures well-known to readers.<br />Caro masterfully paints the portrait of both of our houses of Congress being ruled by lonely and eccentric bachelors who were persistently seduced by Lyndon Johnson, who didn't hesitate to use his family as a tool to further his influence with these men.  Caro accurately awards much credit for Johnson's success to the unfailing support of Lady Bird, who places LBJ and his comfort and goals ahead of their children.<br />This volume also illustrates in great deal how Johnson's ambition shaped Congress in a way that is still a great influence today.  One wonders where our Congressional structure would be today without his legacy there?<br />It is reinforced repeatedly in this book, as with the earlier volumes, that LBJ's core political beliefs are very hard to pin down.  However, if we look at most of our greatest political operators who reached the White House--including FDR and, more recently, Bill Clinton, this is a characteristic of all.  Strangely, many of our Presidents who have been downrated in history are those who have the most passionate beliefs and principles!<br />I did feel that Caro's handling of Johnson's weaknesses and liabilities was more even-handed than the earlier volumes.  However, this may be simply because LBJ was also gaining sufficient political power to demonstrate his 'mastery'.<br />Like another reviewer, I only hope Mr. Caro has the health and energy to finish this masterwork.Johnson's weaknesses and liabilities was more even-handed than the earlier volumes.

Therefore, I purchased this revision with interest in how the 'reading' had changed.  Though this is a very readable translation of the Bible, to me it lacks the passion of other translations, particularly the King James and New King James.  Like many others buying a new translation, I first leaved to many of my favorite passages in both the New and Old Testaments.  They just don't 'stick' with me like the KJV.  I prefer strongly the use of capitals when dealing with God and Jesus in the Bible; it is missing here and I'm not comfortable with it.<br />In short, this is an excellent translation and one to which I'll refer during study, but it could never be my favorite due to the dry nature of the translation.	2002-03-02

I have owned one version or another of the Chain Reference Bible since I was a teenager in the seventies.  My 'standard' Bible has been the large print KJV for many, many years and it remains the first Bible I pick up. I purchased the NIV Chain Reference, but just didn't like the translation, it just didn't 'read' right for me.  I've enjoyed the NAS translation, but it is awfully dry reading when the heart desires poetry.  So, I ended up purchasing the NKJV.  It has been a real pleasure to read, combining the elegance of the KJV with a modern and accurate adaptation.<br />As for the chain reference system used by Thompson, it's such a  part of my Bible reading and study that I'd have a really hard time switching to another system.  Some of the illustrations and charts have been revised from my older KJV, but not to an extreme.  The Thompson system remains, for me, the quickest and easiest way to study a topic through the Bible, or just through either the New or Old Testament. The Bible also includes an excellent concordance; for someone new to chain reference study they can start with the traditional concordance and work their way into the Thompson system.  Also included are excellent maps, revised from the earlier versions, and a historical dictionary with photos of significant Biblical locations, with explanations.<br />I agree with another reviewer that Nelson Bibles are, in general, not made for people with serious intentions on daily Bible use.  They are constructed down to a price, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as these can provide a very inexpensive introduction to the Bible.  However, when one is ready to use a Bible in a serious, daily way, a better Bible will easily pay for its higher price.<br />Though this Bible is well-made, it is NOT as well made as my older, large print KJV.  My older Bible has whipstitching clearly seen in front and back, with pages secured as well today as when I bought it.  This newer Bible appears to have pages that are glued in like cheaper ones.  Additionally, the paper is comletely different than my older edition, and thinner. The older paper had almost an eggshell texture, whereas the newer paper is much slicker and thinner. In first use it's really quite difficult to get the pages apart.  However, it's still a very well-made Bible, just not up to the standard of the older ones.  That should in no way deter someone from buying it, though.<br />As a one-volume Biblical library, I haven't seen anything to beat the Thompson's.  As another reviewer noted, it's also refreshingly free of editorial bias, which certainly can't be said of all its competitors.  Most of all, each of us needs to find a Bible they can live with daily, and any Bible available is better than none at all!

I've owned this book in one form or another since the book came out in the seventies.  There were many people out there who were interested in moving away from can opener cookery, but were intimidated by the average 'hippie' cookbook.  Mrs. Lewis, through her clear, excellent narrative and precise recipes, reminded many in the cities and suburbs of just how good fresh ingredients, prepared simply and with love, can elevate the eating experience to the sublime.<br />This is one of those special books combining two of my main reading interests:  American history and cooking.  Ms. Lewis has the book divided into chapters like meals; e.g. breakfasts, lunches and dinners, all occurring within the major season subheads.  This makes perfect sense after you read the book and understand her emphasis on eating by the season.  All Americans used to do this, but with modern transportation and food preservation, it doesn't exist anymore.<br />Over the past twenty-five years I think I've made just about every recipe in the book, and all of them can be recommended.  I am a fan of Southern cooking and hers is certainly authentic.<br />That this book is still available is testament to its worth.  It still makes for excellent reading and cooking, twenty-five years on.	2001-10-28

I first began reading about him coincident to my favorite president, Roosevelt.  It took time and a few books, but the more I read about Harry Truman, the more I admired.  We were suffering through the presidency of Jimmy Carter, who so many compared as a 'common man' to Harry Truman.  I soon learned that there was little in common between the two.  Though they shared a common distinct and deep sense of morality and right and wrong, Truman was a President who understand the necessity of compromise.<br />Mr. McCullough's book is as straightforward and understandable as his broadcasting.  I must confess, I didn't learn anything new about Truman from this book, but I'm not the average reader.  It really didn't matter anyway, because the writing is so enjoyable.  Truman was an accidental president, and one who so many thought not up to the job.  My parents used to tell me about the ridicule and scorn so many had for Truman, rather like the attitude toward Dan Quayle.  Time has reversed that, and it's freely acknowledged that anyone would have had a hard time following FDR!<br />Truman's tenacity and focus is nowhere better demonstrated than his relationship with his wife and her family.  Being upper-class, Bess's mother never considered Truman worthy of her daughter, even after he reached high public.  Bess's lack of political support for her husband is well documented.  Her dislike of D.C., manifested by returning to Independence at every possible opportunity, is also well known.  Somehow over the course of decades he was accepted into her family, though the Truman residence in Independence was actually the Wallace family home.<br />Time has served to enhance not only Truman's stature but to validate his decisions.  While lacking FDR's ability to mobilize and modify America's people, he proved a firm and resolute leader, and one for which right and wrong were more than mere words.<br />This is a tremendous book and would be a terrific introduction to President Truman and his times.his is a tremendous book and would be a terrific introduction to President Truman and his times.	2001-10-27

I have been a fan of the Roosevelts since I discovered them as a teenager thirty years ago.  I have read many, many books on them, most notably Burns's Roosevelt biography and the excellent set on Eleanor by Blanche Cook.  I have also read many books on the various political and social aspects of the Roosevelt years.  It was with great interest that I purchased this book when it was released.  I knew of Mrs. Goodwin from her work and subsequent book on President Johnson.<br />This book offers a unique perspective on the Roosevelts, namely their lives during the second World War.  While not a daily diary of their activities, the book succeeds in illustrating not only significant public appearances, but also routines in their daily lives.  Mrs. Goodwin has a particular talent for writing in a style that is extremely readable without being simplistic.  The overall writing style is sympathetic toward the Roosevelts without neglect of critism or their individual weaknesses.<br />This book was one of the very few I read that I couldn't put down until finished.  I have reread it, and loaned it out, so many times that I was forced to buy a second copy.<br />Mrs. Goodwin has the peculiar talent of making history 'live' through writing, in the same manner that Barbara Tuchman did.  This book is great reading for those who don't ordinarily like reading history.<br />I only wish Mrs. Goodwin would spend less time on television and more on writing books!	2001-10-27

I bought it not for the subject matter, but for his photography.  As an amateur for 30 years I know how hard it is to produce some of the photography shown in this book.<br />I notice the prior reviewer criticizes the book for not providing more history, etc. on diners.  If the book were misleading in its description or presentation I would agree.  However, it makes no such pretenses.  This is a photographic book, plain and simple.  Actually, those interested in diner history should look into the work of Richard Gutman on diners, which is comprehensive and an excellent companion to this volume.<br />It has been with this book that I've felt more closeness to the atmosphere of diners, because his photos provide not only a sense of spontaneity in the people, but also his use of lighting.  I particularly enjoy those photos where he has made no correction for fluoroscent lighting with his daylight film.  This lends a greenish cast to those photos, again enhancing the feel of spontaneity.<br />As stated above, this is an excellent photographic study of the American diner phenomenon.  Those looking for historical narrative can find that easily elsewhere.	2001-10-27

The recipes have all turned out as represented, with no failures so far.<br />My greatest pleasure with using this book is that these are indeed quintessential American desserts, as stated on the cover.  I get a kick out of some of the newer dessert books claiming to be American classics, but turn out to be made with whatever ingredient combinations happen to be in the current cooking magazines!  Nothing exotic here, and the only expensive items will be the nuts and possibly some spices not already on hand.  I consider this important in bake sale items, because I try to hold my cost per item down to a reasonable level.<br />I did read the one 'one-star' review from someone in Philly who stated these aren't really bake sale items and regretted lack of bake sale guidance.  Well, I've been baking for bake sales for many years now, for friends with various organizations, and I really have never seen a trend.  If I'm asked to bake, I just ask for a general idea of what they'd like to sell (i.e. cake, cookies, etc.) and then go on my own.  In fact, I just finished baking 3 cakes on a Halloween theme for a bake sale today.  So, I really don't see the point. . .<br />Anyway, these are treats that can be enjoyed by everyone, not just for bake sales.  A great book for the less-experienced baker and also a good gift idea!	2001-10-27

Massey Sr. Lectures in the History of American Civilization)	Books	5	35	36	N	Y	Autobiography, Welty Style	I've been a fan of Eudora Welty since discovering her short stories as a teenager many, many years ago.  I wrote her what is probably a typical teenager's fan letter, and she was kind enough to reply and answer some questions I had in detail.  I have since read all of her work, and still consider it a disgrace that she never won the Nobel Prize--she deserved it.<br />This little autobiography is a great read even for those unfamiliar with Miss Welty's work--it's that engaging.  As with her fiction, she is particularly adept at providing the atmosphere in the South where she lived her life.  By the time I finished reading of her childhood I felt like I had a true and realistic rendering of her family, told with the tenderness and dignity that marks all of her work.<br />I've always found Welty's friendship with Katherine Ann Porter to be an interesting facet of her early career, since Porter assumed the role of mentor.  Miss Porter was, and is, well known for her beauty and was a 'free spirit' when it came to lovers.  Regardless of her other attributes, there is no doubt that Eudora was quite ugly to look at, and certainly led a very different personal lifestyle than did Miss Porter.  I hope that one day a biographer will further detail their relationship.<br />As an aside, I have a dual-tape recording set of Miss Welty reading some of her short stories.  She had what must be one of the most pleasant and engaging reading voices I've ever heard.  If the reader ever has a chance to purchase her on tape, buy it.<br />I've long felt that Eudora Welty took on the title of the pre-eminent American female writer of the last century following the death of Willa Cather. This little jewel of a book will delight her old fans and possibly create some new ones.<br />A great gift idea for anyone enjoying biographies.	2001-10-27

LBJ was so complex, and so was his Presidency.  I've read many books on him and often get the impression given by the parable of the elephant and the three blind men:  each writer gives a part of the description of the 'elephant' that was Johnson, but no real complete picture.  Mr. Dallek comes closer, in my opinion, to representing the complete picture of Johnson and his Presidency, than others.  I've always viewed Johnson in the same mold as FDR, in terms of scope of personality and ability to place a personal stamp on his Presidency.  Both mean had such great assets and achievements, and both had great shortcomings.  The difference that comes to mind immediately is Johnson's lack of confidence in many judgments and life-long lack of self-confidence; this is well-illustrated in this book.  Unlike Roosevelt, Johnson lacked the ability to disguise his motives and emotions in an ongoing manner.<br />Like other reviewers, I only wish there had been greater coverage of Johnson's Vice-Presidential years.  I've never read any detailed history of this period in Johnson's life, other than the feuding with the Kennedy clan.  There's probably a book here for someone willing to spend the time and effort.<br />Dallek's writing is much more balanced than the books by Caro, and I think history will prove them of greater value.	2001-10-27

I bought this book from amazon based on reviews.<br />When it arrived I was delighted by the beautiful design of the book.  Through a combination of photography, graphics and printing, it succeeds in conveying the 'feel' of a diner to the reader.  For those, like me, who buy cookbooks to read as well as cook from, this one will be a treat.<br />The recipes are well laid out and detailed, with each receiving a short introduction.  The recipes are well-written and complete; after making about ten of the recipes I haven't noticed any missing ingredients or steps.<br />The difficulty factor changes quite a bit from recipe to recipe.  None are difficult to make, but some are more involved and require more time than others.  However, everyone will find items suited to their abilities, and may use the book for trying new techniques and more complicated recipes.<br />My personal favorite in the book is the recipe for 'High and Mighty White Cake'.  This recipe produces a beautiful cake suitable for any occasion.  I have used this cake, with various frostings, for a number of occasions and it has always gotten complements.  Her carrot cake recipe is also excellent.  The 'Old Time Peanut Butter Cookies' are also a great option, with just the right balance between sweet and salty.  The 'Classic Diner Cheesecake' is nothing unusual, but it does make an excellent cake.  As stated in the book, the 'Devil's Food Cake' is intensely chocolate for people into that, and I've had great results with her accompanying white frosting, and with chocolate frosting on it.  The 'Lemon Layer Cake' has become another favorite of mine and a hit with those for whom I've baked it, giving plenty of lemon flavor accompanied by a lemon-y frosting.<br />I haven't tried any of the puddings, etc., because they aren't what I like to make.<br />This book is an excellent buy for the money.  Though softback, the binding and cover are of particularly high quality, with the cover being a heavy plasticized paper. It will make a much-appreciated gift for any bakers on a gift list!ed paper.

After reading with fascination the prior forty-plus reviews, they would appear to fall into three categories:  juveniles who were forced to read the book for school, giving the book the lowest possible ratings.  PC-types who judge both the writing of the book and the actions and beliefs of the characters by today's standards--such smug intolerance!  Thirdly, those who love literature for its own sake, belonging to the community that has made this one of the classics in American writing.<br />I admit, I am part of the third group.  I fell in love with the writing of Cather as a teenager.  To date, I have found no other author who can illustrate the great expanse of America and the vision of our ancestors in the way she could.  Being set in New Mexico, the feeling of expanse of the American West permeates every page.  I agree with another reviewer that this book is the writing equivalent of O'Keefe.<br />While I can understand the young ones criticizing the book after being forced to read it, I don't understand adults who were dissatisfied.  Was this their first Cather?  Hopefully not (I'd recommend starting with &quot;Song of the Lark&quot; or &quot;O Pioneers&quot;.  Her writing is not an unknown quantity.<br />I've read the book many times over the past thirty years, and it's not a book for those who like to have their plots laid out for them.  The plot is obscure, as Cather leaves the main story line with chapters diverging like side trails off a main path.  Though not hard to read, it's not a book for those in a hurry.  It's best being read in a comfy chair on a rainy afternoon next to a window.  The sense of timeliness, of the stretching on into eternity, is seldom better conveyed than in this book.<br />A hundred-plus years on, Willa Cather's writing remains the foremost example of American Midwestern writing.  For those who love the narrative style, I'd recommend finding some of the writings of Sarah Orne Jewett, one of Cather's mentors.  You will see the origin of some of Cather's style.origin of some of Cather's style.	2001-10-25

This book was the first in the Agatha Raisin series from Ms. Beaton.  I found it browsing back in the mid-90's.  I've always been a fan of British mystery, but this is something else.  There have been some many Marple knock-offs, but early on the reader learns Ms. Raisin has little in common with Christie's heroine.<br />Writing with omniscience, we learn that Agatha Raisin has hidden a lifetime of hurt with a tough exterior and a razor-sharp tongue.  She has been able to submerge that inner pain under a hard-won career.  However, when she decides to sell her business and retire to 'the country', her sense of being an outsider comes back to haunt her.  She learns she wants to belong to the community of villagers among whom she lives, and learns she can't retreat to London.  Her efforts to assimilate into village life are the most humorous and touching parts of the book.<br />Of course, there is a murder woven into the book, along with a frustrated romance.  The plot is logical and the dialogue believable.<br />I've loaned this book to several non-mystery-readers over the years, and they've all loved it.  The inner vulnerability and self-criticism from which Agatha suffers is a universal theme.  I've read the rest of the Raisin books and have enjoyed them all, but none as much as this first effort.<br />For those who read this and like it, check out Beaton's other mysteries not featuring Ms. Raisin.  You'll like them, too!	2001-10-25

There is very little narrative.  Like another reviewer, I was quite disappointed that there was only a sketchy outlining of the various transitions that motels have progressed through over the generations.  I got the impression that Mr. Margolies probably had most of these old brochures, cards, maps, etc., and simply assembled these in a chronological format.<br />On the other hand, if you are a fan of Margolies's photography, his own photographs in the book match his earlier photographic achievements.<br />This book is probably worth the price of admission, but I'd like to see a more comprehensive history of twentieth-century hospitality industry.	2001-10-25

At that time, the vegetarian world was still considered exotic, with many people in this country refusing to believe one could eschew meat and survive.  We were heavily into protein combining; looking back on it now we can wonder what the problem was!  So many of the vegetarian books and cookbooks at that time combined the vegetarian diet with a heavy dose of whatever philosophies and religious beliefs and practices the author believed.  This drove many away from vegetarian practice.<br />Mrs. Cottrell's books are none of these.  They provide simple and easy-to-follow vegetarian recipes without a lot of extra baggage.  Being from Loma Linda University, I assume her basis for vegetarianism was religious, but as a nutritionist she also obviously had health reasons for vegetarianism also.<br />Also, a defect of so many of the earlier vegetarian cookbooks (and still found in some now!) was the inclusion and use of exotic ingredients that the average American either can't find locally or afford.  Mrs. Cottrell's recipes use everyday ingredients that we can all find in our grocery stores.  Coupled with that is the use of ordinary cooking methods, nothing strange to the average cook.<br />Another aspect of vegetarian cooking that Mrs. Cottrell stresses is its economy.  I've known many vegetarians who spent more on unusual and atypical ingredients than they would have for meat.  Not here.  I was in college at the time I bought this book, and was watching every penny.  This book is a great aid for economizing and still making healthy food.<br />This book has remained on my bookshelf for twenty-five years, and I'd recommend it for anyone interested in cutting down on their meat consumption, or becoming vegetarian.  I'd also recommend it for anyone interested in lowering their food bill, yet still eating well.	2001-10-23

Once again, Mrs. Birkby has hit a home run!<br />Mrs. Birkby was one of the 'radio homemakers' who broadcast recipes, tips and news to Iowa's rural housewives as well as writing a long-lived newspaper column.  Needless to say, after decades she had a very rich collection of recipes and local history to share.  This she has done in a book that is very well organized, easy to read, and involves the reader.  Having never read her column, I can assume this style is what endeared the author to generations of Iowans.<br />This book focuses mainly on the years Mrs. Birkby spent with her husband starting and maintaining an Iowa farm for 10 years following WW II.  It is broken up into chapters on topics such as 'Grocery', 'Milking', 'Stoves', etc.  Recipes in each chapter follow the narration.  I prefer this format for historical cookbooks, as it makes it much easier to leaf through and locate recipes.<br />I've tried several of the recipes, and all have worked well for me.<br />This book would have rated five stars for me, even if it hadn't had any recipes.  Mrs. Birkby's struggles to make a success of a small farm with her family make a valuable documentation of postwar rural life.  Reading her accounts, particularly of laundry, illustrates how far we have come as a nation with housekeeping.<br />Thank you again, Mrs. Birkby, for sharing your personal and professional history with us!	2001-10-23

Like other reviewers, I've heard of this establishment for many years, but have never been there.  I purchased this book based on the other reviews and ratings.<br />This is a beautifully written book, profusely illustrated with photographs and personal accounts of locals and boarders.  In addition, the recipes are written in a very clear and easy-to-follow style for the less experienced.  Most of these recipes exist in one form or another in other books of mine, but some of the seasoning combinations are unique.  I've always felt that good home cooking has that indefinable ingredient, some call it love, that raises ordinary ingredients to art.<br />However, I must agree with a prior reviewer about putting Jack Daniels in so many of the recipes.  From what I've read, Miss Mary didn't drink or use booze in her cooking.  So why put it in here?  I feel Jack Daniels hurt its credibility, and the credibility of the book, by doing this.  They couldn't be selling many extra bottles of whiskey by pushing it in these recipes.<br />I don't know whether this restaurant has made or lost money since its takeover by Jack Daniels.  Certainly, the distillery has performed a public service by maintaining this traditional establishment.  For that, I'm appreciative.<br />This book will make a good gift for someone, particularly someone who's a whiskey fan.  I have enjoyed it myself, with the above caveat.	2001-10-23

It is neither as large or as comprehensive, but is sufficiently complete to stand on its own.<br />The emphasis in this book is on economy in food preparation.  Unlike so many contemporary cookbooks, this book avoids the use of a bunch of processed foods combined into gooey and fat-laden casseroles.  I've found that so many of those 'economy' cookbooks actually end up costing quite a bit of money per serving!  Mrs. Cottrell's recipes and practices amply demonstrate that simple preparation of good, whole ingredients can make healthy and very inexpensive meals.<br />My copy is just about worn out, and it's a pleasant surprise to find that this vegetarian classic is still available.  I'm ordering a fresh copy, and would highly recommend it to others!	2001-10-23

Included are recipes from Dr. Carver.<br />In my opinion, the greatest disappointment with this book is its incomplete documentation of the rest of the recipes.  Where did they come from, or from whom?  In a book that blends recipes with history, this is a significant flaw.  Certainly, some of the recipes, such as Guacamole dip and El Paso cheese dip, don't sound authentic to Tuskegee.  Again, who knows?  Historical collections of recipes should credit these recipes to someone, or simply state that a recipe is 'traditional'.<br />I buy cookbooks to read as much as cook from.  This book is organized with narration in italics mixed with the recipes.  For me, it makes the book more difficult to read.<br />(...)	2001-10-23

I have bought many, many cookbooks not for cooking, but for reading.  My favorite format in cookbooks are those where text is woven with recipes; it 'fleshes out' the recipes.<br />Anyone who has derived pleasure from reading the Foxfire series over the years will also want to buy this one.  It follows the general Foxfire format, specialized for cooking.  It will be of particular value for those young people interested in cooking.  As becomes apparent,  cooking in this country used to be quite different from what we consider it now.  For most Americans, by the end of WW II kitchens had been transformed by the addition of running water and gas/electric powered appliances.  My grandparents didn't get electricity in their rural location until 1948.  Before then, there was a kerosene-powered refrigerator, gasoline-powered washer, and wood stove.  It took longer for many in the Appalachian region, and 'old' cooking methods continued to be used.  Fixing chicken, for example, meant killing and plucking, not going to the grocery store!<br />History always becomes more immediate when it can be related to 'real' people.  The characters in this book come to life with the sensitive narration, and only grow in depth with re-reading.<br />I've tried some of the recipes in this book, especially those related to baking.  All have worked well.  Mere recipes, though, can't communicate the commitment and love that these people have given to their efforts.<br />This is a great book to read, and a good pathway to cooking methods of our ancestors.  Comprehensive, and an excellent buy!	2001-10-20

I follow these threads because I've made some delightful finds that way.  I'd never have known this book existed, had it not shown up under another book.  I consider this the closest thing I can do to browsing in a 'real' store.  Thank you, Amazon!<br />I occasionally come across a book covering something about which I know nothing.  Other than hearing of Mary Margaret McBride's show during the Depression, I knew nothing of these local radio pioneers, sending news, advice and recipes to small towns and rural areas alike.  Radio is still the most democratic of our media, accessible to anyone for pennies, and still a vital force in many third-world countries.  We used to have radio that encompassed far more than just news and talk-radio; people expected more from the radio back then, and they got it.<br />The book is broken up into chapters covering the careers and recipes of women broadcasting from KMA radio in Iowa.  There is no doubt that the part of a farm housewife could be lonely, and these radio programs would have provided good company.  We have no true equivalent today; these broadcasters usually knew their audience personally, and vice versa.  Into the sixties, these women broadcast their programs from their own homes, often from the kitchen, where they'd make recipes while giving them out over the air. Most of these women had an 'open door' policy where any listener coming through town could stop by their home and have refreshments without notice!  Who would, or could, do that nowadays?<br />The recipes are excellent.  I've made a dozen of them and all have worked well.  My favorite so far is Jo Freed's carrot cake; unlike many, it's subtle with the spices and makes a large, juicy sheet cake.<br />Truly, though, it's the stories of the women working as 'radio homemakers' that makes the book.  Most of these women were working because they had to, and mainstream broadcasting was still unheard of for women.  Therefore, these women made successful careers appealing to women.<br />The author was herself a well-known broadcaster and brings personal knowledge of the other radio pioneers to add texture and substance to the book.  It is beautifully written in a straightforward and informal style.<br />I appreciate the author documenting a small, but important, part of American history before all the radio homemakers are gone.  Her book is valuable and engaging reading, even without the excellent recipes.sting was still unheard of for women.

Some of the books available are written either by those who haven't 'walked the walk' or who have tried updating or otherwise modifying the food we grew up with and loved.<br />No so Ms. Lundy.  She gives us the real thing, take it or leave it, with recipes from her own cooking experience.  No, not all of these recipes are 'health food' in today's atmosphere of cooking-political correctness.  However, these recipes need no apology.  As Julia Child has always said, eat everything wisely and in moderation and you won't go wrong.  I'd classify much of this book as comfort food, and besides, stress is killing more of our baby-boomer generation than food ever could!<br />Interspersed with her recipes are delightful recollections, many of well known personalities.<br />Buy this book and enjoy her writing as well as her recipes!	2001-10-16

Maida Heatter is one of those cookbook writers who is as enjoyable to read as to cook from.<br />I consider this book the diametric opposite in style to Bevelyn Blair's cake book, which is also a great book.  Whereas Blair's book is sleek and substantial with virtually no 'fat' in the writing, Mrs. Heatter has a story to write about each of her recipes.  For those who only want the recipe, no brag, just fact, buy Blair's book.  However, if like me, you enjoy learning some background on a recipe, this book is up your alley.  Mrs. Heatter freely admits mistakes and trials leading to the recipes, and I suggest the buyer take those to heart.  Like another reviewer, I've tried tweaking some of her recipes, to my regret.  She has obviously worked long and hard on these recipes and has perfected these through trial and error.<br />Many of the cake recipes in this book involve several steps, and can get quite complicated, especially for a novice cake baker.  This is where Mrs. Heatter really shines.  Her instructions are explicit and detailed.  Few things are more frustrating than receiving a new recipe where the instructions leave the baker guessing steps.  Not a problem with Mrs. Heatter!  Though some of the instructions will be redundant to the experienced baker, I think it's much better to get too many instructions than too few!<br />The English Madeira cake is a jewel, possibly the best all-around pound cake I've ever baked.  Her 'best damn lemon cake' is awesome in its overwhelming lemon-y flavor, a golden jewel that's certain to fly off your serving plate.<br />Mrs. Heatter also recommends having a stand mixer with two bowls and sets of beaters (she's a Sunbeam user).  I'd recommend the same for these recipes--two bowls will cut down on the rather long preparation times.<br />Also--use bread crumbs like she recommends rather than flour for pan prep.  It really does work, and work well.<br />In summary, this can be a great book for the novice cake baker wanting to learn technique, as well as the more experienced baker wanting to try new flavors.  Her accessible and reader-friendly writing style completes a delightful bookoes work, and work well.<br />In summary, this can be a great book for the novice cake baker wanting to learn technique, as well as the more experienced baker wanting to try new flavors.

Remembering Brooklyn With Recipes and Memories from Its Favorite Restaurant	Books	5	20	21	N	Y	Read it for Fun, Read it for Recipes	I've never been to Brooklyn and was unfamiliar with Junior's until I bought this book through Amazon.<br />First, I'd like to complement the designer of the book.  It's colorful, well organized and fun to read!  Too often, cookbooks designed with 'style' become either hard to read or hard to find recipes within.  This book has balance.<br />I didn't buy this book to cook from, I was more interested in the history of the restaurant.  The story, beginning with Enduro in the pre-war years, is beautifully written and a joy to read.  I've passed it around to several friends who enjoyed it as much as I have.<br />I've tried a number of the recipes and they are good, though not truly exceptional.  I didn't find this surprising, as often restaurant recipes don't translate well to home cooking.  Also, we can't discount the value of restaurant atmosphere.  I'm certain an institution like Junior's can enhance a simple glass of milk with atmosphere!<br />And, no, the cheesecake recipe given in the book didn't impress me.  I read in another review that this isn't the same as the one at the restaurant and I can believe that.  It simply isn't anything special.<br />Regardless, this is a fun book, full of nostalgic good feelings, and I'm glad I bought it.  Certainly, should I get up to Brooklyn, this restaurant will be one of my first stops!	2001-10-16

I've enjoyed their books on all sorts of different subjects, not only their food books.  Therefore, I picked this book up without even looking inside.<br />What I found in this book, more than new material, was the impression that this was a book made up on short notice out of the Sterns's existing files.  It was neither as comprehensive or descriptive as earlier food reviews.  Certainly nowhere near as comprehensive as Road Food, sort of like a little abridgment.  Additionally, a bunch of the eating places in the book aren't in business anymore.<br />I'm looking forward to trying the fried chicken recipe given in the review of the Bon Ton Mini Mart, but this book left me feeling like a hungry man on a diet--satisfying somewhat, but left feeling like something was distinctly missing.  I really got the impression that this was a 'quickie', and not up to the standards of their other books.<br />I love reading the Sterns, and seeing them on TV, and hope this isn't the beginning of a trend.	2001-10-16

I thought the price was somewhat steep, until I received the book.  The construction is first-rate, the paper is heavy and rich in texture.  I've paid much more for much less.<br />I must disagree with the previous reviewer:  these are NOT ordinary young men you'd just pass on the street.  All of these are head-turners in their way.  Some have an androgynous beauty peculiar to developing men, so much so that it's a shock to see a set of male genitalia a little below!<br />Perhaps we've gotten so accustomed to seeing the pumped-up physique that these photographs are an anti-cliche.  The nude men in this book fit the 'swimmer' build that so many find erotic:  very slim, narrow in torso and hips.  Almost every model in the book has large genitalia, accentuated of course by the small body builds.  There are a few celebrity photos:  Chris Atkins, still looking buff in his middle age.  More particularly, Alexis Arquette, whose sexual endowment has been noted in his movies.<br />Fortunately, Gorman has not forgotten the subject and purpose of his photographs.  The nude men here are the stars, little distracted by manipulation of backgrounds or techniques.  Once again, his models are the stars here.<br />This is a highly erotic book for those attracted to young male beauty, and an excellent buy besides.	2001-01-24

I will echo the enthusiasm of the other purchasers of this book.  Don't be fooled by the small size of the book; it is chock-full of recipes.  The price per recipe must be lower than any other cake book I own!  In general, the recipes are very well written, all business and no fluff.<br />My only reservation would be giving this book to the cook without cake experience.  I've got 25 years' experience in cake baking, so explicit techniques that are taken for granted here needn't be elucidated.  For a beginner, though, the techniques of stirring vs. beating vs. whipping vs. folding, etc., might be unfamiliar.  For those cooks, I'd still recommend Marion Cunningham's Fanny Farmer Baking Book.<br />However, for someone who already knows how to bake cakes, this could be a most valuable reference, possibly the only all-cake book they'd need.  It'll also make a fine gift!  The beautiful retro-graphic design of the book is an added pleasure.	2001-01-06

The recipes I've tried out of this new book have worked as well as their original cookbook.  Actually, I didn't notice that these recipes are supposed to be 'healthier' until I began to write this review!<br />I've particularly enjoyed the black-eyed pea soup, the mustard greens and potato soup, and the collard greens and turkey wings. The pound cake recipe is standard, but the pear upside-down cake is terrific.  The banana oatmeal cookies will be a hit for you. The chicken broccoli casserole is yummy!<br />I could go on, but I'll just say that every recipe I've tried has worked well.  This is good home-style cooking, nothing too fancy, and the recipes are well written.<br />However, it's the stories and parables running through the book that make it special.  I've always been a fan of Ms. Bethune, and the narratives here about her are particularly enjoyable.<br />This book is not only excellent, but it's also an excellent buy!	2001-01-01

Julia Child as a personality has long been melded with Julia Child, the cook.  I watched her shows in the sixties as a child having little interest in the kitchen, but simply finding her fascinating to watch!  'The French Chef', unlike the Galloping Gourmet and others, has aged well and can still be watched with enjoyment.  Why?  Because Julia Child was always herself on TV, never pandering to the transient and fickle tastes of the times.<br />Watching Julia's various series, I learned some about her life, but eagerly purchased this book when it first appeared.  Unlike some other reviewers, I delighted in this auther's literary painting of the times in which Julia has lived.  To me, nothing is more disappointing in a biography than the feeling that something has been left out!<br />This book demonstrates that though her name to the public has been made by her cooking career, Julia Child is much, much more.  For those who enjoy reading biographies, this will provide enjoyment regardless of whether they like cooking or not!	2000-12-31

I wasn't new to cooking then, but I sure hadn't seen devices like he showed in that book!  I fell in love with it then, over the next 20+ years purchased some of the equipment in there, and wondered if there would ever be a followup.<br />Well, here it is, and it is as inclusive as the original!  Unlike a prior reviewer, I enjoy reading about the arcane and unique pieces made for cooking.  I don't want a book of this scope written like Consumer Reports.  In the first place, even Consumer Reports' product evaluations are usually subjective.  Plus, their prices aren't accurate.  Yes, I rather wish Mr. Wolf had at least given some range of prices for items in the book. However, I don't consider it a real drawback, as prices do vary enormously even on the web.<br />I found the recipes and other inserts pleasing and practical.  The color photos were also welcomed for this edition.  There is literally no way to cover all kitchen products on today's market, but Mr. Wolf goes further than anyone else I've seen in trying.<br />I tend to be a kitchen gadget and utensil freak anyway so this book is right up my alley.  Otherwise, and particularly for the novice in cooking, I have doubts about its utility.	2000-12-23

My primary interest is in the pound cakes and angel food cakes; I've made all of these.  In particular, the fresh raspberry and the lemon-vanilla cakes have turned out extremely well.  In the pound cakes, I had the best result with the sour cream/chocolate chip and the soaked orange cakes.  I've also made almost all the chiffon recipes, with the best reslts with the orange-and-lemon and the chiffon spice cakes.<br />This book has detailed instructions to accompany the recipes, making it easier for beginners to follow.  Too often, smaller books such as this will sacrifice instructions for saving space, and this one doesn't.<br />My only disappointment is the quality of the book itself.  There are no photographs, and the quality of the paper and binding don't bode well for heavy use.  I plan to transcribe a few recipes out into the computer and the book won't be used again.  The recipes are a good buy for the book's price, though.  Just don't expect to hand this volume down to your children!	2000-12-16

Though never having owned an Airstream, I've always been interested in its development and history as the 'Cadillac' of travel trailers.  This book was, for the most part, a disappointment.  I was primarily interested in the trailers themselves.  There are very few illustrations of floor plans over the years, of the development of the interiors and exteriors--after all, today's trailers are quite different from 40 years ago!  A great deal of space is dedicated to a few Wally Byam caravans with some large, page-filling photos.<br />In the end, this can make a nice coffee-table book for Airstream fans.  I'd still like to see a more comprehensive research into the trailers themselves and their development.	2000-12-11

Reading her biography many years ago, I learned of her pride in her cooking.  I didn't even know she'd issued a cookbook until I came across this edition!<br />Upon reading the book I was immediately reminded of the &quot;Alice B. Toklas&quot; cookbook.  The structure and literary emphasis are much the same.  Thus, for the same reason, it's a joy to read even if one doesn't cook!<br />However, like &quot;Toklas&quot;, the recipes are also a treasure.  Many of the recipes contain ingredients too exotic for the average cook, but many more are easily prepared.  This can also be a pleasurable and valuable resource for those, like me, who enjoy reading and preparing recipes from old cookbooks.  Our eating styles have changed enormously in the nearly sixty years since Rawlings wrote this book.<br />If you are a fan of Rawlings, buy the book whether you ever plan to cook any of its recipes.  Its reasonable cost is a further bonus!	2000-12-11

I bought this book off of Amazon, never having seen it in the stores.  What a pleasant surprise!  I'd expected another book of soul-food, Southern cooking (which is what I was looking for).  Ms. LaBelle's book has plenty of down-home-type recipies familiar to those of us in the South, such as her pot roast and her Southern fried chicken, but also has recipes that reflect a wider, more modern cooking trend, such as Caribbean fish steaks and shrimp fried rice.  Her Macaroni and Cheese recipe is to die for!<br />Unlike so many other 'celebrity' cookbooks, the recipes here are well-written and easy to follow.  I've cooked a couple of dozen recipes here, and all have worked as published.<br />This cookbook can be a terrific introduction to Southern cooking as well as an illustrated biography of its author.  I've been a fan of LaBelle for many years and was delighted to read her autobiographical segments.  This book is a great blend of cookbook and memoirs, and can be enjoyable even if only for reading!	2000-12-11

For years, I used it mainly to cook beans, due to its speed.  I bought this book when it was first issued and have referred to it countless times, since.<br />Pressure cookers today are indeed different than the earlier models (including my old Mirro).  With my old cooker, even though I never had an accident, I had to stay close at hand to monitor the pressure regular rattling, etc.  Pressure cooking with a modern cooker is so much easier!  My latest purchase, earlier this year, was an electric, programmable cooker from Salton that's as easy to use as my rice cooker or Crock Pot.<br />It's true that some of the recipes in this book use ingredients that are not freely available in non-urban areas of the country. No problem:  just adapt to what you want to cook!  I read a review by a prior person who lamented that they must be a 'meat and potatoes' person.  Fine:  do your meat and potatoes here!  I find that baked potatoes are much more delicious done in the cooker than in the microwave.  The time required is rather a split between nuking and conventional baking.  Pressure cooking can do wonders on tough meat the same way that a Crock Pot can. Just be sure and brown your meat first!<br />However, I still use my cooker more for beans than anything.  Sass gives a full and careful explanation of bean and legume cooking here, as safety must be considered.<br />Since this book came out several other cookbooks have been released on pressure cooking.  I've bought some, and the best alternative to this book is the one published by Presto, the maker of the original pressure cooker.  It's an excellent reference also, and also recommended.	2000-12-10

I'd be inclined to classify this book as a bar reference rather than a food book.  Again, the ones I've made have tasted great as mixed drinks.  Just don't plan to use these recipes as meal replacers!<br />Most of the ingredients are available in urban areas.  The expense per drink is more comparable, again, to mixed alcoholic drinks than the meal replacer type of smoothie.<br />This can be an excellent reference for someone wanting to go beyond daquiris and pina coladas into more exotic bar drinks.  Buy as a bar reference, not for your children!	2000-12-10

I have worn out my cassette set of this performance, and am ordering another.  Thich Nhat Hanh has remained the most accessible of the Buddhist teachers for many, many years now.  For those who have only read his books, I would recommend purchase of these tapes.  His voice on tape completes the efforts of his writing.  It is a set to be returned to many times (that's how I've worn mine out!).  I've found this set particularly enjoyable listening while driving.  As usual, Hanh's parables help to make the complex, simple.<br />Another virtue of this series is the illustration of Hanh's sense of humor!<br />Though revered around the world, Hanh's humility and pleasure in interacting with people shines through on this series.  It is obvious that he is the diametrical opposite to those religious teachers/leaders who set themselves above their followers.<br />This tape series can serve as an excellent introduction to Thich Nhat Hanh's work, and hopefully would lead to exploring his large anthology of written work.	2000-12-10

When he resigned from the Clinton White House I was one of those eagerly awaiting his book.  I wasn't disappointed.  Certainly some of my impressions of the Clinton style of governing were verified.  I'd always felt that this was an administration that governed through reaction rather than an organized agenda.  This appeared to be a function of not only Bill Clinton's personality but also of Hillary's.  There was no doubt that Pres. Clinton used (and uses) an unusual personal magnetism to substitute for a coherent set of objectives.<br />I found this book refreshing because Stephanopoulos refrains from being overly self-serving.  So many of these tell-all White House memoirs have appeared to serve as an ego-booster for the author.  I don't sense this slant at all.  Mr. Stephanopoulos has been honest about his own ambitions, lending a qualifying air to his writing.<br />This book further illustrates that taking a White House job of significance can consume a worker's entire lifestyle.  One expects the President to live his job, but what of the inner circle staffers who are quickly forgotten to history, and to us? As with other books, this volume once again testifies to the seductiveness of power, and access to that power.<br />In the end, it remains a very enjoyable and readable book, being sufficiently gossipy without being bitchy.  It will make good reading regardless of the reader's political persuasion.	2000-12-10

This is a very convincing argument for responsible eating.  Her book was the first to my knowledge that explicitly set out how what we eat in this country affects others abroad.  The most frightening aspect of our meat-eating habits then, as now, was the deforestation of huge tracts of land to make more room for raising meat sources.<br />Additionally, this book opened my eyes to the difference between subsistence living in 'third world' countries, as opposed to poverty in those same countries producing goods for Americans.<br />This book is literate and convincing for those willing to open their minds to a different world view.  It's 'in your face' without being 'down your throat'.	2000-12-10

Grinding my own grains and baking has been a hobby for twenty-five years.  I've never come across a book as well suited to a beginner.  I wish it had been around when I started!<br />There are many whole-grain baking books out there.  So many of them are too radical for the average person.  I've had books that state that only sourdough can be used for leavening, that baking powder and yeast are 'dishonest'.  I've had books that categorically state that the only way to produce whole grain flour is by stone mill or grinder (not true).  I've had books that use esoteric ingredients for bread not available to the average home cook.<br />Laurel eschews dogmatic arguments about whole grain baking.  She acknowledges that we all have busy daily schedules with families and work.  Better than any whole grain book I've seen, she illustrates that whole grain baking can become an integrated part of a working person's life.  Her recipes, particularly those for daily loaves, are reliable.  As she states, in the 'old' days some of our loaves would work, some wouldn't.  We've learned better, and she illustrates how.<br />In addition to her recipes, the writing style of the book reminds me of 'Laurel's Kitchen', her all-around vegetarian cookbook.  For the beginner, there is a very useful guide to the different ingredients of bread, and the different utensils and appliances available.<br />Several years after its release, this cookbook remains the most practical and useful guide to whole-grain cooking.  Highly recommended.	2000-12-10

This book breaks simplification of one's life into literally thirty days, almost like a diet book.  That is its greatest merit.  It appears to be guided more toward women, and toward women with families, than the rest of us.  Perhaps those women buy most of these books!<br />Having said that, the information contained is applicable to all of us.  I found myself gleaning ideas and concepts from the book, rather than following it verbatim.  However, I loaned it to my sister (who is a working mom) and she followed the steps to her satisfaction!  So, this book is useful on more than one level.<br />Don't purchase this book expecting some deep philosophical or religious discussion of simplification.  That is for others to do (see my review of &quot;Choosing Simplicity&quot; by Linda Pierce.  This is for someone who may not have the time or inclination for that type of writing, but simply wants some practical help cleaning up the messy corners of their daily life.	2000-12-10

I liked that one, so I bought the smoothie book when it came out.  As a believer in the power of juice consumption, I found this book to be an excellent reader also.  This is more than another 'fun' smoothie book for those looking for entertainment.  It's broken down by chapters into &quot;Energizers&quot;, &quot;Power Makers&quot;, &quot;Calorie Burners&quot;, &quot;Immunizers&quot;, etc., in its 11 chapters of recipes.  Specific ingredients for specific goals.  The explanations of ingredients needs are excellent, as they were in her juicing book.<br />One caveat:  don't expect all the recipes in this book to be low-cal, as they aren't.  Tahini and peanut butter are two common ingredients.  That may or may not be important to the reader.<br />Another caveat:  depending on where the reader lives, some of the ingredients may be difficult or impossible to buy in smaller areas.  E.G. flaxseed and other uncommon oils, algae, and a number of vitamin powders.<br />For those who want health information as well as smoothie recipes this makes an excellent book for reading, and deciding applicability to one's own health goals.	2000-12-10

I've bought several books on smoothies over the years, but this was the least useful to me.  Far too many of the recipes are made from ingredients either too exotic for me to find, or so expensive that the drink is more than a meal!  Of course, I should've know better; smoothies are best when they are simplest.  One good, basic book of recipes will put someone on the right path, then they explore.  I'd consider that, as a whole, these are for the outer limits of exploration!<br />On the other hand, never have I seen drinks photographed so well!  As an avid amateur photographer for many years, I found myself more interested in the setups for the photos than the recipes.  Make this book a larger format and it'd be perfect for guests to look at while waiting for dinner!  Kudos to the food stylist.<br />As with a prior reviewer (eric), this is not a book I would have bought had I come across it in a regular bookstore.  I could have seen the recipes and known it wasn't for me.<br />If someone is looking for smoothies 'on the edge', this may be the book for you.  If someone is looking for a basic book on making smoothies, look elsewhere.	2000-12-10

There were also a lot of cookbooks issued, the best of which was Mable Hoffman's &quot;Crockery Cooker&quot; by HP Books. Then, in the eighties and into the nineties, everyone seemed to forget about the poor old Crock-Pot as we whizzed our way through food processors and convection ovens.<br />Surprise!  Crock-Pots are back, better than ever.  The least glamorous kitchen appliance can also be the most-used, and this cookbook illustrates how.  It is especially useful for those young people not previously exposed to the principles and advantages of slow cooking.  Slow cooking can do wonders for the cook on a tight budget as well as the cook with little time to play in the kitchen.  Additionally, many believe that the lower cooking temperatures generated in a Crock-Pot can help preserve vital nutrients in the cooked foods over higher-temperature methods.<br />Like many other excellent cookbooks, this book can be used as a starting point, a springboard from which the curious cook can adapt and modify to suit particular ingredients.  Like all kitchen appliances, the Pot must be used enough, with enough recipes, and then knowledge will foster respect.	2000-12-10

Having given several copies of this as gifts, some Christians view any other religious writings with skepticism.  Like so many of his works, this book by Hanh is valuable to people of any belief.  The principles and practices he espouses are applicable to any religion.  Hanh extends the principles of mindfulness and 'monkey mind' to everyone.  My Christian friends who have read this have found it valuable in aiding their own efforts at quiet contemplation.<br />Regardless of its utility, it is also a 'feel good' book.  It would be hard for anyone to read this with an open mind, and not come away with a feeling of refreshment and cleanliness.  Of course, this is truly common to all of Hanh's more ecuminical writings.  Hopefully, this book will serve as an invitation to explore more of his work, and to learn more of his remarkable life.	2000-12-10

I've given several copies of that book to friends and family.<br />However, many people will find that, while they can support and agree with the principles that Dominguez and Robin publish, the practice of those principles as laid out in the book don't fit their chosen way of life.<br />That's where this book comes in.  It is a gentler illustration of many of &quot;Life's&quot; principles.  Its value is in the narration of families' applications to different ways of life.  As other reviewers have noted, choosing simplicity need not be a 'return to nature' movement or the adoption of practices impractical for so many families.  Many of us earn our living doing things we already love, with no need to 'retire' to voluntarism.  Plus, it should be remembered that choices available to single people are not necessarily proper for those with family responsibilities.<br />This book is indeed the proper followup to the Dominguez/Robin book.  In the future, if I make that book a gift, this book will accompany it.	2000-12-04

Gluten has been a well-kept secret of certain religions and peoples of our society.  It is finally coming into the light in today's health-conscious society.<br />With quality whole wheat available now to anyone with a postal address, the technique of cooking with gluten, either as a meat substitute or a meat filler, can be practiced by everyone.  I first discovered gluten in the seventies in a Magic Mill Mormon cookbook.  As the making of gluten is fairly time-consuming, I learned to make a lot at a time and storing it for future use.<br />I have made countless meat dishes with either only gluten or gluten and meat, and most people wouldn't realize any difference!  I hope shoppers aren't deceived by the idea that most recipes available are Oriental; gluten can be used by everyone.  Certainly, the making of gluten can be easier using a large mixer, but can actually be done by the strong of hand.<br />Highly recommended book, an excellent resource!	2000-12-04

Blenders were the Cuisinarts of my parents' generation, and were the standard wedding present of the fifties and sixties.  There were several excellent blender cookbooks from that period, that can still be found easily in used book stores for a song.<br />However, like the microwave oven fad and the Cuisinart boom, the attempt back then was to make the blender a 'do-all' appliance.  Many of the tasks and recipes from these old books took far more time than doing them by hand!<br />Time has rolled back around, and the blender is again being recognized for what it does best.  The current craze for smoothies has demonstrated the blender's worth in every kitchen. However, the blender can still do so much more:  flawless mayonnaise, fresh salad dressings where you can choose your level of fat, the smoothest and creamiest sauces possible, terrific, quick and easy pancakes and waffles.<br />Ms. Karoff has issued a book emphasizing the blender's strengths in today's kitchen and has left out many of the silly and wasteful techniques of the 'old generation' blender books.  There is enough that a blender can do, that will ensure its worth for today's cooks.  Today's low cost appliances are an additional blessing.  Plus, many of today's blenders have an accessory chopping bowl that will function as a mini-processor.<br />Nitty Gritty Cookbooks have always been an excellent low-cost resource.  This book is yet another winner in their library.	2000-12-04

I purchased this book expecting not only many more recipes than were provided, but I also found the recipes presented were not particularly helpful.<br />This seems almost like an unfinished project rushed to print.  In its totality it is closer to those 'theme' cookbooks you can find in tourist traps.  It's certainly not worth the price!	2000-12-03

As an ardent admirer of FDR and the New Deal, I'd never read any more on Coolidge than his &quot;Keep Faith in Massachusetts&quot;.  This book didn't change any of my major beliefs about Coolidge, but certainly filled in countless details about his life and work.  I admire Mr. Sobel's efforts to make a readable book despite the lack of Coolidge's papers.  <br />As is ably demonstrated, Mr. Coolidge was popular as much for what he was as for what he did.  His integrity and moral rectitude served him so well in those pre-TV times.  A man such as this would stand no chance in today's prettified, telegenic politics.  <br />Mr. Sobel is able to illustrate the injustice done to the memory of President Coolidge as being cold and remote.  Mr. Coolidge was a child of his time, region, and upbringing.  His deep love for his family is refreshing.  <br />This eminently readable book will give great enjoyment to those interested in Presidential history.	2000-12-02

It is fascinating that John XXIII, in his short tenure as Pope, appears today to have influenced the world of his faith more than either his predecessor, Pius (Pacelli), or his successor, Paul (Montini).  These were both highly political leaders with failings common to all politicians, religious or secular.<br />John XXIII had no political axe to grind.  By his very nature and the fact that he was expected to be a 'caretaker' he was uniquely able to bring his church into the twentieth century.  Some have alleged that through his actions he may have saved the Catholic church for the twenty-first.<br />This is a unique book, for it demonstrates a man of humility without excessive self-righteousness.  His love for God and for his fellow man are demonstrated in equal measure.  As some have said of John Paul II, John XXIII 'humanized' the papacy.  That he was able to do this without diminishing the authority of his office was part of his genius.<br />As a previous reviewer noted, I agree that John's work in areas not dominated by Roman Catholics appears to have widened his world, perhaps laying the groundwork for his later ecuminical progress.<br />This is a memoir that doesn't require one to be a Roman Catholic to enjoy, and to admire.  Holiness through living rather than platitudes.  Very highly recommended to anyone!	2000-12-01

I bought this book several years ago when it was first published. I have worn out the original and have purchased another copy.  Bread has been a hobby of mine for about twenty years, yet I learned new techniques from this book.  My favorite recipes in here are the Irish quick bread (great for making and taking to work) and the Granny Smith Apple Bread (great, period).<br />While the Clayton bread books are more comprehensive, I find that this reference is both more reable and easier to understand.<br />Whether you are new to bread or an old hand at it, this book will have something to offer you!	2000-11-30

It's fun to read and VERY comprehensive.  This is excellent instruction for the beginning cook, but has plenty of information for more experienced buyers also.  So many of today's cookbooks are more specialized than the average cook wants.  Or, they will use ingredients unavailable in regular markets.  This book will demonstrate how to make delicious dishes using readily-available ingredients, able to be created by the less-experienced cook.<br />Along with Cunningham's Fannie Farmer books, this should be a keystone to a cook's collection.	2000-11-30

No weird names; no combining ingredients that weren't meant to be together.  The opposite of chi-chi.  Just good, comfortable food that'll sit well on  your stomach and you'll get a decent portion besides!  Restaurants like  Mama Dip's are always popular wherever they are.  You'd think the big  corporations would learn that...	2000-07-16

This woman's love for her family, for others, and for God shines through every page.  That this love is combined with an iron determination and discipline makes a very remarkable person.  After reading her book, I'd love to drive to Harlem and meet her!  As a  white Southerner I am grateful to her for her documentation of our recipes.  These were common to both black and white Southern people who farmed and  wasted NOTHING.  Thank you, Sylvia, and the best of continued success to  you and your family!	2000-07-16

I have one criterion that overrides all others when I get a new cookbook:  does it make me want to get up and cook?  This one did, in spades.  I could hardly wait until the next morning to go shopping!  Beautifully and clearly  written, it will become a permanent part of my books.	2000-07-16

For most, if their work in life was to have any dignity, they had to provide it as a living example.  I also grew up with one of these women.  It was a  symbiotic relationship between them and our families.  The authors have  done a great job documenting this work; I enjoyed Annie's parts and wished  she had said more!  Of course, the traditional recipes of our South are  always a pleasure to read, and to cook.  A beautiful book, beautifully  bound, perfect for a gift.	2000-07-16

I bought my first copy many years ago and was captivated.  This cookbook is a perfect blend of memories and recipies--one doesn't  overpower the other.  I've cooked most of the recipes in the book, and  their cornbread recipe has become my standard for home and 'pot luck'.  I've bought many copies of this book for gifts.  Mine have been worn out  from loaning to friends.  A great achievement on the part of the writers.  A book to keep.	2000-06-15

Not only is the quality of the writing superior, but the photos are beautiful also.  The book is  written in the straightforward and informative style one would expect from  Mr. Lamb.

The quality of the comments is lacking and the photo quality quite inferior.  Maybe this book is well  suited for someone not truly interested in Presidential history, but then,  would they make the effort to visit these places anyway?  A big  disappointment.	2000-03-27
US	51862495	R2NC2G67P6PLO0	0826211712	184411130	The Dying President: Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1944-1945	Books	1	10	22	N	Y	Sloppy and Depressing	I couldn't help but contrast this book with the Bishop book, 'FDR's Last Year'.  This writer paints FDR as someone and something far different than I've read in many, many other books.  He most certainly was ill, he had  poor medical care, and possibly he deceived the nation about his true  condition.  However, he also provided the nation with reassuring leadership  and contributed to our war effort literally until his death.  This book is  poorly organized, but worse, is mean-spirited.  Definitely a 'pass'.	2000-03-27
