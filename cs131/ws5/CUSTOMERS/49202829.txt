While Munroe give amazing depth to the stories I found that there was very little movement in the stories and they seemed merely to describe various  incidents in the lives of some interesting people.

The opening chapter describes the brutal rape of the author at the end of her freshman year at University. The subsequent chapters deal with feelings of guilt and anger and her struggle to relate to those closest to her, her mother father and sister and good friends. She also has difficulties with the police who are depicted as something less than sympathetic. On her return to University her spots the rapist on the street and turns him into the police where he is subsequently charged and convicted through the courageous tenacity of Alice.<BR> The power in the telling of this true story lies in the uncompromising steely eyed look and description of the emotions surrounding Alice's rape. How does the victim react to those who love her but are incapable or at least unable to express support in a meaningful way? How do the prejudices and biases harboured by police, friends, family and psychiatrists fail to give the needed support? And not only that, they blame the victim. <BR> Then when a close friend of Alice is raped and Alice is not able to comfort or support her does it become clear that there is little anyone can offer the victim except warm and caring love, and even that is not enough and as Alice says at the end of the fourth chapter \\"No one can pull anyone back from anywhere. You save yourself or you remain unsaved.\\"<br />In the final chapter \\"Aftermath\\" Alice describes her life during the next ten years and we see that the rape is not an incident in the past that one \\"gets over\\" but a defining moment that affects Alice and all rape victims in way that is permanent and like survivors of the Vietnam war is identified as Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. <br />As a man I wondered how would I respond to a rape victim. Is loving care the best we can do? It becomes evident that the only positive way is to work to prevent rapes. This is a book worth reading as difficult as that is. Alice Seabold has done a great service in telling her story. 4.5/5	2003-01-07

The characterization of the three main characters, Michael Dillon, Moira and Andrea  is brilliant. Each in a way a complex stereotypical actor caught in the lime light of the \\"troubles\\" in Northern Ireland. Michael, born and raised in Belfast is sensitive and bright and wants to fulfil his potential as a poet but is caught in the humdrum need to make a living because he married a woman, Moira, who's beauty he admired and longed for but who's mind he had never examined. Moira, was also raised in Belfast, and unlike Michael, longs to return to her birthplace. Bright, but vain and bulimic She is terrified of ageing but finds new strength and purpose when she decides to oppose the IRA. Andrea, a Canadian in England to study, cannot fathom the problems of Northern Ireland and only longs for peace and security with Michael Dillon. <br />The plot involves the attempted assassination of Northern Ireland's Protestant leader, Pottinger, by having Michael, the manager of a Hotel where Pottinger is giving a speech, drive a car bomb to just outside the hotel room where Pottinger is speaking. Meanwhile the IRA thugs hold Michael's wife hostage with the threat of killing her if he does not follow through. Michael at the last possible minute decides to alert the authorities because 100's might die if the bomb goes off. The fall out for everyone, Michael's wife Moira and his girl friend Andrea and the IRA are taut and filled with suspense.<br />Very good, well written thriller.	2002-12-31

He finds nothing exclusive about these religions and that each one worships the one true God.<br />The story is not the story but a medium for Martel to reflect on life's vagaries and illuminate a deep religious conviction that cuts through the meaninglessness of most lives.

If the British argot doesn't get to you, the slow development of the story will. The protagonist doesn't really begin to take hold of the story until a hundred pages into the book. Justine, the constant gardener, is a complex character as is his wife, the murdered Tessa. The problem that she is trying to stop is the testing of a new drug for TB by a multinational that is killing some of the test subjects. The collusion of the local government and even British Intelligence, bought off by the drug company, sounds only too plausible and is a well-told story. The ending is a bit weak and somewhat philosophical rather than definitive.	2002-12-24

So begins the case for Harry Bosch which will lead him to the identity of the child and the story of a brutal and too short life told by his bones. The cast of characters includes his sister, father, mother and good friend who reveal different parts of his troubled life. Along the way Harry encounters a rookie cop who ignites a long dead passion. The story plunges along at breakneck speed and turns from a routine investigation to one filled with tragedy as a loose lipped cop and the press misidentify the killer.<br />A very good read typical of all Connelly books. Harry Bosch again comes through as a tough, sympathetic but somewhat flawed protagonist.

They story begins to make sense and wind down when it leads to someone who was a partner of the serial killer and likely one of two present day neighborhood men and an incident that happened when Patrick was a child.<br />The book is well written, exciting and a real page-turner.

In a Dry Season by Peter Robinson Viking 1999<br />I have been a fan of Peter Robinson and his protagonist Alan Banks from the beginning and this book is one of the best I have read so far. When a dry season empties a reservoir and exposes the remains of a 50 year-old village, a young boy discovers a  skeleton, an apparent a murder victim from the wartime. Banks and local detective Sargent, Annie Cabbot, begin to untangle the relationships of old and in a beautiful recreation of that time of blackout lights and Glenn Miller in the diary of a contemporary of the murder victim, the secret lives and lusts of the old village and its inhabitants. The two stories, the diary and the present investigation, flow contiguously and powerfully, drawing the reader along at a furious pace. The clues a subtle and the ending somewhat of a surprise.<br />Bank's marriage has fallen apart and as he struggles with the changes in his life and those of his children, Robinson presents a very credible sub plot. The falling into bed with Annie and the resulting shift in their perceptions of each other is brilliantly written and quite believable. The last book I read nearly this good was also by Peter Robinson. Highly recommended to all mystery fans.	2001-03-24

Emmet and his daughter Barbara have an incestuous relationship of long standing which has been kept secret from Constance. Barbara is also having affair with a young Noah,  being sponsored at Harvard Law School by their neighbor, retired Judge Hampton, who is sleeping with Noah's mother.

To do this he masquerades as a stable boy and shifts from horse yard to horse yard until he discovers who is doing it and finally how it is being done. In doing so, Daniel places himself and Elinor, the young daughter of the Earl of October, at considerable risk. In a final confrontation with the bad guys Daniel overcomes his adversaries but is thrown in jail accused of murder to await the return of the Earl of October. <br />Like most of Francis' protagonists, Daniel is youngish, handsome, honest beyond measure and quite capable at a number of things useful to someone working with horses. A sub plot to the main story is the wrongful accusation of Daniel by the older Earl's daughter of sexual abuse and his growing involvement with the younger. <br />To the seasoned Francis reader, this book does not have too much depth but like all Francis mysteries, a joy to read.	2001-03-07

Only when Terry discovers that Graciela's sister is Gloria Torres, the donor of his new heart, does he find himself inexorably drawn in to the search for Gloria's murderer. The investigation is at a standstill until Terry ties Gloria's murder to another local murder and through meticulous searching to a third murder committed with the same gun. Puzzled by the coincidences in these three cases McCaleb again goes over the police reports and videos again and again until he stumbles on the thread that ties all three murders together and also staggeringly, to him. <br />Meanwhile Terry  finds himself drawn to Graciela and her dead sister's son, 6 year-old Raymond and feels himself opening up to feelings that he have been dormant for many years.  When Graciela and Raymond are kidnaped and held hostage Terry's search leads him to abandon all reasonable care for himself and his new heart and finally track down this cold blooded murder.<br />This is and amazingly well written book chock full of information on heart transplant care and the psychological abyss facing the transplant recipient. Terry McCaleb is a very sympathetic protagonist and the characters of Graciela and Jaye Winston, his policewoman accomplice are well drawn with a good sense of reality. This is the first mystery I have read in quite a while that leaves me with a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment. I recommend it to all mystery fans.	2001-03-07

Death Benefits by Thomas Perry  Random House 2001<br />While I am more familiar with Perry's Jane Whitfield series, which by the way are excellent, this mystery is rich in excitement, detail and well-developed characters.<br />A scam has been perpetuated against the McClaren Insurance company and Max Stillman, an insurance investigator, picks John Walker to help him because John had been very close to Ellen Snyder, a woman who has also disappeared. In their search for Ellen and some leads about the missing 10 million they encounter several bad guys and get roughed up and a computer specialist who can seemingly get into any data base. When a hurricane hits Florida, John is not only caught in the midst of it but uncovers a thread of the scam they are investigating. Several clever deductions lead John Max and Mary Catherine Casey ( John's new girl friend) to a small New Hampshire town that proves to be the base of a much larger scam than they started with.<br />The last 100 pages of the mystery are a real screamer and will keep you reading late into the night as John, Max and Mary struggle to save their lives and return with the story.<br />Once again Thomas Perry has not disappointed me. The only tiny point of criticism is that John's relationship with Max seems much too unlikely. He follows Max with too obligingly. Never-the-less and excellent read.	2001-02-16

Putnam's Sons NY 2000<br />Dr. Kay Scarpetta is at the end of her tether. At the end of the previous book she had barely survived the murderous attack of &quot;la loup garrou&quot; (werewolf), Jean Batiste Chandonne, and now she has to move out of her house and stay with her good friend, psychiatrist Dr. Anna Zenner. Under Anna's care, Kay begins to come to grips with the death of her former lover, Benton Wesley, the previous year, and the tumult of her life as Chief Medical Examiner. She then is brought before a Grand Jury on suspicion of murder of the former Chief of Police (one of the werewolf's victims). <br />Jay Talley , Kay's friend and lover from Paris, working on the werewolf cases in France, shows up on her doorstep when it is found that a New York murder two years previously was also a victim of the werewolf. The story gets even more complicated when two other murders and the strangling of a young boy cloud the investigative waters. Kay eventually comes out the other side of this tangled mess but not before she discovers who the real instigator of Benton's death was and finds out who her real friends are. <br />This book starts immediately after the end of the last book &quot;Black Notice&quot; ends and needs to be read before starting this one. This is not one of Cornwell's better books. It serves to tie up a number of loose ends in Kay's life but the story line is weak and cluttered with too many dead bodies whose presence only minimally contributes to the story. I am glad that Cornwell got this out of her system and hope that Kay Scarpetta can find a new and exciting life as she is recreated.	2001-02-13

The book is truly horrifying and I don't think I understand any better who these brutal murders really are. If I had been able to read the whole book maybe I would have but after struggling through the killing of Karla's sister and the beginning of the story of the next victim, I was not able to continue.<br />The part I read was well written and certainly graphic. I would not recommend this book to the weak stomached.	2001-02-01

A call in the middle of the night wakens Joanne Kilbourn to ask that her 83 year-old friend and house guest, Hilda McCourt, identify the body. It turns out that Hilda has been asked by the Judge to decide if she  is becoming senile. Judge McCourt has been spending a lot of time developing a halfway house for released criminals and her three daughters think she is losing it. When a will shows up that leaves the bulk of her fortune to the halfway house, the daughters become very upset. Some very unsavory characters at the halfway are linked to the Judge and come under suspicion. When Hilda is attacked and nearly killed in Joanne's home Joanne begins to put the pieces together and eventually solve the riddle of the Judges death.<br />The personal life of Joanne continues to be hectic. Her budding romance with Alex Kequahtooway, hits some snags when Alex's nephew Eli, disappears and Joanne's good-intentioned comments about his care raise Alex's hackles. An old lover returns to Saskatoon and wants to rekindle their old flame and throws Joanne into a bit of a tizzy.  Joanne becomes a grandmother and her adopted daughter continues to grow in spirit and painting ability. <br />A good solid read but not as good as &quot;Burying Ariel&quot;. After watching two made-for-TV movies of Bowen's previous books just before reading this book I had a little trouble getting my head around Joanne's character again. They are presented quite differently in book and movie.	2001-02-01

The suspects range from a school teacher, Owen Pierce, who is slowly recovering from a failed 5 year affair with one of his former students, a young hoodlum, John Spinks, a Croatian immigrant drunk who has accused the local Pastor of sexual advances, and the local Pastor. The circumstantial evidence against Owen is very strong and when he is charged, tried and acquitted of the murder, many are very upset. Banks returns to the case and when another murder similar to the first is committed Owen is again the chief suspect and again the evidence against him is very strong. When it is discovered that Owen has a perfect alibi and was the victim of a frame, other suspects come into view. Clever work by Banks reveals all and the murder is brought to heel and several other community problems are resolved.<br />One always feels a little superior when the murderer is identified before the end of the book but in this case the murderer seems a little obvious even if the motive is a little obscure. This is the first Inspector Banks book that I have read in several years and was impressed that the quality of the writing had not changed with time. A good read that I would recommend to all mystery fans.	2001-02-01

The trail eventually leads to a Veterans Hospital where they suspect the Mastermind lives and in a few short suspenseful pages brings the suspected Mastermind to heel.<br />The story flows smoothly, punctuated with brief glimpses of Alex's failing romance with his new son's mother, Christine and his beginning relationship with Betsey. Alex's struggle to keep his commitments to his family and to his job are exacerbated by the sudden collapse and hospitalization of his daughter Jannie with a brain tumor. The compassionate and likable Alex is faced with some big choices.<br />A good read which I enjoyed immensely.	2001-01-26

The main characters are superbly drawn while Thomas remains for us only a wispy image generated by his thoughts. <br />The love of Henry for Katerina is constant, undemanding and rises above the everyday demands of mere mortals. Katerina, on the other hand moves by her own light and one is never sure if she is capable of loving and one wonders too what has caused this strange disconnectedness.<br />There are wryly funny sections and clear bright narrative bits that draw the reader in. At the end one realizes that the story is touchingly sentimental while being questioningly honest. I liked the book but had a strange unsatisfied feeling when I was finished. I wanted to know more of Henry, Katerina and Thomas.	2001-01-17

While the main character in each book seems to be the same person with a different name and often a different job, the stories have been exciting and beautifully written. In this mystery Gerard Logan, young, fit and handsome, is a glass blower of renown who befriends a jockey, Martin Stuckely. Martin has been given a video tape which is said to contain information worth millions for safe keeping and before he can pass it on to Gerard dies in a race accident. When the tape is passed on to Gerard, it is stolen before he has a chance to view it. <br />The plot revolves around Gerard trying to find out what the tape contains and to try and stay clear of those who are trying to recover it. As usual the protagonist is severely beaten but refuses to knuckle under to the criminals. In the end Gerard solves the puzzle and recovers the tape.<br />This book is well written but the story is a bit contrived. Dick Francis has given us a close look inside the art of glass blowing and describes the process beautifully. The cast of characters is numerous but thinly fleshed out and not up to the usual standards set by Dick Francis. While I enjoyed the read, I was, on the whole, disappointed.	2001-01-12

Rosie and Rooney, her two best friends, are on their honeymoon in Europe and Lorraine is busy setting up her new apartment and office called &quot;Page Investigations&quot;. A telephone call, ostensibly from Cindy Nathan, takes her to the house of Harry Nathan, a very wealthy film producer and owner of Maximedia, who has just been murdered. Cindy, Harry's wife, is  a suspect and Page Investigations is hired by Cindy to find the murderer of Harry.<br />Harry's two former wives (Kendall and Sonja) and a long time friend, Raymond Vallance are also part of the coterie that are suspected of Harry's murder. As Lorraine digs into Harry's past she uncovers an art fraud scheme that has netted about 20 million dollars but no one seems to know when the money or paintings are. When Cindy is found dead, an apparent suicide, Lorraine suspects Kendall but Raymond Vallance also comes under scrutiny. Harry's penchant for videotaping his sex games with wives and friends could also be a motive for murder and the case becomes even more complicated when the brother of the boy Lorraine shot while she was with the police, enters and arranges a fatal accident for Lorraine's new secretary. Also on the scene is a new chief of detectives, Jake Burton,. who Lorraine falls for like a ton of bricks and severely complicates her life. <br />Lorraine wades through the clues and finally solves the puzzle. but before she can do anything about it she is severely beaten by the brother of her shooting victim.<br />Lynda La Plante as always tells a good story, full of excitement. Lorraine Page has been the protagonist in other La Plant mysteries and is a very sympathetic character. In the others she struggles with her alcoholism; in this one she is finally getting it together. The story tends to drag alittle and is not quite up to the level her other books. Never-the-less a good read.	2001-01-08

The twins' characters are fully developed as are the other minor characters, Luis Grimaldi, Ruda's husband; Torsen Heinz, the Stazi police officer investigating the murder of Ruda's husband, Tommy Kellerman.<br />All in all a very satisfying read that I would recommend to all mystery and thriller fans.	2001-01-04

This one was not up to the high standards set by the others.<br />In this Karl Alberg mystery, a murdered woman had left husband and 13 year old daughter seven years previously with only a smidgen of a note that told hardly anything of why she left. Karl will not rest until he has solved the puzzle relating to her death and disappearance. The story is a bit contrived and moves at a very slow pace. <br />The long standing romance of Karl and Cassandra Mitchel has picked up finally and they have decided to get married and have begun house hunting. As always, L.R.Wright's description of Sechelt is vivid and evocative and adds immeasurably to the story.	2000-12-24

He remains as Irish as the day he came and tells his story with wit and verve.<br />In Angela's Ashes the poignancy of poverty and a run-away father told in a child's voice brought me to tears as did his constant struggle to live up to a church whose stern voice incessantly called for repentance. &quot;`Tis&quot; is a different sort of book and while charming did not have the same emotional pull as&quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;.<br />A good read and I would recommend it.	2000-12-11

The founder and president of ITC is the brilliant physicist Robert Doniger whose secrecy is legendary and whose research into high speed computers and medical technology are only a cover for his time travel experiments. The team leader, Dr Edward Johnston returns to the US to try and discover what is going on and ends up lost in the past at the time when their excavation site is in the midst of the 100 year war.<br />Chris, Kate and Andre, part of the archaeological team, go back in time to try and find Dr Johnston and bring him back. From this point on it is touch and go if they will be able to return. They find themselves embroiled in the war and are trusted by neither side. Time and time again they are captured, only to escape by the skin of their teeth only to be caught up again in the treacherous and murderous schemes of the combating knights.<br />The story is fast paced, filled with exciting skirmishes and hundreds of minute details of a life and times of 600 years previous. I enjoyed the detail and the excitement and had difficulty putting the book down. It is one of Crichton's better books.	2000-12-11

North Point Press San Fransisco 1985<br />On the surface this is a love story. Phillip Dean, an American dropout from Yale, and Anne-Mari Costallat, a French shop girl, live and love, love, love... for several months in France. As the observer/narrator tells the story, one is never quite certain whether the narrative is an objective account of the life of Phillip and Anne-Mari or a fabricated wish fulfillment of a frustrated stymied paramour of the beautiful Claude Picquet. In the end it doesn't matter as the story ebbs and flows inexorably and smoothly through the shimmering French countryside to its tragic conclusion.<br />The writing is astounding. I stopped time and again to read and reread passages as the combinations of words and phrases evoked emotions and feelings that I thought not possible given the simplicity and directness of the words. There is a conciseness to both the story and the language. So much is said with so few words that one sometimes regrets that this parsimony of words brings the end too soon. I wanted the novel to continue so I might continue to savor this beautiful writing.<br />A wonderful novel that I will continue to read for years to come.	2000-11-07

The story line is simple. An elderly physician, Ben Givens, discovers he has colon cancer and decides that he does not want to wait for a painful slow ending but would rather commit suicide. His wife died several years previously and he does not want to subject his daughter and grandchildren to the sight of his slow death. <br />He plans meticulously so that it will appear to be a hunting accident. The story unfolds as he travels with his hunting dogs to where he is going to hunt. Several things happen on his journey that lead him to reconsider his decision. <br />The characterization of Ben is very believable and most of the characters appearing along the way are very sympathetic and likeable. (I think Guterson has difficulty drawing a truly despicable character). The descriptions of this part of Washington State are incredibly beautiful and evocative of a youth full of passion for this part of the country. Another echo from Snow Falling on Cedars is the depiction of the brutality and senselessness of war and its life changing effects.<br />I did not find this book as fulfilling as &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; and the plot seems a bit contrived. However the visual word pictures painted by Guterson are remarkable and worth the read alone.	2000-10-27

The Body Farm by Patricia Cornwell     Beverly Books, New York 1995<br />Kay Scarpetta, lawyer/forensic pathologist, investigates the brutal killing and sexual molestation of a young girl. Several characteristics of the death remind Kay and the ever-present Pete Marino of a recent case where the clever and vicious pathological killer Temple Gault murdered a young boy. Gault was never caught and remains an illusive and tantalizing suspect in the case.<br />Kay's niece, the brilliant and rebellious Lucy, gets herself into a bunch of trouble at the FBI Quantico computer research facility that threatens to ruin her future and nearly cost her her life. Benton Wesley, an FBI profiler, works closely with Kay and Marino to find the killer of the young girl. As the relationship between Kay and Wesley heats up, Marino becomes obnoxious and difficult to get along with. His own frustration, jealousy and loneliness draw him into a very unsatisfactory relationship that come close to ending his career.<br />This is one of Cornwell's better books. The plotting is tight and characters well developed. The continued growth in the relationship between Kay and Wesley is interesting and has an aura of reality. One unsatisfactory note is the failure to tie up a couple of loose ends at the end of the story, but that's a minor detail. A very good read!	2000-10-26

The finding of a dead young girl in a garbage can next to Joanne's daughter's store is followed shortly by the apparent suicide her son's girlfriend (Christy). The two victims had known each other and the police are wondering what they could have known that would lead to their deaths.

The kidnaping of her five-year-old-adopted daughter, sends her rushing to rescue her daughter and in the end to solve the murders of young women and bring some very despicable people to justice.<br />The principal characters are well drawn and the family life of the widowed Joanne is very realistic. Joanne and her children are thoroughly modern in their relationships and it will be interesting to see if these relationships continue through the other books in the series. <br />By and large a good read.	2000-10-20

Everest Disaster	Books	5	0	0	N	N	exceptional	Into Thin Air Jon Krakauer  1997<br />This book details the experiences of Jon Krakauer when he joined a commercial expedition to climb Mount Everest. This exciting story follows a group of eight people who have paid up to $70,000 each for the climb. Jon, an adventure writer who is being sponsored by his employers, is an experienced mountain climber. The climb ends in disaster, when, through some very small mistakes by several people and a blizzard, trap some climbers near the summit. Krakauer feels terribly guilty about his failures and is brutally honest about the whole experience. The writing of the book helped him to begin to put some perspective on the whole incident but from his own words, he was a changed man by the experience. <br />The commercialization of the Everest climb had resulted in too many people being on the route to the summit at the same time and it was extremely interesting to see how egos and money led the competing organizations to run very close to the edge and take excessive risks. The number of people reaching the summit in each group was the criterion by which they would be able to sell the next seasons climbing expedition.<br />I enjoyed the book and found that it was extremely exciting, particularly the last few chapters during the actual storm. That men and women would suffer such extreme pain in order to reach the summit is incredible. <br />I highly recommend this book.	2000-10-20

In this book, Kate is put on the trail of a missing lyricist and bed partner of a rising rock star. The missing Moira has been through a really tough time venturing into heroin addiction and prostitution and has finally ended up with her lesbian Social Worker. When Kate finds her, she agrees to come back and join the rock star in writing songs but not in bed. However, she is soon found dead with a full caste of likely suspects. Kate very cleverly finds the murderer amidst the hangers-on in the rock star's mansion and flushes him out in a clever maneuver. <br />This book is perhaps not quite as graphic in its descriptions of crime scenes as the other two books, but Kate is a very exciting, thoroughly modern young woman with a quick wit and Thai boxing experience. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.	2000-10-10

This beautifully written story follows Daisy Goodwill throughout her life, her birth, her marriages, her death. It is a simple story but filled with wonderful characters who lead complex but mostly unfulfilled  lives. Daisy's mother dies within minutes of her birth and while this fact is never faced directly by Daisy, it seems to be an essential aspect of her longing for fulfillment. Each member of the four generations of Daisy's family is treated with compassion and sensitivity. Even her spiteful and miserly father-in-law, Magnus Flett, manages to redeem himself by living to be115 years old and memorizing the whole of Jayne Ayre. <br />Men do not come of well in this story but then neither do the women. A major theme throughout the story is the conflict between interior life and exterior life. The often rich interior life is never quite matched by reality and prevents any real happiness from bursting through the plodding heavy duty of their lives. In the end, sorting through Daisy's possessions we see the inconsequential nature of most of what we bring with us. <br /> The book is filled with beautiful language and striking images. I enjoyed the book immensely.	2000-10-10

This book has everything!<br />Saving Faith by David Baldacci, Warner Books  1999<br />An exceptional thriller that takes the reader compellingly to a  fever pitch of excitement that keeps the pages turning then takes a few  twists of plot at the end to keep it really interesting and surprising.<br />A  high level renegade CIA leader, Bob Thornhill, has under his control a  former lobbyist for big business, Daniel Bucanan. Thornhill has discovered  that Bucanan has used his considerable talents and financial resources to  win large sums for the poor of the world by bribing US legislators to pass  legislation favoring poor countries. By threatening to expose Bucanan's  plan Thornhill has obtained the evidence of bribery and is going to use it  for his own nefarious ends. When Faith Lockhart, Bucanan's beautiful and  resourceful assistant decides to go to the FBI to try and cop a plea for  her and her surrogate father, Bucanan, Thornhill decides their usefulness  is finished and orders them killed.

The serial killer,  named Queer Killer by the local police, and Handy Andy by profiler Tony  Hill is very bright and covers his tracks well while torturing his victims  in some ingenious and time honored methods. <br />The two principal  characters, Dr. Tony Hill and Carol Jordan are very interesting and complex  personalities. As their relationship develops, their fragility and  weaknesses hinder a commitment. Tony in particular is struggling with his  own sexuality and as he delves into the twisted mind of Handy Andy. <br />This  is a well written mystery with a well developed cast of characters whose  interactions provide  interesting subplots. The main plot is complex, has  several unusual turns and a very surprising ending. There is plenty of  excitement as Handy Andy skillfully dispatches his victims and then reaches  into the task force for the next victim to demonstrate his superior  abilities and to put the police in their place.<br />An excellent read!	2000-08-19

The book is filled with believable characters with interesting lives  outside of their work and relationships that makes the skin tingle with  tension. <br />The plot is skillfully crafted and moves quickly from the  kidnaping of young children to the internecine competition between the FBI  and the Seattle Police Department. Someone within the two groups is giving  the kidnapers inside information and when Lou Boldt's child is kidnaped and  he is told to slow down the investigation or he won't see his child again,  the tension rises to unimaginable heights. For those who are parents and  perhaps even those who arnt, the thought of  losing a child to kidnapers  brings a dimension and intensity to the plot that is at times  unbearable.<br />This is a well written and carefully crafted book filled with  excitement and enough twists and turns of plot to hold anyone. I can't wait  for the next one.	2000-08-19

The widow of a  small town policeman asks Kinsey Millhone to find the reason for her  husbands fretfulness and ill-ease just before he dies of a heart attack.  While this appears at first to be a fruitless exercise, Kinsey obviously  disturbs someone during her rooting around into his life and begins to  wonder who is upset enough to harm her. Two related murders separated by 5  years throw suspicion on the staff of the local police department and  others in the small town in the Sierra mountains. Kinsey's search puts her  in harms way and only through skilful questioning and deduction does she  arrive at the answers she seeks and escapes a final deadly encounter with  the guilty party.<br />The story moves fairly quickly but there is a lack of  tension and excitement until the final chapter where Kinsey once again  survives to rule the day.<br />On the whole this book is not up to the  standards I have come to expect from Sue Grafton but I still look forward  to her next mystery &quot;O is for Outlaw&quot;.	2000-07-20

Black Notice by Patricia Cromwell 1999<br />I have read and enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta series by Patricia Cornwell for several years and have been impressed with the high quality of the writing and the exciting stories she  tells. This book is no exception and as the story flowed I found myself  involved from beginning to end and had difficulty putting the book down.     From the recovery of an unknown body in a container ships cargo to the  streets of Paris the story moves swiftly and when it appears that a  murderous psychotic has travelled to Kay's home town the intensity picks up  and in the final chapters it is impossible to stop reading. The beautiful  and vicious new police chief whose main purpose in life seems to be to get  Kay fired provides the hurdles that Kay must jump in order to keep her job  and bring the murderer to heel. <br />Kay's niece, Lucy, whose career and love  life form a significant subplot keep us engrossed in her development and we  wonder if  she will survive in the male dominated machismo climate in the  ATF.<br />The book opens with a letter from Kay's dead former lover Benton  Wesley. Kay's struggle to deal with it forms a thread running through the  story providing a sense of reality often missing in other mystery writer's  works. And the burning question of all true Kay Scarpetta fans &quot;Will  Kay find a replacement for Benton Wesley?&quot; may be answered.	2000-07-19

First  published in Great Britain by Harper-Collins Publishers 1991 under the  authors pseudonym  Patrick Buell <br />Inspector Dog Cicero begins to  investigate a missing child, whose disappearance looks suspiciously like a  case of child abuse or even murder. The flaming red hair of the child's  beautiful mother, Mrs. Jane Maguire, and her Irish lilt bring back painful  memories of a time 10 years previously in Ireland with Special Services.  His face was half blown off and the woman he loved was killed in a car bomb  explosion set by the IRA. Jane reminds Dog of his lost lover and he cannot  decide if his unwillingness to believe Jane guilty of the murder of her  child is because of her resemblance to his former lover or to the paucity  of facts supporting her guilt.<br />In his investigation Dog keeps stumbling  over Superintendent Toby Tench of Special Branch and  begins to wonder if  there is more to Jane than meets the eye. The meanness and jealousy of   Toby Tench, a schoolmate and bully from Dog's younger days have not  improved and Dog must be not only circumspect but guarded to keep his  disfigured body in one piece.<br />As the complex and riveting story plunges  ahead with swiftness and clarity, Dog discovers not only what happened in  Ireland 10 years previously but the story behind the mysterious Jane and  her dead husband. Consummate gambler Uncle Endo, Dog's spiritual guide and  teacher, has an aphorism (or are they really Dog's?) for every occasion and  as the story races to it's surprising conclusion Dog places his life and  happiness on the line. <br />This wonderfully written book has enough twists  and turns to keep everyone guessing until the very end and enough gut  wrenching scenes to keep the pages turning. I thoroughly enjoyed the book  and recommend it to all mystery fans.	2000-07-08
