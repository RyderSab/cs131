Although this is a good story which even stands the test of time, I'm really dissappointed in Lisa Jackson and her advisors.  I've often said that reissued books should be clearly stamped on the cover, and they should certainly at least retain the same title rather than change the title in an effort to fool even the most saavy reader. I read this book many years ago under a different title, 'Treasures'. How was I to know that I was purchasing a book that I'd already read when there was no indication on the front cover and, in fact, a completely new  title? Jackson does inform readers on the back cover but as a fan I immediately purchase any new title by Jackson without reading the summary. That said, I was unable to give this book a poor rating because new readers will actually enjoy the long-lost heiress (with a twist) story of Adria Nash and Zach Danvers.	2004-08-02

If I had known it was a reissue, I would not have purchased it.  It bothers me that publishers reissue books by popular authors without clearly noting this! &quot;The Shadow Of Time&quot; is a fairly common story about a lover thought to be dead who mysteriously returns several years later.  Shane Kennedy is embittered by his near death experience in Ireland and by Mara's failure to wait for his return.  Mara did not know that Shane had survived and had therefore married in order to provide a home for her child.  Shane is cruel and Mara is far too unliberated for my taste. She may remember a time when Shane was worth loving but the reader never sees that side of him. There are far better books out there to read, many by this author, for anyone to want to read this outdated reissue.	2004-07-18

Reading an Eve Diamond novel is like going on a ride at Disney. You truly believe you are experiencing every twist and turn in the plot until the ride ends and you realize how much you enjoyed the delusion.  Hamilton's Los Angeles is as grity and tough as it is intimate and vulnerable and her protagonist reflects the City in which she grew up. In this episode Eve is trying to rescue an infant who is a pawn in some unknown scheme involving Asian drug trafficking, the INS, and a reknowned human rights attorney. Eve doggedly pursues this story while also grappeling with her feelings for her current lover and a past lover who has mysteriously reappeared in her life.  We can\\"t help but root for this gutsy heroine as she follows confusing leads to a deadly conclusion.  I would give more than five stars to this entire series if I could.  Read them all!!	2004-04-06

Townsend, a Miami prosecutor faces her worst nightmare when the man who brutally raped and left her for dead twelve years ago appears in the courtroom as her prime suspect. William Bantling, the man who she is prosecuting is accused of the serial slayings of ten beautiful young women. After realizing that the statute of limitations has run out on her own rape she knows that her only peace of mind might lie in prosecuting a case from which she should rightfully excuse herself. Unable to move on with her life without punishing Bantling for his crimes she must decide whether she can live with bending the law to reach a just end.  The case and evidence become more and more confused as CJ tries to keep from falling apart before the trial is completed. CJ and Dominick Falconetti, the lead investigator on the case embark on a tenous relationship as they each try to piece together the evidence and to come to terms with their past and with the ethical questions that face them.<br />This story is incredibly well written with characters that are compelling and enough surprises to keep the most inciteful reader guessing. The investigation and the courtroom scenes are sprinkled with enough realism to to entice the reader while not bogging the prose with unnecessary detail. It is always exciting to find a great new book, but particularly so when the author is new as well.  I can't wait to read Hoffman's next book.<br />(For anyone who has seen the few poor ratings you might want to note that these reviewers are unwilling to put their names to the unjust reviews they have written.)	2004-03-12

It manages to address these issues without detracting from its very entertaining and engrossing saga of an American Presidency which began in &quot;No Safe Place&quot; and &quot;Protect And Defend&quot;.  This story revisits President Kerry Kilcannon and his lover, Journalist Lara Costello.  Kilcannon has successfully weathered the first trial of his presidency with the Senate approval of his selection of supreme court chief justice Caroline Masters. He has also convinced his long time lover Lara Costello to become his wife.  He looks forward to his upcoming wedding to Lara, but she is afraid that the hoopla surrounding the wedding gala will be harmful to her family, particularly to her sister Joan who is finally seeking help from the President in order to protect herself and her young daughter from her disturbed and abusive husband.  The massacre of Lara's family that follows their highly publicized wedding convinces Kerry to doggedly pursue gun control legislation and to try to eradicate the powerful gun lobby.  However, the cost to his presidency and his marriage may be far greater than Kilcannon believed possible.<br />Though it is abundantly evident that Patterson sides with his protagonist, the topic of gun control is expertly debated as Kilcannon and his associates explore both sides of this intriguing and disturbing issue. It is the legal battles and legislative battles that add realism and excitement to this story of family loss and redemption.  The more I read of Patterson's works the more addicted I become to his characters and tales.	2003-12-15

'The Breathtaker' by Alice Blanchard is so well written that I'm not sure whether I enjoyed the plot, the charachters or the descriptions of the town and the storms most.  Together they create one of the most original mysteries I've read in many years.<br />Charlie Grover, recently widowed police chief in a small midwest town, is the victim of a childhood fire that left him scarred both physically and psychologically. He is doing his best to help his feisty teenage daughter after the recent death of his wife from cancer but his long hours at work are taking their toll on their relationship. When a devastating tornado sweeps through the town Charlie discovers that three murders have been committed under cover of the tornado. Additional research convinces Charlie that there are previous murders that have been committed by this dangerously derranged killer. He seeks the help of Willa Bellman, a tornado researcher and part of a group of local storm chasers, to whom he has had an attraction in the past. Together they must find the culprit before the next tornado hits and he finds his next victims.<br />This story succeds on many levels.  It is informative, beautifully written, exciting and suspenseful. Along with 'Darkness Peering' it puts Blanchard at the top of my list of favorite mystery writers.	2003-12-14

As soon as I finished 'Blackwater Sound' I found myself searching for the next book by James W. Hall that I would read.  Hall's charachters are vividly drawn and though flawed, very likeable.  I was happy to discover that Hall's newest novel revisits Thorn, Alexandra, Lawton and Sugarman as I've grown to love them.<br />In 'Blackwater Sound' Thorn is accidentally visited by an injured old man, Lawton Collins, who is suffering from not only a knife wound but the early stages of Alzheimer's. He likes Lawton and tries to help him by giving him a place to stay and some rudimentary first aid. Lawton wanders off and his daughter, Alexandra, in an effort to find her father encounters Thorn. She is understandably upset with Thorn's irresponsible care of her dad and each goes off separately to search for Lawton and to investigate his connection to the murder of a shady friend, a missing electronic device and a recent airplane crash. Inevitably they find they must work together to solve this intriguing mystery.<br />The plot is original, the writing crisp and the charachters are unforgettable. You'll really enjoy this one!	2003-12-14

This book started slowly but the finish more than made up for the slow start. Howard tackles the very difficult subject of illegal adoption rings and of kidnapped infants and the consequences for the families they leave behind and the families who adopt them.<br />Milla Edge led a blessed life until the day her six week old infant, Justin, was stolen from her arms at a Mexican market.  Since that dreadful day she has spent her life searching for her son and other lost children.  Finally she gets a real lead regarding the whereabouts of Justin but she needs help. She turns to James Diaz (Diaz) a dangerous assassin whose reputation is more formidable than the enemies she seeks. Together they track the ruthless baby sellers and put their own lives at risk to find a child.<br />The story is well told and heartbreakingly real.  Make sure there are tissues nearby when you get to the final hundred pages.  I was interrupted several times while finishing this book and each time I returned to the story I cried more than the previous times.	2003-11-10

After reading Anne Frasier's first suspense thriller, 'Hush', I knew it would not be my last.  'Sleep Tight' has made me a true fan.  This taut psychological thriller combines well crafted characters, edge of your seat suspense, subtle romance and intelligent plotting.<br />FBI agent Mary Cantrell returns home to investigate the abduction and murder of two young women. There with the help of her friend and partner, Anthony Spence, she must find a killer and face her own demons.  Back in her childhood home living with with her mother and working with her younger sister,Gillian, now a law enforcement officer herself, Mary must finally let go of the past in order to solve these hideous crimes.<br />This story works on many levels.  Frasier paints a strong psychological portrait of Mary, a woman haunted by the murder of her friend and hurt by the betrayal of her sister. Mary's sister Gillian strives to assuage her self imposed guilt by bringing justice to others at any risk. Since Mary's recent gunshot wound while attempting to protect her partner, Anthony is consumed by fears for Mary's safety and by the realization that he cares for he much more than he'll admit. Frasier brings the past and the present together to tell a tale of betrayal and redemption that is fascinating and compelling. There is no doubt that I will continue to read anything that Anne Frasier writes.	2003-11-05

It follows the investigations of two highly skilled but disgraced secret service agents out to find the answers to the mysterious events that have been haunting them.<br />Sean King was an accomplished secret service agent until his attention wandered for just a 'Split Second' that changed his life.  Now a successful attorney he's living a quiet life in Virginia while continuing to dabble in law enforcement as a part time deputy sheriff.  Suddenly King discovers the dead body of a man in the witness protection program in his office and now he must find some answers before he becomes the lead suspect.<br />Michele Maxwell is the quintessential over achiever.  She's a Harvard grad, an attorney, an Olympic silver medalist, and a rising star in the secret service.  Then she makes a small error in judgement.  She allows her protectee to enter a funeral home alone, to pay his respects to the widow of his former mentor, and he is abducted. With her career in ruins Maxwell seeks answers which lead her to Sean King and some uncanny connections between two incidents almost a decade apart.<br />In 'Split Second' Baldacci has once again penned compelling characters and intriguing suspense.  He managed to take three seemingly unrelated events and seamlessly weave them into a spell binding mystery. Maxwell and King are extremely likable and convincing.  They reluctantly make a great pair of detectives with just a hint of romantic interest.  It is impossible to put this one down until the final culprits are revealed. I was glad to read that Baldacci is working on another book that will bring back King and Maxwell.	2003-11-04

It is a frightening subject that is deftly and realistically handled. The characters are so capably sculpted that you hate to leave them when the story ends.

The culprits are evident from the start and the outcome is never in question. The protagonist, Jade, the long lost daughter of wealthy entrepreneur Sam Cochrane now reunited with her adoring father is almost too good and virtuous to be true.  How could someone grow up on the streets without a single vice? Even her 'flaws' only seem to make her more attractive to the handsome and successful private eye, Luke Kelly, who finds and often rescues her.  Her protective and beautiful long time friend, Raphael, who is dying of aids is likened to Jesus on several occasions and he along with other cast members often spouts spiritual advice. The story though sappy at times moves quickly to a satisfying conclusion but it is not Sala's most memorable work.  If you are looking for pure romance then add a star because Sala's writing is always beautiful and the romance plentiful.	2003-10-11

In 'Remember When' J. D. Robb joins her alter ego Nora Roberts to write a two part story about a diamond heist which occurs early in the twenty first century when Jack O'Hara steals twenty eight million in glittering gems along with his friend willy Young and their ruthless and conniving associate Alex Crew.  When Crew turns on his associates Jack sends Willy to stash their part of the loot with his daughter Laine Tavish (formerly Elaine O'Hara) while he believes that he is lead Crew away.  However, Crew and a handsome private investigator, Max Gannon continue to pursue Laine.  Crew wants the diamonds at any cost while Max discovers that he needs Laine more than he needs to find the diamonds. Thus begins the search to find the elusive diamonds.<br />This first part of the tale is engrossing and sets up the second half which features Eve Dallas and Roarke as they investigate the death of a young woman that may be related to the recent publication of a book about the infamous heist of half a century ago. The murder occurred at the apartment of Samantha Gannon, the grand daughter of Laine and Max and revealed that in excess of seven million dollars worth of diamonds were never recovered.  Someone wants those gems now worth twice the original value and is willing to kill for them.  Together Eve and Roarke must find the culprit and avenge the murders.<br />Both parts of this tale are quite good and the doubleheader is well worth the investment in a hardcover edition.  I did slightly prefer the first part as it was more original and the characters were new and refreshing, but both parts were truly worth reading.	2003-09-27

Jack Farrar seems too good to be true but he is always there when Lola needs him, and along with her assorted guests they tackle the problem of finding Patrick and saving the Hotel Riviera.<br />Adler skillfully develops her plot and characters, slowly revealing small histories and traits until you find you have grown thoroughly attached and entirely too fond of them.

His beautiful prose enhances the intriguing plot with sharp and insightful narrative. Once again Iles has penned a winner with \\"The Footprints Of God\\". Dr David Tennant is appointed by the President as an ethics advisor to oversee Project Trinity, the creation of an artificial intelligence computer. When his good friend and associate on the project dies under suspicious circumstances David turns to his psychiatrist, Rachel Weiss.

Soon the two are embroiled in a life or death search for proof of evil doings at Trinity before the world is held hostage by the entity it has created.<br />In addition to a suspense filled thriller Iles has given the reader much to think about.

He also delves into the origins of religious belief and its relation to the creation of intelligent life on earth. <br />I found myself reading late into the night and wishing for more when I finished.

The eighth entry in Catherine Coulter's exciting FBI series it is not quite as well conceived as the first four, THE COVE, THE MAZE, THE TARGET and THE EDGE, but it is an improvement over the weaker recent entries HEMLOCK BAY and THE ELEVENTH HOUR.  In this episode Sherlock and Savich come to the aid of former FBI agent and friend Miles Kettering after his six year old son ,Sam, has been kidnapped. Sam manages to escape and is recovered by local sherrif and single mom, Katie Benedict. It is now up to Sherlock, Savich, Miles and Katie to discover the reasons for Sam's abduction and to apprehend the culprits. The story moves quickly along with the appropriate amounts of danger, suspense and romance to make a great summer read.  (I do agree, however, with a previous review that occasionally the relationship between Sherlock and Savich and their somewhat stilted dialogue slows rather than enhances the plot.) Overall this is another winner for Coulter.	2003-08-04

Being one of a set of twins myself this oft used theme is one that always gets to me.  I had confidence that Joyce would give a new and exciting twist to this over worked topic, but alas I was doubly disappointed.  The story is nicely written and certainly a quick read but the characters are one dimensional and the story lacks spirit.<br />Kait London is summoned by her long lost twin sister, Lana Coleman, and asked to switch places for two days to allow Lana the opportunity to find the money to pay off a loan shark who has threatened her and her daughter.  If we accept that Kait is willing and able to do this we must still ask why the family that abhors Lana is so easily won over by Kait.  Then there are the friends who all know about Lana's affairs, dislike Lana, and never suspect that something's amiss.  Even these problems would be acceptable if the story line were clever or intriguing, but it seems to just be dragging to the romantic finale.<br />Joyce's previous books are well worth your time but this one is just adequate.	2003-07-22

When she secretly retreats to an old cottage, belonging to a friend, on Shelter Island she is followed by Hank and by her stalker.

Brown's considerable skill in imparting remarkable tid bits of information in interesting ways is clearly evident in this early work.  Yes, he has improved but this first effort is well worth your time.<br />Brown's skills are not limited to teaching his audience about technology and encryption puzzles.  In addition to a cleverly crafted plot he creates characters whom his readers are eager to embrace. Susan Fletcher a brilliant and patriotic mathematician works for a secret government agency, NSA, that uses the latest computer technology to find and uncode terrorist messages. She and her lover, David Becker, a highly regarded university professor fluent in many languages, are faced with a crisis that tests their abilities and puts their lives at risk when a brilliant but confused ex agent develops a deadly encryption code. The clever twists and turns make pausing unthinkable until the situation is resolved.<br />The beauty of reading a novel by Dan Brown is in taking the time to enjoy his prose and all the information contained therein.

Is the father Jason Whitaker, her former beau and handsome TV newsanchor or is it a new unknown lover who she met in the three months she has been alone searching for herself.

Her intense investigation soon leads her to the determination that she is somehow the target of this psychotic killer.<br />Lacie enlists the aid of a renegade investigator,Nick St. James, to protect her and find the man she believes is responsible for the savage murder.

At least I knew what would become of Tara, Marc, Rachel and the other characters I'd grown to know and love. Yes, Harlan Coben's characters have certain similarities.  They are all slightly flawed, very human and trying to cope with circumstances far beyond anything they ever imagined could happen to them.  There is always a mysterious former lover who somehow arrives just at the right moment. There are always twists and turns in the plot that make you believe you've figured it out when you are being led as far astray as the characters.  Okay, its a little bit formulaic but its quite entertaining and exciting, and that's why I read suspense novels.	2003-05-02

Sparks has the ability to create authentic and appealing characters caught up in life altering situations that are heartwrenching and compelling.  In this work we have cardboard characters whose appeal to eachother is the only mystery to me. There is no suspense and the story rather than being emotional seems a parody of the romantic suspense genre with each character doing and behaving according to an established formula.<br />The history of each character is described in so dull a fashion that it is like reading a history text.  The reader never feels the 'Sparks' that makes his previous novels so compelling.  Read or reread one of Sparks previous books and wait for this one to come out in paperback.	2003-04-24

I first became a fan of Dennis Lehane with the Angela Gennaro/ Patrick Kenzie series.  With the publication of 'Mystic River' I was certain that I'd be disappointed but I was wrong. This week as I read 'Shutter Island' I doubted that Lehane could continue to impress me with his incredible writing skill.  I will never doubt again.<br />We are introduced to 'Shutter Island' by Dr. Lester Sheehan, a former psychiatrist at the facility, who in the twilight of his life is reminiscing about the four days in September of 1954 when U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels came to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando.  Rachel, an inmate of Ashcliffe Hospital for the criminally insane had escaped from the highly secure facility and was nowhere to be found on the island from which escape was thought to be impossible.  Teddy and his partner, Chuck Aule, are left with a cryptic message and many suspicions about what the doctors and staff at Ashcliffe might be hiding from the authorities.<br />In this well written and superbly crafted mystery the clues are there for us to solve, but I challenge anyone to solve this mystery before the final chapters. 'Shutter Island' is a must read for all mystery buffs.	2003-04-23
US	45911168	R3PB5DG2PCMTD7	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	5	42	56	N	N	Intelligent writing	Seldom in popular fiction do you find such intelligent writing as that produced by Dan Brown.  In addition to the superbly crafted mystery that we are privileged to enjoy it is as though you have attended a seminar on in this case art and religious iconology.<br />As Brown states at the start of his book, \\"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate. When I am reading a book by Dan Brown I never feel that I am wasting my time. You might ask if all this information bogs down the story and the answer is a resounding \\"NO\\".  Brown has the ability to take dry facts and present them in a fascinating way.  He also brilliantly weaves together many diverse threads into a coherent and intriguing plot.<br />We first met Professor Robert Langdon in Brown's previous thriller 'Angels And. Demons'. This book continues our acquaintance with the compulsive and brilliant Langdon and introduces the equally clever Sophie Neveu.  She is the estranged granddaughter of the curator of the Louvre, who is the victim of a savage murder. As he lays dying he leaves a cryptic message for his granddaughter and Langdon to decipher. Thrown together by the events that have occurred they must combine their considerable skills to solve the complex mystery before it is too late.<br />This book is a must read for mystery buffs and anyone who enjoys intelligent literature!	2003-04-14

The price was low enough that I thought it would be preferable to buy rather than take out of the library. I am so pleased that I did.  This book includes many of the best and most well known American works of art along with large, full color pictures and thumb nail sketches of the artist.  It is a great anthology to display or to use for some basic information when you or your children need it. Although the book is quite comprehensive I'm surprised at the amount of space allocated to some lesser artists while more significant contributors to American art are barely represented.  Despite that one disagreement with the author I highly reccommend this book.	2003-04-12

Jake is currently investigating the brutal murder of a young woman and when his investigation ties into Ashley's and into his partner's death the two are forced to work together.

Genny Madoc lives a simple life in Cherokee Pointe but her psychic abilities allow her to 'see' the murder and draw her into this investigation.  Dallas and Genny are strongly attracted to eachother as they search for a killer before he gets his fifth victim.<br />Although pleasantly presented this police procedural relies too heavily on the paranormal findings in decifering the case and finding the murderer.	2003-04-07

I was so impressed by that book that as soon as it was published I purchased 'The Darkness Gathers'.  I'm often disappointed when I revisit charachters of whom I am fond because the second attempt is rushed and not as clever. This new Lydia Strong mystery does not dissappoint.  It has the same crisp and somewhat dark style and well drawn characters.  The story is suspenseful and intriguing.

She so deftly portrays the issues that confront her protagonists that I am compelled to consider the effect that such issues (wether commonplace or unique) might have on myself or those whom I love.<br />In this story Jessie Ryder, an accomplished photojournalist, returns home to her family after a fifteen year absence when she learns that she is going blind.  There she must face the rebellious daughter, Lila, that she gave up to her sister, Luz, at birth and resolve the differences that have grown between herself and the sister she respects and loves.  She must also confront her own demons and deal with the fate that she has been dealt.<br />Wiggs creates a world that is as real as your own and populates it with strong and complicated characters that you will readily embrace.

Distraught, Leigh turns to the police only to find herself under suspicion and the department's efforts less than adequate. Tenacious detective Malcolm Shrader and novice detective Sam(antha) Littleton are not happy to be assigned to this case. They assure Leigh that Logan is probably temporarily trapped somewhere due to the after effects of the huge blizzard that contributed to Leigh's accident. It is not until Michael Valente, a recent business acquaintance of her missing husband with suspected criminal ties, shows an unusual interest in Leigh that the police begin to intensively investigate. Logan's frozen body is finally found with what at first appears to be a self inflicted bullet wound. The medical examiner quickly determines that Logan was murdered and the investigators focus on Leigh and Valente, who seems to be watching over Leigh.  The investigation and the romances wind to an exciting conclusion.<br /> McNaught's superb writing skills and well drawn characters and plot make this a book you will not want to miss.	2003-03-19

The title of this book, 'Body Of Evidence', led me to believe that there was some suspense or mystery to these somewhat weak tales of romance. I was wrong.  The murder is simply the means to bring the two lovers together.  The attempts at detailing any investigation are very superficial and would never lead to an arrest in the real world.  Then there are the characters, particularly in Jackie Merritt's tale.  They are actually annoying.  Who would ever love someone who always wimpers and tells you she is not attracted to you?  Justine Davis' selection is well written but cannot save the book. I will apologize to Pickart because I was too bored to start her episode.  The idea of following a murder from the beginning of the investigation until the verdict was compelling, but it was too hastily thrown together for my liking.	2003-03-17

She is irreverent, funny, courageous, intelligent and utterly compelling.  In this, her fifth appearance, Alex, a features writer for the Gabriel Monitor, is exiled to the neighboring town of Jaspersberg to cover the annual Melting Rock Music Festival. With four nights of loud music, annoying young kids and living in a tent to look forward to it doesn't seem like things can get any worse until the kids start dying from tainted LSD.<br />The deaths signal the end of Melting Rock but not of Alex's investigation.  It's soon evident that the deaths were not accidental. Then Alex notices that many of the people involved with Melted Rock and the drug scene are also part of a bizarre protest at the new Deep Lake Cooling Facility at Benson U.  Is there a connection? Why were the boys killed?<br />The aspect of this series that I enjoy most is the engaging dialogue between Alex and Cody, her significant other, and among Alex and her fellow reporters on the Monitor staff, Madison, O'Shaunessey, Ochoa, and ex Monitorite Gordon Band.  This reparte is so realistic and well constructed that I feel as if I've participated in the discussion and often find myself offering suggestions about how to proceed with the investigation. Of course, I'm never as clever as Alex and her cohorts but I have the pleasure of going along for the circuitous journey toward a final revelation.<br />If you have yet to read an Alex Bernier mystery start with 'Reliable Sources' and read them all in order.  If you're already a fan I know you'll enjoy this latest entry.	2003-03-15

The story takes us to Angel Fire New Mexico, a small town suddenly beset by a high number of missing persons, possibly a serial killer's doing. The problem is that the bodies are not found and the missing persons could have just fled. Lydia, in town to rest after the publication of her most recent true crime book, is certain that something sinister is afoot and she calls upon her friend and partner, ex FBI agent Jeffrey Mark, to help convince the authorities.

The reappearance in town of Tucker Quaid, the race car driver who was blamed for cuasing his father's death, starts Ron on a downward spiral of vandalism and delinquency.

When Quintana arrives at the resort with Gail Connors his fiance and sometimes cohort, they learn that Billy has attempted suicide after confessing to the police.

Parker masterfully establishes each charachter as a plausible suspect with both motive and opportunity.

Despite the obstacles in their path the relationship between Gail and Anthony continues to sizzle as they try to solve the mystery and maybe tie the knot.

When she arrives on the scene Detective Ray Doggett, who has been unable to identify the young woman, resorts to calling an unidentified number found in the victim's purse and Fiona's cell phone rings.  Fiona is horrified to discover that the victim is the daughter of her close friend and thus begins her involvement in this well plotted police story.  The relationship between Fiona and Ray though never in doubt is nicely drawn, but its the investigation that really keeps you guessing. I enjoyed this one!	2003-02-13

The premise strains the level of credibility for even the most die hard romantic. What are the odds that a dying entrepreneur (Carson Brooks) would ask his protege (Dylan Newport) to find his daughter (Sabrina Radcliffe) who is the product of a sperm donation 32 years ago and that said daughter would be a successful management consultant who happily offers her new found dad one of her kidneys in order to save his life. In addition she takes over as president of his corporation and falls in love with his protege. This is just the beginning of this very tall tale, but if you can accept the premise the story is fun. Its worth reading when you have some extra time on your hands.	2003-02-11

Of course you have to like underdeveloped and bland main characters and a plot with little suspense and no real fire between the protagonists.

Valence St. Charles grew up wild on the streets of New Orleans two of which she is named for. Now, she has her life on track and is an expert on Asian Antiquities. She is particularly interested in the famous collection owned by the illusive T'ang Jian-Shan.  In an attempt to gain access to these famous swords she manages to enter his property and save Jian-Shan and his young daughter Lily from an assasination attempt. This act embroils Val in the desperate battle between Jian-Shan, his father, a ruthless  Tong leader, and American Government agents, and leads her to a searing and passionate relationship with Jian.<br />This story works on many levels.  The history of the Tong leadership and the priceless sword collections is facsinating. The many characters are very well drawn, especially Valence and Jian-Shan for whom we are rooting throughout the story.  The suspense kept me reading until late in the night and then waking early to finish.  This is the first I've read of Jessica Hall (though I wouldn't be surprised if she's written under another name) and I am looking forward to the next book in this trilogy, 'The Steel Caress'.	2003-02-09

In addition when informed at age thirty two that her father (the sperm donor) is now the most successful businessman alive she not only embraces him, but offers him one of her kidneys, takes over as president of his multimillion dollar enterprise and falls for his protege.

Karen trusts the senator but is disturbed by the hidden agendas that impede her investigation.  As each is drawn into the deepening suspense and political agendas they form a tenuous relationship that is strongly tested before the final resolution.

Gabrielle works as a prison guard while raising her one year old daughter despite being offered alimony from her too good to be true ex husband.  There she meets and tries to protect Randall Tucker, a resident of the prison where she was a guard.  He was falsely accused of killing his wife and now desperately wants to get out to be with his eight year old son, Landon.  Tucker escapes while in the custody of Gabrielle and another guard during a transfer to a more secure prison. Gabrielle single handedly tries to recapture her escaped prisoner and somehow falls in love instead.<br />There are times when the relationship is satisfying but for the most part the plot is weak the suspense sparse and the conclusion far too easy and contrived.	2003-02-04

Happily, I was just as intrigued with the story and the relationships this time. Once I began reading I was unable to stop until the surprising conclusion.<br />This story begins with the murder/suicide of an unknown man and a young woman that San Francisco Homicide Inspector Kate Gillespie knew well once upon a time. As Kate and her new partner Rocky Markowsky investigate the deaths become more suspicious.  Everyone has something to hide including Kate. Kate initially begs to be removed from this case to which she has so many unhappy associations. However, when she is asked to step aside she is unable to let go of her investigation despite the fact that someone is trying to make her stop permanently.<br />Burcell's characters are so well developed that you feel like you know them. They are also intelligent, dedicated, honest but flawed just enough that you really want to know them.<br />The on again off again relationship between Kate and Mike Torrance adds spice to the story, and I would like to see it progress further in the next installment.  My only objection is that the book wasn't long enough.	2003-02-01

Her sleasy agent, Valdor, desperately wants her to return to painting, something that she has not done since the miraculous surgery that removed a brain tumor and rid her of the horrible nightmares that were the subject of her incredible works of art.  The residous of that surgery is a limp and mild  facial paralysis along with end of her career as an artist.<br />Now an adult she lives in fear of an unknown stalker and relies upon her parents and the dog, Jagger, her father had specially trained for her security.  John Rubidoux (Ruby) is the ex policeman who reluctantly trained Jagger despite misgivings about the mixed signals that would be sent to this gentle golden retriever.

As their relationship develops Charlie's tumor seems to be returning along with the nightmares and the stalker appears to be even more determined to get Charlie.<br />The story takes many turns but neatly finds its way to climactic conclusion. Forrest sets up  enough possible culprits to keep you guesssing for quite a while.

I had never heard of Nora Roberts and was not a romance fan. This story introduced me to Roberts and romance.<br />The plot revolves around Dora Conroy, a quirky proprietor of a small antique shop, who inadvertently interferes with the illegal shipment of some smuggled artwork and becomes the target of a ruthless and deadly businessman. Her new tenant Jed Skimmerhorn, an ex detective with the Philadelphia PD, is reluctantly attracted to Dora and feels obligated to protect her when the bad guys break into her apartment and threaten her. Add Dora's spirited family of actors and their bizarre show biz friends into the mix and you have the recipe for fun.<br />The story is at times humorous, often suspenseful, very romantic and always a great read.

Samantha is thrilled to meet her brother but he is not sure about her.  She also has various aunts, uncles and cousins and one of them does not want her to be included in her dying father's will.<br />FBI agent Nathan McLean is yearning to take down Samantha's entire new crime family, but finds himself smitten by Sam. Their relationship blossoms despite each one's hidden agendas.  When trouble inevitably finds Samantha she must determine who she can trust, Nathan or Nick.<br />The outcome is not surprising, but the ride is fun. Potter writes a good story and her characters are very likeable.  It is certainly worthy of a few hours on a cold night.	2003-01-03

At home she encounters Fegan Broussard, her friend's brother who believes Claire's father to be guilty but finds himself strangely attracted to his little sister's best friend.  Claire's search for evidence does not sit well with the town of Evangeline.  She soon finds that she is putting her life on the line and that she must rely on Fegan Broussard to whom she is reluctantly attracted.<br />The story is well told.

She, though not a suspect, is implicated and must lie to protect her mother from police investigation.  That scrutiny comes in the form of a very attractive detective, John Ryan.  The attraction is immediate for both but Abbie cannot confide in Ryan because of her allegiance to her mother.  In addition Ryan and his partner are concerned with  the serial killer who is molesting and murdering young boys in the  Princeton area.<br />Ryan finally discovers Abbie's connection to the murder case he's investigating and helps to prove her mother's innocense.  Their relationship develops and all is well until Ben is kidnapped. Noone knows whether the kidnapping is related to the serial killer or to the blackmail scheme.  Does it seem unlikely that two such ominous events would be centered around one town and one family? Sure, but this is romantic suspense.<br />Though at times incredible the tale is well told and makes for good light reading.	2003-01-01

It seems NASA has made an amazing discovery that might secure the dubious future of the organization and revitalize the President's flagging campaign.<br />The interesting detail contributes to the realism in this fascinating story of political rivalry.  Frequently writers research the topic about which their plot revolves to the point that we are bored to death but Brown injects his factual material in a surprisingly interesting manner.  It enhances the plot and makes the incredible aspects of the story appear to be true. By the time I finished this book I had learned a great deal about NASA, Sattelite surveillance, new and imaginary military weapons,  asteriods, and deep sea  exploration and enjoyed it all.	2002-12-22

The three stories were written in the eighties and they remind you that Roberts has always been an exceptional writer. The stories were selected to fit the title- 'Dangerous' and in each story the main character is faced with a dangerous situation and a partner of the opposite sex to help solve their mystery.<br />In 'Risky Business' Jonas Sharpe is looking for the person who murdered his twin brother.  His only link to the murderer might be Liz Palmer, the dive shop owner and single mother for whom his brother was working at the time of his death.<br />Autumn Gallagher arrives at her Aunts' Inn for a long awaited visit.

She has some money in a trust fund and earns a living by doing computer research for distant clients. David spends his time on the computer or reading about astronomy, but he wants to live a more normal life.  Her landlord, Jack Verrity, is an ex cop with problems of his own.  He befriends David and wonders about the kid's attractive but distant mother.<br />Though, for David's sake, Thea tries to interact with Jack she is too scarred and scared by her traumatic past to accept a man' presence.  Then David runs away to search for his biological father.  Thea and her deceased mother have kept the truth about his birth from David but somehow he has discovered that he was conceived on Long Island.  At first Thea blames Jack, but soon she is forced to join forces with Jack in the search for her son.<br />This is a complex story and Darian North provides frightening insight into the obsessive fears and uncontrollable behaviors that are the result of the trauma of rape.

Her fiance becomes annoyed with her strong racial leanings and her strong career ambitions. Her renewed relationship with Julian makes her question her decision to marry Phillip.  Julian will stop at nothing to win Taylor back and to protect her. The white supremists will stop at nothing to murder her.<br />The story is well drawn but sometimes contrived in order to make its point both philosophically and in terms of plot lines.

The search takes Rina and Peter to Israel where we are treated to a fascinating tour of the West Bank and the diamond trade in Israel.  What makes this entry so important today is the portrayal of the continuing conflict and violence that shapes Israel's future and her people. It is a pleasure to read a book that is both thoughtful and fun to read.<br />My only other suggestion if you are new to Faye Kellerman is to start at the beginning with 'Ritual Bath' to see the relationship between Rina and Peter unfold. Then read all her books in the order in which they were written.  Its a great series.	2002-12-11

I really enjoyed the first two, 'The Road To Hidden Harbor' by Anne Stuart and 'Remember Me' by Joanna Wayne. The third 'Primal Fear' by Caroline Burns was okay but slower and a bit disjointed.<br />In Joanna Wayne's tale Dr. Nathan Wayne is smitten by his new patient, a young woman who has just saved the life of a two year old child and endangered her own in so doing.  Jill Jacobs is rushed into surgery for a subdural hematoma and as Nathan watches his patient awake from the anesthesia he is certain he knows her.  The story of her heroism makes local headlines and even appears on the national cable news network.  Rather than  enjoying her celebrity status Jill is terrified and Nathan wants to know why. He also begins to suspect he knows who she really is and he wants to renew his relationship.  His investigation and Jill's sudden fame put their lives in jeopardy as their romance blossoms. This is a beautiful story and my favorite of the three. This one deserves five stars!<br />In Anne Stuart's contribution Professor Molly Ferrell travels to Hidden Harbor, Maine to complete the research for her book about her favorite obscure writer, 'a long dead poet', Michael O'Flannery. Her obsession with O'Flannery intensifies when it seems the whole town is hiding the truth of his mysteriuos death from her.  When she meets Jake Marley, the carpenter at the bed and bath she's staying at things begin to heat up and danger is not far behind. This one is also a good read. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.<br />I did not enjoy 'Primal Fear' as much as the first two stories but others might and its included at no extra charge.  All in all this is a good deal.	2002-12-11

The story is so good that I was able to accept the surrealistic premise.  John Waters first sees Eve Sumner, a local real estate agent, across the soccer field while watching his daughter play. Her words and actions eerily remind him of his deceased former lover, Mallory Gray Candler.  Subsequent encounters lead him into a torrid affair with Eve, who he is more and more certain is possessed by the soul of Mallory.  As Waters becomes involved with 'Eve' he realizes that he is endangering his family both emotionally and physically by his continued obsession with her.  In fact it may already be too late to disentangle himself from his insatiable lover. Then Eve is murdered and Waters is the most likely suspect.  What is worse is that he is still not free from Mallory's threats. He must find a way to save his marriage, his child and his wife. The twists and turns at the end make it impossible to guess how it is resolved.  As usual Greg Iles' writing is difficult to put down and his characters are so well drawn that you hate to leave them.	2002-12-09

After shoveling my long driveway and walk and feeding the kids (who had arrived home from an early school closing), I settled down to read 'On Thin Ice'.  It is the perfect escape on a cold and snowy day.  Sasha Miller is a professional ice skater who has finally put behind her a difficult childhood and a drug scandal early in her olympic career.  Then once again addicts begin dying from tainted drugs like those distributed by her ex partner and best friend who is now finishing a five year jail term for his illegal actions.  Mick Vinicor, a DEA agent is sent undercover to investigate the primary suspect, Sasha.  He is immediately attracted to the beautiful and talented skater and ultimately finds it hard to believe that she is guilty.  The attraction is mutual, but Sasha is less trusting. She must also sort out her feelings for Lon Morrison, her ex partner who is now out of jail and back in the Ice Follies with her.  When the follies are beset by strange accidents that seem to be directed at Sasha, Mick realizes that he must find the real culprit before its too late.<br />The premise is simple and there are few surprises but the characters are so likeable (as is the romance) that its fine for a cold winter day.	2002-12-06

If you are considering the purchase of this book and have not read the earlier (superior) entries in this series, I recommend that you procure earlier works, especially 'Ritual Bath', 'Milk And Honey', 'Grievous Sin&quot;, 'False Prophet' and 'Sanctuary'.  These books show the true measure of Kellerman's writing skills.  That said I thought this book was pretty good.  It takes us back to Borough Park and Decker's biological roots and continues to explore the relationship between Peter (Decker) and Rina (Lazarus) and their families.  I was disappointed with 'The Forgotten' and 'The Stalker' so I'm glad I was able to enjoy this latest tale. However, I still urge anyone who has not read Kellerman's earlier works to do so now.

Mobius has been dormant for several years when Tess gets a summons from her former boss, Assistant Director Gerald Andrus, bringing her to L.A. to investigate a suspect who seems frighteningly similar to Mobius.  At the same time a suspect in another FBI investigation turns up dead and the nerve gas she is carrying disappears.  Again the M.O. of the murder is reminiscent of Mobius.  Are these cases related and do they have anything to do with Mobius?  Can a sociopath evolve into a terrorist who will unleash the nerve gas onto the unsuspecting L.A.populace?  More important will Tess find Mobius before he puts his plans into effect?  The story twists and turns until the satisfying conclusion.  Although it lacks some of the charachter development and emotional impact of his previous works I enjoyed 'Next Victim' as I do all of Prescott's books.	2002-11-24

Along the way he encounters the most bizarre group of fellow travelers, the most talented and loyal train crew imaginable, a blizzard, an avalanche, a film crew and a wedding party. His travels become a journey of self discovery when he encounters Eleanor (Ellie) Carter, the only woman he ever truly loved but lost many years ago.  I haven't ridden the rails recently but my cousin has and she assures me this is not typical, but this is fiction.  Baldacci treats us to a fascinating history of train travel and some very amusing stories while establishing his plot and introducing all his characters. The story is heart warming holiday fare and I enjoyed the ride immensely.	2002-11-15

She and her eight year old son, Ryan, are isolated but content in their northern California community until Ryan is kidnapped from his school.  Now Cody must risk everything to find Ryan before it is too late.  Ever since the witness protection program failed her, cody has relied only upon her own skills and resources to protect herself and her son.  Now she must trust others once again if she is to find Ryan in time.  But she must also determine who she can trust.<br />Danielle Girard creates characters that you really want to get to know and tells a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat from cover to cover.  I really enjoyed her previous books, 'Chasing Darkness', 'Ruthless Game', and 'Savage Art', so I could not wait to read 'Cold Silence'.  It is worth the wait!	2002-11-10

It was so well written that I picked up a couple of her historical romances.  Despite not particularly finding historical romances enjoyable I have to admit that I liked them.  Now I've read 'Passing Through Paradise' and I hope Wiggs writes many more contemporary romances. She's just so good at it. This one is about Sandra Winslow, a children's book author and the widow of a politician who died in a tragic and suspicious automobile accident which Sandra survived.  She cannot recall the circumstances of the accident or how she survived and soon becomes the leading suspect and a pariah in the town of Paradise.  In order to flee from Paradise she must restore and sell her beach house, the only asset she retained following  her husband's death.  She meets Mike Malloy, a contractor who agrees to do the restoration for her despite his doubts about her innosense.  As Wiggs slowly reveals the actual events surrounding the accident she also explores the complex relationships between Mitch and Sandra, Sandra and her loving but estranged parents, and between Mitch, his young children and his ex wife.  Wiggs brings all her characters and thier problems to life and keeps her readers entranced until the last surprising page.  I can't wait for her next contemporary novel.	2002-11-05

In addition to there being very little plot we are expected to shell out [more of our hard earned cash] to find the conclusion of this story.  If Hooper wanted to receive [profit] for her book it would have been more honest had she produced one volume and allowed readers to decide wether to pay for her story.

Is that supposed to make someone like you?  There are other ridiculous circumstances in the book but to discuss these would divulge plot and I will not do that.

Her attempts to help bring her into the lives of Brian and his politically connected family.  Of course, there are people who do not want Julia to meddle into their affairs. She soon finds that her life is at risk as she searches for the answers to Brian's problems.

Sarah Jane Whitman is a succesful restauranteur but she still feels the stigma of having had a father who embezzled a million from his bank and ran off, allowing his wife and child to suffer the consequences.  Her mother committed suicide shortly after leaving Sarah alone with her shame.  Twenty years later the father's body is found and Sarah realizes that she has misjudged her father.  Determined to prove his innocence to the town that scorned her family she returns to Marmet,Maine and in so doing stirs up more trouble than she can handle. Tony (Silk) Demarco has long regretted not having been there for the daughter of the only man in Marmet, Maine to believe in him.  Now a wealthy nightclub owner in Chicago Tony returns home to support Sarah, who was just a girl when he last saw her and discovers more than he bargained for.  Everyone Sarah meets is a suspect; someone wants her out of the picture for good; and Tony wants more than just to protect her.  The story has too much formula and there's little suspense but it's an enjoyable read with likable characters.	2002-10-30

She immediately befriends his teenage daughter, Heather, who is dealing with some severe problems of her own.  Trusting Mick is more difficult, but she needs his help to find the truth and he needs her help to understand his troubled daughter.  I really enjoyed this book.

After picking up \\"Last Breath\\" at the airport on my vacation last year and finding it to be a riveting read I decided to try another book by Michael Prescott.  \\"Comes The Dark\\" deals with a similar topic- the twisted mind of a serial killer- and does it even better.  Prescott drops you into the mind of Robert Garrison as he captures and plans to murder his sister Erica in order to cleanse his soul and eradicate his demons.  The result is a rollercoaster ride of suspense and pathos as Erica's secret lover, the local police chief, races to find her before its too late.  Robert plans to kill her 'comes the dark'. Despite knowing who the guilty party was I found myself sitting at the edge of my seat until the ride ended.	2002-10-28

The narrator, Tara Chatterjee, is divorced after an arranged marriage to Bishwapriya (Bish) Chatterjee, the first son of a privileged Indian family and now a silicon valley billionaire in his own right. She is now a single parent raising their son, Rabi, in an ethnically mixed San Francisco neighborhood.  Having embraced the American culture of her contemporaries Tara is living with Andy, a Hungarian, Bhuddist,ex biker,and carpenter.  She is at peace with her existence although she finds it difficult to explain her Calcutta roots to her American friends and to describe her American lifestyle to her Bengali parents.<br />Tara returns to her home one day to find her son with a stranger claiming to be her nephew, the son of her oldest sister and a classmate from their childhood.  The story he tells is compelling, but there is also the possibility that it is a scam.  In order to unravel the mystery of this affair she is forced to confront her sisters and to reassess her relationships and values in the face of possible danger to herself and those closest to her.<br />The rich descriptions of Tara's Calcutta childhood and her involvement in the Indian American community complement the engaging tale, although at time these descriptions are too detailed and unecessarily delay the story.  The conflicting philosophies of Tara and her sisters add to the character of the book and to our understanding of the plight of immigrant groups in our country.  However \\"Desirable Daughters\\" is most effective as simply a compelling and thought provoking story.	2002-10-26

Harper Cole, a successful trader and computer aficionado, is  the protagonist and narrator of this tale. He is a flawed but nice guy who is trying to hide the mistakes of his past and by so doing is allowing himself and his family to be drawn into the dangerous games of a psychopathic genius. The more he tries to protect himself the deeper the hole he digs.  We are allowed to understand Coles motivations and feelings so completely that I did not object, as I usually do, to the poor decisions he made that drove the plot and created the relentless suspense in this novel.  I found myself staying up into the wee hours of the night to find out what would become of the characters that I had come to know and like.  However, what separates this book from other suspense novels is how beautifully it is written.  The conversations between Cole and his physician wife, Drewe, between Cole and his strange friend, Miles, and all his on line conversations are such beautiful prose that they alone are worth the purchase price.	2002-10-20

I purchased 'The Crush' as soon as it was available and read it immediately.  Sure I had high expectations, but even considering that fact, this book is not up to Brown's recent standards.  'Envy', 'The Switch','Exclusive','The Witness','French Silk' and 'The Alibi' are well written and have much more carefully crafted plots.  Try those if you want a good story.  This story was reminiscent of Brown's earlier writing, using the story just to get to the romantic conclusion.	2002-10-09

Instead I'll gladly settle settle for reading Alex's exploits.  'Reliable Sources' is a great introduction to Alex and her small but compelling gang of cohorts.  The book which involves an unauthorized investigation by Gabriel Monitor reporter Alex Bernier into the supposed suicide of her lover and friend is refreshingly well told.

I have enjoyed all her previous books, but this one was easily my favorite. Smith weaves the tale into extensive historical context of WWII counterintelligence and the Israeli Moussad. The saga begins when Gillian Meade returns home to confront her mother (Grace) about some historical data that she has uncovered while researching a World War II exhibit for the Smithsonian Museum, where she is employed. Their home is burned to the ground. Grace Meade is found dead and Gillian semi conscious and suicidal. Alex Cruz, an FBI agent arrives to investigate a related matter and is drawn into the dark tale surrounding these two women's lives.

The plot is suspenseful and engaging.  The characters are so compelling that I couldn't stop at just one Barbara Parker novel.  I've now read the entire series Connor/Quintana series.  In addition to her characters Parker's depiction of Miami gives the reader a real appreciation of the town and its underlying conflicts.  I can't wait for the next installment.	2001-06-28

I have liked some of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books so I was amazed at just how poorly this book was written.  Because it was a costly hardcover book, and because I could not believe there wouldn't ultimately be some redeeming value, I forced myself to finish reading this book.  However, there is nothing good to say about this book, so I will say no more.	2001-04-23

I will not retell the story because I do not like it when people tell me more than I want to know.  However, the characters were vivid and the first person naration made me feel as if I were along for the ride. Not only do I completely disagree with the many poor reviews, but I believe some people put in their opinion several times.	2001-04-07

If you decide to read this book, and you should, I recommend that you immediately purchase all five Kenzie/Gennaro books by Dennis Lehane.  You will not be able to put them down until you've finished the entire series, and then you'll wish there were more.  Lehane's dialogue is crisp and clever; his plots though dark are always hopeful and well crafted.  Ultimately its the relationship between the protagonists that makes this novel unforgettable.	2001-03-04

I read this book in one day. I was never bored.  The story was well told and the characters were really likeable.	2001-01-09
