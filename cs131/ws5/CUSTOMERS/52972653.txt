Grant pretty much hates everything written in the last twenty-five years, hates rock and pop music, and thinks musicals should have stopped evolving during the 50s. He contends that there's only one way to create a musical, that anything that doesn't follow the Rodgers and Hammerstein model isn't really a musical, that concept musicals aren't musicals, in short, that this amazing art form should never change from what it was in the 40s and 50s.    His narrow and oddly grouchy take on this most American art form will either make you angry or depressed. If it does, just remember that he's WRONG -- the American musical has never been healthier or more vigorous, in regional theatres all over America, in Canada and Europe, and occasionally when we're lucky, even on Broadway...   :)	2005-07-07

This one is angry, bitter, cranky, condescending, and not terribly well written. The book's organization is messy at best, his right-wing politics needlessly intrusive, and his opinion of current musical theatre offensive and closed-minded. In fact, the musial theatre is healthier, more exciting, more inventive than at almost any other time in history. At what other time did we have brilliant experiments like Urinetown, Bat Boy, Songs for a New World, The Last Five Years, Avenue Q, A New Brain, Euphoria, Dream True, A Light in the Piazza, etc.? Mordden is just a fuddy-duddy who can't see what a glorious time this is for the art form.	2004-10-29

Many of the author's arguments -- pretty much seeing lesbian overtones EVERYWHERE -- are a bit silly, but she also makes some good points. It's a point of view we rarely hear so that's worth something, and may get some people thinking about musicals differently, which is worthwhile...	2004-05-02

This book seemed so exciting when I ordered it. But this author doesn't understand musical theatre. He doesn't really know the art form; he just knows a bit about it. So much of the book is so condescending and so dismissive toward a lot of oustanding musicals. And there are so many small factual errors that I have to wonder if he's really seen some of the shows he writes about. Was there no one to proof this book? Did no one reading it know that there is no Oscar for &quot;best soundtrack&quot;? And in addition to factual errors, Singer also fudges the truth from time to time to support his pre-existing conclusions. He doesn't seem to have much respect for the art form, and from what I can tell from his book jacket bio, he's never worked in the musical theatre, so he has virtually no interesting insights into how musicals work. Though there is a bit of useful info in the book, there are far better books than this. Don't bother.	2004-05-02

It also covers two shows by future writing stars of musical theatre, Adam Guettel and Jason Robert Brown, giving us sort of a preview of what's ahead for the art form. And it also contains two major classics, Pal Joey and Oklahoma. The back cover says it's a tour of ground-breaking musicals and that's really what it is, you get to see how the art form changed over time, and it's arranged chronologically to make that even more clear. This is a great read, as much fun and as conversational as the other books, but even more insightful about the art form of musical theatre. Also, the author apparently expanded the chapter on Hair into a full-length book which I have not read but I intend to.	2003-12-14

The author clearly doesn't understand the art form well enough to write an entire book about it. His credentials - that he has directed twenty-five productions - aren't very impressive. Many community theatre directors in the US have directed twenty-five shows. So what? Does that make them all qualified to write a book? <br />Also, strangely, the photos in the book are either from movie versions of shows (even when the movie version is not faithful to the original) or from what appears to be medicore community theatre productions. Why use photos from movie versions when discussing the original stage version? How does that help? The most cofusing thing about the photos is that they often appear in the middle of chapters in which those shows are not even mentioned. <br />The author's contention that &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; is shallow indicates the level of his understanding of contemporary musical theatre. I can understand someone not liking &quot;Sunday&quot; for one reason or another, but to say it's shallow means this guy doesn't understand challenging, mature musical theatre. That he thinks &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; was influential means he doesn't understand the evolution of the art form either -- &quot;Yankee&quot; was an ordinary musical that excised most of the depth and the social satire of its source material. <br />In short, don't bother with this book -- there are plenty others that do a far better job.	2003-04-13

I counted more than 50 factual errors, misspellings, grammar errors, homonym errors, misidentified songs, directors, chracters, relationships, dates -- and those are just the ones I caught. This book needs an editor and a fact checker, and the author needs to learn to spell Anne Bancroft's name, among others.<br />It's an interesting subject, but how can you take the book seriously or trust any of its information when its riddled with mistakes?

Its central point is terribly obvious and fairly unnecessary, and if the point HAS to be made (over and over), it could have been made easily in ten pages. After reading the book, I see that when McCabe talks about directors misinterpreting plays, what he REALLY means is directors interpreting plays differently than how HE interprets those plays. And he seems to have virtually no credentials to back up his rants. He hates dramaturgs, readings, workshops, backstory, blah, blah, blah. So who cares? I'm not sure why he's so angry and so bitter, but this horrific pandemic of rebel directors raping good plays, against which he rails, doesn't actually exist. Still, the book was interesting in some unexpected ways (sometimes for unintentional entertainment value) even though it holds no real value in any ongoing discussion of American theatre.

The REAL, original texts of the Bible don't condemn homosexuality at all -- in fact, they never even MENTION it. Therefore, there is no need for serious, sincere Chrsitians to be &quot;cured&quot; of being gay (as if that were even possible). Luckily, this kind of pretentious, hateful, exclusionary, bigoted Christianity is in the minority. As a serious Christian, this book embarrasses me. As a human being, it fills me with pity for its authors.

After the first act, you realize you're watching a well-wrought play, populated by strong, quirky characters, interesting situations, and fascinating, complex relationships, all the things you expect from Wilson. But it doesn't seem like the best play he's ever written, as quite a few people have claimed. With works like Fifth of July, Burn This, and Redwood Curtain in his canon, Best Ever is quite a claim. Then you see Act II. And you realize they might just be right. All the groundwork laid in Act I pays off in such abundantly satisfying ways. And there's so much more to this play than you thought. There is the temptation to fault Book of Days for its loose construction and seemingly scattershot laying out of scenes, but that's where its real beauty lies, in the poetry of the ordinary, in the unexpected turns life takes, in the randomness of living. The organization of the play is in its characters and in its themes of ambition, the need to know, and the fear of change. With plainly theatrical devices sprinkled throughout the show - characters narrating the show, watching from the sides, stepping out of scenes to directly address the audience - this is not trying to be kitchen sink drama. It is a play uniquely American and just as uniquely Lanford Wilson. It is what it says it is, a book of days, a diary, a story to be told, with characters at once good and bad, admirable and not. It's a snapshot of small town American life at the end of the millennium, in some ways not so different from big city life, in some ways light years away.	2000-11-25

While I enjoyed the novel to some extent, it's only slightly above average and I really could see no similarities between Rent and People in Trouble, other than the coincidences that are inevitable from the two books being set in similar times and places. Since the similarity between the two is the basis for Stage Struck, I find this book even more worthless than I did before. Having now compared the two works for myself, I now have even less respect for Shulman, and am even more convinced that this book (Stage Struck) is nothing more than an excuse for a rant and a way to cash in on someone else's success.	2000-11-25
