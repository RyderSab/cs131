US	52944767	R2JQLCRE4DFOHN	0374199639	64824201	The Metaphysical Club : A Story of Ideas in America	Books	3	18	28	N	N	Interesting, but limited	The liner notes on the jacket-cover make this book seem more coherent than it actually is.  According to the cover, Menand aims to show that pragmatism is uniquely American.  But to really show how uniquely American it is, he needs to tell us about other countries and discuss what their thinkers were coming up with.  I have a strong suspicion that if he took a look at Britain and France during the same period (1870 to 1930, approximately), he would find just as many &quot;pragmatic&quot; thinkers who were skeptical of ideology and were influenced by scientific thinking.  The difference is, he would also find more ideologues.  He would probably find more intellectuals of all stripes in Europe at that time.<br />But perhaps the book doesn't aim to show how unique pragmatism is to the US.  Maybe it just wants to tell a story of how American pragmatism came about.  If so, I wish it were a smoother read.  I found it kind of plodding.<br />Glad I read it though.  And interesting and ambitious project.  I will keep looking out for new Menand titles.	2002-05-03

Like &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; (and unlike &quot;Rabbit Redux&quot;) this novel can be read as a standalone and be rewarding.	2002-01-06
US	52944767	R2EN9FPPHZLR4K	0449911659	437546793	Rabbit, Run	Books	5	23	25	N	N	Compassionate realism: a young man reaches the end of youth	What makes &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; such a staggering masterpiece is -- paradoxically -- its very ordinariness.<br />The novel is about a former high school basketball star, now married, with a family, who is finding his adult life claustrophobic.  He misses his youth -- the adrenaline rush of sports, the sense that life is full of possibilities.  He doesn't know what to do about it.  He tries to make some kind of change, with what's left of his youthful energy. He's self-centered, but he's also a dreamer.<br />The book is sad, in that it offers no &quot;solution&quot; to the frustration of leaving youth behind.  But it's also reassuring and poignant, because the theme is so universal.<br />Updike manages to keep this apparently ordinary story interesting without being philosophical or tedious.  His vivid, compassionate descriptions of characters and their neighborhoods are phenomenal.  He has a way of illuminating the inner workings of American optimism (sports heroes, suburban consumer culture) without looking down on it.  In fact, he seems to cherish it, focusing his lens on the  unspoken dreams that make our society and our personalities what we are.<br />This book -- along with its sequels -- is one of the great pieces of American literary art.<br />PS If that's not enough to grab you, read it for Updike's incomparable descriptions of lovemaking.  Arrestingly specific and vivid.  Only a handful of authors can actually describe sex -- I mean, really describe it -- and show the way people's personalities are played out in bed just like they are anywhere else.  The main character is a charismatic, self-absorbed yearner, in search of his lost youth at all times -- even during sex.  In Updike's world, sex isn't pornographic -- it's part of life.	2002-01-06

But all the same... He may be right anyway.<br />Like all of Vidal's history novels (even &quot;Julian&quot;), &quot;Burr&quot; captures the tone of  an aristocrat looking out at a society gradually becoming less aristocratic.  (Of course, that's because Vidal looks at the world this way himself.)  The way Andrew Jackson is described is so offensive and negative, you have to laugh.  But I'm sure everyone from Jefferson to Burr to Adams viewed Jackson this way at the time.<br />To me, one of the refreshing aspects of this book is how uncompromising its attitude is.  Burr is portrayed as a man who does not gloss over his ambition with pseudo-philosophy like Jefferson.  He marries a prostitute because he feels like it; prostitution is the norm in his era, but so is prudishness.  Burr  simply refuses to be prudish.  When he describes George Washington, he tells us that he had a long torso, so he looked good on horseback--which may account for much of why he was an effective leader even though he kept relentlessly losing battles.  I'm glad the book just comes right out and says these things.  It's healthy to remember that the exalted founding fathers were for the most part just politicians.<br />All in all, this is an extroardinarily fun romp through history by a writer with a keen intellect.	2002-01-06

This time, they've retired and moved to Florida.  It's very funny.  They dress the way people do when they retire and move to Florida.  The kids and grandkids are visiting, and the plot gets complicated and compelling (family dynamics, shouting matches...)<br />The characters are portrayed with precision, compassion, and elegance.  The writing in the first half of the novel is magnificent, and the pace is gripping.  I found it hard to put down.  The second half, however, seemed a bit redundant and slow to me.  However, I'll grant that the subject matter is a little alien because of my under-50 age; I may understand it better in years to come.<br />These books age well.  Updike is really something special.	2002-01-06

This breathtaking book tells the story of a man with an intense and relentless need to prove his total self-sufficiency.  He takes his family to the Honduran jungle to show the world (and himself) how clever he is at solving any problem that could ever come his way.  The family soon discovers, however, that the jungle is not so undisturbed or idyllic as the father had fantasized--and that surviving by one's wits might not even be a realistic idea in the first place.<br />Narrated from the point of view of the man's teenage son, the book explores the meaning of connectedness and self-sufficiency, as well as the dangers of individualism and competitiveness.  One wonders, when reading the book, why the father has such a craving to prove his self-worth. His son struggles desperately to understand him, but like the other characters, he is so overwhelmed by his father's powerful personality that he finds no alternative to following him.<br />&quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; raises some very unusual and compelling questions.  How equipped are we, as human beings, to live isolated from community?  What is the nature of cleverness and intelligence?  Also, what does it mean that certain forceful personalities, &quot;guru&quot; types, can get others to do their bidding even when they're somewhat deranged?<br />A very memorable read.	2002-01-06

Still worth reading, though.<br />The book would have been as good as the others if the supporting characters were not so embarrassingly stereotypical (especially Skeeter, the almost offensively caricatured unpredictable angry black man).  Updike sometimes seems to be trying to get into their heads as effectively as he does with Rabbit's own family, but he doesn't succeed -- and the plot goes over the line into unbelievability too, in my opinion.<br />All that said, this book is full of memorable scenes and characters, and Updike has caught the mood of what a man in Rabbit's situation, and at Rabbit's age, would be feeling.  The prose style is also no longer poignant and melancholy like that of &quot;Rabbit, Run,&quot; but is more vigorous and sharp--which fits the scene he's setting.	2002-01-06

There are a number of stories that concern a main character whose personal troubles give him illumination into the larger troubles of society.  This book is unusual in that:<br />-- the main character is a sour, depressed member of an old local aristocracy that has lost its power and prestige <br />-- in his opinion, the troubles with society are the lack of chivalrous values and a sense of mission.<br />The book takes on the pompous and self-pitying tone of its main character, and the points it makes about society seem so... well, conservative, even fuddy-duddy and irrelevant... that it makes you wonder if the author really means it or if he's trying to portray something.  If the author really does mean it, then I wish he had drawn a character I had a little sympathy for.  The personal problems just don't have must drama, and Lancelot Lamar himself is just not... that... exciting...	2001-12-26

The main character is named &quot;Chance,&quot; and that says it all: He's a semiretarded gardener who is fortunately graced with terrific grooming habits, a good set of fine clothes, and a careful pattern of speech.  He ends up--totally obliviously--as an advisor to the President of the United States and possibly the next candidate!  This book is not only intelligent--it's funny.  If only it weren't so darn plausible.<br />The movie made from this book (also called &quot;Being There&quot;) is as good as the book!  It stars Peter Sellers, who is phenomenal.<br />FYI Jerzy Kosinski, the author, also wrote &quot;The Painted Bird,&quot; a haunting and violent chronicle of the author's own experience as an accidentally abandoned child during World War Two.  It is also noteworthy for its fatalistic emphasis on chance and randomness, on the ultimate meaninglessness and precariousness of personal attachments and identity.	2001-12-26

I am amazed at how ingenious it is, at the originality of the scenes, of the language, of the episodic and deliberately choppy narrative (which seems like a stream of consciousness nonetheless). But I can't agree with those who see the book as any kind of \\"indictment\\" of American society.  I don't think it really knows what it is saying; the drugged-outness runs so deep that I can't make out an argument.  Not that that's bad.  Good literature doesn't need an argument to be good literature.   But if you take away this side of Naked Lunch, then you have to throw up your hands at the sections where it SOUNDS like some kind of condemnation and say, \\"Well... Whatever.\\"  I guess it's like a picaresque novel on barbiturates.<br />I don't see this as one of American literature's \\"must-reads,\\" except to help gain some sense of the Beat movement and of the kind of stuff that developed in reaction to 1950's pop culture.....	2001-12-25

There are now untold numbers of grad students and professors writing theoretical pieces about California as the place where American capitalist culture reaches its nastiest extremes.<br />There's something to this viewpoint, I guess, but the risk is that you forget that you're talking about actual people whose lives may or may not be exploited by the trends of &quot;mass culture&quot; that are mocked so heavily. <br />These essays by Joan Didion are in this tradition of hip detachment.  She treats Caifornia as a big testing ground for American culture, and has a bit of a knee-jerk tendency to make fun of normal middle-class people.  All the same, it could be worse, and her insights are very, very interesting (although her criticisms of hippie life are a bit obvious, aren't they?  even for when she wrote them?)...	2001-12-25

It raises the question of how a good man, surrounded by corruption and undermined by his own weakness, can find the moral righteous course of action.

This is all too realistic in academia, and is just hilarious to me.<br />A few other cool ideas are floating around in this book (toxic cloud)...  But for all that I tried, I just couldn't get myself to care about any of these characters.  They all seemed flat, almost statistical abstractions.  (The protagonist's wife seemed like a poll-driven sketch of a soccer mom.)  They seemed much more obsessive and fearful about life's petty poisons and rivalries than most people.

One scholar (Conor Cruise O'Brien) thinks it's really about Camus coming to terms with Algeria.  (Camus once said, in a famous response to Sartre, &quot;When asked to choose between justice and my mother, I choose my mother.&quot;  His mother lived in French Algeria.) Interestingly, &quot;The Fall&quot; is the only Camus novel set outside Africa-- in foggy Amsterdam, land of carnal lust and moral ambiguity!<br />Very well-crafted mood of unease, very intelligent broodings.  It does, however, seem contrived to specifically fit Camus' purpose of moral exploraion, and the characters seem awfully schematic.  This might make it a little too didactic for some readers.	2001-12-25

This book paints as no other book does the mood and feel of the pre-Civil War north.  What did it mean to be an abolitionist?  What kind of (white) people were willing to fight for that cause?<br />The portrayals of the American landscape are thrilling, too.  The way Banks describes the sun hitting the Adirondacks seems to come straight out of a Hudson River School painting.  Those descriptions alone are a reason to buy this book.  But the real draw is the austere, inexorable march -- well paced over the 1,000 pages -- to the novel's violent end.	2001-12-25
