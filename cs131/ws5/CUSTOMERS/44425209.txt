Of course, the encouragement, biblical principles and inspiration that Leslie gives is addressed to a spouse wanting to respond in a godly manner toward a spouse who isn't. And she does that so well that anyone facing that would know exactly how to respond. But if you're not facing that, you will also benefit from this excellent book. After all, don't we all have someone in our life who isn't acting the way we think he/she should? Instead of trying to control them, Leslie inspires us to respond in a godly manner through her practical ideas and encouraging insights. I highly recommend this book.	2001-10-22

It has a &quot;you can do it&quot; kind of attitude and makes you believe you can be a good mom. I especially liked the concept of &quot;marriage internships&quot; and how our growing-up family may not have been the best &quot;internship&quot; for marriage. Also, the chapter on grace was excellent. REally made it clear how to give grace to the people in your family. I highly recommend this book	2001-07-12
