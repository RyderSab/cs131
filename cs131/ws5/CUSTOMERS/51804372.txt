I know other reviews will give you more details about this, but I loved it and wanted to add my 5 stars. Lisa Kleypas seems to have gotten more fun-loving in later books. Anyone who likes Julia Quinn will like these newer books. (Even though all of her books are keepers.)	2005-10-08

I plopped down on top of this one and it felt pretty comfortable. Sure enough, my pet human stopped and gave me a great massage. She says the book explains why we cats can be aloof and disdainful. It has many \\"Dear Abby\\" type letters, classified ads, advice and definitions.<br /><br />One classified ad read, \\"If you're submissive, read on. Upbeat, Rubenesque Maine Coon seeks good home with endlessly giving, insecure owner who'll try to please me even when I'm having a hissy fit. The right owner will never assume he's doing too much for his pet, or experience moral outrage if I \\"get lucky\\" with a gopher. Let's have lunch and talk.\\"<br /><br />This book also offers a peek into a cat's mind and offers other advice that our humans ought to know.

Dark Lover will easily make the best seller lists and win awards. I love paranormal romances (as well as all other kinds of romances - having read hundreds of them) and this is top quality. At first, I was dismayed by the level of violence and cussing in this book, it being even grittier than Kenyon's and Feehan's works. Still, I think Sherrilyn Kenyon fans will love this. The romance was superb - not overboard on the sex but plenty of detailed sensuality - just perfect! We get to meet several lovable(ha!) characters which will make up future books in this series and I will read them all, even if I am flinching a bit at all the blood, gore and language. The romantic line is worth it.	2005-09-22

I've read all the Cynster novels by this author. The Truth About Love was better than several previous ones. It was a joy to see Patience and Vane make an appearance and to discover that Gerrard has become an excellent artist. The story was exciting -- lots of action near the end. I love the subtlety Laurens uses, she says so much with the raise of an eyebrow - also how Jacqueline overcomes the gossip and moves forward.

But I didn't because the writing was good, I wanted to know what happened next, and the story ended very well -- in fact, this ends the series of her 3 princess novels and draws everybody into its conclusion.

It would be best to read the first book, but of course, the story stands on its own, as well. She tells good stories with many interesting secondary characters in them. The only minor frustration I have is with these secondary characters. She started telling a love story with a set of characters in her first book, then continued their story in her second book. Their story did not conclude, though, and other secondary characters were introduced and left with unsolved problems so we expect more answers in a forthcoming third book. I am not happy with the length of time it takes to resolve our secondary characters' love lives. I wish they had happy endings, too.<br />Otherwise, the main characters are great, entertaining, sensual and fun to read. I recommend this book.	2003-08-21

If you liked the TV show Xeena, Warrior Princess, this book might appeal to you. The herione is a tough, well-trained knight of the future who travels back in time to complete missions for her boss (who looks like Yoda of Star Wars). She has supernatural abilities and slices enemies into pieces right and left with her special powers (she even has a light saber). It gets a bit gruesome. She meets her match many centuries back in time, though. While there is a lot of violence, this is a sensual romance. In fact, several secondary characters fall in love. I liked it.<br />This book has an element that I enjoy -- the story continues long after the couple has confessed love and married. I like to see a relationship deepen and continue. The plot keeps them plenty busy.<br />I hope she writes many more books.	2003-08-19

It's the 5th in a series. Read them all! They are set in the early 1800's and deal much with historical England and the invented island country of Akora. It's a wonderful mix of culture with lots of romance and adventure. I hope she writes many more.	2003-08-13

Read also Shadower and Shamara. There's a double romance here which makes it extra special. I liked the new little alien life discovered by Rurick and Celie although it didn't have much to do with the story -- it was just cute and did allow the main characters to make a point or two.<br />Rurick pretends to be an android as a security measure since he is really a crown prince. Celie is a smuggler with a good heart. Never boring -- never slow. It was great from start to finish and it was good to see older characters again.	2003-08-06

This is the 4th in what I think might be a series of 5 books. The first book, One Man's Love, covers the parents of the characters in the other books. I love all the books in this series. Karen Ranney writes so deeply and moving. She has a style like no other. Its almost hypnotic and I almost always cry, even though the books are beautiful. One things I like most is that the story continues long after the couple have acknowledged a love for each other. We get to see their families from previous stories and share in their happiness for a good while before the book ends -- such a nice thing.<br />Two of her other books are among my very favorites, My Beloved and After the Kiss.	2003-08-06

This is a keeper (one of those rare books that I keep forever instead of give away when I'm done). I don't have much space, so a book really has to be special to keep. This is a sequel to Heart Mate released last year. Ruis and Ailim live in a fictional world where almost every one has magical powers. They've lost the art of science (which is Ruis's specialty since he is one of those very rare people who has no powers. In fact, he is a Null meaning other magic can not work in his presence). Ailim can read emotions and gets great relief in Ruis's presence. I can't begin to describe all of the ways I love this book, but I especially enjoy the science fiction and magical aspect in the amazing world Robin creates.<br />It was enjoyable to see again the characters from Heart Mate and see how they were doing as they blended into this story. Keep writing, Robin! You are one of the best and deserve the awards you've won.	2003-07-26

I hope Christine Feehen DOES do a series along this line. She covered the first of 7 sisters. Eileen Wilks has a FANTASTIC premise for her werewolves. I PRAY she will take this world and do a series of books. Feehan fans will love her.<br />The only story I didn't like was the second one. As the review said, it was only a prologue - nothing was resolved.	2003-07-14

I would prefer there be about half as many such scenes (which stills leaves a LOT), more sparkling conversation and other action as with the earlier Cynster books. Stephanie Laurens is a genius with conversation and social situations in historical England. Maybe an editor told her that more sex sells more books, but too much of it takes away from the story and it is getting to be too much.	2003-02-27

I enjoy the supernatural in books and love was a good theme, but \\"love conquers all\\" was a bit overdone and I began to get sick of how the theme was constantly drummed into the reader -- we really don't need to be told 20-kazillion times. By the end of the book, I was sick of the lectures on love -- but I am glad I read this anyway -- a real feel good book and it looks like another sequel might be coming with Sydney. :)	2003-02-26

James is so good-looking that he is irresistible to others, but he hardly notices the other women except for Riona.

I also loved After the Kiss (not in this series) but just as satisying to read.	2002-04-23

Her heroes are wonderful, thrilling and not stupid. She has the subtleties just right -- with a glance, a character conveys volumes.<br />The story of Amanda and Martin was hard to put down. I have read all of her novels to date and the Cynster series is a joy. I can't wait to read Amelia's story and more to come!!	2002-04-11

Her writing is certainly good enough to deserve it.<br />She knows how to please readers, going just far enough with her characters but not too far. I hate characters that are drenched with misunderstanding and deep sorrowful events.<br />This book had an exciting plot and suspense but was not overly depressing -- the Christmas background was perfect.	2002-01-09

I love the dialogue she writes and the funny characters she creates (in the twins here), but this book also had a very sad plot line. Much bad befalls the two main characters -- more than someone would like to see in a romance novel. I was depressed through the first 2/3 of the book for the unthinkable things that happened. It picks up after that, though. I have read most of Kurland's books and this is my least favorite. Still, I highly recommend her other books such as Stardust of Yesterday and Dance Through Time.	2001-11-08

While the plot may have a few illogical turns, the book was a good read and fun. I recommend it. I cried at the end for the beauty of the story (and not many books can do this to me).
