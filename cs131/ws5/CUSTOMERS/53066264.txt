Set in Los Angeles and Central Asia, it's a deeply funny and satiric take on U.S. TV programming, Hollywood producers, the CIA and others. Much out-loud laughter during reading. Finest kind.

I was astounded, and so gratified I could barely stand it.  This novel addresses intimate parts of the human experience and does it with grace, wisdom and controlled eloquence. <br /> <br />The geographic reach of the story adds to its appeal, from New England to New Orleans, secrets and love are held close but held fast.  There's so much in this novel to satisfy -- a rare blend of exquisite story and just-restrained language.  This novel is truly finest kind.	2005-09-01

It's sharply written, the topic itself is no slouch and there's lots of fascinating science and history. The locale is the Farralon Islands, 23 miles off the coast of San Francisco but thousands of years away from civilization; a nightmare world of monolithic stones in the ocean, violent weather, notorious currents and a mecca for naturalists of all kinds. Birds are big here, as are great whites, bats, various seals including Stellers, Elephant and the ordinary cutty pies; plus urchins, whales -- blue, grey, humpback, etc.  <br /> <br />Terrific book with loads of detail, some of it squiffy: e.g.,  <br /> <br /> <br />\\"One little known fact: The water that spouts out of a whale's blowhole in such a picturesque way reeks like the most toxic fart imaginble.\\"  <br /> <br />...  <br /> <br />\\"Wouldn't it be ideal, I'd thought, for those nights when I opted to sleep under ths stars ...? But that was before I [knew] about the kelp flies.  <br /> <br />\\"They were at theit peak now, a carpeting plague, crawling up pant legs and down shirt fronts, overwhelming a person's every moment outside. And these flies were not the cleanest insecfts -- their preferred habitat is the inside of a seal's anus.\\"  <br /> <br />It turns out that sharks are ancient. I knew that but I didn't know they are more ancient than trees!  <br /> <br />Marvelous book with one great drawback: it lacks an index. When will writers, editors and publishers wise up.	2005-07-25

In this novel, she satirizes all of us with a deft pen and a fair amount of compassion.  Prose knows people, in the end, are capable of change but those around them will do them damndest to retard same.   <br /> <br />So, all the above is cool, but the book is mighty tasty reading, too.

Forget the \\"true\\" story of the Bounty, it's all the other bits and pieces that are so fascinating. For example, what was the big deal with the breadfruit trees after all? If Bligh wasn't all bad (and he wasn't at all, quite the countrary), why did he slip into ill repute? Who killed Fletcher Christian or did he slip secretly back to England? Was it all the fault of Joseph Banks? Were the Tahitians transported to Pitcairn tormented by protestantism? And more, so much more. Fabulous book. Great gift book.

US	53066264	R2UI6HD50FOGOY	0670033359	800694065	March: A Novel	Books	4	6	7	N	Y	Readable novel of a Callow Connectican	This novel takes up the story of Father March (that would be Marmee's husband and the daddy of Alcott's Little Women), his early adulthood as a traveling peddlar throughout the South as well as his time in the Civil War away from his tender, civilized family in Conneticut. There's quite a lot of gorgeous \\"you-are-there\\" writing and the ornate tones of the time. There's also graphic, effective and important description of the horror of the War Between the States. War and horror here is the backdrop for something more insidious.  <br /> <br />I quite liked this novel but I'm not at all sure others will cotton to it for the same reasons I did. March is a weak bit of flesh and spirit in more ways than one can count. He thinks he falls in love with a black slave but does no more than kiss her; in a complicated environment, March goes about his business whilst the slave woman is marked by punishment. Later, March gives away much of his wealth to the movement backing John Brown; when Brown strikes and kills, March is distraught.  It turns out March backed Brown more to gain Marmee's approval than for his own beliefs. This poor man just doesn't know which way he's coming or going. He gets another chance to betray the slave woman of his youth ... and he does. This man has neither the courage of his half-wrought convictions nor the strength of passion. The hero in this novel isn't March; she's Grace. And, maybe, Marmee in a distant second.  <br /> <br />I've no idea what Brooks intended but what I read in her novel is a powerful story of a half-formed man tossed here and there by the currents of his time and history. March is fragile carrier of the tale, not a particularly admirable fellow, much less than that, in fact. A callow and weak offspring of privilege who stumbles ineffectively throughout the portions of his life we are shown in this novel.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, since Brook's very readable first novel, \\"Year of Wonder\\" is notable hugely for its revisionism as wellas the inappropriate ending which threw most readers for a loop or two, I must say she handles the language and general culture better in \\"March\\" but the revisionism rears its head often enough to become familiar. March wouldn't have been such a lost, toothless soul had he not been made by his creator to conform to our contemporary ideals.  <br />	2005-04-22

It's also scary as all hell in that it starts with a bang with the death of a husband and parent. This is so well rendered by Miller that I had hairs standing up on my arms and the most lothesome sense of dread anchoring my arms and legs into immobility. I don't think I could have moved at the time I read that part of the book.  <br /> <br />The novel is set in wine-infested Napa of the 80's. The lives lived against that backdrop tear apart the characters ... and the reader. There is perfection in this novel and it fairly shines; the stories are exquisite, important. In the end, though, Miller lets the stories fall away from a central gravity into a shattered kind of foretelling. Sadly, this novel falls apart at the end.  <br />	2005-04-22

Yet, it is chock full of flawed characters the reader comes to regard affectionately or appreciatively and there's only one particularly fecklessly evil player (and even she isn't so much evil as disgustingly selfish). All set in a mid-western town so well drawn. LOVED this book! It's a debut; can't wait to see what King does next. Heh, no pressure, buddy. But, hurry up please, Dave King.

Starts quiet and sort of stays that way which belies the strength of its voice and story which rings loud and clear -- the power, trauma, guilt and loss as each are worked upon. The tiny Maritian island in this book is a stripped down, bare essentials cosmos. Some will say it's a love story but it's no more nor less than a survival story, and that's beautifully sufficient and gorgeously written (though not over-written). Will be moving on, just as quickly as my feet can scurry to my local, to Anderson's earlier novel Hidden Latitudes. She seems to have a thing for Island novels; works for me!	2005-02-08

Wonderful novel	Exceptionally engaging novel set in Cornwall in 1917 as WWI has less than a year to go but still was horrifying times for the U.K. with no sense of the \\"victory\\" to come. A group of artists and writers including the not wildly-popular D.H. Lawrence and Freida, his German-born wife, occupy the center of this tale. Our narrator is Clare who, in her intelligent naivete tells us quite a lot. Rich and special.

This one is set in apartheid South Africa with themes of loyalty, obsession, predatory sexuality and abuse as well as sister kinship.

It will be utterly fascinating to see where the almighty critics and pundits line up on this one.  As used as we are to O'Hanlon's oddities, this book will try most of us ... and with good result and more.  <br /> <br />This isn't a \\"No Mercy\\" book from O'Hanlan's pen; it's something else entirely, totally different.  In fact, maybe, there's too much mercy -- depends upond how one feels about male bonding.  Neverless, I've rarely read a more rivetting tome, really -- I'm talking finest kind here.  It's just ... well, I don't know what to think of it yet. <br /> <br />It's not like anything I ever read before ... and, fron O'Hanlon, that has to be a good thing -- but difficult to describe.

But, it's an arduous plod in the first 150 pages before the plot eventually snares the reader. Lots of fascinating 1890's NYC detail which is why I stayed with the novel up to the too-postponed end. Especially as the putative mystery thriller it is touted as, this book has many plot problems.  In a mystery, the plot doesn't have to be realistic but it does have to be convincing and this one is not.

Ackroyd borrows both form and characters but puts them to different tasks. Who knew (I guess I should have) that the Puritan concept (also Presbyterian) of predestination actually had its roots in an intense debate within The Church in the 13th and 14th centuries. Wonderfully written and enjoyable. E.g., Part of the secret tunnels that connected the Clerkenwell cloister to the priory of St. John of Jerusalem now can be seen in the basement of the Marx Memorial Library at 37a Clerkenwell Green, London.

If you liked Kent Haruf's \\"Plainsong,\\" then you are certain to be mesmerized by Sharratt's \\"The Real Minerva.\\" And, if you hated the Haruf, you still should read the Sharratt.  <br /> <br />Life in small-town in Minnesota was, of course, surfeit with gossip, hidden drama and repressed sensibilities.  Sharratt's novel captures all of this but rather more in their grandure than their conventional tawdriness.  Minerva is the most alive small town I know -- fictional or otherwise.  The protagonists in this book will win your heart but not through cheap sentiment. <br />	2004-08-28

It's a big book, too (672 luscious pages), dealing with England's Beau Monde at the end of the 18th century just at the time of the French Revolution which, in fact, plays a significant role in the book as do Whig/Tory politics (including Sheridan), the English art world, sculpture, theatre (including Sheridan), fashion and, as always, sexual politics and love.

Young woman aspiring artist with many privileges goes to pot in glamorously hip NYC in the semi-aftermath of her mother's death. The protagonist's voice is clear and unique (in my experience), the dialogue is excellent. The book's representation of hedonist, druggy, downtown restaurant/club life in Manhattan is somewhat picturesque but I can't see why anyone would WANT to write this story.

Just finished John Searles' \\"Strange But True\\" which is part mystery, part teen-age romance turned tragic, part marriage mistakes and family politics, part rite of passage, part thriller, part tragey and wrecked people, part redemption and utterly fine reading not to mention all wonderful.  <br /> <br />Searles' earlier novel, his first, \\"Boy Still Missing,\\" is a good read but this, his second, novel is entirely engrossing and that rare combination of writing + story + plot = finest kind. This book makes a great gift for just about everyone you know except, perhaps, Lutheran ministers.  <br /> <br />One complaint only; OK, it's not really a complaint but a reality moment: the book is a bit stern (and was meant to be), although that comes naturally with the story, the telling and the language. It's not a heavy/drowning book but it is a book that examines cause and effect with a strict minuteness that is superb. Meanwhile, thank goodness for the remarkable Donnelly Fiume and his variously scaled menagerie in East Village -- they lighten and enhance the reader's load.  <br /> <br />Addendum: poets and poetry lovers may find a special affinity for this novel.

This is an exciting spy novel set in the Soviet Union whilst Gorbachev is coming to power (with a putsch in store). It grabs the reader on page one and doesn't let go until the end yet most readers won't want the story to end. But it does of course, and, in a way that is most unusual for spy novels.  <br /> <br />There is an insouciant voice in this book that is both entertaining and amusingly annoying. Hillhouse has done a good job in crafting her hero and ensuring she's interesting. Probably best is why said hero, Faith, hates her mother who is an evangelical christian who has been smuggling bibles and other christian lit into the Soviet Union for decades. Early on, when faith was only 5, she watched her mother butcher her beloved teddy bear with a long knife to retrived a hidden bible. And ... fron there. Quite delightful.  <br /> <br />From the get-go, it's clear this isn't a traditional espionage tome -- it's not Eric Ambler or Jean le Carre or Len Deighton. Our hero is a semi-amateur black-market smuggler who succeeds in defeating the professional yet rigid Soviets (KBP AND GPU) and Stasi (the East German secret intelligence), etc.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, it's a terrific read and there's lots of fascinating detail. Give yourself 30+ pages to settle in, then you'll have a good time, I guarantee.  <br />	2004-08-19

This is the third Buchan novel I've read so it's time to confess I'm a fan, and I'm not just waving air. This is a particular kind of wit that was inspired earlier by Fay Weldon and Buchan has done more with it. Buchan's novels are irresistable and mighty tasty reads. There's wit aplenty and intelligence as well as a worldview of interest. This one, &quot;The Good Wife&quot; has to do with a loyal MP's wife who, 20 years down the marriage pike, has to reassess her existence, her life, her marriage. It's quite good indeed.  <br />  <br /> The other two Buchan books I enjoyed are: Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman and Perfect Love, this latter could have been somewhat shorter (editors note same). Buchan writes entirely fine novels but I dislike her titles which probably help her to sell well so I should shut up. I think the titles diminish the literary quality of the novels which is high.	2004-08-07

I read it in a single sitting, stuck to the chair, didn't move until I'd finished the book.  <br /> <br />I never know what to say about Hoffman because there's so much around her writing that I tend to sniff at, to abjure. But, as with others of her best books, she drew me in with this one and I cannot do more than writhe with a certain contenment, with satisfaction, with a sense of history embedded deeply by Hoffman. I think she does that, like a tick sort of, with most of her readers.	2004-08-05

I liked this novel quite a lot but thought the writer lost his track about midway through and the novel could easily have lost 50 pages with good editing.

And, we're off from there! Lots of wild animals, trekking, adventures, ship lore and more. Yeah, I had fun with this. The sort of book that many fathers and brothers would enjoy. Some moms, too.	2004-08-04

It's a short book but packed with fascination. For example, I'm not intense about quilts nor fabrics but found both to be fascinating and of intellectual quality as well. Not the mention the theory and practice of biography.  There's much in this mystery to tickle, provoke and appreciate.	2004-08-04

I no longer recall how I was alerted to this marvelous, especially suberb novel for bibliophiles. No matter, it's finest kind of reading, I assure you. It's not perfect but you won't care once you settle down with it. The first chapter is titled &quot;The Book Cemetery&quot; -- just wait 'til you read about this place. It's where I want to work and die!<br /><br /> In many ways this novel is an exceptionally Spanish mystery/thriller; there's philosophy, religion, intense passion, historical roots, mysticism and more. Barcelona comes alive in full color for the reader while the implications of the Spanish Civil War and its Francoist aftermath is presented clearly. Utterly splendid reading book.	2004-08-04

Set mostly in Broward and also Dade counties in and around Miami, the semi-tropical urban setting is well rendered and the cop detail fascinating. A beaut of a read.  <br /> <br />	2004-08-03

I enjoyed Goodman's first two academic gothic mysteries quite a lot but this one never even achieves sufficient spark to fizzle out. The book never clicks, there's nothing for the reader to go for. Well, there is one thing and I thought it finest kind -- the underwater sculpture garden. That could have been so cool ... but, in the end, wasn't enough. <br />	2004-08-01

This is a poor excuse for a novel but there's enough that appeals that I read it through to the inconclusive end (which was irritating). Stay-at-home dad and environmental lobbyist in D.C. and his cohorts expose the contradictory functioning of the National Science Foundation and the worse functioning, or lack thereof, of the U.S. political machine on Global Warming. Highly polemical but that's not its problem; writer didn't have a plot or story in mind so much as an expose. Best bits in the book are the visiting buddhists (who just might be poaching a new Pachen Lama) and the dad's relationship with his almost two-year old son. Polemical novels don't have to be this weak. You can have a point without ... being ineffective. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-01

I quite liked it. A terrific summer read, any other time of the year works out pertty good, too.  Entertaining and diverting; made me want to visit that part of the Virginia/Maryland coast.	2004-07-29

This gorgeously, generously written memoir by the novelist, Carolyn Slaughter, is certain to be on my list of Best Books at year's end. These are Slaughter's young years from birth in India to age 14. She moved with her parents from India to England to Africa where she spent most of her childhood, or what should have been her childhood. A brilliant, affecting, important book. Slaughter has been one of my favorite writers since I read her Africa novels (highly recommended!) years ago: Dreams of the Kalahari and The Innocents.	2004-07-26
US	53066264	R39Z6YJIN1KAE	0375411461	736224854	Osprey Island	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Deeply satisfying, luscious read	A perfect novel for summer, Nissen sets the story on a New Jersey island of few inhabitants until summer when vacationers come in droves to the Lodge which has seen better days. The housekeepers are young women from Ireland and the waiters and other service workers are college kids, mostly young men. The maintenance manager and head housekeeper are drunks married to one another and their young son, Squee, is the crux of the story together with the Lodge itself. There are several romances to track, one which will break your heart; and there buried secrets and tragedies as well as insights about outsiders, relationships and mutable truths. Birders, in particular, will be attracted to the book which imparts many interesting tidbits about osprey including their close encounter with extinction and return to unendangered status. I loved this book; read it straight through couldn't put it down.	2004-07-26

I didn't grow up in a godforsaken war zone as Fuller did in Africa but I was neck-deep and more in the colonial environment of Panama. This book cut me to the quick. Even without my background, however, the book is a special compilation of pages that very much need to be read. It's an unusual and amazing book; a reminder of how humanity stretches and can be brought to the edge of redemption before it knows it's not quite human any more. This book will be on my end-of-year Best Books list, no question. Even though I still am flumoxed by its contents.  Which, I think was the writer's point.  In which case, she done just fine.	2004-07-20

Terrific mystery, expecially for art lovers. Wilson gets not only into his characters just right but he builds his locale into service as well.  For anyone who has despaired for sophisticated mystery, Wilson has come to our rescue.  As with any Wilson book, there's welcome commentary on the regional cuisine and drink.	2004-07-20

If you thought good spy fiction was dead, think again; Robert Wilson has come to our rescue and he is finest kind. This novel spans 1942 to 1993; Berlin to London to Lisbon to Berlin to London and more. The best espionage novel I've read in ages. Smart and exceptionally well written/bitten but not without the occasional verbal over-reach.  Wilson brings to life the convoluted history of Britain's intelligence operations during WWII and how those merged with the MI5 and MI6 that we know from Le Carre in their counter Soviet efforts.  Mighty fine book; superb read.  Most satisfiying.	2004-07-20

Superb noir novel, then (Nazi Germany) and now (the present in Portugal). The first 30 or so pages are a jumble but it sorts out after that to be a terrific read. Really. Ok, ok, finest kind, of the could-not-put-down category. Can't wait to read more from Wilson.	2004-07-20

My fave bit occurs when the prosecuting attorney, after having been accused by defendent's attorney of trying to silence her, yells in response: \\"... the National Guard couldn't silence her.\\" The resolution was not unexpected so much as unrealisted.	2004-07-20

Mega superb, blast off your socks! <br />Rumor has it the book was originally written as a memoir; wow, that really knocks off socks!  Memoir, novel, whatever, it's finest kind of reading bar none. I am talking the kind of reading that holds you glued to the chair and your fingers flipping pages. There's such a conflagration of action and compassion in this book, the reader doesn't know where to turn, except for MORE of the book. <br />Horse lovers will love this book, as will farm lovers; historians will have a veritable ball; students of political science will be enthralled; religious enthusiasts will have grist; as will cooks who love to cook and can; weavers and seamtresses who adore their art; orchard (especially apple) aficionados will be thrilled. I swear, everything in this book is up someone's/everyone's alley at least thrice or more. Finest kind, indeed.	2004-06-30

It's definitely in the do-not-miss category and is very close to being best book of the year (so far). <br />Sometimes a novel can be too heavily loaded with detail but, in this one, the superb writing and language balance perfectly the detail. The book evokes its time (1789-1820 or so) richly and satisfyingly with a story that is more than a match for the times and the writing. To my eye, there's only one misstep and, likely, others wouldn't find it so.	2004-06-25

This one focusses on Fleur Pillager and it's sly, witty and graceful as well as a bit of a thriller.  I wonder about that surname, Pillager.  Fluer isn't particularly easy to like and don't think Erdrich meant her to be -- which makes her AND the novel all the more interesting.  Interesting trivia bit:  it's shorter than usual for Erdrich; I haven't decided yet if that's good or not.  Fortunately I don't have to as there will be another along soon, thank goodness.	2004-06-25

An entertaining read, indeed.	2004-06-24

This one, however, is mighty fine reading and particularly involving. Definitely THE story for those interested in adoption from whichever view you want (adoptee, adopter, married to, sibling with, etc.). <br />Wonderful book replete with the details, texture and ungovernable emotions of family life.  Finest kind of reading.  I have to say I learn from Trollope's novels and I mean that in a good way.  When it comes to the family and our human hearts, Trollope has insights that entertain, sure, but which also are useful.  Mind you, I hate that touch-feely stuff! but I love Trollope's novels.	2004-06-11

It's partly about the attraction of family when one has none and partly about the seduction of belonging.  And, about the ultimate belonging, the ultimate seduction:  motherhood.	2004-05-07

Another entry in the &quot;no characters to like&quot; mode but I loved the book enormously.  The Anglo-Welsh in decline, it's mordant, bitter, hysterically funny, wonderfully insightful and a bit of a thriller.	2004-05-03

There's a mystery here, too, but mostly the story is Maisie's and she's terrific.<br />The prose is redolent of its place and time and, even though Maisie may be a revisionist, she's most refreshingly wonderful if too pure and serious.  Can't wait for the next Maisie mystery.	2004-04-26

And, oddly or perhaps not, that useful in thinking about examined lives and such.  Of course, Hynes, can write bloody well ... or bloody well write, whichever, but lordy knows he gives awfully good book and then some.  This one, &quot;Kings of Infinite Space,&quot; is finest kind and a worthy counterpart to his earlier &quot;The Lecturer's Tale&quot; which also made sore my laugh muscles.<br />Folk who have read Hynes' earlier novela trilogy (&quot;Publish or Perish&quot;) might recognize a character or two, not all entirely human.  Hynes reprises these and gives them a fullness of life that anyone would envy.<br />If this guy ever writes a sententiously serious novel, he'd be in great danger of earning one of those prestigious prizes -- you know, a Pulitzer or an NBCC or some such.  Because everyone knows you can't write a marvelously FUNNY brilliant book and win squat.  Or rather, squat is what such a brilliant book wins.	2004-04-16

But &quot;Sweetwater&quot; isn't only about starting over but locating self in the world such that both benefit, or, at least, hope to.  <br />This is a quiet book in the midst of which a fire rages literally.  Yet it's the fires raging below the surface that captures the reader's attention and holds it perfectly to the end which is imperfect but that's not Robinson's fault since she merely reflects the imperfect world in which we live.  Yet, that ending, aspires, at least, to perfection.<br />I loved this novel, finest kind.<br />And, if you're one who revels in nature, the refection of it in this book is a special treat.	2004-04-16

Actually, I'm surprized Weber's book isn't getting more attention for its post-modern, writerly-conscious antics.  At first I thought I'd hate those shennanigans but, truth to tell, they grew on me and I came to thoroughly enjoy this bifurcated, multi-conscious, novel.<br />That po-mo stuff aside, this is a fluidly readable novel that pulls in the reader with tenaciously fascinating hooks.

A young under-grad poet-in-training from Long Island lucks into a fellowship in Manhattan with a highly respected poet and, dear reader, this is their story. Wow and wow. <br />A must-read for anyone who has an interest in good novels, poetry, luscious language, insightful stories amusingly told, Manhattan, the academic milieu. My only regret on reading this book is having read it since it won't ever again be unknown ground to me.
