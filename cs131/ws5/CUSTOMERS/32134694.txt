(...) Kalu Rinpoche explained the importance of this work as follows: \\"(...) If this great work is translated into English, the nature of all samsara and nirvana will appear as vividly as a reflection in a clear mirror in the minds of the most learned people of the world, as though the expanse of their understanding were illuminated with sunlight.\\"<br /><br />\\"Myriad Worlds\\" discusses Buddhist cosmography and the genesis of beings who inhabit the universe.<br /><br />Kongtrul delineates four levels of cosmology:<br /><br />1. The numerically definite cosmology of the Individual Way (hinayana), in which the collective force of the evolutionary actions of sentient beings creates the world, and therefore all beings contribute to the creation of the world;<br /><br />2. The cosmology of infinity buddha-fields of the Universal Way (mahayana), in which infinite world-systems come into being as phantom appearances, through bodhisattvas purifying buddha-fields, in which they may fulfill their heroic vows to liberate all beings. The universe is conceived as a cycle without commencement that repeats itself until all beings are liberated from the sufferings of cyclic existence;<br /><br />3. The cosmology of the Tantra of the Wheel of Time (Kalacakra), which establishes a correspondence between the macrocosm and microcosm in terms of the formation of the universe and fetal development, and between the configuration of the universe and the shape and size of the human body;<br /><br />4. The noncosmology of the Dzog-chen (Great Perfection) system, drawing extensively from Longchenpa, in which the primal creative cause of the universe is neither the evolutionary actions of beings nor the interrelationships of the compassion of the buddhas and sentient beings, but rigpa, a state of pure and total awareness, which is nothing other than the primordially pure ground of being itself. Failure to recognize the primordially pure nature of the ground of being is unawareness, which itself arises from intrinsic awareness. The primordial freedom that one seeks to attain by practicing the spiritual path is something that one already possesses. Intrinsic freedom is itself the path that leads to the actualization of the goal.<br /><br />From the translator's introduction: \\"Myriad Worlds contains invaluable material for study, reflection, and the refinement of one's mind.

Chronicles say that he crossed the Nepal-Tibet border in 1091. Having remained ten years in Tibet, he traveled for twelve years in China, and returned to the Land of Snow until his death. Before passing away at Tingri in 1117, as a last teaching, he gave these Hundred Verses of Spiritual Advice to the People of Tingri. Soon after, he said\\" \\"My mind has blended with the phenomenal world,\\" thus showing that all dual perceptions had disappeared from his mind. He then fixed his gaze on the sky and passed away.<br /><br />\\"Each of these verses is generously commented by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche (1910-1991) in a most lucid and direct way, showing that the \\"people of Tingri\\" are none other than all seekers of truth. With great love, but without any concession, Khyentse Rinpoche gives us a magnificent teaching on how to turn our thoughts to what truly matters in life, practice with our whole being, and discover the ultimate nature of mind.\\"<br /><br />\\"As parents, all beings in these six realms have<br />cared for you;<br />People of Tingri, don't relate to them with<br />your ideas of \\"I\\" and \\"mine\\".\\"<br /><br />I cherish this book as the sincere parting advice of a \\"dear friend\\", now deceased.

Or refer to the respective chapter in \\"Mystical Dimensions of Islam\\" by Annemarie Schimmel (ISBN 0807812714).<br /><br />During his lifetime, there was already a controversy between Hallaj and the so-called \\"Baghdad School of Sufism\\", whose leader and initial master of Hallaj, Junayd of Baghdad, was very critical about Hallaj's behavior. This controversy centered around the principle view whether \\"sobriety-after-intoxication\\" (sahw) was higher than \\"mystical intoxication\\" (sokr), or just the opposite. While Hallaj believed that \\"love as long as it is hidden, is in danger\\", Junayd considered that a person who is searching for Reality must be in a state of mental equilibrium, and that intoxication is the playground of children, while sobriety is the annihilation-ground of men.<br /><br />The \\"Kitab at-tawasin\\", whose translation we have here, contains a number of chapters, each of them called \\"tasin\\", after the mysterious letters at the beginning of the Koranic Sura 27, which are said to indicate divine majesty and power. This little book deals with problems of divine unity (tawhid) and with prophetology. It contains a discussion between God and Satan, in which the latter refuses to obey the divine order to prostrate himself before Adam, and, as a true muwahhid (\\"confessor of divine unity\\") is caught in the dilemma between God's eternal will that nobody should worship any being save Him and His explicit order to fall down before a created being. Hallaj's \\"satanology\\" inspired a number of later mystics to develop these ideas.<br /><br />I also like the fierce language in the Introduction to this English translation of the Tawasin, in which the translator rages against \\"popular personality-cult merchants\\", \\"non-Muslim pseudo-sufis\\" and \\"orientalists\\", amongst whom \\"Frithjof Schuon, the French esotericist Rene Guenon, and Titus Burkhardt the Guenonian.\\"<br /><br />The Tawasin is very difficult to understand or to make sense of. From the Introduction: \\"In presenting the \\"Tawasin\\" of al-Hallaj, may Allah be merciful to him and all the awliya [\\"saints\\"] whom we have mentioned, we have deliberately refrained from any explanation. Frankly, despite the glib transliterative clarity of the orientalists, we cannot hope to understand the greater part of the \\"Tawasin\\".\\"<br /><br />And that's how it is.er of later mystics to develop these ideas.

The latter's seminal achievement was to put the faith of Islam in a time of crisis on a firm theological footing (a work comparable to that of Thomas Aquinas with respect to Western Christianity). Another accomplishment of Abu Hamid was to bring Sufism into the fold of mainstream Islam.<br /><br />Ahmad Ghazzali was a giant among spiritual men and a master of masters, the teacher of Divine Love par excellence, and the first to undertake the task of writing explicitly (though rather unsystematically) about the metaphysics of Love.<br />His most famous disciple was `Ayn al-Qudat Hamadani (1098-1132), a spiritual prodigy of rare genius. Their spiritual relationship is, after that of Rumi and Shams Tabrizi, perhaps the best-known in Sufi history.<br />Where Ahmad brought innovations into the Sufi doctrine of love as well as the Sufi view of Iblis (Satan) as the \\"highest devotee\\", `Ayn al-Qudat carried his master's ideas so far that he was brutally martyred at age 33 for expounding them.<br /><br />\\"Sawanih\\" is the longest and the most important book that Ahmad wrote in Persian. According to his teachings, when a mystic goes beyond the phenomenal world, he passes through three different plains: the Heart (dil), the Spirit (ruh), and the Subtle or Secret (sirr). The world of the spirit is thus the intermediate ontological plain, and it is the proper domain of love. It is on this plain that the mystic becomes a lover. The ideas or notions that the mystic experiences while passing through this plain is called, \\"sawanih\\".<br />In later generations, the school of Ahmad Ghazzali kept its influence almost exclusively in poetry. The world-famous odes of Hafiz of Shiraz are in fact its most exquisite and sublime expressions.<br /><br />If you like \\"Divine Flashes (Lama'at)\\" by Fakhruddin `Eraqi (ISBN 0281038678), then you will also like these \\"Sawanih\\" by Ahmad Ghazzali, although Eraqi's \\"Divine Flashes\\" are much more accessible and systematic.<br /><br />\\"In the sorrow of love, we condole ourselves.<br />We are distracted and bewildered by our own work,<br />Bankrupted by our own fortune,<br />Ourselves the hunters, ourselves the game.\\"<br />- Ahmad Ghazzalihes\\" are much more accessible and systematic.    \\"In the sorrow of love, we condole ourselves.  We are distracted and bewildered by our own work,  Bankrupted by our own fortune,  Ourselves the hunters, ourselves the game.\\"  - Ahmad Ghazzali	2004-11-23

The book contains profound instructions for developing clarity within the sleep and dream states.<br /><br />The relevance of these teachings is that they allow us to practice even while sleeping and dreaming, because these states make up almost one-third of our lives. Moreover, it is said that if a person applies a practice within a dream, the practice is nine times more effective than when it is applied during the waking hours. Dream practice is very important for liberating us from habits.<br /><br />\\"When the state of dreaming has dawned,<br />do not lie in ignorance like a corpse.<br />Enter the natural sphere of unwavering attentiveness.<br />Recognize your dreams and transform illusion into luminosity.<br />Do not sleep like an animal.<br />Do the practice which mixes sleep and reality.\\"	2004-11-22

If you are new to these bardo teachings, then this is probably not the best book to start. However, it is very useful for further reading, particularly on the human psychology of the bardo experiences.<br /><br />In his book, Trungpa Rinpoche describes what is traditionally known in Tibetan Buddhism as the \\"six realms\\", or worlds that we create as the projections of such powerful energies as anger, greed, ignorance, lust, envy, and pride. Having disowned the power of our emotions and projected that power onto the world outside, we find ourselves trapped in a variety of ways and see no hope of escape.<br /><br />But it is within these projected realms, that the bardo experience arises as the heightened experience of that realm.<br />Now this heightened experience may go either way: Either we become (further) stuck in complete confusion of entrapment, or we open up to the possibility of sudden transformation of solidity into freedom - thus utilizing the bardo as a turning-point to freedom.<br /><br />Bardo is explained as a ambiguous peak experience of \\"being in-between\\", \\"being in no-man's-land\\", neither belonging \\"here\\" nor \\"there\\". It belongs to situations in which we have emerged from the past and have not yet formulated the future, but strangely enough, we happen to be \\"somewhere\\".<br />It is at once \\"as if\\" being completely confused (to the point of being on the verge of madness) \\"and yet\\" being on the verge of awakening by resolving the confusion. You are not quite certain whether you have completely gone mad or you are \\"just about\\" to receive something. It is at once sanity/insanity.<br />This happens because even within the most solidified and seemingly hopeless accomplishment of ego's domain, the possibility of awakening is ever-present.<br /><br />Bardo experience could be a breakthrough, but at the same time it is not a \\"big deal\\" (as ego would like to have it). Bardo understanding brings us into the very earth-grounding quality that nothing is changed before bardo experience, and nothing is changed after bardo experience - the experience is simply gone through. Bardo experiences, whether highlights or ordinary situations, are not \\"transformations\\" of your life; they are continuity.<br /><br />Nevertheless, bardo experiences do provide turning-points in our awareness, if we would only know how to handle the experience. The book provides lively presentations, in which the author tries to convey to the reader - in his characteristic style - the sense of how the various bardos are actually experienced, and resolved:<br /><br />projected realm -- ambiguous (confused) bardo experience -- potential bardo solution:<br /><br />god realm  - immobile eternity of \\"fearful hope/hopeful fear\\"  -- \\"clear-light\\"<br />jealous gods' realm  - speedy paranoia of \\"going too far/getting somewhere\\" -- \\"giving birth\\"<br />human realm  - tricky deception of \\"reality /hallucination\\" -- \\"illusory body\\"<br />animal realm  - stupid dependency of \\"holding on/giving in\\" -- \\"dream\\"<br />hungry ghoast realm - craving despair of \\"wanting to get/keep on wanting  -- \\"becoming\\"<br />hell realm  - mad terror of \\"destructive creativity/creative destruction\\" -- \\"death\\"<br /><br />I made the above table from my notes from the book, but it shows only a few aspects. The following descriptions are pieced together from the book, for the purpose of this review:<br /><br />The bardo of birth in the jealous gods' realm is like a woman trying to give birth and keep the baby at the same time. You put out a certain amount of speed constantly, constantly comparing with others, yet you are not quite certain whether you are getting anything out of it or whether you are losing something. It is as if you are going too far. Trying to attain something higher and greater constantly, it may lead to a peak state of extreme paranoia that if you watch for every pitfall, then you will be saved. In the bardo experience of this realm, absolute speed seems to be stillness.<br /><br />In the human realm everything is experienced very intimately, purely at the naked flesh level. These emotions are so sharp and penetrating that we can't bear to see them, so automatically we put on masks, skin, clothing. But the moment we do that, we have second thoughts - after all, we do like to experience these passions and emotions in their naked quality. In the human realm there is that kind of ambiguity.<br />The bardo experience of the human realm has a hallucinatory quality, or illusory body, which is precisely the transparent nature of experiences: that we see, yet we don't see. Is it real, or is it pure imagination? We typically \\"find ourselves\\" in this situation, yet we don't know what we are doing here. This ambiguity can only be resolved by not panicking, accepting and just going along.<br /><br />The animal realm involves the utterly self-conscious self-righteousness of being proud of your confusion. You feel you have something to hold on to, and you do not want to give in or to yield. You would even fight for it, and you're constantly trying to overpower others. The basic twist of ego is that such basic uncertainty doesn't become humble, but instead becomes proud. And one is not quite certain whether this person is crying because of his or her humiliation, or laughing because of his or her sinister opportunities.<br />Dreaming is based on the confusion of not being quite certain whether you are sleeping or not. The dream bardo, which is connected to the animal realm, is a way of seeing yourself in that particular uncertainty. You are uncertain whether you are weak or powerful, aggressive or peaceful.<br />Confusion and uncertainty intimately belong to each step that you have to go through in the bardo experience of the dream world, which is a very valuable and personal experience.<br /><br />Hunger and thirst and trying to find an alternative to them is the hungry ghost realm. There is a constant demand for something, constantly being busy at something, constantly wanting to learn, wanting to know, wanting to \\"get it\\".<br />There is however a difference between that kind of hunger and grasping, and actual relationship with the subject. It is like the difference between reading the menu and deciding to eat. You are not sure what you like better: actually consuming or all the time preparing to consume.<br />Several types of craziness or levels of hallucination are involved in this realm. You dream of food, and the whole world becomes that shape. You go toward it, but when you get near it, the chocolate ice cream begins to become just a pile of rocks. Suddenly the waiters and waitresses become the guardians of the food. Or you rush to the food, you pick it up and eat. But the minute you swallow it, it turns into flames in your stomach and begins to burn you. There is a constant frustration of not being able to be fulfilled completely.<br /><br />The experience of the hell realm comes from deliberate, basic aggression, from wanting to destroy your projection. The perceiver is extremely painful, so there is the suicidal mentality of wanting to destroy the perceiver of the mirror as well as the mirror itself. There is constant destruction going on.<br />The bardo of death, connected to the hell realm, has to do with the claustrophobia of pain and pleasure, the sudden peak of anger in which you are uncertain whether you are actually trying to destroy something or whether you are trying to achieve something by destroying.<br /><br />To conclude:<br /><br />The author provides very good pictures of the various bardo experiences, and makes them felt. Nowhere else in Buddhadharma literature have I found such precise observations.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I do have the following critical remarks:<br /><br />1. I think the author should have explained the six paramitas, or transcendent virtues, that serve as effective, \\"soothing\\" antidotes to the afflictive emotions (kleshas) of each realm. Such as: patience for the hell realm, generosity for the hungry ghost realm, and so on.<br />2. I think the author should have explained the transcendent wisdoms that are inherent in each afflictive emotion. For instance: all-accomplishing wisdom of the jealous gods' realm, discriminating wisdom of the human realm, mirror-like wisdom of the hell realm, and so on.<br /><br />These aspects can however be found in other books by Chogyam Trungpa. Nevertheless I would have liked them explained in this context as well.<br /><br />The book also has the drawback that is edited from transcriptions of two seminars and therefore the information becomes a bit scattered.<br /><br />No matter what, it will probably take a long time to digest the subject matter of this book, due to its profound nature and because of some drawbacks as mentioned above.  But I do think it's a marvelous book, opening psychological perspectives that are nowhere else in dharma literature explained from such a point of view, in such detail.<br /><br />On a final note: It may be that this book (or even this review) triggers profound frustration or pain in the reader. It may be that you feel you're close to something extremely valuable, but you just can't get it. I know from my own experience that in such a situation talking to someone may be very useful. You may want to visit a kind-hearted and skilful Buddhist monk or nun, or even a kind teacher, and confess your distress. I'm sure they will really listen to what you have to say. This might well provide the opening you're looking for.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this book, and take it easy...a constant demand for something, constantly being busy at something, constantly wanting to learn, wanting to know, wanting to \\"get it\\".

Among Junayd's companions and disciples were such well-known figures as Nuri, al-Kharraz, Ibn `Ata, Ruwaym, Jurayri, Shibli, and Mansur Hallaj.<br /><br />Junayd of Baghdad was the leading master of the \\"School of Baghdad\\", which particularly favored \\"sobriety\\" (sahw) over \\"intoxication\\" (sukr) in mystical love. In contrast, the Persian Sufi masters of \\"Khorasan\\" favored intoxication over sobriety.<br /><br />Part 2 of this book contains introductions to the doctrines of Junayd, particularly his doctrines of Tawhid (divine Unity), Mithaq (divine Covenant), Fana (dissolution in the divine Presence), and Sahw (mystical sobriety).<br /><br />This is a good, scholarly study of an outstanding Sufi master.

Bodhichitta can be understood as having two aspects, ultimate and relative. It is the basis of both samsara (endless cyclic existence) and nirvana (peace).<br /><br />All of the Buddha's teachings can be subsumed under the two categories of shamatha (tranquil abiding) and vipasyana (direct, spontaneous insight in the nature of reality). Therefore, in all vehicles of Tibetan Buddhism, these two categories appear.<br />On the one hand they are experienced \\"mixed\\" together; while on the other hand they appear as relative separate stages in practice, which may be stressed, the one or the other:<br /><br />First-turning (sutra hinayana) teachings: \\"renunciation\\" and insight in \\"karmic causality\\";<br />Second-turning (sutra mahayana) teachings: \\"emptiness\\" and insight through transformative \\"compassion\\";<br />Third-turning (tantrayana) teachings: \\"generation stage\\" (cultivating intrinsic purity) and \\"completion stage\\" (dissolution towards intrinsic perfection);<br />Mahamudra (Great Seal) teachings: \\"luminous emptiness\\" and \\"pure bliss\\";<br />Dzogchen (Great Completion) teachings: \\"trekcho\\" (cutting through all distractions and obscurations) and \\"togal\\" (the \\"leap-over\\" of spontaneous presence).<br /><br />[I read this in the Preface of \\"Medicine Buddha Teachings\\" by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, ISBN 1877294152].<br /><br />This book is a practical guide to the two types of meditation that form the core of Buddhist spiritual practice, particularly from the Sutra perspective.

Chod is particularly famous for its teaching on transforming the aggregates of self into an offering of food for demons, as a compassionate act of self-sacrifice.<br /><br />\\"With the hook of compassion I catch those evil spirits. Offering them my warm flesh and warm blood as food, through the kindness and compassion of bodhichitta, I transform the way they see everything, and make them my disciples.\\" (Machik Labdron)<br /><br />The general attitude of the Chod practice is that the meditator does not renounce the world by protecting him- or herself from afflictive emotions, but deliberately evokes these emotions by entering situations or encountering objects that will make them arise, in order to cut through (chod) them and use them on the path of meditation.<br /><br />This great book, which is already \\"Machik's complete explanation\\", together with \\"Machig Labdron and the Foundations of Chod\\" by Jerome Edou (ISBN 1559390395), will give the reader a thorough and complete overview of this great subject.<br /><br />\\"To consider adversity as a friend<br />is the instruction of Chod\\"<br />- Machig Labdron	2004-11-15

What sets it apart is that it purifies basic misconceptions about the method for generating compassion in our continuum and the way to cultivate it. And the author does so in a truly vast way, with historical implications, I believe.<br /><br />This book contains lectures by Ven. Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche on the Indian master Kamalashila's \\"Treatise on the Stages of Meditation in the Middle Way School.\\"<br /><br />Kamalashila was called to Tibet by King Trisong Detsen at a time when genuine understanding of authentic Buddhadharma (as planted by Shantarakshita) was at stake. The trouble did not come from the outside but from inside forces: the truly great (!) bodhisattva Hwa Shang Mahayana taught a slightly different dharma, and consequently everyone became confused. Kamalashila beat Hwa Shang Mahayana in a debate, after which the lineage of dharma taught by the latter slowly evaporated and the lineage of the dharma taught my Shantarakshita and Kamalashila developed in a pure fashion.<br /><br />The same thing seems to repeat in our current times. Authentic Buddadharma, according to Tibetan Sutra and Mantra, was introduced only a few decades ago in the West, outside of Tibet. An now, in order to nurture and protect this new development, I feel that the effort made by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche (and whom he represents) amounts to the same as what Kamalshila has done so many centuries ago.<br /><br />In the words of Thrangu Rinpoche (from the Introduction): \\"These treatises were composed newly in order to help the people of Tibet when the teachings of the Buddha were initially being established in Tibet. Now, because the teachings of the Buddha are beginning to flourish in America, I thought it would be helpful if I were to present these treatises, which are not like others.\\"<br /><br />As a side note: The author also explains how Kamalashila came to Tibet twice in the body of Padampa Sangye. In that body, he disseminated the methods for practicing \\"the pacifier,\\" also called \\"cutting\\" (ch&ouml;d). Padampa Sangye was indeed the guru of Machig Labdr&ouml;n, who developed the Ch&ouml;d of Mahamudra from the Prajnaparamita, and became the lineage holder.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as a must-read to anyone who cares to read essential practice as taught from Sutra perspective in Tibetan Buddhist transmission.

Now we may get an inside picture through this wonderful autobiography, translated by a thorough scholar (William Chittick). Moreover, it may correct certain childish misconceptions we may have had about both Rumi and Shams.<br /><br />This is an authentic biography, however rather atypical. From the translator's introduction: \\"The first thing we need to remember about the Discourses is that it was not written by Shams. Rather, one or more individuals in Rumi's intimate circle took notes while Shams was speaking, often, but not always, when Rumi was present. (...) What is certain is that he never saw a final version - or if he did, it has not survived.\\" Consequently, this autobiography does not read as a continuous story, but consists of random notes in the original manuscript, organized however into chapters in this English translation.<br /><br />Who was Shams Tabrizi? You must read the book in order to answer this question for yourself. Shams recounts: \\"What then do you know of me? I went into that thicket where lions wouldn't dare to go (...) and awesomeness settled into me.\\" Indeed, what did anyone know of him?<br /><br />What is clear from this book is that Shams's heart-secret (sirr-e asrar) was no match for contemporary mystics, although he did respect just one or two or perhaps a few.<br />With every encounter he would reveal the other's state (hal) and spiritual standing (maqam) through gnostic insight, and invariably he would manifest as idol-breaker. Then they would flee his presence, being incapable to tolerate his face.<br />He is very critical even of the great ones in Sufism, particularly Bayazid Bistami and Mansur Hallaj, whom he frequently mentions in comparisons, or even Junayd. He says: \\"The station of `He is the Real' is far above that of `I am the Real'. And explains: \\"The difference between me and the great ones is just that - what I have inwardly is exactly what's outward.\\"<br /><br />He appears to have been vastly different from other Sufi masters. Whereas others would train recipients with \\"preparedness\\" to become saints (wali) and masters in their own right, Shams was made for a different task. He says: \\"I haven't come to do with the common people in this world - I haven't come for them. I've put my finger on the pulse of those who guide the world to the Real.\\"<br />He explains, \\"If everyone in the inhabited quarter was on one side and I was on the other, I would answer every one of their difficulties. I would never flee from speaking (...) The inhabited quarter is where the people reside. The other three quarters burn from the shining of the sun, so people don't live there.\\"<br /><br />All his life he served the Companion. \\"My goal in the idol-temple is the image and beauty of Your face. If I want the idol of words for the sake of those meanings, it will not happen without the Companion. The Companion must be there.\\"<br />And elsewhere: \\"When someone finds the way to be my companion, his mark is that companionship with others becomes cold and bitter for him.\\" And: \\"I have a pearl within me. Whenever I show its face to anyone, he becomes estranged from all his companions and friends.\\"<br /><br />He would accept no disciple, but all his life he was waiting for the one, to become his sole companion; who was to be Jalalludin Rumi. Shams: \\"From the day I saw your beauty, inclination and love for you sat in my heart.\\"<br />And he explains: \\"There are many great ones whom I love inwardly. There's affection, but I don't make it manifest. Once or twice when I made it manifest, I did something while keeping company with them, and they didn't know and recognize their duty in companionship. I took it upon myself not to let the affection become cold. When I made it manifest with Mawlana, it increased and did not lessen.\\"<br /><br />If you read carefully, you may discover from the text the universal rule of companionship and its graceful severity: \\"What is before your heart? Say whatever there is! If there is an obstacle, tell me about it. If you tell me about the obstacle, I will teach you the Path. It will become easy, because I know the Path better than you.\\"<br />And elsewhere: \\"Whatever the state that comes, you should quickly tell the companion about it and be done with it. Don't think, \\"How can I talk like this to the companion?\\" The companion will see it, even if you don't talk about it.\\" And: \\"As long as pride and existence are within you, you must say `God is greater', and you must intend the sacrifice.\\"<br /><br />\\"Without doubt, whenever you sit with someone and are with him, you will take on his disposition. On whom have you been gazing that tightness should have come into you? If you look at green herbs and flowers, freshness will come. The sitting companion pulls you into his own world. That is why reciting the Koran purifies the heart, for you remember the prophets and their states. The form of the prophets comes together in your spirit and becomes its sitting companion.\\"<br /><br />What they experienced in their mutual company transcended the secret-of-secrets of anyone but themselves. Rumi sung in verse: \\"The whole description of Godhead in Shams of Tabriz transcends any notions concerning free will and ordainment.\\" While Shams: \\"This was a cask of Divine wine, its lid caked with grime. No one was aware of this. The cause of this cask being opened was Maulana. Whoever seeks to understand this must be aware that the cause has been Maulana.\\"<br /><br />We do not know what befell Shams when he finally disappeared. After Rumi's death, Fakhruddin `Eraqi (his contemporary poet-mystic) would often speak of Rumi; he would sigh and say, \\"No one ever understood him as he should have been understood. He came into the world a stranger, and left it a stranger.\\"<br /><br />When one reads a translation cum introduction by a scholar, one doesn't want to \\"read\\" the ego of the scholar between the lines. One doesn't want to be put on sidetracks by speculative claims that serve nobody but vain academia. Far from such limitations, I think Chittick has done a thorough scholarly job. This book is a must-own for anyone seriously interested in Islamic Sufism (or any tradition for that matter) in general, and (auto)biographies of mystics in particular, even though this autobiography forever remains: advanced reading.<br /><br /> \\"I'll not put you in the heart or you'll be wounded,<br />I'll not keep you in the eye or you'll be lowly.<br />I'll give you a place in the spirit, not the eyes or the heart,<br />so you'll be my companion at the least breath.\\"<br /><br />\\"Even if it be after a thousand years, these words will reach those for whom they're intended.\\"<br /><br />\\"They're all seeking the benefit of knowledge. You should seek for good deeds, so that you may obtain good from the Companion.

This book is a must-own for anyone seriously interested in Islamic Sufism (or any tradition for that matter) in general, and (auto)biographies of mystics in particular, even though this autobiography forever remains: advanced reading.      \\"I'll not put you in the heart or you'll be wounded,  I'll not keep you in the eye or you'll be lowly.

Loss of balance in one part of the system invariably causes compensation in other, weaker parts, most often children - who will be adults later in their lives.<br />If the, mostly subconscious, causes of these compensations are not properly recognized and addressed, then therapy is bound to fail. If however we start from fundamental insight in the system dynamics well explained in this marvelous book, then we will be empowered to take the right course of action.<br /><br />All sorts of causes are phenomenologically explained in this book, in order to provide fundamental insight in their \\"karmic\\" structures of cause-result: divorce, child adoption, sexual abuse, suicide, homocide, criminal behavior, abortion, unfaithfulness in marriage, a scape-goat within a family, different sexual needs within an intimate relationship, tragic loss, re-marriage after divorce, a child mothering or fathering a parent, homosexuality, jealousy, refusal to accept a parent, legal custody, illegal children, neglecting a partner in favour of children, and so on.<br /><br />The author offers fundamental insight in these matters, as well as sound strategies to address them decisively. There is a sense of \\"natural magic\\" in his therapeutics, when Bert Helling has a client re-enact (and correct) their family constellation. One can easily understand that Hellinger must have learnt much of this from his work as a former Catholic priest among the Zulus of South-Africa, where a kind of \\"innate wisdom\\" must have been awoken in him - The short biography in the appendix anyway explains a lot about the developing \\"spirit\\" of Hellinger during his life.<br /><br />In conclusion: This book may teach us to gain our rightful place within our family system, one that is our birth-right; gain freedom from \\"systemic guilt\\", and live in peace within our family.<br /><br />What I like about this book is its redeeming spirit and its knowing heart, which anyone can understand. It is deeply human and I like it tremendously. If any book can change your life by gaining fundamental insight in family dynamics, then this is the one. I wish I could rate it with 6 stars.ve learnt much of this from his work as a former Catholic priest among the Zulus of South-Africa, where a kind of \\"innate wisdom\\" must have been awoken in him - The short biography in the appendix anyway explains a lot about the developing \\"spirit\\" of Hellinger during his life.<br /><br />In conclusion: This book may teach us to gain our rightful place within our family system, one that is our birth-right; gain freedom from \\"systemic guilt\\", and live in peace within our family.<br /><br />What I like about this book is its redeeming spirit and its knowing heart, which anyone can understand.

Rejecting her presence would then imply defeat for the adept involved, as if her presence, and the inherent dynamics of that presence, signalled a test from the Unseen.<br /><br />Another class of stories involves spiritual partnership between a male and female Sufi adept. This phenomenon is called \\"ham-dam\\" or \\"ham-nafas\\" (literally: \\"together in breath\\") in Islamic sufism, which means a crossing of the life-paths of these two, breathing in the same spirit, as they do. The meeting of these two often signals a phase of spiritual transmutation (or alchemy), in their mutual presence.<br /><br />And then there are of course examples of Sufi women who choose to refuse any such partnership, claiming that only God could be her partner - and God knows best.<br /><br />This book contains wonderful stories as well as beautiful poetry. It is is very worthwhile to be read by anyone who is interested in these subjects.	2004-10-27

In the creation stage, practitioners visualise themselves in the form of the enlightened deity. In the completion phase this visualisation is subseqently dissolved.<br />As such, \\"creation\\" and \\"completion\\" of tantric mahayana (or vajrayana) are the equivalents of \\"shamatha\\" (tranquillity meditation) and \\"vipashyana\\" (insight meditation) of sutra mahayana.<br /><br />The book is a translation of an exposition by Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul Lodr&ouml; Thaye, who designed this text as a guide to meditation practice. It was originally written entirely in verse, in the style of the songs of realization and other inspiration spiritual literature of Tibet.<br /><br />This book is very accessible and clear, and it will certainly give the reader a better understanding of what tantric practice is all about. A must-read, for sure.<br /><br />There is one book which is very useful to continue on this subject (as a companion book): \\"Generating the Deity\\" by Gyatrul Rinpoche (ISBN 1559390557).<br /><br />Another excellent book, \\"Tsongkhapa's Six Yogas of Naropa\\" (ISBN 1559390581), in a translation by Glenn Mullin, is a comprehensive treatise on the completion stage of Highest Yoga Tantra (according to the Geluk transmission).

For instance, he does not admit the Divine essence of the Creator to be separate from the creation. He considers eternity to be connected to the existence of the universe, as the soul, Paradise, Hell, and the angels are all created and a part of the universe. Hell is nothing other than the effect of spiritual pain produced by wrongdoings, and Paradise nothing but the peace and joy that are the effect of right actions.<br /><br />\\"To succeeding generations, \\"Inspirations\\", Shaikh Badruddin's most important work on mysticism, has been as controversial as the political incidents that affected his life.<br /><br />\\"His desire to live a quiet, secluded life was proven by his flights from power - from worldly power at the court of Timurlane and from religious power in Egypt as the heir of his shaikh. Finally, in Edirne, he was cornered; there was no place else to run, and his public destiny could no longer be avoided. Shaikh Badruddin's acceptance of martyrdom is a confirmation of the Prophetic precept:<br /><br />\\" \\"The faithful one is he who, when he encounters a wrong, tries to set it right by his hand. If he cannot, he wishes for it to be changed. The one who does not care and does not even wish for the wrong to be remedied, lacks faith even as much as a grain of mustard seed.\\" \\"<br /><br />This book is a must-read for anyone interested in these aspects of Islamic Sufism.	2004-10-27

Ringu Tulku: \\"If one wants to get a complete picture of Tibetan Buddhism as a whole, especially from an inner perspective, I think there is no book more important to read than The Autobiography of Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul the Great. This is the autobiography of a yogi who studied, practiced, and found the essence of each and every spiritual path in Tibet. Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul was a true saint, a great scholar, an exemplary teacher, a renowned physician, a peacemaker, and one of the most prolific writers of Tibet. The Five Great Treasuries of Kongtrul, which comprise over one hundred volumes of a thousand pages each, enshrine all the wisdom of Tibet. It is so very easy to see that if he did not compile, transmit, and publish these teachings, most of them would have been lost during the recent turmoil in Tibet.<br /><br />\\"Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul's greatest contribution, though, is seen as being the Ri-m&eacute; movement that he and Jamyang Kyents&eacute; Wangpo revived, a movement that is actually the essence of the Buddhist approach. (...)\\"<br /><br />In the introduction to \\"Creation and Completion; Essential Points of Tantric Meditation\\" the enormity of Kongtrul's contribution is aptly expressed by the following quotation from the late Dudjom Rinpoche: \\"So if we examine Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul's career (...) it is as if he spent his whole life as an author. None the less, if one thinks of his teaching and propagation of the empowerments, guidance, esoteric instructions, recitational transmissions, and so forth (...) it is as if he spent his whole life teaching and propagating. And, if one investigates how (...) he experientially cultivated the stages of creation and perfection associated with inconceivable myriads of mandalas, it seems as if he passed the length of his life in a retreat house sealed up with mud. Likewise, if one considers (...) his legacy in connection with the ten modes of doctrinal conduct, it is as if he passed his whole life diligently engaged in the sphere of work and activity. In these ways [his career] was inconceivable, within only the reach of those who are truly sublime.\\"and activity.

(...) Exceptionally, the Shangpa Kagyu lineage remained for seven generations a one-to-one transmission, each master transmitting these instructions to a single disciple. (...) This lineage has managed to remain unobtrusive; most of the primary lineage holders have chosen to live as concealed yogis, to avoid institutional responsibilities, and to commit themselves to solitude and meditation.\\"<br /><br />From the translator's preface: \\"Lamas of every tradition - Gelug, Sakya, Nyingma, and Kagyu - have received and practice the Shangpa tradition. The lineage is extremely discreet but not elusive; it silently pervades the Himalayan region yet is centered nowhere. In this the Shangpa lineage resembles another lineage of tantric meditation begun by a woman: the Severance (Ch&ouml;), established by Machig Lapdr&ouml;n, a Tibetan reincarnation of one of the Shangpa lineage founders, Sukasiddhi. Her spiritual children as well have always preferred the freedom of homelessness, the exhilaration of total renunciation, and good-natured harmony with one and all. The Severance lineage often walked hand-in-hand with the Shangpa teachings through the walls of Tibet's religious institutions, whereas less ethereal traditions were often stopped at the gates.\\"<br /><br />The importance of the Shangpa lineage is expressed by the following quotation (on p.257 of the text): \\"Looking back over more than a thousand years of the Tibetan experience of Buddhism, Kongtrul felt that Kyungpo Naljor was the finest accomplished master Tibet had ever produced, bar none.\\" And further: \\"No authoritative testimonial to the greatness of this master surpasses that of Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul, who expressed this opinion of Kyungpo Nalyor in \\"An Impartial History of the Sources of Spiritual Instruction\\".

This class of literature developed within the Kadampa school, the earliest of the organized Tibetan Buddhist denominations, and was introduced to Tibet by Atisha Dipamkara, best known for his teachings on \\"The Seven Points of Mind Training\\". Atisha's arrival in western Tibet in 1042 is universally regarded as one of the great landmarks in the history of Tibetan Buddhism. (...) By the fifteenth century, the Kadampa evolved into the Gelukpa.\\"<br /><br />\\"In fact, lojong is not just a genre of religious literature, but the defining ideology of the Kadampa school itself, just as the Great Perfection (dzogchen) is for the Nyingmapas, the Great Seal (mahamudra) for the Kagyupas, the Paths and Fruits for the Sakyapas, and the Stages of the Path (lamrim) for the Gelukpas.\\"<br /><br />These teachings are the Kadampa alternative to what amounts to the same in for instance Severance (Ch&ouml;): very powerful yogic methods for fighting the view of a real personal identity and the self-cherishing attitude.<br /><br />The relevance of this knowledge was expressed, for instance, by Shantideva, when he said: \\"Whoever wants to save himself and others quickly should practice the holy secret of exchanging self and others.\\"<br /><br />The deity of the two practices in this book is Yamantaka, the wrathful form of Manjushri. Yamantaka means \\"he who brings an end to Yama,\\" or \\"Yama's terminator\\".

The numerically definite cosmology of the Individual Way (hinayana), in which the collective force of the evolutionary actions of sentient beings creates the world, and therefore all beings contribute to the creation of the world;<br />2. The cosmology of infinity buddha-fields of the Universal Way (mahayana), in which infinite world-systems come into being as phantom appearances, through bodhisattvas purifying buddha-fields, in which they may fulfill their heroic vows to liberate all beings. The universe is conceived as a cycle without commencement that repeats itself until all beings are liberated from the sufferings of cyclic existence;<br />3. The cosmology of the Tantra of the Wheel of Time (Kalacakra), which establishes a correspondence between the macrocosm and microcosm in terms of the formation of the universe and fetal development, and between the configuration of the universe and the shape and size of the human body;<br />4.  The noncosmology of the Dzog-chen (Great Perfection) system, drawing extensively from Longchenpa, in which the primal creative cause of the universe is neither the evolutionary actions of beings nor the interrelationships of the compassion of the buddhas and sentient beings, but rigpa, a state of pure and total awareness, which is nothing other than the primordially pure ground of being itself. Failure to recognize the primordially pure nature of the ground of being is unawareness, which itself arises from intrinsic awareness. The primordial freedom that one seeks to attain by practicing the spiritual path is something that one already possesses.
