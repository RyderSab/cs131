It also affirms that it is ultimately the actions felt in the heart, not the deeds done in the body, which are the main cruxes of the problem.

It's an introduction to Occultist thought and it's fascinating partly just because of the way it's presented.  I'd recommend it to people just starting out in Occultism such as Magick, Alchemy and the like.  Good book.	2001-04-10

This is a pretty fascinating book, containing the works attributed to Hermes in English as well as the non-translated version, revealing one version on one page and the other version on the next page;  Thus, when one reads the book, they find the non-translated version on one page and the English version on the other page, with footnotes and stuff to help out.  Overall, a good book, and it gives some understanding of the thinking of the ancient Magickians and other Occultists.  Worth getting, overall.	2000-09-24

I got some stuff out of this, such as various tips on how to lose one's  interest in the physical life and physical body to focus on their spiritual  one;  Their soul.  It also talks about how the eye is a tool to send  messages, and how dreams can contain symbols as to what needs to be  corrected.  It's an interesting read, with more info to be comtemplated  than one finds in the Bardon books, which are more designed towards  practice and less about philosophy.  Still, there is much to be practiced  in this book and you won't be disappointed if you get it.	2000-07-31

This book contains several prophecies of the great Alchemist Paracelsus, written all in symbolic form.  Thus, to interpret the meaning of the prophecies one must unravel what the symbolism in his words represents.  He  describes certain times and events as being &quot;like this&quot; or  &quot;like that&quot; and you must try to unravel what the likeness really  represents.  Kind of like trying to interpret who the Anti-Christ will be  given the description in the Bible, or decided what the grasshoppers are  supposed to be, if not actual grasshoppers. An interesting book that might  be fun to ponder and comtemplate the meaning of.	2000-06-28

This book is an excellent introduction to what happened from the Lenin to Stalin years in the USSR.  Anyone who's curious how a country meant to turn into a Socialist Democracy became a Totalitarian Tyranny will want to read  this book!  This book enlightens the reader on how that country was  corrupted by Stalin, and it also attacks some of the myths spread about the  Bolsheviks which are still propagated today ( the German gold idea, for  instance ).  For those who think that Stalinism is the natural outcome of  Bolshevism, read this book;  It dispels the myth.  This book should be  complemented later by books by Trotsky and Isaac Deutscher's biographical  trilogy about Lenin's second-in-command as well, but all in all, a great  book to start with for understanding the Russian Revolution.	1999-12-26

This book is a decent introduction to Alchemy, but the problem is the author goes too much into explaining other pseudo-alchemies such as Jung's &quot;Alchemical Psychology&quot; and such.

In this book, Mr. Pipes attempt to prove the superiority and neccessity of private property for the success of any type of system.  In this he shows his hideous ignorance of the writings defending other types of systems.  For instance, has Mr. Pipes ever read Karl Marx's arguments against private  property and the inherent danger in too much property being concentrated in  too few hands?  Is he perhaps not aware that Marx himself was *against*  state property, and only supported the state ownership of a *few* of the  means of production to replicate the aforementioned means for use by the  populance of the country.  It's sad Pipes is quick to condemn and slow to  learn about those ideas of systems different from the Capitalist form.  I  read through these Capitalist-loving books to see if I can find any good  arguments against Socialism ( borrowed from people, of course; I wouldn't  waste my money buying these! :P ), and I always find the same old  rumor-mongering that is so apparent in this one.  An uninformed, unvaluable  survey;  Find a better book.	1999-11-17

Lenin, drawing on the works of Marx  and Engels extensively, refutes many claims by both the Anarchists and  opportunists on the role of the state, and corrects many common errors  believed about the Marxist road to Socialism.  This is a thoroughly  informative read.  I recommend those wondering how a Communist society  would emerge after a revolution to get this book;  It will open your eyes  widely.	1999-11-02

He says all the things that noone else has the guts to say and is the voice of real, hard-working Americans, unlike our 2 parties which simply claim to be.  I'd  also like to comment on this person who does nothing more than claim  Michael Moore is a &quot;Commie&quot; and is &quot;wrong on  everything&quot;.  Why does a man's distrust of the power and influence of  the corporations make him a Commie?  Are you aware that someone can be  against the rich having all the power without being a person who supports  Red China and other similar countries?  You show yourself to be just  another over-biased Conservative looking for a progressive to badmouth and  blame your problems on.  Realize that, whether you like it or not, there is  much more truth in what Moore says than in your overly-slanted viewpoints.   I won't disagree that Michael Moore does obviously have a bias, and he does  sometimes make a mistake, but when one compares him and the effects of his  mistakes to those caused by our Corporate bigwigs and their loyal  supporters, you see that the real problem lies with folks like you.	1999-09-16

This includes many writings which do not make it into the usual Marx/Engels Readers;  Writings including Marx's Letters, his criticism of Bakunin, more  writings on economics than in the usual Reader, and so on.  One flaw of it,  though, is that it does not contain the later writings of Engels writen  after Marx's death.  I suppose this is to be expected;  It is after all  *Marx's* writings, not Engels.  However, the loss does not affect it much,  and the book is still one of the most valuable tomes of Marxism I've  bought.  I'd recommend anyone interested in the thought of Karl Marx to get  this book;  If one is interested in both the writings of Marx and Engels,  I'd recommend they get this book and the Marx/Engels Reader to supplement  it.  I have both, and both are fascinating.	1999-07-05

Trotsky describes it as a state halfway between Socialism  and Capitalism, which could be either transformed to the former through  worker action or perverted into the latter by counter-revolutionaries.  As  we see from the USSR, it is indeed the latter that prevailed.  There are a  lot of great questions which Trotsky anwers authoritatively.  Get this  book!!	1999-06-15

This is an excellent book for those who have heard the various lies put forth about Trotsky by Stalinists and their ilk.  It corrects the history of the Russian Revolution, tossing out the fumbling falsifications brought  by it's second leader, Joseph Stalin.  Trotsky's commentary is quite  informative and intelligent, and it gives insight into why the  &quot;comrades&quot; of the Soviet Party against Trotsky behaved in the  matter in which they did.

The first essay on learning how to  combat racism was quite valuable.  Many of the others were as well - hell,  most others.  This is an excellent book, and reveals the broadness of Mr.  Zinn's mind;  He is in no way limited to history-telling as his only  talent.

I reviewed this before but I notice Richard Pipes fans have found it neccessary to portray those against this book as &quot;Marxist-Leninists&quot; who let their &quot;bias&quot; get in the way  of their fair judgement of the book.  This is not true, and in reality the  reason is because we've read other books that do more justice to history,  pointing out the facts in most cases, pointing out the lack of them in some  cases ( and in some claims! ;P ), and show why the Bolsheviks did things,  why the Whites did things, and why certain things were neccessary without  making a tyrant out of one side or the other.  In other words, they present  fair, accurate, honest history, not slanted history portrayed as supposed,  unbiased &quot;truth&quot;.  One is better off reading the works of  Deutscher, which give one more understanding, before reading this somewhat  biased book.  An attempt to be fair by someone with a secret bias best  describes this book, but the more informed will note certain facts are left  out.	1999-06-04

This is *THE* book to read if you wish to learn what Communism is about, not the Stalinist perversions of Karl's system.  To all the Capitalist ignoramuses out there, read this and other works of Marx and find out how wrong, and in fact, how idiotic your assertion is that Marxism failed  because of the failure of the Soviet Union, which was a peversion of  Marxism created by Stalin.  Being one read on the works of Marx, Lenin and  Trotsky, I know that True Communism, and the struggle to achieve the same,  is the exact opposite of everything these tyrannical systems were.  Even  Lenin and Trotsky themselves realized that Stalinism was a step backwards  from Communism, and needed to be stopped.  It's really sad you can't accept  facts that contradict your view of Socialism being wicked and evil, and can  only listen to assumption-based and ignorance-based claims that  Totalitarianism is the only system that can come from Socialist struggle,  and that Socialism,  and that Socialism is somehow supposedly anti-freedom.   Socialism is anti-exploitation.  Socialism is anti-domination.  Socialism  is anti-totalitarianism.  This is what Socialism is about, and this is what  Marx was about.	1999-05-14

I had heard of Voltaire being one of the greatest critics, satirists and philosophers of the Age of Reason;  Now I see why.  He tore apart many of the myths religions used to justify promoting *their* religion as the right  one while bashing those others.  He points out that a religion claiming to  be free of superstitions and claiming to be against the same is  hypocritical if it still sees Satan as effecting in &quot;bad&quot;  behavior and similar un-Christian things.  He points out that there is no  such thing as going against one's will;  If one does, one is simply  adhering to the demands of another will, a will to do something different,  and hence going against will when given choice is impossible.

Fortunately for me, I had  read more accurate histories of the early USSR before I read this one, and  thus was able to find out the truths this one is woefully lacking in.
