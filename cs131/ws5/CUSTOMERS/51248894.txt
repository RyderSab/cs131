If you have changed to a low carb way of living, you may need to update your cookbook shelves. This is a grand choice for your treasured basic cookbook. It is diverse, and well tested. It covers lots of basics.<br /><br />One shining example is her pumpkin pie with a pecan praline crust is good enough that when you bring the regular pastry crust pie, and the diet pie with the pecan praline crust, the diet pie is devoured by those who swear that they detest diet food.<br /><br />She has some wonderful salad dressing recipes that lack all of the sugar that the commercially available dressings have.<br /><br />For the people who still think that low carb is all bacon cheeseburgers, hold the bun, read all of her vegetable recipes. She can help people to reach out to vegetables that they have never tried.<br /><br />Her cookbooks are always great to read for ideas. I may or may not prepare her recipe as it states, but it will inspire me, and give me ideas, and suggestions as to what I can do with what.<br /><br />Her suggestions of what to do with steaks are wonderful. The woman does respect a piece of meat, but gives subtle tweaks to really bring out the flavor, rather than simply drowning it, or overwhelming it.<br /><br />Most of the main dish foods in this book work quite well even if your whole family doesn't eat low carb. If some members of your family eat low carb, and some don't, you can always add starchy sides for the other family members, but let me warn you, once the family sees your \\"special food\\", they'll wonder why they have their plain vanilla side dishes, and will be grabbing for your food!<br /><br />She is more respectful of the dietary decisions that low carbers make in her choices of ingredients. Many so called low carb cookbooks are still filled with empty starchy carbohydrates, like white flour. Dana takes the high road, without making weird ingredient substitutions unless she really has to. Her foods are really good because they are real foods.<br /><br />If you have tried to get with a low carb way of life, and have had problems with boredom, his may be your tool. If you find yourself cheating, this may be your best hope. If you live with a low carber, cook up a few dishes from this, and show them how considerate, and gifted you are. If you bring her foods to any pot-luck event, nab some early, as her foods go fast.re real foods.  <br /> <br />If you have tried to get with a low carb way of life, and have had problems with boredom, his may be your tool.

This book is a great resource to help keep you on your low carb diet. Dana Carpender's books are always well done, and this is no exception. Her foods are good, and most of them are real foods, not the horrid Frankenfoods sold as low carb by many other authors. I don't spend much time in the desserts section, as I don't do many sweets.<br /><br />The Mexican Cabbage Soup (pg 202) is a great example of real, good, quick food in this cookbook. I've done 101 variations on that theme after eating this one. The entire family has eaten quite well.<br /><br />The chapter on low sugar condiments is well worth the price of the book. Make your own ketchup and a few other condiments, rather than buying special, expensive diet ones, and you've just paid for the book!	2005-01-30

There is the wonderfully big hearted, but minute Biggie, and her resident 12 year old grandson J.R. and a cast of other fun characters.<br />Biggie and J.R. go out for a big night on the town, the opening of the town's brand new, all chicken restaurant. The proprietor is nowhere to be found in all of the hustle and bustle, until he is found, served up dead with gravy on top! Biggie takes it upon herself to help her cousin, the local sheriff solve this crime.<br />During this Christmas holiday season, J.R.'s other grandparents arrive, with intentions of taking J.R. back home with them. The boy is forced to learn about love and loyalty v.s. the value of a dollar. What choice will he make? Is Biggie to busy for him anymore? What would it be like to spend Christmas, or to live with his rich grandparents?<br />As I detest spoilers I won't give any more plot elements. The sub-plots were all woven together very well. The gore factor was very light. (I will say that it was a murder tastefully done, with a flourish and garnish at that!) I don't recall any strong language or adult situations in the book. With the story taking place in the holiday season, while this book can be read at any time during the year, it may be a nice addition to the holiday reading pile.	2003-06-06

Normally, I would be afraid to pick up anyone's first mystery, but Trocheck comes off as a seasoned professional. It is a smooth fast read.<br />Callahan Garrity, former Atlanta police officer, tried her hand at becoming a personal investigator. After finding out that it was not as lucrative as she had hoped, and nearly at the end of her money, Callahan bought the &quot;House Mouse&quot; cleaning service with her hard talking, chain smoking, blue haired mother Edna Mae Garrity.<br />Running a cleaning service puts Callahan in touch with an interesting cross section of the population. Her cleaning staff is quite a colorful cast of women. Then there is the other end of the spectrum, her clientele.<br />Callahan, by an odd twist of fate, has to go clean the home of a new client when she faces a labor shortage one morning. Upon arriving on the premises, who does she find is married to one of the local society big shots, but a sorority sister from her college days. Imagine that, and Callahan wearing an apron.<br />What starts off as a routine cleaning job turns into a crime investigation. What starts as a crime investigation turns into a series of crimes being investigated, and all of this while trying to keep a business running. In the course of cleaning homes, the members of the House Mouse are in a position to learn the most intimate details about their client's lives. Her cleaning staff learns the finer points of investigating crimes, all the while cleaning house.<br />Callahan has to tap into her old connection at the police department to solve the heinous crimes. We find out quite a bit about her tenure on the force.<br />There is a wonderful thread of religious misunderstanding and education as a sub-thread of the tale. Some have criticized that this thread was not as detailed as it could have been, but I would argue that it cleared up quite a few misconceptions, enough to make that plot element work. If a reader wanted to know all of the nitty gritty details of that faith, they could research further on their own.<br />I despise spoilers, so I will not give any more on the plot, but it is a good fast read with engaging characters.<br />The gore factor is low, and there are a few salty words, but few and far between. It has a pretty lightweight feel overall.<br />I plan on reading more of Kathy Hogan Trocheck's books, and hope to see much more of Callahan Garrity and especially Edna Mae Garrity.ader wanted to know all of the nitty gritty details of that faith, they could research further on their own.<br />I despise spoilers, so I will not give any more on the plot, but it is a good fast read with engaging characters.<BR>The gore factor is low, and there are a few salty words, but few and far between.

Sophie Greenway, former food critic, is settling into her new position of owner and manager of the Maxfield Plaza hotel in St. Paul Minnesota. Her husband Bram Baldric, a talk radio personality, is not fond of her tight schedule, but Sophie assures him that their life will soon normalize. How wrong can she be? Let's see.<br />St. Paul is being taken storm by hometown girl, Constance Buckridge, internationally known cookbook author, and culinary academy founder, and her entourage. The local food world is a buzz. The entire Buckridge group takes up residence at the Maxfield Plaza. Constance is extremely protective about her private life.<br />Marie Damontraville, queen of the unauthorized biography, is tailing Constance Buckridge back to her home town, and some deeply hidden secrets that someone has been sending her hints about. Judging by the reaction of the Buckridge's, she must be on to some thread of truth.<br />A cook is sliced to death with his own cutlery, leaving one obvious suspect. Only, Sophie can't believe that the obvious could be true, so with her already overbooked schedule, she takes it upon herself to extract her long-time friend from his bad fate by trying to find the real killer, putting her own life in peril.<br />The book has a great mix of personalities sprinkled throughout the tale. They are highly believable characters, many amusing in their human frailties.<br />As I detest spoilers I will not give any more plot elements, suffice to say that there are many beautifully woven sub-plots in this book. It is a fast read with much intrigue and drama. There are some rather adult situations in the book. The language is not particularly bad, and the gore factor is rather light.	2003-06-06

Aunt Nettie is more than glad to take in her niece, as she recently lost her husband, and needs help with the business side of TenHuis Chocolade.<br />Clementine Ripley orders a plethora of expensive chocolates for a huge fund raising affair for the Animal Rescue League. When Ms. Ripley falls dead from a cyanide laced amaretto truffle chocolate, TenHuis, as well as the rest of Warner Pier is stirred up by the high profile death, and the paparazzi descend upon the town like a swarm of hungry locusts.<br />The employees of TenHuis Chocolade, as well as anyone who might have a grudge against Ms Ripley become suspects. With a high profile person that people love to hate, just who could have done it? And why?<br />Lee tries to dig to the bottom of the facts to clear herself and her aunt from the speculation that their chocolates are to die for, lest TenHuis be killed from the negative press attention.<br />This delightful treat of a book sprinkles little bits of chocolate trivia between chapters. Some of the information is really fascinating. The book is a great little indulgence. Nothing heavy or offensive, even the murder is tastefully done.

First of all, let me tell those of you who are having, or just had your first child, ignore the baby book advice that babies don't like books without bright colors. I am a mother of 4, and this book is in the top 5 books requested by the boys. It may look rather somber compared to the latest releases, but the kids love this one.<br />This book is a wonderful story of a little bird on a serious quest. He shows such determination and perseverence. There is no stopping this little bird.<br />The book is short enough to hold a child's attention at a very young age. Young children love books with a repetitive banter, and this book fulfills that criterion without annoying the adults.<br />It is a great book to snuggle up with, with a great, positive ending. I can bet that you will get years of reading out of this little book.	2003-05-15

The illustrations are humorous, and the rhythm and banter of this book is great. All of the Boynton board books are worth having, but this one is a particular gem.<br />If your child is to the age that they like the notion of call and response songs and books, they will LOVE this book. As you will see, everyone in this book is living it up, and we see them all doing fun things. But at the end of every little scenario you get, \\"But not the hippopotamus\\"<br />(It is amazing how quickly a child can learn to say hippopotamus, or what variations on that word a child will create!) But, don't fret for our poor hippo, he does get a happy ending, but....<br />READ THE BOOK! I won't give the spoiler.	2003-05-15

This book is yet another gem from Sandra Boynton. On the surface it is four animals getting dressed, and teaching colors. The elephant, the moose, and the bear all seem to be able to dress without issue, but our poor friend the turkey has a most difficult time dressing. When he errs in getting his clothing on in every instance, the page is ended with \\"Oops\\" Your children will be giggling out \\"oops!\\" at the bottom of every page.<br />I suspect that part of the appeal of this book to little guys comes not just from the love of the call and response type of banter, or the hysterical pictures, but from the frustration of trying to learn to dress yourself. This one was very popular with my 4 boys.<br />It's not too long to read to a squirmy child. This book is a good first book to read when you are trying to settle the kids down from being very active. No, I would not make this the last book of the evening, as it does beg for interaction, but it is a great transition from running around, and into other, calmer books.	2003-05-15

I told my mother about this book for years after having read it in kindergarten. She had never seen it. Well, this classic children's book is back in print, and even my mother now knows what the fuss was all about.<br />Harold is a boy chock full of imagination. He meanders about with just his purple crayon, creating his surroundings. He draws himself into situtations, and has to keep his wits about him in order to draw himself out of any trouble that results in his adventures.<br />My 4 boys always seemed to like that Harold could extract himself from whatever messes he got himself into. They are fun books, with adventures, but they end on a calming note. They are perfect for bedtime, as they don't wind the children up, but they do hold their interest. (There is a whole series of Harold and the Purple Crayon books) So, for good clean fun, as long as your little ones know not to draw on walls Harold is a never fail hit.

JoAnna Carl is another of the great cozy mystery writers writing in the food genre that has become so popular. If you like Tamar Myers or Joanne Pence, you will enjoy JoAnna Carl.<br />We start our tale, in the winter, with Lee, a heroine displaced from Texas, to Western Michigan. Lee has taken on the daunting task of looking after the business side of her aunt's chocolate factory and store, TenHuis. While she can work magic with a ledger, Lee has the troublesome problem of saying the wrong thing all of the time.<br />We follow Lee as one problem after another falls into her unsuspecting hands. With her everpresent verbal bumblings, her inteligence is easily called into question, but as it all plays out, she does find a way to extract herself, and her loved ones from all of the messes. (I won't give details, as I DESPISE spoilers!)<br />She also includes little tidbits of trivia about the appearance of chocolate in older works of mystery. Those segements are fascinating.	2003-03-31

Well, the contents of that 94 page book would scarcely have filled a greeting card, with any editing at all. If they had SAID on the label that it was for the preschool set with constant repetition, maybe I would have been able to stomach it.

You must take into account that Fern Michaels is not trying to write the great Russian novel here. The objective of this entire genre, is a nice pleasant distraction from the seriousness of real life. (And don't tell me that the men's genre of action adventure has any more literary worth. Both fill a need for escape) Disclaimer upfront, how about a review?<br />If you need a bit of a holiday lift, whether it's the holiday season or not, pick up this little book. This whole tale is about family values, and coming together for each other, no matter what, especially for the holidays. There is a great deal of reminiscing, and a good dose of wrong doing, and forgiveness.<br />Widower, Jonathan Cisco puts his mother Loretta Cisco, into a nursing home due to her failing health. Jonathan had no time to deal with his mother, and was being persuaded to modernize the candy company by his new gold digger girlfriend. Loretta's placement was sudden, and against her will. She is a strong willed woman. She was strong enough to start and run a successful candy company after being widowed in her youth. She was strong enough to take on the lion's share of the child rearing duties of her son's triplets after his wife died. This created a strong bond between the triplets and the grandmother. The triplets were incensed when they found out that their father had tossed their grandmother in a nursing home without so much as a mention to them. The triplets make it their mission to spring her from the nursing home.	2002-12-29

I need a light escape. On that note:<br />Sterling Brooks has spent nearly half a century as a bench warmer outside of heaven. He never did anything good enough to gain admission, but it seems that he mustn't have done anything bad enough to have to go the other way either. His sins were sins of omission. He didn't notice what needed to be done, thus he did not do it. Those on high decide to give him a chance to redeem himself. He is sent back to earth, to find someone who needs his help, and to help them.<br />Upon his return to earth, he starts looking for who needs help, when he stumbles across the person who he knows almost immediately is THE person whom he was sent to help. He actually learns to see the plight of others, and learns to care.<br />It is a cute, well spun tale. If you need a holiday distraction, this could well be it.	2002-12-20

If you want the basics of hair cutting, to trim your family's, or your own hair, this book is an ideal tool. As a mother who has been cutting the hair of a husband and 4 sons, I have found corrections to problems that I have been having as an amateur stylist. The first time that I skimmed this book I saw a few tips well worth the price of the book to polish the cuts that I have been giving, and to prevent errors in the future.

The first book was mostly anecdotal evidence, but this book includes far more data, from more scientific research. He worked with Dr Camarata, a speech and language pathologist from Vanderbilt university for the research of this book.<br />Yes, as before, many people will criticize this book, as they did the first. The people who will criticize this book are either the para-professionals that stand to lose money from unnecessary therapies, or the parents of children with serious issues who read no further than the dust jacket, and don't read the book with a critical enough eye to realize whether or not their child actually fits this special sub-set of late speakers. We have a strong family history of speech delays, and math intensive careers. Both my husband and father in law fit the profile, as engineers, both late speakers. I am such a strong advocate of this book, as I am a mother of 3 late speakers who fit the profile so closely it is almost scary to see it in print. It is as if they have been watching my household. All 3 of my late speakers are now speaking, and all share the extremely advanced mechanical and spatial perception skills addressed in the profile.<br />If your child is not speaking, and you see a spark of intelligence in his eyes READ the book, and really analyze your child. Don't just say, &quot;Well some kids grow out of it, mine will too&quot;, take a serious look to see if your child does indeed fit the profile. If your child doesn't fit the profile, don't criticize this line of research, as this is a REAL sub-set of late speakers, even if it is not where your child is. If the child DOES fit the profile, there are a great many support groups out there for parents of these odd little guys.	2002-12-17

Autism has no cure. You can't outgrow autism, yet mysteriously many children who don't speak are branded as autistic, yet experience a miraculous recovery.<br />This book started from an off-hand comment made by economist Thomas Sowell, in his regular column about his own son. He made a comment about his child doing quite well in upper education in a highly technical, math intensive field, after being branded as an imbecile as a child, for speech delays. Mail poured in from all over the country, most letters saying, \\"That's my boy!\\". This inspired Mr. Sowell to start researching this odd phenomenon. It seemed there was little data on late speech in children of normal or higher intelligence.<br />This first book is mostly anecdotal evidence, but as it so accurately described my husband, his father, and our children, I knew that we were on the right track. As a mother of 3 late speakers that fit the profile described in this book, I am thrilled to see that this book sparked some debate, and some research in the area of non autistic late speakers.	2002-12-17

As people realize that they will not make their intended holiday destinations in time for the holidays, it brings out the essence of each person. Tempers flare. Eventually, they become resigned to spending the holiday together, and one contribution at a time, they build a great impromptu holiday situation.<br />* Shirley, Goodness and Mercy<br />This tale is like a cross between a modern &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;. This is quite a bit lighter than either of those. If you like &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; Or liked &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, you will probably enjoy this tale. Greg Bennett has a cold empty life, and it's only getting worse. He is hitting bottom. He is reviewing all of the experiences in his life that have left him alone. Three angels are assigned to help him get his life together. With the guidance of these 3 mischievous angels he learns the magic of the holiday season, and transforms his whole life, just in time.	2002-12-16

Children will love the preposterous situations of this book, and I can't imagine a parent not enjoying it as well. We got this one last Christmas, and it has been read time and time again. If you want a book that you will get high mileage out of, this could be the one. If you don't like appreciate books that beg for a command performance, beware of this book, as you will most assuredly be asked to read this one again!	2002-11-26

In some ways this book is hard to read. You read a passage, and it sparks so many ideas in your head, that you may find it hard to keep reading, as you keep thinking of how these ideas can impact YOUR business. Some of the ideas are sure to inspire you to find better ways to set up a new business, or manage your existing business. Of course, not all of the ideas will apply to your business, but some are sure to hit any business. This is well worth the investment. I am using it for a class, and so far, I have yet to meet a classmate who has not been energized by this book. I think that this book very well may save me thousands of dollars in mistakes. Be prepared to be amazed. Keep a notebook at your side when reading this.	2002-11-22

Seeing good people at their worst was so much fun. It had great humor. I was cracking up through most of the book. This is NOT one of those sappy sweet sticky books. It is not the least bit smutty. I would be quite comfortable to let a young girl who likes romances read this. If you need a quick read to lift your holiday spirits, or to give you a holiday spirit any time that you need it, pick up this book. I will pick up more from this author. This would make a great chick film. (Sorry, not for they guys, not explosions, no nudity!)	2002-11-22

It has great outlines, and suggested scripts for you to use as is, or alter for your own purposes. They also give DETAILED directions as to how to effectively change the scripts for your own use to get great results. It can be used for insomnia, weight control, pain management, or just general behavior modification. Many books enclose a tape of generic inductions. This book offers more, by offering less. They offer the knowledge to create your own self hypnosis tapes that will be more effective than a general purpose tape intended for everyone. Hypnosis is not one size fits all. This book will teach you the tailoring that will rival professional help. Great for those who can't afford repeated professional visits or have trust issues. You know that your tapes will follow YOUR agenda.	2002-11-22

These lessons could be applied to any style of art. Now I want more of his books. He explains how motions would pull wrinkles this way or that way.<br />Even though the book is about wrinkles and drapery, it has some brilliant studies in muscles. This is a great resource to have on any budding artist's shelves.	2002-11-22

This book is filled with thousands of pictures of people doing many, many diverse activities. All of the pictures are of nude people, so as to allow the muscles to be seen clearly. This makes these 19th century photos timeless.<br />Never has anyone produced such a comprehensive reference of this sort, before, or since. He also produced classic works on the motion of animals, that you have probably seen before, whether you were aware that they were his works or not. Muybridge is a man for the ages. Hopefully, he will one day recieve the recognition that he deserves for his great contributions.	2002-11-22

I read it years ago, and loved it. I occasionally go back and reread a passage or two.<br />She discusses brain development in children at great length. She cites some of the studies that indicate that children who view Sesame Street on a regular basis, express shorter attention spans than those who do not view such programming.<br />I liked much of the in-depth physiological brain developmental information.	2002-05-27

I was already familiar with Joyce Vedral from years ago, when I used to read her body building books. I looked at this book, and all she required was a set of 3 pound dumbells. Had anyone else written the book, I would have started with my 5 pound weights, but trusting Dr. Vedral, I went out and bought 3 pound weights. Well, since she has you working with your muscles in an isometric fashion, it is far harder than you will expect. She mentions in the book that she developed this workout while she was on a book tour, promoting one of her body building books, and she didn't always have gym access. (She didn't want to get out of shape while promoting a bodybuilding book!)  Well, in finding the perfect hotel workout, she perfected the cheap home workout. I can get this workout done in limited space, without a great expendature of time or money. This is a great workout for stay at home parents, busy working parents, in short, anyone! This is a workout that you can stick to.  It doesn't require such a huge committment, as to make it difficult to stick to.  12 minutes a day is not that much to give.	2002-04-05

It gives the basic profiles of many well known fragrances. No, it does not give exact<br />recipes, but just having a starting point from some fragrances that you have loved, and knowing some of the things to avoid from some fragrances that you have detested makes this an invaluable volume!  (Avoid those costly errors!)  This is a great help to the amateur perfumer, as it helps make better use of materials, by learning from the masters.<br />Actually, his descriptions are full enough that I might even consider buying some of the scents that he describes, even without having smelled them myself!	2001-10-18

Garrison Keillor shows a great sense of humor, great rhythm in this odd tale.  Let me first warn you though, read it to yourself first once, before trying to read it aloud to a child.  If you are not familiar with gourmet cheeses you will be completely tounge tied.  My husband and I both love it, our 4 sons have all loved it, as have any friends who have sat on our couch reading it to their children.  The detail in some of the illustrations catches the eye of the slightly more sophisticated readers, while still appealing to the little ones.  I would say, for oral reading, due to the number of foreign words that this is for the adult to read to the child.	2001-10-04

This book is a great reference work that anyone who plays in HTML should have on their desk.  This book is the missing link in most technical libraries. It addresses appealing, and legible layouts, as expected, but it does so much more. It discusses cross platform compatability issues, and helps you work around the differences, or to at least KNOW what your code will do in other browsers. It also addresses formatting content for the atypical setups, like the for the handicapped, WebTV or even for PDA's and phones!	2001-08-23

This book is not for the timid, not for those who just want to just park them in front of PBS, or pack their children off to public school!  She even attacks the liberal establishment's God-send &quot;Sesame Street&quot;!  I have seen explanations of many things that I have seen in my own 4 sons in this book.  But, if you figure your job as a parent is just to pay the day care bill, and go to the 2 parent teacher conferences per year, save your feelings.  Don't read this book.  For those who want to push their children so fast that they never have a childhood. Don't read this book.  To me, just seeing the order in which different centers of the brain develop was worth the full cost of the book.  No surprize that her biggest critics are those who swear by the flashy teaching methods that have failed dismally over the last few decades. It's a shame it's out of print.	2001-06-04

This series of books is something much needed in schools today. (Even home schools!)  It is a secular character based program.  The big difference between this and the other character based programs that I've seen, is that  despite its secular nature, it still uses religious icons from diverse  cultures as examples.  There are quotes from many religious figures  throughout.  There are lists of books and stories, to use to further  illustrate the points in the different chapters.  It seems to be a well  thought out program.  I would consider it a unit study format.  This makes  it appropriate for diverse groups.  I would recommend this book for schools  or home educators.  This would be good in a religious or secular  environment.  With the similar quotes from different religions it may even  help breed acceptance of other religions.  ....	2000-08-15
