Does \\"applied\\" in this case means applied in real-world usage, or does it means \\"applied study\\" in the framework plumbing. Unfortunately for some, this book really refers to the later - the study of .NET framework inner core.<br />This book mostly focuses on the plumbing of .NET framework and how it works.  But unless you are interested in how the framework is doing thing behind the scenes, you may yourself very difficult to carry on reading to the end.  Though I really hope you get to second last chapter \\"The Garbage Collector\\" first before it gets to the book.  Believe it or not, this chapter is actually the best in the book :)<br />For those who must see inside the black-box before diving into .NET then you are in for a treat.  The in-depth coverage of the framework is quite extensive.  The sections on string and garbage collector are jewels, and you probably won't find them elsewhere.  This is the reason why I had read the book twice, actually, almost twice..one and a half to be honest.  Just could not bare myself to decipher some of the author writing the second time around.  Overall, I think the book could have been better written, and which is why it lost one star.	2003-11-14

The book thoroughly covers the general usage of ADO.NET in using direct guidelines and examples for developers to quickly grasp the basic fundumentals and to use it more efficiently. <br />The materials covered are carefully thought out.  Each chapter focuses only on the subject at hand and ends with some very interest FAQ questions which also serves as an exellent chapter 's summary!  The code examples are also very good, and are given in both VB.NET and C#.  Their average lenght are about haft a page long, which makes them easy for the brain to compile and comprehend.  The texts are printed on high quality paper and are well written which makes this book very friendly to read too.<br />If you are new to ADO.NET and want to get a solid footing on using this technology, this book would be a requirement!	2003-09-28

It was so boring to read, and not only that, it got me confused on the fundumentals of what I can do with XML.  Starting out on a new subject on the wrong foot was a huge let down and set back.  As a result,  it got me to put aside XML for months.<br />Months past and seeing my peers raving on with how easy it was to work with XML was more than I can beared.  I wanted to get back in the game and quick.  What I want was just one solid book, no boring theory, just XML to core.  I want an XML book that focuses on the fundumentals, and leave all the theory and advance mumble-jumble stuffs to the programmers to sort it out in his/her own terms.  With help from other reviews, I found that book! <br />And this is that book.  It is well organized with XML internal structures and layouts.  It explains how to use XML in plain simple steps, in plain english, and in plain diagrams.  In just days, XML was starting to unraveled itself, and I know exactly how to use it, where to use it, and when to use it.  FINALLY, xml redemption!  <br />BTW, I agreed with the other reviewer, &quot;If stranded on an island and allow just one XML book, this is the one.&quot;	2002-08-15

The first 400 pages seem to have a lot of repeating materials that are already discussed in earlier chapters, possibly due to the confusion between too many authors and lack of editors.<br />There are tons of code samples in the book, but most of them are fragmented, some are buggy, and some are very confusing.  Though pardon my criticism for I am no expert in ASP.NET, yet I felt the book could have make it clearer if it was to have a mixture of simple fundumental code examples, rather than all with excessive use of server controls.<br />Nevertheless, to fully digest the codes in this book, you really have to break away from the old ASP programming styles, which for many of us ASP savvy, is like jumping off a perfectly fine airplane - not an easy thing to do, and will take some time to get comfortable.  Regardless, coding in ASP.NET is like a new generation - lots of changes, lots of old habits to break.  :( || :) ?<br />This book does covers a lot of ground on what you can do with ASP .NET, probably more than any other books on the market at this moment (remember 1400 pages).  But the way this book cover from one subject to the next, the unfulfilled potholes will only leave you an uneasy feeling of caution.  Just like reading a reference book, if you know what you are doing, you will feel right at home.  But if you don't, you will need more books to supplement.  Just as I put in my title review and coincidently enough, this book does make a good reference too.<br />Overall, this book could have been better written and edited.  Repeated materials should have been taken out and save some trees.  For a book this size (1400+ pages), it is a low-blow to force readers in finish reading it only because of the price he/she bought it for .  Put it this way and if I may quote from this book, &quot;...time better spend watching paint dry!&quot;, or one of my favorite by Dale Rogerson, &quot;...time better spend watching metal rust!&quot;.  Yes, time like this I really missed reading the SQL book written by Rob Vieira.	2002-06-14

Tell you the truth, a few months ago, you would have to drag me kicking-and-screaming to get me in the .NET water with my VB swimsuit!  With all the rumor of many changes to VB, the idea of re-learning VB was like decaffeined coffee!<br />So for me to convert to VB .NET, it has to be quick and painless.  And this book did just that.  It cuts right through the red tape and gets straight to the core.  VB .NET language are explored from A to Z.   Aside from being labeled as a language reference, the authors go extra the mile to include dedicated chapters on significant topics in VB .NET that are new to VB such as class inheritant, new datatypes, .NET concept and framework.  Not to mention the little details such as tips and gotchas added along side with the reference section which make this book quite enjoyable to read too.<br />I recommend this book for the VB fan, including those who are reluctant to convert to VB .NET like I was.  This book is will ease your transition to VB .NET quickly and efficiently.	2002-03-31

For those of you who already own many many books on COM, your collection wouldn't be complete if you miss this one.   <br />This book continues on where many others left off.  It digs deep down and explores the areas that are ESSENTIAL to your understanding of COM's intricacies.  Many insights given in this book are rare, and you probably won't find it elsewhere.  If you are already familiar with COM, here is a book that surprisingly still intrigue you on the subjects that you think you already knew.<br />Though, I don't recommend this book for beginners.  As the matter of fact, if I was new to COM and had to write a review for this book, I probably would have only given it 2 stars.  It is not because the book is bad, it is simply that this is NOT one of those how-to-book. However, if your level is in the intermediate to advance, you will most definitely want this one.<br />So, if you do decide to get this book, here is my tip for reading it.  Don't try to read the book from front to end, for you may not find enough momentum to get pass the second chapter - that is, if you not into theory and all.  Instead, just jump to the chapters that interest you the most.  Also note the chapters near the end are very addictive, so you may want to start the book from there.  This is how I &quot;re-gained&quot; the incentive to finish the book.  <BR>You welcome:)	2002-03-20

This volume will most likely be on your desk instead of the shelf.  Base Services will definitely give you an edge in writing a multithreaded application.  It doesn't teach you how to write multithreaded app, but it sure contain invaluable information that aid in building a SOLID program where multithread enter the scene.  This volume cover topics such as processes, threads, dll, ipc, thread synchronization, file system, and the memory management in Win32 (get your highlight pen ready for this chapter).<br />Volume 2 &amp; 3 cover user and graphic device interfaces.  If you're comfortable with MFC, these two volumes will probably be sitting on the shelf and collect dust.  You only need these volumes as last resort if you can't find the documentation in question anywhere else.<br />Volume 4 &amp; 5 deal with Common controls and Windows Shell respectively.  Common controls volume is some what vague compare to its counter part documentations in MFC classes for the Visual C++ reference set.   The Shell on the other hand, is pretty comprehensive in covering the interfaces for the many areas that you normally do with Windows desktop like dragdrop, lauching an application, moving copying files, folders, etc...	2001-10-23

Maybe so, but you are probably doing it the hard way.  <br />Let me let you in a trick that I learn from Windows programming that can help you become more efficient in MFC. Place the volume 1 &amp; 2 of this reference set beside your computer on the angle desk. Yup, believe it or not, this essentially give you about 3000 pages of well indexed references to all of MFC classes from A - Z.

Because it is an excellent, and well indexed resource on C/C++ reference. Here, let me give you a quick run down on a few items that this volume has.<br />   1) Buffer Manipulation and Memory Allocation.  (can be useful when working with array).<br />2) Data Conversion core subroutines.  (they are like the abc of programming if you ask me.)<br />3) Directory and file Handling routines.  (quick solution to Windows directory)<br />4) Stream I/O and low I/O.  (very detailed topic on stream)<br />5) Searching and Sorting. (qsort, bsearch, ...there if you needed)<br />6) String Manipulation.  (very, very complete listing of string functions)<br />7) Time Managment routines.  (you will use these guys sooner or later)<br />If you looking for a C/C++ reference, I highly recommend this volume. I can't recommend the entire set because I haven't finish reading them yet.

As for the rest of the 300 remaining pages, they only serve as an introduction to MFC, and very little in (X)Controls and COM.<br />Regardless of some negative reviews on this book, I still find the book quite good, from a C/C++ reference that is.  As the matter of fact, this book does a very good job on C/C++ reference.  For example, the explanations are clear and easy to read, reference library tables are included, and code examples are short and clean.  As for the other topics, this book is just scratching on the surface of MFC, ActiveX and COM.<br />I think the negative reviews came from those who expect a COMPLETE reference on Visual C++ and others advanced topics which the cover had advertised.  Let me tell you this, it is COMPLETELY false to assume that a single book can deliver such a promise.  Why?  MFC and ActiveX control by itself can easily accommodate an entire 1500 pages book. And as for COM, this topic alone  requires at least 2 to 3 solid books, and of course, you will also need to know C++ cold!!  <br />Why I give this book 4 stars? Because I was looking for a C/C++ reference book, and this book it does a better job than most of the other books out there on C/C++.   Also because I didn't expect much from it regarding the advance topics other than an introduction.  To do so would be like expecting it to deliver a Microsoft miracle book - a COMPLETE all-in-one Visual programmer reference.  There is no such thing, and even if one does exist, you'll probably need a dolly to carry it around.	2001-04-16

This direct approach makes the book quicker to read, and in some way, it kind of goes without saying, \\"cut the chase and get to the point!\\". <br />The contents touch base with many juicy topics. It has a brief introduction to the Standard Libraries such as String and Vector, enough to tease you in getting a full book on STD LIB (I did). It also does a decent job in covering inheritance and virtual class inheritance. Type casting and namespace usage is also covered. Polymorphism is covered but kind of weak.	2001-03-21

But after having read it, I didn't find the book that good.<br />This book is like another version of the Book Online documentation with fancy wordings inserted here and there to take up space.  Also, I find the author's writing style difficult to comprehend. Phrase like \\"In this chapter, you will explored the ubiquitous, omnipotent Transact-SQL...\\". Gee, since when sql programming have to be written in POETIC language?<br />I find this book boring to read after a while - lots of fast forward reading to find the BEEF! This book contains tons of code samples, but many of them dealt with trivial materials unfortunately (in my opinion); and having to compile these trivial materials can only strain your eyes and focus.<br />Though there are some very good chapters in this book. Chapter 6 on the SELECT statement is very good. It covers a wide range of scenarios, such as sub-correlated and alias queries, plus some new features of Transact-SQL. Chapter 16 on performance is also good. Finally, chapter 18 on Full-Text search is excellent. Clear and concise, straight to the point with clean code examples. Also, it pointed out some very important issues. <br />I don't regret buying this book at all. Infact, this book does contains some valuable tips that will no doubt elevate your sql programming skill.

Infact, its contents exposed many of VB's secrets which I have never seen in many other VB books (and I had read many). The book explains the inner working mechanism of VB as to how it actually works, what really takes place behind the scene, and how it interfaces with COM. By uncovering the VB black box, the book shows you how to by-pass its limitation and squeeze every ounce of performance out of your VB application right down to the assembly language!  I have been waiting for a VB's secret book like this for a long, long time. Guys like Matthew and Ted Pattison whom I consider are a big blessing to the VB community when it comes to advance VB with COM. Mathew's book bridges some of the power of C++ into VB application WITHOUT using C++, while Ted's book is a guide as to how your components intergrated with its host where building a scalable application is concerned (a must read for any developer coding component for ASP or MTS in ANY languages).    Let me give you one example of how this book is a gem. In one of my web project with VB and ASP, I need a way to partition a byte array and send it to a file output stream without having to copy any data to a temporary array in partitioning. I never thought you can do this with VB until Matthew shows how you can grap a hold of the SafeArray descriptor's pointer and manipulate its structure in VB like you would in C. I love this technique so much that I even give it a name - 'The Virtual Array'. (...)  CopyMemory and VarPtrArray are the only two API declared functions I used to do the trick.  So for those negative reviewers on customs tool and hacking, hmmm... I don't know:)     I believe the only programmers who are capable of writing a VB book like this have to be from the team that created VB itself, and I think Matthew is one of them. So for those VB programmers out there, especially those who find the OleViewer and the Object browser tools are the things next to bread and butter, this book is an absolute MUST have!	2001-01-11

This is one of those book that likes to hang around your desk (like your cat) while you programming.  It makes quite a good reference book on VB 6, and it doesn't cost you an arm and and a leg either.  For the content of  this book, I give it 4 stars.  But consider the price in which it is  selling for, it deserves one more star.	1999-11-22
