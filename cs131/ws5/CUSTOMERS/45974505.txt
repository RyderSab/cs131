The story was not the main motivator, as much as the writing style and character development. I agree with other reviewers re: the similarity to Tom Wolfe. In fact I loved the Economic College Class chapters so much, that I copied them and sent them to my son who is taking economics in college.	2003-11-13

I could not really see the rationalization for why the killer would kill 4 people. While there were some explanations given, I just didn't buy it. However, this story was much better than STALKER.	2001-09-12

This was truly a ridiculous story. Ugly ducking at age 34 turns into swan and falls in love. And along the way, there is a supposedly a mystery going on. Mr Perfect was quite good. Too bad this wasn't also.	2001-09-12

This novel was different; I got into the story of Patrick Wallingford losing his hand to a lion right away and really liked it. I am amazed at the imagination of John Irving. I really found myself laughing at the oddities of these characters. It was a quick read. As long as you don't take it too seriously, you'll love it.	2001-09-07

I really the enjoyed the storyline with its many twists. When I thought I knew what was going to happened, I was surprised. Also, I really empathized with Joe Antonellis, the hero of the novel as well as the other many colorful characters in the story. I really thought the ending was good. Different from many other novels.	2001-09-02

The book indicates that she was a truly loving, caring and friendly person despite Hollywood pressures. It became repetitive when it was often repeated how Natalie was scared of deep dark water, fearful of drowning and how controlling her mother was. I would have liked an update in the novel as to what her children are doing 20 years later and how they have survived this tragedy. I was also wondering if RJ still drinks! I walked away feeling that her death was a horrible accident due to intense inebriation on everyone's part.	2001-08-27

While I liked all of the characters in the story, the idea of this idyllic living was a bit farfetched. Certainly not the real world as most people know it. I will continue to read James Patterson as soon as his novels are published.	2001-08-21

It was a novel that you could just NOT put down; a real page turner. This story on the other hand is very boring. Nothing to hold the reader's interest. I was especially offended by the Ted Turner/Jane Fonda comparison. I doubt that that was part of Jaqueline Susann's original outline. I also felt that the reappearance of Gretchen was a little far fetched as well.	2001-08-20

Why it is called &quot;The Jury&quot; is certainly questionable. I have some thoughts, but that might give away the ending which was good and unpredictable. The story of Dr. Crone was slow and tiresome. The trial wasn't particularly interesting either.	2001-08-20

I find his novels (usually based on real crimes) to be fast paced and interesting. This book is just a rehash of previously written Vanity Fair articles; which I didn't know when I got it. I enjoyed reading the stories of his daughter and the Menendez brothers, but living in LA, I was really tired of how much OJ there was. I also got tired of reading about Michael Viner and Dove Books. Too many names listed and all of their connections, which took away from the storyline.	2001-08-20

Wish I could stop reading a book once I start it, because this would be one that would qualify. Story seemed convulted, boring, and way too technical that made it implausible. It was very hard to picture the final train scene. I did like the ending though (maybe because I couldn't wait to get there). Nowhere near as good as &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;	2001-08-03

The story mostly discusses the families of slaves that had white fathers and the difficulties that they faced after the civil war. Really loved seeing the pictures of some of the characters and really felt it was non-fiction. However, when I read the ancestoral chart that was presented before each woman's story, it somewhat gave away the story that was going to be told.	2001-07-30

I really enjoyed reading it initially; however as the story progressed, the ending was very predictable and the repetitveness of booze and screwing around became boring. Also, this book is very similar to the movie North Dallas Forty (even though I don't know which came first). Read Outlaws and Letter of the Law which in my opinion are better Tim Green stories.	2001-07-10

Kinsey investigates current wife, ex wife, business relationship of Dr. Purcell. The story has another side story re: a potential new relationship for Kinsey that has a surprise end but has nothing to do with her current case.

My guess is that if you a computer tech whiz, there are probablly a lot of implausibilities in this story; but if you're not and you can handle all the acronyms and are somewhat into computers, you'll like it. The main character, Wyatt Gillette (a hacker)is released from prison temporarily to help find another hacker who is murdering people based on a computer game. Lots of surprises and twists.

Too much going on with Michael Travis with the Russians, the CIA, Deschamps. Began to be unbelievable when the President actually allows an unsavory hero to be at the same location as his daughter who is in a catatonic state (like there's no place else in the world to hide out!)yet tells the Riley sisters not to talk to him. How they are able to sneak out of the US to Amsterdam, another implausibility. Couldn't wait to finish it so I could move on to another story.	2001-07-03

Stone Barrington is asked to find a woman that Todd, a billionaire met in a restaurant in New York who went to Palm Beach (Todd doesn't even know her name). Of course Stone finds her almost immediately and discovers that he has previously defended her. Puhleeze! And then the billionaire allows him to stay on his yacht where of course Stone immediately beds Todd's assistant (I really don't what to call her, but she sleeps on the yacht too). And then there's Stone wacko &quot;wife&quot; who shows up. Story was way too stupid. Bring back Vance Calder from the dead. Stone is too boring at this point.	2001-06-04

I'm a huge fan of Lucas Davenport, but could do without the baby making part of the story. I liked how we knew who dunnit right from the start and saw how Lucas figured it out. Was happy with the ending even though it was predictable. I always look forward to Sandford's new books and will continue to do so.	2001-06-04

Dominick Pindle is a 15 yr.old boy going thru some severe family issues with his mother &amp; father as well as the hardships of entering adulthood. Its a sad story that hightlights the downfalls when people do not communicate with each other. Some of the actions of Dominick were implausible.	2001-06-04

While she did some things that were totally ridiculous that put her in constant danger, I still enjoyed her character. This novel has a lot of very brutal scenes that are depicted very graphically. I usually enjoy the blood and gore stories, but this one got me a bit squimish. I will definitely put Kyle Mills on my list of authors to read.	2001-05-08

I really loved the Pudge character. I really didn't like the paragraphs whereby it seemed to be a lecture on what being a gangster entails. Story slows down from the 1960's to 1996. Some very brutal scenes. Still love Carcaterra's Sleepers the best.	2001-05-03

I really enjoyed Kristen Lord, her daughter, Amy and really liked Carl Lupo, in my opinion, the hero of the story. I really didn't like the Alan Gregory character, who I gather from previous reviews is a continuing character in White's books; his wife Lauren on the other hand was inspirational. I also agreed with another reviewer re: the annoyance of the &quot;whales&quot;. It was certainly interesting to read about the policies of the Witness Protection Plan. I could not stop for the last 100 or so pages. I will read another Stephen White novel in the future.	2001-04-27

I read it in one sitting. While the who dunnit was somewhat predictable, I still enjoyed it. There was however,an occurence at the end while sad was unpredictable. I like this character, Lindsay and hope to see more of her. How Patterson ties the 3 couple's murders together was interesting.	2001-04-19

What a disappointment. I couldn't wait to finish; even thought of just stopping. Stories seem too disjointed; could tell that there were two different writers. I wondered if it was even the same story. I figured it might be a &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; type breakout but was sadly disappointed.	2001-01-30

I felt that the story was not completed and that the end was the way it was only for a sequel. I did read the end 3 times to decide whether it made sense or not. While I thought the identity of the killer was obvious, the end still bothered me. What bothered me more was the wasted pages of blank paper. It did appear that the author was trying to fill pages. Also, the illness of the daughter didn't seem to fit into the story at all. All that said, I'll probably still read the sequel, yet maybe I'll get it from the library instead of buying the book.	2001-01-02
