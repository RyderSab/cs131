The author does not condemn previous generations for eating meat, and is respectful of the kosher slaughtering process (shechitah) as it was practiced for many generations.  However, she also feels that, in the light of the cruelty of modern factory farms, it is no longer enough to focus only on the moment of slaughter.  Shechitah itself is humane, but the ways in which the animals are raised and transported to the meat processing plant are not.  Kosher and non-kosher meat come from the same commercial sources, and the animals are all raised the same way.  \\"The distinction between kosher and non-kosher meat, \\"she writes, \\"is made at the ramp to the slaughtering house.\\"<br /><br />In chapter 2, \\"From living soul to animal machine,\\" Kalechofsky traces the philosophical developments that have led to the Western acceptance of the cruelties of modern factory farms.  Most enlightening to me was the section discussing the influence of the (gentile) French philosopher, Renee Descartes.  Best known for \\"I think, therefore I am,\\" Descarte also thought than animals were like machines (automata) and do not feel pain or emotional stress.  As a mathematician, Descartes saw everything in terms of what could be counted and measured in the physical world.  Subjective experiences such as animal suffering were, to him, of no account whatsoever.<br /><br />This chapter was an eye-opener for me, because I had not studied Descarte's philosophy in any depth before.  As far as I knew, he played no role whatsoever in Jewish life.  Wrong.  Although most religious Jews do not study Descartes, the civilization we live in has been strongly influenced by him.  When it comes to animals, many Jews are de facto Cartesians, even if they have never heard of Descartes.<br /><br />Kalechofsky traces the line from Descartes to factory farms, which tend to regard animals as little more than egg-milk-meat producing machines.  She also cites references to demonstrate that this attitude is NOT acceptable in classical Jewish thought.  \\"Either animals are part of God's creation or they are not,\\" she writes, \\"and if not, Genesis is false.  The antithesis, foreseen in the 17th century, has come to its final crisis: You cannot support the Cartesian view of animal life and the biblical view at the same time.\\"  (Page 35)<br /><br />Because the kosher food industry is so firmly emmeshed in the modern factory farm system, it is next to impossible to find kosher meat from animals that have not been badly mistreated in the name of \\"progress.\\"  That alone should lead a sensitive Jew to give up eating meat.  But there are other reasons, too -- reasons of health, economics, and social responsibility.  These the author fully explores.  She also points out that a vegetarian diet bridges the gap between Jews who keep kosher and those who don't.  Many synagogues and other Jewish organizations have begun serving vegetarian meals for precisely this reason.  If the purpose of kashrut is to respect life and unite the Jewish people, then vegetarianism is the best way to do this in the 21st century.<br /><br />I also recommend [[ASIN:1930051247 Judaism and Vegetarianism]] by Richard.

The paintings and sketches are arranged in chronological order, with personal explanations of each work.  The result is like a scrapbook.  Whereas most people today would have an album of photographs, Toby Fluek lost everything in the Holocaust, and was forced to carry her memories in her mind.  Years later, she committed them to paper and canvas and now shares them in this book.<br /><br />Interestingly, her family lived on a farm.  One does not usually think of Eastern European Jews as farmers, but, in fact, there were Jews who worked the land. (One of my gentile Polish neighbors here in Minnesota told me that the Jews in his village always had the best vegetables!)  While it is true that there were restrictions against Jews owning land, it is also true that there were exceptions to the rules.  Toby's father's family had been on this farm for generations.  It was this aspect that led me to purchase the book, because I, too, live and work on the land.<br /><br />\\"We led a primitive life,\\" she writes, \\"but we were a close-knit family.\\"  The \\"primitive\\" side of life is illustrated in her excellent still lifes, which portray arrangements of the common objects used for the Sabbath, festivals, and everyday activities.  A basket of eggs for Passover, candles for the Sabbath, a prayer shawl on the table.  Meat was served only on the Sabbath or when her father had an animal slaughtered.  (Even then, he sold the best cuts of meat.)  On weekdays they ate lots of potatoes, beans, and vegetables -- all beautifully painted here.  Pots and dishes were passed down from mother to daughter, and nothing was ever discarded.  One still life shows a well-worn set of Passover pots stored in a niche in the wall.  Another painting is of her mother working in the farmhouse kitchen.  She in kneading a week's worth of bread dough in a large wooden tub.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we learn that Toby eventually lost everything to the Nazi occupation.  This, too, is illustrated through her paintings and drawings.  The style here is darker, more ominous.  Not something I would hang on my wall (the burning hospital, with the people still in it, is utterly horrifying in its simplicity) but essential to the telling of her story.  She shows us Yom Kippur in the forest, hiding outdoors in the rain, crouching in a cellar and hanging her bread on a string to keep the mice from eating it at night.  Her father was shot by the Nazis, her brother captured and taken away, presumably to his death.  Through it all, her will to live was strong and she survived.<br /><br />The collection of paintings (94 in all) continues through the liberation of Poland, being a displaced person begging for food, finding a job in a Russian military bakery (where the soldiers looked the other way so she could steal bread to take home).  In 1949 she was married and moved to New York, where she lives today.  The world she once knew is gone, but the memory lives on in her artwork.

Back in 1972-73, he sat on a bench on the corner of 86th Street and Central Park West, every day, rain or shine, meditiating in total silence.  It is said that he radiated an aura of peace and tranquility.  Certainly he attracted quite a following.  People of all walks of life came to sit in his presence.  He was written up by the New York Times and other publications.  He was occasionally mentioned in New Age books on meditation and spirtuality.  But who was he?  And where is he now?<br /><br />His name is Gil Locks, and he is now a Hasidic Jew who lives in Jerusalem.  He spends a lot of his time at the Western Wall, encouraging fellow Jews to put on tefillin (phylacteries) and get in touch with their own Jewish roots.  But he doesn't cram the Torah down their throats like some rabbis do.  Rather, he listens compassionately to their questions and spiritual struggles, because he, too, has been there.  This book is his autobiography -- a very honest, often amusing account of how he traveled to India, lived on ashrams, meditated with various gurus, returned to the USA, traveled around the country in an old bus with \\"Yea God\\" painted on it, was guided to sit in Central Park, later tried and rejected the \\"Jesus trip\\"... and eventually found authentic spirituality in Hasidic/kabbalistic Judaism.<br /><br />Parts of the book are hysterically funny.  When, on the beach in Hawaii, he suddenly decides to become an observant Jew, he jumps in head first -- but has no local rabbi to guide him as to how things should be done.  When he reads in the Bible that Jews should tie \\"tassels\\" on the corners of their garments, he takes that quite literally -- and ties a yarn tassel on every single corner of every garment he owns -- one on each point of his shirt collars, two on each shirt sleeve where the cuffs button, etc.  \\"I looked like I was wearing a couch cover,\\" he reminisces on page 159.  Then he reads that one should tithe one's money and \\"bind it to your hand\\" (meaning don't spend it) and take it to Jerusalem for the widows, orphans, and poor.  He misinterprets this verse, too.  He literally ties the money to his hand with a piece of yarn, then gets on a plane and heads for Jerusalem.<br /><br />Arriving in Israel, he goes to the Western Wall.  There he soon finds out that his silly-looking yarn tassels are not kosher at all (the real tassels, called tzitzit, are only tied on special four-cornered garments!)  He then prays at the Wall for God to send him a holy person to show him the right way.  Immediately a young man walks up to him and asks if he wants to put on tefillin.  Within 45 minutes Gil Locks goes from looking like a beach bum to looking like a yeshiva student.  That was 1977.<br /><br />Like everything else he did in his life, Gil threw himself completely into the yeshiva world.  But he also maintained the spirituality which sent him on his quest in the first place.  This is the story of a genuinely God-intoxicated man.  One gets the impression that, even as an Orthodox Jew today, he is still something of a local \\"character.\\"  The book is filled with amazing stories and anecdotes that will make you laugh, cry, shake your head in wonderment.  Whether you are Jewish or not, whether you are a \\"religious Jew\\" or not, this book will speak to your heart and soul.

Back in high school (a LONG time ago) I dabbled in guitar, but haven't touched one in decades.  I've been seriously thinking about taking up this instrument again when, lo and behold, a review copy of \\"Maran's Illustrated Guitar\\" showed up in my mailbox -- probably because I've reviewed other books with creative graphics layouts.  It certainly wasn't because of any expertise on the guitar!  But God works in strange ways, they say...<br /><br />This book is absolutely the best beginner's guide I've seen, and the one I'm actually using to learn the guitar.  It covers everything from the history of the guitar, famous guitarists, types of guitars (classical, acoustic, electric), how to buy, clean, repair, change strings, perform adjustments and maintenance -- and of course, how to play it.  Not only does this book have the usual chord charts, it has actual photos showing how to place the fingers on the frets.  And it doesn't just cover basic chords.  It also includes a section on reading music and playing single notes -- something I did not find in other beginner's books.  After learning the basics, you can turn to specific chapters for pointers on Rock, Blues, Country, Folk, or Classical guitar, with different picking and strumming styles clearly explained.  (For each section, the model holding the guitar is dressed appropriately for the genre -- a nice touch!)  There is also a chapter on amplifers and other equipment for electric guitar players, and a section on setting up a home recording studio.<br /><br />One of the best things I learned is that there are now electronic tuners for guitars (and most other instruments) -- something that did not exist in my high school days.  I immediately bought one. As with everything else in this book, there was a clear description of the types of tuners, the pros and cons of each, etc., complete with photos.<br /><br />The graphical layout is very well done and pleasing to the eye.  The photos are interspersed with the text to get away from the boring \\"Gutenberg box\\" effect.  Another plus is that the binding is flexible enough for the book to lay flat while playing -- a major convenience when both of your hands are busy holding the guitar.  In short, this is a beautiful book and a pleasure to use.  Highly recommended!away from the boring \\"Gutenberg box\\" effect.

US	52499409	R29WNENPZ4HJCV	0449211479	241253921	The Source	Books	3	53	83	N	N	I liked it better 40 years ago....	This book first came out in 1965, the year I graduated from high school.  As a college freshman I loved it, mostly because of a budding interest in archaeology.  The idea of going back and forth between a dig in Israel, where various items were discovered, to the time periods when those artifacts got there, was clever and original.  Had I been reviewing the book back then, I would have given it five stars.<br /><br />As an over-50 Orthodox Jew re-reading it today, however, I have serious second thoughts -- hence the three stars.  I still loved the first half of the book, where he portrays the paleolithic origins of the site, the villages that were there during the Iron and Bronze Ages, etc.  The chapter \\"Of Death and Life\\" was especially good, showing what things must have been like in the days when pagans sacrificed their children to idols and slept with cult prostitutes to (they believed) make the crops grow.  This was certainly not the idylic \\"Mother-Goddess\\" religion that modern feminists imagine.  Appropriately, it is a woman in the story who realizes that these fertility rites are useless for producing pregnancy.<br /><br />\\"The Source\\" is an interesting romp through history but, even in the early chapters, there are some odd details that don't ring true.  For example, the main character in the Stone Age chapter, \\"The Bee Eater,\\" is named \\"Ur.\\"  Now, \\"Ur\\" as a German prefix means \\"ancestral\\" or \\"primeval\\" (as in \\" Urwald\\" -- the \\"virgin forest\\"). The implication is that caveman Ur is the Ur-father of a family line that will be traced throughout the book.  Only problem is, why would a Semitic character have a Germanic name?  Are we to assume he had migrated to the cave from Europe?  Not likely.  Or was this supposed to be a play on the Hebrew word \\"Ohr\\" for \\"Light?\\"  Or does it refer the biblical city of Ur, whose name also means \\"light\\"?  Somehow I don't think so...<br /><br />Not only is Ur's name Germanic, he also has blue eyes, and this characteristic carries down through the family line for the entire book.  What is this fascination with blue-eyed Semites, some of whom even have light hair?  Was Michener basing them on medieval portraits of Jesus, looking for a reason to keep the fair-haired image of the Christian god?  Or was this just a tacky literary device so we could recognize members of the House of Ur in each chapter?  If that's the case, then it's not very accurate, because blue eyes are genetically recessive.  Since the Ur folks repeatedly intermarried with dark-eyed spouses down through the centuries, the blue eyes would not have bred true, unless they married another person who carried the recessive gene.  And then only 25% of the time.<br /><br />Anothe annoyance is that, once Michener got past the rise of Christianity, he turned sour on Judaism.  Oh, he liked jolly old rabbi Zaki (a stereotypical \\"fat Jew\\" with a \\"good sense of humor\\") in 16th-century Safed.  And he does accurately portray the Church's persecution of Jews during the Inquisition.  But beyond that, he saw Judaism only in terms of \\"The Law\\" (why in the heck didn't he call it \\"The Torah\\"?) and portrayed it as little more than unbending rigidity and pettiness.  At one point, the Irish Catholic archaeologist, Cullinane, sums it up this way:  Judaism is like an old, knarled olive tree, rotten and hollow in the middle, but with one vibrant, flowering branch -- Christianity!  Sorry, folks, but that's NOT how I think of my religion.<br /><br />Even worse was the chapter, \\"Rebbe Itzik and the Sabra,\\" which takes place during the founding of Israel in 1948.  Rebbe Itzik (and Orthodox Jews in general) are portrayed in a totally negative light, as nothing but outdated parasites who live off charity and won't fight for the new State.  Clearly, Michener was listening to Zionist propaganda here.  The early Zionists did indeed hold traditional Judaism in contempt, but there was another side to it.  Beyond the supposed \\"rigidity\\" was/is the joy of the Sabbath, the holy days, the caring for each other, the closeness of the family and community, etc.  Michener never grasped any of this.  He saw only the \\"outdatedness\\" because, in his gentile mind, Orthodox Judaism was nothing but an old hollow tree that would be better off dead.<br /><br />Michener's theology seems to be that all of religion is made-up fantasy anyway, and the only thing that really matters is a (pagan?) relationship to the land.  As a Palestinian descendant of Ur says on page 1080:<br /><br />\\"I belong to the land, this well, these olive trees.  My people were here before yours were formed.  When it was prudent to be Canaanites, we were Canaanites.  For the same lofty reason we were Phoenicians and when Jews ruled the land we were Jews, or Greeks, or Romans, or Christians, or Arabs, or Mamelukes or Turks.  If you allowed us to hold the land we never gave a damn as to which church we worshipped in or which flag we saluted...\\"<br /><br />The one good thing I can say about the last chapters of the book is that they clearly show how the modern Israelis rejected the basically pacifist rabbinic form of Judaism and embraced their military-oriented culture of today.  The assumption back then was, that Judaism as a religion would die out, to be replaced by the new secular Israeli nationalism.  That didn't happen entirely.  Yes, the majority of Israelis today are secularists. But there is also a vibrant rebirth of religious Judaism in both the Israel and the Diaspora.  Michener could not have foreseen the revival and renewal movements that would appear during the 1970s and 80s, resulting in the still-growing Hasidic and Orthodox communities of today.  Not to mention the Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist movements.<br /><br />For this reason, \\"The Source\\" is now badly outdated -- unless we consider the possibility of a sequel:  Somewhere on the planet Earth, a blue-eyed descendant of the House of Ur is celebrating the Sabbath with the Hasidim, joyfully singing songs and telling stories that will live on into the future, perhaps even, someday, be carried to distant planets in an ever-expanding universe.of the Sabbath, the holy days, the caring for each other, the closeness of the family and community, etc.  Michener never grasped any of this.

US	52499409	R12UITIEKAMSA1	0670888729	932731966	The Turkey Prince	Books	5	4	4	N	N	An entertaining  re-retelling of an old Breslov tale	According to the inner flap of this children's book, the story of \\"The Turkey Prince\\" is based on \\"an old Hasidic tale\\" but gives no other source info.  However, the tale does have a known author:  Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, known as the Breslover Rebbe, who first told it to his disciples in the early 1800s.  It was later published in a collection edited by his chief disciple, Reb Noson of Nemirov, and can be found in English translation in \\"Rabbi Nachman's Stories\\" by Aryeh Kaplan (see pp. 479-480).<br /><br />The tale itself is in the common domain, and appears in a number of other collections as \\"The Rooster Prince.\\" (There is some debate as to exactly which barnyard bird \\"truthahn\\" originally referred to in Yiddish.) When I was a child I heard it told as \\"The Rooster Prince,\\" and thought of the prince as being \\"chicken.\\"  The switch to \\"turkey\\" is more recent and might be because of modern English slang.  In this book, the prince \\"knew he was a turkey\\" in the sense that he did not feel competent to one day become king and lead the people like his father did.<br /><br />Like many classic fairy tales, the original version of the Turkey Prince was not intended to be a children's story.  It was a parable that Rebbe Nachman told to his disciples about how to bring non-religious Jews back to Judaism, and/or how to become more Torah-observant onesself.  A Jew who has left Judaism has forgotten who he truly is and, like the Prince, is sitting \\"naked\\" -- without the proper \\"garments\\" to clothe the  soul.  In recent years, Rabbi Avraham Greenbaum wrote an entire Hasidic self-help book based on this story, entitled \\"Under the Table and How to Get Up\\" (available here on Amazon.)<br /><br />The original is quite short (only a page or so) and the prince is already crazy at the beginning of the tale.  In this book, we go back and learn that this happened because he got stage fright at a royal banquet.  This is followed by a detailed description (with cute illustrations) of how he took off his clothes.  In the original, he sits stark naked under the table, but here he keeps his shorts on, which makes it appropriate for everyone in terms of modesty.  After that, the book follows the original pretty closely, right down to the dialogue about how a turkey can wear clothes, eat good food, etc.<br /><br />As in the original, various people come to the palace and try to cure the Turkey Prince.  In the illustrations here, they are dressed in all sorts of costumes and silly hats, presumably to tempt him to wear clothes.  But only the \\"unknown healer\\" knows the secret cure -- to pretend that he, too, is a turkey, make friends with the prince, and convince him that a turkey can do everything a normal person does.  The original story ends here, but this book adds a follow-up about what happened to the prince when he grew up.<br /><br />The School Library Journal review rather disparagingly called this a \\"psychological\\" story about \\"self-esteem\\", with a \\"psychiatric\\" cure that \\"may appeal more to adults who espouse its values than to children\\" (word in quotes are the Journal reviewer's).  I disagree.  This negative opinion is based more on the description from the inside flap (presumably aimed at parents who buy the book) than the story itself, which is no more \\"psychiatric\\" than any other parable.  Hasidic children and adults were enjoying this story long before Sigmund Freud.  Like many fairy tales, it is a teaching story with a moral, true.  But it is also great fun, with just the right amount of silliness to get the point across without being preachy.  And, like any good parable, it is a story that grows deeper with every telling.  As a child I loved this story.  As an adult Breslover Hasid, I thoroughly enjoyed this version.  I recommend it to Hasidim and non-Hasidim alike.s) of how he took off his clothes.

(Why is it that SF writers always have to send the Jews back into the  past?  Don't they think we will have a future?)  Yes, there is an aspect of that here, but it's much, much more.  The focus is not so much on JEWISH history as it is on RUSSIAN history, although Jewishness does play an important part.<br /><br />The year is 1975, the place is Soviet Russia. Young Ivan \\"Vanya\\" Smetski finds out he is Jewish when his father decides to claim his Jewish heritage in order to emigrate to Israel and then, hopefully, to the United States.  Politically, it is a time when America is putting pressure on the USSR to release more Soviet Jews, but the Soviets react the other way and clamp down on letting Russian Jews leave.  The result is that Ivan's father loses his university position, the Smetskis lose their  apartment, and the family ends up living with a cousin named Marek on a little farm near Kiev.  At this point, little Vanya is 10 years old.<br /><br />One day, while out in the woods by the farm, Vanya discovers a clearing with a strange round pit full of leaves.  Something is moving in the pit -- a monster?  The leaves rustle away and he thinks he sees a woman's face rising up among the leaves.  He runs away in terror, but never forgets that place, although he thinks of it as some sort of nightmare or hallucination.<br /><br />Years later, the Smetskis are living in America, and Vanya, now calling himself \\"Ivan\\" with the English pronunciation, is working on his Ph.D. thesis about ancient Russian fairy tales.  He returns to the part of Russia where he grew up (now part of the Ukrainian Republic) and eventually finds that same clearing in the forest.  There is indeed a woman asleep on a pedestal in the middle of the pit -- and a huge enchanted bear is guarding her.  Sleeping Beauty is real...  Only it's not quite \\"happily ever after.\\"  After kissing the princess, he must agree to marry her in order to get past the bear -- or be killed by it.  He proposes and she accepts.  He then follows her over a magical bridge into 10th-century Russia -- and into a major a culture shock.  Suddenly he is in a barbaric world where literacy and scholarship count for next to nothing, and he is considered a useless weakling because he cannot wield a sword or battle axe.  From then on, the real adventure begins...<br /><br />The book is a convincing mix of realism and magical fantasy that is based on serious historical research, but one thing did bother me in the beginning of the book.  There is a rather strange scene where, after Professor Smetski decides to be openly Jewish, he has a mohel (ritual circumciser) come to the house to circumcise him and 10-year-old Ivan.  Now, I do know that most Russiam Jews of that era were not circumcised because the Soviet government forbade it.  I also know that, after emigration from Russia, many such Jews did have themselves circumcised as an affirtmation of their Jewishness.  But I have not heard that they were doing it in a home operation in Russia.  For adults, this operation is painful and dangerous and usually requires an overnight stay in the hospital.  Plus, it was ILLEGAL in the Soviet Union and regarded as \\"practicing medicine without a license.\\" So nu, would a mohel risk imprisonment to do it like that?  I'm not saying is NEVER happened, but I found the focus on circumcision somewhat disconcerting.  Ivan's circumcision does play a part in the plot, however, so it could be taken as a literary device.<br /><br />The use of Russian fairy tales was interesting and believable.  I was already familiar with the stories of Baba Yaga the wicked witch, but I did not know of the significance of the Bear in Russian folklore until I read this book.  The story is taking place right at the time when Christianity is first reaching the area, and thepeople have not really given up their pagan beliefs.  Magic still works because people believe in it, and the evil powers of Baba Yaga are very, very real.  But so are the powers for good -- and they are not always coming from the Christian side, either.  There's even a Jewish \\"good witch\\" who helps defeat Baba Yaga -- but more than that would be a spoiler.area, and the people have not really given up their pagan beliefs.

But since there really aren't too many other rituals associated with this holiday, the focus on tree-planting is appropriate.  Sammy Spider watches his human neighbors, the Shapiros, celebrate with fruit and nuts (eating (a tradition for this holiday) and by planting a sapling (also traditional).  The colorful paper-cut illustrations the follow the Tree through the seasons, showing the leaves change color, etc.,  as the Shapiros care for their yard.  As a secular  presentation of nature with a Jewsih twist, it's a nice book.	2005-03-18

Regarding the debate here about whether Yentl was a feminist or a transsexual, I weigh in on the transgender side -- for all the reasons other reviewers have already listed here, and which I have also discussed on my Hasidism FAQ website.  So I won't reinvent the wheel in this review.  I agree that the movie was definitely a feminist statement, but the book, well, that's another story altogether.<br /><br />We should remember that before the movie, there was the stage play.  It followed the book pretty closely, (which the movie did not!) and was very popular in lesbian and avant garde theaters.  When I saw the play performed in the 1970s, Yentl was played as the Jewish version of a \\"butch\\" lesbian.  (In terms of social roles, not machismo.  The ideal  Jewish male in the timeframe of this story was a scholar, not a redneck.)  In the play, like in the book, Yentl remains living as the man Anshel in Eastern Europe.  In the movie, Streisand changed this very important point and had Yentl revert to wearing women's clothes and then going to America.<br /><br />So nu, what was the relationship between Yentl/Anshel and Avigdor?  They were study partners -- chaverim in Hebrew -- a relationship that doesn't seem to exist outside of the Orthodox Jewish community, so here's some background.  The Talmud is written in dialogue mode with different rabbis agreeing and disagreeing on various points of Jewish law and theology.  Talmud is traditionally studied out loud, by two people hotly debating, going point-by-point over the discussions on the page together.  In the traditional yeshiva world -- even today -- the schools are not co-ed.  So naturally, your study partner is going to be the same sex as yourself.  And very often, your study partner is also your very best friend.  You not only sit together in school, you confide in each other, hang out together, encourage each other in life's struggles, etc.  And this can be a very close relationship.  But it's not sexual.  It's male bonding.  If Anshel had joined the army, then he and Avigdor would have been \\"buddies\\" who fought battles together.<br /><br />Anshel loves Avigdor, yes.  But as a study partner, not a lover.  What Anshel misses in Avigdor when he changes study halls is not sexual attraction, it's their learning together.  Nobody else in the yeshiva is as serious or as brilliant a student as Avigdor.  Nobody else is an intellectual match for Anshel -- and so, he studies alone.<br /><br />When Anshel reveals to Avigdor that s/he is really the woman Yentl, Avigdor suggests that they could get married and still study together -- but Yentl/Anshel says no.  S/he tells him that s/he is \\"neither one [sex] nor the other\\" and that s/he has \\"the soul of a man in the body of a woman.\\"  This teaches us that Yentl DID INDEED have a gender identity crisis.  If she had just wanted to study Talmud, if she were in love with Avigdor, she could have married him and that would be that.  But she chose instead to remain living as Anshel for the rest of her life, even without Avigdor.  In other words, she chose loneliness and loss of friendship over going back to living as a woman -- a choice that many a real transsexual has also made.<br /><br />Now, one issue that has not come up yet in the debate here is this:  What exactly did I.B. Singer mean by \\"the SOUL of a man in the body of a woman?\\"  Is this used figuratively, i.e., with \\"soul\\" meaning interests, ideas, disposition?  Or did Singer mean it literally -- that the eternal soul of Yentl was male, trapped in a female body?  If it was figurative, then why does Yentl's father explain it by telling her \\"even heaven makes mistakes?\\"  I think it is meant literally -- that a male soul has incarnated in the female body named Yentl.  Perhaps it was reincarnation (Singer did believe in that.) This was/is one explanation in kabbalah (Jewish mysticm) for what we now call, in scientific terms, \\"gender dysphoria.\\"<br /><br />When Singer was writing in the 1960s, \\"gender dysphoria\\" was assumed to be caused by a mismatch of social roles, such as a girl being raised as a tomboy.  And that's how Singer portrayed Yentl, with her father teaching her \\"male\\" things.  But even today, when women are free (in Western countries at least) to openly pursue any type of studies or career or lifestyle they want, there are STILL female-to-male (FTM) transsexuals who claim to have male souls trapped in female bodies.  Many of them were NOT raised as tomboys, either.  The issue for them is not social roles, it's gender identity.<br /><br />Recent research seems to indicate that this inner conflict is caused by a difference in brain structure.  (Nature, not nurture.)  Apparently, there is a part of the brain that is hard-wired to \\"feel\\" male or female -- and if this is out of sync with the rest of the body, you have a transgendered person.  Had Singer known this in his day, he might have focused less on Yentl's dislike of sewing and cooking (the so-called \\"women's work\\"), and more on her inner identity crisis about feeling male.  But he was a man of his times and he used the literary devices available then.  When he wrote this story in 1962, DNA had not even been discovered, and there were no MRI machines to map the activities of the living brain.  He assumed (wrongly) that a Yentl became what s/he was because of how she was raised.  21st-century readers need to keep this in mind when they read this story.ender dysphoria\\" was assumed to be caused by a mismatch of social roles, such as a girl being raised as a tomboy.

US	52499409	R1UMI4M28OPPWX	0345430379	835598939	Dante's Equation	Books	4	33	37	N	N	Jewish mysticism (kabbalah) meets modern physics	I read this book because I am compiling a list of Jewish science fiction and fantasy (see my Trekmania list on that.)  Frankly, I expected this to be one of those neo-pagan pulp-fiction things that I call \\"junk kabbalah.\\"  I was pleasantly surprised.  The kabbalah parts are reasonably accurate (although a little too dependent on \\"The Bible Code\\" idea for my tastes), and the way in which the author combines them with concepts in modern physics is fascinating and accurate, at least as far as I can tell.  (I know more about kabbalah than physics.)  The author explains both the kabbalah and physics theories clearly, although it does help to have a detail-oriented mind.  (Think \\"Michael Crichton\\" in this area.)<br /><br />The basic idea of the book is that there are multiple planets and universes, each with its own proportion of Good and Evil.  Earth is a world where Good and Evil are 50/50, but in other worlds, the proportions might be 30/70 or 60/40 or whatever, and this affects both the physical surroundings and the beings that live on those worlds.  (Hence the reference to Dante, whose \\"Inferno\\" described a multi-layered \\"Hell\\" with different types of \\"worlds\\" suited to different sins.  In \\"Dante's Equation,\\" there are various types of \\"heavens\\" as well.)<br /><br />The alternate worlds can be accessed through a mini-wormhole that exists just outside the fence around Auschwitz.  During the Holocaust, a rabbi vanished there in plain sight of credible witnesses.  Now both the mystics and the scientists are trying to find that extrance again.  But the problem with this wormhole is that \\"like attracts like\\" and you end up in the world that is most similar to your own vibrations (or level of consciousness or whatever.)<br /><br />\\"Dante's Equation\\" is the formula that not only predicts these proportions of Good and Evil but, with the right (?) laboratory equipment, the formula can actually ALTER the tendencies toward Good or Evil in a given area right here on Earth.  Physicist Jill Talcott discovers this formula and creates the effect on a limited basis in her laboratory.  Powerful stuff -- but is this a good idea?  What if the military turns it into a weapon?<br /><br />More than that would be a spoiler, except to say that that the book is well-plotted with lots of twists and turns.  My one gripe is that the Orthodox rabbi character, Aharon Handalman, is the type of rigid stereotype that is becoming all-too-common in modern fiction these days.  And not very accurate, either.  The idea that Handalman would not let his wife even look at the printouts from his Bible Code arrays because they are \\"Torah\\" is utterly ridiculous.  Where did the author get this absurd idea -- from watching \\"Yentl\\"?  In real life, there would be no reason why his wife could not help him look for patterns in a computer printout.  And she probably would.  Ditto for going to the Yad VaShem library to do research.  One could not even claim this was \\"Torah\\" -- it was \\"secular\\" scholarship about the Holocaust -- and there are plenty of Orthodox women who do Holocaust research.  There is simply NO REASON why she would have to sneak there as she does in the book, except as a rather lame literary device to advance the plot.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the various characters are archetypes of personality traits, and each is out of balance in different ways.  OK, I can buy that -- but why, Oh why, must my culture always be used to represent the attribute of rigidity?  Not only ONE rabbi, but TWO end up on the \\"fundamentalist\\" planet -- in a culture that is more like the Spanish Inquisition than anything Jewish.  Was this author even aware that the Inquisition was not a Jewish phenomenon, that Jews do not burn and torture heretics, that the Jews themselves were often the heretics BEING burned?  Or is the author projecting \\"Old Testament\\" Christian theological stereotypes onto the Jews?  At any rate, this part of the book did not ring true to me.<br /><br />Later in the book, when Rabbi Handalman shaves his beard in order to disguise himself (for reasons I won't give away here), I could go along with that in a life-and-death situation.  It is a standard axiom of Torah that most ritual laws may be set aside temporarily to save a life.  But the implication was that he stayed shaved after the emergency was over, i.e., that in order to find \\"love\\" and \\"gentleness\\" he had to cease being Orthodox.  For that I dock this book a star.  It is perfectly possible to be BOTH an Orthodox Jew AND a compassionate human being -- the two are NOT mutually exclusive!  I really wish more novelists would realize that.  Still, the book was a good read if you can overlook these stereotypes.rue to me. <br /> <br />Later in the book, when Rabbi Handalman shaves his beard in order to disguise himself (for reasons I won't give away here), I could go along with that in a life-and-death situation.

US	52499409	R3HAT9SSJ2LQEQ	0446403229	994732114	Zaddik	Books	4	23	23	N	N	From New York reality to stetl mysticism -- and back again	This novel starts out as a typical cop story, with the gruesome ritual murder of a Hasidic diamond dealer and his secretary in New York City.  The official detective on the scene is a clueless and rather antisemitic gentile who is not likely to ever solve the murders -- and the Hasidim know this.  So they hire David Taylor, a Jewish ex-cop who has been studying Hasidism with a Lubovitcher rabbi in an attempt to find his roots.  He's not a pious Jew by any means, but he does know enough about the Hasidic culture to open doors that would be closed to the gentile cop.<br /><br />The motive for the murders is a flawless 72-carat diamond -- a magnificent stone that nobody in the diamond business has even seen, but which definitely exists.  It belongs to the Satmarer Rebbe, a Hasidic leader who was planning to include it in his daughter's dowry.  She is betrothed to the adopted son of the Lubavitcher Rebbe. (A fictional character -- there is no such son.  The surname of the Rebbe, \\"Seligman,\\" is also fictional.  The real Lubovitcher's name was Schneerson.)  This is a highly controversial marriage between two powerful warring sects, and there are plenty of people -- mafia, Israeli agents, ex-Nazis, ex-KGBs, greedy dealers, a murderous psychopath -- who want to stop this alliance and/or get their hands on that valuable diamond.<br /><br />That's the hard-boiled cop part.  As the story develops, an element of magical realism enters the picture.  The murdered man was a Satmarer, and Taylor must meet with the Satmarer Rebbe and receive his blessing if he is to get any information out of the community.  What follows is a very strange interview.  The Rebbe refuses to talk directly to Taylor because he is a sinner, and speaks, instead, to David's saintly ancestor, Reb Hirsh Leib.  Is this the bigotry of a mad religious fanatic -- or is the Rebbe REALLY speaking to the soul of Taylor's great-great-great grandfather?  From this point on, mysticism becomes entwined with realism.  The point is repeatedly made that \\"There is no before or after in Torah.\\"  In the mind of God, past and present are intertwined.<br /><br />In Part Two of the novel, Taylor is transported in a vision to Hirsh Leib's world in 18th-century Eastern Europe, where we learn the origins of the diamond, it's connection to Taylor's ancestor, Hirsh Leib -- and a lot of other things I won't tell you about now.  This knowledge, in turn helps Taylor solve the murders in Part Three -- and much more.<br /><br />The book is well-written and tightly plotted, with plenty of twists and turns that will keep you reading far into the night.  However, there were too many graphic scenes (definitely X-rated) and some bloopers about Hasidic culture, which is why I am docking it a star.  Most of the bloopers were relatively minor, but still... (Writers of this kind of novel really should hire a Hasidic copy editor.  The publishers' editors seem to be generally clueless and just don't catch the errors.)<br /><br />One of the more baffling bloopers was the statement that Hasidim do not consult doctors.  Not true.  Even weirder is that the family involved (who were childless but would not see a fertility specialist) are supposed to be Lubovitchers, the most \\"modern\\" of all the Hasidim.  In real life, the Lubovitcher Rebbe was very interested in medical advances and often referred his followers to specialists, ESPECIALLY for fertility issues.  My guess is, regarding this blooper, that the author read old accounts of how Rebbe Nachman of Breslov discouraged his Hasidim from seeing doctors. True.  But Rebbe Nachman was writing in the 18th century -- at a time when doctors did not even wash their hands before surgery.  In those days, hospitals were places where people went to die.  Nowadays, Breslover Hasidim (and others) do consult doctors, although they also stress that all healing ultimately comes from God.<br /><br />A few other bloopers were: (1) Reb Teitel's four kitchens for \\"Meat, dairy, Shabbos, and Passover.\\"  There would be no reason to have a separate kitchen for Shabbos (the Sabbath.)  If he did have four kitchens, they would be \\"meat\\" and \\"dairy\\"  for Passover, and \\"meat\\" and \\"dairy\\" for the rest of the year.  (2) the big-screen TV that the Lubovitchers set up outside their headquarters on Simchas Torah.  This would be a no-no on that holiday, because electronic equipment such as TVs and cameras cannot be operated on the holy days.  The author must have confused Simchat Torah with Saturday night after the Sabbath, when the Lubovitcher Rebbe did broadcast his sermons on satellite TV.  (3) Wishing each other \\"gut yontif\\" before the Sabbath.  The correct phrase is \\"gut Shabbos.\\" (4) Using \\"Reb\\" as a stand-alone noun.  \\"Reb\\" is a title that ALWAYS goes with a name -- one does not say \\"The Reb said,\\" anymore than one says \\"the Mr. said.\\"  And \\"Reb\\" is NOT synonymous with Rebbe.  A Rebbe is the leader of a Hasidic sect.  \\"Reb\\" is a Yiddish honorific that can be applied to any male Jew as a sign of respect -- rather like saying \\"sir\\" to a superior.<br /><br />In spite of these bloopers, the author did do his homework and even included a glossary of Hebrew and Yiddish terms for the uninitiated.  The characters in the flashback section are all based on historical figures, with the exception of Hirsch Leib, who is, in the author's words, \\"a composite figure based on several Hasidic masters.\\", dairy, Shabbos, and Passover.\\"   There would be no reason to have a separate kitchen for Shabbos (the Sabbath.)

This book was hailed in Jewish circles as the first Star Trek novel with a Jewish character.  That's not exactly true, as I have demonstrated in my Trekmania list of \\"Star Trek novels with (maybe) Jewish characters.\\"  But it is the first novel with a MAJOR character who is Jewish.  True, Captain David Rabin never actually SAYS he's Jewish, but on page 1 he is described as a man \\"of Earth Israeli descent\\" who grew up in the Negev, and he has Hebrew inscriptions on his walls.  So nu --what else can he be?  There are other broad hints, too, such as the use of \\"Shalom\\" as a greeting, and a discussion about \\"Never again\\" to explain why Israelis are not pacifists.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the book, but there were a few things that really annoyed me, which is why I docked it a star.  First of all was Rabin's constant wisecracking.  Why, oh why, does every Jewish character have to be a comedian?  For Jews to have \\"a good sense of humor\\" is as stereotyped as blacks having \\"a sense of rhythm.\\"  (This problem is not limited to this book.  Whenever I mention my own research into Jewish themes in Star Trek, people invariably laugh.  Would they laugh if I were researching African or Asian characters in Trekdom?)<br /><br />My second annoyance was the idea that Spock had learned how to to \\"deadpan\\" jokes from Rabin in his youth.  I have never seen Spock as a jokester.  True, there is humor in the scripts, but this is from the POV of the audience, not Spock himself.  We might laugh at Spock's literal interpretations of idioms and metaphors, but it is out of character for a Vulcan to be actually cracking jokes -- especially a young half-Vulcan who is trying so hard to fit into the Vulcan way.<br /><br />Lastly, I found the constant references to \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" rather strained.  I realize this was an attempt to include Arabs along with the Israelis, but surely there is a better way to do this that by citing old movies.  Would people in the 23rd century really pick up on obscure references such as \\"Aqaba by land\\"?  And how do Arab readers feel about using a movie to define their culture?  I would certainly be offended if a writer used \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\" to define Judaism.<br /><br />In spite of these nits, I did enjoy the story.  It provided some interesting background about why Spock chose to go into Starfleet, and some good conversations about war and peace.  The characters were well-developed and the writing was excellent, especially for a first Trek novel.

Most of these stories are not SF, they are fantasy tales based on themes from Jewish mysticism.  (I am using as my criteria the usual expectation that science fiction has some element of SCIENCE in it.)<br /><br />\\"My Clone and I\\" would qualify as SF.  So would \\"The Night of the Leavened Bread\\" which, although it is about a golem, also features Baruch Rogers, Space Rabbi.  The rest are about kabbalah  magic, demons, dybbuks, golems, and angels.  (This seems to be a problem with Jewish SF in general.  Jack Dann's \\"Wandering Stars\\" anthologies also contain more fantasy stories than SF.  I look forward to the day when Jewish characters can pilot spaceships and build robots without being plagued by hackneyed dybbuks and golems. )<br /><br />Next question: are these really stories for children?  Well.... They are definitely stories ABOUT children, in that the main characters are kids.  But they strike me more as high-school level parodies, patterned on the Yiddish stetl tales of Sholem Aleichem.  \\"A Dybbuk in North Tonawanda\\" even retains Aleichem's  dialect style.  It  could just as easily be taking place in Kasrilevke as in the USA.  However, this style requires a familiarity with Yiddish (or at least Yinglish)  to get a lot of the humor.<br /><br />To get the jokes in \\"The Night of the Leavened Bread,\\" you need to recognize things like \\"221B Bakery Street\\" as a play on Sherlock Holmes' address.  Ditto for some \\"yeshivish\\" themes and puns that would go over the heads of the average kid outside the Orthodox Jewish community.  (For that matter, \\"Baruch Rogers,\\" a take-off on Buck Rogers,  is more a joke for the over-50 grandparents who might be reading this out loud.)<br /><br /> \\"Lip Service\\" is a piece of in-group theological humor that is more like hermeneutics than a story.

True, SOME Jews do not believe in an afterlife, but others most certainly do.  Unfortunately, her academic credentials (quite bona fide) have made this book something of a classic in the field, with the result that it continues to mislead the general public about Jewish beliefs.<br /><br />When I met Sukie at a conference in Las Vegas a few years back, I asked her if she had interviewed any Hasidic rabbis or other Orthodox Jews for her study.  No, she replied, she had not.  Who, then, did she actually survey?  Mostly secular colleagues at various academic institutions.  Therefore, in my opinion, her presentation of Jewish beliefs is not valid, because it does not in any way represent a true cross-section of Jews.  It merely represents a limited, specialized sample of secular Jewish academians on college campuses.  Pretty sloppy research if you ask me, especially since she went out of her way to contact believing members of the other religions.  The fact that Sukie is herself Jewish makes it even worse.  She should have known better.	2005-01-16

I'm actually giving 5 stars to a book I used to hate.  When I first read \\"The Red Magician\\" 20 years ago (it was first published in 1982) I was deeply offended by the harsh way in which the rabbi is portrayed.  In the very first chapter he curses the Jewish school for teaching Hebrew as a secular language, because \\"Hebrew will only be spoken when the Messiah comes and we return to the Holy Land.\\"  OK, there were (and still are) Jews who believe that way about Hebrew.  To this day, the Satmar Hasidim do not speak Hebrew as a secular language.  But to curse a Jewish school and all the children in it?  Not likely.<br /><br />Not long after that, the rabbi threatens Voros, the Red Magician, with death if he ever enters the village again.  This didn't strike me as authentic, either.  Jews do not kill Jews, at least, not in pre-Holocaust Eastern Europe.  Excommunicate, banish, shun -- maybe.  But to actually kill somebody?<br /><br />Because these events occurred in the very beginning of the book, they colored my whole negative reaction to it.  I found myself thinking that this was going to be some sort of polemic against \\"backward\\" religious Jews who didn't fight against the Nazis, or didn't support Zionism, yada, yada, yada.  Had I reviewed this book back then, I would have trashed it for orthodox-bashing.<br /><br />Upon re-reading it this weekend, I had a different reaction.  Oh, the rabbi still comes across as harsh, but I was able to see that this was his own problem, rooted in his own lack of faith (to say more would be a spoiler.)  The book is not a polemic against religious Jews per se.  Rather, it is a fantasy exploration of the themes of guilt, revenge, misuse of power, letting go of anger, moving on with one's life, etc.  The rabbi has genuine mystical powers, but he had become harsh and unforgiving because he has allowed his own desire for vengeance to destroy his sanity.  This places him in the genre of black magicians everywhere, in every culture, real or imagined.<br /><br />The magical details in this book are very accurate in terms of  Jewish mysticism.  Lisa Goldstein really did her homework.  I could not find a single blooper -- and readers of my reviews know how much I just LOVE to nitpick mistakes in Judaica!  In this case, however, the rules of magic and the details for using it are perfectly in accord with kabbalistic legend(s).  Yashar koach -- well done!<br /><br />Readers should keep in mind that all the main characters are Jewish: Kicsi, Imri, Voros, Erzebet -- all are Jews, not just the rabbi.  The names they use, however, are Hungarian, rather than the Hebrew/Yiddish names that usually appear in stories about Eastern European Jews.  This use of secular names fits with the way magic works in the plot.  The point is very clearly made that to know a person's true name is to have power over that person.  Voros will not give his true (Hebrew) name to the rabbi for that very reason.  We can safely assume that everyone is using their Hungarian names as nicknames to protect against bad magic.  \\"Kicsi\\" means \\"Little One,\\" and \\"Voros\\" means \\"Red,\\" referring to his red hair.  (Is this a literary reference to King David, who, according to Jewish tradition, also had red hair?  Is he a descendant of David and therefore a possibility for the Messiah?  Or is he a lamedvavnik, one of the 36 hidden saints in Jewish tradition?)<br /><br />When the rabbi does learn the Red Magician's real name, he finally has the power to kill the one he believes to be his arch enemy -- but will he?

Adults will probably learn something, too.  (I did not know, for example, that Ramon's last name was originally Wolferman.  After he graduated from flight school in Israel, he decided to take a Hebrew last name.)<br /><br />The book opens with the blast-off of the space shuttle Columbia and the tragic explosion 16 days later.  Then it goes back to \\"In the Beginning\\" with the story of Ilan Ramon's life, his career as a fighter pilot, how he was chose to be an astronaut, and his training at NASA.  There's an explanation of what a space shuttle is and how it works, the jobs the astronauts do, etc.  Also included are some of the experiments that kids had designed for the STARS program.  As payload specialist, Ramon was in charge of monitoring these science experiments and reporting back to Earth about their progress.<br /><br />Ilan was not a religious Jew, but he realized that, as the first Israeli astronaut ever, he was representing all kinds of  Jews everywhere.  He took several Jewish items aboard the shuttle Columbia, including a mezuzzah, a Torah scroll, and a drawing of a moonscape drawn by a 14-year-old boy who died in a Nazi concentration camp.  Ramon also ate kosher food aboard the shuttle.<br /><br />The last chapter, \\"Fallen Heroes,\\" handles his death very well.  The author explains that \\"Astronauts know the risk they are taking when they journey into space.  But that doesn't make losing them any easier when tragedy strikes.\\" (p. 37)  The book closes with warm memories of Ilan from family, colleagues and friends, along with photos of his funeral.  Altogether, this book presents a very human, personal picture of a hero that children of all backgrounds can look up to.<br /><br />[Reviewer's P.S.

Judith Seid is a \\"cultural Jew,\\" that is, a Jew who relates to the history, music, art, customs and traditions of Judaism in a secular way, but who does not believe in God or \\"the religion.\\"  Her book explores non-theistic ways that cultural Jews can connect with their heritage.  (Isaac Asimov would have loved this book -- he was just such a cultural Jew.)<br /><br />Much of this book is way too secular for my own tastes, but the author does raise some challenging questions about Jewish history, liturgy, and traditions that made me stop and think.  She has also clearly demonstrated what I have been saying for years, namely, that Jewishness is more than just a \\"religion.\\"  This book clearly explains that POV.<br /><br />Although Judaism is commonly defined as a religion, the Hebrew language does not have a separate word for \\"religion.\\"  Neither does Yiddish -- the closest you can come is \\"Yiddishkeit,\\" which simply means \\"Jewishness\\" and encompasses everything from liturgy to foods and music.<br /><br />I myself define Jews as a tribal culture in the anthropological sense: common language (Hebrew), common land of origin (Israel), common ancestor story (Abraham and Sarah), common foods and holidays, and common religion.  (Seid does not use this exact breakdown in her book, but her ideas are compatible with the tribal model.)  A secular Jew may reject \\"the religion,\\" but still deeply connect with the other aspects of Jewish culture, in the same way that a Native tribal person might remain connected with their language, foods, dances and ceremonies, even if they do not believe in the tribe's mythology.<br /><br />Much of this book focuses on how to re-define Jewish holidays and life-cycle events in non-theistic ways.  There is a strong  emphasis on connecting with the tradition through land and nature.  The holidays themselves are labeled according to the seasons in the Contents, and the observances she suggests are centered around such activities as growing your own horseradish for the Passover Seder, feeding the homeless during Sukkot, seeking introspective solitude with nature on Yom Kippur, tasting fruits on Tu B'Shevat, etc.  There are lots practical suggestions and resources, too, including recipes and websites that I found useful even though I'm not a secularist.  (One site, for example, told me where to get pre-fab hardware for erecting a sukkah with 2 x 4s.)<br /><br />This book is more than mere \\"lox and bagels Judaism.\\"  Seid has  given a lot of serious thought to her presentation and, whether or not you can accept her point(s) of view, it is clear that she is fully committed to her Jewish identity.  I recommend this book to anyone -- Jewish or not -- who would like to understand why being Jewish is so much more that a \\"faith\\" or \\"religion.\\"ion through land and nature.

Others here have already dissected the plot for good and bad, so I'm going to focus on one particular area:  The fact that Darya Bat-Levi discusses her Jewish background with her therapist, Tyvan.  Some reviewers saw this section (pp. 30-33) as \\"strangely labored\\" and out of place, but I was DELIGHTED to see it.  As my regular readers know, I've been doing an ongoing study of Jewish themes in Star Trek (soon to be a book, \\"Where No Rabbi Has Gone Before\\").  So any Jewish reference in Trekdom  catches my eye immediately.<br /><br />As far as I know, this is the first time a character in a novel has clearly said, \\"I'm Jewish.\\"  Oh, there have been hints before (see my Trekmania list) but not such a clear reference.  We should note, to those who though this section was \\"too religious\\" for Trek, that there is such a thing as a secular or \\"cultural\\" Jew, which is how Bat-Levi describes herself.  Jewishness is not just a religion, it's more like a belonging to a tribal people.  Religion is part of it, but there are also atheist Jews who still identify with the culture and history of their people.  (More on that?  See the book \\"God-Optional Judaism\\"  by Judith Seid, a Humanist Jew.)<br /><br />As a cultural Jew, Bat-Levi gets some things right and misses on others.  Her explanation of \\"an eye for an eye\\" as monetary compensation for the loss of the eye is esentially a correct interpretation of standard Jewish law.  He explanation of Jewish afterlife teachings, however, is off-base.  True, there is no eternal hellfire and brimstone in Judaism, but there is a judgement of the soul as a sort of \\"life review,\\"  where one is called to account for one's deeds.  \\"Devout Jews\\" (Bat-Levi's words) do not believe that the soul is just a \\"piece of God\\" that loses its identity after death, as she explains it.  This idea is more Buddhist or \\"new age\\" than classical Judaism.<br /><br />Although it is a common misconception that Jews have no belief in life after death, the fact is, Judaism does teach that there is a soul which lives on in the Next World.  There is even room for Jewish beliefs in reincarnation, as I have explained in my own books on that topic (available here on Amazon.com)<br /><br />Now granted, this story is taking place in the 24th century, and Bat-Levi does say \\"I can't speak for every Jew.\\"  There's certainly room for individuals to believe as she does, it's just not what \\"the devout\\" believe.  Still, I was very happy to see this acknowledgement of my culture in a Trek novel.  We Jews have survived as a people for over 3500 years, so it makes sense that we will still be there 300 years from now., Judaism does teach that there is a soul which lives on in the Next World.

Reb Nosson was the chief disciple and official scribe of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov.  As such, he sought to compile his Rebbe's teachings for future generations.  Reb Nosson writes in his introduction to this volume:  &quot;I have therefore recorded a small portion of his saintly ways, from his earliest perception until his departure from this world in peace.  I myself heard some of the accounts from the Rebbe's holy lips.  Others were gleaned from those who knew him during his lifetime.  Much of what is written here was seen with my own eyes.&quot;<br />&quot;Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom&quot; contains first-hand anecdotes from the life of Rabbi Nachman, an account of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and a selection of lessons that he gave to his disciples.  Many well-known Breslov sayings are found in this book, such as: &quot;Every man [person] can attain the highest level.  It depends on nothing but your own free choice...for everything depends on a multitude of deeds&quot; (p.29) and &quot;Worldly pleasures are like sunbeams in a dark room.  They may actually seem solid, but one who tries to grasp a sunbeam finds nothing in his hand.&quot; (p. 112).  This is also the source for the list of Ten Psalms that are recited for &quot;Rebbe Nachman's Remedy.&quot;  In short, this book is a goldmine of wisdom and a must-have for anyone interested in Breslov teachings.	2004-07-04

Business deals are falling through, his marriage is on the rocks, and he is deeply depressed.  Through a series of &quot;concidental&quot; events, he meets a Hawaiian kahuna, who teaches him how to meditate and get in touch with a past life in fifth-century Brittania.  The kahuna tells Martin to remain detached and simply observe the events, without getting involved in this past world.  Presumably, this was so he would not change history, but it made the early part of the book rather boring, because all he did was watch events and then go back to the kahuna for a lecture on what it all meant.  Fortunately, as the story progress, Martin finds that he cannot simply stand by and do nothing.  He becomes an active part of the timeline, and the plot gets more interesting.<br />Whether or not he changes history is unclear, but he does grow personally from the experience.  We do not learn until the end of the book which of the past-life characters has reincarnated as Martin in this life -- and was I surprised!<br />I found this to be a good read, although I strongly disagree with the New Age &quot;you create your own reality&quot; philosophy.  I actually groaned when the kahuna told Martin that he had &quot;manifested&quot; the thugs on the beach because of his own energy or whatever.  Sorry, folks, I just don't buy it.  At that point, I decided that the only way for me to relate to this book without getting annoyed with the philosophy was to see it as a sort of &quot;alternate universe&quot; science fiction.  I could then allow myself to enter its worldview for the duration, even if it was alien to my own way of thinking.

Buck)	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Timeless love story with hints of reincarnation	Having never been to India, I cannot judge this book on its cultural authenticity.  The India that Buck portrays here is a country in transition (right after her independence), as are the characters within the book itself.  Buck's gentle, touching explorations of arranged marriages versus \\"falling in love\\" could probably be applied to any traditional culture that is confronted with modernism.  Can romantic love alone overcome differences of culture, caste, social and economic status?<br />Perhaps because the book was published in 1970, it deals with the sexual themes modestly and gracefully, without degenerating into gratuitous porn like so many of today's novels.  It is enough to know that the characters sleep together, we do not need the details.  More important is Jagat's discovery that \\"love\\" and \\"sexual intercourse\\" are not the same thing.  In the case of the relationship between Moti and Father Paul, there is no physical sex at all -- just a deep, platonic love bordering on the mystical.  And although Bert and Veera are deeply attracted to each other, neither could live \\"happily ever after\\" in the other's world.  These are timeless themes, regardless of the setting.<br />There are hints of reincarnation in the book, too, suggesting that  perhaps the lovers had known each other in another life and found each other again in this one.  Reincarnation becomes more obvious toward the end of the book, after Jagat's son, Jai, is killed in battle.  His mother is convinced that he still lives -- and perhaps he does, in the body of a 9-month-old child who reaches for a mummified tiger's paw that used to belong to Jai.  Was he Jai returned?

I bought this book in 1992 when it first came out, and entered my Life List up to that date.  It's still my Life List journal for North American birds --  the most recent was a migrating Wilson's Warbler that stopped to rest here during this past week, probably because of the heavy rain.  Getting the book out to make that entry today is what inspired me to write this review.<br />Unlike the check-off lists in the back of the field guides, where there is barely room for the date the bird was seen, this handsome volume has the common and scientific names for each species, little check-off boxes for whether you saw it or heard it (or both), a line each for the date, location, and habitat, along with extra lines for any further remarks.  The margins are nice and wide, too, allowing for yet more comments, and there's some blank pages in the back.  I use those for my secondary list of birds we have seen on our hobby farm in Minnesota (87 species to date.)<br />In the 12 years I've had my copy of this journal, I have entered plenty of notes.  Paging through the book is a double delight, both for the fond memories and the gorgeous reproductions of 48 Audubon paintings.  In addition to the artwork, there's a nice intro by Norman Boucher, some marginal quotations from Audubon's journals, and updated remarks about endangered species and subspecies.  The order of the bird list follows the 1983 American Onithologist's Union (A.O.U.) Checklist of north American Birds. There's also an index, so you can locate a species quickly.<br />The book itself measures 10 1/4 x 7 1/4 inches, with a library quality binding, a full-color textbook-type cover (i.e., no dust cover) and heavy glossy pages that will last a lifetime.  It's a  bit bulky to carry along on birdwalks, but that's not how I use it anyway.  I keep this book at home on the shelf, safe from the many perils of the trail (such as today's rain!) When I sight a new bird, I transfer the entry from my field notes when I get back.  I do find that fresh ballpoint ink smears on the slick paper if you're not careful, but this problem is easily solved.  Simply insert a piece of typing paper between the pages until the ink dries.  This is a small inconvenience compared to the permanence of the book. I plan to pass my copy down as a family heirloom.back.

I ordered it because I have personally been involved in Jewish-Muslim-Christian dialogues (trialogues?) in the USA, and I resonated with the reviews I had read.  What surprised (and saddened) me was the extreme difficulty that Yossi had in even finding people willing to dialogue in the Middle East.  I had been told that Israel was a segregated society  (not officially, but socially) but I did not realize how deeply the mistrust runs.  Villages and monasteries that are within visual sight of each other might as well be on different planets.<br />To cross the cultural divide can literally mean taking your life inot your hands.<br />Author Yossi Klein takes that risk.  With the help of various unconventional guides, he meets with Sufi shaykhs, Armenian priests, Catholic nuns and many others, hoping to communicate on the level of the soul rather than politics.  Sometimes he succeeds, sometimes not.  On so many occasions, history intrudes with its memories of past brutalities -- Crusades, Inquisitions, the Holocaust.  This is not a sugar-coated utopian view of peace, but a scathingly honest chronicle of one seeker's search for common ground in a troubled land.  With each new encounter, Yossi struggles with his own anger, distrust, and fear -- as did I when I read the book.  Definitely a must-read for everyone who is or wants to be involved in interfaith dialogue.	2004-05-06

It's not exactly \\"counseling\\" in the modern sense, because the Rebbe is regarded as a saint, not a therapist.<br />Most of the modern psychobabble in this book was added later, apparently as an attempt to make the book more marketable in the therapy and New Age communities.  The problem is, a \\"yechidus\\" is not a therapy session.  It's more like a darshan between a guru and his disciple.  By trying to \\"secularize\\" our understanding of this dynamic, the book cheapens the Yechidus, while failing to give a comprehensive model for psychological counseling.  For this I am docking it a star -- but, if you are interested in the dynamics of pre-Holocaust Hasidic counseling, the book is still a treasure trove of first-hand source material.<br />Although another reviewer here has objected to Schachter's heavy reliance on personal experiences and oral traditions that he heard in the Hasidic community, one must keep in mind that the thesis was done shortly after the Holocaust.  As such, it was a major ground-breaking work, written long before the current revival of Hasidism.  In many cases, this book is the ONLY source of Hasidic anecdotes that would have otherwise been lost forever.  (Schachter himself is a Holocaust survivor.) I therefore do not fault Schachter for drawing upon his own memory rather than personal interviews.  In many cases, such interviews would have been impossible, because the people in question were already murdered by the Nazis by the time Schachter got into his doctoral studies.	2004-04-30

This is the story of a loving friendship between an elderly Jewish lady from Poland named Mrs. Katz, and an African-American child named Larnel.  Mrs. Katz lives alone in her apartment and doesn't have anyone to visit her.  (It's not stated in the book, but, since this appears to be a predominantly African-American inner city neighborhood, one wonders if she was left behind by the Jewish community when the more affluent members moved to the suburbs?  In real life it has happened...)  Larnel's mother stops by to visit her every other day or so, and brings Larnel with her.<br />One day, Larnel gets the idea to give Mrs. Katz a kitten from the litter that was born in the basement of his apartment building.  (Get the pun -- Katz/cats?  Actually, the name \\"Katz\\" has nothing to do with \\"cats,\\" but it's cute anyway.)  Mrs. Katz names the kitten Tush, which is Yiddish for \\"bottom,\\" because it has no tail.  Larnel agrees to help her care for Tush, and from this sharing, a lifelong friendship grows.<br />The story is well-written, the characters are well-developed and \\"real.\\"  The illustrations are vibrant, beautifully done, and ethnically accurate.  Well, almost.  There are a couple Jewish bloopers.  For one thing, the menorah sitting by Mrs. Katz's window only has seven branches.  A Hanukkah menorah has nine -- eight for the eight days plus an extra for the \\"servant\\" candle.  The seven-branched menorah mentioned in the Bible was specifically for the Jerusalem Temple, and is not usually found in the home.  Since Hanukkah was mentioned in the story, I have to assume that this was supposed to be a Hanukkah menorah.<br />The second blooper is the scene in the bakery.  Mrs. Katz is shopping for PASSOVER -- a time when no leaven is to be found anywhere in a Jewish home.  It is not just a matter of eating matzoh.  The entire house is cleaned of anything even resembling leaven, and even owning leavened products is forbidden.  That being the case, why is she shopping for her Passover feast in a bakery, of all places?  She is clearly pointing at a cake or some rolls, and these would NOT be served on Passover!  So nu, maybe she's a Reform Jew and not so strict?  But in that case, why is that very Hasidic-looking gentleman in the corner shopping there?  Surely HE would not serve bread for Passover!  (...)<br />These are relatively minor quibbles, given the overall good quality of the book.  But when it comes to children's books, I insist on total accuracy with regard to Judaism, because these are the images that will stick in the mind for years to come.  Granted, this is not a \\"Jewish\\" book per se, it's a multicultural book -- which is all the more reason to pay more attention to the Jewish details, lest the reader(s) be misled.  For the bloopers I'm docking it a star, but it's still a great story and I highly recommend it to both Jews and gentiles.ssover feast in a bakery, of all places?

(We should clarify here that \\"Breslov\\" is what the group calls itself, named after the town of Breslov in Ukraine.  \\"Bratzlav\\" is a mistranslation by Martin Buber, who apparently confused the Ukrainian town with one in Germany.  Both names refer to the same Rabbi Nachman, great-grandson of the Ba'al Shem Tov.)<br /><br />In preparing this volume, Aryeh Kaplan (translator/compiler) drew upon authentic Breslov source materials, many of which existed only in manuscript form or oral tradition.  Other sources were rare volumes that had never before appeared in English.  (A detailed bibliography is included, with brief bios on the authors and info on the various editions cited.)  Of special interest are the little histories of each tale, i.e., the exact circumstances which prompted Rabbi Nachman to tell it.<br /><br />In addition to the better-known tales such as \\"The Lost Princess\\" and \\"The Seven Beggars,\\" this book includes many shorter tales and parables that, to my knowledge, have not appeared in any other English collection.  My only complaint is that the asterisks and brackets within the text (referring to notes below) detract from readability, and the English is rather clumsy at times.  For oral storytelling, I prefer Adin Steinsaltz's \\"Beggars and Prayers.\\"  But for good scholarship, Kaplan's book is unsurpassed.	2004-03-19

For reading around the Shabbos table, &quot;Beggars and Prayers&quot; is far superior to the Breslov Research Institute's 1983 &quot;Rabbi Nachman's Stories&quot; translated by Aryeh Kaplan.  The Kaplan volume is a complete collection of all the Nachman tales, with copious notes and commentaries, but the word-for-word translation is very clumsy to read out loud.  &quot;Beggars and Prayers&quot; is subtitled &quot;Adin Steinsaltz retells the tales...&quot; and the keyword here is &quot;retells.&quot;  He adheres closely to the originals in details and plots, but his prose flows more smoothly.  Both are good books.  Get Kaplan for the authentic Breslov (Bratzlav) traditions, history, and excellent scholarship.  Get Steinsaltz for oral reading and storytelling.<br />&quot;Beggars and Prayers&quot; is not a complete collection of the Nachman stories.  Steinsaltz has chosen six representative tales (the titles vary somewhat from Kaplan's collection, due to the different translations):<br />(1) The Losing of the King's Daughter<br />(2) The Merchant and the Pauper<br />(3) The King's son and the Maid<br />(4) The Master of Prayer<br />(5) The Clever Man and the Simple Man<br />(6) The Seven Beggars<br />For each of these, he provides an end-of-chapter commentary that explains the inner symbolism, including much of the kabbalistic imagery.  This is expecially useful for &quot;The Seven Beggars,&quot; which is one of the most complex and difficult of the Nachman tales.  When this book first came out, it opened up the meaning of the tales for me in many new ways, and I still enjoy re-reading it after all these years.  It's currently out of print but there are used copies around, so do buy it when you see one!	2004-03-19

It's the Aryeh Kaplan translation of Hishtpakut ha-nefesh, a classic complilation of Rebbe Nachman's teachings on spontaneous personal prayer (hisboddidus), which is a central part of Breslov daily practice.<br />The source-quotes for many well-known Breslov concepts can be found here:  Repeating one word over and over like a mantra (p. 24); pouring out your heart to God in your own language (p. 20); spending time in solitude (p. 28); finding yourself in the Psalms (p. 24); meditating outdoors where &quot;each blade of grass sings out to God&quot; (p. 42); The &quot;silent scream&quot; technique (p.40); and much more.<br />The booklet also contains an excellent overview of the history of meditation in Judaism, written by the translator, Aryeh Kaplan.  Kaplan brings to this translation his expertise in meditation practices, which he has written about more extensively in his own works.  The original compiler of these quotes, Rabbi Alter of Teplik, also wrote an intro, which is included here, too.	2004-02-20

Fans of avant-garde photography and soft porn will no doubt love this book, but I found it offensive.  No religious Jew, man or woman, would pray in a tallis and tefillin while so scantily clad.  These may be the fantasies of an old man going through his second puberty, but they are not the kinds of images that I would want in my kosher home.  There are ways to portray the beauty of Jewish women without the goyishkeit of stripping their clothes off.<br /><br />The book is doubly disappointing because some of Nimoy's past projects have included narrating NPR concerts of High Holy Days music and PBS's excellent video on Hasidic Judaism (\\"A Life Apart: Hasidim in America\\"), portraying a Holocaust survivor as well as Tevye, plus many other performances that gave him a patina of authenticity where Judaism is concerned.  Even in Star Trek, he brought his Jewishness along in creating the \\"Vulcan salute\\" and much of Vulcan culture in general.  Because of this background, his fans will now be misled into thinking that this book portrays something authentically Jewish.  It does not!<br /><br />I am deeply disappointed that Mr. Nimoy fell for the neo-pagan myth of the Shekhinah as a personified \\"goddess.\\"  Ever since  Raphael Patai published that awful book called [[ASIN:0814322719 The Hebrew Goddess]] back in the 1970s, which claimed that Caananite idols were once part of Judaism, this canard has continues to circulate in the gentile world.  In real Judaism, the Shekhinah is not a goddess, it is the indwelling presence of God.  It's the \\"spirit of holiness within\\" all things in God's creation -- more analagous to the \\"Holy Spirit\\" than to a goddess.  It is a feminine ASPECT of God, yes.  But to personify it with photos of women is a form of idolatry that has no place in Judaism.<br /><br />The popular misconception of Shekhinah as a woman comes from the fact that the word is GRAMMATICALLY feminine in Hebrew.  So are the words for \\"soul,\\" \\"Torah,\\" \\"prayer\\" and a lot of other things, because EVERY noun in Hebrew is either masculine or feminine, the same as Spanish or French.  There is no neuter pronoun in Hebrew.  But, when Hebrew is translated into English, the he/she pronouns become \\"it\\" instead.  Granted, this does eliminate much of the male-female imagery in the Torah.  But Nimoy's book is not the way to reclaim the feminine symbolism.  Had he called it something else and left out the Jewish references, it might have passed as an artistic study of the female form (he is a good photographer.)  As it is, the book is a neo-pagan travesty. What a sad exit for the great actor and writer who gave us the complex (and very modest) character of Mr. Spock.Y noun in Hebrew is either masculine or feminine, the same as Spanish or French.

Although there have been some unauthorized (and in some cases, spurious) translations of Ashlag's work over the years, none has been as accessible to the English-speaking reader as this book.  The translations included here were done with the permission of Rabbi Yisroel Miller, who holds the Hebrew copyright to Ashlag's works, and who graciously allowed Mark and Yedidah Cohen to use the original materials. In their introduction, the Cohens discuss their choice(s)of words for this translation, and their struggle to remain true to Rabbi Ashlag's thought.  They also include an excellent glossary of &quot;Keywords, Definitions, and Concepts.&quot;<br />Yehudah Ashlag is now regarded as one of the greatest kabbalists of the 20th century.  Born into a Hasidic family in Warsaw, he was a child prodigy whose interest in kabbalah was awakened at an early age.  In their introduction, the Cohens write: &quot;The story is told that at the ages of eleven, a book fell off a shelf and hit him on the head.  His father picked it up and while replacing it, told him that it was a book for angels, not for people.  But the young Yehudah decided that if it was printed, then it was certainly intended for human beings!&quot; (p. 20)  Thus began his secret study of kabbalah, along with the more usual course of yeshiva studies. At the age of 19 he was ordained as a rabbi by the rabbis of Warsaw, and served as a rabbi in that city for 16 years.  In 1924 he moved to Israel, where, in 1926, he began writing his works on kabbalah.<br />Rabbi Ashlag's best-known work is &quot;Ha-Sulam,&quot; (The Ladder), a complete translation of the Zohar from Aramaic into modern Hebrew, along with his own commentary on each paragraph. He also wrote a number of introductory books and articles on basic kabbalistic concepts.  Due to extreme poverty, the original self-published editions were quite limited, but still circulated widely enough to attract both disciples and critics.  By publishing this material, he went against the convention of the time, which was to limit access to advanced Torah scholars.  But Rabbi Ashlag correctly perceived that Jews in our generation would not be satisfied to merely learn the outer forms. The time had come, Rabbi Ashlag believed, to make the inner teachings of Judaism accessible to everyone.<br />However, we should also note that he also stressed the importance of practicing the teachings in daily life, through Torah and mitzvot (the commandments).  Unlike some of the &quot;neo-kabbalists&quot; who have co-opted his writings over the years, Rabbi Ashlag did not break with Orthodox Judaism.  Rather, he sought to enrich the experience of the Torah life by revealing the inner meanings of the outer observances.  Kabbalah is something a Jew does IN ADDITION TO traditional Torah observances, not &quot;instead of.&quot;<br />Kabbalists from the &quot;Jewish Renewal&quot; school of thought may be surprised to learn that &quot;Four Worlds Judaism&quot; is not something unique to the Renewal movement.  Rather, these ideas are clearly outlined in the works of Rabbi Ashlag, who, in turn, took them from the teachings of the 16th-century mystic, Isaac Luria.  He, in turn, received them through the Zohar.  In his &quot;Introduction to the Zohar&quot; (included in this book), Rabbi Ashlag clearly explains the Four Worlds (levels of existence: Action, Formation, Creation, Emanation) as well as many other basic concepts necessary for understanding kabbalah.  That these teachings have now become so widespread is perhaps due to Rabbi Ashlag's courage in bringing them out of secrecy and into the light.

I especially recommend it to readers of Aryeh Kaplan's books on Kabbalah and meditation, because the Torah is the basis upon which Jewish mysticism is based.  Kaplan's vast knowledge of the Jewish mystical sources is evident here also.  He brings to his translation work a deep  sensitivity that not only renders the literal meaning of the text, but also clarifies the implied meaning through careful choice of words and detailed footnotes, including maps, diagrams, and drawings of different species of plants and animals, common utensils, clothing, etc. described in the text.  In many cases, these are updated from previous English translations, based upon the flora and fauna of Israel, as well as archaeology.  (The &quot;turtle&quot; in the old King James Version is not a reptile, it's a bird -- the turtledove.)  The diagrams in Leviticus are especially helpful in visualizing the construction of the Mishkan (Tabernacle) and the species of permitted and forbidden foods. (How many of us know what a hyrax looks like?) I use this translation regularly in my own Torah studies, and recommend it to anyone who either does not read Hebrew, or who wants a good commentary to go along with the Hebrew text.  Ten stars!	2004-02-02

Hence the four star rating -- it's a good read, but not as good as its predecessor.<br /><br />There is very little science fiction here -- most of the pieces are more like fantasy, and some would be difficult to distinguish from ordinary Jewish folklore.  I.B. Singer's &quot;The Last Demon&quot; is one of these, as is &quot;The Celestial Orchestra&quot; by Howard Schwartz, which is really a re-telling of a classic tale by the 18th-century Hasidic Rebbe, Nachman of Breslov.<br />Don't get me wrong -- there is some good speculative fiction  included.  I especially liked &quot;Phyllis Gotlieb's &quot;Tauf Aleph&quot; (named after the last and first letters of the Hebrew alphabet), about a robot programmed with the entire corpus of Jewish knowledge and sent to the planet of the last Jew in the universe. (That one is definitely SF). In &quot;Dress Rehearsal&quot; by Harvey Jacobs, a group of aliens are learning English from a Jewish actor  -- with humorous results, but you need to know some Yiddish to get the jokes.  The same is true of Isaac Asimov's intro, where he slips into the Yinglish patois of his Jewish upbringing, to give us a tongue-in-cheek SF analysis of the Bible.<br />On the more serious side, there's &quot;Warm Dark Places&quot; by Horace L. Gold, which is a sort of sequel to his &quot;Trouble With Water&quot; in the previous &quot;Stars&quot; anthology.  But, whereas &quot;Trouble&quot; is rather  humorous, &quot;Dark Places&quot; is a creepy little tale.  Then there's &quot;Camps&quot; by Jack (&quot;Yankele&quot;) Dann, where a hospital patient keeps having nightmares about life in a concentration camp -- a place where he has never been, in this life at least...  (Readers of my own books on cases of reincarnation from the Holocaust should note that Dann's story was published in 1979, only three years before my first case in 1981.  I find that rather eerie.)<br />Quite a few of these stories require a modicum (or more) of knowledge about Jewish history and culture in order to understand the themes or, in some cases, the satire.  &quot;Leviticus: in the Ark&quot; is one such, where a man is chosen each year to be locked in the Ark at the front of the synagogue where the Torah scrolls are kept.  No, folks, there is NO such a ritual in Judaism, and never has been.  The tale is an allegory for loss of faith.  Ditto for &quot;The Pagan Rabbi.&quot;  In the case of &quot;Forcing the End&quot; by Hugh Nissenson, it helps to know the story of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai -- which Jack Dann has thoughtfully provided in his intro to the tale.<br />As for the rest of the stories, most of them didn't do it for me.  Harlan Ellison's &quot;Mom&quot; was a hackneyed disappointment, because the &quot;Jewish Mother&quot; stereotype is so outdated and overworked.  Then again, it was written in 1976.

This book, first published in 1974, was billed as \\"the first time in  a science fiction collection that the Jew -- and the richness of his themes and particular points of view -- will appear without a mask.\\"  Mask?  What mask?  The mask of non-Jewish pennames, for one thing. Did you know that \\"Clyde Crane Campbell\\" is really Horace L. Gold?  Or that William Tenn is Phillip Klass?  Heck, even \\"Jack Dann\\" doesn't sound very Jewish.  As Isaac Asimov points out in his intro to this book, many Jewish F&SF writers of the pulp era used gentile-sounding pennames to get published,  because antisemitism kept people with names like \\"Chaim Ishkowitz\\" out of print.  Asimov was the first Jewish SF writer to use his own ethnic-sounding name because, as he explains in the introduction, \\"I didn't know any better.\\"  (Asimov's intro, entitled \\"Why Me?\\", is a real gem -- be sure to read it!)<br />Jews also come out of the closet in the stories themselves.  In most F&SF of the time (and even today) you rarely see an openly Jewish character or theme.  Here in \\"Wandering Stars,\\" we meet futuristic rabbis, Hasidim, dybbuks, golems and more.  Some of the stories are humorous, others are spine-chilling.  \\"Gather Blue Roses\\" falls into the second category: Imagine a highly-developed empath trapped in a Nazi concentration camp...  Then there's \\"Trouble with Water,\\" which is more of a fantasy, as is the I.B. Singer classic, \\"Yachid and Yachidah.\\"  Two of the stories also deal with the theme of gilgul (reincarnation): \\"The Jewbird\\" by Bernard Malamud, and \\"I'm Looking for Kadak\\" by Harlan Ellison.<br />One thing which struck me about this collection is how many of the stories assume that Jews will still be persecuted in the distant future.  William Tenn's \\"On Venus have we got a Rabbi\\" actually uses persecution as the definition of \\"Jewishness\\" on a planet of non-humanoids.  In \\"Paradise Last,\\" Jews who score well on standardized achievement tests are \\"rewarded\\" with a planet of their own -- and thereby removed from mainstream society.  These are good stories, but I would like to think that there could be a better future-vision for my people.

Now, says Kirschenbaum, it's time to bring color to the literary classics in high school textbooks.<br />This project began with a simple question from one of her students in an inner-city school: &quot;Ms. Kirschenbaum, how come our books are not in color like they used to be?&quot;  The student pointed to a picture in her textbook, a medieval illumination of a tale from Chaucer.  In the days before Gutenberg's printing press, most books not only had color pictures, they used colors in the text itself, as well as various styles of writing, to emphasize the most important words in a block of text.  Gutenberg himself kept some of this style when he printed his famous Bible, which had ornate borders that were hand-painted later.  But within a very short time, color left the writer's pallette, to be replaced by the stark black and white rectangles of text we see today.<br />In chapter 4, &quot;The Gutenberg Cliche,&quot; Kirschenbaum discusses how this switch from color to black and white has affected the study of the classics.  Alongside her discussion are actual historical examples of such authors as Virgil, Dante, Aristotle, Cicero, and Aquinas -- before Gutenberg (in color, varied types of text), during Gutenberg (blocks of text with margins illuminated in color), and today (black and white, no color.)  The earlier colored versions certainly look more inviting to read.  Kirschenbaum's students agree.  As an experiment, she has designed handouts of the classics which use color and varying fonts to highlight the text.  Overwhelmingly, the students prefer the color versions.  Colors help them to find the main points, to get the rhythm of poetry, and to feel the emotions of the characters.  The plain black text of the same material was overwhelmingly rated as  dull, boring, hard to follow.<br />As Kirschenbaum explains, we lost color in texts because, when technology went from hand illuminating to the printing press, it was not cost-effective to typeset words in different colors.  Typesetting also required that lines of text be straight and uniform.  This &quot;Gutenberg cliche&quot; --square boxes of dull black text -- continues today, even though we no longer typeset our books ala Gutenberg.  All publishing today is done by computer, which opens up a whole new range of possibilities if we can think outside box.  Kirschenbaum's front-line experiments in the classroom prove that students are more attracted to color, and more likley to read a book if it is in color.  After all, these kids grew up with TV, movies, video games -- all in living color.  The only place they see plain black text is in school books.  Our curriculum, says Kirschenberg, has not kept up with the way kids are learning today.<br />In the academic world, however, Kirschenbaum's work has received a  negative reception, which she discusses in a chapter illustrated with Bosch-like characters and the flames of hell.  What heresy! How dare this mere high school teacher -- who doesn't even have a Ph.D. -- presume to present a new theory of education?  One foundation turned down her grant for research because there was no previous research in this area.  (How's that for thinking in a rut?)  A rude professor called her &quot;Madame Nobody&quot; to her face and dismissed her work without really looking at it.  Such people would do well to remember that Albert Einstein was a lowly patent clerk when he published the theory of relativity -- a theory that forever changed the way we see the universe.<br />Discouraged but not defeated, Kirshenbaum decided to self-publish this book to demonstrate her theory.And she does it well.  Not only is color effective, it doesn't cost any more that a similar book in black and white.  (The list price of this book -- in full color -- is only $24.95). The resulting work is a collection of lavishly illustrated chapters that are a feast for the eyes and a challenge to the way we think about writing.  This should be required reading for all educators -- I give it ten stars!And she does it well.  Not only is color effective, it doesn't cost any more that a similar book in black and white.

This was one of the first collections of first-hand testimonies about Hasidic non-violent resistance to the Nazis to come out in English, and that gives it important historical significance.  Published in 1980, the people interviewed were already old back then, and may well have gone to the Next World by now -- which makes the content of this book absolutely priceless.<br />The book opens with a fictional dialogue among various types of Jews at the time of the Eichmann trial.  Who was a hero?  Those who grabbed guns and joined the Resistance -- yes, they were brave war heros.  But there was another kind of hero also -- that of the Hasidic youths in Poland who, from the very beginnings of the rise of the Third Reich, utterly refused to cooperate in any way with the \\"satan\\" (Hitler).  It is this little-known true story of non-violent resistance that the book tells.<br />One of the founders of this movement was a ba'al tshuvah (Jew who grew up secular and later became religious) known as Mattisyahu the Penitent.  In his early youth he was an assimilated Austrian  Jew growing up in Vienna.  Then came Hitler.  Suddenly his \\"friends\\" at school were calling him a \\"dirty Jew.\\"  One day, Matti decided to visit the Jewish section of the city, to see if Jews really were any dirtier than anyone else.  There he met the Rebbe of Boyan, a Hasidic leader who was visiting Vienna at the time.  This encounter changed Matti's life forever.  At the age of 15, he dedicated his life to God, and, against his father's wishes, went to Poland to study Torah with the Gerer Rebbe.<br />When the Nazis occupied Poland, Mattisyahu urged his fellow Jews not to cooperate in any way.  Do not register for the German work crews.  Do not wear yellow stars.  Do not give up your Jewish hats, beards, and sidecurls.  Continue to study Torah, observe the Holy Days -- in short, keep your dignity as Jews.  The secularist leaders of the Jewish community said this was utter folly: to disobey the Nazis meant death.  \\"Mattiyahu's Men\\" knew this, but they also understood that the Nazi goal was to break the Jewish spirit.  To yield on one point would lead to yielding on others and, in the end, they would lose more than their physical lives.  They would lose their souls.<br />The firsthand testimonials in this book come from survivors of many ghettos and concentration camps where Mattisyahu's Men studied and taught their way of non-cooperation.  Some of the storytellers were themselves among \\"those who never yielded.\\"  Even the secular Jews came to respect them.  As one burly baker named \\"Red Nuta\\" told told a Hasid who asked for bread to smuggle to a hidden group of Hasidic scholars:  \\"If you are one of Mattisyahu's Men, you deserve the bread.  You 'soft' chassidim are the only ones who don't let those rats spit in your faces.\\" (page 75)<br />The book is a gold mine of such inspiring stories.  However, one must be willing to dig through the not-so-perfect English and rather poor print quality.  This was a short-run book, published by a small press with few resources, for distribution within the yeshiva community in Brooklyn, where English is a second language.  In places the translation reads very strangely, such as calling Mattisyahu's Men a \\"clique,\\" which might be the right word in French, but in English it has a negative connotation that doesn't fit here.  Still, if you are willing to overlook these flaws, the book is a valuable documentary of a little-known non-violent resistence movement that developed completely independently of Mahatma Gandhi, founded by a man who was every bit as saintly.

It took me a while to get around to reading this book, because, by the time it came out, I was over-saturated with 9/11 materials.  But this is a very different type of story from those about Ground Zero.  When the United States shut down its airspace and diverted all those planes elsewhere, 38 of them ended up in Gander, Newfoundland, a fishing town of about 10,000.  The reason was simple:  Gander, in spite of its small population today, has an enormous airport.  During World  War II, American military planes  refueled at Gander before heading across the ocean to Europe.  Until the invention of the jet engine, Gander was the &quot;biggest gas station in the world,&quot; and many planes still stop there to refuel.<br />Physically, Gander Airport could accommodate all those big planes landing, but what about the passengers?  That's the real story of Gander -- how the people opened their hearts and homes to total strangers and mobilized every resource they had to comfort and care for the thousands of travelers who suddenly found themselves stranded.  It was humanity's finest hour.<br />This book abounds with human interest stories, such as: the fire engine racing to the next town with sirens blaring, to bring back toys for the &quot;plane children&quot;; the animal protection volunteers who crawled into the bellies of the grounded planes to rescue and care for the passengers' pets; the American family returning from Kazakhstan with a newly-adopted daughter; the big party for the four kids with birthdays that week... and many, many more.<br />I was especially pleased to read about Rabbi Sudak, the Orthodox Jew (Lubovitcher Hasid, actually) stranded in Gander, who set up a small kosher kitchen and ministered to other stranded Jews, as well as curious locals and a &quot;secret Jew&quot; who lived in the area and &quot;came out&quot; to the rabbi.  I was aware of this story because I had read about it in a Jewish newspaper but, in all the TV coverage of Gander, I never heard the rabbi mentioned once.  In fact, there was a total lack of coverage of Jewish chaplains anywhere during the mainstream 9/11 coverage.  This annoyed me to no end, because I KNEW that rabbis and lay Jewish workers were ministering during the 9/11 efforts, the same as their Christian counterparts. So it was very heartening to see this story included among the many tales of courage and caring.<br />On the technical end, the book is well-written.  The author, Jim Defede, is an excellent storyteller.  In the course of writing the book, he interviewed over 180 people.  From these, he chose a few representative stories to follow through the entire six days of the crisis.  At the same time, he paints the bigger picture very well, so that we can see how the whole town of Gander -- as well as several other towns in the area -- were part of it.  He also weaves in cultural and historical background about the area, such as the history of the airport mentioned above.  (Which, by the way, answered my own questions about why all those planes were sent to a tiny town.  I remember wondering about that at the time.)  All in all, this is an excellent book -- one that I could not put down once I started reading.ever heard the rabbi mentioned once.

However, &quot;Healing Power of Pets&quot; is more than a collection of animal anecdotes.  There's a lot of good, solid scientific information woven in, too.  Dr. Marty Becker, a veterinarian who has worked with Animal-Assisted Therapy programs, cites numerous studies which show that people who are bonded with their pet(s) lead longer, heathier lives.<br />On page 74, for example, he refers to a 1995 study conducted by Erka Friedmann, a professor at the Department of Health and Nutritional Studies at Brooklyn College.  She recruited 392 patients who had suffered heart attacks and were part of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial.  Of these, 87 owned dogs and 282 did not.  A year later, only one of the dog owners had died, while 19 of the non-dog-owners had passed away.  In other words, people who own a dog are far more likely to be alive a year after having a heart attack.<br />Why is this?  Many reasons are given in the book: dog owners get more exercise, they take better care of themselves because they feel responsible for the dog, they relax while petting the dog, they are less lonely because of the dog, etc.  Other studies have shown that the act of stroking an animal's fur lowers the human's blood pressure like a form of meditation.<br />As a Jewish educator reading this book, I could not help but reflect on the fact that, compared to the general population, far fewer Jews have pets.  In the Orthodox and Hasidic communities, especially, it is rare to see a dog in the house.  One reason is because dogs were used to track and kill people during the Holocaust and other persecutions, so they have bad associations for many Jews.  I understand this.  Still, I found myself wondering how many of those 282 non-dog-owners in the Brooklyn College study were Jewish. (Brooklyn has a high percentage of Jews.)  Are we allowing Old World fears about dogs to deprive us of a valuable form of therapy?<br />The pet doesn't have to be a dog, however.  Cats (of which I have ten!) are equally therapeutic.  So are other species, such as birds, rabbits, guinea pigs, etc.  Even watching a tank full of fish can help a person to relax.  The important thing is the Bond between the animal(s) and the human(s).  Reading this book confirmed in a scientific way what I have always believed in my heart: this  special Bond is a healing gift that God designed into the very fabric of creation.of Jews.)

He did so because his own teachers recognized that American Jews in the 60s and 70s were growing up without knowledge of these traditions, and were therefore abandoning Judaism for other religions in order to be &quot;more spiritual.&quot;  Hence this and other books by Kaplan on Jewish meditation.<br />Kaplan's books are still considered to be among the most authentic on the market, and are kosher even among the Orthodox and Hasidic branches of Judaism.  His first book, &quot;Meditation and the Bible,&quot; came out in 1978, and explored the various meditation techniques that were hinted at in the Bible and expanded in other Jewish texts.  This was followed by &quot;Meditation and Kabbalah&quot; (1982), which explained the techniques in greater detail and provided first-ever English translations of many basic Hebrew texts.  Both of these books, however, were quite academic and not intended to be how-to guides.  Hence the third book here, &quot;A Practical Guide&quot; to Jewish meditation, published in 1985.<br />I mention the first two books because, if you read only this one, it may strike you as just another &quot;new age&quot; hodge-podge of ideas.  Far from it.  Kaplan took his cues from the most Orthodox of the Orthodox, i.e., the traditionalist Jews who had not lost the pre-Holocaust knowledge of these techniques. In his first two books, he clearly lays out the theory, drawing upon centuries-old Hebrew texts and first-hand descriptions by Jewish &quot;saints&quot; of various eras.  In &quot;Jewish Meditation,&quot; he distills all this down into directions for actual daily practice.  If these resemble &quot;new age&quot; ideas in some places, it is only because the New Agers have recently re-discovered terchniques that the Jews have used for literally thousands of years.<br />It is this little-known mystical tradition that Kaplan sought to make accessible to the average English-speaking reader.  He was aware that many Jews had experienced success with Eastern meditation, but were not comfortable with some of the idolatrous practices that went along with it (such as chanting the names of Hindu gods, which is forbidden in Judaism.)  He was also aware that the general public thinks of Jews as &quot;Old Testament Hebrews&quot; ala Cecil B. DeMille, who supposedly worship an &quot;angry god&quot; and have no inner spirituality.  Kaplan's work corrects both of these problems.  Whether you are Jewish or not, if you meditate or are thinking about doing it, you will find this book to be of great help in understanding the Jewish Path.ion that Kaplan sought to make accessible to the average English-speaking reader.

It was also the first collection of stories about Jews who did NOT lose their faith during the Holocaust (most of them, anyway -- there are one or two exceptions in the book.)  Prior to this, religious Jews in the Holocaust were portrayed by the media as as \\"cowards who didn't fight back\\" rather than the religious martyrs that they were.  (Most typical of this anti-religious period is the infamous line from the movie version of Leon Uris's EXODUS: \\"The only god I believe in is a gun.\\")  I won't go into the politics of it here, but, suffice it to say, the post-Holocaust Zionist movement was more interested in freedom fighters than saints.<br />The Hasidim, however, had a different view of their suffering during the Holocaust.  God had not deserted them, even if He seemed hidden in a time of darkness.  The Hasidim were telling their own Holocaust stories around the Sabbath table or at community gatherings but, because most of this telling was oral and in Yiddish, it was unknown to the general public.  Enter Yaffa Eliach.  As a professor of English literature at Brooklyn College, she began hearing these tales from her students.  Brooklyn College had/has a high percentage of Hasidic students and, through them, Eliach got to know their parents and other Holocaust survivors, including some of the Hasidic Rebbes.  The result is a fine collection of true Holocaust stories that will forever change the way you view Hasidic Jews.  Courage, as this book demonstrates, doesn't always mean grabbing a gun.  It can also mean hiding a child, sharing your food when you yourself are starving, or meeting death with your human dignity intact.  To maintain one's faith under such adversity, to continue studying Torah and doing the mitzvahs even in a concentration camp -- these were acts of true resistance that shine through every page of this book.

After studying the Jewish laws of burial and the role of the Chevra Kadisha (burial society), they formed their own Chevra and began to offer thier members the option of a plain pine box, to be provided for free by the congregation.<br />This is a reprint of a book that first came out in 1981.  At that time, I was living in Minneapolis, where these events took place, so many of the people involved are personally familiar to me.  Rabbi Arnold Goodman, the author, was the pulpit rabbi at the synagogue.  The story was also featured as a TV documentary, which received wide acclaim at the time.<br />The many challenges that the congregation faced -- ranging from paranoia by the funeral industry to concerns about government burial ordinances to opposition within their own membership -- are all covered here in detail.  In addition, Rabbi Goodman discusses many important issues surrounding Jewish funerals.  I highly recommend this book as a primer to any congregation -- Jewish or not -- that is considering a return to simple funerals.	2003-10-10

She soon realized that in order to relate to her patients, she needed to understand their culture.  She felt an inner drive to become a &quot;nyanga&quot; -- that's the Venta word translated &quot;witch doctor&quot; although, frankly, I would prefer the word &quot;shaman&quot; -- and although it was very unusual for a white woman to do this, she was eventually accepted and trained by other Venta healers.<br />The book is filled with fascinating stories and anecdotes about her &quot;double life&quot; -- as a witch doctor and a Western medical nurse -- and provides some very authentic insights into what African traditional healing is like.  She also deals with the negative side, i.e., the &quot;sangoma&quot; witch doctors who cast curses, etc. although she herself does not practice this.  Mostly, she &quot;throws the bones&quot; -- a form of psychic reading similar to Tarot cards, I guess.  Specific bones are used for this, and each bone has a special significance.  A nyanga's collection of bones must be acquired in certain ritual ways, when the person is ready to have them, i.e., you can't just go out and buy a set.<br />As she explains, a nyanga functions primarily as a psychologist and an herbalist.  For serious medical problems, she referred her patients to the clinic.  The fact that she knew and understood traditional African medicine enabled her to win the trust of her clients so that, if she said they needed Western medical treatment, they went.  A similar type of co-operation exists today in the USA between native and medical healers, but this did not begin to happen until the 1980s.  Rae Graham was way ahead of her time.	2003-10-09

Since then, I have learned that the FIRST Jews to arrive in the Americas were Sephardic, many of them fleeing the Spanish Inquisition.<br />&quot;The Road from Babylon&quot; traces the history of the Sephardim from the  Babylonian Captivity (hence the title) to the present day (or at least to 1985, when this book was published.)  According to the text, &quot;Sephardic&quot; orignally referred to the Jews who fled Spain in 1492, but is now applied to &quot;Jews whose ancestors lived in the Balkans, Asia Minor, North Africa, and all round the Mediterranean in the Near and Middle East.&quot; (P.1)  We should also note that the majority of Jews in Israel today are Sephardim, descended from Jews who fled persecution in the Arab countries after Israel was founded in 1948.  (121,000 left Iraq in 1951 -- see p. 231.)<br />In terms of format, the book is well-written and researched, and includes two sections of B&amp;W photos, showing Sephardic communities, synagogues, and traditional dress down through the centuries.	2003-10-09

Unlike the overly-ponderous works of Gershom Scholem, this is a book that the average person with a college-level reading ability can pick up and understand.<br />The author, David Ariel, is (or was at the time this was published) President of the Cleveland College of Jewish Studies, and, I would assume, produced this book to fill a gap in the usual (i.e., heavily Christian/gentile) college philosophy curriculum.  By doing so, he has no doubt educated quite a few professors as well as their students in the beauty and complexities of various forms of Jewish mysticism.<br />Ariel begins with the question &quot;What is mysticism?&quot; and a discussion of some non-Jewish writers on mystical topics, such a William James, Sigmund Freud, Aldous Huxley, Evelyn Underhill, etc. -- names whose works are generally more familiar to philosophy students than those of the Jewish mystics.  He then goes on to present the basic concepts of Jewish mysticism (kabbalah) chapter by chapter, drawing on commentaries, Zohar, classical anecdotes from Jewish tradition, excerpts from the synagogue liturgy, etc.<br />One of the best features of this book is Ariel's gift for translating &quot;archaic&quot; symbols into modern language.  On pp. 98-99, for example, he give a glossary of kabbalistic symbols and terms, then challenges the reader to use them to decipher a cryptic passage from the Zohar -- which becomes quite clear, once you understand the &quot;code.&quot;  He does an equally nice job with &quot;Lecha Dodi,&quot; a Sabbath hymn that every Jewish congregation sings on Friday evening, but whose deeper kabbalistic meanings are seldom understood. His original translations of source materials are also excellent, making this a very accessible book without &quot;talking down&quot; to the reader.  Highly recommended.er.

I'm giving this book 5 stars for being well done in its genre, NOT because I necessarily agree with the content. I already devoted an entire chapter (\\"Did the Soul of Hitler Repent?\\") to this book and its claims in my own published work, \\"From Ashes to Healing: Mystical Encounters with the Holocaust\\" (available here on Amazon),so I'm not going to re-hash all that in this review.  Suffice it to say, if this material is indeed the voice of Hitler speaking from beyond the grave, then he still has a lot of serious soul-searching to do.<br />The most interesting part of the book, to me at least, was the description of the self-made isolation \\"bunker\\" that Hitler's soul shut itself up in for decades.  If, like me, you believe that there is a \\"life review\\" after death and if, as so many near-death experiencers (NDE-ers) have reported, this review makes you face all the pain that you have caused to others, then it is perfectly plausible that Hitler was terrified of his personal Judgement Day after death.  At that point, the channeled Hitler seems genuinely repentant.  I found myself wondering:  What if Hitler had had an  NDE during his lifetime on earth?  Would he have changed his behavior?  Probably not.  As the book progresses, it becomes clear that he is still in \\"denial\\" and making excuses for all the horror that he caused in his life on earth.  The chapter on \\"Why the Holocaust\\" is filled with repugnant \\"blame the victim\\" material -- the \\"bargaining stage\\" of recovery -- where Hitler tries to find some sort of  karmic justification for his behavior.  He never gets beyond that stage in the book.  At one point, the \\"Conversations\\" claim that the Holocaust victims were in altered states of consciousness in the camps, and therefore did not feel the pain of the torture.  Try telling that to the living survivors.<br />Regarding format, Schuster's \\"Conversations\\" are well-edited and readable.  So much of the New Age channeled material reads like ponderous gibberish, because the channeler(s) regard every grammatical error and idiosyncracy of speech as if it were sacred writ, never to be corrected.  Not so with Michael Schuster.  Either he channels in near-perfect English, or he took the time to copy-edit his material into a more literate format.  That's why he gets 5 stars from me, even though I highly disagree with much of what he (and Hitler?) wrote.he channeler(s) regard every grammatical error and idiosyncracy of speech as if it were sacred writ, never to be corrected.

Parts of this are not at all the way we Jews think of Moses, but, if you approach it as a sort of modern midrash (commentary), it makes for some interesting reading.  Although my guess is that Ponder is a Christian (there's a \\"Millionaire from Nazareth\\" in her series), there is no attempt to convert anybody to anything in this book.  Rather, she goes step-by-step through a series of basic prosperity principles, which she derives from the story of the Exodus.  She also shares a lot of inspiring rags-to-riches anecdotes.  The basic message is to trust in God, think positively, and take the \\"manna\\" (opportunities) that God gives you.  Not exactly original advice, to be sure, but I enjoyed the way that she presented it here.<br />One complaint: I HATE the all-yellow cover.  This was probably meant to evoke \\"gold\\" in the minds of Ponder's readers but, for most Jewish people, yellow immediately reminds us of the yellow stars in the Holocaust, as well many other yellow-badge stigmas that Jews were forced to wear in Medieval Europe.  If the publisher wants a color that reminds the reader of money, then green would work much better and be far more positive for Jewish readers to have sitting on the coffee table.	2003-10-08

It is, in fact, put out by their press, and takes most of its case histories from ECK practitioners.  Clearly, the book is intended to lead people to practice ECK.  As I am not a practitioner of that Path, I cannot evaluate it in those terms.  I will say, however, that it has some excellent techniques for developing your &quot;dream memory,&quot; learning from your dreams, soul travel, meeting spiritual masters in dreams, fending off psychic attacks, etc. -- if you are able to translate the ubiquitous references to ECK into those of your own religion or Path.  (For example, instead of chanting &quot;Hu&quot; as the ECK people do, I chant Hebrew mantras.) The book also includes some material on understanding past-life dreams, which is probably why I received a review copy (I have written three books on reincarnation, all available here in Amazon).  For those who practice ECK or one of the Eastern or New Age philosophies, this would be a most helpful book.  For myself, I prefer something more theologically neutral.	2003-10-07

And Here My Troubles Began	Books	5	18	24	N	N	A daring format for a moving tale	When I first heard about MAUS, I was among the most negative of skeptics.  What did Art Spiegelman mean by producing a COMIC BOOK version of the Holocaust?  Wouldn't this trivialize a great tragedy?  How could anyone even THINK of reducing it to \\"Bam! Zap! Pow!\\" and other such stereotypes?  The very idea offended me.  Then I actually READ read the book -- and discovered how wrong my assumptions were.<br />Let's face it, folks -- most books on the Holocaust are college level, heavy-duty reading.  There are plenty of people out there who will never, ever plow through a thick historical tome, but who might just pick up a copy of MAUS and learn something.  Academians may skoff at such things as \\"classics comics\\" and MAUS, but I have met quite a few high school students who admitted that MAUS was the only book on the Holocaust that they had ever bothered to read.  For that alone, Spiegelman well-deserves the many awards and high acclaim that MAUS has received over the years.<br />As for the story itself, the characters are well-developed, and the animal metaphors quite creative.  (The Jews are mice, the Nazis are cats, the Polish collaborators with the Nazis are pigs, etc. Also pay close attention to how the Jewish mice wear masks to \\"pass\\" when they must go outside from hiding.)  Although this has been classified as fiction by some, the story is based on Spiegelman's interviews with his own father, and the incidents are authentic enough that, even if they are fictionalized, they certainly could have happened in real life.  This is a story of genuine courage -- not the \\"Pow! Zap! Bang!\\" kind in superhero comics, but a tale of bravery just the same.	2003-10-07

They also give you plenty of good vegetarian recipes from around the world.  Sprinkled thoroughout  their book are quotations, prayers, and meditations from different Paths to help make your cooking experience a more spiritual one.  Also included are well-written essays on how such mundane activities as chopping, slicing, and stirring your foods can become a form of meditation when done with focused intention and centeredness.<br />Regarding Jewish content, the book does include Judaism among its lists of quotes, as well as a section on the various foods used in the Passover Seder (pp.112-115).  Disappointingly, however, there is no mention at all of the preparations and food rituals connected with Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath.)  The Passover Seder is performed only twice a year (first and second evenings of Passover) but the Sabbath happens once a week -- 52 times a year -- and is on a higher spiritual level than Passover in the cycle of Jewish life.  For an observant Jew, the Sabbath is the focus of the entire week, to the point that, if we find an especially nice fruit or vegetable, such as one that is just coming into season or difficult to obtain, we save it to serve in honor of the Sabbath. This makes the Sabbath a central part of food consciousness when we go shopping during the week.<br />The authors here do mention the Jewish &quot;hamotzi&quot; blessing over bread (p.42) but seems to have no idea that the most common time to say this would be over the two specially-braided loaves of bread (challah) served at each of the three sacred meals on the Sabbath.  To be fair, the Robertsons are not the only writers to make this mistake -- other eclectic books of this type overlook the Sabbath also.  I find myself wondering if this might not be the subconscious result of negative attitudes about the Sabbath in the Western gentile/Christian world (the Robertsons are not Jewish.)  At any rate, they missed a major area of Jewish food symbolism here.<br />There is also a serious blooper on pp. 102-103 which states that &quot;Moslems fast during the day and Jews fast in the evening.&quot;  This is wrong.  Most Jewish fasts, both public fasts and those for private vows, are from sunrise to sunset, exactly the same as the Muslim fasts.  The only time Jews ever fast in the evening are on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) and Tisha B'Av (mourning for the Destruction of the Temple), both of which are 24-hour fasts that do begin at sundown.  Jewish DAYS always begin at sundown (I'm not sure if Muslims are the same, or if they begin at sunrise) but our FASTS generally do not.  Somehow, the Robertsons got this mixed up.  For this blooper and the omission of the Sabbath above, I am docking the book a star, but it is still an excellent resource and well worth buying.gentile/Christian world (the Robertsons are not Jewish.)

This is one of the more convincing cases for reincarnation that has come across my desk in a long time.  I had already heard of Jeffrey Keene before the book came out, because he is featured in the 2002 documentary video, &quot;In another Life: Reincarnation in America&quot; (Gold Thread Video Productions).  I was impressed with his story then, so it was a pleasure to finally be able to read the book (which came out after the video.)<br />Jeffrey Keene did not go searching for this experience.  In fact, he was skeptical at first. He makes it clear that he did not undergo hypnotic regression (which he distrusts) but rather, the memories came to him in various spontaneous ways, beginning with a strange familiarity at the sight of a battlefield.  As he describes his visits to battlefields, graveyards, and other sites, he provides the reader with well-researched historical detail.  In my case, that's a good thing, since I am a not a Civil War buff and would not have made the past-life connections without the background info.<br />Most impressive is the uncanny physical resemblance between Keene in this life, and General Gordon in the past life. (Click on the cover photo here for an enlarged version to see for yourself.)  Genetically, he is no relation to the General, but, as researchers lke Ian Stevenson have demonstrated, the soul often does re-create physical characteristics in the new body.  Additional look-alike sets of photos are inside the book itself.  Keene also includes some photos of firefighters he has worked with in this life, who  bear a strong resemblance to Civil War figures he might have known in the past life.  All in all, it's a well-written book and a very good read.	2003-09-24

If you are reading it on the reviews page of more recent editions, the criticism regarding lack of Jewish reincarnation materials has been CORRECTED by the author (whom I met in person in Holland in 1997, where we discussed this issue.)  My advice being, get the most recent edition!<br /><br />First, the good news: This book, which was translated from the Dutch in 1990, provides a good academic introduction to the topic of reincarnation from a historical, scientific, and philosophical point of view.  The author, Hans TenDam, draws rather heavily on the teachings of Anthroposophy (the Rudolf Steiner people, i.e., Waldorf school philospophy, etc.), which is not surprising, since he himself is an Anthroposophist.  However, he does cover other approaches, both ancient and modern.<br /><br />Now for the bad news: TenDam fails miserably is in his treatment of the  reincarnation teachings in Judaism.  He pretty much limits himself to the Biblical texts, and does not seem to be familiar with the plethora of Jewish reincarnation teachings found in rabbinical and Hasidic sources.  On page 43 he states: \\"Judaism has few and weak indications for a belief in reincarnation but, for example, in the Old Testament, many and strong indications for a belief in the pre-existence of the soul.\\"  He briefly dismisses the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, them moves on to Philo, Jesus, and Simon Magnus (was he even Jewish?)  So, in one short paragraph, we leap from the \\"Old Testament\\" to the \\"New,\\" as if the Jews are merely a less-developed prefix to Christianity. (NOT!)<br /><br />There is virtually nothing about Jewish reincarnation teachings after Jesus, although TenDam does acknowledge that \\"Since the 8th century the Karaite Jews have believed in reincarnation.\\" (p.44)  He briefly mentions a Samaritan belief that Adam reincarnated as Seth, Noah, Abraham, and Moses, but dismisses that with \\"But doctrines that great leaders and teachers return do not imply that common people normally reincarnate.\\"  (p. 44 again)  Thus ends the less-than-half-a-page on Judaism in a 400+ page book.  Not one word about Hasidic Jews (ALL of whom still believe in reincarnation today and yes, the \\"common people\\" do come back, too.)  Not one mention of Kabbalah or Rabbi Isaac Luria, the great 16th-century Jewish mystic whose teachings are filled with clear references to reincarnation.<br /><br />Later in the book, TenDam does make brief mention of Jews reincarnating, but not in the context of THEIR OWN teachings.  Rather, they are simply cases of people who happen to be Jewish who showed up among a therapist's clientele. (see pp. 61, 255, 304.)  In conclusion, I would say that this book is a good college-level reference for reincarnation teachings and theory, but, if you want the authentic Jewish perspective, you will have to look elsewhere.

You will find none of that here.  In \\"A Seer Out of Season,\\" Dr. Harmon Bro portrays Cayce as a man with extraordinary psychic gifts, but also a human being, warts and all.  That's what I liked best about the book.  For the first time, I could relate to Cayce as a real person, not an overblown myth.  In my opinion, this is the best Cayce biography on the market.<br />This is NOT a debunking book. Bro personally worked with Cayce for almost a year in 1944, and retains a deep, abiding respect for \\"The Sleeping Prophet.\\"  He accepts the reality of Cayce's abilities, and continues to study the Readings.  However, in later years, there was a falling out between Bro and the Edgar Cayce Foundation, and Bro now has his own org.  Much of the controversy centered around Bro's more humanistic views of Cayce, as he is portrayed in this book.<br />The very fact that Bro knew Cayce personally is what prevents him from falling into the trap of hero worship.  As Bro himself writes: \\"For many -- though not all -- he [Cayce] is a modern equivalent to oracles of the past, celebrated in traditions of East or West, or in legends of Shamanism.  Yet this treatment rubs the face out of his portrait, because it removes an essential part of his story.\\"  (P. 5)  Amen.  If you, too, are interested in the man behind the Cayce legend, then by all means, do read this book.	2003-09-22

As a sci-fi short story, this might have worked -- it even has a twilight-zonish ending.  But as a full-length novel, it was a big disappointment.  I have read every other book by Robin Cook and this was the first one I did not like.  Hopefully it will be the last such bomb.<br />There isn't any real horror in this novel -- unless you consider boredom to be a form of torture.  The plot is a hackneyed new-age mish-mash of Brave New World, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and the Time Machine (only this time, the good guys went underground, er, undersea.) The characters are shallow and the \\"science\\" is utterly ridiculous -- how many times can you say, in essence, \\"This is so far advanced it's way beyond me...\\"?<br />Then there's the lack of good descriptive prose.  In Cook's previous books, we can get inside the characters' heads and really FEEL what they are going through.  In this book, the plot is carried forward through preachy dialogue and \\"orientations\\" that drove me up the wall.  Every good science fiction writer knows that the Absolute WORST way to explain things in an alternate world is to have some scientist or tour guide give a lecture.<br /><br />PLEASE, please, Dr. Cook -- go back to writing medical horror!	2003-05-08

To this list I  would add a fourth category:  Jews who, like myself, are familar with much of this material, but who sometimes need to be reminded of it in well-written, contemporary prose.  (Non-Jews will also find it an interesting window into the inner meaning of the Sabbath, although the book does assume that you know the basics.)<br />\\"Seventh Heaven\\" is arranged in short lessons that follow the complete cycle of the 26-hour Sabbath day, from pre-Shabbat preparations on Friday afternoon  to the post-Shabbat  celebration known as \\"Melavah Malkah.\\"  For each step, there are quotes from traditional sources, followed by Mykoff's essay (based on the teachings of Rebbe Nachman) about the inner meaning of the step in question.  The result is a clear roadmap for deepening your personal  experience of Shabbat.<br />Although the book can be read from cover-to-cover as a Shabbat manual, each lesson is also complete in itself.  Each one is a couple pages long -- perfect for a short dvar Torah at the Sabbath table.  Mykoff's writing style is both profound and contemporary -- a refreshing change from other  books written in that overly-pedantic Orthodox style that I call \\"Yeshivish.\\"  Mykoff writes for the educated English speaking public, and he does it well.  In short, this book is a pleasure to read -- again and again.	2003-04-07

At last -- a book that clearly explains the Jewish expectations of the Messiah without those pedantic \\"dueling Bibles\\" verse battles. This is not an \\"anti-missionary\\" book per se, although it does have a chapter on how to \\"just say no\\" and walk away from missionary confrontations, as well as a clear explanation of why individuals like Bar Kochba, Jesus, and Shabtai Zevi were not it. However, that is not the author's main intent for the book. Rather, he is presenting the Jewish teachings about the Messiah and the Redemption, step-by-step, drawing on Bible, Talmud, Midrash, Zohar, and many other classical sources.<br />The book is written in the form of a series of lesson dialogues between a fictional Rabbi Cohen and his student, Daniel. (This format has precedents in classical Jewish literature, such as Yehudah Halevi's \\"Kuzari.\\" It is also the way that Judaism is studied in real life.) Each week, Daniel comes with questions about the Messiah, and the rabbi answers them in clear, down-to-earth conversational prose. For those who want the actual Torah sources, these are included on the same page in smaller, indented type. Thus, it is possible to read this book in at least three ways: (1) For basic intro, read the dialogues and skip the source quotes; (2) To delve deeper, read the original sources (in translation) along with the dialogues; (3) To cite a quick reference, go to the appropriate chapter, or use the Source Index in the back of the book.<br />One problem that non-Hebrew-speaking readers may have is that the biblical books are named with their Hebrew titles, i.e., \\"Bereishis\\" instead of \\"Genesis.\\"  Unfortunately, these terms are not, unfortunately, included in the glossary.  however, it's not too hard to figure them out from the context of the verses themselves.  There is also an appendix called \\"Rabbi Cohen's Notes\\" which gives further source material and background info on the various individuals, historical periods, etc. discussed in the main part of the book.<br />And finally, the concluding chapter, called \\"9/11 and Beyond\\", warns against trying to fit details of current events into messianic end-time prophecies. As \\"Rabbi Cohen\\" points out to his student, there have been many periods in history when Jews (and others) mistakenly intepreted current events as The Last Days and ended up following false prophets -- with disastrous results. When the real Messiah comes, it will be obvious. Until then, we should yearn for the Messiah's coming every day, and study the basic principles of what to expect, but avoid getting into specifics about dates, events, which country or people is Gog or Magog, etc. The important thing is to concentrate on our personal obligations to to serve God, do mitzvot, and lead a Torah life, so we will be ready when the Messiah does come -- may it be speedily in our time.e book.  <br />And finally, the concluding chapter, called \\"9/11 and Beyond\\", warns against trying to fit details of current events into messianic end-time prophecies.

After having enjoyed Bruce Feiler's previous book, \\"Walking the Bible,\\" I was a bit skeptical when I heard about this one.  He had already covered the journey of Abraham in the first book, so what more could he add with a sequel?  It wasn't until I heard him talk about Abraham on National Public Radio that I realized this book is not another travelogue. It's a chronicle of Feiler's own inner journey to understand the connections among Judaism, Christianity, and Islam through their common father, Abraham.<br />As Feiler tells us in this book, the sedrah portion he studied for his own Bar Mitzvah was \\"Lech lecha,\\" the section of the Torah which deals with God's call to Abraham to leave his home and go to a place that God would show him.  It is said that one's Bar Mitzvah portion is forever connected with one's personal destiny.  This is certainly true in Feiler's case.  His lifelong fascination with Abraham has led him to write a very interesting and thought-provoking book.<br />Don't expect this to be a scholarly study.  It's not.  In fact, there are some glaring historical inaccuracies.  For example, Feiler credits the \\"Essene\\" Qumran community with \\"starting\\" the tradition of midrash (Jewish hermeneutics).  Apparently he's not up on recent Dead Sea Scroll scholarship, because it is now seriously questioned whether (A) the Qumran community was Essene and (B) whether the scrolls in question came from Qumran or a Jerusalem library that was hidden at the time of the Roman siege.  At any rate, midrash did not begin at Qumran.  (He also confuses midrash with the Mishnah at one point...)<br />I'm sure that Muslim and Christian readers will find similar errors -- but that's not the point of the book.  Feiler is  exploring how the three religions have viewed Abraham in various periods of their history, and how those perspectives have changed over the centuries.  What he seeks is a way to bring the three monotheistic religions together in a productive dialogue where they can meet as equals on the common ground of sharing their origins in Father Abraham.  He presents us with an Abraham that we can relate to at the beginning of the 21st century.  That's the heart of the book; all the rest is commentary.<br />Regarding that commentary, the book is a bit lopsided when it comes to Jewish POVs.  Feiler never identifies what kind of Jew he is, but I looked up his childhood synagogue, Mickve Israel in Atlanta, Georgia, and it's listed as \\"America's Oldest Reform congregation.\\"  Nothing wrong with that -- except that I suspect he carries a common Reform prejudice against Orthodox and Hasidic Jews.  He never interviews any  -- except for a token Hasidic boy who just happens to be at the Western Wall.  The Jews he does interview are all academic scholars and \\"modernized\\" rabbis.  On the other hand, he goes out of his way to talk to top leaders in the very traditional Christian and Muslim communities.  He seems fascinated with their colorful clerical garb; perhaps the plain black clothing of the Hasidic Rebbes was not as exotic?<br />There is also a certain flippancy about the way Feiler describes the relationship between God and Abraham, as well as his own relationship with the stories.  I realize that he is writing for the general public, and is probably giving voice to the \\"skeptic\\" POV for the benefit of his readers.  Still, the fact that he is Jewish and has not included the POV of the more traditional (and respectful) branches of Judaism leaves the reader with the wrong impression that all Jews are as irreverant as he sometimes is.  Muslim and Christian readers should be aware of this, i.e., that Feiler's reactions are his own, and do not represent the POVs of all Jews.  Within Judaism there is a vast diversity of views, the same as with any other group.<br />When he can set his academic skepticism aside, Feiler's prose soars and inspires.  At times it reaches the level of poetry. I get the feeling that this is the real Bruce Feiler, the sincere seeker who, like so many Reform Jews I've met, feels he must show a \\"scientific\\" face to the world but who, deep down inside, is a really a mystic on a quest.  Like all such quests, it is the process of the pilgrimage that transforms the person, not the facts he encounters along the way.  Read from this perspective, this book is indeed a fascinating journey.he sincere seeker who, like so many Reform Jews I've met, feels he must show a \\"scientific\\" face to the world but who, deep down inside, is a really a mystic on a quest.

This is your basic page-a-day-type desk calendar, with a Jewish twist.  If you memorize each day's word, you will have learned 365 Yiddish words -- actually more than that, because some days have a number of derivatives as well.  You will also learn quite a bit of Jewish history and interesting trivia.  In terms of format, this calendar begins on Jan. 1 of the secular year.  It lists both Jewish and non-Jewish dates and holidays, which is a very useful thing to have on your desk.  Most Jewish calendars don't have the non-Jewish holidays like Memorial Day or Easter, and most gentile calendars miss quite a few Jewish holidays or only list the first day of a festival and not the evening before, when the celebration really starts.  This one has both sets of holidays, so you can avoid inter-cultural scheduling bloopers.  My only complaint is that the pronunciation guide in the back is rather inadequate, and there is no indication of where the accent should fall on a word.  Author Ira Steingroot does explain that there are different dialects (true) but still... I'm giving it four stars instead of five, but it's still a fun calendar.	2003-01-22

The story is told how Rebbe Nachman of Breslov once suffered from amnesia and could not remember any of the Torah he had learned.  In desperation, he asked one of his disciples to recite the Hebrew alphabet.  He did -- and the Rebbe's memory came back to him.  After reading this excellent book, you will understand how that is possible.  The Hebrew alphabet is much more than 22 letters written on paper. Each letter has a numerical value, a number of symbolic Torah meanngs, and a mystical connection to the Creation of the Universe.  According to kabbalah, the Hebrew letters are the primal \\"energies\\" with which God spoke the Creation into existence.  The inner essence of a thing are the letters which compose its name in Hebrew. (The Overview in the book is entitled \\"Protoplasm of Creation,\\" and explains this concept in more detail than I can do here.)<br />Unlike so many of those pseudo-kabbalah books on the market, which attempt to use the Hebrew alphabet and its numerology for fortune-telling, this book is solidly grounded in authentic Torah sources.  Like all of Artscroll's publications, the approach is Orthodox, but also accessible to both Jews and non-Jews of all backgrounds.  This is not an easy-read \\"spirituality\\" book, however.  It is a detailed set of Torah lessons, to be savored slowly, one letter-chapter at a time.  The author also assumes that you are either familiar with basic Hebrew terms, or at least willing to take the time to learn them.  But even if you do not already know the Hebrew alphabet, this book will help you understand the deeper wisdom within traditional Judaism.	2003-01-17

The book begins with an excellent essay called \\"The Living Tree: A Festival's Growth through History\\" by Arthur Waskow.  His essay traces the development of Tu B'Shevat from an agricultural tax-date associated with tithing in biblical times, to a mystical meal to renew the Tree of Life in the Middle Ages, to it's current focus on ecology and global survival.<br />Waskow's essay becomes the framework for arranging the rest of the book like a growing tree.  After all, the Torah is called a \\"Tree of Life\\"!  The \\"roots\\" of Tu B'Shevat are found in biblical Judaism, the strong \\"trunk\\" was formed in rabbinical Judaism, and the \\"branches\\" are various post-Talmudic movements such as Kabbalah and Hasidism, Zionism and the Land of Israel, modern Eco-Judaism, etc.  Finally, there is a section on the Festival itself, which includes a variety of essays, songs, and other resources for celebrating the holiday.<br />Parts of this book are heavy on the \\"Jewish Renewal\\" POV, which is not surprising, since the \\"eco-kosher\\" movement began in that circle.  Some of the material, such as the \\"Olamama\\" love song to Mother Earth by Hannah Tiferet, is a bit too neo-pagan for my Orthodox tastes.  And while \\"The Bear in Me\\" is a nice idea for a song about nature waking up in the spring, the words \\"There's a bear hibernating in the crook of a tree\\" are not true to life -- unless the tree is meant to be a metaphor for Tu B'Shevat.  Real bears do not hibernate in trees!<br />On the other hand, there's quite a bit of traditional material, too -- some of it never before published in English.  Of special interest to me are a translation of the Ari's 16th-century kabbalistic version of the Tu B'Shevat seder, and a translation of a \\"lost\\" medieval poem called \\"Shemona Esrei of the Trees.\\"  The latter was unknown in modern times until it was re-discovered among the manuscripts that Solomon Schechter brought back from the Cairo genizah in 1896.  It continued to languish in the obscurity of academe until Joyce Galaski fell in love with it and did this translation.  The poem, which is believed to date to around the 10th or 11th century, is the oldest known liturgical piece based on this festival.  Not only that, it's beautiful! (The Hebrew text of the poem is also included.)<br />The rabbinical \\"trunk\\" section has two excellent pieces on the halachic principle of \\"bal taschit\\" (\\"you shall not destroy\\") and how it was expanded from a biblical prohibition against cutting down fruit trees in times of war (Deut. 20:19-20) into a general prohibition against vandalism, wastefulness, conspicuous consumption, and any unnecessary destruction of resources.<br />These examples are only a tiny nibble of the many gourmet tastes of Torah to be sampled in \\"Trees, Earth, and Torah.\\"  Like all such anthologies, it's definitely a mixed bowl of fruit, some sweeter than others.  Taken as a whole, however, the book is a wonderful feast!  It should be in every Jewish library.scripts that Solomon Schechter brought back from the Cairo genizah in 1896.

Spirituality is for people who have been there.&quot;  So wrote Abraham Twerski, founder of Gateway Rehabilitation Center, in his cover blub for Yehudah Fine's book, &quot;Time Square Rabbi.&quot;  Rabbi Fine (who prefers to be called &quot;Yehudah&quot;) has that rare balance of religion and spirituality, combined with a down-to-earth love of sports, music, and life itself, that enables him to reach lost teenagers on the mean streets of New York.<br />His writing style is clear and poignant, combining good descriptive details with well-written dialogues.  Each story illustrates one of the 8 steps in a recovery program that Yehudah has developed, based on the writings of Maimonides.  Although the characters and stories are composites (to protect the kids' privacy), they are so well done that they virtually leap off the page.<br />Every parent should read this book.  Yehudah pulls no punches about how these kids ended up on the streets.  For many, it was an escape from unbearable home situations.  In other cases, the parents kicked their kids out of the house with no idea what would happen to them out there.  In still other cases, kids from &quot;good homes&quot; set out with high hopes and unrealistic fantasies, only to be victimized by the predators that roam &quot;The Way Beyond.&quot;  That's Yehudah's name for the street culture that exists in the same physical space as up-scale Manhattan, but in a different world entirely.  Like real life, some of these stories have happy endings, others do not.  But all of them will make you think.  As the subtitle says, this is a book about finding hope.	2002-09-11

When I finally did open the book, I found out that it's not about the Holocaust per se, although that does play a part in the plot.  It's about a young Jewish girl growing up in a small Southern town in the 1950s, back when segregation was a fact of life, and those Jews who joined with blacks in the struggle for equal rights were targeted by hater-mongers.<br />The title, \\"Speed of Light,\\" refers to Einstein's theory of relativity.  Eleven-year-old Audrey Stern is fascinated by astronomy, and reads how time moves slower when things travel at greater speeds.  She ponders this idea literally, while looking up at the stars, and symbolically, by observing how time seems to \\"slow down\\" or \\"speed up\\" according to the events that are happening in her life.<br />As the book opens, those events are centering around her father's support of a black man's application to be on the town's police force.  Things get ugly fast.  Someone throws a rock through the window of Audrey's father's factory, anti-Jewish insults are hurled, threats are made, a swastika is painted on the synagogue...  All this causes Audrey's Aunt Pesel, who is an Auschwitz survivor, to have flashbacks about the horrors of the Holocaust.  Pesel fears that the same thing which happened to the Jews in Europe is beginning to happen in America.  She is so totally embittered by her Holocaust experience, that she cannot see any hope of a better future.  Audrey, in turn, resents Pesel's constant negativity, which permeates the whole house.  This is one of the most realistic parts of the book.  Pesel is not some sweetly-smiling pious martyr, not is Audrey a Pollyanna.<br />Their feelings toward each other are real.<br />To say more would be a spoiler.  On the whole, the book is well-written, but I must point out one glaring blooper: Audrey's little brother is feeding his pet Monarch caterpillars bread crumbs.  NOT!  In real life, they only eat fresh milkweed leaves.  On bread crumbs they would soon starve, and never become the beautiful butterflies that emerge at the end of the book...ole, the book is well-written, but I must point out one glaring blooper: Audrey's little brother is feeding his pet Monarch caterpillars bread crumbs.

That in itself is inexcusable, given that the Scrolls are, after all, ancient Jewish documents. It would be as if original manuscripts of the Gospels were discovered, but no Christian scholars were allowed to see them. Absolutely inexcusable!  Baigent and Leigh cover this story very well in this book.  Those who doubt that there was blatant antisemitism on the original Scroll committee can also read Strugnell's infamous interview with Ha-Aretz in the Hershel Shank's anthology, \\"Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls.\\"  As a Jew, I find it supremely offensive that people with such anti-Jewish attitudes were the ones to have control of the Scrolls.<br />Now that the texts of the Scrolls have finally been published for all to read, \\"The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception\\" may seem a bit dated and its conclusions anticlimatic.  Still, it does raise a lot of good questions about some of the basic assumptions that the general public holds concerning the nature of the ancient Jewish community that lived at Qumran -- a debate which, I'm sure, will continue for generations to come.	2002-04-22

This book reminded me of another book about a teacher who was plunged into the chaos of an inner-city school, namely, \\"Dangerous Minds.\\" The writing format is different (\\"Dangerous Minds\\" is a novel, this is a memoir) but the experiences are similar. Here is this new teacher, hired to teach English in a school where the culture and the kids are so totally different from what he is used to, that, as the rabbi who hired him says, \\"Think of it this way, you're going to Mars.\\"<br />In this case, teacher Gerry Albarelli is hired to teach English in a Brooklyn yeshiva run by one of the most conservative of the Hasidic sects. (He never says which one, but, judging from various clues in the story, my guess would be Satmar.) Here, English is a second language and the boys are not the least bit interested in learning it.  Everyone in their insular community speaks Yiddish anyway, and even the principal's English leaves much to be desired.  Add to this the bewildering (to Albarelli, at least) world of Hasidic life and its rules. The experience becomes, if I may badly mix a metaphor, a true \\"baptism by fire.\\"<br />The school days are long, from 6AM to 6PM -- the Hasidic world's solution to the daycare shortage.  Religious classes are in the morning when the boys are rested.  English classes?  They come at the end of the day, when the kids are all bouncing off the walls with pent-up energy.  The boys consider secular subjects to be time for recess -- and their classroom behavior shows it!  It doesn't help that the stories in the textbooks are about suburban middle-class Gentile families whose lives have nothing to do with the Brooklyn world that these boys live in.<br />Eventually, Albarelli wins the respect of his students through storytelling and acting out little plays that they make up in class, in order to practice their English. He never becomes a Hasid (or even a Jew) but does learn enough about the culture to begin to understand and respect it. After five years, however, he moves on to another position, leaving behind forever the chaos and exhuberance of the boys in this school \\"on Mars.\\"<br />My first reaction, upon reading this book, was embarrassment. Would it give a bad impression of Hasidism to the public? Then I remembered some of my own experiences as an Orthodox Jew teaching in the public schools in rural Minnesota. I, too, have had my share of spitballs, paper airplanes, flying pencils, kids who won't stay in their seats or even listen to what I say -- not to mention plenty of cross-cultural ignorance.  (If I ever write my own equivalent of \\"Teacha!\\" it will be called \\"Why Do you Wear that Little Hat?\\")  Albarelli's students regard him as less than a \\"real man\\" because he has no beard or sidecurls; my students consider me a wimp because I don't play sports. The rules may be different, but kids are all on the same basic search for identity and belonging. More than anything, Albarelli's book demonstrates that students are students everywhere.

That took me aback, because the Jews were slaughtered by the Crusaders.  To this day, Jews remember the Crusaders as persecutors.  Why then, I wondered, would this Palestinian speaker equate Israelis with the Crusaders?  I found the answer in this book: He did not see Israelis as Jews, he saw them as invading Europeans.<br />In European Christian folklore, the Crusaders are portrayed as pious knights-in-shining-armor, selflessly marching off to rescue the Holy Land from the \\"infidels.\\"  But to the Arabs and Jews who lived in the Middle East, the Crusaders, or \\"Franks\\" as they called themselves back in the 11th century, were ruthless barbarians who raped, pillaged, and murdered entire populations as they marched across the land like a hoard of devouring locusts.  Even more horrifying, the Crusaders sometimes roasted and ate the bodies of their enemies.  (Both sides recorded this. See chapter 3, \\"The Cannibals of Ma-arra.\\")<br />Although this book focuses on the Arab viewpoint, it does give brief accounts of what happened to the Jewish communities also.  Some readers may be surprised to learn that there were Jews living in Jerusalem and other Middle Eastern cities in the eleventh century.  It is a commonly held misconception that there were no Jews in the Holy Land between the destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70 and the establishment of the modern state of Israel.  In reality, the only time that Jerusalem was ever \\"Jew-free\\" was during the Crusades, when the \\"good Christians\\" slaughtered them along with the Muslim population.<br />The horrors of the Frankish invasions known as \\"Crusades\\" live on in the Arab collective memory, and this explains why any kind of Western presence in the Middle East is resented by the Arab world today.  It also explains why the Muslim community was so deeply offended when President Bush referred to his war on terrorism as a \\"crusade.\\"  Believe me, this book will forever change the way you hear that word.t Bush referred to his war on terrorism as a \\"crusade.\\"  Believe me, this book will forever change the way you hear that word.	2002-01-30

There are hundreds of color stills from the series, capturing the flavor of the show and some of it's most memorable moments.  Plus, the background material and the the interviews have some real depth, going into detail about casting, how the actors developed their characters, praises and complaints, interesting retrospective thoughts, etc.  That part is GREAT!<br />The bad news is, that the episode summaries leave much to be desired.  As the author herself states, she was working primarily from scripts.  That's a bad idea because, as every media buff knows, there are often last-minute changes and ad libs during filming that aren't in the scripts.  Not to mention what happens during editing.  The definitive version isn't what's written down on paper, it's what you finally see on the screen.  The result is, that characters are misquoted in the book, and sometimes the &quot;wrong&quot; plotline is given preference.  I realize it's a daunting task to watch 11 years of episodes over and over, but that's a must if you are going to write the &quot;complete&quot; book about a TV series.  So, for making those plot summary mistakes, I'm docking the book one star.<br />Still, it is a very nice hardcover reference, and will certainly help you put your tape collection in order.  (Although, now that the series is coming out on DVD, with all the episodes already in order on the discs, that won't be as much of a problem...) Even with it's deficiencies, it belongs in every MASH collection.	2002-01-14

Riva Zakutinsky and Yaffa Leiba Gottlieb (both Hasidic themselves), have given the public a highly-readable, intimate window into a world that would otherwise be inaccessible to most outsiders.  The result is an excellent book that will make you laugh, cry, and truly realize how the common humanity we all share can shine through outward differences. I plan to recommend this book to my neighbors, my local libraries, and readers of my Hasidism FAQ.  Like &quot;Joy Luck Club,&quot; it would make a great movie, too.  If I were a film producer, I'd jump at the chance!<br />The ten women who gather around Sarah's Table every Tuesday for lunch and Torah study are very religious Jews, but definitely not plaster saints. (Is that a mixed metaphor?)  They struggle daily with the same types of life challenges facing women (and men) the world over: caring for developmentally challenged children, coping with a serious illness in the family, becoming a step-parent, balancing home and personal life with a career.<br /><br />Oh yes, some of these women DO have careers outside the home.  For example, there's Shaina, author of a series of Jewish children's books.  And Reva, Shaina's publisher, whose husband encouraged her to start her business.  Not to mention Klara, the attorney, whose strict Hasidic observance led her to open her own law firm rather than &quot;sell out&quot; to pressures to conform.<br />Of special interest to the outside world will be the chapter on  Tamar, who is seeking the right &quot;match&quot; for her older daughter.  As you will learn from her story, Hasidic matchmaking is not the same thing as an &quot;arranged marriage.&quot; Naturally, Hasidic parents expect their children to marry Hasidim, and a matchmaker may help introduce a prospective couple to each other.  But the man and woman decide for themselves whether to marry or not. This dates all the way back to the biblical story of Rebecca, who was asked if she wanted to marry Isaac. (See Genesis 24:57-58)  Everyone, according to Hasidic teachings, has a destined match literallly made in heaven.  Sometimes, however, we make the wrong choices here on earth.  And sometimes, finding one's true soulmate can mean going to the ends of the earth -- as Klara's Polish mother learned in a tiny town in Russia.<br />One problem with the book is that the glossary assumes too much Judaic knowledge on the part of non-Jewish readers.  While the more obscure Yiddish and Hebrew words are defined in the glossary, common ones like &quot;Shabbos&quot; (Sabbath) and &quot;yeshiva&quot; (academy of Jewish study) are not.  And there is no pronunciation guide.  Maybe these terms can be taken for granted in Brooklyn where the authors live, but they require explanation in areas where there are few Jews.  (I myself live in a Midwestern town where people think my first name is &quot;Robbi&quot; and have no idea what a RABBI is -- until I say &quot;Jewish minister.&quot;)  I was also annoyed to see the late Lubovitcher Rebbe (Menachem Schneerson) defined as the &quot;most recent leader of the worldwide Hasidic movement.&quot;  He might be leader of the worldwide LUBOVITCH Hasidic movement (to which these women belong) but he's not my  Hasidic leader -- I'm a Breslover Hasid.  (Different group. There are over 150 other Hasidic groups besides Lubovitch.  The biggest, by  population, is probably Satmar.)  Hopefully these glossary shortcomings will be corrected in future editions.This dates all the way back to the biblical story of Rebecca, who was asked if she wanted to marry Isaac.

The first two are novelizations of the two Original Series Star Trek episodes that featured Harry Mudd: \\"Mudd's Women\\" and \\"I, Mudd.\\"  The third is an original story by J.A. Lawrence entitled, \\"The Business as Usual, During Altercations,\\" which picks up where \\"I, Mudd\\" left off.  Mudd's \\"angels\\" are the women, both human and android, in the stories.<br />Classic Trekkers will recall how, at the end of \\"I, Mudd\\",  con man Mudd was left marooned on a planet full of androids, including hundreds of replicas of his nagging wife, Stella.  In \\"Business as Usual,\\" Harry has managed to get off the planet and is selling the more attractive androids (but not the Stella series!) to lonely miners, in order to corner the market on dilithium crystals.  This leaves the Federation stuck without a supply of this all-important fuel.  It's the Enterprise to the rescue, of course, as Captain Kirk and crew outwit Harry Mudd once again.<br />The book is part of an out-of-print series that was published by Bantam back in 1978, before Pocket Books got a monopoly on Star Trek novels.  Bantam re-issued its series in the early 1990s, then they went out of print again.  There are plenty of used copies of both editions around, though, so check out ...	2001-10-23

As a folklorist myself, I found dozens of in-jokes that had me literally doubled over with laughter.<br />In the DS9 episode &quot;Rules of Aquisition,&quot; the Ferengi Pel claims to know all 285 Rules of Aquisition plus the commentaries. This book gives you some of those commentaries --- at least, for the 70 Rules that were actually revealed on the series. The authors, Ira Behr and Robert Wolfe, wrote most of the DS9 Ferengi episodes. Now they give you the story behind each of the Rules, including #113, the &quot;Rule that dare not speak its name.&quot;<br />You will also learn the first two words that any Ferengi learns in the Hew-Mon language (&quot;No refunds&quot;), The ten most famous insults in Ferengi history (see p.32) and the story of the infamous villain Drek, M.H.N.L.I.I. (May His Name Live In Infamy), who actually cut his prices and gave his customers BARGAINS, thereby causing the Ferengi economy to crash. Which is one reason why every Ferengi child is duly warned about the dangers of Real Life through supernatural horror stories about that bogeyman of bogeymen -- the Smiling Partner! And so on. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which has lots of great B&amp;W stills from the series, too. Drek was right --- some things really ARE bargains!	2001-10-23
US	52499409	RGPSWJCMKIRHK	1882664221	45518226	Teen's Guide to Getting Published	Books	5	19	19	N	Y	By teens, for teens --  a great intro!	As far as I know, this is the only book on publishing written by teens for teens.  As we adults know all too well, teenagers listen better to their peers than to us.  If your teenager wants to be a writer, by all means, get this book.  The Dunn sisters (who were 15 years old when they wrote this) draw on their own experiences to present a clear, no nonsense explanation of how the publishing process works.  They explain the do's and don'ts of getting into print, and the pitfalls to avoid when dealing with editors.  Readers of all ages will learn the usual things about cover letters, the all-important SASE (Self Addressed Stamped Envelope), some basic terminology that editors use, etc.  Plus, the Dunns give excellent tips on using professionalism (no cutsy stationery or fancy fonts, don't dot your i's with little hearts -- just use plain old-fashioned standard type styles, and never address the editor by his or her first name!)  These are the pitfalls that so many teens fall into, thinking that custy &quot;individuality&quot; and a &quot;chummy&quot; first-name basis will sell their work, when, in  fact, it just makes them look amateurish and gets their work rejected.<br />Speaking of rejection, the Dunns cover self-esteem issues, too, pointing out that even long-established professionals get piles of rejection slips, and this should not be taken personally.  O how right they are!  My first book, &quot;Beyond the Ashes,&quot; took five years to get into print --- I could have papered the walls with my rejection slips.  But once I found the right publisher, it was a &quot;go&quot; all the way, and the book has been in print continously for a decade.  So, as the authors of this book so rightly point out -- BE PATIENT and don't beat yourself up if your work gets rejected by an editor.<br />These knowledgeable authors also warn new writers about various publishing scams, such as poetry &quot;contests&quot; that are really just ways to sell you an overpriced anthology, or contests which charge entry fees that kids can't really afford and have little chance of winning anyway.  The Dunns recommend starting with your school publications and/or reputable children's magazines, and they list the ones that they've had success with.  You may not get paid much (or anything in some cases) by these pubs, but you will build up a portfolio of successes that can lead to professional writing jobs later.  (Most writers start this way. As Richard Bach once said, &quot;A professional writer is an amateur who never gave up.&quot;)<br />My only complaint about this book is that it's a bit thin for the price.  I realize they did it through a small press that probably doesn't have the capital of a large press, and short-run books are always costlier to produce.  Still, I hope they will consider expanding the book when they do a new edition.  As it is, the information itself is priceless.contests which charge entry fees that kids can't really afford and have little chance of winning anyway.

The first time I read this novel many years ago, I was unaware that the Human characters in 1860s Seattle were based on a 1960s TV show called &quot;Here Come the Brides.&quot;  I liked the novel in its own right, as a creative story about Spock getting lost in the Old Northwest.  More recently, I had a chance to view some of the &quot;Brides&quot; episodes on videotape, which acquainted me with the various characters.  Re-reading the novel was even more fun!<br />The basic plot premise is this:  During an espionage mission against the Klingons, Spock is captured and interrogated with the notorious Mind-Sifter, which gives him a case of total amnesia.  Before his capture, however, he manages to send two very short, cryptic messages about what the Klingons are up to.  The  Enterprise crew receives the messages, but it takes a while to decode them.<br />Meanwhile, Spock somehow ends up in the woods outside in 1860s Seattle, with no idea who he is or how he got there.  He is eventually found, wounded and unconscious, by Aaron Stemple (the lumber baron in the &quot;Brides&quot; series), who hides him in a remote cabin until he has recovered, then passes him off as his cousin Ishmael Marx.  (&quot;Ishmael&quot; gets shortened to &quot;Ish&quot; -- which just happens to mean &quot;male human being&quot; in Hebrew.  Nice touch!) Aaron knows that &quot;Ishmael&quot; is an alien, having seen his pointed ears and green blood, and expresses curiousity about where he came from.  But Spock does not remember, not even his own name.  Bits and pieces of images from his past crop up in his mind, but have no contextual meaning.  He accepts that he in a stranger in a strange land who is not likely to be rescued, and decides to pass for Human in order to survive.  With Aaron's help, he gradually adapts to life on Earth -- until the Klingons show up.<br />Whether or not you are familiar with &quot;Here come the Brides,&quot; the book is well-plotted and has some great scenes, such as Spock winning big in a gambling casino playing -- of all things -- chess!  Spock acts far more human than usual, until his memory comes back and he remembers what his mission is.  Of course, he  is eventually rescued by Kirk and company and returned to the 23rd century -- resulting in a little surprise at the end.pock winning big in a gambling casino playing -- of all things -- chess!

This book is different. It's a great collection of brief quotes by writers about writing, directed at fellow writers -- and anyone else who reads.  The illustrations are taken from old woodcuts and engravings, giving the little 142-page volume a satirically antique look, while the quotes themselves come from hundreds of famous writers, both classical and contemporary.  They (the quotes, and maybe the writers, too, for all I know) range from inspiring to cynical to downright absurd, but all of them will ring familiar to anybody who writes.  Some favorites:<br /><br />&quot;A book is like a garden carried in the pocket&quot; - Chinese proverb<br /><br />&quot;Books are a medium because they are neither rare nor well done&quot; -- Gore Vidal<br /><br />&quot;From the moment I picked up your book until I laid it down I  was convulsed with laughter.  Someday I intend reading it&quot; -- Groucho Marx, on S.J. Perleman's first book<br /><br />&quot;The only reason I didn't kill myself after I read the reviews of my first book was because we have two rivers in New York and I couldn't decide which one to jump into&quot; -- Wilfrid Sheed<br /><br />&quot;The didn't want it good, they wanted it Wednesday&quot; -- Robert Heinlein<br /><br />&quot;A  professional writer is an amateur who didn't quit&quot; -- Richard Bach<br /><br />&quot;All my major works have been written in prison...

I keep this book on my desk for those frustrating moments (minutes, hours, days, weeks....) when I find myself staring blankly at my keyboard.  Leafing through this book tickles my funnybone and reminds me that others before me have faced the same frustrations.

This excellent how-to book is cram-packed with practical suggestions on how to write good fiction.  Although it focuses primarily on science fiction and fantasy, the principles it explains are applicable to any type of creative writing.<br /><br />I especialy liked the chapters on consistency in world-building. In science fiction lingo, &quot;world building&quot; refers to the process of creating an alien culture.  In order to be convincing, that culture must make sense in terms of its ecology, history, technology, lifeforms, etc.  Doing this requires quite a bit of preliminary thought before you can even begin to write your novel, but that planning is absolutely necessary if your characters are to be believable.  For example, as Card points out, the type of space travel available to your characters will determine their attitudes about a lot of things. If a group of colonists arrived at their new planet in a multi-generational ship that took centuries to get there, they will be out of contact with the homeworld, and their culture will probably evolve independently.  On the other hand, if they can travel back and forth in a matter if days, they will be in close contact with (under the control of?) the homeworld, and your story will be quite different.  So, you have to make clear decisions about technology before you start writing.<br /><br />The same is true for the rules of magic, time travel, social customs, evolution of alien species, etc.  You, as the author, can decide what these rules will be, and there is a great deal of leeway in a lot of directions.  But once you make your rules, you must be consistent within the system you created.  Orson Scott Card takes you through this process step-by-step, using actual examples from his own and other SF novels.  This valuable lesson can be applied to any type of fiction.  What makes a good novel is the creation of a believable world that your readers can enter into with their imaginations --  and that requires pre-planned consistency.<br /><br />In fact, I found Card's book to be helpful in my own work with re-telling Hasidic stories for non-Hasidic readers. (cf. &quot;Jewish Tales of Reincarnation,&quot; available here on Amazon.)  These stories take place in a traditional Jewish culture that is as &quot;alien&quot; to most American readers as the fictional worlds in the SF genre.  Breaking into the general market meant explaining things in the Hasidic stories that I would normally take for granted.  Card's book got me thinking in a new way about the rules -- written and unwritten -- that form the framework of the Hasidic worldview.  Card taught me how to weave the necessary &quot;alien&quot; cultural info into my narratives so that my readers can understand that world and the people in it -- without falling into the deadly trap of preachy, boring prose.  That insight alone was well worth the price of the book -- and it contains much, much more.

It was written back in 1986, during the heyday of Trek novels, before things became so cookie-cutter formularized.  This book is thick enough (371 pages) to have multiple well-developed subplots in addition to the main storyline about the change of command from Captain Pike to Captain Kirk.  Although some reviewers see this as &quot;rambling,&quot; I see it as good writing, where seemingly unrelated threads all come together eventually.  (Perhaps my love of mystery novels makes me more tolerant than most when it comes to details that seem &quot;irrelevant&quot; until the end of the book.)<br /><br />The story features some interesting first-contact aliens, a variety of non-human crewmembers (pay special attention to the &quot;green roommate&quot;), a genetically engineered equiraptor (winged horse), a &quot;perverted&quot; Vulcan who seeks out emotional experiences for thrills, and a renegade Klingon from a minority Klingon culture where everyone veils their faces.  I especially enjoyed McIntyre's portrayal of the first interactions between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, as well as her great backstory about Yeoman Janice Rand.  As Gene Roddenberry himself said on the cover, &quot;I heartily recommend ENTERPRISE: THE FIRST ADVENTURE as a most creative and enjoyable tale of Star Trek's beginning...&quot;	2001-09-28

In her day, &quot;man&quot; was a true generic term meaning &quot;person&quot; or &quot;human being.&quot;  Many older English writings do indeed use &quot;man&quot; in this sense.  But, as this book explains, our language has changed, and this generic usage is no longer appropriate.  Problem is, many writers who grew up on the classics have internalized the outdated language of our literary ancestors. One of the reasons I bought this book was to learn how to update my writing style.<br /><br />The first chapter, &quot;Man as a False Generic,&quot; traces the history of gender usages in the English language.  This chapter did a great deal to help me personally overcome my initial negative reactions to &quot;feminist&quot; language by explaining how English has grown and evolved over the centuries.  For example, &quot;you&quot; was once a plural only (the singular being &quot;thou&quot;), and the use of &quot;they&quot; was once a legitimate generic singular pronoun.  Such classical writers as William Thackeray, George Eliot, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and even William Shakespeare used it regularly.  Only later, in the 18th century, did it go out of fashion.  Now it's back in style again, as a gender-free alternative to &quot;he.&quot; (Example: &quot;Each person can decide what they want.&quot;)<br /><br />What I like best about the Handbook is the way it uses actual examples (both good and bad) from published works to illustrate its points.  Especially interesting were the references from old grammar books, some of which were so absurdly outdated that I literally laughed out loud.  The authors then show how the various examples can be re-written with gender-free language without loss of clarity or style.<br /><br />To me as a writer, this down-to-earth approach was more convincing than the angry diatribes about &quot;Patriarchy&quot; which had previously turned me off to the whole gender issue.  If there's a problem with my writing, don't call me names, just show me how to fix it!  This book does that very well, explaining clearly and with good humor. I also appreciate the thesaurus in the back of the book, which serves as a quick reference for the most common gender-problem words.<br /><br />The one weakness of this book is that it skimps on religious language issues, which get only half a page.  The authors do correctly point out that the original text of the Bible uses feminine pronouns and imagery that got lost in translation, but there are no specific examples cited.  Nor does the Handbook give any of the genderless alternatives to &quot;The Lord&quot; (such as Ruler, Sovereign, Creator, Holy One, Blessed One, Heavenly Parent, etc.) now in use among Jews, Christians, and others.  Instead, the authors simply refer the reader to a bibliography in the back of the book.  But unless you happen to be a theologian, you are not likely to have those references handy when you need a quick synonym for &quot;The Lord.&quot;  Nor is &quot;The Lord&quot; included in the list of problem words in the Handbook's thesaurus, although &quot;Goddess&quot; does rate an entry as a no-no (as are all &quot;-ess&quot; words, according to this book).

In one of the Original Series episodes, there was an intergalactic library -- sort of like a Library of Congress for the galaxy.  That library was destroyed in TOS.  In Memory Prime, the library is rebuilt, using artificially-intelligent (AI) computers to store the info.  These AIs interact with the human librarians through electronic implants.  Problem is, the AIs get bored easily with their super-fast processing brains -- and therein lies the plot.<br /><br />Now, this MIGHT have been a really good book if the author had not gotten bogged down with so much technobabble -- pages and pages of it.  Yes, the AIs are bored and they play super-fast games among themselves -- that's all I need to know to understand the plot.  I do not need endless descriptions of how many nanoseconds this or that game takes to play or whatever.  Far more interesting would have been to find out something about all the fascinating cultural info stored at Memory Prime (which is what I thought the book was going to be about.).  Maybe it's because I'm a teacher, not a computer hack, but this book was very disappointing.	2001-08-31

This self-help book uses Star Trek characters and episodes as role models to help you develope your own skills and strengths. As the authors point out, many people are more familiar with the Trek characters than with classical mythology or other hero tales which served as role models in past generations. Using the Trek universe as an archetypal mythology for personal growth is a clever, fun way to get the message across. As Spock would say: Fascinating!<br /> According to the book, there are four basic types of heros: warriors, analyzers, relaters, and leaders. For each personality type, the book gives you examples from all the Star Trek shows (TOS, TNG, DS9 and VGR), then follows up with a visualization exercise in which you visit an imaginary holodeck and meet with the Trek characters, who serve as guides in your life.

Karin Blair, herself a Jungian, takes up the question of how characters in The Original Series (TOS) represent various Jungian archetypes in the human psyche.  Using specific episodes as examples, she explores authority, masculinity and femininity, inner dualities, outer opposites of good and evil, mind versus emotion, etc.  Leonard Nimoy said of this book that it is &quot;thorough, intelligent, and meaningful&quot; (cover blurb.)  According to Gene Roddenberry's biography (&quot;Star Trek Creator&quot;), the Great Bird was very impressed with it also -- which is what led me to track down a copy for myself.<br /> Especially interesting to me was Karin's analysis of the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triad as representing past (McCoy), present (Kirk), and future (Spock.) Although my own analysis differs considerably from hers (mine is based more on kabbalah than Jung), her thesis is carefully thought out and well-presented.  For many early Trek fans, Karin's POV became the lens through which they viewed the triad relationships, and it remains so for many Classic Trekkers today.<br /> Non-Jungians and modern feminists may balk at some of Karin's comments about the symbolism of women in classic Trek, especially the &quot;Monstrous Mother&quot; and &quot;Disposeable Female&quot; chapters.  But before you throw the book across the room, keep in mind that these are basic themes that occur in many classic mythologies around the world.  Star Trek, in turn, drew inspiration from these mythologies for many of its TOS episodes.  At the very least, Karin's analysis helps explain where some of these early Trek themes came from, and why they have such wide popularity.  (The section on the sex appeal of Spock among women will raise a few eyebrows!)  Dated or not, this book was a groundbreaking work in its time, and should be in the library of every serious Star Trek fan.an.	2001-08-21

It tells the story of the famous siege at Masada in well-written language, along with an account of the Yadin expedition that dug the archaeological site.  The account given by historian Josephus is compared with the findings at Masada itself as the story progresses. Surprisngly, Josephus proves to be far more accurate than was previously thought.  The book is copiously illustrated with black and white photographs of the artifacts and the archaologists who found them, along with models and classical art depicting Roman soldiers, buildings, etc.  (What I found amazing  was that so many artifacts had survived the centuries undisturbed -- right down to the skeleton of what may have been the last Zealot soldier.  Totally amazing!)  A very nice book and a good introduction to archaology for Jews and gentiles alike.	2001-08-14

Diane Duane has done an excellent job of developing the back history of the Romulan culture, explaining how and why they split off from the Vulcans at the time of Surak, etc. Her detailed description of the long generation-ship journey to the planet which would become known as Romulus is especially well done.  During this journey, the Rihannsu (which is what the Romulans call themselves) consciously changed their language and social structure to reject the logical way of Surak and become an old-new version of the warrior society that once existed on Vulcan. (I found myself wondering if Duane had patterned this history on certain aspects of modern Israeli culture, which has consciously rejected the pacifist philosophy of European Jewry to go back to the biblical warrior mode -- but that's a whole other story.)<br /> The plot itself takes place in the 23rd century, long after the Romulan-Vulcan split.  The Federation has lost contact with an undercover operative on Romulus, and now fears for her life.  Dr. McCoy is taken prisoner by the Romulans and ends up incarcerated at the same place where the Federation agent has infiltrated Romulan society and is passing for a household servant.  Now she must be very careful about acknowledging McCoy, lest she blow her cover and get them both killed.  Nahraht the Horta (a silicon-based lifeform who eats rock, and who also appears in several other Duane novels) plays an important, if at times humorous, role in the rescue of Dr. McCoy.  To tell you more would be a spoiler, so let me just say  that this book is one of the best reads in the TOS series.  It also sets the scene for a number of characters and events in future books by Diane Duane.	2001-08-01

It consists of responses by 38 prominent rabbis and theologians to five basic questions about the nature of Torah, Judaism, &quot;choseness,&quot; politics, and God.<br /> There are some heavy-duty names included here: Emil Fackenheim, Eliezer Berkovits, Eugene Borowitz, Mordechai Kaplan, Chaim Potok, Gunter Plaut, Zalman Schachter, Jacob Neusner, Herbert Weiner, Hershel Matt, Bernard Bamberger -- just to name a few.  That roster alone makes the book of historical significance.<br /> This is academic discussion, not &quot;inspirational&quot; or &quot;easy&quot; reading.  Modern readers may find some of the answers to be rather pedantic -- even boring -- in language style, but keep in mind the historical background against which this symposium was held.  One can clearly discern the burning issues of the 1960s, especially in the answers about the &quot;God is dead&quot; movement (which in itself is pretty dead today, but it was a big deal on campus back then.)  These responses were published during a time when American Jews were first moving out of ghettos and into the formerly all-white-gentile suburbs.  It was only two years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forced &quot;exclusive&quot; colleges and universities to open their doors to Jews, who then began to challenge the mostly Greco-Roman-Christian approaches to theology.  Then there was the anti-war movement, in which many young Jews were actively questioning the relevance, if any, of their own religion to political issues.  In short, Jews were encountering American society, and that society was encountering Jews, in a type of dialogue that had never happened before.  Multi-culturalism as we know it was still decades in the future, but the 1960s were definitely the beginning for Jews.<br /> The primary value of this book, in my opinion, is that it  provides a cross-section of Jewish thought during a crucial decade in American history.  It's also a type of bridge between the pre and post-WWII generations.  Included are well-established Jewish thinkers of the time, plus some newer thinkers who, over the next four decades, became leaders into the 21st century.  (Jewish Renewal people will find the &quot;early&quot; Zalman Schachter especially interesting).<br /> In short, this book is worth reading if you are interested in how American Jewish theology first confronted some major issues of the mid-20th century.  My only complaint is the high price of the current Jason-Aronson edition.  However, it did go through a number of mass-market paperback printings, so my advice would be to track down a used copy, or try the library.rucial decade in American history.

Although some animal rights people are against zoos of any kind, the fact is, today's zoos do a great deal to help save  endangered species through various breeding programs.  In some cases, such as the Pere David deer from China, the zoos have literally rescued species from extinction (see p. 218).  The author of this book does an excellent job of balancing biology with human interest stories, as he takes you behind the scenes and shares &quot;animal gossip&quot; about some of the zoo's most popular exhibits.  &quot;The Peaceable Kingdom&quot; follows a year's worth of zoo activities through the four seasons, and is simply cram-packed with zoology, history, geography, and odd facts about animals.

I suppose the marketing people felt that &quot;Bible&quot; would have a wider sales appeal or something.  Be that as it may, the most interesting thing about this book was the profound change in attitude that the journey brought to the writer himself. No, he didn't &quot;get religion&quot; and run off become an Orthodox Jew.  However, he did gain a new appreciation for the Bible stories themselves, as well as the various people and places that the Bible describes.<br /> By his own admission, Bruce Feiler was a secular/Reform Jew who started out simply wanting to connect to the physical places mentioned in the Torah, i.e., to literally walk where his ancestors had walked. At first, Feiler thought of the Bible as a sort of Baedekers travel guide.  He spent most of his preparation time reading history, geography, and archaeology.  Once he got on the road, however, he soon discovered that the Bible is also &quot;in the people&quot; (his words).  Whether they are true believers of many faiths or secularists who see the Bible as literature, the people who actually live in these biblical locations have a deep, almost mystical connection to the land itself -- a bond which goes beyond merely occupying a particular piece of real estate.  Feiler grew to have this inner experience, too.  As he himself explains, somewhere along the line he stopped thinking of The Book as a travel guide, and started seeing it as The Bible.<br /> Feiler's prose style is both creative and highly readable.  While some have criticized his incessant junk food metaphors (chocolate mountains, cinnamon hills -- he was getting hungry maybe?), I found them rather amusing.  On the one hand, here he is, talking about places mentioned in a Holy Book that is sacred to millions of people.  On the other hand, he doesn't pontificate, nor does he idealize.  He duly notes the the rampant commercialism at holy sites and, with a wry sense of humor, he comments on many strange justapositions of traditional and modern life.  (The fire extinguisher kept near the &quot;true burning bush&quot; in St. Catherine's monastery on Mt. Sinai had me laughing out loud.  Was the burning bush was expected to catch on fire?)<br /> As with most personal travelogues, there are things in this one that Feiler doesn't get right, even with his famous tour guide, Israeli archaeologist Avner Goren.  (Who, by the way, was paid by Feiler to do this project, but so what?  Hiring a guide is a time-honored travel practice, and more than one scholar has financed his research with moonlighting.)

Its author, Harry M. Olinsky, was Professor of Bible at Hebrew Union College (Reform) at the time it was first published in 1969.<br />The book is a set of detailed footnotes explaining some of the more tricky and/or cotroversial translation choices.  It opens with a 40-page introduction tracing the history of Bible translations and a discussion of Jewish translations in particular, then goes on to give a verse-by-verse commentary on the sources used for the NJV translation of the Torah (which, for non-Jews reading this, is the same thing as the first five books of the Bible.)<br /> Definitely a scholarly work, this would be of help to anyone  interested in Bible translations.  Non-Jews should be aware, hoowever, that the Hebrew language authorities cited here are primarily Jewish commentators, and the book assumes you already know who scholars like Rashi, Rambam, and Ibn Ezra are.  It also assumes you know some Hebrew (the terms discussed are transliterated into the Roman alphabet.) But even if you don't have that background, you will probably find the discussions themselves to be of considerable interest.	2001-07-18

In the &quot;Executive Summary&quot; preface to his book, Gips explains the four criteria that he and his org consider to be necessary for &quot;sustainable agriculture&quot;: 1) ecological soundness; 2) economic viability; 3) social justice (equitable distribution of power and goods); and 4) humaneness (in the treatment of both animals and humans.) This is followed by a summary of highlights about the 12 pesticides covered in the following chapters.<br /> The basic philosophy of the book is based on Integrated Pest Mamagement (IPM), which uses a combination of tactics, such a releasing beneficial predator insects, developing resistant plant varieties, practicing crop rotation and timed plantings, etc.  Chemical pesticides, Gips says, should be used only as a last resort, not the first line of defense.<br /> The chapters themselves cover these topics in more depth, with copious footnotes and examples of successes throughout the world.  Chapters 1-3 cover the history of pest control and the development of IPM; chapters 4-15 cover the &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; pesticides and their IPM alternatives; Chapter 16 gives some recommendations for political action, and the rest of the book has almost 100 pages of reference materials, including a very helpful glossary. All in all, this book brings a LOT of info on pesticides together in one place.<br /> The material is, of necessity, technical in places, but the writing style is easy to read, making this a very accessible book for the average person.  Although it is primarily aimed at commercial agriculture, it can also be useful for small farmer or organic gardeners, as well as anyone interested in ecological issues.	2001-07-11

Back in the 1980s when her symptoms appeared, the doctors kept diagnosing her reactions as &quot;psychosomatic&quot; because they did not produce identifiable allergens like regular allergies do.  This book, published in 1985, was one of the first proofs we found that A) she was not alone and B) it was not &quot;all in her head.&quot;<br /> Elizabeth Rose's story, told in a non-technical, almost journal-like style, chronicles her struggle to identify the chemicals in her home and environment that were causing the allergic reactions, then de-toxify her system enough to recover a reasonably normal life.  Much additional research has been done on Environmental Illness and Sick Building Syndrome since this book was first published, but it remains a good read.  In addition to practical info on identifying harmful chemical factors, she also shares some of the spiritual side of her healing, such as various dreams that gave her clues about what she needed to do.  Most of all, her story offers hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel.	2001-07-11

St. Louis, which carried 937 Jews who were fleeing Hitler.  They hoped for freedom, but found only disappointment and, in some cases, death.  The St. Louis made it safely Cuba, but the passengers were turned away under the influence of Hitler's anti-Jewish propaganda.  Next, they sailed for the Florida Coast, only to be refused entry into the USA because of immigration quotas.  For weeks the St. Louis sailed up and down the coast while Congress debated whether to make an exception and let them in.  In the end, even a plea from President Roosevelt could not open America's doors to these refugees. The St.Louis was sent back to Europe, where her passengers were dispersed to France, Belgium, Great Britain, and the Netherlands.  Some perished in Hitler's concentration camps.  Others lived to tell the story.<br /> This tragic event remains an ugly blot on America's past, and is one of the reasons for the &quot;Law of Return&quot; in modern Israel (which allows any Jew who is fleeing persecution in any country to enter Israel immediately upon arrival with no hassles.)  It is also the reason that Israel was the first country in the world to grant political asylum to Vietnamese &quot;boat people&quot; fleeing the Communist regime at the end of the Vietnam War. The story also had an effect on America's current immigration laws, which make better provisions for granting asylum.<br /> &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; was first published in 1974 and became an instant bestseller.  It was made into a movie in 1977, and won three Academy Award nominations.  It went through a number of  printings, and was re-issued in 1994 as  a fine &quot;coffee-table&quot; hardcover with 300 pictures, including reproductions of tickets, telegrams, passports, menus, newspaper articles, official documents, etc. as well as photos of the crew and passengers.

The rest of the tales in this anthology are copyrighted 1998, same year as  the book came out, which suggests they are new tales written especially for Midnight Louie's collection.<br /> In each story, one or more animals plays a role in solving a mystery. In some cases, the animal itself is the detective, while in others, the animal provides a vital clue for his or her dumb humans.  Not only dogs and cats, but also elephants, raccoons, an opossom, a lovebird, a robin, a half-wolf and a Tasmanian Devil take their turn at sleuthing here.<br />  Some favorites:  In &quot;Daisy and the Silver Quaitsch,&quot; the neighborhood dogs literally dig up clues to tip off their clueless masters.  &quot;Kittens Take Detection 101,&quot; introduces us to two young cats (who don't even know how to use capital letters yet!) who find a dead body while sneaking out to explore their neighborhood.  In &quot;Final Vows,&quot; cats literally do have nine lives (or more!), and the feline detective, Colonel Mustard, returns from the dead to discover who poisoned him and help save the rest of the neighboorhood cats from the same fate.  &quot;On the Take&quot; features a soft-hearted cop who finds a unique way to place stray cats in good homes.  (If I lean toward the cat and dog stories, maybe it's because I have three dogs and ten cats.  But the Tasmanian Devil get his due here, too, when a careless bomber sets off a charge near his cage, and &quot;A Hamster of No Importance&quot; solves a series of high-society Jewel thefts.)<br /> Each story has an introduction by Midnight Louie, the feline detective created by Carole Nelson Douglas (who also happens to be the editor of this book.)

Like all such reference books, the purpose of this one is to help you keep track of all the various characters and places from previous stories that might be mentioned in passing during sequels, etc.  It doesn't give you a whole lot of new info, but it does help organize what you already know about the world of Qwilleran and his two amazing Siamese. Of course, if you haven't read all the episodes yet, then the synopses could be real spoilers for these whodunits.  In that case, the solution is very simple: refrain from reading the summaries until you've read the original book(s) first!  (Duh.

This Haggadah (Passover liturgy) was one of the first (if not THE first) to create a seder that focuses on vegetarianism and animal rights.  The author does a nice job of examining the horrible conditions that animals live under in modern factory farms, and compares that to the oppression of slavery in Egypt. In this area, the Liberated Lamb does very well, and gives us much to think about.<br />However, the Haggadah fails in the same area where many such alternative liturgies fail, namely, liturgical requirements. While there can be a great deal of leeway in re-telling the Exodus story on Passover, certain elements MUST be there, or the seder ceremony is not kosher. One absolute requirement is that the celebrants must mention three things: Matzah, Maror, and Pesach. &quot;Pesach&quot; refers to the lamb sacrifice -- which this haggadah never mentions at all, not even to condemn it.  My sense is, that Ms. Kalechovsky was so offended by the very idea of sacrificing a lamb, that she preferred to excise the idea completely. Unfortunately, that omission renders the entire seder incomplete -- if this is the only text being used. For that, I'm docking it a star.<br />Still, there is some very good material here.  My recommendation would be to use &quot;Haggadah for the Liberated Lamb&quot; as a source book for supplementary readings around the seder table, but use a more traditional text to actually lead the seder itself.	2001-04-26

Sinai.)  According to kabbalah, each of the seven weeks in the Omer period corresponds to one of God's holy attributes on the Kabbalistic Tree diagram.  In turn, each of the seven days within that week also corresponds to one of those same attributes.  7 x 7 = 49, resulting in 49 permutations of God's attributes which we, in turn, are supposed to reflect in our daily lives.<br /> What Rabbi Jacobson has done is create 49 lessons for &quot;chesbon ha-nefesh&quot; (literally, &quot;reckoning of the soul&quot;, i.e., taking personal inventory) to be used as a daily practice during the omer period.  There's one lesson for each day of the omer, based on that day's combination of attibutes.  In short, it's very similar to my own &quot;49 GATES OF LIGHT&quot; omer counting program that I wrote back in the 1980s (now out of print as a physical book but still available as an interactive ebook.)<br /> Where Rabbi Jacobson's book differs from mine is that, while mine uses a lot of storytelling, his lessons are more like pop psychology, focusing on personal behaviors and attitudes toward myself and others (&quot;Do I love enough?&quot; &quot;Do I practice self-discipline?&quot; , etc.)  Mine is also somewhat &quot;new age&quot; in style (although still kosher), while his is written in a more mainstream format that can be used by very traditional Jews (the person who gave me my copy is a Satmar Hasidic rabbi) as well as those who may be counting the omer for the first time, and everyone in between.<br /> The one big complaint I have about Rabbi Jacobson's version is that it does not have an illustration of the &quot;Tree within a Tree&quot; diagram upon which this whole process is based.  Although there is a diagram of the lower seven sefirot on the front cover, people who are not already familiar with kabbalah and the Tree diagram might not &quot;get it&quot; right away.  For that omission, I'm docking it a star, because, in my experience, most people want to understand the theory behind the practice.<br />  The book itself is in a narrow spiral-bound format with the wire  binding at the top, making it possible to have it lie flat on your desk like a daily calendar, or you can tuck it in a purse or coat pocket. (It reminded me somewhat of that notebook that Columbo the detective carries around).  Each lesson is on a separate page, blank on the back, so you have room to journal and take notes.

This book makes my &quot;Dreck of Trek&quot; list for its absolutely abominable &quot;Messiah&quot; ideas that are based on negative stereotypes of Mohammed and Islam that will make modern Muslims cringe -- yet another &quot;let's make Spock act totally out of character&quot; story.

Ms. Dusty Sklar, the author of this book, was not the first to discover a link between occultism and Nazism.  She was, however, the first to take the subject seriously and do an in-depth scholarly study.  The result was this work, which first came out back in 1977 and is still an interesting read today.<br /> While it is well-known that Hitler consulted with astrologers, most readers will be astounded at some of the really strange cults that flourished  --  and heavily influenced -- the Third Reich.  For example, there was Hans Hoerbiger, a pseudo-scientist who believed that the universe was founded on an eternal battle between fire and ice.  His influence was the reason that Hilter sent his troops into Russia so ill-equipped for the cold, expecting that his soldiers of fire would cause the winter snow to melt away before their marching feet.  (It they didn't, and thousands of Germans froze to death.  See p. 80)<br /> Then there were the Hollow Earthers, who thought that Nordic giants lived in the center of our planet.  Occult lodges like the Thule society (of which Hitler was an initiate) also flourished, espousing weird forms of social Darwinism and racial theories that seem laughable today, but which led to the extermination of millions of Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals and others.  Even Karl Jung eventually got into the act, writing a series of antisemitic pronouncements about &quot;Jewish psychology&quot; that, among other things, branded Freud's psychoanalytic theories as a &quot;satanic&quot; doctrine capable of &quot;murdering souls&quot;(see p. 138).  Jung's antisemitism is swept under the rug today, but remain a blot on the history of Jungian thought.  In short, the Third Reich was based, not on the rational science for which Germany is famous, but on a hodge-podge of neo-pagan superstitions.<br /> This is not to say that all occult teachings lead to Nazism, or that all &quot;New Age&quot; movements are antisemitic.  There are genuine forms of spirituality that nourish the mind and soul in positive ways, affirming the oneness of humankind.  At the same time, as this book amply demonstrates, the true seeker must be careful not to be seduced by the Dark Side of the Force.  This book should be read -- as a warning -- by every serious student of esoteric philosophy.that nourish the mind and soul in positive ways, affirming the oneness of humankind.

The reason this book is out of print (and so few fans have read it) is because it was yanked off the market for being &quot;in bad taste&quot; around the time that Roddenberry began cracking down on Trek novels that he personally didn't like. (In the mid-1980s. See chapter 17 of his biography, &quot;Star Trek Creator,&quot; for more on that aspect of Trek history.)  At any rate, the very idea of a censored Star Trek novel was so intriguing to me, I just had to track down a copy and read it!<br /> The plot opens with a number of Enterprise crewpersons having some very disturbing dreams.  In the case of Kirk and Spock, they both have the same dream, in which Spock is captain of a starship that's not the Enterprise, and Kirk is a young ensign aboard that  same ship. As it turns out, the dreams are really bleed-throughs from another universe that was created by Romulan time-tampering.  The Romulans, in an attempt to go back and change history in a way that would eliminate the Federation, have created Second History -- and it's not stable.  On a deep subconscious level, many people in Second History are still linked to First History (the original timeline) and, in cases where their roles are not the same in both worlds, the disparity is causing insanity.  And its spreading.  If the original timeline is not restored soon, the whole universe is in danger of going mad.<br /> What might be offensive to some people is that Ensign Kirk of Second History is a pretty messed-up character.  He's a bitter young man who gets into fights with other crewmembers, has spent some time in prison (although, it is pointed out, the evidence used to convict him was was circumstantial and he maintains his innocence), and was drafted into the Fleet against his will. (The draft is one of the differences that Second History introduces.)  He's also misusing a dream suppressant drug to try and stop the nightmares.  This is certainly not the way we want to see Our Hero portrayed -- but then again, it fits the plot.  I mean, if the Romulans really want to put the Federation out of commission, wouldn't it make sense to get the highly-competent James T. Kirk out of the picture?  Besides, we've seen Kirk acting &quot;weird&quot; before under various alien influences, so why would this scenario be any worse?  There's also an element of &quot;there but for the grace of God go I&quot; in this story, making us realize that, given the wrong circumstances, anybody's life can take a bad turn.  And it can also be righted again.<br /> Eventually, the Second History versions of Kirk and Spock figure out what's happened.  (A nice touch is that this is accomplished by a mindmeld that taps into the deep friendship between them in First History, which still links them on the subconscious level.) Ensign Kirk quits the drug cold turkey, gets his life together, and helps Spock try to figure out a way to save the universe.  To tell you any more would be a spoiler, except to say that this book is well worth reading --- that is, if you can find a copy.it fits the plot.

Surfing Rabbi?  If that sounds like an oxymoron to you, then you really should read this book.  It's the totally honest personal story of a 1960's Malibu beach rat whose love of surf and sand eventually became a spiritual quest to delve more deeply into the power of his own Jewish roots.  Today, he is both a Hasidic rabbi and avid surfer, demonstrating that to be a &quot;religious Jew&quot; does not have to mean withdrawing from the modern world.<br /> I read this book on a cold, snowy, Minnesota Sabbath afternoon, which is about as far away from the ocean as a person can get.  I knew nothing about surfing when I opened the book, but soon found myself completely caught up in the story.  Here was a man so devoted to surfing, that he drove through a war zone just to get to the beach.  Foolhardy or adventurous?  I had to find out!<br /> Rabbi Shifrin writes in a clear, personal style, so that even a landlubber like me can easily picture the beaches and surfer culture that he describes.  Not that every scene comes out of &quot;Endless Summer.&quot;  Shifrin's first attempt to catch a wave at Malibu was a dangerous disaster that knocked his fantasies down to earth -- but also spurred him on to master this most challenging of sports.  He became an expert surfer, lifeguard, and triathelete, so totally focused on riding the waves that he had little time for anything else in his life.  Still, something was missing.  The quest to fill that void eventually led him back to his Jewish roots and on to rabbinic ordination, where he learned that Judaism, like the ocean, is deep beyond imagining.<br /> Today, Shifrin uses surfing as a form of youth outreach, and is known worldwide as &quot;The Surfing Rabbi.&quot;  His life, in the words of surf film producer Ira Opper, is about &quot;riding the energy of the universe.&quot;  Gentiles and Jews alike will find inspiration in this fascinating story.ke will find inspiration in this fascinating story.	2001-02-23

I'm not a fan of martial arts or action video games, so I found it hard to figure out exactly what was going on at first.  However, because I am currently reading all the early Trek novels in search of possibly Jewish characters (for a research project), I made myself continue reading, even though I expected the book to be a slog.  Boy, was I wrong! The game in Chapter 1 turned out to be the template for understanding the whole book, which is as tightly-plotted as a Grand Master chess game -- and then some.<br /> Other reviewers have given excellent synopses of the story, so I won't reinvent the wheel.  I'll just point out some interesting trivia, such as a brief appearance by Leonard McCoy's grandfather (the book is a prequel, with Leonard himself a mere babe in diapers at the time), and a meeting between young Spock and the Klingon Captain Krenn, who play a game of chess together.  Also of interest is the fact that the &quot;Imperial Race&quot; of Klingons in this book have ridged or knobbed foreheads.  Remember, the book was published in 1984, three years before we saw Worf's ridges in NextGen.  Klingons in this book also do not cry, and apparently have no tear ducts, since Krenn takes special note of this in Humans.  Although tearless Klingons did not become &quot;canonical&quot; until the Star Trek VI movie, the idea was obviously invented by Ford here. My point being, that this novel is an important source for a lot of things about the Klingon culture.<br /> And oh yes -- there is a Jewish character, too: Colonel Jael Rabinowich, assigned to security for Captain Krenn's delegation to a Babel conference on earth.  Oh sure, the word &quot;Jewish&quot; is never actually used, but with a name like Rabinowich, what else can she be?  She's described as coming from a long line of warriors in what could be the Middle East.  But the real clincher is that she bids Captain Krenn &quot;Shalom aleichem&quot; to which the Klingon replies, &quot;Aleichem sholom&quot;! (see page 143.)Middle East.

The book has a universal appeal and a very good message, even if you're not a Trekkie or an SF fan.  In my opinion, it could even be used as outside reading for a course in multiculturism.  The way Kagan's characters handle each other's differences certainly beats some of the, er, shall we say, less-than-successful &quot;first contacts&quot; I've experienced as a Hasidic Jew living in rural Minnesota, where &quot;that's different&quot; is local codespeak for disapproval.  We can all learn a lot about mutual respect from this book, where both sides discuss what their behavioral &quot;norms&quot; and expectations are.  As Stiff Tail explains to her humanoid visitors, there is no &quot;of course&quot; when it comes to local customs.<br /> Although the main plot is about finding a cure for a devastating plague that is killing both Eaouans and humans, the real strength of this story lies in the exchange of ideas, songs, customs (and sometimes taboos) between the Enterprise crew and the cat-like alien beings on the planet Sivao.  Being a cat lover myself, I found Kagan's portrayal of the felinoid culture to be internally consistent and believably grounded in the real behaviors of cats.  Feline characters have appeared in Trek before (such as crewperson M'ress in the animated series, and Snarl, who also makes an appearance here), but this was the first book to explore the cultural possibilities in any depth.  Because this novel came relatively early in the Trek series (it's only #21 in a list of hundreds), it helped set a high standard for IDIC in future stories about alien societies.<br /> I also liked the central role that Uhura plays in this story.  In the Original Series, she sang in a number of episodes, setting the scene for her musical accomplishments in this tale.  Having learned certain &quot;secret&quot; songs from her Eaouan friend, Sunfall of-Ennien, Uhura discovers clues in the ancient ballads that lead the crew to Sivao, the original homeworld of Sunfall's ancestors.  There, Uhura is honored as a bard for her singing abilities, and this leads to another private song-swap with the local bard.  Not only does this exchange help solve the puzzle of the origins of the plague, it fulfills a healing prophecy as well.  To tell you any more would ruin a very good read.

Whether you're a Democrat, Republican, third party member, independent or undecided, this book has a great deal to recommend it.  It should be required reading for anyone considering a career in politics, and for citizens who want an accessible account of what the life of a modern politican is like.<br /> Senator Lieberman begins by explaining that &quot;career politician&quot;  -- a term so often seen as negative -- does not have to mean someone who is entrenched in graft and dishonesty.  Just as professionals in other fields have a responsibility to uphold the  very best standards of their professions, so do politicians.  Lieberman considers politics to be his chosen career, the same as a doctor, lawyer, teacher, or other professional.  He strives to do his job with a strong sense of moral responsibility, fully aware that public life is, well, public.  He writes: &quot;I assume that everything I do in my life -- EVERYTHING -- could possibly become public and therefore I should not do anything privately that I could not justify publicly.&quot; (p. 51)<br /> The Senator's arguments in favor of politics as a bona fide career also changed my own stance on term limits.  Before reading this book, I thought term limits were a good idea, as a way to prevent bad politicians from becoming entrenched.  But, as Senator Lieberman eloquently points out, running a country is a big responsibility that takes years of experience.  Having a large portion of the  Senate turn over every few years would be inefficent, because everybody would be relatively new to the job.  Besides, Lieberman points out, we already have ways to remove bad politicians.  They're called elections.<br /> As a religious Jew, I also appreciated the Senator's openness about the role that religion plays in his life.  There have been other Jewish politicians in high offices, but none, so far as I know, have been as open as Lieberman about their beliefs.  All too often, American Jews are reluctant to discuss religion in public, giving the false impression that we don't believe in anything. Senator Lieberman brings some balance to this issue, while educating the public about Judaism in the process. When, for example, he was asked by the press, &quot;How do you relax?&quot; his answer was, &quot;The Sabbath.&quot;  This book he gives a good picture of how he balances Sabbath observance with carrying out his public duties.  During national emergencies such as the Persian Gulf War, he votes on the Sabbath, under the principle of temporarily setting aside the Sabbath prohibitions in order to save lives.  (For the benefit of Lieberman critics who ask &quot;How can he be revere life and support abortion rights,&quot; let me point out that Jewish law permits and even requires abortion under certain circumstances, and these differ from the Roman Catholic stance.  Those who are interested in further details should read David M. Feldman's book, &quot;Marital Relations, Birth Control, and Abortion in Jewish Law,&quot; which I have reviewed here on Amazon.)<br />  In conclusion: I heard Senator Lieberman speak at a rally in Duluth during the Presidential campaign, and was very impressed with him, both as an eloquent speaker and a mentsch -- that wonderful Yiddish word that his campaign added to our national vocabulary, meaning &quot;a fine human being&quot;. Our government could use a lot more politicians like him -- whatever their party affiliations.

But Chelm foolishness is not mere stupidity -- no, indeed! The &quot;wisdom&quot; of Chelm is a sort of convoluted mis-logic that satirizes the process of Jewish theological reasoning.  It's a way that we Jews have of laughing at ourselves, of stepping back and saying, &quot;Sometimes we make  things far more complicated than they need to be.&quot;<br /> In this book, Rabbi Nachman of Chelm tells Mendel to set up the  menorah by the window for the first night of Chanukah.  Mendel goes to the storeroom, where there are such silly things as a bike with square wheels, a crate full of imported air, and the Cantor's Decanter.  In this messy jumble he finds a menorah and  brings it into the main room.  Following the rabbi's instructions quite literally, he sets it up by the window -- on the floor!  The Rabbi tells him to get a table.  Mendel goes back into the storeroom but, in true Chelmitish denseness, doesn't see the little table where he found the menorah in the first place.  So, he tells the rabbi that he can't find a table. The rabbi then sends him to Berel the carpenter, who is busy trying to remember which end of a ladder is the top...  and the silliness just goes on from there.<br /> In addition to the main storyline, there are puns and jokes in the illustrations.  Characters talk to each other with cartoon-type balloons (&quot;How long did you sleep last night?&quot;  &quot;I don't know, I didn't bring a ruler to bed.&quot;) and the synagogue cat makes wisecracks.  Berel's shop is named &quot;Tables Are Us&quot; (established &quot;some time ago&quot;), where there is a currently a big sale on two-legged tables.  Best of all, the sign on the road to Chelm points in both directions -- hinting that EVERYWHERE is Chelm, when you stop to think about it.<br /> In terms of Jewish tradition, the illustrations are appropriate for even very Orthodox Jews.  One nice touch is that the menorah is the oil-burning type, rather than one with candles -- which would be accurate for Old World Chelm and in many homes to this day.  Candles were expensive back then (out of reach for the poor Chelmites) and oil was/is preferred to commemorate the Miracle of the Oil.  Having a cat in the synagogue is historially accurate, too -- she helped keep the mice from nibbling the leather bindings on the books.  (Those were, of course, always synagogue mice, never church mice.)ce touch is that the menorah is the oil-burning type, rather than one with candles -- which would be accurate for Old World Chelm and in many homes to this day.

This is a fine collection of Jewish children's stories, intended  to bring a greater level of multiculturalism into the Waldorf educational system.  In recent years, the Waldorf schools have been accused of racism, primarily because some of their older curriculum is rather Eurocentric. (The system originated in Central Europe.) This book, the first in an upcoming series, helps correct that problem, by drawing upon the rich treasury of Jewish folktales.  Future volumes will include collections from African, Chinese, and Native American folklore, providing Waldorf teachers (and others) with materials that are inclusive of the vast diversity of cultures on our planet.  For this noble effort, I say &quot;Yashar koach!&quot; (the Jewish equivalent of &quot;Bravo!&quot;)<br /> The book also includes a nice overview of Waldorf theory on how different types of stories appeal to different age groups, and how fantasy in general helps a child to internalize moral, ethical, and spiritual values.  Athough I'm not a Waldorf teacher, I found this section to be very helpful.  The stories themselves are arranged according to this system, making it very easy to choose age-appropriate material for different groups.  I was especially pleased to see some animal stories included, because these are often overlooked in other Jewish anthologies.<br /> My only complaint is that some of the illustrations are not Jewishly authentic, drawing more on the conventions of Christian Sunday school art.  The bare-headed Moses is a case in point. Charlton Heston may have played him that way, but Jewish illustrators do not show our prophets with bare heads, because  covering the head is a sign of respect and humility before God.  Ditto for the bare-headed men in &quot;The Witches of Ashkelon.&quot; (Tell me, dear reader -- would Hasidim volunteer to accompany their saintly rabbi on a dangerous mission to confront evil with heads uncovered?) Plus, the Jewish image of Heaven is not angels on clouds, as portrayed on page 174.  It's the Great Banquet under the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden, where the saints feast, sing, and learn Torah together in round-table discussions, not by reading books alone! (BTW, the very word &quot;Paradise&quot; is derived from Hebrew &quot;Pardes&quot; which means &quot;garden.&quot;) Last but not least, none of the Jewish males in this book are wearing ritual fringes, and the robes are not belted (both required by Jewish law.)<br /> Most Jews will probably forgive these oversights, although I, for one, would prefer that children (and their teachers) who read these stories should be exposed to more authentic images of us, because such imagery, acquired in childhood, is often carried for life.  So, for the bloopers, I'm docking it a star.  Still, the illustrations are beautiful artwork, and they do evoke a sense of fairytale fantasy.  However, if the series is to succeed as a mulicultural tool, then the illustrator(s) need to research the various cultures more carefully, because members of those cultures will check the accuracy of details.  (Native Americans, for example, have specific costumes, styles of housing, beadwork patterns, clothes, hair, types of feathers worn, etc. for each different tribe.  Generic teepees and headresses simply will not do!) Still, this book is a definite step in the right direction.

My first impression agreed with hers -- until I saw that it was written by Jeffrey Mishlove, whom I personally know and respect. &quot;What's Jeffrey up to this time?&quot; I wondered.<br />  Ted Owens, who called himself &quot;The PK Man&quot; (PK = psychokinesis, mind-over-matter), was a flamboyant, controversial figure in the ufology community, who died back in 1987.  During his lifetime, Owens predicted a wide variety of storms, plane crashes, and other disasters.  He claimed to do this through mental contact with UFOs and non-corporeal beings that he called &quot;Space Intelligences.&quot;  Because he wanted Dr. Mishlove to write his biography, Owens regularly sent him copies of the predictions, along with clippings about events that he felt were fulfillments.  The result is the worlds's largest collection of material on Ted Owens, which formed the database for this book.<br /> The first manuscript was written back in 1979, but publication was delayed for a number of reasons, not the least of which was Mishlove's worry that the book would affect his own credibility.  Had Owens merely predicted these events, there would have been no problem, since studies on precognition are considered legitimate in psi circles.  But psychokinesis is another matter.  Owens claimed that he actually CAUSED all those hurricanes, floods, snowstorms, plane crashes --- even the eruption of Mt. St. Helens (which, according to Owens, was a mind experiment gone wrong!)  A book on a man who claims to control the weather through contact with UFOs sounds more than a little, well, uh -- crazy.<br /> Personally, I don't believe Owens actually controlled the weather.  He did however, seem to have had psychic abilities from an early age.  It's possible that he was able to sense upcoming weather patterns, which he then exploited for his own ends.  Whenever he gave his predictions, he (not the researchers) chose the time and nature of the events, within a rather large time frame -- usually 90 days or, in some cases, as much as a year.  In that much time, a lot can happen naturally.  However, there does not seem to be any indication of conscious fraud. Owens sincerely believed he had the power and, over the years, there were enough weird coincidences to reinforce that belief.<br /> Let us assume, just for the sake of argument, that Owens WAS causing these events through PK.  We are then faced with yet another problem, namely, the moral character of a man who would purposely bring disasters just to prove that he could.  Owens seems to have had a very fragile ego, becoming angry and later embittered when the world didn't hail him as a great psychic. Although he sometimes compared himself to Moses and the Ten Plagues, a better analogy would be the sorcerer Balaam, who was hired by King Balak to curse the Jews (see Numbers 22-24.) Moses was seeking to free his people from slavery, not glorify himself.  Jewish commentaries agree that, had Pharoah let the Jews go in the beginning, the Plagues would never have happened.  Balaam, on the other hand, was a magician-for-hire who would put curses on one's enemies for the right price.  Moses served God for a higher purpose, but Balaam went to the highest bidder.<br /> Ted Owens exhibited many Balaam-like behaviors, attempting on several occasions to contract with sports teams to put the hex on their opponents, in return for a hefty fee.  When he was turned down, he then cursed the refusing team instead.  Similarly, he claimed to have caused a destructive storm in Cleveland in retaliation for people not coming to his lectures there.  These are not the motivations of a Moses, but they do fit those of a Balaam.  On many occasions, Owens claimed to work disasters for no other reason than personal revenge.<br /> Dr. Mishlove expresses serious concern about Owens' lack of moral responsibity, even calling one chapter &quot;The Dark Side of the Force.&quot;  But, being a scientist with a certain distrust of organized religion, he is reluctant to make value judgements about &quot;black magic.&quot;  I have no such qualms.  As a Jewish theologian, I don't believe in the Christian forms of &quot;satanism,&quot; but I do believe there are negative powers and entities out there.  Whether or not Owens actually had the power he claimed, he often set out with specific intent to do harm at the bidding of his UFO entities, and that suggests demonic posssession.  Judaism long ago recognized that psychic ability is not synonymous with spirituality, and one should &quot;test every spirit.&quot;  Even shamanic cultures recognize that a shaman can go bad.  This is precisely why mystical disciplines the world over insist that their initiates go through a long period of rigorous training, in order to subjugate the ego to the higher laws of moral responsibility -- a form of training that Owens did not have.  Whoever or whatever those &quot;Space Intelligences&quot; might have been, they chose poorly when they picked Owens as their representative. Owens, on the other hand, might have done better to refuse the &quot;gifts&quot; of such capricious entities, who, even if they did come from another dimemsion, seems to have little love for the people of Earth.  In the end, Owens became a broken man whom few took seriously, the object of much ridicule and scorn.<br /> I gave this book four stars for being well-written and researched, even though I found much of it to be utterly preposterous.  Still, it was a compelling and sometimes chilling read, raising many questions about the sometimes-fuzzy boundaries between mysticism, possession, and mental illness.  At the very least, it can serve as a warning, clearly demonstrating what happens to those who choose the Dark Side, whether it be that of the UFOs or their own minds.ral responsibity, even calling one chapter &quot;The Dark Side of the Force.&quot;  But, being a scientist with a certain distrust of organized religion, he is reluctant to make value judgements about &quot;black magic.&quot;  I have no such qualms.

US	52499409	R3Q9CJ61HPQ1XJ	1568212429	173579486	Hasidic Williamsburg: A Contemporary American Hasidic Community	Books	5	35	37	N	N	Exellent study of the Satmar community	To the average New Yorker, the Satmar Hasidim seem like a mysterious anachronism, with their long black coats, hats, and beards.  To the mainstream Jewish community, they are reviled for being anti-Zionist and not supporting Israel.  Yet there is so much more to this traditional Jewish culture.  Here is a people who have managed to become successful in America without assimilating into the dominant culture's melting pot.  George Kranzler takes you behind the scenes into this community, to explore its religion, sociology, politics, and economics.<br /> The book is really a follow-up to Kranzler's earlier 1961 work, &quot;Williamsburg: A Jewish Community in Transition,&quot; in which he predicted the eventual decline of the neighborhood and the loss of the Hasidic culture there.  Happily, Kranzler was wrong.  The Hasidim not only survived, they flourished and prospered.  Today, Satmar Hasidim in the Williamsburg neighborhood number in the tens of thousands.<br /> The book contains a great deal of first-person material quoted directly from the Hasidim themselves, and is especially valuable for its positive chapter on the communal contributions of the Hasidic women.  Contrary to the negative stereotypes, the Satmar women are not wimpy dishrags with no rights.  No indeed! These are strong, assertive women, who choose to be Hasidic, and who take great pride in their roles as wives, mothers, charity workers, etc.  Hasidic culture strongly centers on the home, elevating the womens' roles to extreme importance in passing down the traditions to future generations.  In addition, many Satmar women have their own successful businesses, actively contributing to the family and community finances.  This chapter alone will change your perception of the Hasidic world.<br /> All in all, this is a fascinating and very readable book.  My only complaint is that, as with so many Jason Aronson books lately, the price is way too high for the average reader. I would like to see a paperback edition make this book more accessible to lower-income scholars.  But, if Hasidism is your field of interest, then this is a valuable addition to your library or personal collection.rback edition make this book more accessible to lower-income scholars.

Happily, the book turned out to be better than its cover, and is one I recommend.<br /><br />  The author, Samuel Heilman, while not himself \\"ultra-orthodox,\\"  is a religiously observant Jew trained in anthropology, making him an insider-outsider who is well-qualified to journey into the Jewish sector of Old Jerusalem.  His methodology is that of a \\"participant observer,\\" learning about the culture by doing it with the people. (Only a religious Jew could undertake such a project among the very orthodox.  A non-Jewish anthropologist would probably not be admitted to many of the gatherings and ceremonies, and, even if he were admitted, could not fully participate.)<br /><br /> The book is well-balanced, presenting both the positive and negative aspects of the culture in a very readable format.  Heilman combines personal experiences among the Haredim with well-written background information about the movement, making the book accessible to readers who might not be familiar with Jewish practices.  I especially liked his descriptions of the different types of Hasidic gatherings, and his explanations of the spirit behind them.  Unlike so many academics who write about Hasidism, he was able to see beyond the superficial plainness of the schools and synagogue buildings (often rather dilapidated) to the beautifully disciplined spirituality of the worshippers.  At the same time, Heilman doesn't idealize the Haredi world.  He covers the rebels and dissidents as well as the true believers.<br /><br /> Readers should keep in mind that these groups are the extremes of the extreme within Orthodox Judaism.  As Heilman explains in the Prologue, he rejected the American Hasidic communities for his study, because they were not the \\"genuine article\\" (his words).  He chose the Jerusalem community because he felt it had made the least acommodations to the modern world. Heilman was specifically looking for extremes, and studied them in the same manner that one might study a \\"lost tribe\\" in the Amazon. So, the Jerusalem Haredim are really a subculture within a subculture within a minority.  One must be careful not to project the contents of this book onto all Jews --- even Orthodox ones.  Taken within those narrowly-specified parameters, \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" is an excellent read.acommodations to the modern world.

US	52499409	R18DGW6O066NIM	0151006520	666826976	Postville: A Clash of Cultures in Heartland America	Books	3	97	135	N	N	A poorly-balanced presentation	I had very mixed feelings about this book.  On the one hand, it's  an interesting tale about what happens when two equally insular -- but very, very different -- cultures clash with each other. On the other hand, it would have been better if Professor Bloom had not allowed his own secular hostility toward the Hasidim to obscure his objectivity.<br /><br /> Bloom came to this project ill-prepared on the Jewish end, in that he knew nothing about Hasidism before he went to Postville.  Like many secular Jews, he had an overly-idealized expectation of all Hasidim as perfect saints and sages.  The disillusionment set in with his very first contact, the bombastic personality of Sholom Rubashkin (manager of the kosher slaughterhouse). Bloom takes an immediate dislike to Rubashkin because, as he later admits, \\"Bits of Sholom reminded me of my own father\\" (p. 159).  This personality conflict then colors Bloom's entire view of Hasidic culture for the rest of the book.  A journalism professor he may be, but an objective sociologist he is not!<br /><br /> Bloom paints the entire Hasidic community as a bunch of loud, boorish, backward bigots.  While it is true that there are prejudices among some of the Hasidim he interviews, there are equally bigoted attitudes among the gentiles.  But Bloom doesn't handle this with much balance.  He is able to see both good and bad in the Postville farmers, but, when it comes to the Hasidim, he reports mostly negative incidents, and repeatedly uses  buzzwords like \\"atrocious,\\" \\"primitive,\\" and \\"stifling\\" to put down the entire Hasidic culture as bad.  With the bigotry of the Iowans, however, he doesn't make such blanket value judgements.  In fact, he seems to want to like them IN SPITE OF the sometimes blatant prejudices that many of them have against Jews.  When asked by Postville farmers if he is Jewish, Bloom reluctantly says yes, but is very quick to distance himself from the Hasidim, lest they think he is one of \\"them.\\"  Is it any wonder that the Hasidim, in turn, grow to distrust him?<br /><br /> Bloom's research was lopsided in other ways, too.  While he seems to have interviewed just about every gentile in town, he only visited a small number of Hasidic families, then extrapolated from that limited experience onto the entire community.  In those few Hasidic homes he did visit (and then only briefly), he went in with a defensive attitude about his own secularism that got in the way of ever understanding the culture from its own POV.  As a result, some of his statements are just plain wrong.  A \\"Shabbos goy\\" is not a non-observant Jew, the chant \\"aye-aye-aye!\\" in Hasidic songs is not a mystical name of God, nor is it bad luck to name a child after a deceased relative (It's CUSTOMARY to name children after deceased relatives.  But it IS bad luck to name a child after a LIVING relative.)  These and other glaring bloopers only serve to underscore that fact that Professor Bloom often does not know what he is talking about, and only succeeds in perpetuating further misunderstandings.<br /><br /> In the end, he comes down on the side of the locals in a political dispute, because, in his words, \\"It was finally time for the pleasant, accepting Iowans to stand up to the Hasidim\\" (p. 320).  But many of the Iowans described in this book were not very pleasant or accepting at all.  The old-timer Postville society was just as closed to outsiders as the Hasidim were, only in different ways.  Just because the locals are more soft-spoken and polite to your face doesn't mean they are any less prejudiced behind your back.  (Interestingly, Bloom likes Sholom Rubashkin's father Aaron, who talks more softly than his son.  Low voice volume seems to be a big priority with the professor.)<br /><br /> Bloom severely criticizes the Hasidim for not mixing socially with the Iowans.  But he seems to miss the double standards of the Iowans themselves, who complain that the Jews don't shop locally, while, at the same time, shunning and harrassing the locals who sell to Jews by shouting \\"Jew lover\\" at them on the streets.  That's \\"atrocious\\" behavior, too, if you ask me.<br /><br /> My conclusion: If you want a book which explores the nature of prejudice (including that of its author) and how it can divide a town against itself, then this is an interesting read.  Just don't rely on it for the details and meanings of Hasidic customs or beliefs, because in that area, it misses the mark.

But the limited space of a review doesn't lend itself to exploring the &quot;kabbalah of music&quot; in depth.  Now there is a book which does exactly that.  Even if you have a tin ear, &quot;Inner Rhythms&quot; will help expand your understanding of how music is used by Hasidim and others to reach the highest spiritual levels that cannot be accessed in any other way. As Rabbi Bachya ibn Pakuda said in the eleventh century, &quot;Speech is the pen of the heart, song is the pen of the soul.&quot;<br /> This book will no doubt have a much wider appeal than Rabbi Pinson's first book, &quot;Reincarnation in Judaism.&quot;  For one thing, it's better writing.  &quot;Reincarnation&quot; established Rabbi Pinson as a meticulous scholar, but it dealt mostly with esoteric theory and was a rather academic read.  Not so with this, his second book. &quot;Inner Rhythms&quot; speaks directly to the heart.<br /> Make no mistake: the careful Torah scholarship is still there, with copious footnotes explaining the sources.  But, in addition, it's clear that Rabbi Pinson has experienced these musical soul phenomena.  Himself a practicing Hasid, he has personally stood among throngs of Hasidim singing the very songs and prayers about which he writes.  When he illustrates his points with stories taken from the entire spectrum of Jewish thought, you know that he understands the spirit as well as the words of these tales.  (The stories alone make the book worth buying!)<br /> The result is a book that not only gives us the kabbalistic theory of music, but also illuminates how music can be used to bring greater spirituuality into our daily lives.  For Jews and gentiles alike, this is a book that will forever change the way you hear music.  Highly recommended!	2000-11-07

I went to five different grade schools, so I could relate.<br /> Yes, the story is slow-paced, and there are some loose ends that never get tied up, but that's the way real life is when your Dad gets transferred and you have to leave everything familiar behind.  Life doesn't always move at the speed of a video game.  The value of the book is that it acknowledges the sad feelings that kids have about moving.  It squarely faces up to the impact of seeing your room disassembled into boxes, the friends who wave goodbye forever, a last visit to the family cemetery, the favorite tree you leave behind...<br /> Ah yes, the tree.  It's a big dogwood in Jason's front yard, where he likes to climb and listen to secrets whispered to him among the leaves.  The tree is firmly rooted in the ground -- it's the tree of HERE, where Jason wishes he could stay forever. The gardener, Mr. Healy (nice reference to &quot;heal&quot;) has taught him all about plants and how to care for them, and the tree is worried that Jason is leaving.  Who will take care of it now?  Jason reassures the tree that the new people will keep Mr. Healy on as their gardener.  Then, just before Jason's family pulls away in the car, Mr. Healy gives him a wonderful gift -- a young dogwood tree to plant in the yard of his new home.  Which he does.  Both Jason and his little tree will put down new roots.  (This I can REALLY relate to -- I planted trees in every place we ever lived.  Sometimes I wonder if those trees are still there...)<br />  All in all, I like this book a lot -- too bad it went out of print.  The illustrations have a surrealistic quality in places, moving back and forth between what is going on around Jason, and the thoughts and feelings inside his Jason's head.  There's one blooper, though.  The story says that &quot;a nest of robins&quot; had lived in a hole in the big dogwood tree.  Sorry, Mr. Potok, but robins don't nest in holes!

But the title of this book, based on the absurd practice that some lesbians have developed of placing a slice of leavened bread (totally forbidden on Passover!) on the seder plate, crosses the line for me.  This is exactly the type of flaunting of tradition that turns me off about the lesbian feminist movement.  I support gay rights as human rights and have done so for over 30 years.  I am aware that the Nazis forced gays to wear pink triangles and gassed them along with the Jews  and was teaching this fact long before the pink triangle was even adopted by the movement.  I tell you this, dear reader, so you will know I'm not a gay-basher.<br /> But I am also deeply offended when ANY group attacks Jewish traditions in such a self-hating manner.  Ceremonies have real  power, and when you turn them upside down, it disturbs the spiritual energy.  You cannot commit a sin to perform a mitzvah -- even a mitzvah of protest.  To purposely own leaven during Passover (one of THE most serious of sins) and then put it on the seder plate turns the entire ceremony into a total travesty.<br /> A lot of Jews will pass up this book on the title alone - I almost did.  As it turns out, the contents are serious food for thought.  Although I disagreed with a lot of things, I learned a great deal about how lesbian Jews feel, the deep alienation they have experienced in the Jewish community, etc.  For those insights, I am thankful.  But with such a blatant lack of respect for the integrity of Jewish ceremonies, this book is not going to convince (and will more likely turn off) those religious Jews who are not already in the gay rights camp.

I have just finished reading the manuscript for this newly-revised third edition (due out November 21) and it is absolutely superb!  Dr. Schwartz literally &quot;wrote the book&quot; on this topic many years ago, and, with each new edition, it just gets better and better.  His book is of interest to both Jews and non-Jews who want to understand what Judaism has to say about vegetarianism and the treatment of animals, written from the perspective of Jewish law and ethics.<br /> What makes this work different from other vegetarian books is that Dr. Schwartz is himself a religous Jew (Modern Orthodox), who takes both Jewish law and his vegetarianism very seriously.  Recognizing that Jews have, by and large, tended to be meat-eaters in past centuries, Dr. Schwartz does not seek to attack Judaism itself for this.  Rather, he carefully examines what Jewish law has to say about the treatment of animals in the light of modern factory farms, along with the responsibity to feed the hungry and care for the environment, and comes to the conclusion that vegetarianism is the logical choice for a religious Jew today, if he or she wants to avoid causing undue suffering to both animals and fellow human beings.<br /> This book is meticulously researched, providing hundreds footnoted sources, including the famous quote by Rabbi Abraham Issac Kook, concerning his beliefs about Jews being vegetarian in the Messianic Age.  (Previous editions of &quot;Judaism and Vegetarianism&quot; gave this quote but no original source reference, causing some anti-vegetarians to claim that it did not really exist.  Thank you, Dr. Schwartz, for finally setting the record straight!)  Much of the old material has been carefully updated, and new material is added, with an expanded section explaining the important kabbalistic and Hasidic doctrine of &quot;raising up the holy sparks&quot; in food, and how this might be reconciled with vegetarianism.  All in all, this is a book that every vegetarian activist should have!ist should have!	2000-10-12

It's too bad this book went out of print, because it's a delightful collection of Hanukkah stories, crafts, recipes, and folklore from around the world.  If you come across a copy somewhere, by all means, do grab it!<br /> The book is divided into eight sections, one for each of the 8 days of Hanukkah.  Each section has a Hanukkah story told by Cherie Schwartz, plus a recipe, craft project, poems, folklore, and customs from around the world.  Not just limited to European Jews, either. You and your children can learn about how Hanukkah is celebrated in Israel, Syria, Spain, North Africa, India, the Sephardic communities, etc.  (Did you know, for example, that Jews in Venice, Italy, used to go house to house singing Hanukkah songs from their gondolas?  They recognized the Jewish homes from the menorahs burning in the windows.)<br /> Along with the usual potato latkes, the recipes include a cake and a fruit salad shaped like a menorah, a tiropia cheese pie from Greece, Hanukkah cookies, and Sweet Israel Chicken.  For crafts, you can make a family scrapbook, Hanukkah mobile, suncatcher, mezuzzah cover, Hamsa (lucky hand) candle, and more.  The book itself is in oversized format, with beautiful illustrations by Wendy Edelson and color photos by Jonathan Gross.  These are fun family projects that will keep your kids interested for the whole week of Hanukkah.  Like I said, it's a good find -- hopefully it will someday come back into print.	2000-10-12

Rabbi Yaakov Yosef of Polnoy, the subject of this 1973 study by Samuel Dresner, was the closest disciple of the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism.  In this book, Dresner presents an academic (but very readable) exploration of Reb Yaakov's model for the Zaddik, or Hasidic Rebbe  -- the saintly leader who is capable of achieving the highest degree of connection (devekus) with God, while, at the same time, also being the center of a community.  This book would be of interest to anyone -- Jewish or not -- who wants to understand what a saintly Jewish life is like.<br /> Reb Yaakov, the subject of this study, didn't start out as a Hasid.  In fact, he was quite opposed to the movement.  His &quot;conversion&quot; took place when the Baal Shem Tov came to town one day and started telling stories in the marketplace, which, in turn, delayed the people from coming to prayers on time.  Reb Yakkov, who was the town rabbi, became furious, and ordered the storyteller brought to him.  When they came face-to-face, the Baal Shem Tov told a story that so deeply moved the rabbi's heart, that he immediately called him &quot;master&quot; and remained his closest disciple for life.<br /> However, Reb Yaakov was not much of a &quot;people person,&quot; being more of a scholarly ascetic, so, after the death of his master, leadership of the Hasidic movement passed to Rabbi Dov Ber of Mezeritch (the Great Maggid) instead.  Reb Yaakov's greatest contribution was to write the first book about Hasidism, called the &quot;Toldot Yaakov,&quot; upon which much of this book is based.<br /> Dresner does an excellent job of presenting Yaakov Yosef's teachings, along with a great deal of historical background about the Jewish world of his time.  What emerges is a very clear picture of the deep spirituality of the Baal Shem Tov and hiis early disciples, with a model of what a Hasidic Rebbe should be like. This book is an excellent read --- my only complaint is the price which, like so many reprints by Jason Aronson lately, is simply astronomical for a paperback edition.

(For non-Jews reading this, the Lubovitcher Hasidim are very Orthodox Jews.) Now I can simply refer them to Rabbi Pinson's book instead!  &quot;Reincarnation in Judaism&quot; is an excellent presentation of Jewish teachings about rebirth, as filtered through the 200-year-old Hasidic line of the seven saintly Lubovitcher Rebbes. (The author himself is a Chabad-Lubovitch rabbi.)<br /> He begins with some Jewish sources on reincarnation which pre-date the Lubovitcher movement, taken from earlier kabbalistic works.  He also points out that some of the classical Jewish sages, such as Saadia Gaon and Maimonides, rejected the idea of reincarnation, mostly because (A) it could not be proven based on intellectual logic, and (B) they probably did not have access to the kabbalah. Belief in it, for Hasidim, is a matter of faith, Rabbi Pinson explains.  Although there are veiled hints in the Bible, one must rely on the kabbalah for further explanations, which have been received from the unbroken line of teachers reaching back to Moses at Mt. Sinai.<br /> The heart of Rabbi Pinson's book is his explanation of how the  613 Torah mitzvot (commandments) correspond to different &quot;compartments&quot; (his word) of a person's &quot;Godly soul&quot;, each of which must be developed through the incarnation of a new personality here on earth.  Each incarnation, in turn, focuses primarily on one of these mitzvot, so that it can take many, many lifetimes -- 613 or more -- to perfect the &quot;Godly soul.&quot;<br /> There are parts of this book that I disagree with, such as his  rather skeptical analysis of modern pastlife therapy cases.  Rabbi Pinson takes the stance that only very highly-developed holy persons (such as the Hasidic masters) actually remember their previous incarnations.  The other cases, he asserts, are more likely to be caused by dybbuks or ibburim (types of possession) or are psychological in origin.  This would be consistent with Lubovitcher thought, which puts a Hasidic Rebbe on a higher plane than ordinary human beings.  However, my own Rebbe, the Breslover, maintains that there is not such a big gap between the souls of Rebbes and ordinary people, and that &quot;everyone can achieve the highest level.&quot;  This debate goes back to the earliest days of the Lubovitch and Breslov movements, and continues today.  (Ironically, the cover art of Pinson's book features a Breslover quote!  Guess the marketing department didn't know the difference.)<br /> One weakness of the book is that it doesn't have a glossary, and often assumes that the reader knows Jewish terms like &quot;mitzvah&quot; and &quot;sefirot.&quot; It also would have helped to have one or more diagrams of the Kabbalistic Tree, for better visualization of various concepts in the text.  Ditto for a chart defining the different &quot;souls&quot; and what they are called in Hebrew.  Readers who are not familiar with the Tanya (on which much of Pinson's soul theory is based) may have some difficulty following certain chapters.  Nevertheless, it is a valuable work and well worth studying.e asserts, are more likely to be caused by dybbuks or ibburim (types of possession) or are psychological in origin.

Boy, was I wrong!  If this theory is true (and it  sure convinced me!), then i'st a strong affirmation of my faith as an  Orthodox Jew.<br /><br /> I confess that the mathematics used here are gibberish  to me, being as math-challenged as I am, but the experiment did pass  peer  review and was published in the Journal of Mathematical Statistics, which  is nothing to sneeze at.  (The original article is in the book, for those  who want to check the math.)<br /><br /> In the area of the Hebrew text, I can  express a more educated opinion.  The idea that the Torah can be read as  one long Name of God (i.e., a continuous series of letters without any word  breaks) is well-known in Jewish mystical circles. In the past, there were a  number of Torah scholars who found skip-sequences coded in the Torah text.  They were able to do this because they had memorized the entire Torah from  beginning to end.  Their brains served as a computer, scanning the letters  -- and occasionally a meaningful skip sequence popped up.  But it was not  until the invention of the modern computer that this type of search could  be done with any kind of scientific consistency.  The result is this book,  which presents a convincing argument for a code in the Bible --- if you  know Hebrew.<br /><br /> One of the weaknesses in Drosnin's presentation is, that  he never tranliterates any of the Hebrew phrases in the printouts.  He  translates the meanings into English, but, without knowing Hebrew, it's  hard to see how the words are encoded in the original language.  Being able  to read the charts is a big part of understanding how the Code works.<br /><br />  For example, on page 15, the letters  \\"yod-tzaddi-chet-kof-resh-bet-yod-nun\\" do indeed spell out  \\"Yitzchak Rabin\\" -- but unless you know Hebrew, yoou just have to  take the author's word for it.  It would have helped Drosnin had also  transliterated into English letters, like this:  \\"y-tz-ch-k-r-b-i-n\\" (in Hebrew, most vowels are not written.)  Even if space did not permit doing this with all the charts, he could have  done it with a few examples of the more easily-recognized names.  At the  very least, he should have provided a chart of the Hebrew alphabet!<br /><br />  So, if you don't read Hebrew, you will just have to take my word for it  that the charts do work.  Take the author's skepticism about God and his  theories of ancient UFO visits with a grain of salt, though.  I agree with  mathematician Eliahu Rips, who first discovered the code: it was written by  God.ve helped Drosnin had also  transliterated into English letters, like this:  \\"y-tz-ch-k-r-b-i-n\\" (in Hebrew, most vowels are not written.)

Although  some Breslover Chassidim did not like this academic approach to the life of  their master, I found it to be quite good.  Sometimes an  &quot;outsider&quot; can see perspectives that the disciples have missed,  and this is the case with &quot;Tormented Master.&quot;  It has interesting  insights into the life and struggles of Rebbe Nachman, which, in turn, had  a big influence on my own decision to become a Breslover. This book is also  more accessible to the average non-Hasidic reader than some of the  &quot;official&quot; Breslov materials, and can serve as an introduction to  Hasidism in general.  Rabbi Green (whom I have met in person), has a deep  love of the Rebbe's teachings, which shines through in the pages of this  book.	2000-09-12

The approach is modernist-feminist but  with a deep, sincere respect for the tradition and  what it can teach us  today.<br /> Both Jews and non-Jews will find insights here about two of the  more troubling stories in the Bible --the casting out of Hagar, and the  almost-sacrifice of Isaac -- both of which are read in the synagogue during  the High Holy Days.  The Torah tells us only  the bare outlines of the  story, but does not explore the feelings of the women involved with much  depth.  But the Bible is not the only sacred text available.  Traditionally, Jews have &quot;filled in the blanks&quot; with a process  called &quot;midrash&quot; (which means &quot;from searching&quot; in  Hebrew) and there is a whole body of this type of literature, which forms  an interpretive lens throough which Jews &quot;see&quot; these stories.  This book uses both classical midrash and personal insiights to explore  some serious questions: Was Sarah justified in demanding that Abraham send  Hagar away?  How could Abraham have even condidered sacrificing his son?  How did this event affect his wife Sarah?  Etc. Etc.  You may not agree  with the opinions offered in this book, but I guarantee it will make you  think!	2000-09-08

First published in 1979, it remains a very good bridge between  kabbalah and modern psychology.  Halevi uses the Tree diagram as a template  for exploring various aspects of the human body, psyche, and soul.  Especially useful are the many Tree diagrams which illustrate how the human  personality fits into kabbalistic thought.  However, the book assumes you  know the names of the Sefirot  (pronounced sfee-ROTE, by the way) and can  picture how they are arranged on the Tree.  Beginners could get a bit  overwhelmed with all the Hebrew terminology, and might want to start with  Halevi's more introductory &quot;The Way of Kabbalah&quot; instead.  Still,  this book does contain a glossary, and if you go slowly and take the time  to learn the definitions and compare the text to the diagrams, you will  find that it all fits together quite nicely.	2000-08-31

This book has nothing to do with either Judaism or Moses.  It has long been regarded as a medieval forgery.  Jews were often burned at the stake  by the Inquisition for supposedly practicing sorcery, and books like this  were used as the \\"proof\\" that such sorcery existed.  In other  words, it's the Jewish equivalent of the bogus \\"Malefactorum\\"  used against pagan witches.  It probably has some value in terms of the  history of witchcraft and other gentile magicks in Europe, but if you are  looking for authentic Jewish mysticism, this ain't it.  The spells are  absolute gibberish if you know even rudimentary Hebrew, and they contain so  many Catholic elements that I burst out laughing.

This is a reprint of a book that was a bestseller in Jewish mysticism circles back in the mid-70's. It played a  big role in my own spiritual  developement, and remains one of the best intro kabbalah books for the  analytical-minded seeker.  If you only buy one of Zev Halevi's books, make  it this one.<br /> He begins with an overview of kabbalah as a living  tradition, using the Tree of Life diagram as a template for diagramming all  aspects of life and spiritual growth.  He then discusses the inner meanings  of various biblical stories and Jewish themes, such as the physical and  spiritual Adam, the Exodus from Egypt, Jacob and Esau, the Promised Land,  the Zaddik (holy person), allegorical and metaphysical levels of meaning,  kavannah (focused intention), higher and lower states of consciousness,  etc. ---  and how all these apply to the inner life as diagrammed on the  Tree.<br /> The heart of the book, in my opinion, are the chapters on the  three main approaches to the spiritual path: Action, Devotion, and  Contemplation.  Most beginners lean heavily toward one of the three, and it  is important to determine which approach is best for you.  (Halevi himself  appears to be a Path of Contemplation person, judging from his intellectual  style.)  Eventually you must balance all three of these aspects -- Doing,  Feeling, and Thinking -- within yourself, but it's important to start with  a compatible teacher and/or group that relates to kabbalah from your basic  approach.  Halevi is rather vague about exactly how you will actually find  practicing kabbalists, appparently relying on the adage that &quot;When the  student is ready, the teacher appears.&quot;  This book will definitely  help you prepare yourself for that encounter.	2000-08-31

This book was first published by Schocken in 1968, and remains one of the best resources in English for understanding what Jewish Law has to say about birth control and abortion. It's not just a simplistic summary or a laundry list, either!  The author explains, in step-by-step detail, the various laws and how they were derived from specific religious texts.  Unfortunately, the current hardcover reprint is a bit pricey, to say the least.  I'd really like to see a paperback reprint to make it more accessible to more people.  Still, if this is your area of interest and you can't find a used copy, then a new one is well worth the price.<br /><br />Chapter One gives an excellent overview of the structure of Jewish Law, explaining the various types of canonical documents -- Talmud, Rashi & Tosafot, Shulchan Arukh, responsa of later authorities, etc. -- which is a great help to readers who are not familiar with these important post-biblical Jewish sources and/or how Jewish Law works.  The rest of the book explores, in clear detail with sources given, such things as Jewish attitudes toward sex, Talmudic references to birth control and abortion, debates about when the soul joins the body, etc., ending with a summary chapter, \\"The Jewish view on birth control.\\" Where appropriate, the author also compares and contrasts Jewish beliefs with those of various Christian groups.  Considering that abortion is such a hot topic in the USA right now, this book should be in the library of every group or individual who wants to understand the Jewish view(s) on this important subject.	2000-08-27

First published in 1969, it remains an excellent and  very readable introduction to Jewish mysticism as practiced by Jews in  modern times.  I discovered it in the early 1970's and literally wore out  my first copy.  It was one of the pivotal books in my own personal quest,  and remains a favorite today.<br /> The &quot;half mystic&quot; in the title  is Rabbi Herbert Weiner (Reform), who describes his personal interactions  with various Jewish mystics and schools of thought, ranging from the highly  academic university professor, Gershom Scholem, to the Breslover Hasidim in  Israel, to an eccentric old scholar living in obscurity on East Broadway.  There's a fascinating interview with the late Lubovitcher Rebbe (Menachem  M. Schneerson) back in the days when he still met with seekers one-to-one,  a personal invitation to a Belzer Hasidic wedding celebration, and a dip in  the holy mikveh used by 16th-century Rabbi Isaac Luria.  Especially  interesting are Weiner's experiences among various Hasidic groups in  Jerusalem, in a more spiritual time before the &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot;  became so highly politicized.  In short, the book is a sort of travelogue  through two critical decades, bridging the kabbalah from the last  generation to remember the pre-Holocaust world, and into the modern era.  For this reason alone, it's a very valuable testimony.<br /> But  don't get me wrong --- this book is not just history.  Weiner's quest is as  valid today as it was over 30 years ago.  Interwoven with his personal  experiences are clear explanations of the teachings, given in the context  where he first received them.  His quest to unravel the secrets is your  quest also.  Little by little, the book teaches you about kabbalah in a  very practical, down-to-earth way.  Highly recommended!	2000-08-23

The book created quite a stir in the  German-speaking world when it first came out in 1997.

I'm giving it five  stars -- not because I really believe she was Anne Frank (I'm skeptical)  but as a vote of free speech for a very brave author.  The book raises some  real questions about how issues from one life might be carried over into  another, and how they might be resolved.

A wise sage was  able to cure him by first sitting under the table with him, pretending that  he, too, was a fowl.  Slowly, step by step, he convinced the prince that  even if he was a turkey, he could still dress, eat, and sit at the table  like a person.  Because the sage related to the prince by first  &quot;meeting him where he was at,&quot; the sage was able to cure his  delusions.<br /> What Avraham Greenbaum does in this book is, to take each  step in the prince's recovery, and apply it to the steps that we take in  our own spiritual growth.  Very clever!  And a fine introduction to the  practical application of Breslov Hasidic teachings in daily life.  We are,  all of us, lving under various delusions that we are something less than we  really are, and these delusions prevent us from being all we can be.<br /> As  an added note, this story is why my nickname on Amazon is  &quot;rooster613&quot; -- the &quot;613&quot; referring to the 613  commandments.  Yes, Avraham, I know you think the story was about a turkey,  not a rooster -- but first heard it as a rooster, and I'm not about to call  myself &quot;turkey613&quot; -- so we will have to agree to disagree on the  exact barnyard bird referred to in the story.

Gentile expressions such as &quot;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath&quot; have  tended to give the impression that the Jewish Sabbath is something  oppressive.  Not so, says Rabbi Heschel.  The Sabbath, when understood  properly, is a gift of freedom.<br /> In this now-classic book, first  published in 1951, Heschel shows how the Sabbath is a &quot;palace in  time,&quot;  a carefully structured retreat from the hustle and bustle of  the marketplace.  The laws of the Sabbath are the spiritual architecture  with which the &quot;palace in time&quot; is built.  Once you understand  the blueprint for that palace, then all of the restrictions and to-do  things on the Sabbath make sense.<br /> Heschel was the first Jewish  theologian (as far as I know) to explain how traditional Jews live more in  sacred time than in  sacred space.  While other religions have devoted  their energy to building physical temples and cathedrals in sacred places,  Jews have erected sanctuaries in the form of sacred days.  Time, like  physical space, has a varied texture to it.  Just as there are differences  between mountains and oceans, so, too, are there are there differences  between the Sabbath and the ordinary days of the week.  The Sabbath is more  than just a secular &quot;day off.&quot; It's a specific creation made by  God in the very dawn of Creation.  The Sabbath is as real as the physical  things we see and touch everyday in the natural world.  But in order to  experience the specialness of the Sabbath, one must step inside the  structure of its special rules and observances -- to enter the &quot;palace  in time.&quot;<br /> This book is beautifully-written in poetic prose that  will inspire both Jews and non-Jews. It goes in and out of print with  various publsihers, so, if it is not available on Amazon right now, track  down a used copy or borrow it from the library.

US	52499409	R2HUAGZUD9NJ1E	0061314218	893082414	001: The Prophets	Books	5	117	125	N	N	A fine Jewish perspective on the biblical prophets	This two-volume work is one of the best I know of for explaining how Jews relate to the Prophets.  While non-Jews tend to think of &quot;prophets&quot; as psychics who foretell the future, the Jewish  concept of a prophet is someone who is inspired by God to advance the cause  of social justice by confronting the people and their rulers. &quot;Feed  the widow, the orphan, the stranger!&quot; shouts the prophet in the  marketplace.  &quot;Forsake your dead idols -- return to the Lord!&quot; he  tells the king.  Yes, the prophet may foretell future events, but he also  preaches another option:  return to the ways of God, and the terrible  things foretold in a prophecy may not have to happen.  A prophecy is a  warning, a call to repentence -- not a prognistication written in stone.<br />  Heschel's scholarship in this work is excellent and very, very  readable, even if you are not a seminarian.  Like his shorter books, such  as &quot;The Sabbath&quot; and &quot;The Earth is the Lord's,&quot;  this  work is written in dynamic, inspiring prose that reaches the level of fine  literature.  In the first volume, he discusses specific biblical prophets  such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.  (Christians may be surprised to learn  that, in classical Jewish sources, the &quot;suffering servant&quot; refers  Jacob who, in turn, is used by Isaiah as a metaphor for the entire Jewish  people collectively.  In other words, the Jews are the &quot;suffering  servant&quot; of God, not Jesus.)  Volume II discusses more general  concepts about prophets and prophecy.<br /> As an historical  note, I would  add that Rabbi Heschel not only wrote about prophets and social  responsibility, he also walked the walk -- quite literally.  He was active  in the Civil Rights movement in the USA, and walked with Dr. Martin Luther  King in the second Selma march in Alabama (look for a white-haired man in a  black skullcap near King, next time you view footage of that event.)  Rabbi  Heschel said of that march that he &quot;felt as if his feet were  praying.&quot;  His book, &quot;The Prophets,&quot; will let you enter the  mind and soul that went with those feet.f that march that he &quot;felt as if his feet were  praying.&quot;  His book, &quot;The Prophets,&quot; will let you enter the  mind and soul that went with those feet.	2000-07-23

I decided to read this book mostly because of the title -- as a  Trekker who is also Jewish, I was interested to see what these  authors had to say about &quot;sacred time,&quot; because, as Abraham Joshua Heschel said, we  Jews live more in sacred time than in sacred places.  So, any book with  &quot;sacred time&quot; in the title is bound to catch my eye.<br /> As it  turned out, their definition of &quot;sacred time&quot; wasn't quite the  same as the Jewish one, but I still enjoyed the book.  It's an excellent  analysis of Star Trek from an anthropology POV.  Especially useful to me  was the clear, concise explanation of what &quot;traditional,&quot;  &quot;modernist,&quot; and &quot;post-modernist&quot; worldviews mean in  terms of how various cultures view time and  the future.  I had heard TOS  called &quot;modernist&quot; and DS9 called &quot;post-modernist&quot;  before, but could never really get a grasp on what that meant, exactly.  (What can I say?  I'm in the over-50 generation and haven't always kept up  on the latest buzzwords.)  This book clearly explained all three POVs --  traditional, modern, and post-modern -- then put them into the context of  various Trek episodes.  Great job!<br /> I also enjoyed the brilliant insight  that Trek has, in effect,  moved primal mythology from sharing a common  story about the past, to sharing a common story about the future.  In  centuries  gone by, each culture assumed its origins story to be the  &quot;real&quot; story, and that was a uniting factor for each group.  But  today, with so many cultures colliding in an ever-shrinking world, we  cannot assume that we all we share the same past heroes anymore.  Instead,  we look to the same future heroes on Star Trek for role models and  inspiration.  Whether or not Trek is the &quot;real&quot; future is beside  the point here.  It has become a mythology that people use on a global  level (to greater or lesser degrees), regardless of the different creation  stories that make up their individual cultures' past mythologies.<br /> I  liked the fact that this book intelligently questioned some of the  politically-correct criticisms of Trek that have come out in recent years.  While not accepting everything on Trek at face value, this book does point  out that some PC critics have bordered on the ridiculous.  The authors here  strike a very good balance between entering into the spirit of the Trek  universe, and critically examining some of the basic assumptions that Trek  makes about what the future &quot;should be.&quot;  &gt;I highly recommend  &quot;Deep Space and Sacred Time&quot; to anyone seriously interested in  the impact of Star Trek on our modern (or is that post-modern? ) culture.s that make up their individual cultures' past mythologies.   <br /> I  liked the fact that this book intelligently questioned some of the  politically-correct criticisms of Trek that have come out in recent years.

This is a Minnesota Historical Society reprint of the anthropological study done by Gilbert Wilson in 1917, originally published as &quot;Agriculture of the Hidatsa Indians: An Indian Interpretation.&quot;  Wilson was among the first of a new school of American anthropologists that  felt Indian cultures should speak for themselves, and not be spoken for by  &quot;white man's&quot; interpretations.  Consequently, the book really is,  as the subtitle says, &quot;an Indian interpretation.&quot;  Most of the  text is translated directly from Buffalo Bird Woman's own words, complete  with stories, jokes, and personal anecdotes about village life.  By the  time you are done reading it, you will feel as if you met her personally.<br /> I bought it because I am a Minnesota gardener, so I wanted to see what  tips I might pick up from the ways of the indigenous people.  The book is  rich with useful gardening lore, including diagrams of various tools and  structures, along with detailed descriptions of the different kinds of  beans, corn, and squash that the Indians grew.  Plus, there are native  recipes you can try.<br /> I was surprised to learn that, when the Indians  dried squash, they didn't use mature fruits with hard skins like we do  today, but preferred to cut them when they were 4 days old -- at about 3  1/2 inches diameter.  They were more tender that way, easier to slice, and  they dried better.  The best squashes were marked in the field and allowed  to mature for seed.<br /> I also found it interesting that the Indians kept  the different colors of corn separate, not like the multi-colored  &quot;Indian corn&quot; we buy today for fall decorations.  Although  Buffalo Bird Woman did not understand the science behind genetics, she and  her fellow Hidatsa gardeners did notice that corn varieties will  &quot;travel&quot; (her word) from one patch to another if different colors  are planted too closely together.  So, women with adjoining fields would  agree to plant the same varieties side-by-side, to help prevent this  &quot;traveling.&quot;<br /> The Hidatsa women also understood the  principles of good seed-saving techniques, and carefully chose seed from  the very best squashes and corn ears in the crop, thereby improving their  strains from year to year.  Composting, however, was apparently unknown.  Leaves and brush were burned, not composted, and they regarded manure as a  dirty substance to be removed from the garden.  But the Hidatsa did know  the value of fallowing, and would allow a less-productive field rest a  minimum of two years to renew itself.<br /> Some of the techniques in this  book are still quite useful today.  I have begun pre-spouting my squash  seeds, and planting them in the SIDES of the hills instead of on top, to  help prevent the heavy rains from damaging the seedlings.  Some of the  fencing designs have found their way into my  rustic Minnesota garden, too.<br /> This book is also a priceless resource for &quot;living history&quot;  re-enactors or &quot;back to the land&quot; homesteaders who might want to  know how to build a  traditional corn-drying platform, a food-storage  cache, a homemade rake, or any of the other tools used successfully for  many centuries before the Europeans came here.

I received this book as a Wish List gift (thank you, dear reader!) and it arrived the day before a local PBS camera crew came to our hobby farm to film a segment on me as a Hasidic gardener.  The idea of a religious Jew  actually working the land (in Minnesota yet!) was so unusual to a certain  writer in Duluth (himself Jewish), that he felt it merited a TV story!<br />  I suspect that &quot;Ecology and the Jewish Spirit&quot;  will sell very  well for the same reason: most people -- Jewish or not -- simply do not  associate the Jewish religion with ecology.  The idea seems so novel, they  just have to know more...<br /> As Ellen Bernstein points out in her  introduction to this excellent anthology, the lack of specific  references  to &quot;environment&quot; and &quot;nature&quot; in traditional Jewish  sources does not mean that Jews have no connection to nature.  &quot;Rather,&quot; she writes, &quot;Judaism's ecological message emerges  when we observe what is sacred in Judaism.  How are we to treat what is  holy?  And what is humanity's place amid the holiness?  The Jewish  understanding that the earth belongs to God attests to the fact that the  earth and everything in it is holy, and this concept of holiness, kedushah,  is the beginning of a unique Jewish environmental ethic.&quot; (p. 13)<br />  This book explores that ethic through 37 essays by Jews from all kinds of  backgrounds, organized into three sections: Sacred Place, Sacred Time, and  Sacred Community.  The styles are as varied as their authors, ranging from  personal anecdotes about relating to Judaism and nature, to an excellent  explanation of the ethics behind the agricultural laws in the Torah, to a  liturgy for celebrating the Jewish Festival of the Trees (Tu B'Shevat).  Page 205 has a list of the special brochahs (Hebrew blessings) to be said  upon seeing various works of nature.  Did you know that Judasim has a  separate blessing for seeing a rainbow, the ocean, or trees in bloom?  Sadly, these particular brochahs have fallen out of use among urbanized  Jews. Perhaps this book will help revive awareness of them among modern  Jews.<br /> Of special interest to me was the essay &quot;Practical Kabbalah:  A Family History&quot; by Charles Fenyesi, whose ancestors came from  Eastern Europe, where his family had owned and worked 30 acres of land. (So  much for the old stereotype of Hasidic Jews being urban.)  He tells how his  ancestors &quot;religiously&quot; gathered organic debris of all kinds, to  &quot;toss into the sort of heap that we moderns call a compost pile.&quot;  This would eventually be carted off to their fields and vegetable garden.<br /> &quot;Nothing should go to waste!&quot; was their motto -- not out of  stinginess, but from an understanding that everything has a place and  should be treated with respect, not wasted.  Life was a &quot;productive  loop,&quot; not a vicious cycle.  This ecological awareness, Fenyesi  explains, came from within the Hasidic-kabbalistic worldview of traditional  Judaism.  His family didn't talk about &quot;ecology&quot; in modern words,  but they lived it as an integral part of daily life in the stetl (Jewish  village).  Religion encompassed all things, including what should be thrown  on the compost pile.<br /> Another story I liked, wihch was a bit amusing to  me at first, was Eileen Abrams' account of how she grew a plot of barley in  the tiny yard in front of her Philadelphia rowhouse.  A friend of hers  wanted some barley stalks and heads for a craft project. OK, why not?  Eileen quickly went from land lender to barley steward.  She had never seen  barley grow before (hard for me to imagine, living as I do in the  Midwest!).  She soon became fascinated with the life cycle of this plant  that was used for the Omer sacrifice in the ancient Jerusalem Temple.  My  initial amusement grew into respect as I read how she observed and nurtured  this tiny plot of grain from seed to harvest.  Her reverence for that bit  of barley heightened my own awareness of the local fields of grain that I  take for granted.<br /> All in all, this book was such a great read, I stayed  up half the night with it.

US	52499409	R2OQKOEIAUC4WE	0910818835	243170297	They Called Her Rebbe the Maiden of Ludmir	Books	3	25	28	N	N	Historical fiction - not a biography	Chana Rochel, the &quot;Maiden of Ludmir,&quot; was an  historical personage and yes, she was also a Hasidic Rebbe who counted learned rabbis among her many followers.  Her remarkable story is well-known among  Hasidim, and certainly deserves to be told to the general public.  Unfortunately, Gershon Winkler was not the one to do it.<br /> I was very  disappointed in this book, which is a work of fiction that borders on  fantasy, and comes mostly from Winkler's imagination.  The Chana Rochel I  know from the legends was a deeply spiritual mystic with profound respect  for Jewish tradition.  Yes, she was a woman doing some &quot;male  things&quot; such as wearing a tallis (prayer shawl) and tefillin  (phylacteries), but that was not her central identity.  Serving God was.  There is nothing in her story to indicate that she wanted to overthrow  rabbinic Judaism.<br /> The Chana Rochel we meet in this book is an  iconoclast who spouts arguments that were common in third-wave feminist  circles in the mid-1980's (when, I presume, this book was being written.  It was first published in 1991.)  The seven-page polemical exchange between  her and Rabbi Mordechai of Chernobyl (pp. 40-47) sounds as if it came from  a Jewish Renewal pamphlet.  The result is a preachy novel that reads like  propaganda.  Maybe it is.<br /> Most disappointing was the way in which  Winkler completely altered the pivotal mystical incident in Chana Rochel's  life, when she received her personal mission from God.  In the original  legends, the story reads like this:<br /> &quot;...One morning while visiting  her mother's grave, Chana Rochel fainted and fell into a coma.  Upon  regaining consciousness, she asked for her father, and told him she has  just come from Heaven, where she had been present at a sitting of the  Heavenly Court and had received a new and sublime soul.  Rabbi Moderchai of  Chernobyl substantiated her claims, saying, 'We do not know whose religious  soul is dwelling in this woman.'&quot; (S. Feldbrand, From Sarah to Sarah,  p. 53)<br /> From the description above, it would seem that Chana Rochel had  a near-death experience (NDE) and returned as a &quot;new person&quot; with  the sanction of the Heavenly Court.  She was now a holy woman with a  mission.  The idea of receiving a &quot;new&quot; or &quot;extra&quot; soul  refers to the phenomenon of &quot;sod ha-ibbur,&quot; or the benign  attachment of a holy soul to a living person for a good purpose.  In  &quot;new-age&quot; or shamanic terms, she had a power vision.  From that  point on, she knew herself to be a Rebbe and began to attract followers,  including the Rebbe of Chernobyl.<br /> In Winkler's version, The Rebbe of  Chernobyl questions her at the age of 12, long before the incident in the  cemetery took place.  They  discuss, not spiritual visions, but the role of  women in Jewish law.  Chana comes across merely as a child prodigy who  out-argues the rabbi.  As for the cemetery incident, she simply falls  asleep and dreams about the other world (no coma, no NDE), then awakens in  a panic:<br /> &quot;...The night was pitch black.  She sat up, dazed; for a  moment, she did not know where she was.  Then memory came rushing back: she  was in a cemetery.  At night.  In the dark.  Alone.  The worst nightmare of  a living mortal... As she walked, she grew increasingly frightened...  Each  tombstone seemed alive, swaying menacingly tward her.  This was the world  of the dead; the night was their time.  Every frightening ghost tale she  had ever read spun through her memory, haunting every part of her being.  The wind was howling fiercely.  To the frightened young woman, it sounded  like many voices calling out to her, beckoning her... She no longer  remembered or cared in which direction she ran, whether she was headed  toward the gate or back into the depths of the cemetery. She only knew she  had to run from those voices...&quot;  (Winkler, They called her Rebbe, p.  103)<br /> Thus doesGershon Winkler transform a mystical journey to the  Heavenly Court into a Gothic panic attack in a ghost-filled cemetery.  This  example is pretty much par for the whole book, where her religous devotions  are consistently altered into  modern social issues.  Gone are her daily  walks to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem with her tallis and tefillin, or her  addresses to crowds that gathered outside her home on Shabbos, or the  pilgrimages she led to Rachel's Tomb for prayers. (see Feldbrand, p. 54.)  Instead, she is building a kibbutz and lecturing women on self-esteem.<br /> And what, exactly, are we to make of a character named &quot;Zeide  Zalman,&quot; who is obviously based on Rabbi Zalman Schachter of the 20th  century, also known as Zeide Zalman, whom Winkler admires in real life?  In  the story, Zeide Zalman is a mysterious smiling old sage, origins unknown.  Chana Rochel seeks to find out his identity through meditation, but  &quot;all she came away with was the idea that he was a momentary loan from  another time, a future time.&quot; (p. 190) So what are we to gather from  this  episode -- that Zalman Schachter went back in time to give Chana  Rochel her peace of mind?  Apparently.  And as if to be sure we get the  point, the Zeide Zalman in the story even gives her a  &quot;mysterious&quot; Hanukkah menorah -- an obvious literary reference to  a short story about Chana Rochel by Zalman Schachter in his book, &quot;The  Dream Assembly.&quot;  Nice fantasy, but...<br /> Like I said, the real  story of Chana Rochel of Ludmir has yet to be written (deep sad sigh).  Perhaps one day, it will be done by a Hasidic woman who understands the  inner spirit as well as the outer form of her story.03) <br /> Thus does Gershon Winkler transform a mystical journey to the  Heavenly Court into a Gothic panic attack in a ghost-filled cemetery.

As a religious Jew who is perfectly happy with his own faith, I rarely read Christian theology.  And frankly, I'm turned off by cover art that combines the Cross with the Star of David.  An eclectic I am not!  But,  since the book was sent to me by the publisher in my capacity as a  writer/reviewer on  reincarnation topics, I decided to give it a try.  I'm  very glad I did.<br /> Admittedly, it took a while for me to get used to the  &quot;fundamentalist&quot; style of this author, who is clearly aiming at  the more traditional end of the Christian spectrum.  But if you want a  clear, chapter-and-verse explanation of why reincarnation is compatible  with Chrisitianity, this book is the best I have see so far.<br /> I was  especially impressed with chapter four, &quot;Ye shall be born again,&quot;  which argues that this line was originally a reference to reincarnation,  not to changing one's religion!  Puryear's argument goes something like  this:  In the original Gospel reference (John 3:-13), a Pharisee named  Nicodemus  comes to Jesus and says, in effect, &quot;Rabbi, we know you are  a teacher from God, because nobody can do these miracles unless God is with  him.&quot;  The unspoken question is, how did Jesus get to be such a holy  man in the first place?  Puryear assumes this conversation is not an attack  by a &quot;hypocritical&quot; Pharisee, but a sincere question from one  religious Jew to another.  Jesus then replies to Nicodemus, &quot;Truly,  truly I say to you: Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom  of God.&quot; Nicodemus seems skeptical and wants further clarification.  He asks if it is  necesary to go back into his mother's womb to be born  again, and if so, how is this possible?<br /> Now, here is the crux of the  argument:  Most Gospel readers assume that Nicodemus' question about going  back into the womb is said in a mocking tone, simply because he is a  Pharisee.  But there is nothing in his words to support this.  Personal  skepticism is there, yes -- but he is not mocking.  He addresses Jesus  respectfully as &quot;Rabbi,&quot; and he says he knows he is from God.  Why would he say that, if he were mocking?  What if it was a sincere  question, and Nicodemus was seeking to clarify if &quot;rebirth&quot; was  literally rebirth in the womb, and, if so, how does it happen?  Then the  next statements by Jesus -- about how one must be born of &quot;water and  the spirit,&quot; that &quot;flesh begets flesh and spirit begets  spirit,&quot;  and that the wind (in Hebrew or Greek, the same word means  &quot;spirit&quot;) goes &quot;where it wills,&quot; make sense as  references to reincarnation.  Jesus is not telling Nicodemus to get  baptized, he is saying that a soul must be born over and over again to  become a Zaddik (saint).  Not into his mother's womb again in this life,  but into another womb when the spirit goes &quot;where it wills&quot; in  the next life.<br /> Puryear's explanation of this encounter between Jesus  and Nicodemus opened up a whole new way of seeing this story for me.  What  a fantastic insight!  Unfortunately, in spite of seeing the sincerity in  this particular Pharisee's questions, Puryear sometimes falls into the old  stereotype of Pharisees as nothing but legalistic hypocrites who are too  &quot;blind&quot; to see the truth.  His case would have been greatly  strengthened if he had realized that the &quot;Pharisees&quot; are the  rabbis of the Talmud, who practiced forms of meditation and mysticism as  well as legal debates about the Torah. In this area of Jewish-Christian  relations, Puryear fell  short.  Still, we must keep in mind who his  intended audience is: traditional Christians who take the Bible literally.  His goal is not to do textual criticism of the Gospels, but to present a  Bible-as-truth argument for reincarnation from within a believing POV.  Given those parameters, he does an excellent job with his thesis.  If you  are a Christian interested in reincarnation, this book may well prove that  it is compatible with your own faith.terested in reincarnation, this book may well prove that  it is compatible with your own faith.	2000-07-04

But until they do, we'll have to be content with the 70 Rules we  have, because, as Quark says on page vi, \\"I doubt you humans could  handle much more.\\"<br /><br /> This is a pocket-sized book that simply lists  the Rules for handy reference, along with some B&W stills from the  series.  It doesn't tell you anything about the cultural context, history  or practical application(s) of the Rules -- for that, you should get  [[ASIN:0671007289 Legends of the Ferengi]] also by Ira Steven Behr & friends.<br /><br /> Before I go any further, I should clarify that, contrary to popular  stereotypes, the Ferengi are NOT supposed to be based on Jews.  (They are  based on \\"Yankee Traders\\" -- see TNG episode \\"The Last  Outpost.\\")  As a rabbi who is also a Trekker, I can tell you that some  of these Rules go directly against true Jewish values: \\"When in doubt,  lie\\" (#266) would violate the Ten Commandments, as would \\"Never  ask when you can take\\" (#52).  \\"Females and finances don't  mix\\" (#94) isn't very Jewish either, since the Book of Proverbs  clearly says of the virtuous woman that \\"she considers a field and  buys it; with her profits she plants a vineyard.\\"  In the  \\"ultra-orthodox\\" Hasidic world that some fans [wrongly] believe  these rules are spoofing, the women frequently have their own businesses.  So no, Ferengi culture is not Jewish culture.<br /><br />The only reason people think  the Ferengi are a metaphor for Jews is because the old stereotype says that  Jews love money, and the Ferengi really *do* love money -- but then again,  doesn't everybody love money?  As Rule #284 states, \\"Deep down  everyone is a Ferengi.\\"<br /><br /> And that's the reason this book is so much  fun.  The Ferengi Rules spoof the world of business in a way that lets us  all admit that financial success is OK.  In a society where we are all  supposed to idealistically disdain money as \\"the root of all  evil\\" but where, in real life, we all need money to survive, the  straightforward greed of the Ferengi culture let's us have a good laugh at  ourselves -- and frees us up to pursue our own  success.  I keep a copy of  the Rules on my desk, and have sometimes used them in the Ferengi section  of the Amazon community (otherwise known as \\"Auctions and  ZShops\\") to give good feedback.  What buyer doesn't smile at being  told that \\"Good customers are as rare as latinum -- treasure  them\\" (#57).  Conversely, the Rules provide a humorous way to deal  with all those net spammers who want  my time for free -- because, after  all, \\"Anything worth doing is worth doing for money\\" (#13).  I  could go on and on, but I'll end this review here, even though \\"Enough  is... never enough\\" (#97.)y, and the Ferengi really *do* love money -- but then again,  doesn't everybody love money?

It's an academic study, not a how-to book, but it does contain quite a bit of material translated from firsthand  Hasidic sources, about how the Rebbes and their followers approached their  daily prayers.  As such, it is of great value to anyone interested in the  inner dynamics of prayer. Both Jews and non-Jews will find gems of wisdom  in this book.  I am very glad to see it back in print.<br /> From the  outside looking in, Hasidic prayer appears to be nothing more than endless  repetition, chanted so quickly that the casual observer wonders how the  worshipper can possibly focus on the meaning of the words.  In a world  where &quot;slowly&quot; is often associated with &quot;more sincere,&quot;  the rapid-fire pace of traditional Jewish liturgy is often misunderstood by  outsiders as mere rote.  But the inner dynamics of Hasidic prayer are  something far different and much more sublime.<br /> The key word is  &quot;kavannah,&quot; or focused attention, which transforms the seemingly  &quot;rote&quot; repetitions  into a mystical act of &quot;elevating holy  sparks.&quot;  The words may be the same over and over, but the kavannah  must be freshly-focused each time, because every prayer is a new offering  to God.  Properly done, Hasidic prayer &quot;transcends syllables and  sounds&quot; to become an act of spiritual redemption.<br /> This book was  among the first in English to discuss the role of kavannah for the general  public, and open up the various ways in which a Hasid puts his heart and  soul into the recitation of the daily liturgy.  Many Jews who read this  book back in the 1970's saw, for the first time,  the similarities between  Hasidic prayer and forms of Eastern mantra meditation.<br /> The author  gives an overview of Hasidism and the various prayerbooks used by Hasidism,  then discusses the role of gestures and melodies, various forms of  contemplative prayer, ecstatic prayer, the elevation of &quot;strange&quot;  or distractiing thoughts during prayer, prayers as inspiration, and the  difference between the prayers of the Zaddik (Hasidic saint) and a ordinary  Hasid, inluding the custom (still practiced today) of leaving a written  prayer request (kvittel) on a Hasidic Rebbe's grave.<br /> One technique  that is not discussed here is the hisboddidus prayer of Rabbi Nachman of  Breslov (Bratzlav), where the individual goes into solitude and speaks  spontaneously to God in his or her own words, as a spontaneous &quot;stream  of consciousness&quot; prayer.  Although Jacobs cites Rabbi Nachman several  times on other topics, he does not seem to have picked up on the centrality  of hisboddidus prayer in the practice of Breslov Hasidism.  Either that, or  he made a conscious decision to focus on prayer techniques related to the  written prayerbook only.  Still, given the time period in which this book  was written, it was a fine achievment, and remains valuable today, as a  good intro to the spiritual side of Hasidism.contemplative prayer, ecstatic prayer, the elevation of &quot;strange&quot;  or distractiing thoughts during prayer, prayers as inspiration, and the  difference between the prayers of the Zaddik (Hasidic saint) and a ordinary  Hasid, inluding the custom (still practiced today) of leaving a written  prayer request (kvittel) on a Hasidic Rebbe's grave.   <br /> One technique  that is not discussed here is the hisboddidus prayer of Rabbi Nachman of  Breslov (Bratzlav), where the individual goes into solitude and speaks  spontaneously to God in his or her own words, as a spontaneous &quot;stream  of consciousness&quot; prayer.

When it first came out, it filled a great need for an intelligently-written book where both Jews and non-Jews  could read the traditional sources on what Jews believe about the Messiah.  As it turns out, those sources are much richer and far more complex that  you might imagine.<br /> Patai does not seek to present any particular  doctrine as &quot;the truth,&quot; nor does he seek to convert anybody to  anything.  He simply presents all the materials he could find, with some  academic overviews of the basic themes.  His approach is that of an  academic folklorist, not a theologian -- in fact, the book is subtitled  &quot;Jewish Legends of Three Thousand Years.&quot;<br /> The chapters cover  such things as pre-existent names of the Messiah, prophecies, apocalyptic  writings, birth of the Messiah, stages of the Great Redemption, Last  Judgement, Resurrection, dreams and visions of the future world, etc.  There are sources from the Bible, Talmud, Midrash, medieval texts, Hasidic  teachings, and modern accounts.  Plus there are literary references to the  Messiah from such writers as Elie Wiesel, Scholom Asch, Martin Buber, Jacob  Wasserman, etc. All in all, 337 pages of prime material.<br /> Most  interesting were the various people who have claimed (or were once thought  to be) the Jewish Messiah, ranging from Bar Kochba to Shabbetai Zevi to --  get this -- Theodore Herzl!  Yes indeed, the founder of the Zionist  movement once dreamed that he was the Chosen One (see pp. 272-73) and  apparently saw himself as a savior of the Jewish people -- albeit a secular  one.  (And I suppose if this book were to be updated now, it would also  include the late Lubovitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, as well.  He never made the claim, but some of his followers did.)<br /> One rather  startling piece of info is a chapter on  a mythological character named  &quot;Armilus&quot; who is a villain that will oppose the true Messiah (see  pp. 156-64.)  This brought me up short, because the Edgar Cayce readings  say that the soul of Jesus  is called &quot;Armilius&quot; in the next  world.  Prior to reading Patai's book, that was the only reference to any  &quot;Armilius&quot; I had heard of.  Did Cayce read this legend somewhere?  If so, he got the story all mixed up, because the Armilus described in the  Messiah texts is a pretty nasty guy and not at all like the Jesus of the  Gospels.<br /> When the true Messaih does come, according to the legends in  this book, the righteous will be treated to a heavenly banquet, where they  will eat the Leviathan, a huge fish-creature created especially for this  purpose.  Also served will be it's dry-land counterpart, Behemoth.  (Which  means &quot;beast&quot; in Hebrew.  Anybody care for a nice juicy slice of  Roast Beast?) Those who prefer fowl can enjoy the flesh of the Ziz, a  wading bird of cosmic proportions.  (Vegetarians, I suppose, will dine on  the fruits from the Garden of Eden.)<br /> All in all, this is an excellent  sourcebook for teachings that range from the sublime to the utterly  bizarre.

How much did American Protestants know about the Nazi persecution of Jews during WWII?  Up until this book was published in 1980, the usual answer was &quot;very little.&quot;  Then Dr. Robert Ross, Ph.D., asked his own Protestant denomination what they had done to help the Jews.  He was told,  &quot;We didn't know about it.&quot;  Ross wanted to find out if that was  really true.  From that personal question about the role of his own church,  came this groundbreaking study that broke the silence about a moral failure  of titanic proprotions.  Yes, they certainly did know, but most did nothing  about it.<br /> To conduct his study, Dr. Ross chose 50 national Protestant  publications, ranging from the &quot;Christian Century&quot; (mainstream)  to the &quot;Arkansas Baptist&quot; (fundamentalist).  [A complete list of  the publications used, with their denominational affiliations, is included  in the book.] Then he and his graduate assistants went page-by-page through  all the issues from 1933-1945.  When I heard Dr. Ross speak in 1982, he  told how, in some cases, the pages in the bound volumes were still uncut  and stuck together.  In all those years, NOBODY had gone through those  library copies even once.  Talk about denial!<br /> So, what did Ross's team  find?  Detailed articles, editorials, paid ads, missionary reports, appeals  for money and help, letters to the editors -- all focused on the  persecution of the Jews.  Dr. Ross quotes extensively from all this  material, making this work a valuable source book in Holocaust studies for  both Jews and Christians.<br /> In the fall of 1933, Frederick Lynch, of  &quot;The Reformed Church Messenger,&quot; reviewed Adolf Hitler's book,  &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, and noted that he &quot;gives vent to his hatred of  the Jews in many vitriolic passages&quot; and duly notes his intention to  rid Germany of them.  Unfortunately, Lynch dismissed Hitler's hatred of  Jews as a political ploy against communism, and felt that his antisemitism  was &quot;simply a part of his scheme to make a nation of only one blood,  one race, one religion.&quot;  The genocidal implications of such a  Jew-free state seems to have escaped Mr. Lynch completely.  In Dr. Ross's  opinion, &quot;Lynch had quite clearly succumbed to the Nazi propaganda  that Hitler had saved Germany from communism and to the antisemitic slur  that 'communist' meant 'Jew.'&quot; (Ross, p. 19)  Unfortunately, Lynch's  review set the pattern for how many American Christians would view Hitler's  persecution of the Jews throughout the coming war: as politicially  justified anti-communist tactics. (Even into the in the 1960's in the USA,  &quot;Commie-Jew&quot; was regarded as one word.)<br /> Others Protestant  writers in the 1930s believed the stories of persecution, but saw in them a  fulfillment of Bible prophecies and therefore concluded that it was  &quot;God's Will&quot; for the Jews to suffer.  Ross attributes much of the  Christian complancency to a tendency to see Jews as pawns of prophecy  instead of flesh-and-blood human beings.  In the rural areas especially,  many of the readers had never met a living Jew, and knew of them only  through Bible references.  &quot;The Jews&quot;, to many American  Christians of that era, were a mythological symbol and not real people.  This, according to Ross, led to moral inaction and failure to try to rescue  them from Hitler.<br /> After The USA entered WWII in 1942, censorship on  both sides made it more difficult to get info about what was happening to  the Jews under Hitler.  Nevertheless, reports about the deportations, slave  labor camps, gas chambers and and death marches DID get through and was  published in many of the Protestant publications.  One group that  consistently published paid ads about the atrocities was the International  Hebrew Chrstian Alliance, which did missionary work to convert Jews to  Christanity.  Their U.S. fundraiser ads tried to appeal to universal  Christian brotherhood by saying, in effect, that these converted Jews were  now fellow Christians now and deserved to be helped the same as any other  Christians.  While these ads might strike some readers (including myself)  as rather self-serving, nevertheless, they *did* include detailed  descriptions and photos of the atrocities against Jews.<br /> All in all, Dr.  Ross's study proved beyond a doubt that plenty of information about the  Holocaust was readily available to American Protestants throughout the  entire Hitler era, provided they bothered to read the publications of their  churches.  In the final chapter, &quot;Too long have we Christians been  silent,&quot; Ross addresses the moral failure of his own religion to come  to the aid of Jews under Hitler. He comes to the conclusion that, although  the prtess reported far more about the Holocaust than was previously  believed, the reality of it all had not sunk in.  &quot;In the end,&quot;  writes Ross on the last page, &quot; editors and writers seemed unable to  cope with something as unreal, even unimaginable, as the mass slaughter of  millions of people... They could report this madness, this unreality, but,  beyond the reporting and even beyond the expressed shock and horror over  the discvery of the death camps, there remains the waful pall that hangs  over this entire episode in modern history.&quot;<br /> This book had the  shock effect that its author intended, and became a minor bestseller in  Holocaust studies circles.  It shattered forever the illusion that American  Christians didn't know about the Holocaust, and laid bare the moral  question, still debated to this day: If they did know so much, why did they  do nothing?l  Christian brotherhood by saying, in effect, that these converted Jews were  now fellow Christians now and deserved to be helped the same as any other  Christians.

This little inspirational book is small in size but big in meaning.  Don't let the brevity of some of these quotes fool you -- they could each be a meditation for a whole lifetime.<br /> Although these quotes come from the Hasidic tradition, one does not have to be a Hasidic Jew  in order to use  this book.  Editor Yitzchok Leib has selected passages that are relevant to  anyone seeking a path to God, and especially for Jews in recovery, who  might need a quick quote as a pick-me-up throughout the day.  Non-Jews will  find it interesting, too, as they discover about a type of Jewish  spirituality that is not so well-known to the general public.<br /> The  quotes are arranged by topic into 16 sections, each beginning with a quote  from Rebbe Nachman of Breslov (founder of the Breslover Hasidic movement,  died 1810), followed by excerpts from the letters of his chief disciple and  recorder of his teachings, Reb Nosson of Nemirov.  Among the Breslover  Hasidim, letter-writing has been raised to a spiritual art, and Reb Nosson  was the master of masters in using this literary form.  His letters,  although originally addressed to individual Hasidim, were intended to be  inspiring essays on how everyone can apply the teachings, and were  eventually published for all to read...The compact size of this little volume makes it very convenient to  slip inconspicuously into a purse or briefcase for reading in those  otherwise &quot;wasted&quot; moments on the bus, subway, or waiting in  line.

Walter Koenig is the second cast member from classic Trek to openly discuss his Jewishness (the first being Leonard Nimoy. William Shatner is also Jewish but so far, he has made only very scant mention of it in his  prolific pile of print.)<br /> In this truly candid autobiography, we learn  that Walter Koenig's grandfather's surname was originally Koenigsberg, and  that the family were Russian Jews who from Vilna, Lithuania. (Where they  were hated as both Russians and as Jews by the local Lithuanian populace).  Like so many immigrants who came to the USA in the late 1800's, grandfather  Koenigsberg had his name shorted at the immigration desk.  His son, Isadore  Koenig (Walter's father), worked for RCA in the 1930's and, because he  spoke several languages, was sent to Europe as their representative in the  1930's.  Walter describes a hair-raising childhood scene in a German train  station, where his father lies through his teeth in order to pass for a  visiting German-American in a land where Jews are already being forced to  wear yellow stars.  The ruse works, and the German officer encourages Herr  Koenig to remain in Germany where &quot;great things are happening in the  fatherland.&quot;  No thanks.<br /> Back in the USA, the Koenigs are  suspected of being Communists during the McCarthy era, both because they  are of Russian background, and  because Walter's father is a member of the  Labor Party and reads the Daily Worker.  The fact that the Rosenbergs -- an  American Jewish couple accused of spying for the Communists in the 1950's  -- were actually executed as traitors by the American govenment does not  exactly make Walter feel secure about his identity.  Is it any wonder he  turned out to be, in his own words, such a neurotic?<br /> His acting  career seems to have happened almost by accident, based, in part, on the  encouragement of a kind school teacher who saw potential in an unpopular  child with low self esteem. Walter came up through the ranks like most  actors, and eventually got the part of Chekov because of another Russian  character he had previously played.<br /> At the Trek audition, he played  Chekov as a more serious character, but Roddenberry asked him to do it  again in a comic mode -- which he did, and got the part.  However, Koenig  never felt that Chekov was given much depth beyond cliches about how the  Russians claimed to have invented everything (a joke on real-life  historical revisionism in the USSR), and doesn't feel that the character  really came into his own until the Star Trek IV movie.  Walter also points  out a really major continuity blooper regarding Chekov: that Khan in Star  Trek II recognizes Chekov from the &quot;Space Seed&quot; episode -- but  that aired in the first season, and Chekov did not come onto the Enterprise  until the next season!  Prudently, Walter did not point this out to the  producer, lest his character get written out of the scene.<br /> One mystery  that Koenig didn't clear up in this book is -- exactly where did he get the  accent he used for Chekov?  Over the years, quite a few critics have said  it's not really an authentic Russian accent.  And yet, his family were  Russians -- er, that is, Russian Jews from Lithuania, which is not the same  thing as a Russian from Moscow.  Was his &quot;Russian&quot; accent based  on a local dialect from his family background (where some Yiddish would  have been thrown in also)?  He doesn't say.<br /> The Trek parts of the book  didn't provide much new (to me, at least) info, but did give some  interesting perspectives on anecdotes I had heard before.  One  disappointment was that he didn't go into much detail about his post-Trek  part as the psi-cop, Bester, on Babylon 5.  It would have been nice to hear  more about how he developed this character, and what it was like on the B5  set, etc., especially since Walter felt that the Bester character had more  depth than Chekov.  However, since Warped Factors is basically a Trek  book, maybe he is holding out on the Bester character  for a more in-depth  discussion in a future B5 book? I guess we'll just have to wait and see.  Meanwhile, this book is a good read -- even if it is a bit neurotic.s basically a Trek  book, maybe he is holding out on the Bester character  for a more in-depth  discussion in a future B5 book?

Actually, this book is NOT out of print -- as of this writing, it's listed on Amazon.co.uk as being available from the British publisher.  Hopefully it will again be available in the USA, too, but if not, it's well worth the  extra effort to import a copy if you are dealing with the question of  suicide.<br /> When the author's son, Richard, committed suicide in 1982, she  was totally devastated. His life had been very painful, with both physical  and mental illness, and he had reached a point where he no  longer felt  life was worth living.  Like all mothers who lose a child, Dore Deverell  wished she could have done more for him while he was alive, so that he  would not have given up hope.  It wasn't really her fault that he killed  himself, but she still felt guilty in her grief.<br /> Was it possible that  she could now help his soul after death?<br /> Dore's Roman Catholic  upbringing had taught her that suicide was a mortal sin, and that there is  not much hope for the souls of suicides in the next world, but she refused  to accept that.  She prayed for him daily, and began a personal search for  better answers. She discovered the teachings of Austrian-born philosopher  Rudolf Steiner (Anthroposophy) which suggested that one can help the souls  of the dead to progress in the next world, by reading to them from  inspirational writings.  So she began to read to Richard as if he were  still alive and in the room with her.<br /> The technique worked.  She  claims she could sense him in the room, and that his soul became lighter  and more free of the depression that had caused him to take his life.  Eventually, the soul that was Richard reincarnated as a baby girl named  Maria.  Dore believes her prayers and reading lessons helped him to get  past the karma of the suicide, to continue on his spiritual journey in a  new and, hopefully happier, incaernation.<br /> Whether or not you believe in  reincarnation, this book has many good parts about dealing with the suicide  of a friend or loved one.  This is a mother's story, written from the  depths of her heart, and her love for him really shows.  The tragedy of  Richard's life as she tells it is soul--wrenching, but it's a good  catharsis also.  It's also a testimony to the power of prayer.<br /> I have  one complaint about the book which may sound nitpicky to some, but it  bugged me, so here it is:  On page 117-18, she suggests prayers and  religious material for reading out loud to deceased souls, saying:  &quot;The material must be spiritually inspired, e.g., the New Testament  (especially the Gospel of John), all of Ralph Waldo Emerson's work, the  Bhagavad Gita, biographies of saints.  I chose Rudolf Steiner's work  because he gives the most comprehensive truth about the cosmos and human  being and their connections and purpose.&quot;<br /> OK, so Deverell is an  Anthroposophist, and I can accept that she finds Steiner's work to be  &quot;the most comprehensive&quot; among her suggestions.  And those other  &quot;spiritually inspired&quot; sources are probably good, too. (I'll  assume she skipped the more antisemitic parts of the Gospel of John).

Hasn't she ever been inspired by the opening chapters of Genesis?  The Psalms?

So, four  stars it is.e suicide  of a friend or loved one.  This is a mother's story, written from the  depths of her heart, and her love for him really shows.  The tragedy of  Richard's life as she tells it is soul--wrenching, but it's a good  catharsis also.  It's also a testimony to the power of prayer. <br /> I have  one complaint about the book which may sound nitpicky to some, but it  bugged me, so here it is:  On page 117-18, she suggests prayers and  religious material for reading out loud to deceased souls, saying:  &quot;The material must be spiritually inspired, e.g., the New Testament  (especially the Gospel of John), all of Ralph Waldo Emerson's work, the  Bhagavad Gita, biographies of saints.  I chose Rudolf Steiner's work  because he gives the most comprehensive truth about the cosmos and human  being and their connections and purpose.&quot; <br /> OK, so Deverell is an  Anthroposophist, and I can accept that she finds Steiner's work to be  &quot;the most comprehensive&quot; among her suggestions.  And those other  &quot;spiritually inspired&quot; sources are probably good, too. (I'll  assume she skipped the more antisemitic parts of the Gospel of John).  But  notice she names only the NEW Testament as being &quot;spiritually  inspired,&quot; thereby shutting out anything Jewish in the Bible.   HELLO?   Hasn't she ever been inspired by the opening chapters of Genesis?   The Psalms?

Kirk in Star Trek Generations for William Shatner to finally become -- oh no! -- a TREKKIE!  In this candid and hilariously self-depreciating book, Shatner admits that, for all those  years as a cast member, he had been totally clueless about what Trek fandom  was all about.  To find out, he dons a really tacky rubber alien mask in  order to mingle anonymously with the crowd. (The book has photos of him  wearing it -- I wonder how many fans will see them and think, &quot;Oh no!  I was standing right next to Bill and never even got his autograph!&quot;)  When the undercover experiment is over, he has a new respect for what  happens at a Trek convention.  And when he asks the fans what to call the  book, they suggest, &quot;Get a Life!&quot;  So he did.<br /> One of the  funniest parts of the book is in the first chapter, where he describes  going to a typical speaking engagement, from panic on the plane (this  ex-starship captain hates flying!) to being met at the airport by an  enthusiastic fan who invaribly can't find the car, then being driven at top  speed to the convention, where he is smuggled in the back door past the  smelly garbage dumpsters, through the hotel kitchen, then along the  &quot;secret&quot; passageways used by the cleaning staff, to emerge  backstage -- all choregraphed by security teams using codes like &quot;The  Eagle has landed&quot; to try to keep his exact arrival time a secret from  the crowd.  Whew!  No wonder he had to put on a mask to enter the real Trek  universe!  I, for one, am glad he did, because this is a very entertaining  book.	2000-05-23

Reading this book knocked Gene Roddenberry off the  pedestal that I had put him on for so many years -- and that's why it's such an important book for anyone interested in the history of Star Trek.  Basing his research  primarily on interviews, firsthand accounts, studio memos and other source  materials, author Joel Engels dares to go where no biographer had gone  before.  He gives Gene credit where credit is due, but does not shrink from  reporting the less-than-savory sides of his life, too.  The result is a  book that, as the title says, explores both the Myth and the man.<br /> It  was in this unauthorized bio that I first learned of Roddenberry's lifelong  abuse of alcohol and other substances, his deep insecurities about his  writing career, the origins of his animosity toward religion, his  inappropriate fixation on  sex, and the fact that he did not  single-handedly create Star Trek.  In short, he was a fallible human being  with some serious character flaws.  But, as the Myth grew, Gene felt that  he had to mold his public image into the &quot;Star Trek Creator&quot; that  the fans expected him to be.  Unfortunately, in the process, he often  failed to give credit where credit was due, and ended up alienating many of  the actors, writers, and producers who had also contributed to the group  effort that became the Star Trek universe.<br /> One of the most  interesting chapters in this book is about a project for a film called  &quot;The Nine,&quot; in which Roddenberry was hired to write a script  about a skeptic who was investigating a group of psychics that channeled  New-Age type messages  from UFO aliens. (No, I'm not making this up -- it's  in the book!)  As part of the research for this movie, Gene actually  attended a spiritualist retreat for a while, and even got a past-life  reading about what purported to be his previous incarnations.  The script  itself was never produced, but one gets the feeling that Gene had his mind  stretched a bit on paranormal issues.  But, oddly, there is no mention of  &quot;The Nine&quot; in the official biography (Star Trek Creator), except  to list it as an unproduced script in his writing credits.  Which is why,  if you are interested in a balanced understanding of the life of Gene  Roddenberry, you should read BOTH the authorized version and this one.ranormal issues.

This is a story to delight animal lovers of all ages.<br />  I should add here that there is really no &quot;religious custom&quot;  forbidding Jews to have cats (I myself have six of them!)  Appleblossom the  cat tells Naphtali that her father belongs to the rabbi's son -- and if the  rabbi's son has a cat, then it must be permitted!  This is really a story  about a father who personally doesn't care much for cats and is finding  &quot;religious&quot; excuses to say &quot;No cats.&quot;  What Naphtali's  father quotes are really folk superstitions about cats -- and Naphtali's  mother seems to know that, because she wants a cat, too.  Of course, the  reader knows the story will have a happy ending -- with a little bit of  help from Elijah the Prophet (who traditionally settles deadlocked  disputes.)<br /> The watercolor illustrations are filled with light and  spirituality -- I especially love the one of Appleblossom looking down at  Naphtali from the blossoming tree branches.  The one minor  &quot;blooper&quot; that some Jewish families might wonder about is that  Naphtali, although clearly a religious Jew, is wearing shorts -- which was  not the custom among Jews in Eastern Europe where he is supposed to be  living.  But the illustrator herself was born in England, and British  schoolboys do traditionally wear short pants, so this can be probably  explained as being based on what she saw in her own homeland.  (Not a big  issue, but some Jewish children may wonder about it.)<br /> An excellent book  -- I'd give it ten stars if I could.  Order one now for next Passover.	2000-05-07

What Rabbi Green has done is to create a series of creative  lessons about basic Jewish concepts. In the process, he clearly  demonstrates how common words (and some not so common ones!) have very  specific meanings within Judaism, meanings that express the inner  dimensions of the religion, but are often lost in translation.<br /> Judaism  has never worked well in translation, and there was a time when all Jews  learned these words in their original Hebrew contexts.  Nowadays, that is  no longer true, and Jews who are marginal in their Jewish identities often  tend (wrongly) to use the dominant culture's translations of Jewish texts  as the lens through which to read their own religion -- with the disastrous  result of thinking that Judaism has no spirituality.<br /> Rabbi Green's book  helps to correct that misperception.  He explains, for example, that  learning Torah is not just studying the law as an intellectual exercise.  It's an ongoing process of interacting with the sacred texts on a very  personal level.  In that sense, this book, too, is &quot;Torah,&quot; and  when you are done reading it, you will have the necessary vocabulary for  grokking Judaism on both the outer and the inner levels. I highly recommend  this book to anyone -- Jewish or not -- who wants to get a firm grasp on  the basic vocabulary of Judaism.	2000-05-02

But in many ways, even after his conversion ceremony, he still did not FEEL like a Jew.  He had not yet come to the  point of being able to feel Jewish &quot;in his bones&quot; as the Hasidic  masters would say.  So he undertook a personal pilgrimage that would begin  by visiting the sites of the concentration camps, and end in the Holy City  of Jerusalem.  Along the way, he would confront his own fears and joys as  he grappled with the enormity of the Holocaust, and the knots of fear in  his stomach when when he was asked by two drunken Poles if he was an  Israeli...<br /> This book is based on his daily journal from that  pilgrimage.  Holding nothing back, David bares his soul for all to see.  The result is a deeply sensitive testimony to one man's journey, but it is  also one of the most moving pieces of prose I have read in a long time.  He  does not claim to have all the answers, but he asks questions which plumb  the depths of the human heart.<br /> I recommend this book to anyone  contemplating conversion to Judaism, but also to those who were born  Jewish, too.  For Jews who wonder if converts can ever be &quot;real  Jews,&quot; this book answers in the affirmative.  In many ways, David  Patterson, despite his gentile birth, is far more Jewish than many of us  who sometimes take the gift of our Jewishness for granted.	2000-05-01

This Haggadah has the traditional Hebrew text and a modern, clear translation, along with plenty of great supplementary material from Breslov Hasidic sources. Like most Breslov materials, it focuses primarily on using  the teachings of Rebbe Nachman for developing the personal relationship  between human beings and their Creator.<br /> Throughout this Haggadah,  sections of the traditional text are related in the commentary to aspects  of personal growth.  For example, the &quot;Four Sons&quot;(or daughters)  are explained as: (1) The Wise Self -- wisdom with measure; (2)The Wayward  Self -- a reassuring rebuke; (3)The Simple Self-- a simple answer;and (4)  The Sleeping Self-- an awakening of light.  Similarly, the section on  &quot;Dayenu&quot; has a discussion about how singing holy tunes can raise  the soul up to God, while the discussion on  Pharoah sees this character as  &quot;the Inverted Self&quot; that drags us down.  In short, the whole  thrust of this Haggadah is toward inner spiritual liberation.<br /> But make  no mistake -- this is not a &quot;new age&quot; re-write of Judaism.  This  is Orthoodx Judaism at its very, very best.  Rebbe Nachman of Breslov was a  Hasidic master, and, when asked by his disciples what &quot;special  things&quot; they should do as Breslover Hasidim, he replied,  &quot;Whatever is in the Shulchan Arukh (code of Jewish Law).&quot;  In  other words, be halachically-observant Jews. So, when it comes to the  rituals, this Haggadah upholds the traditional form of the ceremony.<br />  But Rebbe Nachman was also aware that Jewish law commands us to &quot;love  God with all you heart and with all your soul and with all your  might,&quot; and it is this aspect which is often neglected in daily life.  So, this Haggadah goes beyond the &quot;Letter of the Law&quot; to draw  upon the deep spirtuality of Rebbe Nachman's about liberation from fear,  depression, greed, confusion, etc. in order to remain focused on God. The  result is a very inspiring book for celebrating Passover -- And a great  resource year-round, too!is a very inspiring book for celebrating Passover -- And a great  resource year-round, too!	2000-04-07

Neither judgemental nor preachy, it is a cross  between personal journal and anthropology, with the author giving her own  thoughts along with the statistics.  Also included are numerous interviews  with Jews, intermarried and not, about their personal experiences.<br /> I  found the chapter &quot;That's Entertainment&quot; -- about images of Jews  in the media -- to be useful as &quot;back up&quot; for what I've been  saying for years:  You rarely, if ever, see a happily married Jewish family  portrayed on TV or in the movies.  It's as if Hollywood thinks that nobody  will be interested in a story about two Jews married to each other.  (Imagine if they showed only black-white marriages on TV -- there's be an  outcry from both sides!)  The author traces the various portrayals of Jews  in the movies and TV, and warns that these are the images which American  Jewish youth are taking as models for themselves.  With no positive  portayals of Jewish family life, is it any wonder they marry non-Jews?<br />  In the end, however, I found the author's stance to be far too permissive  and somewhat pandering to the dominant culture.  She does not, for example,  see any problem with mixed-marriage couples having a Christmas tree, which  she calls &quot;just a decoration.&quot;  And her conclusions in the last  chapter are essentially Reform Movement,  i.e., that intermarraige is here  to stay anyway, so we might as well start blurring the lines between Jews  and non-Jews in the synagogue rituals, etc.  With this, I cannot agree.  (And it may well be the reason this book went out of print so quickly.)  Still, she did give me a lot to think about.  She asks good questons, even  if I don't agree with her answers.	2000-03-31

At the time this book was published in 1987, there were about 35,000 Jews in Germany, most of whom were children of Holocaust survivors. (Today, there are also quite a few Eastern European Jews who came after the Berlin  Wall came down).  Later, when I myself visited Germany in 1997, I had many  conversations similar to those in this book.<br /> &quot;I'm proud to live  with my family in Germany as a religious Jew,&quot; writes one contributor.  &quot;My bags are always packed,&quot; writes another.  Between these two  extremes of comfort and fear, there's a wide spectrum of feelings about  what it is like to be a Jew in Central Europe today.  These are 14  testimonials from German Jews, not as the public would like to see them,  but how they feel in private, in the depths of their hearts and souls. A  troubling, thought-provokng book that is hard to read, but impossible to  put down.	2000-03-31

She won a scholarship to a Nazi school in Prague.  Such an  opportunity was scarcely dreamed of amidst the poverty she had grown up in.  And so, it wasn't ideology or hatred of Jews that drew her to the Hitler  Youth at first.  It was simply that she thought she was being offered the  opportunity of a lifetime -- to get an education.<br /> The banality of this  story is chilling, but also  quite understandable.  When I read this book  ten years ago, I saw for the first time how ordinary people with basically  good hearts got caught up in the Nazi machine.  Hindsight is always 20-20,  but when an event is taking place in our lives, we don't always have the  wisdom to make the right decisions.	2000-03-30

From the beginning of the  book, the reader already knows what the tragic outcome of the story will  be.

The first time I came across this book many years ago, it was in a mimeographed form that I thought was supposed to be a joke -- like &quot;Legends of the Ferengi&quot; and other spoofs on stereotypes.  Sadly, it's not intended as a joke at all.  Also sadly, there are still people around who are being taken in by what may be the biggest hoax of all time.

An amazing book by a wisdom-filled elder of our people! I absolutely loved it!<br /> All too often, the only stories we ever hear about Holocaust survivors are those who lost their faith in God because he supposedly was  &quot;not there&quot; and failed to rescue the Jews. Why be religious, the  skeptics always say, if it doesn't help you to physically survive?<br /> But  for Rebbitzin Jungreis, descendant of an illustrious rabbinic dynasty and a  survivor of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, there is more to life  than mere survival. God is always there, even under the most horrible  conditions that life can throw at us.  The question is not how we die, but  how we live.  As her father taught her -- and she quotes him in the book --  &quot;A long life is not good enough, but a good life is long enough.&quot;<br /> To Rebbitzin Jungreis, the &quot;good life&quot; is not one filled with  material possessions, but rather, a life devoted to God, Torah, and  mitzvahs -- a life filled with hope, forgiveness, joy and love.  Short or  long, such a life is always a good life.<br /> After surviving Bergen-Belsen,  her father, who had been Chief Rabbi of Szeged, Hungary, before the Nazis  came, charged her with a sacred mission:  to help renew the faith in God  among Jews, which the Nazis had tried to destroy. Rebbitzin Jungreis has  devoted her life to doing just that.  Her deep spirituality radiates from  every page of this book -- not the wishy-washy, self-centered form of  &quot;spirituality&quot; so often preached by New Agers nowadays, but the  real thing -- the kind of spirituality that takes hard work -- and which  manifests itself in a life committed to God and service to one's fellow  human beings under any and all circumstances.<br /> I especially liked the  parts where she talks about about doing tikkun olam (repairing the world)  and forgiveness, saying: &quot;To respond to hatred with hated can only  beget further hatred and reduce the world to chaos.  Whenever possible, we  have to try to communicate by using the formual of our father Abraham by  attempting to awaken the Divine spark even in the darkest of souls.&quot;  (p. 38)  Remember, this is from a Holocaust survivor, who personally  experienced the darkest chapter in Jewish history.  But, unlike many Jews  who became embittered and still say &quot;Never forgive,&quot; Rebbitzin  Jungreis does not allow hatred to fester and poison her soul.  Instead, she  lights a candle in the darkness, working to heal broken hearts and rescue  wounded souls from the abyss.<br /> This is a book you will want to read  over and over.  Whatever your own level of religious observance might be,  her personal stories and heartwarming, down-to-earth advice will help you  to lead a more meaningful life.Whenever possible, we  have to try to communicate by using the formual of our father Abraham by  attempting to awaken the Divine spark even in the darkest of souls.&quot;  (p. 38)  Remember, this is from a Holocaust survivor, who personally  experienced the darkest chapter in Jewish history.

Gathered here are 16 research papers by anthropologists and one  psychiatrist, which document Indian beliefs in reincarnation and other  forms of rebirth.  The conculsion?  These beliefs were/are more widespread  among Native Americans that is usually thought.<br /> Surprised?  I certainly  was. Although I had previously run across scattered references to  reincarnation among Indians (such as few short paragraphs in John Lame  Deer's autobiography, &quot;Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions&quot;), I had no  idea the belief in it was so widespread. Like so much else about native  cultures, it appears we have been viewing this aspect through the eyes of  &quot;first contact&quot; Europeans who, because their own belief system(s)  did not allow for reincarnation, failed to recognize it in the Indian  cultures they encountered.<br /> Now for the first time, we can read a fine  collection of studies that clearly document these beliefs in fascinating  detail.  The material is rich in anecdotes about dreams, visions, legends,  Creation myths, and the lives of heros, healers, and shamans.  The book  includes older source material previous gathered -- and now being  re-revaluated -- as well as modern cases where native individuals remember  previous lives.<br /> However, New agers or neo-shamans who want an inspiring  &quot;spirituality&quot; read will probably be disappointed.  And native  Indians themselves might be put off by yet another round of Anglo  anthropologists studying them.  The approach here is quite scholarly, and  the style is post-graduate level research paper -- think &quot;early Ian  Stevenson&quot; (who did, in fact, write one of the articles in the book,  about his research among the Tlinget tribes.)  But for those who are  willing to step into an anthropological mindset for a while, this book will  be a real eye-opener, as well as a valuable source book.  Highly  recommended to any serious student of reincarnation teachings, as well as  anyone interested in shamanism, comparative religion, etc.eye-opener, as well as a valuable source book.

This, too, is included in the new book version.<br /> As can  be expected when somebody claims to be the reincarnation of an historical  figure, Barnes has met with considerable ridicule. But not everyone is a  skeptic.  Research scientist John Wilcox, Ph.D., a mathematician and  physicist at the University of Pennsylvania's Johnson Research Foundation,  heard Barnes describe the bell effect of a collision with Titanic's single  hull and wondered if the theory could be tested by computer simulation.  Based on the physical properties of the steel (now known from samples  brought up from the wreck), the exact dimensions of the ship, and Barnes'  memories of the speed at which she hit the iceberg,  Wilcox created a  computer-generated model that mathematically reproduced the acoustic  energies in Titanic's  hull before and after the collision.  The findings  lend strong support to Barnes' past-life memory of the vibrating hull as a  major factor in the breakup of the ship.  The results of Dr. Wilcox's  simulations, including the diagrams, are included in the book.<br /> I myself  was impressed with Barnes' ability to remember seemingly minor details,  such as the name of the ship's cat, Jenny.  (Now there's a piece of trivia  for you -- remember that for your next quiz show!) In addition to the cat,  publisher Linda Nathanson, in her appendix to the book, lists 23 other  verifiable reference points.  Plus,  there is a section on &quot;Science  versus Past-Life Memories,&quot; which presents various scientific data on  the brittle composition of the steel, recent experiments with scale models,  and results of sonar scannings of Titanic's wreck by the Discovery  Communications Expedition -- all of which support what Bill remembers from  his life as Tommie.<br /> The result is one of the most convincing cases  for reincarnation that I have seen in my 20+ years of writing on this  topic.

I originally bought this book in connection with a writing project (still in progress) regarding possibly Jewish characters in the Star Trek universe.  And yes, there *is* such a reference in &quot;Strangers in the Sky&quot; -- check out pages 228-29, where Professor Grayson (an ancestor  of Amanda Grayson, Spock's mother), is wearing a yarmulke (Jewish  skullcap).  He then explains to Spock that he is really only an  &quot;honorary Jew&quot; for having married his wife Dora -- who, we can  assume from that remark, really is Jewish.  Apparently the Graysons were  not very observant of other Jewish traditions, however, because the  Professor then offers Spock BACON and eggs (which he, being a vegetarian,  declines.)  Nevertheless, the implication here is, that Spock had a Jewish  ancestor on his mother's human side.<br /> Aside from this interesting little  tidbit for my own research, I found the book itself to be a very good read.  Yes, it was longer than many of the newer Trek novels being produced  today, but in my opinion, that was its strength.  (Remember, folks,  &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is also a very long book, and although Lily had not  actually read it in &quot;First Contact,&quot; Captain Picard obviously  had!)<br /> The extra length of &quot;Strangers&quot; gave the author enough  room to really develop the characters and go into some detail about the  issues of fear, prejudice, and distrust that would be involved in first  contact with aliens.  And, like some of the other reviewers here, I like  the way that Ms. Nonanno picked up on some of the early characters in the  TOS series and told us about some of their accomplishments before getting  killed off in &quot;Where no Man Has Gone Before.&quot;<br />  Live long and prosper!	2000-02-16

The current Schocken  edition,  with both volumes together in one binding, is a very good deal --  I paid a whole lot more for my two-volume set three decades ago.<br />  Although Buber himself was not a Hasid (he was an existentialist  philosopher who developed an interest in Hasidism later in life), he does a  good job of conveying the spirit of these stories.  In my opinion, this  collection is a must-have for anybody telling Hasidic stories.<br /> The book  is not so much a collection of &quot;tales&quot; in the sense of literary  stories or fairy tales, as it is a collection of personal anecdotes about  the lives of various Hasidic masters.  Some of the tales are  fully-developed narratives, but others are terse fragments that remind the  reader of Zen koans, those &quot;sound of one hand clapping&quot; riddles  which one can meditate upon for years before the great &quot;Aha!&quot;  hits and you suddenly &quot;get it.&quot;<br />  My only complaint is that  the English  translation leaves much to be desired in many places, so that,  if one is not already familiar with Hasidism, the point of some of the  stories can easily be misunderstood.  Part of this is due to Buber's  original renditions into German, where his search for the right literary  German word sometimes confused the Jewish meanings because there simply are  no exact equivalents.  (As, for example, rendering the verb &quot;to  mikveh&quot; -- immerse oneself in a pool of water for ritual purification  -- as &quot;tauchen&quot; (baptism).<br /> Unfortunately, some of these types  of linguistic errors got carried over into the English translation.  I  would really like to see a new translation done by a Hasid who knows modern  English.  But until then, this version remains an excellent sourcebook for  traditional Hasidic tales.	2000-02-04

His  faithful disciple, Rabbi  Chaim Vital, recorded his master's teachings in  several books which have come down to us.  One of these is &quot;Sha'ar  Gilgulim&quot;  (The Gate of Reincarnations,&quot;) which forms the basis  of the book I am now reviewing.  Although &quot;The Gate of  Reincarnations&quot; is a fundamental source text for Jewish mystics and  scholars, until now, it was only available in Hebrew.<br /> Rabbi Wexelman's  book is the first I known of to present substantial amounts of material  from  &quot;The Gate of Reincarnations&quot; in English.  He has also  included a second section, &quot;The Kabbalistic Concept of Creation,&quot;  which is based on two other works by Chaim Vital, the &quot;Sha'ar  ha-Hakdamot&quot; and the &quot;Otsrot Hayim.&quot;  Together, they give a  fine presentation of the Arizal's teachings on the spiritual journey of the  human soul.<br /> But, as the subtitle says, this book is &quot;based  on&quot;  the writings of Chaim Vital.  As such, it is not a complete  word-for-word translation. As Rabbi Wexelman himself states in his  introduction, he has &quot;omitted sections that would cause confusion due  to problems of translating difficult concepts suitable only for more  advanced learners.&quot;  At the same time, he has also &quot;tried not to  distort the meaning and ideas or to add [his] own thoughts on these  topics.&quot;  The result is a redaction that presents the basics of  Vital's work in a form that is accessible to the educated English-speaking  student of Jewish mysticism.  (However, I myself would have prefered a  complete translation.)<br /> The book explains the five levels of the human  soul, how souls come to be reincarnated, how the 613 mitzvot relate to the  613 parts of the spiritual body, the phenomenon of &quot;ibbur&quot;  (temporary benign possession), soulmates, etc.  Especially interesting are  the sections on &quot;who was who,&quot; which trace the various  incarnations of biblical and Talmudic personalities, according to the  insights of Vital's master, the Arizal.  (In addition to being a great  kabbalist, the Arizal was also a type of &quot;past-life reader&quot; who  could see all the previous incarnations of a person and prescribe the  proper &quot;tikkun&quot; or soul correction for each person.)<br /> Make  no mistake, however: this is not an intro  how-to book on reincarnation.  The original text was intended for advanced rabbinic scholars who were  already steeped in Jewish law, kabbalah, and Orthodox Jewish practices for  many years, and it assumes you have that background.  It also assumes a  working knowledge of specialized kabbalistic terms in Hebrew, such as the  Four Worlds, the Sefirot and their different combinations, levels of the  soul, etc.  One glaring weakness of the book is that it has no glossary.  Nor does it have any biographical materials on the various rabbis who's  incarnations are recorded.  If you don't already know Jewish history, they  are only so many names.<br /> So, I give this book five stars for what it is:  a good redaction of an advanced kabbalistic source text in English.  As  such, it will be very useful to the advanced student.  However, for the  general reader who doesn't want to plow through so many technical terms, I  would recommend Rabbi DovBer Pinson's book, &quot;Reincarnation in Judaism:  the Journey of the Soul,&quot; instead.

I have been recommending this book ever since it first came out in 1996.  Why? Because it clearly demonstrates that, contrary to popular ideas of reincarnation and karma, we do not come back as the &quot;opposite&quot;  of what we once were.  The 12 people regressed by Dr. Lane were apparently  attracted to Civil War renencting because it was  FAMILIAR from the  previous life.  In other words,  &quot;like attracts like&quot; from one  life to the next.<br /> Although there are some places where the book  gets a  bit repetitious, one cannot fault the careful examination of details and  the enormous amount of historical research that went into this work.  Most  impressive were a number of instances where the past-life memories seemed  &quot;wrong&quot; according to what the re-enactors thought they  &quot;should be,&quot; but were later shown to be accurate  according  actual historical records.<br /> Another interesting point is that, although  the subjects were quite knowledgeable about the Civil War while in the  waking state, they were unable to predict the outcome of a battle when they  were actually &quot;in&quot; the memories under hypnosis.  Nor could they  &quot;change history&quot; during the regression sessions as one might do  in a dream or fantasy.  This convinced me that these were not fantasies  about the Civil War, but actual memories of having been there in another  life.	2000-01-13

As soon as I discovered this book, I immediately linked it to my homepage, as well as my Jewish resource menus and online FAQs.  It fills a very real need for a user-friendly basic Judaism book that is  &quot;accessible&quot; to the rank beginner, and I find myself recommending  it a LOT to web surfers and readers of my own books who email me with their  &quot;Judaism 101&quot; questions.<br /> This book is much, much better  than Steinberg's old standby, &quot;Basic Judaism,&quot; which is just too  much stuffy academe for the average reader of today.  Rabbi Blech's use of  the familiar 'Idiot's Guide&quot; format is non-threatening, and even uses  some humor to make learning about Judaism easy and fun!<br /> I recommend  this book to non-Jews who want the basics, to Jews who need to brush up on  what they might have missed as kids in Hebrew school, and especially to  school teachers and librarians as a quick reference to those common  questions about what Jews believe in, what happens in a synagogue service,  and &quot;Why do they do that...?&quot;<br /> Thank you, Rabbi Blech, for a  great educational resource!	2000-01-07

This excellent book really deserves to be much better known than it is.  I didn't find it until nine years after publication, and now that I have, I'm recommending it to everyone I know who is interested in the  Holocaust.  Pesach Schindler does an excellent job of presenting a  perspective that, until now, has mostly been overlooked by secular  Holocaust scholars.  This pioneering historical study gives us the Hasidic  side of the story, which challenges some commonly-held misconceptions about  how Orthodox Jews reacted to Hitler.<br /> In the popular mind, Hasidic Jews  (and Orthodox Jews in general) are often seen as cowards who did not fight  back, and are usually written off as &quot;useless&quot; or  &quot;obsolete&quot; by the Zionist movement for not having grabbed guns to  kill the Nazis.  But in &quot;Hasidic Responses,&quot; the reader learns  that many Hasidic Jews *did* resist the Nazis -- not with guns, but by  drawing on the inner strength of Hasidic teachings about the ultimate  goodness of God, the honor and privilege or martyrdom, and the value of  sanctifying every moment of life through Torah and mitzvot.  Hopefully,  this book will help change the common misconception that the Orthodox  &quot;went like sheep to the slaughter.&quot;<br /> The author presents a  variety ways that Hasidic Jews actively responded to the Holocaust, and  explores some of the moral and theological reasons they acted as they did.  He points out that many Hasidim resisted through non-violent  non-cooperation and refusal to obey Nazi decrees,  because to do so would  mean to violate the laws of their faith.  For example, there is no record  of any Orthodox Jew ever being a &quot;capo&quot; or overseer in the  concentration camps.  The Hasidim took very seriously the commandment to  love their neighbors as themselves, and therefore felt it was immoral and  forbidden to curry favor with the guards at the expense of their fellow  prisoners.<br /> When the round-ups first began, the Hasidic Jews actively  refused to name fellow Jews or give away their hiding places -- and many  paid with their lives for that refusal.  Others simply decided not to  register with the Nazis at all, and went into hiding, refusing to wear the  yellow star or show up for &quot;selections.&quot;  These underground  Hasidim continued to study Torah, wear Hasidic garb, and practice their  faith even though it was now forbidden.  Yes, they understood that they  would be killed if discovered, but they also understood that everyone dies  sometime, and that it's better to die with one's integrity intact than to  survive at the expense of human decency.<br /> As a Hasidic Jew myself, it  is my hope that readers of this book will come to understand that the  Hasidim who died in the Holocaust -- many by taking stands for their faith  and refusing to be dehumanized -- were true martyrs, not the helpless  victims they are so often portrayed to have been.

What I liked best about this book -- and what, for me, sets it apart from so many similar inspirational works -- is that it includes some stories with openly Jewish content.  Not that miracle stories really have  &quot;denominations&quot; per se, but for some reason, the stories about  Jews having these types of experiences never seem to make it into  collections for the general public without being &quot;universalized&quot;  into generic pablum. The result is that the public -- Jews and gentiles  alike -- get the mistaken impression that miracles never happen to  modern-day Jews.<br /> Not so with &quot;Small Miracles.&quot;  The authors  have unabashedly included several anecdotes about Jews experiencing  miraculous &quot;coincidences,&quot; the same as their Christian neighbors.  My favorite is the one about the rabbi and nine followers whose plane  &quot;just happened&quot; to need refueling in a small village where the  lone resident Jew needed a minyan (prayer quorum) to say kaddish (prayer  for the dead) for his father.  The father's spirit, it turns out, had  appeared to his son in a dream the previous night and promised that, if the  non-religious son would say kaddish, then he, the father, would provide the  minyan!<br /> The Yiddish word for these types of miraculous coincidences is  &quot;bashert,&quot; which, roughly translated, means &quot;it was meant to  be&quot; or &quot;it was guided by Heaven.&quot;  For everyone who reads  this book, these &quot;bashert&quot; stories will surely warm the heart and  soul.

This book was first written back in the '60's and  published in the early 70's, when so many Jews  were going to Eastern religions in search of the  spirituality that (they thought) was not in Judaism.  At that point in time, there was --  hard as it is to believe now -- very little  material  available about Jewish mysticism for the popular-level English reader.  Seekers either  had to struggle through the post-Ph.D.-level heaviness of  Gershom Scholem's academic style, or  learn Hebrew and read the source  texts.  Either was a daunting task for the casual seeker who just  wanted  some authentic info about kabbalah and how  the Jewish mystics practiced  its forms of meditation, etc..<br />  Enter Perle Epstein (now Perle  Besserman). She  was already doing a series on the various forms of  mysticism, and had already covered Buddhism, Zen, etc., so she decided her  next project would be  on the mysticism of her own Jewish background.<br />  (As an interesting aside: Like so many assimilated Jews of that era,  Epstein came to mysticism and  meditation through yoga and Hinduism first,  and was not a religious Jew when she began the  &quot;Kabbalah&quot;  project. So, she had a two-fold struggle: (1) to find the teachings, and  (2) to  confront her own issues and stereotypes about the  Orthodox Jews  she was interviewing. The personal  story of these struggles and how she  collected the  material for &quot;Kabbalah&quot; is told in  &quot;Pilgrimage: Adventures of a Wandering Jew&quot; which, as far as I  know, is out of print but well worth tracking down a copy.)<br /> The  influence of her Eastern studies and practical experience with Hindu gurus  and Zen masters can be seen in &quot;Kabbalah,&quot; such as the way she  describes the 16th-century Safed community of Rabbi Isaac Luria as a  &quot;Jewish Shangri-la&quot; and a sort of ashram community, -- which, in  a sense, it was.  This made the teachings very understandable  people who  were already familiar with the Eastern  forms of meditation.  In fact, it  was the first  popular book I know of that clearly identified some of the  practices as forms of visualization,  use of mantras, etc.<br /> In my  opinion, these types of cross-cultural comparisons are very helpful to Jews  (and others)  who want an introduction to how Jewish mysticism has been  practiced down through the centuries.  The book is not an academic tome,  but is written  in a clear popular, almost poetic style that I  found a  delight to read the first time around, and have returned to again and  again.  For many years  during the 70's and 80's, this book  was my #2  recommendation to Jewish beginners in kabbalah,  as well as non-Jews  wanting to know something  about our spirituality.

As the \\"Rabbi Gershom\\" who is covered in a chapter of MacKenzie's book, I was amazed (and dare I say flattered?) to discover that I have been promoted to the status of a \\"reincarnation master,\\" a  claim I myself have never made. (And which, to a traditional Jew like me,  sounds a bit  over-inflated, because I'm not used to the honorifics of  the East!) So of course, being only human, I turned right away to the  chapter on me!<br /><br /> I found that, in many places, MacKenzie had  reconstructed (and sometimes paraphrased) the interview from a combination  of material I had said in person, with material taken directly from my  first book, [[ASIN:0876042930 Beyond the Ashes: Cases of Reincarnation from the Holocaust]]  The result reads a bit unevenly, and there were places  where her paraphrasing put some vocabulary into my mouth that I don't  normally use. This can be excused in the name of making esoteric material  accessible,\\" but it was a bit disconcerting.  I found myself wondering  if she had done the same thing with the other interviews. How accurately  do they convey the actual words of the monks and tulkus, I wondered?<br /><br />  Still, this criticism on my part is probably the nitpickiness of one  journalist critiquing another, and I found the overall presentation to be  interesting. Especially the idea that souls from highly-disciplined  practices (such as Tibetan Buddhism or, in my case, Hasidic-Orthodox  Judaism) seem to pick up where they left off in the last life, and that it  can take multiple lifetimes in  the same path in order to really master it.  The Hasidic masters would agree that one cannot really know a spiritual  practice, in the deepest sense, from the experiences of only one lifetime.<br /><br /> The cases that MacKenzie described were also very interesting to me,  where the reincarnated children (tulkus) recognized people and objects from  the past life. I have found many similar cases within the Jewish community,  of American children born into secularized families who have a strong  \\"feel\\" for the Eastern European forms of Judaism, with attraction  to the music, foods, etc. as well as the religion itself. I have even  argued that one of the reasons for the resurgence of Hasidism in the past  two decades is because the people who were killed in the Holocaust have now  reincarnated in America.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, in the case of the European  Jews, so few survived the Holocaust that there were rarely living  individuals from the previous life who could verify the children's memories  in the same way that the monks in MacKenzie's book recognized the tulkus.  For an entire generation, the disciplic succession of Jewish mystics was  interrupted, with few, if any, elders to re-train the reincarnates. Many of  the returning Jewish souls -- including myself -- felt \\"lost\\" in  the West in their early years and did not find their way back to  traditional communities  until adulthood -- if at all. (sigh)<br /><br /> I was  happy to read that such is not the case in Tibetan Buddhism, where the  continuity of the monastic tradition was not broken by exile from Tibet.  Enough of the leaders, including the Dalai Lama himself, escaped the  Communists to \\"be there\\" for the tulkus when they returned in new  bodies, making it much easier for such a child to simply go into a  monastery at an early age and continue being a Buddhist.  This gave me a  lot of useful insights into my own work in the Jewish community, and the  enormous amount of healing and community-building that needs to happen for  helping the wounded and confused Jewish souls that are reincarnating in the  West.<br /><br /> Unlike some of the reviewers here, I did not feel that MacKenzie  was talking down to me at all. I know a good deal about Hasidism and its  teachings on reincarnation, but very little about Tibetan Buddhism, so I  found the intro-level explanations very helpful. Without them, I might have  missed a lot of the parallels withmy own traditions.<br /><br /> I came away from  the book with a good feeling, impressed that two cultures which seem so  outwardly different could have similar teachings aobut rebirth, and such  devotion to multi-incarnational spiritual practices.  Her book also  supports my own theory that we do not come back as \\"the opposite\\"  of what we were in the last life.

I originally bought this book for its excellent chapter onreincarnation (gilgul), while researching my own book, &quot;JewishTales of Reincarnation&quot; (Jason Aronson, 1999.)  And indeed, Scholem's book is well worth the price for this chapter alone.<br /> But in addition, I was pleasantly surprised to find that &quot;Godhead&quot; was not only clear and readable about reincarnation, it also explained basic concepts like the astral body, the Tzaddik, Shekhinah, soul groups, reincarnation, etc. more openly than in any of his better-known works.<br /> While Scholem had mentioned the existence of Jewish reincarnation teachings in such works as &quot;Kabbalah&quot; and &quot;Sabbetai Zevi,&quot; it was only in passing, and he did not go into any depth there about how reincarnation works, or how central it is to the kabbalistic understanding of the universe.  In &quot;Godhead,&quot; he does.<br /> In the chapter on &quot;The Righteous One&quot; (Tzaddik), he also explains the Jewish equivalent of &quot;soul groups,&quot; i.e., how souls are connected to a particular Tzaddik (holy teacher), who, in turn, is connected to a higher soul group that is, in turn, connected to the mystical &quot;body&quot; of Adam Kadmon, the archetypal soul of all humanity.  This is, of course, a central concept within Hasidism, which draws many of its teachings from kabbalah..<br /> The accessibility of this book is also due to the excellent translation by Joachim Neugroschel, who uses more &quot;new age&quot; English terms, such as correctly translating &quot;tselem&quot; as &quot;astral body&quot; instead of &quot;image,&quot; which makes the book and its concepts accessible to modern readers.  But the difference between this and earlier Scholem works goes beyond that. As Joseph Dan explains in the introduction to &quot;Godhead,&quot; many of Scholem's first lectures focused on the problems mystics encountered within mainstream Judaism.  So, for example, in &quot;On The Kabbalah and its Symbolism,&quot; a great deal of space is devoted to discussing theological conflicts between kabbalists and mainstream Judaism as to how they understood the Torah, etc..  (I found myself wondering if this focus in his early works was partly due to Scholem's own struggle to see his field accepted in the world of academe.)<br /> In &quot;Godhead,&quot; however, we read a series of lectures where Scholem has moved beyond the apologetics, to present us with basic concepts of kabbalah in a confident, straightforward manner.  The same level of careful academic scholarship is there, to be sure, but the focus is not on convincing us that kabbalah is something worth studying.  Rather, it is on helping us to understand how our souls were created, how they reincarnate, and how they complete their &quot;tikkun&quot; (soul repair), within a Jewish context.<br /> This book immediately became my favorite among the Scholem books, and I highly recommend it to any serious student of reincarnation studies or kabbalah.

As an Orthodox Jew, I naturally have certain  reservations about recommending a Reform book,  especially one that says you can just sort of  make up your own level of Shabbat observance as you go along.  I guess you  would have to call me the &quot;traditionalist&quot; among the smorgasbord  of pick-and-choose choices the authors offer for how Reform Jews observe  Shabbat.<br />Now, having said that, I think the book can still be a useable  gate for the absolute beginner, coming from a secular or Reform background,  who is trying to bring Shabbat observance into the home.  It does have good  &quot;how-to&quot; instructions for the home rituals, non-sexist  translations, and clear transliterations of the Hebrew text.  I was  pleasantly surprised to see that the how-tos for the rituals are very  traditional, reflecting, perhaps, the recent movement within Reform to  introduce more Hebrew into the service and more observance into the  home.<br />Plus it has the written music for the blessings and songs around  the table, and there are nice explanations of some of the &quot;whys&quot;  for the traditions, such as why we have two candles, etc.<br />All of which  makes it an appealing reference for the non-Orthodox Jew who is trying to  explore Shabbat but does not want anything &quot;too heavy.&quot;  I  especially liked the relaxed, user-friendly writing style.  (My Orthodox  brethren could learn a lesson here, because, sad to say, many Orthodox book  in English are just too academic and formal, making them inaccessible to  the rank beginner.)<br />At the same time, because it takes the Reform  approach, tending to see Judaism as a man-made culture rather than a  divinely-revealed religion, it doesn't really go into much depth about the  halachic (Jewish law) details for observing Shabbat, nor does it stress our  obligation to God to observe it, etc.<br />So, if I may use an analogy,  &quot;Gates of Shabbat&quot; is more like a fast-food burger, rather than a  full Sabbath meal.<br />My advice would be to use the how-to instructions  for making the blessings and singing the songs, and regard the various  &quot;models&quot; as essays for helping you to examine your own  relationship to God, Judaism, and Shabbat as you evolve toward greater  levels of observance.  Once you are really inside the Gate, you'll need  other resources as well, to deepen your learning.Sabbath meal.  <br />My advice would be to use the how-to instructions  for making the blessings and singing the songs, and regard the various  &quot;models&quot; as essays for helping you to examine your own  relationship to God, Judaism, and Shabbat as you evolve toward greater  levels of observance.

The authors  explore a  variety of beliefs about life after death from different periods and  branches of Judaism.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a section on  reincarnation, acknowledging that Hasidim and some others believe in it.<br />All in all, although the book takes a more rationalist approach than I  would prefer, it does give the average reader a nice introduction to Jewish  afterlife doctrines.  Best of all, it's short and very reader-friendly.	1999-08-03

The main thing I want to add to the reviews here  is that there really is no custom to raise a child &quot;in silence&quot; as Reb Saunders does with his  son in the book.  This was a literary device used by Potok for the  sake of his story.  In real life, Hasidic fathers and sons interact with  each other outside of study classes, too.<br />For those of you who find the  use of Yiddish and  Hebrew words a bit off-putting, or the details of  a  strange (to you) culture boring, I want to  say, please keep reading.  Learning about somebody else's culture is always a brain-stretcher, but  in  this case, it is well worth it.  The seemingly  &quot;extraneous&quot;  details in the beginnig of the book all come together in the end.  And you  will be very much enriched by the experience.	1999-08-03

With all the talk about angels lately, this book should be required reading for every Jew.  In this thin but profound volume, Rabbi Steinsaltz, coming from an authentic position within both Orthodoxy and kabbalah,  clearly explains the Jewish conception of angels and how they work on the  four kaobbalistic levels of Action, Formation, Creation, and Emanation.  Also explained is how the mitzvahs we do create new angels to raise up the  universe's energy, and how a sin (heaven forbid) can drag the universal  energies down.  He then ties it all together by giving us a beautiful  interpetation of the kiddush (wine blessing) ritual.  After reading this  book, you will never think of Torah as &quot;mere laws&quot; again!	1999-07-28

As a Breslover Hasid who has made the pilgrimage to Uman, Ukraine and almost moved to Postville,  Iowa (both Hasidic communities described in the book)I found myself chuckling with recoognition  when I read &quot;Boychiks  in the Hood.&quot;<br />It was interesting to see how a secular  &quot;tourist&quot; (albeit a Jewish one) had experienced Hasidic culture  from the outside looking in.  His passport into this world was the fact  that he spoke Yiddish and came from Hasidic stock, which enabled him to  establish an immediate rapport even though he was not religiously  observant.<br />The author's down-homey, man-on-the-street approach was  refreshing, too, in that he tried to show the Hasidim as real people with  individual personalities and differing opinions, not a monolith of black  coats and hats.<br />At the same time, the book suffers from the  same  problems inherent in many travelogues,  namely, that the author, as a  visitor to a foreign culture, was not always sure exactly what he was  looking at.  And while the &quot;man on the street&quot; might provide  color and interesting conversation, he doesn't always &quot;get it  right.&quot;  The result is a book which could be misleading to someone not  familar with the wider context in which some of the remarks are being made.  Still, I did enjoy it, and would recommend it as an interesting read.	1999-07-27

This book was first published back in 1968, and I have referred to my old, worn, second-hand copy again and again in my own writing about Hasidic stories.  One of the earliest studies of Hasidism in America, it includes  material collected right after WWII, from the last generation of Jews to  actually experience the pre-Holocaust Hasidic culture in Eastern Europe.<br />There are Hasidic stories in this book that appear nowhere else,  including some about the Holocaust  that would be considered  &quot;politically incorrect&quot; today -- which is one of the things that  makes the book so valuable.  Mintz did not attempt to censor his subjects,  nor did he try to polish up their storytelling styles.  These are  field-collected  stories in all their original candor.  The result is a  book that speaks to us across the decades.	1999-07-20

The author, Dr. Lynn Kear, Ph.D., has done a monumental job of collecting together literally hundreds of footnoted  references to reincarnation and homosexuality -- a worthy task which, as  far as I know, has never been done before.  This alone makes the book worth  buying, as a valuable reference for anyone in the reincarnation field.<br />However, don't expect this section of the book to be an inspiring  bedtime read.  The style is more like a thesis, with copious footnotes and  language leaning heavily toward academe.  The author's two previous works  were annotated bibliographies, and her skill in that area is evident here,  too.<br />Those who prefer more human interest may want to read the second  half of the book first.  In the second half, there are 11 interviews with  lesbians and gay males who believe in reincarnation, and who express a wide  range of beliefs about how that is connected to their sexuality and their  lives in  general.  Not surprizingly, the gay perspectives  on  reincarnation are just as varied as those in the non-gay world.<br />In the  conclusion, the author, herself a lesbian, explores what this study meant  to her own spiritual search.  Although she is not totally convinced of the  reality of reincarnation, she finds it a fascinating topic as one of the  many ways that spirituality expresses itself.<br />My main complaint about the  book is that the typsetting layout in the first half leaves much to be  desired.  It follows the indentation format of an academic thesis, which  works on a typewritten page, but is difficult to read in the smaller font  of a printed book.  Inserting a space above and below the quoted-indent  paragraphs would have made it much easier on the eyes.<br />Still, this is a  relatively minor point compared to the value of the information this book  contains.  I highly recommend it for both gay and reincarnation studies.udies.	1999-07-20

The author's goal wasn't to solve the mysteries of  life, but to present a  case of reincarnation  where the past-life details could actually be  verified.  In that, he succeeded.<br />Also interesting was the repeated  pattern of Grace's previous incarnations, where the same souls re-played  the same roles many times.  This is in sharp contrast to the popular  misconception that we supposedly &quot;flip-flop&quot; back and forth  between victim and oppressor roles.  The case of Grace suggests that this  is not the case.  Instead, we often repeat what is familiar to us.	1999-07-20

On the one hand, it was clear that the  people who shared this experience together got  healing and grew closer together from it.  But  as to what that experience really  was, that's another question altogether.<br />Although I believe in  reincarnation, I'm also a person who wants to see some documentation that  fits the historical facts.  There were just too many discrepancies between  the &quot;tribe&quot; as Cunningham described it, and the real Oglala  (Lakota Sioux) people I lived among in South Dakota.  The &quot;Indian  ceremonies&quot; she describes are not very authentic, either.<br />One  could argue that &quot;times have changed&quot; and the current ceremonies  are not what the Natives did 200 years ago.  But how do we reconcile a  hereditary Chief as described in &quot;A Tribe Returned&quot; with the real  Oglala people, who had no such social structure?  (And they didn't have  &quot;princesses,&quot; either.)<br />Also, if the channeled portrait of  &quot;Mother Earth&quot;  on the cover is wearing Oglala clothing, then she  is cross-dressed!  The style shirt and beadwork is definitely a man's  pattern.  Equally puzzling was a reference to blue-coated soldiers in what  was supposed to be the 1700's.  There were no U.S.  soldiers in Indian  country at that time, but if  they had been, they would have been dressed  more like George Washington, not U.S. Cavalry.<br />It is my impression that  the &quot;tribe&quot; may well  have been a group fantasy. (The author  herself  raises that possibility.)  This does not negate  the value of the  group therapy that took place  among the tribe's members, but I am very  skeptical  that this was really a case of a Native tribe returned.  Unless  that tribe happens to be the  one that the Native peoples call  &quot;Wannabees.&quot;	1999-07-20

Rabbi Heschel explain so clearly how Jewish  spirituality is expressd, not in visible cathedrals, art, or monuments, but  in timeless words and values as they are expressed in community through  both worship and daily life.<br />Originally written in 1949, it appears that  the author, himself a Holocaust survivor, intended this book to be a  memorial to a lost world.  Yet 50 years later, the book is as fresh and  inspiring as the day it was written.  The physical Jewish world he  describes may no longer be there in Eastern Europe, but the inner world of  religious Jews continues to grow and flourish so that I, as a Hasid in the  90's, can read this book and say, &quot;Yes, this describes my inner life,  too!&quot; .<br />Perhaps, as Heschel himself suggests, this Eastern  European &quot;golden age&quot; of Jewish spirituality (his words) can now  be fully appreciated by the world.

Of course not -- Rabbi Klingerman is just a fictional character, right?<br /><br />Well, yes and no.<br /><br />True, his appearance and personality are not a bit  like me -- I'm a small-boned, fastidious person who *never* goes around  spontaneously hugging people!  So in that sense, the overweight, bombastic,  rumpled Rabbi Klingerman in the novel is definitely *not* me!<br /><br />On the  other hand, I *am* the famous rabbi who  has written two non-fiction books  about cases of reincarnation from the Holocaust period ([[ASIN:0876042930 Beyond the Ashes: Cases of Reincarnation from the Holocaust]]  and [[ASIN:0876043406 From Ashes to Healing: Mystical Encounters With the Holocaust]] -- and I am  the only such rabbi on earth, as far as I know.  So there is at least a  superficial resemblance.  Plus, he  lives in a small town north of  Milwaukee, and I live in a small town north of Minneapolis...<br /><br />So,  naturally, I was more than curious to see how Thomas Monteleone would  handle a novel inspired, at least in part, by my own reincarnation  work.<br /><br />In terms of plot, suspense, and surprising twists, I found NIGHT OF  BROKEN SOULS to be a very good read.  Even though I am more familiar with  the topic than the average reader might be, there were still enough  surprises to keep me on the edge of my seat.  The plots and sub-plots were  exciting, and the nightmares, flashbacks, and past-life regressions seemed  authentic, too.  And the ending was absolutely superb!<br /><br />Unfortunately,  this excellence of story line was  marred by the fact that the author did  not do his homework concerning details about orthodox Jews and Judaism in  general.  There were a number of glaring bloopers that I found most  annoying, including the fact that Purim is *not* a harvest festival, and an  orthodox rabbi would never be DOWN ON HIS KNEES while praying -- because  Jews do not kneel!<br /><br />It was also disappointing that we never seem to get  beyond Rabbi Klingerman's sloppy physical appearance to know him as more  than a \\"fat Jew\\" who has \\"a good heart\\" but is not  taken very seriously by the rest of the characters in the book. My  impression was that the author felt he needed the rabbi character for the  plot, but simply did not know much about orthodox Jews as real people.  So  he used a sort of \\"Tevye\\" template which resulted in a buffoon.  Imitation may be the greatest form of flattery, but in this case, I found  myself a bit insulted by this shallow sterotyped character.<br /><br />Monteleone  also seemed to confuse Orthodox Jews with the Amish, making several  puzzling references to women dressed in \\"subdued colors\\" and  neigborhood shops with \\"old time handcrafts\\" that were not  authentic at all. In the real world, Orthodox Jewish women wear bright  colors and fine jewelery, and their husbands are more likely to sell  electronics than do hand carpentry.<br /><br />But perhaps the most serious  blooper is where the author has his Jewish psychopath-in-the-making  describe how he had hunted and tortured wild animals, then brought home the  kills -- including rabbits and wolves -- to a rabbi's house for dinner, for  which the rabbi was supposedly VERY GRATEFUL!  Apparently Mr. Monteleone is  unaware that religious Jews do not hunt, nor would they eat these species  of animals, because they are not kosher -- making this a totally absurd  scene.  Any Jewish student who brought his rabbi dead wild animals would be  seen as a grievous sinner, if not a total pervert.<br /><br />So, in the end, I  would give this book five stars for a good plot, but only two stars for  Jewish authenticity -- which averages out to about three stars.
