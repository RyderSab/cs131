Now, everything is deathly serious and I'm having trouble enjoying Crais' books as much.  It's a pity, too, because he's a good writer. It seems like, from time to time, writers write really great books and then get \\"serious\\" about their craft not realizing that the humor leavens the work and without it the writing pulls the reader down.  This book puts people close and dear to Elvis in proximity to dangerous, evil people, subject matter much too grim for no smiles at all.	2005-03-09

My one complaint was that it seemed a bit uneven with regard to depth of coverage given to each residence.

This book would have benefitted greatly from slash and burn editing. It started with such promise. The chapter on Pizarro's conquest of the Incas was fascinating. It was pretty easy reading. The summary of the beginnings of agriculture and animal domestication, with references to landscape and climate, were also interesting. I felt like a lot of the rest of the book was beating us over the head with repeats of the same information. How many times do we need to be told that the Chinese invented the wheelbarrow or that Mesoamerica had the wheel but didn't use it for transportation? I feel the pain of professors who assign a page limit on papers and have to wade through filler students use to pad them out to the required page limit.

At times, conversations are layered into story telling so the reader is kept uncertain of who's speaking.  This echoes the uncertainty of the times the people in the book are experiencing. The harsh conditions of the Andes, with its thin air, dried vegetation, freezing nights and burning sun serve as a backdrop for the gripping story of cruelty, death, politics and sorcery.  Colonel Lituma is driven to find the fate of three people who have disappeared from the camp.  He knows he probably doesn't really want to know what happened, but he has to investegate to satisfy his curiosity.  I was completely under the spell of this book and will be looking to read more of this author.	2002-01-21

Along the way, he searches out people who knew Hemmingway, places he ate, drank, slept and wrote and adventures such as the running of the bulls at Pamplona, big game hunting in Africa and fishing in the Gulf Stream. Palin's observations and comments, woven together with quotes from Hemmingway's books and letters made this a travel book with something extra, especially for the Hemmingway fan.

According to Castro, a gusano (worm) is someone who disagrees with his version of the revolution.  This journey of 10,000 miles, through Argentina, Chile, Peru and Bolivia, retraces, in part, the path of Ernesto (Che) Guevera on a motorcycle trip he took in 1952 which was influential in shaping his convictions and the rest of his life.  Along the way, Symmes meets people who knew Che, visits places where he stayed and ends his journey in the spot, in Bolivia, where Guevera met his end.  The book begins and ends in Cuba where the spark was ignited to uncover the man inside the legend.  Symmes meets a man who asks him to \\"tell people how it really is\\".<br />By the time he returns to Cuba, a year after his journey, for Che's funeral, Symmes has come to see Gueverra as a man with all convictions and contradictions of any great man.<br />This is a wonderful travel book, filled with history, biography, adventure as well as a dollop of humor. The writing is first rate.  I hope Symmes is working on another book.	2001-12-16

It seems that the physical aspects of this tradition are what we mostly tuned in to in this country. This book, opens the door to a wider spectrum of the yoga experience. I was especially impressed with the amount of research into eastern traditions that went into writing this book. I appreciate all the information this research yielded to the reader. It was well informed, well written and good reading.  It was a very personal book, at times, too personal for my tastes but the impression that remains when the last page is finished is one of satisfaction.  I think this in an important book and will stand the test of time.	2001-02-14

The vistas she conjures up in this book are breathtaking. The hardships she endured are more than most of would care to experience in our travels. Still, it's a great armchair experience!	2001-02-12

It is a most unusual tale of the triumph of the human spirit.  The main character suffers a disfiguring injury which has a profound effect on his life. The steps he takes to re-enter the world are nothing short of amazing.  Read it. You won't forget it.	2001-02-12

Stanley Kirkpatrick is very thorough and we follow Edgar from his earliest days where he plays with \\"fairies\\"  or tiny spirits to his untimely death as he was unable to follow his own advice for healthy living.  It is fascinating life and a well written book.	2001-02-12

As she watches and listens, stories flow by and are woven into the tapestry of life in a German town during the first and second world wars: birth, death, tenderness, brutality, love, betrayl and loss. I found myself marveling at the beauty of the writing in this book.  The story was engrossing and rich and the characters in all their quirks and foibles were fascinating. Maybe it was just me, but the ending seemed to be a bit slowly paced, but that is my only complaint with this wonderful book.	2001-02-12

I think this is my favorite book I've read about South America before and after a trip there.  The author introduces us to the people who live there and are his friends.  We get to see how Tiawanaku looked when it was in use and learn about customs and traditions which live today.  The project to re-introduce ancient agricultural practices of raised beds and irrigation,  was exciting.  We were kept on the edge of our seat waiting to see if a freeze killed the crop and put the population in jeopardy.  A real armchair trip to Bolivia!	2001-01-28

There is nothing extra, nothing fancy, just the spare beauty of the exact right words.  The dilemma Sister John of the Cross faces keeps us turning the pages. As we follow her on her days and into her past, we can't help but like her and her dilemma is ours.  How to decide, when an illness gives you insight into the infinite, whether to let medicine \\"cure\\" you.  This book is a treasure.	2001-01-28
US	49828774	R1ODUXNDMJ38JK	0679759263	127056417	The Soloist	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Satisfying treasure	I read this long enough ago not to remember how I stumbled upon it.  I loved it and went on to read almost everything else Mark Salzman has written and enjoyed it all.  I still remember, when I finished this book just holding it in my hands and turning it over and over not wanting it to have ended. Everything about it is a pleasure, right to the size and picture on the cover.  It's very absorbing on many levels and is one of those books you want to share with friends.	2001-01-28

This is a great story of what happens when grave robbers find something just too good to keep a secret.  The tombs they found were full of untold wealth.  The personalities of the main characters in this tale are as fascinating as the beautiful treasure they unearth.  This reads like fiction but as one other reviewer noted it is all true. I didn't feel the book had a strong finish, but the story itself was irresistable.	2001-01-28

The archeological information about Tiawanaku is fascinating.  The cultural information regarding the Aymara is great too.  But, my favorite part was the project to reintroduce abandoned agricultural practices to the area.  Much larger populations were supported in ancient times due to the micromanagement of climate using irrigation and raised fields.  And it was dramatically demonstrated that it works in this book!  Good reading!	2001-01-26

The photos are stunning and the format is pleasantly small, portable and feels nice in your hands.  It's like a trip around the world and into the soul. Every time I pick this up is like a new visit. I would have enjoyed some text, but I think the photos speak for themselves.  Well worth the price!	2001-01-26

The various doccuments and treasure hunters that the author unearthed and befriended made for a ripping yarn.  His own expedition to the trecherous landscape where the treasure is supposedly hidden was a real adventure.  He cared about the people he wrote about and the reader will too.  Loved this book!	2001-01-26

The idea of chimpanzees who enjoy sitting around drinkng gin and tonic and flipping through magazines seems unbelievable but just helps to illustrate that we are more closely related than seems possible. My only concern was Dr Fouts willingness to trash his bosses. It seemed mean-spirited in the context of this wonderful book.  (not to say some of these people didn't richly deserve to be trashed, but somehow I found it disturbing) It certainly is a wake-up call to researchers and zoos that animals need more compassion, more room, more stimulus, more love and more magazines.  All in all, a great read.	2000-12-13

The cake mix that mom smuggles in has turned to a brick when she wants to prepare it for her daughter's birthday.  I read this book about a year ago and I can still see the place where they lived in my mind's eye.  The garden that failed.  The villagers in the tattered clothing.  Each character had her own distinct and interesting voice. My one criticism would be that the father was a bit of a mystery. Why was he so unbending?  What was his suffering?  Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend this book or run to the library for her next book.	2000-11-22

This book takes the reader on a journey through several cities and archeological sites of Peru. The archeological information is wonderful and there is a large bibliography, glossary of Quechua terms as well as a discography of Andean music. Some of the descriptions will take your breath away with the beauty of the picture he paints and the skillfully crafted writing. This thoughtful book goes beneath the skin and touches the soul of Peru. A must-read before going to Peru!	2000-03-26
