Written in 1969 it covers many new age beliefs.<br /><br />Wish I would have come across this book in the 1970's.  It would have helped me understand my own near-death experience and more importantly would have clearified many of my questions at that time on the \\"why\\" a person has to go through the process of death.<br /><br />This is by far a most affirming look at the next stage of life.  A stage that we continue by the transition of death or in a less negative way \\"crossing over\\".	2005-09-26

Guyon's spiritual writing is well worth the read.  I have read many of the saints and their journeys and I would consider Mme. Guyon to be in their company.<br /><br />Like Saint Teresa of Avila [[ASIN:0140440739 The Life of Saint Teresa of Avila by Herself (Penguin Classics)]], Saint Catherine of Siena [[ASIN:0895557614 The Life of St. Catherine of Siena]] and Saint Terese of Lisieux [[ASIN:B000QRH81Q Autobiography Of A Saint]] one finds the writings of Mme. Guyon to touch on the stages of prayer and contemplation in the same manner.<br /><br />I have found these particular saints and Mme. Guyon to be very familiar especially as the suffering servant.<br /><br />Another comparison would be in the area of spiritual perfection.  These very pious and contemplative women's ultimate goal is union with Jesus.<br /><br />One needs to be careful as not to compare oneself with another's spiritual journey.  We are all on the journey, some will approach in different directions.  Some of us will take one step forward and two steps backwards.<br /><br />It is very diffictult to strive for perfection and one can become addicted to the process.  It is better to let go of one's aspirations and let it be, all will be completed in God's own time.  One cannot rush the process, it will set one backwards if one tries to get ahead, it will create chaos in one's life.<br /><br />It is very difficult to become another's spiritual guide.  There are many spiritual author's who have given us much of their own experience but one has to pray for discernment in choosing the path that one will follow.<br /><br />Jesus is the way and the truth.  All will come to fruition, all will be completed.  The kingdom is here within each and everyone of us.<br /><br />Ascension Thursday May 5, 2005.	2005-05-05

Seraphim Rose.  See my book review.<br /><br />Swedenborg is one of the first writer's to write about dreams and visions and the afterlife.  Dr. Carl Jung [[ASIN:0679723951 Memories, Dreams, Reflections]] was an avid reader of Swedenborg as were, Raplh Waldo Emerson , Elizabeth Browning and Emmanuel Kant.<br /><br />Swedenborg spent the last 27 seven years of his life writing his spiritual journey.  He is honest, articulate and unafraid to befriend the unconscious.<br /><br />I am very grateful that Swendenborg's books have been translated to English, they are gems ready to be discovered.<br /><br />July 1, 2014 more observations. From the editor:  Notes of dreams and visions were not intended for publication by Swedenborg.  Found years later after his death, in a notebook.  Bits and pieces put together in order to be published.  Swedenborg sought to meet God within and this was one avenue that he explored.  Having exhausted all known means of human knowledge, Swedenborg chose to explore within himself in the most direct way possible, by a very close study of the inner process.  An unknown territory that he proposed to risk his life and sanity by exploring.  A daring adventure.  Encountering the Divine within.  Swedenborg's task the inner life was to bring the massive intellect to a feelingful(the feminine side, anima) understanding of life itself. (A heavy load to accomplish). A personal life experience, seeking the truth not intellectually. Understanding.  Affectual.  Living.  Becoming.<br /><br />I will be using SW for Swedenborg & JSH for my own observations.<br /><br />JSH:  One cannot get truth through the intellect by working at it.  One simply \\"knows\\" truth inwardly and it is given freely, it is a gift, it is grace, divine love.  One needs to let go and let God in.<br /><br />SW:  \\"No fragment of a dream is useless\\"<br /><br />JSH:  I have been doing dream journals for over 30 years and dreamwork similar to Swedenborg.  Dreams are personal and speak to you about your life.  Inner life wants to come out and be dealt with.  Dreams are less invasive (sometimes).  Dreams can be gentle or they can shake you up.  Stronger, deeper dreams should take priority, this is where your inner work might start with a dream vision that shakes you up, like Saul on the road to Damascus (St. Paul as we know him in the Bible.  Jesus said to Saul:  \\"Saul why do you persecute me?\\"<br /><br />SW:  It was that I should excuse myself and make myself free.  To find out the fact that one is unworthy and belongs to the work of the Spirit.<br /><br />JSH:  Great humility comes from recognizing that only through the grace of God am I absolved from my sins.  The greater the humility the greater the love for God and humankind.  The greatest Jesus Christ.<br /><br />SW:  Dream 189-  On restraining appetite:  I came into a strange situation and into a kind of chagrin;  but yet I was speedily released after having prayed and sung a psalm.  I will not be any more mine own;  but live as a new man in Christ.<br /><br />JSH:  Other books on dreams and dreamwork have helped me greatly.

The choices have to be made to go forward and grow or stay stagnant.<br />Passive living like watching TV doesn't lead to much inner growth.<br />Reading is mostly intellectualizing.<br />Writing the dream leads to inner development.<br />Go deeper and deeper, keep writing.<br />Message will be revealed.<br />3 is the #.

You will be able to integrate and make choices for the meaning of your life.  These are your dreams, cherish them.  They are not given to others to interpret, they are a reflection of you.<br /><br />JSH:  We dream a third of our life and usually have 8 dreams per night.  Dreams are dramatic presentations of the basic issues of an individual's life.  The feelings inside the dream are always correct.

Finally, I have come across a weight program that makes sense for myself.<br /><br />About 30 years ago I went on a low carbohydrate program and came to my weight goal. Over the years I managed to put it all back on and than some. You ask? Why would I try it again? 30 years ago there wasn't as much understanding on why this diet works but having read Dr. Atkin's book I am a firm believer that most of us are addicted to carbohydrates, I know that I am.<br /><br />My doctor informed me that my glucose count was borderline and she suggested Dr. Atkin's. I was surprised since she is a homeopathic doctor and also an osteopath, I thought wow! I guess I'll have to check into this program another time to make sure this is for me. I did just that and within a month I felt more energy and less sluggish in the afternoon. I have lost weight and I know that I am on the right track, I feel at peace with my decision to make this my lifetime commitment.<br /><br />The food market has changed so much in the last 30 years and there is no reason to feel deprived on this program. You can order low carb foods on the Atkins' web site and I also was able to find a low carb store only 10 minutes from my home. They have bread, bagels, etc. made with soy flour and toasted I can't tell the difference. There is alot of fiber in all of these foods so you get a full feeling. Whereas foods loaded with carbos only make you crave for more. Since I started in Feb. 2003 the supermarkets have greatly improved on the selection of low carb items. Restaurants are also offering better choices.<br /><br />Once you reach \\"ketosis\\" it took me about a week, you start feeling more energy and less cravings, it's like your body has reached a certain satisfaction and you don't think about food as much as before.<br /><br />My two grandmothers had adult onset diabetes and it was no \\"picnic\\" for them. I think I played around enough with foods to start taking it more seriously and pay more attention to what I put in my body.<br /><br />Another book to consider is \\"[[ASIN:0446678678 The Protein Power Lifeplan]]\\" by the Eades.

This leads the way to a healthier lifestyle and the hope that you can still have a normal life.<br />The Eades explain the high protein regiment and it all makes so much sense.

His main focus is the authenticity of most NDE's and the after affects in<br />their lives, specifically Betty Eadie's account of her NDE in \\"[[ASIN:0553565915 Embraced by the Light]].\\"<br /><br />Some pertinent questions are asked by the author and my own responses.<br />1) Why did it take Betty Eadie so many years to tell her story?<br />One must have time to assimilate what has happened and not to react emotionally. This<br />is a very emotional experience as well as intellectual and spiritual. Knowledge comes at<br />a very fast speed, since most NDE's only last about 5 minutes. In 1974 I personally<br />experienced a NDE and after sharing the experience with my family and a few friends I<br />pretty much kept it to myself. In 2000 I put together my own personal website to share it<br />with others, I felt the timing was right.<br /><br />2) What biblical response do the NDE's acquire? Most NDE's experience a great<br />love, an unconditional love that is God's love. If we respond to this love, isn't this what<br />Jesus has asked us to do? Most NDE's change their life's course after their experience.<br />Consider these bible quotations: JN 13:34 I give you a new commandment: love one<br />another. As I have loved you, so you also should love one another. JN 15:10 If you keep<br />my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's<br />commandments and remain in his love. JN 15:13 No one has greater love than this, to<br />lay down one's life for one's friends. JN 17:26 I made known to them your name and I<br />will make it known, that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in them.<br /><br />3) What about near-hell experiences? Although Betty Eadie does not go into detail<br />about her negative experience, she does recount the void and hopelessness that one feels<br />without the love of God. I personally experienced this void at the end of my NDE before<br />coming back into consciousness. One account of the near-hell experience comes from<br />Howard Storm. In his book \\"[[ASIN:0385513763 My Descent Into Death: A Second Chance at Life]] and the Message of Love which<br />Brought me Back\\". This is the story of a near-death, recovery, and transformation - of<br />lessons from spiritual beings about the future, the meaning of life, life after death, the<br />role of angels, and much more. But the Lord of Light sent him back with a message of<br />love. His life was so immensely changed after his near-death experience that he resigned<br />as a professor and devoted his time to attending the United Theological Seminary to<br />become a United Church of Christ Minister. JN 5:24 Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever<br />hears my word and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and will not come to<br />condemnation, but has passed from death to life.<br /><br />I leave you with one of my other book reviews by Carl Jung. \\"[[ASIN:0679723951 Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]\\". These writings come straight from Jung's own inner experience and it is<br />his last book before his death in 1961. I have read and re-read this work because at<br />different times in my life I needed to re-evaluate where I was and where I was going.<br />Other books by Jung are more intellectual and scientific, whereas, this autobiography has<br />the wisdom of a person in the later part of life and it was written not so much to teach but<br />to leave with us his legacy. Having myself had a NDE, I was especially<br />re-affirmed by Jung's own NDE and his dealings with this phenomenon.<br />His acceptance of his own humanity and his returning from this state to share with us his<br/>knowledge and vision is a gift to all of us. It is not easy to return to our humanity and<br />deal with the sufferings we encounter but growth is the only evidence of life. We have to<br />come down from the mountain top and work in the valley.<br /><br />This brings to mind two books<br />written by Hannah Hurnard called \\"[[ASIN:0842346112 Mountains of Spices]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0842314296 Hinds' Feet on High Places]]\\". Allegories about living our lives with others and not in solitude. Solitude is a<br />wonderful place but if we stay too long we become self-centered, afraid to reach out to<br />others.

It gives me great joy to hear of someone who has also encountered Jesus and has gone through the emotional, spiritual and mental journey that this experience made us travel. I wouldn't give up the experience even though it did cause much anxiety to my family and myself.<br /><br />I experienced a near death experience in May of 1974 at the age of 32. Like the author, I was a little fearful to share this experience because nobody that I knew had ever shared this type of experience.<br /><br />In 1975 our family was fortunate to be able to buy a Christian Book Shop and this is where I was able to come across some literature on my experience. Of course the great mystical saints like [[ASIN:081987423X St. Theresa of Avila: God Alone Suffices]], [[ASIN:0935216146 The Collected Works of Saint John of the Cross]]wrote many books on their mystical experiences with Jesus. Discovering Dr. Raymond Moody's book \\"[[ASIN:0062517392 Life After Life: The Investigation of a Phenomenon--Survival of Bodily Death]]\\" was the greatest comfort for me at that time.<br /><br />In reading Return from Tomorrow, what is the most helpful is that with all the turmoil the author experienced he realized that love is the greatest of the gifts and it seems the message is the same in many cases, including my own experience.<br /><br />It is a \\"tall\\" order, it sounds so simple and the message is simple but the \\"ego\\" gets in the way and at times our self-centeredness comes forward. To let go and let God.  At times we are our own worst enemies when it comes to the acceptance of being loved and in return loving others.<br /><br />Like the author, I started reading the bible with a different perspective. Before this \\"re-born\\" experience, I read with only an intellectual, study mind attitude, now I read the bible with my heart open wide.	2003-01-14

There are many gifts of the spirit but the greatest is love.  It sounds so simple, love one another as He first loved us but it is the hardest of all virtues to practice.

This transformation came after much pain, anger, blame and feelings of despair.  The familiar words of Job:  \\" Why me Lord,\\" came to him often and after much scrutiny, Rabbi Kushner is convinced that this is not the God that he believed in, God would not take his son from him, God would not punish in such a cruel way.  God was and is a compassionate and merciful God.<br />This is Rabbi Kushner's gift to us, the conviction, belief and knowledge that God is a loving God.	2001-02-07

I have in the past been on a low carbohydrate diet and yes it did work but I was not ready to incorporate this type of program in my lifestyle. It works for awhile but who could do this for a lifetime. The Heller's add a new twist to it, you have two very low carbohydrate meals a day and one meal in which you can eat pretty much anything you want if you eat it all in one hour. The authors do recommend that you eat healthy at this meal but who ever heard of gorging yourself for one hour, it's not only disgusting, it's not healthy. The scenarios that the clients share are rather funny, for example, going to a party and putting the hor d'euvres in your pocket until the entr&eacute;e is served, and I guess you could wrap up the dessert and take it home.<br /><br />I believe as the author's do that yes, most of us are addicted to carbo's and we need to eliminate a large number of them, mainly the processed foods like chips, crackers, etc. but a moderate amount of fruits and vegetables should be part of every meal.<br /><br />A more holistic approach are the following books: [[ASIN:0553384104 Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing]] by Christiane Northrup, M.D; [[ASIN:0670885932 The Diet Cure: The 8-Step Program to Rebalance Your Body Chemistry and End Food Cravings, Weight Problems, and Mood-Swings--Now]]by Julia Ross and [[ASIN:0804117942 Spontaneous Healing : How to Discover and Embrace Your Body's Natural Ability to Maintain and Heal Itself]]by Andrew Weil, M.D. I have done book reviews on all these and I highly recommend them.	2000-09-26

I still remember how after my biopsy, at the doctor's office, the nurse ushered me into the doctor's  private office, closed the door and sat next to me.  I had come alone and  was not prepared to hear this bad news.  My surgeon had almost assured me  that he would find nothing wrong, since my exams hardly showed any signs of  a tumor.  He proceeded to say \\" I have good news and I have bad news, the  bad news is that you have breast cancer, the good news is that it is at an  early stage and we can treat it with either a lumpectomy or mastectomy,  maybe radiation and possibly chemo but we need to do some more surgery as  soon as possible and remove some lymph nodes to see if it has spread\\".  I  was in for quite a shock when a few weeks later the doctor did a lumpectomy  and also removed 19 lymph nodes and 2 of the lymph nodes were cancerous,  this put me into stage 2 cancer.  I started reading a few books and Dr.  Susan Love's book was the one most suggested by the hospital staff.  One  thing I discovered about this book is not to get to far ahead of things, it  should be read \\"on a need to know basis\\", it is a bit overwhelming to go  through all the stages, statistics, possible recurrences, reconstruction  surgery etc...  One book that I found to be more inspirational is \\"Chicken  Soup for the Surviving Soul:  101 Healing Stories of Courage and  Inspiration.\\"  Also having already read all of Bernie Seigels' books,  I  was familiar with the importance of keeping a balance in my life and living  for the moment.  I was able to see Bernie Siegel, he came to NH and I was  given a ticket by Bishop Leo O'Neil, who I was fortunate to have worked  with in the Diocese of Manchester.  Bishop Leo also had cancer and passed  away in November of 1997.  He was a source of inspiration to all of us in  the Diocese. Five years have passed since my diagnose.  After 3 more  lumpectomies and numerous tests I am cancer free and a breast cancer  survivor.  My chances of recurrence are about 30% according to my  oncologist.  I try to live one day at a time; \\"Yesterday is long gone,  tomorrow is really today.\\"in  the Diocese. Five years have passed since my diagnose.  After 3 more  lumpectomies and numerous tests I am cancer free and a breast cancer  survivor.  My chances of recurrence are about 30% according to my  oncologist.

Catherine had no formal education but yet was able to dialogue with the Pope, Bishops and many of the ecclesiastic members of the Church  through the grace of God.  I will quote from her treatise of prayer:  \\"When  the soul has arrived at the attainment of the general light, of which I  have spoken, she should not remain contented, because, as long as you are  pilgrims in this life, you are capable of growth, and he who does not go  forward, by that very fact, is turning back\\".  Powerful words in the  context of living and growing in our spiritual life.  No matter what stage  we are in our spiritual growth, we can always test ourselves on our  capacity to love and be loved.  Faith, hope and love but the greatest is  love.  Jesus left us a new commandment to love one another as He loves us.	2000-04-29

If we are in touch with our body, mind  and spirit we can be on our way to a better, healthier person.  We have to  take on the responsibilities of our own care, we are the captain of our own  destiny.  At times we do need the medical community because we are  sometimes caught in emergency situations and we need to be discerning in  our choices of care but we should not depend on this treatment.

Upon his death in 1961, his request is to have his diary published if it proves to others to  be worthy of publishing.  This diary is rich with the struggle to live his  life without the benefit of thanksgiving from his peers.  His deep  conviction, which comes after much search and struggle, is to lay down his  life for others, no matter the consequence, the praise, the outcome.  To  live each day by giving up the self and rising above to meet the other on  his/her journey.  Although Dag Hammarskjold did indeed receive much praise  and gratitude as Secretary General for the United Nations, he realized deep  down that this was not the true focus of his life but to give without the  idea of getting anything in return, this is the real self rising, the  spirit of God.  Many have given to us \\"this road less traveled\\" by their  exemplary life:  Jesus, Buddha, Gandhi, Francis of Assisi, Meister Eckhart,  who is quoted in the introduction to Markings:  \\" Only the hand which  erases can write the true thing\\", Simone Weil, Mother Teresa, Dalai Lama  and many other's whose lives are lived in this way but with no recognition.

In sickness unto  death, she never remised from her choice of being where she believed she  could do the most with her life.  One realizes that Simone must have had  something missing in her life to go searching in this manner, to leave her  well ordered, social life behind and go into the depths of humanity.  She  literally allowed herself to be Christ to all she met, to bring God's heart  to His people.  Simone knew the true meaning of love and compassion,  sometimes maybe to extremes.

Death comes to us in small ways everyday.  There are many things in life that we have to die to, inner growth depends on  this.  Dying to small things prepares us for the moment of bodily death.  Our ego for one thing is the hardest to die to, how we love to be right  and not give in to someone else's opinion, how we love to be recognized for  our work, our successes,  our education, our money, our home, cars etc.  To  let go of our ego takes a lifetime but it is well worth the effort and  gives you acceptance and peace of soul.  The practice of letting go in  small things prepares you for the bigger decisions of life.  Your life  becomes less petty and more human, less superficial and more realized, less  important and more compassionate.  It is not an easy lesson but one worth  working through the stages of death and dying.  Victor Frankl in his book  \\"[[ASIN:080701429X Man's Search for Meaning]] \\" also shows us how finite is our existence.  Anthony  DeMello in his book [[ASIN:0764801708 Sadhana, a Way to God: Christian Exercises in Eastern Form]] reveals how important it is to  detach ourselves from desire and also the Dalai Lama lives a life full of compassion although he has been exiled from his own country for over 35  years.

Having  myself played this game of losing and gaining weight since I was 16 in the  late 1950's, I have made a vow to myself not to let society control who I  am.  I will not give up on myself and use everyone else's idea of who I  should be and how I should look.  This book helps but this into perspective  and allows you to choose freely what and who you are becoming.  Most of us,  know what and how to manage our  weight, we've done it so many times.  Julia Ross allows you to think for ourselves and to decide how and when it  will happen. The book also explains how food supplementation and amino  acids taken regularly will help not to have food cravings.  Having been a  firm believer in this approach, our family has been taking supplements  since 1983.  Yes, this does work but some of the cravings are in your head,  your memory plays tricks and you start to want foods that are unhealthy.  Diets don't work period.....If you are not ready to give something up and  try another way, that is your choice and responsibility.  Sometimes one has  to pay a dear price for this freedom but one must have the freedom to  choose one's way.  No one has the right to control or be controlled.  Another book that follows this train of thought is Tao of Eating by Linda  Harper .  You'll be pleasantly surprised to hear that many are on your side  in choosing this non-diet approach to living.

Having been terribly afraid of death  and not believing that I was good enough to receive eternal life, this  experience gave me the answer to the question of life after life.  At that  same moment I was lifted above the couch, saw my non-moving body on the  couch, saw my funeral procession with my children, husband and tried to get  up from the couch and could not until I truly believed that if I let go of  my self-centeredness I would be free.  I immediately remembered that my 2  year old daughter, Lisa was napping and told myself that I needed to come  back to take care of her. I came across Raymond Moody's book and was  relieved to realize that others had had the same experience as I and it  gave me great comfort.

Having lost her first child to kidnapping and murder, it must have been very difficult for her to find a purpose to start over and bear other  children.  One reads between the lines and realizes that only in going deep  within in solitude can one's soul be healed.  One must give herself/himself  time and not rush into busyness, looking  for new relationships, new books  to read, movies to see,  or hiding your emotions, you have to play the  whole thing out or you will perish.  There are many situations we have to  die to, to lose control of, and not  try to possess.  We have to detach  ourselves, not by becoming indifferent but compassionate.  Only then will  we find peace of mind and soul.  Anthony De Mello in his book:  Sadhana:  Way to God [[ASIN:0764801708 Sadhana, a Way to God: Christian Exercises in Eastern Form]] also explores with us the joy that comes from detaching  ourselves from any preconceived endings.  To let go and let others become  who they were meant to become not what we want for them to become.  John S.  Dunne is his book:  Reasons of the Heart:  A Journey into Solitude and Back  Again into the Human Circle [[ASIN:0268016062 The Reasons of the Heart: A Journey into Solitude and Back Again into the Human Circle]] is one of the best books I have read and  re-read on solitude.  I will be giving a copy of Gift from the Sea to my 3  grown daughters for Christmas.  It is my hope that it will give them  support to live out their lives in the grace of the moment.	1999-12-17

To let go of controlling people you live with, work with, play with, to be  and to trust.<br /><br />It is one of the greatest gifts you can give to yourself and  others, it brings peace and fulfillment not to rush and accomplish but to  do one thing at a time, whether it's eating, vacuuming, telephone calling,  working at the office or being with the kids or grandkids.<br /><br />One thing at a  time done with simple awareness is worth doing many, many things without  awareness.  Richard Foster shows us how to live this lifestyle in his books  Freedom of Simplicity and Celebration of Discipline. [[ASIN:0060628391 Celebration of Discipline: The Path to Spiritual Growth]]<br /><br />Once you let go, you  don't have to prove anything to anyone, you lose that competition drive,  status quo, you don't have to live on the edge, you become more  compassionate, more centered, more intuitive, more alive to yourself and  others.<br /><br />You worry less and love more, you fear less and trust more, you  live for the moment, because that's all you have.  You make less mistakes  and better decisions.  You need less and enjoy more.  Live simply so that  others may simply live	1999-12-14

Many oppportunities will open up as we interconnect with others  on a day to day basis.<br /><br />I always try to live by these sayings, do unto others as you would have  others do unto you and, what you reap is what you sow.  To receive love  you must give love.  It is our life's cycle.  At times in our life we are  the doers, the givers, at other times takers, receivers.<br /><br />To be the taker  is not selfish but self actualization.  It requires humility to accept  love, especially when you are not feeling loveable.  In these pages Milton  Mayeroff gives us a philosophy of life in a nutshell.<br /><br />It is a small book  but nevertheless  brings great comfort and peace to the soul.<br /><br />Other  powerful authors are Victor Frankl who wrote Man's Search for Meaning, [[ASIN:080701429X Man's Search for Meaning]] Abraham Maslow, [[ASIN:0140194878 Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences]] and Rabbi Harold  Kushner, When Bad Things Happen to Good People.

I have read and re-read this work because at different times in my life I needed to re-evaluate where I was  and where I was going.<br /><br />Other books by Jung are more intellectual and  scientific, whereas, this autobiography has the wisdom of a person in the  later part of life and it was written not so much to teach but to leave  with us his legacy.<br /><br />Having myself had a near death experience, I was  especially re-affirmed by Jung's own near death experience and his dealings  with this phenomenon.  His acceptance of his own humanity and his returning  from this state to share with us his knowledge and vision is a gift to all  of us.<br /><br />It is not easy to return to our humanity and deal with the  sufferings we encounter but growth is the only evidence of life.  We have  to come down from the mountain top and work in the valley.<br /><br />This brings to  mind two books written by Hannah Hurnard called Mountains of Spices [[ASIN:0842346112 Mountains of Spices]] and  Hinds Feet in High Places [[ASIN:0842314296 Hinds' Feet on High Places]].  Allegories about living our lives with others  and not in solitude.<br /><br />Solitude is a wonderful place but if we stay too long  we become self-centered, afraid to reach out to others.

There are so many obstacles to keep us from fully living our lives.<br /><br />Caroline Myss helps us to evaluate exactly where we are heading, whether in a downward, negative path or a more straight forward peaceful path.<br /><br />Our  emotions  play a big part and will let us know something has gone array.  When we start feeling negative towards ourselves and others, we need to go  inward and ask ourselves what's going on?  Our bodies also react or respond  to the ways we treat it, if we overabuse it, it will get dis ease.<br /><br />Anatomy of the Spirit is a good tool to  help us evaluate ourselves.  By  using the seven stages that she is offering, one is given a head start.  We  do not change ourselves overnight, it takes years and years of going into  the depths of our being, this is an ongoing journey.<br /><br />So it's one step at a  time and sometimes two or three steps backward.  Andrew Weil is another  wonderful and knowledgeable author and his book Spontaneous Healing [[ASIN:0804117942 Spontaneous Healing : How to Discover and Embrace Your Body's Natural Ability to Maintain and Heal Itself]] is well worth the effort in changing some of our destructive tendencies.	1999-12-05

This book is not to be read in one or two sittings. It should be read one chapter at a time, to digest every morsel of her  expertise and knowledge. Keep this one close by, so you can pick it up on  those bleak days.  This book is remarkably low priced to make it  affordable for everyone.  It's the best gift you can give to any woman in  your life.  My three daughters will be getting each one at Christmas along  with a weekend retreat at a lovely place that I found in Maine by the  ocean.  This will be my gift to them, so that they can take some time out  of their very busy lives and get centered on the importance of taking care  of spirit, body and soul.  You can't be for others if you don't take care  of yourself.  You can't give what you don't have, if you push yourself  beyond your limitations you get very negative, burnt out, depressed and  overwhelmed.  It's not easy to stay focused and centered but it is a must,  if we are all going to survive in this sometimes very noisy world.  Christiane Northrup, I salute you for taking the time in your busy life and  giving of yourself in seeing this book published.

After reading Kathleen Norris, \\"The Cloister Walk\\", I was delighted to see the sequel \\"Amazing Grace\\". I am always searching for those persons who are willing to trust and take the risk of sharing their faith with others. It is not easy to go into the depths and find the simplicity of the heart and hope that others can recognize that this simplicity, this place of vulnerability is God communicating with us. You have to leave the cerebral for awhile to get to the heart of Christianity. There is far too much intellectualizing in this day and age. \\"Amazing Grace\\", comes not so much from the head as from \\"listening with the heart\\". I believe, this is where Kathleen Norris is taking us, on her journey. To the depths, sometimes of despair but with faith and trust that this is temporary and we will overcome the temptation to enter into the darkness. We have choices, Christianity is not a place of euphoria. We cannot box God into our way of thinking \\"Give me only your love and your grace, that's enough for me\\".If only I could believe and live these words each and every moment, I would be at peace forever and ever. Amen.	1999-12-04
US	51380802	R6SCIT4O8FP96	0385482639	510051158	A Portrait of Jesus	Books	5	31	32	N	N	A simplistic way of bringing Jesus' presence to our humanity	Joseph Girzone writes this portrait of Jesus with a knowledge of the person of Jesus.  He walks the talk.  Because he knows Jesus personnally, Joseph Girzone can make a difference in his writings.  This is not an  intellectual account of Jesus, it is not fiction, it is a walk with Our  Lord, his friendship with Jesus.  This book does have an historical  slant, you have to read in between the lines to discover Joseph Girzone's  inner life with Jesus.  This inner life is instilled in all of Joseph  Girzones books but his first book Joshua is still my personal favorite.  At  last someone writes about the person of Jesus in an intimate, simple way.  So simple that you have a hard time believing that this is why Jesus came  on earth. Like the famous song from the movie Alfie, Is That All There  Is?.  I have heard the saying the hardest action to take is to see with  the heart and not with the head.  Joseph Girzone has a wonderful way of  writing to make this happen.  He does not force us to believe in his Jesus.  This is not his way, nor is it Jesus' way, he simply and beautifully  brings Jesus alive in his writings.  I have personally read many many books  on  the theology of Jesus but Joseph Girzone's books have taken the log out  of my own eyes and left me with a more open heart to try to live my life  more fully. To walk the path of the Gospel in a more straight forward way.	1999-12-04

I began reading Morton Kelsey's books in 1975 after experiencing a very powerful dream on death and dying.<br /><br />Before exploring my dreams, I was  terrified of dying.  Becoming more aware of my dreams, I realized that God  was communicating to me in a way that was not threatening.  At first I was  a little apprehensive, to give dreams a priority in my spiritual life but I  learned more and more to trust this wonderful gift that God has given me.<br /><br />God has always given me the interpretation of these dreams, it is not  difficult once you learn to communicate with God in this fashion.  Why  would God give you dreams without the interpretations, it does'nt make  sense.<br /><br />I have read many Morton Kelsey [[ASIN:0806625430 GOD, DREAMS, and REVELATION]] and John Sanford [[ASIN:006067055X Dreams: God's Forgotten Language]] books which  introduced me to Carl Jung. [[ASIN:0679723951 Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]  I especially like Jung's biography &#34;  Memories,Dreams and Reflections&#34;.  This book enabled me to understand  many life changes that I experienced in the '70's.<br /><br />I continue to regard my  dreams as the most effective way to communicate with my deeper self.  Dreams have given me many challenges.  They have helped me to overcome  obstacles and they have put me back on the right track when I wander.<br /><br />9-17-15 Reintroducing dreams.<br />Morton Kelsey gives us a Christian approach to our dreams.  He says:  &#34;We are most awake to God when we are asleep to the world&#34;  &#34;If one is convinced that the human being does live bounded by a time-space box, there is no possibility of dealing with the questions of an irrational world.  This is as good as saying that the human being is all-knowing.&#34;  We should not reduce God to our way of thinking.<br /><br />Morton explains that throughout the ages many accounted their experiences of visions and dreams, there is much literature relating these experiences, including the Bible.<br />The Old Testament is full of these experiences.  Abraham-Moses-Jacob-Gideon-Jeremiah-Ezekiel-Mary-Daniel-Samuel-Zechariah-Joel-Job-.<br /><br />In the New Testament:  Paul -Cornelius -Peter-Mary-Joseph-Julius Caesar's wife Calphurnia-Pontius Pilate's wife-Constantine<br /><br />Philosophers:  Plato- Hippocrates-Iraneaus-Origen-Gregory of Nyssa-Basil the Great-Ambrose-Augustine-Jerome-Gregory the Great-St. Anthony-Thomas Aquinas towards the end of his life (Aquinas followed Aristotle philosophy in which one's beliefs are that human beings can experience life only through sensory perception and reason.  There was no place for dreams)<br /><br />It took 3-4 centuries for this view to be totally accepted and several centuries later to re-introduce dreams into the collective conscious, bringing us to Rene Descartes- Emanuel Swedenborg [[ASIN:B009AG41E6 Emanuel Swedenborg's Journal of Dreams and Spiritual Experiences in the Year Seventeen Hundred and Forty-Four (Classic Reprint)]]-<br /><br />Modern times-CG Jung-Freud-Edgar Cayce-Black Elk<br /><br />Once you open the door to dreams and visions you cannot close the door and dreams are the safest way to enter the unconscious but Jesus is the safest way to force out the &#34;demonic&#34;.<br /><br />Revelation has it's deepest meaning in the last dream of the night or early morning.  Dreams are collections of vivid series of images over which we have no control.  Upon awakening jot down any symbols that you have received in the dream, this will help you to remember more details and enable you to move forward, write in your journal and do dream work.  After the dream the work begins.  One mustn't just push the dream aside, you had the dream for a reason.  Look into it and if you neglect them, you are actually neglecting a very important part of your spiritual journey.<br /><br />Don't judge a dream. a very subtle dream is just as important as a &#34;peak experience&#34; dream.  You need to deal with the small details in your dreams just like in your every day life.<br /><br />The dreams seldom reveals more than we are able to take in.  A dream almost always encourages interpersonal relationships and points out unloving and selfish attitudes.<br /><br />Whatever one dreams does not determine the future; rather it only shows the possibilities of what may occur.  The dream has to be lived out before it becomes real. It thus gives one the choice of doing something in order to change the message that the dream brought.<br />To allow oneself to be influenced by a dream(s) does not mean to give oneself over to fatalism but possibilities and sometimes a warning to change.<br />Molded by the Spirit, dreams help us to develop towards wholeness, bringing together all parts of a person.
