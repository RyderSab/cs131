It's a good thing I was a business development manager and project administrator for a dot com before reading this book, otherwise I would not have gotten very much out of it.  This is mainly because it is just not geared toward the majority of eBay members and store members. It really is meant for those whose goal it is to be Power Sellers on eBay and at the top of their category.<br /><br />This book has a very definite corporate feel to it with lots of bar graphs and charts and figures and strategies. If you want to kick all the competition out of your way, then this is the book for you. If you  have more modest goals, it still is a good read, but it could have been done better.<br /><br />The Five P's for having a successful business on eBay: Product, Placement, Performance, Price and Promotion definitely are worth remembering. Otherwise, the number crunching and acronyms are a definite distraction to what might have been a decent eBay book.	2005-06-04

While she is correct in some of her conclusions of the similarities of the Egyptian Goddess, Sekhmet and the Hindu goddess Durga, she really lost me on some of what she was saying. Sekhmet does not suck souls, and She is not a goddess that  has \\"....an insidious evil lurking behind her eyes\\".  If that were the case, then why include Sekhmet at all?<br /><br />The Egyptian section of this book is very superficial and very wrong from an historical and magickal point of view. Please take it with a very large grain of salt.	2005-05-07

Within her herbal apprentice program, this book is required reading, and it is a very good thing that it is. Matthew Wood discusses not only the medicinal values of the herbs but the energetics, almost to the point of the magical.<br /><br />For those of us who consider not only our physical relationships to the herbs, but also the metaphysical ones, this book is invaluable. It is very affirming that when we work closely with nature and the energies of the herbs and herbal medicine, we all are much better off. This is a work that empowers the reader and gives them a very deep knowledge of the herbs discussed. It has the highest recommendation I can give it and should be rated even higher.	2004-09-23

I was an abused wife, and for a woman who lives in an abusive marriage, her life can more or less become \\"hell\\".  Alot of times women put up with the situation because they do not know what their choices are, they do not know how to ask for help, or where to go to find answers. The author has laid it out in concrete ways to get women to think along the lines of their own safety and security.<br /><br />This book is one that I have read and used and have bought countless times for other women who were desperately in need of getting free of a very bad marriage.  I will continue to give this book to friends and family because I do believe that it is the finest I have read.	2004-08-26

This was the first book that introduced me to the works of Pauline Gedge back when I was a freshman in college in 1980. I have read absolutely everything that Pauline Gedge has written since, and it is all nothing less than incredible.  I have also read anything and everything that I could get my hands on that was fiction set in ancient Egypt. Everything else pales by comparison.  Gedge, far and away has done impeccable research and has painted the most realistic picture of Ancient Egypt in print.  No one writing fiction set in this period before or since can match the lush, gilded with gold and intense colour that one finds in her books.  &quot;Child of the Morning&quot;, which is about Hatshepsut, is a great read, and a wonderful first novel that established her as a writer.

It really wasn't what I expected at all. Later books that Goldberg wrote after this one, such as Wild Life, were much better.  One good bit of advice was actually doing your daily pages with a 'fast' pen, such as a fountain pen. I have to admit, that did help me quite a bit, if only just to assist with easing carpal tunnel! Although where she was getting fountain pens for a mere [price] is a mystery to me!  The adage to just keep writing is about as useful as it gets in this book.	2002-05-02

John Randolph Price has put together a nice little tome that really draws, from what I can see, about six or seven of his previous works.  It is a nice synopsis book, but if you are like me, and have read and enjoyed Price's work over the years, you realize that he has said it all before and with a little more detail than you can find in this small volume.<br /><br />However, I will say that in re-reading the volume years later, I found much more about it that I was ready to hear. The principles are sound and while you may find bits and pieces in his other works, this one applies it to the idea of inner and outer alchemy.	2002-03-18

I can't wait to get my hands on the other two volumes as soon as they become available - however I have been waiting for almost a year for the promised second and third volumes of the book.

Her characters and scenes are equisitely detailed, whether she writes in the third or first person.  House of Illusions continues the story of Thu, and her son, who were separated under edict of Rameses III.  The ending and events, although near the end were rather fantastical and almost predictable.

Dr. Muata Ashby, who gave us such titles as &quot;Egyptian Yoga&quot; has actually done pretty well in attempting to put out a book about the Ancient Egyptian (Kemetic) view of health and healing.  There are a few things which I find to rather sloppy scholarship.  It would be nice, if after all this time, he would cite the authors and actual passages of his &quot;Ancient Egyptian Proverbs&quot; that he quotes throughout the book.  Also the picture of the &quot;Imhotep Pharmacy&quot; at the temple of Aset (Isis) at Philae on page 28 is a bit over the top.  His intentions, however are good, and most anyone can get something from the book as it outlines good eating and living habits.  This however, is certainly not the end all be all when studying health and medicine of Ancient Egypt.	2002-03-18

Bruno Bettelheim's book is excellent in looking at the psychology behind fairy tales.  I think what most modern readers forget is that the Fairy Tales were moral tales, and that we cannot really look at them with modern eyes.  In the earlier eras, Children were viewed as &quot;miniature adults&quot; that had to be shown the ropes of what was considered the modes of good and acceptable behavior in society.  I read this book after the release of the film &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; which took Little Red Riding Hood and put it into a tale of adolecence and budding sensuality against what is considered staying on the straight and narrow path.  The effect was pure Bettelhiem.  I would definitely recommend this book to give a new perspective on fairy tales and their importance in the collective consciousness of our world.	2001-02-18

He clearly  shows that the governing bodies of modern general or &quot;accepted&quot;  medicine have a vested interest in supressing these treatments and making  sure that most average folks never know about them.

Having written for several online communities where Ancient Egypt is one of the time periods, this book has proven to be invalauable. The biggest problem for people there is finding good, authentic character names for themselves and their storylines. Ms. Durr's book, though intended as a resource for breeders and owners of Pharaoh Hounds, has been invaluable to me and other writers on the respective websites.  It has given people a great place to start with very good suggestions as to what to name their characters.<br /><br />The book is filled with thousands of names of Pharaohs, Queens, god-names, Egyptian symbols, sacred animals, Nomes and Districts in Ancient Egypt and different Ancient Egyptian words and phrases that are translated into the English.  The lists are broken down to masculine and feminine names to help cut down on confusion.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to other writers  and they have commented that it is very helpful. If you are also an animal lover and have a dog or cat that you want to give a powerful and \\"different\\" name coming from Ancient Egypt, this is an excellent resource.	2000-02-26

(The Royal Diaries)	Books	1	11	22	N	N	Gregory Knows Absolutely Nothing About Her Subject	I bought this book thinking it would be a good little diversion.  I grew up with Scholastic books and expected a nice story. What I read I was horrified at.<br />Kristiana Gregory has not only butchered the character of  one of the greatest figures in history but has completely disregarded the  religious beliefs of the Ancient Egyptians and the Ptolemies.A glaring  example of this would be on page 55 where Cleopatra is recounting how her  father compared her to Nefertiti and how she:<br />&quot;admired this queen wh  lived more than a thousand yeasrs ago. During my many hours in the Library,  I have studied her greatness and that of her husband Akhenaton.  Their  religion was based on worshiping one god only, the Spirit of Truth. Some  Egyptians hated them so much for this, they destroyed momnuments and erased  their royal names from many of the records.  I am honored that Father  thinks I resemble Nefertiti in character.  She stood strong for what she  believed and did not worry about what others thought of her.&quot;<br />By the  Ptolemaic period Amarna had long since been completely razed to the ground.  Cleopatra VII would not have even been remotely aware of the name of or  perhaps even the existence of Nefertiti or Akhenaten. I fact *no one* would  until many centuries later! Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten) would not have been  admired in Cleopatra's day, nor would his heretical religious sentiment.  *IF* Cleopatra VII would have ever referred to either character it would be  completely without with any sort of admiration. By this time that  particular ruler had been long since simply referred to as &quot;The  Criminal&quot;.<br />Cleopatra VII often referred to herself as &quot;The  Living Isis&quot; and her devotion to that deity was from very early in her  reign. Such admiration of monotheistic viewpoints would not only have been  out of character, but an anathema to who Cleopatra VII was and what she  believed in.<br />Ms. Gregory needs to understand that this is an historical  figure she is writing about, not a character she herself has made up and  gets to put words in their mouth.  Nor is this rewriting of Cleopatra VII's  character something she should undertake lightly thinking that her  remanipulation of historical facts  and cultural sentiments will impress  her local vicar.  In short, she needs to turn off the Cecil B. DeMille on  the video, pick up a book on history and give it the proper attention to  detail with accuracy that Cleopatra has earned, and in fact,very rightfully  deserves.<br />In the &quot;historical&quot; appendix in the back of the book:  I was very dismayed that the author cannot tell the difference between  &quot;Isis&quot; (Aset in Egyptian)who is always shown depicted with either  a throne on her head, or solar disk and horns as a woman or a cow headed  woman,  and then confusing this Deity with the Goddess Sekhmet, who has the  Solar Disk of Ra with Uraeus and the head of a Lioness. How she could have  confused the two is a complete mystery.<br />My recommendation is that if you  or your child is truly interested in Cleopatra VII to read something that  is quite a bit more adequately researched and based in history rather than  this particular book.  Even if it is fiction for children, it is  exceedingly *bad* children's fiction.<br />I would  recommend:<br />&quot;Cleopatra&quot; By Hornblow (I believe long since out of  print: but some libraries still have it in the young adults section - you  can also find it on online auctions from time to  time.)<br />&quot;Cleopatra&quot; By Michael Grant<br /> and for *acurate*  information on the religion of the Ancient Egyptians:<br />&quot;Conceptions  of God in Ancient Egypt: The One and the Many&quot; by Erik  Hornung<br />&quot;The Neteru of Kemet&quot; By Tamara Siuda<br />&quot;Daily  Life of Egyptian Gods&quot; By Meeks and Favard-Meeksis an historical  figure she is writing about, not a character she herself has made up and  gets to put words in their mouth.

Judith Tarr should be placed under arrest, tried and convicted for the first-degree murder of an historical figure via a fictional account of that person's life!<br />Judith Tarr's portrayal of the legendary Cleopatra VII was at the very least a mockery of the very life she sought to do honour through fiction.<br />Ms. Tarr seems hung up on the &quot;ugly-Cleopatra&quot; idea probably because she has not seen any portraits of Cleopatra VII other than on coins.  Admittedly, the minted portraits of Cleopatra VII are horrendous, but by all other historical accounts of Cleopatra's time, she was not an ugly woman - the statuary and inscriptions bear witness to this as well.  If Tarr had truly done more thorough research, for example outside of her own public library or a quick Netsearch -  one can only surmise she would have seen fit to write this book better than she did....if not out of the sheer guilt of honoring the memory of probably History's most powerful awe inspiring women of all time.<br />I can only say that the only worse book on Cleopatra that I have ever read outside of this one is called &quot;That Egyptian Woman!&quot; written during the fifties. (I cant even remember the author it was so bad!) A book with the description and dialogue that sounded like it came right off the set of &quot;I Married Joan.&quot;<br />I wouldnt recommend Judith Tarr's book even as doorstop.  Tarr, like a literary Lizzie Borden has performed a nightmarish hatchet job on the Queen of the Nile.	1998-07-06

Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed in her treatment of Cleopatra. As a character, her actions were predictable and almost devoid of any sort of feeling or emotion.  I found myself comparing this work with William Bostock's &quot;I Cleopatra&quot;, and for all its faults, Bostock's work far exceeded George's in terms of characterizations, flow, and historical accuracy.  Im sorry, I would like to rate this work higher, but in all good conscience cannot.	1998-02-20
