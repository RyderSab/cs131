This is a great history of Saturday Night Live, told in oral form: with quotes from the participants themselves. It is a meaty volume and covers the entire history in detail -- from the 1970's the the present. Like any provocative story, it raises more questions than it answers: Why did someone as talented as Larraine Newman not make it big after the show? How did such good comedy come out of such a competitive atmosphere where people were constantly pitted against each other? <br /> <br />The main drawback is that the authors don't let the oral portions of the story speak for themselves. There are too many distracting inserts where the authors attempt to summarize events, which usually can be gleaned already from the quotes. Worse yet are little philisophical pontifications attempting to encapsule these events. We readers can supply this for ourselves, since we have been given the information from the participants. These sections might be acceptable if the added passages were only at the beginnings of the chapters, but they are inserted throughout the book and add little to the content. Legs McNeil's \\"Please kill me: the uncensored oral history of punk,\\" available elsewhere on Amazon.com, does a much better job with this approach.	2005-09-28

There is much of interest here for the reader, especially readers with dogs. Like many of us, Mr. Katz is several generations removed from working directly with the land. The issues he deals with as an educated urban white man, embarking on a rural lifestyle surrounded by conservative, no-nonsense countryfolk -- will strike a chord for many of us.    He is at his best when telling simple, engaging stories about the deeds of his dogs and animals -- losing a sheep twin during birth, giving up his sullen dog Homer to a happier home in the city, and his untested puppy's amazing emergency rescue of a sheep flock lost in the woods at night.    What detracts from all of it is constant over-analysis of events and feelings, which are reiterated in the reader's ear like a dripping faucet. A writing teacher once said to our class: \\"nothing you can tell me about what you are feeling can come close to what I can feel myself if you let me.\\" Mr. Katz doesn't share this philosophy; there are too many passages about wondering what his sister is feeling, wondering how he will feel about something; too many attempts to tie up his ponderings into little philosphical packages that will make sense to him at middle age. These are all feelings that we can supply for ourselves -- if he would let us -- because we are humans with feelings too. Afer a time, I found myself bleeping over whole paragraphs of these cerebral meanderings to get to the relevant parts of the story.    Even so, I would buy another book by this author. The basic material is very powerful, but the book is frustrating because it all could be SO MUCH BETTER with a nuanced approach to the writing.	2005-09-28

Obscure to us today in the 21th century, the mystery of the Mary Celeste had the appeal then that UFOs and Kennedy assassination conspiracies have for some today. <br /> <br />Author Hicks is to be congratulated for conducting mountainous research on this facsinating story, yet making it all accessible and readable. While perhaps not as engaging as a detective novel, it nonetheless was hard for me to put down.  <br /> <br />In the end, Hicks' elegantly simple expanation for the mystery ties up all the loose ends that the crackpot consipracy theories couldn't explain. Well-written, enjoable, and highly recommended.	2005-06-10

Books	4	13	13	N	N	Good background, context for the uninitiated reader	As someone who was always perplexed as to how a World War could start over the assassination of an Archduke, I found this book to be informative, well-researched, and enjoyable to read.  <br /> <br />The author fills in the details about important events preceding the war -- the struggle for world dominance among the European powers, and Germany's paranoia. His overiding thesis is that it was really all about TWO wars -- Austria-Hungary wanted a war with Serbia, and Germany wanted a war with Russia. Germany badgered Austria into punishing Serbia for the Duke's assassination, and the rest is history. <br /> <br />Glancing briefly at the other reviews here, I gather not everyone agrees that this is a useful book. But as someone without a lot of background on the topic, I found this a well-written, captivating treatment about the context and events resulting in World War I.	2005-05-22

There are dozens of patterns, oscillators, and indicators; at first each one seems like it's going to be great, but after a few losing trades, a person gets confused about how to proceed and just what indicators to use.     The great thing about this book is the emphasis on STRATEGIES -- this approach places indicators and oscillators in their proper role as tools that are subservient to strategy. As a beginning technical trader faced with a bewildering minefield of tools, it wasn't until I started using these strategies that I started making some money in the uncertain market we are currently in.    The book does seem somewhat thin -- the text and figures are LARGE, as if trying to take up more space. There could have been a bit more background and info provided, I suppose. I also don't understand why the man won't use candlesticks, which I find much more intuitive than bars. But in the main I've found it very helpful.	2005-03-02

If you want the detailed political context about the Rising and why it failed, this is a valuable book.    The author's interest in this book is not the Rising itself, but the political machinations behind it -- the exiled Polish government, the brutally underhanded and opaque Soviets, the detached U.S., and Churchill's ethically correct but ultimately failed good intentions.    We learn the details of the Rising itself only obliquely, as the author focuses on the interactions among the Allies. We glean this color and information about the Rising mostly through sidebars sprinkled throughout the book written first-hand by participants of the Rising. These sidebars are the part of the story in which many of us might be most interested, but as presented here, they're almost a distraction. The author does become more engaged with the human drama when presenting the aftermath of the Rising, the surrender of the Home Army, and the exodus of the civilian inhabitants.    I too was frustrated at the naming, and coventions like calling Poland \\"The First Ally\\" in the first chapters -- I kept looking back through the text in futility to see exactly who \\"The First Ally\\" was, as well as to straighten out a bewlidering array of persons and acronyms.    The author should be given credit for providing an objective overview about the politics; he is clear about the conclusions the historical doumentation supports, and what conclusions history doesn't support. I wasn't satisfied with his treatment over the controversy about gentile Varsovian's abandonment of the Ghetto Jews; I don't know the facts one way or the other, but he seemed to dismiss it all a little too easily.     Personally, this wasn't the book I was looking for, but it was a book that needed to be written and I'm guessing it is very important historically. Given these disappointments, I still found myself compelled to finish it.	2005-03-02

This book nicely distills that information into strategies, reiterates certain key themes, and makes concrete recommendations -- about when to buy & sell and when not to. I have found it to be very helpful.  <br /> <br />As a beginner, it doesn't hurt to be reminded of tested approaches over and over. And where the more technical authors like John Murphy barely pay lip service to the psychological underpinnings of technical analysis, Turner makes it front and center. I appreciated this; it helps me to really understand my behavior and the behavior of others as I look at a chart. <br /> <br />Like another reviewer on this page, I too could have done without  the cosmic meanderings at the end of each chapter. But basically I've found the book very useful, and I'll keep using it until I'm ready to move on to the next level.	2005-03-02

Like a dictionary, it's something you should keep handy in your office. <br /> <br />For beginners, however, there is a lot of information that will be hard to distill. You'll be introduced to a bewildering array of patterns, oscillators, and indicators, and be faced with a confusing complexity of choices about when to use what. There isn't a lot about strategy; he introduces the tools, and leaves the rest up to you. What the book book contains about the psychological underpinnings of technical analysis is intriguing, but there ain't much -- just a couple of paragraphs! <br /> <br />Again: this book's value is as a REFERENCE. Don't base your strategies on it necessarily, but use it to supplement books by people like Dave Landry or Toni Turner. But for any trader John Murphy's book is a must-have; no question about it.	2005-03-02

Because of the Ramones close involvement, it predictably skirts some sticky issues -- like Joey losing his girlfriend to Johnny and Dee Dee's teenage hustling -- but tackles others head-on, like Dee Dee's substance abuse. It does come off as fannish; there are a lot of sentences that end with exclamation marks!  <br /> <br />While not as great as the other documents of the 70's New York punk scene -- Heylin's \\"From the Velvets to the Voidoids\\" or Kozak's \\"This ain't no disco\\" or especially McNeil's \\"Please kill me\\" -- this does have a lot of information about the Ramones that is missing from the aforementioned books.

But the 1-star reviews here seem overly harsh to me. This book is certainly more objective and less unflinching than Bessman's very fannish book.<br /><br />One thing I took home from this that I've missed from other sources was Dee Dee's pervasive influence on the band's songwriting and the essential complexity of this apparently simple person. Take this quote from Roberta Bayley:<br /><br />\\"Dee Dee was very creative and very unhappy but he was like a child in his desire to please and his desire to shock...\\"<br /><br />Indeed.<br /><br />I haven't yet read Melnick's book, but for a book devoted entirely to the Ramones, I would recommend this book over Bessman's anytime. Neither is as good as McNeil's \\"Please kill me,\\" although that book covers a lot more than just the Ramones.	2005-01-16

In the late 1990's and early 2000's, movie critic David Denby went through a painful divorce and lost his accumulated savings -- to the tune of $900,000 -- in the 2000-2001 tech crash. This book chronicles his personal fall and his flirtations with the \\"big boy\\" investment gurus.    Denby should be congratulated for sparing no one, least of all himself (note the book's title), from guilt in the burst of the early 2000's tech bubble.     After awhile, though, it all starts to gets old. He ruminates endlessly about greed, guilt, his idolation of and identification with the power-brokers and big-time investment wizards. The main take-home points are driven home early-on, but he torturously runs it down our throats over and over, as he takes us through the fall of the market and his personal downward spiral with it. By the end of the book, Denby is literally in tears after seeing one of his tech heros led away in chains after the ImClone insider trading scandal. Although clearly in a disfunctional state due to depression, it's hard for us to have much sympathy for Denby at this point; most of us would say: \\"Come on, wake up, you self-indulgent idiot!     Ultimately, the moral of this cautionary tale for Denby is that family and writing are the things that always were important, and remain the important things.    In some ways, to complain about this book is to complain about Denby himself, for he exposes his entire soul here -- what you see is what there is. And he writes really well. But as soul-searching and intimate as this is, the endless guilt and meaderings on himself, greed, and human nature are just too much and too self-immolating. Even though much of what he endures might apply to any of us, at some point most readers are just going to say: \\"Enough already.\\"	2004-12-06

In this book, he gathers a series of oral statements from divorcees, as well as from experts -- divorce lawyers, a divorce judge, a psychologist, a sociologist. His book is a portrait of modern divorce in our country through the eyes of its pained subjects, but on a deeper level is driven and informed by Feifer's personal search to understand his own experience - at least that's my sense of it. To me, this gives the book a force and trajectory missing from the more academic but also excellent book \\"Uncoupling,\\" also about the divorce experience.    People who have gone through, or are considering, divorce or separation will find a lot here to which they can relate. All types are represented here, from wealthy to working class, ranging from people who were abusive or abused, to people who were sympathetic and understanding of their ex-spouse's pain to the point of tragedy, even while they made hard decisions about their personal futures. A recurrent theme in a majority of the cases is that people had a nagging feeling that something, somewhere, about the relationship wasn't quite right BEFORE they embarked on marriage.    Anyone going through this painful process will find people or stories here, or parts of stories, with which they can identify.	2004-11-24

In her search for pie, the author encounters interesting characters and snapshots of America and Americana.    A downside is that the author's engagement is somewhat... superficial. By her own admission, her choosing of pie as the theme for her roadtrip is arbitrary. As a journalist always looking for a story, she is constantly on the lookout for certain tidbits, soundbites, and events of interest, and this renders a certain self-consciouness to the proceedings.     For example: In Memphis, an old man mentions a pie stop that local people go to after church: \\"I was glad he brought church up,\\" the writer says, \\"because Kris and I had a hankering for some live, soul-searing spirituals.\\" She goes on to describe their morning adventure as two 30-something white yuppie women in an all-black southern church. How phony, opportunistic, whitebread and contrived can you get? That, and a few too many predictable self-deprecatory \\"to hell with our waistlines -- we're eating more pie\\" jokes of the \\"Cathy\\" comicstrip sensibility -- wears thin after awhile.     Some of those aspects may be pet peeves on my part. But a very real problem with the book is a significant loss of momentum between sections (between her first and second pie trips) that makes it read almost like two different books.    All that said, this is a fun and entertaining book. It will make you excited about pie, and for cooks there are probably some great recipes. Despite some superficiality, there are some compassionate and interesting portraits of the people they encounter. And in the end, the author digs a bit deeper into herself, and finally connects with her subject matter. I found the concluding two pages to be moving and memorable.	2004-11-09

On the way you will learn some facts about pizza -- for instance, that it was not invented in Chicago after WWII (as I thought), and that it has ancient and modern Italian associations. And as you share the author's journey, you will think about the emotional attachments to your own past food experiences, and think about how those experiences may bias your taste and thoughts about what good food is.    I did sense just the teeniest bit of... how to say it... elitism? inherent in the author's perspective on his quest for pizza. The world the reader joins is not one of working class food, but of high cuisine, with the attitudes and and the social connections that go with it. There may be just a bit of flaunting of this sensibility throughout. I'm not quite sure that I've sorted out whether this is real or imagined on my part, or if there is any way for the author to have avoided it given his background; but the book is still great and very enjoyable.	2004-08-18

Budding nonfiction writers often don't think about the AUDIENCE for their book and thus have a hard time selling proposals;  2. Budding nonfiction writers need to work more on TELLING A STORY -- developing narrative & pacing to make readers want to finish a nonfiction book.  3. Nonfiction writers undermine their own credibility if they don't tell a BALANCED STORY and show the other side of their thesis.    Yes, there may be some weaknesses in the writing, etc., but I frankly am baffled by the anger informing some of the reviews here. This is a help book for beginning nonfiction writers, not a successor to the works of Hemmingway.    I defy anyone to read the Appendix's sample proposal on Henry Beecher and not want to go out and buy that book. That's what it's all about; writing a proposal that makes your agent or editor want to push for your book.	2004-07-28

Like other retail foods such as soda pop and salty snacks, the candy business has undergone profound corporate consolidation in the past 50-100 years, with the hundreds of regional producers that made it interesting now gone. This book is about Steve Almond's first-hand, personal journey into into the world of regional candy. In the process he delves into his own relationship with candy, exploring what it is about candy that resonates with him.<br />If you're looking for a comprehensive food history like Zuckerman's &quot;The Potato,&quot; Coe's &quot;History of Chocolate,&quot; or Pendergrast's coffee book, you'll be disappointed, as Almond would be the first to admit. But if you're looking for looking for an extremely entertaining first-person read, you'll find this to be a sugar-high that is hard to put down. And despite  shortcomings that the negative reviewers here on Amazon.com have mentioned, you WILL learn a lot about the fascinating and colorful candy industry -- and what we've lost culturally in our striving to keep stockholders happy with never-ending corporate growth.<br />Almond's humor, enthusiasm, and the lessons he learns about himself on this journey are what makes this book so fabulous. Amazon reviewers who castigate him for being too introspective miss the point that this is a personal story! and may not be familiar or comfortable with this approach -- or must be easily offened by his frankness.<br />That said, the tendency to be flippant toward his subjects makes me uncomfortable; a lot of his humor comes at someone else's expense. After seeing how some of the interviewees come off in the book, I would not want to be interviewed by Almond. But drug use or the occasional four-letter word? Hey, it's a semi-autobiographical book for adults! C'mon, folks.	2004-06-14

I found this book to be invaluable. By following the suggestions in this book I was able to submit a proposal that was instantly snapped up by a New York literary agency.<br />Perkins makes a good case for agents occupying the nuturing role to writers that editors formerly fulfilled before corporate conglomeration in the 1980's bulldozed the publishing landscape. With few exceptions agents are now an absolute necessity for authors publishing a commercial book (perhaps this is not so with University presses). In addition, agents will make sure you get paid as much as possible (because their commission is based on your payment) and can obtain foreign royalties for your book, something most of us would be hard-pressed to go about procuring on our own.<br />I can accept that someone might not like this book, but I'm perplexed by the angry tone of some of the reviewers who gave this a 1- or 2-star rating; it's almost as if Perkins had personally turned down one of their own proposals. Yes, the single query letter example she uses is pretty skimpy, but that's been covered extensively in other sources; hey, just look at Writer's Market if you need more query letter examples. The sections explaining the various parts of the proposal are helpful, informative and great.<br />She will tell you what to expect from your agent, and what not to expect. She colors it throughout with anecdotes that make it personal and readable. You'll find out what the agent's world -- daily lunch meetings with editors and authors, etc. -- is like. The book will answer all the countless questions you might have about where, when, and what to expect on the road to getting published. For example: when you finally meet your editor or your agent over lunch, who pays the restaurant bill? To find out, read this book.	2004-06-11

There may be biases or omissions of which I am not aware, but there was enough to give me a broad background on the uprising and its context -- and to keep me riveted on the struggle.<br />One disappointment was the production values of the 1993 Da Capo Press edition, which is a republication of Putnam's 1976 edition. From the look of the type and photos, it appears they may have actually shot the plates for the present edition from a printed copy of the original edition! -- the photos especially are of unforgivably poor quality. <br />But this doesn't detract from the tale of the uprising, which is told with compassion, and absorbed me totally for the better part of the 2 days it took to finish.	2004-03-28

The most interesting parts of the book are the beginning in which he describes Soho's slow transformation from a daytime industrial district into the thriving artist colony it was to become. I lived in lower Manhattan for much of the same period and can recall many of the people and places he describes.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that there is no story, no narrative trajectory, no structure. The chapters appear to be loosley based on certain themes, although even those are hard to discern at times. There's nothing chronological; it's just a rambling collection of reminiscences with no cohesion or thread to hold it together or make it engaging. The author's nostalgic point of view (criticized in the Publisher's Weekly review above) would be fine if he stayed with it and honed in on it; but as is, it's just an uneven mish-mash of nostalgia and memories weaving in and out of splatterings of facts, with no order or trajectory. I have to honestly say I only got halfway through this book, so it may have improved by the end. But it just wasn't worth it for me to force myself through what felt like literary packing peanuts when there's so much other good stuff out there to read.<br /><br />It needn't be this way. For example, Legs McNeil authored an excellent history of punk rock taking place mostly in New York at about the same time as this book (see \\"Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk\\" elsewhere on Amazon.com). The latter shows that a recent period of New York history can be conveyed in oral remembrances in a way that both informs and captivates the reader. Such an approach would have taken more labor and forethought -- something that is sorely lacking in this volume.	2004-03-02

In many ways, his warmth and understanding were predecessor to what Mr. Rogers brought to children's TV -- although an essential difference is that Mr. Roger's entire agenda was about supporting children, whereas Barnaby hosted a show that marketed cartoons to children, and was supported by advertising...     Anyway, I find myself perplexed at the 5-star reviews of this book. Sheldon has collected and strung together a bunch of anecdotes about his life on-the-way, during, and after showbiz. What grabbed his attention and what he seems to find worth writing about are the high points in life. So there are anecdotes are about times of triumph, like performing or hanging out with Bob Hope or Robert Mitchum or Emmet Kelly; or times of despair like being ripped off as a child during the Great Depression, lost loves, or dealing later with sickness and alcoholism. For me the truest and most vivid parts of the book were of his vagabond childhood in the 20's and 30's, including a couple of absolutely heartbreaking stories; and of regional showbiz in the 40's. Parts of these sections paint colorful pictures, and we can identify with his feelings and experiences.     Later this is lost, especially when it comes to Barnaby. There's very little there about Barnaby and what made the character alive, and more importantly what makes Sheldon tick. We're told about his battle with alcoholism and how Barnaby kept him going, but the level of engagement is somehow superficial; Sheldon keeps himself, and therefore engages us, at a distance. After some basic info about how the show started, he goes back again into the anecdotes; a story about Jeanne Dixon, a story about a run-in with a park maintenance worker while in costume...there's surprisingly  little meat about the Barnaby Show itself, its development and growth, and little of him or his involvement in it. Indeed, Woodrow theWoodsman, his sidekick, is mentioned only in the photo captions, and not at all in the text!    Maybe it was all lost to him in a blur, and maybe I shouldn't expect so much from someone who is not a writer to begin with, but I think there could have been a lot more here. Perhaps he needed to distance himself from what he went through in order to write about it at all. But given what he has been through, there is enough pain, tragedy, triumph, humor, and history to be of universal interest; whereas all we have now is a minor book of nostalgic interest to those who grew up in Cleveland, with very little in the way of detail.	2003-12-28

If you grew up in the greater Cleveland area in the '50s or '60s you will love this book. <br />It would be great to see a larger-scale, more detailed book about the business of Higbee's. I suppose that because Higbee's was a well-run and above-board business that such a book might lack the intrigue and controversy needed for a compelling story. Still, the book left me wanting much more!	2003-09-25

I grew up with Melungeon classmates in southeastern OH and picked this up out of curiosity. What a fascinating story! The subtitle is perhaps a little misleading. I almost avoided the book because it sounded like a diatribe about ethnic massacres; whereas it is really a geneaological journey that weaves in the Melungeon experience in America. At first it comes off as an esoteric delving into the author's geneaology; but as the story unfolds, the reader becomes sucked into the fascinating story of Kennedy's family and their colorful Melungeon roots. <BR>A downside is that he is quick to take scientists to task for their hesitancy about alternative views on Melungeon origins. He seems not to be aware that researchers, in ANY scientific field, need to exercise caution and cannot advocate new hypotheses without data. Meanwhile, he exercises no such caution about his ideas -- speculation on everything from lost colonies, to some really far-fetched word origins -- runs rampant. If not for this I'd give it 5 stars. That being said, this is a fun and fascinating book, and the author's enthusiasm really comes through; a great introduction to a fascinating people.	2003-03-31

Much has been made of the tragic events in Carl Perkins' life, but in the end his values and personal strength stood him in much better stead than most of his Sun contemporaries (see Escott and Hawkin's book on Sun Records). Pretty good for a kid who, with his brothers, were so poor that they were skinny from  undernourishment as children. This book follows Carl from childhood until  near the end (he passed away shortly after publication). The section on the  Tennessee tonk scene in the 40's and 50's and \\"tush hogs\\" is  especially colorful.	1999-12-06
US	52169636	R38EIEA1WBHHBC	0820319163	141100340	The Black O	Books	5	9	9	N	N	tops	The mega class-action discrimination suit against Shoney's in the 90's appears to have been overshadowed by the better publicized case against Denny's occuring about the same time. But the flagrant and pervasive  discrimination shown by Shoney's management toward its own staff is  shocking stuff (Supervisiors were told to blacken the \\"o\\" in  \\"Shoneys\\" to identify job applications from minority applicants).  Terrific book - it reads like a detective novel and is hard to put down.  Well-written and highly recommended.    P.S. Note that this book was first promoted at the top of a well-known commercial publisher's list, but inexplicably dropped before going to press -- presumably due to legal threats from an offended source. It's out of print now; get it if you can!	1999-12-06
US	52169636	R3SOCMQ90WHR2P	0385487517	73623014	Rat Pack Confidential	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good read	This book was an excellent and interesting read and provided an insightful picture into this period of American culture. The author correctly emphasizes that the Rat Pack's brief ascendency came at the end of an era  for vaudeville-influenced performers but coexisted with rock 'n roll. The  author's casual, sometimes flippant writing style seemed to be an attempt  to be &quot;hip&quot; or &quot;nineties&quot; or something; I found this  distracting and annoying at times, but overall the book reads very well.	1999-12-01

It very nicely documents the rise of the hamburger and White Castle in 1920's America. Hogan follows White Castle through the early times, when a man could work there and make enough to support a  family, through the depression, the rough war years, and more recent  competition with the fast food giants. I'm not sure why he waited until the  last two pages to tell readers what makes White Castle special and has  enabled it to persist for so long....but this is a minor complaint.  Excellent!	1999-12-01
