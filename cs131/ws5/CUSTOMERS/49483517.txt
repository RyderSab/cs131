Response to review below... <br /> <br />I can see the point of the reviewer below in regards to George R.R. Martin and Terry Goodkind's work as excerpted or relating to their best-selling series.  But I think this review is missing some details. <br /> <br />First the collection is titled \\"Year's Best Fantasy\\", not \\"Best fantasy this editor could find from your very favorite authors that you have never seen before `cuz I picked their brains for fresh stuff and then they promised never to use any of it again in a series\\".  This kind of anthology is ALWAYS made up of the good, the bad and the excerpted.  <br /> <br />Second collections are great for those already in love with the genera, but I have a sneaking suspicion that they are really about drawing in the readers who do not normally seek out Fantasy books.  Although I like Sci/Fi and Fantasy work just fine I would NEVER have picked up George R.R. Martin's beefy series Song of Ice and Fire series without this intro to the series. The series is just too far off my usual list of interest. <br /> <br />  I do sympathize with the other reviewer, if you have read it already then if feels like you're being cheated.  But you can't really think that every anthology ever would have only fresh new stories. If having excerpts pulls even a few readers over, then so much the better. <br /> <br />	2005-06-11

It is still not clear to me if the authors of this book are trying to be cute or serious.  There are some real suggestions, the \\"13 point body makeover for being attractive to women\\" is true but falls into the \\"if you don't already know this you have no chance\\" category.  The lists of \\"four easiest places to meet women\\" and \\"nine secret places to meet women\\" are not where I as a woman would be looking for a man at best, and at worst are dumb places for men to hang out and not look grossly out of place.  I am sure there are man friendly yoga classes, but please don't think meeting women there is a great idea.  This book is more what you would expect a 17 year old to study and practice than a grown man.  I would give this book to both my teenage boys and girls.  The boys could use it as a refresher of what the other sex is looking for in a partner and certainly gain some confidence with dating.  The girls could see what kind of silly tricks the boys are up to, and be better able to play along or defend themselves accordingly.	2005-02-16
US	49483517	R2OEYDUW9CDSLC	078144165X	840969768	Cracking Da Vinci's Code: You've Read the Fiction, Now Read the Facts	Books	1	20	55	N	N	Stay away from this book. These men are dangerous.	This is without a doubt the worst book I have read in a very long time.  Under the guise of helping the reader separate the fact from the fiction Garlow and Jones have created a hateful piece of propaganda.  There are so many things wrong with Cracking, that I hardly know where to start.  The writing is insulting, most if not all of the arguments are repetitive and have only circular logic, the authors skew history as much as they accuse Brown of doing, and in the end all that surfaces is a list of things the authors believe are bad.  All the questions come from the \\"how to craft leading questions to get the answers we want\\" school of writing which is just insulting to even the most unsophisticated readers. <br /> <br />Make no mistake where The da Vinci Code was a mediocre work of fiction, (for a better read try Eco's work) Cracking, is a Non-Fiction/Christian Living/Contemporary Issues work of poison.  While the idea that people are reading The Code and taking it for fact, the idea that people are taking Cracking seriously is far more disturbing to me. <br /> <br />Garlow and Jones make both open and thinly veiled attacks on everyone who is not them, and despite this list of people who are going to hell, I never could find just what exactly the authors thought was the Right/Christian way to live.  Go figure.  Weirdly enough, at least to me, the authors approve of Mel Gibson's Passion.  One would think that the work was tinged enough with apocryphal and extra-Biblical work, along with the deathbed visions of German Nun Ann Catherine Emmerich to scare off Garlow and Jones' purist pretensions.  Apparently not. <br /> <br />Just in case you wonder the authors hate all the usual suspects gays, lesbians, \\"feminists\\" (which for reasons unknown is always written this way), pagans, Muslims, Jews and the Catholic Church, the occult, Women's study groups, premarital sex, and abortion.  But there are some kind of surprises, they also hate smokers, drinkers, single moms, smallfamilies, birth control, anything Eastern that is therefore tinged with Paganism including yoga, chanting, music, meditation, women in the work force and out of the home, free thinking, liberals and liberal collages, anyone who disagrees with them, immodest dress on women, authors who write about subjects they disagree with including Shirley MacLaine, Sue Monk Kid, Elaine Pagels and Dominique Crosson, along with  a whole host of other people, places, things and thoughts. <br /> <br />There is a very negative message to this book that extends way beyond guiding readers away from Browns writings.  The authors truly believe the reason we feel as thought something is broken is because something is broken.  The reason we feel guilty is because we are guilty. (231)  They think there is a very real spiritual war going on in America and that Christians are looking religious and political power to have things their way. (227)  The authors also vehemently criticize what they call the Goddess bringing good news.  In Garlow and Jones own words it is wrong to hope for or think that the Goddess will put our world together again.  Humankind is wrong to think that She will unite ecological wisdom, economic justice, human rights, women's liberation, equality and harmony between the sexes, pan-sexual freedom, personal significance, global peace, religious unity, utopian dreams, life on our own terms, and deep spirituality. (222)  They offer nothing as an alternative, not even a hearty read your Bible and see what you are missing. <br /> <br /> <br />These men are dangerous.  Not only do they believe that those who do not worship as they do are absolutely wrong, they are actively campaigning for others to believe the same way.  With all their explaining, circle talking and insistence on \\"The Truth\\" Garlow and Jones do not ever clearly articulate what it is exactly that they believe.  All the reader is left with is page after page of hateful, argumentative, ugly reasoning why everyonewho is different is wrong. <br /> <br />	2005-02-16

Although I do have several complaints about The Plague Tales and its sequel, the two books are still better than many things out there.  People complain about this work like there are so many better works to read, and yet many fail to mention a single other suggestion....  I read this book over a weekend, during a horrible winter storm while my husband who had recentally had two serious surgeries, was very sick with the flu.  The combination of constant snow and wind, a total lack of sleep, my husband alternatlly wracked with chills or burning with feaver and unable to keep any kind of food or drink in him made this book more real than I hope to experiance again.  I have yet to read a historical book that is compleatly accurate, by the way Hot Zone is truely more fiction than fact, and far less intertaining than The Plague Tales.	2002-02-05

There are NO real sexual feelings or contact between the characters and the historical corectness of the setting is dubious at best.  The harsh realities of child brides, medieval food and real life in general would mare this simple, light story.  Despite its faults the story is warm and would be appropriate for most any age reader.  I read &quot;Silent Knight&quot; in a day and felt quite upbeat afterwards, unlike some of the more historical romances I get involved in.  I would not recomend this work for a real life look at England in the Middle Ages, but it is a good start for young or jaded readers.	2002-01-08

The review who thinks this is all &quot;Kiddie Porn&quot; is missing the point.  I am a faithfull reader of Small's work in part because of the lush love scenes, but more importantally as a historian I appriciate the HISTORICAL ACCURACY of her work.  IF the &quot;Kiddie Prorn&quot; reviewer had botherd to look at ANY crediable history book she would know that women were married young throughout most of history.  Try the Gies brothers work &quot;Life in a Medieval Castle&quot; it is very easy to understand and points out that Women could be married at 12 and usually married by 14, girls as young a 4 were married and could consumate the marriage as soon as their parents aggreed.  It is politcally correct to disapprove of young girls having sexual feelings and acting on them...  The fact is throughout history women have been pressed into, or allowd to consumate a marriage in thier teen and pre-teen years.  The historical accuracy Small presents is what keeps me coming back for more, I can make the distinction between REALITY, FICTION and HISTORY.	2001-08-15

I buy a black lace book every time I order from Amazon as a treat for myself.  &quot;Cruel Enchantment&quot; arrived with books for a class and I have faild so far to read 2 books for school on time because of Ms. Ashbless' book!!  All of the tales are erotic and exciting but it is the story about Sheldi and the dragon that has given me the most pause.  I have read it over and over and think about it constantally.  I am very much obsessed with this story and embroider on it in great detail in my mind.  The first time I read the story I barely finished before attacking my unsuspecting husband.  It took him a few days to see the link between &quot;that little black book&quot; and my activity... and I'm proud to say I have a whole new collection of dragon sleep wear and we have a new fantasy.  I can not thank Ms. Ashbless enough for this book and for the dragon tale in particular.  This is a collection not to be missed.  Even though it touches on subjects and ideas that seem repelent in many ways, the writing convays the erotic in it.  I found myself at times thinking how could she have even thought to write about this?  Somehow each story comes off.  I must agree with several other reviewers, each of these stories could and should be a whole book unto themselves.  The only down point for me is I don't know how long it will be before I get the chance to read another collection this fine.	2001-06-07

I read this book when it first came out, and found it interesting, but confusing...who was that person again?  Where were they going?  Why is this important?  I did like the premise of the story, but just couldn't remember what was going on.  Now five years later after rereading The Alienist I find it much easier going.  This second time around I found the charachters less confusing, the plot a bit better to follow and, although I couldn't remember who did it, I was not left wondering what had happend.  I did find that I was not at all distressed by the blood and gore discriptions in the novel.  When diffrent individuals in the book were shocked at a scene I felt nothing.  This is a bit disturbing, am I at 23 so jaded?  Are we as 20th Century citizens over the horror of murder.  I think mabey so, and yet neither I nor my husband or parents can really muster up concern over it.  It just seems facinating that people were so horrified by murder when you could walk around the corner and pick up a bottle of Laudnum and a child prostitute.	2001-02-14

The Outlander and I have a special relationship, and for others to read it and know about it would be embarrasing.  I resisted reading this book when it was recomended to me, and I have never told the person who recomended that I read it.  I can not bear to talk about the very personal feeling I have about the Outlander with others.  Weird huh?  I have never felt this attatched to a book before for this long.  I was so wrapped up in it I found myself laughing out loud, crying and barely able to leave the couch and my book for four days.  Even more strange, I read this book in early summer in the high deserts of Wyoming, it rained the whole time I was reading the book, those four days were the only time it rained all year here.  It was like the whole world wanted my to feel at home with this book.  I hope that others will pick up this whole series, just as long as they dont tell me about it!	2001-02-08

There is more sexually charged writting on the fronts of checkout stand magazines.  I have never met a librarian who has read Lolita, but it is not avalible at the local library because its &quot;pornagraphic&quot;.  I am sympathetic with the sexuality of the 12 year old girl, I was just that kind of kid.  There is so much power in being young and desirable, men will do anything for you.  Adults tend to forget or ignore the sexuality of young people, but it is there.  The most facinating aspect of Lolita for me was Humbert's fall.  He knows what he is doing is wrong, he constantally says he is aware what the public thinks, and yet he is unable to help himself.  I was very uncomfortable with this reminder of our failings.  Humbert is terrified of what he is doing, he is painfully and grossley manipulated by Lolita, and yet can not help or stop himself.  This could be the story of any relationship, men, women, drugs, money.  I would like to read the annoted eddition for a new perspective on the slippery slope of sin, Lolita.	2001-02-08

This book was enjoyable, but it did seem to lack a realistic plot line.  Haunted left me feeling like there was more story there that the author just didn't bother to write.

I don't do ornaments, or little bitty projects, even in a sampler many of these peices feel wrong.  I would rather pull from old source books, or even Mary Engelbriet for add ins like these.  Some stitchers may find it usefull, but I have never actually used a pattern out of this book.	2001-01-10

They cover the biggies and touch on the lesser known but important works.  There are ample illustrations and notations to diagrams and photographs.  The writing is interesting and not full of boring technical jargan.  This book is an excelent jumping off point for a time period or to get an overview of architecture in general.  There is so much information one could get bogged down in, especially in the past century of architecture, but Wodehouse and Moffett charge on ahead without becoming stuck.  This book is certanily not the end all of any time period, but for casual scholors of architecture or those who need to know about a building in X time period, this a great book.	2000-10-16
US	49483517	R1JG680FG3RZBQ	1872501761	255165088	Book Illumination in the Middle Ages. (Studies in Medieval and Early Renaissance Art History)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	The best in scholorship and illustrations	Alexander and Pacht are simpley the best in Medieval scholorship. This book has been one of my favorites since a class in Manuscriopt Illumination. This book gives the basics with out being to large to digest. It provides fantastic illustrations and bibliography that should send even the most jaded art historian to their knees with gratitude. This book is good for hard core historians, lovers of illuminated pages, medieval history or art buffs and any one in love with line, color and decoration for the sake of decoration. Alexander and Pacht are clear knowledgeable writers who love to point out the details and side stories that make art and history so facinating to comb through. It is a pleasure to just turn the pages and study the art work. This book will give you a new appriciation of the \\"dark ages\\" and the legacy of art that was left for us.	2000-10-16

Goodrich has lofty aims - to bring the origional texts to the reader in her own way with a minimum of abridgement and interference. Unfortuntally the text through the whole book is just confusing. The stroy of Peredur, a distant begening of the Aurthur Legends, is so disjointed as to be unreadable. Stories are also in modern language and story form, so although Beowulf was originally a poem, it is not in this translation. It was very dissapointing to have such high hopes for a valid littery work only to be left confused by the translated text. A better work is H.A. Guerber's Middle Ages from the Myths and Legends Collection. At least that work mixes coherent modern story with noted original translation to bring home the point.	2000-10-11

It is an Indian Paitnt Brush book for 2000 and deserves the title, along of course with the Newbery Medal.  I had the good fortune to meet and listen to Mr. Sachar  and he is just as wry and interesting in real life.  This story has a nice message, and keeps the reader interested, very worthwhile.	2000-09-29
