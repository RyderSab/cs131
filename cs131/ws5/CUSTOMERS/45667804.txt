What the book shows is junky and out of step with decorating today. I got this book by mistake awhile back. I hated it then and it still looks just as bad to me today.	2003-10-17

As a designer myself (in metro LA), I bought this book as I buy many decorating books to share with my clients.  I look at the books with some of my clients as a way of learning  their likes and dislikes. It's interesting for me to observe that the people I've been working with almost immediately set this book aside after they begin to go through it and they grab for other books that may fit their likes more closely. Maybe the feel of the rooms in this book reflect a regional or city preference. I cannot help but agree with my customers who think these rooms aren't relaxed enough for modern life.	2003-10-10

This book is a relic of the past and should be allowed to die a dignified death. I challenge Rachel Ashwell to come up with something newer, more fun, and less depressing.	2003-10-10

I love Trading Spaces, and I can't get enough of the show or the new books showing rooms from the show. This book is filled with one surprising idea after another just like the show. I can't look at a Trading Spaces room without thinking about all the ways I can use those ideas themselves or use them as jumping off points for my own design plans. I am a fan of decorating books in general (occupational hazard because I am a designer), but the Trading Spaces  books are unlike any other decorating books on the market. They have a different energy and vitality. They are fresher. I also find that my design clients who watch the show and buy these books seem more open to new design ideas, which makes my job much easier.	2003-09-08

This entire book is forced, trying to be cool when it's simply a regurgitation of old ideas or commonsense basics that I've read, like, a zillion times. The book is not worth the money. I was disappointed at the book's size and how few pages it had. Add that to the fact that the pages say  nothing, and you get nothing for your money. These people are trying to sell some sort of attitude, but they aren't putting anything real or helpful behind that attitude. Personally, it makes me very angry. Don't waste your money on this.	2003-02-05

As a designer myself, I was surprised that this book was published so recently, because it looks old and dated. Fussy rooms crammed with too many cutesy touches is not something I even want to share with my design clients, so I did not keep this on the bookshelf in my office.	2003-01-09

It is intriguing to see how other people decorate with their collections. The book features styles that go from modern to traditional. I've shared this book with my design clients to show them that they can edit and organize their favorite collectibles to create well-designed rooms. Lots of good design information here plus tips on specific hot collectibles. This book is a real find.	2003-01-09

The Euro style thread that runs through the book represents a soft old world quality that is sophisticated and comforting at the same time. The book is full of good ideas. The only thing I didn't care for was the author's naive, golly-gee-wiz tone in writing about her own trip to Paris.	2002-04-19

Even though the information is not new or original, I do like having this writer's quick tips close at hand for reference. The photos leave something to be desired, because so many of them are little closeups of objects when I would rather see whole rooms.	2001-06-14

The homes are beautiful and range from old and new, rustic and traditional, with lots of cottage charm and warmth. But not &quot;kitschy&quot; or cutesy. But the homes are also accessible. This book makes me feel that I really can have the weekend house I've always wanted. Great if you have or want to find a second home but the book works, too, if you're only looking for some &quot;getaway style&quot; decorating ideas. I like the resource list in the back of the book with website addresses for getaway home plans and furnishings.	2001-06-14

I like edgy design and doing my own thing, but what this book promotes is simply tasteless trash. It is a disservice to those readers who don't know any better. From what I could read about the author, this person operates a store of some sort, which explains the junk-store look of the featured rooms.	2001-06-14

Maybe it was the unexpectedly small size of the book. Maybe it was the superficiality of simply being shown a scattering of getaways and reading about what other people did. What can I do? I searched for \\"second homes\\" books on amazon.com and found one called Second Home, which is bigger and more inspiring than the Getaways book but which also talks to me about my own dreams and needs. As a designer, I have used the quizzes in the book to guide my clients in deciding what they really want, too.	2001-06-07

As a designer, I appreciate the well-designed homes and interiors and the fact that this book puts a fresh 2001 spin on a classic design style. It looks to me as if most of the featured homes are vacation or weekend homes, which may explain the casual,freewheeling feeling that the photographs impart. This is one of two favorite books on my reading table at the moment. <br />The other favorite is another yummy getaway book  - called  Second Home  -  which shows a broader range of home and interior design styles, all set in fabulous getaway locations.	2001-06-06

I agree that one can find southwest style in many parts of the country, but it often doesn't &quot;move&quot; well to those locations. As a designer, I see that the colors and materials often do not easily move from the southwest to another region, in part because the natural colors of the landscape and the color of the light itself change when you go to another part of the country. I wish that this book had made that point and helped readers translate the ideas.	2001-03-21

I have bought several second home books recently, and my favorite remains a new book called Second Home, which shows not only log and timberframe homes but airy beach cottages, cabins in the woods, lake homes, and every other style one can imagine.	2001-03-08

The photos look more like bad snapshots of boring, cold rooms. Totally uninspiring. As a homeowner and a designer, I like the idea of working with what I already have, but many decorating books help me do that while also showing me beautiful yet believable photos of rooms. I am always tweaking what I already have, and my favorite decorating book remains The New Decorating Book. Another favorite is Flea Market Decorating.	2001-03-08

As a designer, I find this book stunning in its variety of home types and interior design styles. As  house lover, I also get drawn into the homes and the stunning photographs of settings from coast to coast. As a West Coast resident, I admit that I did not realize that the Midwest had so much to offer. Few books cover the country as this one from Better Homes and Gardens does.The book is wonderful to look at, but it includes information anyone can use if they are shopping or dreaming about buying a second home. Very useful. As a designer, I plan to use some of the quizzes in one of the book's chapters, because they help people understand more about their goals and style and also help partners compare their reactions to homes and settings. A great book.	2001-03-07

I have trouble understanding the reviewer who thought the writing sounded snobbish or felt the book was simply for the wealthy. Understand his principles of design, and you can use those to do a great room with low-cost IKEA furniture if you want to.	2001-02-28

The first book I saw on the subject was also called Garden Style Decorating, I believe, but it was by Better Homes and Gardens. The Better Homes and Gardens book has a fresher look and a wider variety of styles.	2001-02-23

As a designer working for clients who have a wide range of style goals, I find this disappointing. This TV personality's design range is narrow, at best, and there are not very many rooms or projects in the book, once you get into it. I look for books to give or loan to clients to help thtem get a grasp of all the possibilties and of the basics of design, and this book is NOT one that I can use in my work. I recommend The New Decorating Book, which is broad in style and which explains design in ways that anyone can understand.	2001-02-01

The project sounded simple until the builder began asking questions about the details of the final look and finish last fall. We didn't know where to begin to get ideas. I searched for &quot;fireplaces&quot; at amazon and found this book, which is excellent. There is a lot of information in the book but just as important as that are all the big color photos of all kinds of fireplaces. We were able to mark all the ones we liked and then show the builder exactly what we had in mine. In our case, he was going to build a big boxy thing right up to the ceiling, but we showed several examples of chimneys that stepped back from the fire box. Inspired by the cover and another shot inside the book, we also decided to angle the sides of the chimney enclosure and add textured plaster for an old world look. The book also helped us create a better furniture arrangement to focus on the fire and to &quot;direct traffic&quot; around the furniture grouping.	2001-01-24

I wasn't disappointed, either. It shows styles ranging from serene and pared down to kitschy, but each of them is lovable and cottage-cozy. And that is what we want in our home. I design all kinds of rooms for clients, but when I get home I want to sink into overstuffed chairs and have my favorite things around me. I have a lot of clients, too, who want me to use cottage furnishings and fabrics to turn their homes into &quot;weekend cottages.&quot; As a designer, I appreciate the fact that the book doesn't promote cluttered decorating but offers sound design advice on mixing colors, fabric patterns, and arranging collections and furnishings. This is a happy, snug little book on a style that never seems to die.	2001-01-23

I love to sit and dream with great photos of retreats, but we couldn't relate to many of those shown here. Still, this is a nice little book.  I highly recommend another new book called Second Home, which is large and colorful and mixes tours of real homes around the country (everything from oceanside homes and lake cottages to mountain cabins) with practical tips on finding the right location for us, and on building, decorating, remodeling, and so on. My husband and I keep grabbing Second Home away from each other as we go from picture to picture. (We found Second Home at Border's, but I now see that amazon stocks it.  I don't know why it hasn't turned up on amazon's recommendations or &quot;new and notable&quot; lists yet.)	2001-01-19

Pass, I bought this and also bought a book called Second Home. Both are great. This Cabin Fever book is limited to homes that are a bit more rustic than what we had in mind, but we still love it. Second Home also is a gorgeous dream book but it has a wider variety of home and decorating styles. Second Home also has given us a lot of information on how to shop for a retreat, how to decide what location is best for us, as well as tips on decorating and building. Second Home approaches the topic from a broader perspective.	2001-01-19

I have found this book invaluable. It's like a boiled-down &quot;Cliff's notes&quot; of design, which is great for my customers and for me. It puts interior design precents into language anyone can understand. I use the book in my work and also give it to clients as gifts. I also use it for some of my own decorating inspiration.

Being free from rigid rules and old-fashioned design ideas is great, but it is amazing how many times I see rooms that look like those in this book when I am called in on a job.

But it is limited (as its title says, of course) to one style that is a bit more rustic than what we have in mind. Still, this is a lovely book to peruse. As we gather information on vacation homes, our favorite book is a new one called Second Home, which includes visits to everything from oceanside homes and lake cottages to mountain cabins. Second Home also includes information on how to shop for a second home, how to decide what location is right, and tips on building, decorating and so on. I've never met a vacation house book I didn't like, and I like them all. But Second Home is our favorite because it has such variety of home styles and helpful tips in it.	2001-01-19
