This was the first book I've read by this author in a while but I will be back for more. <br /> <br />The characters are believable, the plot was well developed and the ending wrapped up all the loose ends very nicely. <br />	2005-09-10

This is another that I can recommend to anyone who is a fan of the medical thriller. <br /> <br />The plot is straightforward: discover a cure for influenza which involves altering our DNA. Of course, you have your ego-maniac who wants to profit from the discovery and your hero who wants to help humanity. <br /> <br />All in all, a great read and one I can thoroughly recommend.	2005-08-22

The Third Secret is one of the best books I've ever read in my life of 35 years-and I'm a very avid reader. First, let me say that if you are Catholic and are not inclined to be open-minded, you probably shouldn't read it, since you will probably be offended. <br /> <br />However, if you are open to possibilities and different viewpoints, this book can't be beat for questioning the theological basis for traditional Catholic practices, such as celibacy for priests. <br /> <br />The plot opens around the events that took place at Fatima, Portugal in the early 20th century. Three peasant girls were visited by the Virgin Mary and told three secrets, two of which were immediately made public, the third not revealed until 2000. It is this third secret which is the focus of the book, that is, the part of the secret which wasn't revealed by the Pope at in 2000.  <br /> <br />The main focus of the book is that there are only three people left alive who know the entire contents of the third secret, one of which has great ambitions of becoming Pope. The current Pope and an aging priest in Romania are the other two. The ambitious Cardinal is out to ensure that the rest of the secret isn't revealed. <br /> <br />This is all I'll say, lest I ruin the book. I will say that it is at least the equal of DaVinci Code, if not better. However, while the DaVinci Code was more of an Indiana Jones story, the Third Secret is a little more political.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: this book gets five stars all the way!!!!!	2005-08-21
US	25139013	R1MMM6WN7JMJEG	0385337116	520405863	The Rule of Four	Books	2	3	4	N	N	A very average book	I checked this out from my library because I thought it would compare to the DaVinci Code. Boy, was I wrong.  <br /> <br />The first 100 pages are filled with flashbacks that are not relevant to the story. I nearly put it down for good but it started to get better at that point. However, the author only devotes about 75 pages to the mystery of the ancient book the main characters are trying to decipher. The last 100 pages were somewhat more interesting. <br /> <br />Althought the premise is good, the author trys to combine a Davinci Code-like plot with a coming of age story-it doesn't work, believe me. I'll probably give the author one more shot  but that will be it.	2005-08-06
US	25139013	R3MEL910WBM9DJ	0345460065	428222705	The Romanov Prophecy: A Novel	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Best book I've read in a while	This book was fantastic!!!! I love a good suspense novel and this definitely fits the bill. <br /> <br />This plot is simple: Russia has decided to bring back the monarchy and Miles Lord is to do a background check on the leading candidate. He discovers, however, that a direct descendant of the last Tsar could be alive. There is a group who doesn't want a direct descendant to be made Tsar and therein is the bulk of the book. <br /> <br />Contrary to what other reviewers said, this book is believable. Yes, some literary license is taken but that's why it's a FICTION novel. I loved the characters, esp. Lord and enjoyed how he assembled each piece of the puzzle, while dodging those who would do him in. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book and can hardly wait to read The Amber Room and The Third Secret.	2005-08-06

The book brings back Laurie Montgomery and her lover, Jack Stapleton to investigate a series of mysterious deaths, all similar but at different hospitals. In the background, Jack and Laurie are trying to redefine their relationship.  <br /> <br />As always, Cook keeps the reader on the edge of one's seat from the first page to the last. Being a doctor himself, Cook sprinkles in a wide array of medical jargon and this only make the book more interesting. As always, the book is well researched. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the medical thriller and other authors such as Tess Gerritson and Michael Palmer, you will enjoy Marker. <br /> <br />	2005-08-06
US	25139013	R3HOY9HGPB87W8	0525243828	222810062	The Seventh Secret	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Good but ending is too abrupt	I bought this book used becaused it seemed based on a very interesting premise-that Hitler had actually survived WWII instead of committing suicide as history teaches us. <br /> <br />I thought the story flowed well and the mix of characters was quite good. That being said, I thought it ended rather abruptly, with the disappearance of Eva Braun. I would like to have seen an epilogue of some sort to wrap things up.  <br /> <br />Since Wallace has supposedly passed away, I guess I can't look forward to more books by him. However, the book is a quick read, although not nearly as good as some others I've read.	2005-07-20
US	25139013	RMCRNF3IC6MRO	0345450175	290245844	Balance Of Power	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Fantastic book!!!!! One of Patterson's best.	I absolutely loved this book. I am not sure whether or not I've read the previous Kilcannon books but I will definitely read them if I haven't.<br /><br />Let me say that if you are an NRA member who believes, as the NRA appears to, that everyone, regardless of criminal history has a right to own a gun, then this book will probably tick you off. That being said, the book is very detailed and I believe realistic regarding the politics surrounding gun control.<br /><br />The plot is one you might expect for a story focusing on gun control: the brother-in-law of the President kills his wife, daughter, mother-in-law and several other innocent civilians at an airport in California. The gun he used was a \\"P-2,\\" a very deadly weapon when combined with \\"Eagle's Claw\\" bullets, which literally shred the inside of one's target.<br /><br />The remainder of the book focuses on Kilcannon trying to get a law passed to require background checks for gun show customers, while the Sons of the Second Amendment (read \\"NRA\\") are lobbying for \\"gun immunity,\\" which would prevent victims and their families from suing a gun manufacturer for wrongful death. That's all I'll say so that I won't ruin the book for you.<br /><br />Again, I highly recommend this book.	2005-07-16

I love to cook, so I plan to try some of the recipes from the book. <br /> <br />I agree with the other reviewers in that it is a light, easy read. If you're looking for something with a real deep plot, better pass this one by. On the otherhand, if you are looking for something that doesn't require a lot of concentration and that can easily be read in a week or less, I recommend this book. <br /> <br />I will be back for more of Goldy.	2005-07-10
US	25139013	RF6924S6S69S8	0345448367	532522277	Darwin's Children	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Interesting sequel but quite complex	First, let me say that I enjoyed this book tremendously, could hardly put it down. I liked the character development and all the action sequences. Second, I can definitely relate the political storylines to modern-day America. I, myself, am a moderate but can definitely see who some political figures in the book were based on. I agree with other reviewers that this is not a stand-alone book-the first one should definitely be read first. <br /> <br />Now, some constructive criticism. The book gets quite complex and at times, I wasn't sure how a given sequence related to the overall story. I also agree that the book just kind of ended and that there were loose ends that needed tying up. These are the biggest reasons why I couldn't give 4 stars.	2005-06-30
US	25139013	R1P9IHEI9HK7EU	0553273108	515391319	Favorite Son	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Good book but.......	Well, this is the first book I've ever read by this author-indeed I don't know if he's written any more. While the book was, in general, well written, it was a little complex. What I mean is this: at 520+ pages and more characters than you could shake a stick at, at times I found myself having to backtrack to figure out what was going on or why something had happened. If it weren't for this fact, I'd give the book four stars but because the same story could have been told in about 100 fewer pages without losing anything, I can give it no more than three. <br /> <br />	2005-06-25

Although it gets rather technical concerning viruses and DNA, this shouldn't be considered a deterrent to reading this novel.  I believe this is the first book I've read by Bear and can hardly wait to read its sequel, as well as other Bear novels. The characters were well developed, the plot feasible and the ending believable. I can highly recommend this book to anyone who is a sci-fi fan.	2005-06-16

Although the book was interesting, I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned there were too many characters to keep track of. The book did ramble a bit and at times I found myself completely confused  as to what was going on and how the characters were connected. <br /> <br />Having said this, I will try Jan Burke again-I bought Bloodlines at a Library Book Sale-before I write her off completely.	2005-06-08

I've now realized that I should have read Wild Justice first to understand some of what Amanda is going thru and why. However, this is an excellent stand alone book in my opinion. <br /> <br />The characters and plot were well developed. The conclusion was logical and made sense give the facts that were laid out for the reader and there is a twist at the end that, for me at least, was unexpected. <br /> <br />I will be back for more of Margolin's excellent work.	2005-06-01
US	25139013	R1EOJIRLMCEE55	0451411013	304194385	The Grave Maurice	Books	2	3	6	N	N	A Grave rewrite is needed	Well, I'm not sure how to begin. While the back cover synopsis is intriguing, the execution leaves something to be desired. The book was by far one of the least well written that I've read. Grimes is constantly going off on tangents that seem to have no bearing on the story. I found myself lost several times and having to go back and figure out what was supposed to be happening. <br /> <br />The only reason I gave this book 2 stars instead of one was that the author seemed to get back on track for the last 50-75 pages.  <br /> <br />Overall, I cannot recommend this book and will only give the author one more try before \\"writing\\" her off completely.	2005-05-27

I thought it was well written and kept my attention well. My first Coulter book was Hemlock Bay and I enjoyed that as well. <br /> <br />I esp. like the character interaction and the two-pronged plot. I can recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery novel. I will definitely be back for more.	2005-05-20

This was my first introduction to Jon Land and I loved it! It has an interesting plot and excellent character development. There are no loose ends at the conclusion. <br /> <br />I will be seeking out more Jon Land books to read, of that there is no doubt.	2005-05-18

I haven't read \\"Legacies\\" and might should have before reading this book. However, this is a good book and I actually enjoyed the variety of conspiracy theories that are put forth. <br /> <br />There are parts where it seems a little disjointed and I will agree with another reviewer that the SESOUP Sunday schedule being placed on the last page is a bit odd and could be an editorial error. However, I consider that a minor issue. <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you enjoy books that are a little far-out, you should enjoy this one. I can definitely recommend it.	2005-05-01

I have been a Ludlum fan for years and was greatly saddened at his death. I hope that there are other books that he left outlines for that his estate might find a ghost writer for. <br /> <br />This book has all the trademarkes of a great spy novel-action romance and plenty of surprises. I encourage any fan of Clancy to try Ludlum as well.	2005-04-24

It falls just short of the talent that Cussler has. While I'm not so disappointed that I won't read more of him, there's just something missing that I can't quite put my finger on. For instance, the treasure is supposed to have been there for \\"a thousand years,\\" yet the books states that the treasure sunk to the bottom about 300 years earlier.    But anyway, I will seek out other books by him, so I can recommend this book as an entertaining one.	2005-04-17

It did get a little tedious at times (though not nearly to the extent that you find with Clancy) but I managed to make it thru. I do plan to go back and read the first book in the series, as well as the subsequent ones. <br /> <br />The story was believable, as were the characters. The author also seemed to know his material. All in all, I enjoyed this book and look forward to more work by Cobb.	2005-04-09

This is the second book I've read of George's and it was fantastic! The plot was well-developed and very believable. E.

This is one of his very early works and pales in comparison to most modern thrillers. However, considering it was written 30+ years ago, it is somewhat intersting. <br /> <br />One additional note: I wouldn't recommend this as a first read for someone new to Ludlum, because it might turn a person off permanently.	2005-02-21

This is yet another big winner for the author. There are numerous twists and turns and the plot is full of surprises. <br /> <br />If you like a book full of action, I can highly recommend this one. While numerous books have been written dealing with Islamic terrorist scenarios, Liberty is unusually detailed and Coonts develops the plot really well.	2004-11-13

It is one laugh after another from beginning to end, starting with the band's discussion over an infomercial. I read the book in a couple of hours (not consecutive) and there are only a few books I've read so fast. <br />This is not a deep book and reveals no universal truths-if that's what you are seeking, don't read it. However, if you're looking for a way to spend a rainy afternoon, I can heartily recommend Tricky Business.	2004-05-08

It took me less than a week to finish it. Whether or not everything was historically accurate to the letter wasn't important to me-rather, I found the ideas presented to be intriguing, even if some literary license was used.<br />Any open-minded person will enjoy this book. However, if you are close-minded and not open to different interpretations of religious doctrine, don't read this book-it will only upset you.<br />I'm already reading my second D.

However, I figured out about halfway thru it that there would probably be a sequel. <br />I will say that it got a bit mundane when all the cousins were doing was taking out various Arabs with poison. They didn't appear to be challenged at all.<br />I think there is potential for a new series with Jack Jr. and his cousins but this wouldn't be the best way to start it.	2003-10-23
