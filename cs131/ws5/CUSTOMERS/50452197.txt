By studying patterns in the ETS answer choices and question sequences, Princeton Review came up with what it calls the Joe Blog approach. At its core, Joe Blog says that on easy questions, go for the obvious answer that Joe Blog (a hypothetical Joe-Average) would guess; on the hard ones, avoid the \\"obvious answers, because they are \\"tricks\\" to fool Joe Blog.  Even for top scorers, the Joe Blog techniques could add points by increasing the odds of successfully making educated guesses on the toughest questions. Moreover, the Princeton Review writers do provide excellent practice beyond the Joe Blog approach. They seem to have studied the content of the test better than most authors. If there is one flaw, it is that the explanations to the practice questions need a lot of work.     While not perfectfor everyone, this book is still an important and helpful resource.

I certainly agree with what the commenter, who works for Princeton Review, says, \\"nothing prepares you more for the real thing than doing real problems on real exams. That's what this book offers.\\"  <br /> <br />The problem is that, with a few exceptions, these are NOT \\"real\\" SAT questions. They are Princeton Review exams that are similar to the SATs, but not as well-written (nor as hard) as those prepared by the pros at ETS. Plus, the explantions for the verbal answers are not terribly edifying (the math answers are OK.) Princeton's own Cracking the SATs is a better book because its practice drills and tips are brilliant (Joe Blog, etc), even though its tests have the same problem. (Note, however, they are far superior to those of Kaplan and Barrons, which isn't saying much.) Recommendation: buy Princeton Review's Cracking the New SAT 2006, and get a free copy of a genuine SAT when you register for the SAT. <br /> <br />	2005-10-05

Contrary to the information posted on some MBA chat sites,  most of the reading questions and the CR questions are carried over from the 10th edition and/or the retired tests sold in PDF format on the MBA official store. (I haven't checked the math as thoroughly, but it looks pretty similar.) So if you have the 10th, you won't get as much as you might hope from buying this new edition. You will get what GMAT calls \\"improved\\" explanations. Improved? Maybe. They're still pretty circular at times (eg, D is correct because it's uh....correct), but they do seem more detailed and better organized. The two supplemantal volumes, one on verbal and one on math are pretty much the same story, old questions, \\"improved\\" explanations. They are all good study tools, just not as new as the GMAT folks would like us to believe.	2005-09-30

But this was not what I found. Instead of heart-felt reflection, in this bizarre memoir, Jane Fonda conveys minutiae that divides her \\"life so far\\" into three \\"acts,\\" running on about her childhood, first films, and her politics, but never saying anything I could take back with me. Evasive and rather superficial,Jane Fonda's My Life So Far falls apart due to meanderings and (rather pathetic) self-promotion. Sure, I love her movies, but this book offers almost nothing of interest to serious readers. Read the interviews with her (for free) and save your money.	2005-05-10

Buckley's God and Man at Yale	<br />The modern iteration of William F. Buckley's classic God and Man at Yale, conservative commentator Ross Gregory Douthat's  main arguments have a much broader concern than Harvard, namely, his disquiet with the present state of the American college experience. While the examples center on Harvard, the book is really  a crtical rumination on students, parents, and administrators and professors who view elite colleges merely as stepping-stones to high salaries and elite social networks rather than the keepers of the flame of learning and academic excellence. As Tom Wolfe did in his fictional I am Charlotte Simmons, he also focuses on the moral guidance (or lack thereof) regarding sexual relations,  career, and social relations at today's universities.  All in all a thought provoking book, told from a somewhat conservative perspective (which to his credit, the author makes clear where he is coming from.)	2005-05-07

Friedman's concern is that we stopped paying notice to these developments due to the dot-com bust, 9/11 and the Iraq conflict. But these trends have really began to gather speed. He argues persuasively that globalization is determined not by corporations or colossal trade organizations like the World Bank, but by people in India,China and elsewhere in the developing world. They know how to compete--and triumph--not just for low-wage industrialized toil but, increasingly, for high end, white collar work as well. Friedman tells his tale with a firm sort of sanguinity. He wants to tell you how stimulating this new-fangled planet is, but he also wants you to recognize you're going to be flattened if you don't keep up with it. His book a great read. <br />	2005-05-02

He argues that such reinvested dividends are the true source of stock returns, or the \\"El Dorado.\\" (His term). Overall, this argument is well-presented and persuasive.     However, I am perplexed on a key element. His case is largely based on historical evidence that purports to show that high dividend yield stocks, with dividends reinvested, have accumulated more total return than growth stocks or index mutual funds. However, his calculations do not account for the deleterious effect of taxes on reinvested dividend. (He says in an endnote that taxes are not significant for the portfolios he chose, but does not explain why; for most common stock portfolios, taxes are significant.) Dividends are taxed yearly and until recently at a higher rate than that of capital gains and that of retained earnings, which are not taxed at all. If taxes have been paid on dividends, only the untaxed part can truly be considered \\"reinvested\\"; the part that is taxed has to be made up by a new infusions of cash from the investor. The effect of ignoring this is that his historical comparisons are not terribly meaningful because he is not calculating the returns on true (after tax) contributions to dividend stocks vs. growth stocks. Naturally, if more is contributed to the dividend stocks, there is likely to be more at the end. (BTW, this is basically the same fallacy that sunk the allegedly huge returns of the otherwise delightful \\"Beardstown Ladies\\" of yore.) Given that the magnitude of the \\"advantage\\" he posits of dividend stocks vs. growth stocks is not all that great, one cannot have confidence that he has truly made his case.     That said, his advice is very useful for investors in tax sheltered 401Ks. Also, the new lower tax rate on dividends also helps lessen, though not eliminate, the effects of yearly taxation of dividends.	2005-03-12

It's downhill from there.    The foreword contains another comma-free nonrestrictive clause (\\"I feel no such sympathy for the manager of my local supermarket who must have a cellarful of apostrophes he doesn't know what to do with\\") and a superfluous ellipsis. The preface includes a misplaced apostrophe (\\"printers' marks\\") and two misused semicolons: one that separates unpunctuated items in a list and one that sets off a dependent clause. About half the semicolons in the rest of the book are either unnecessary or ungrammatical, and the comma is deployed as the mood strikes. Sometimes, phrases such as \\"of course\\" are set off by commas; sometimes, they are not. Doubtful, distracting, and unwarranted commas turn up in front of restrictive phrases (\\"Naturally we become timid about making our insights known, in such inhospitable conditions\\"), before correlative conjunctions (\\"Either this will ring bells for you, or it won't\\"), and in prepositional phrases (\\"including biblical names, and any foreign name with an unpronounced final `s'\\"). Where you most expect punctuation, it may not show up at all: \\"You have to give initial capitals to the words Biro and Hoover otherwise you automatically get tedious letters from solicitors.\\"    Parentheses are used, wrongly, to add independent clauses to the ends of sentences. Citation form varies: one passage from the Bible is identified as \\"Luke, xxiii, 43\\" and another, a page later, as \\"Isaiah xl, 3.\\" The word \\"abuzz\\" is printed with a hyphen, which it does not have. It opines that when a sentence ends with a quotation American usage always places the terminal punctuation inside the quotation marks, which is not so. (An American would not write \\"Who said `I cannot tell a lie?'\\") A line from \\"My Fair Lady\\" is misquoted (\\"The Arabs learn Arabian with the speed of summer lightning\\"). Some conventions of British usage employed in \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" are taboo in the United States-for example, the placement of commas and periods outside quotation marks, \\"like this\\". The book also omits the serial comma, as in \\"eats, shoots and leaves,\\" which is acceptable in the United States only in newspapers and commercial magazines.

The only recommended method for \\"cracking\\" the exam that I could find was the advice to read widely. I didn't need to spend good money to find that out. There is no survey or summary of the AP English Lit. syllabus, such as important books, literary movements, rhetoric or important authors to help fill in the gaps in one's knowledge. The sample tests give one a sense of the test format, but the answers won't be of much use beyond answering the particular question, in the unlikely event it shows up on the test you take.	2004-10-17

You may not need it. The College Board provides a copy of a complete New SAT test on its web site, which you can download for FREE. This book provides 8 additional tests. However, a fair number of questions are recycled from the guide to the \\"old\\" SAT, called 10 Real SATs, which you or an older sibling may already own. Also, this book provides only an answer key for each test, not the explanations. This somewhat limits its usefulness.	2004-10-13

This engaging novel addresses that question by exploring the unexpected connections in all of our lives. Eddie, a wounded war veteran, now an old man, believes he has lived a meaningless life. But has he? The \\"answer\\" is found in this warm and surprisingly clever novel, written in a style that keeps you turning the page. It's not heavy philosophy, but it made me think things over. I'm very glad I read it, and I hope many others will like it just as much.	2004-10-03

I certainly agree with what the commenter, who works for Princeton Review, says, \\"nothing prepares you more for the real thing than doing real problems on real exams. That's what this book offers.\\"    The problem is that, with a few exceptions, these are NOT \\"real\\" SAT questions. They are Princeton Review exams that are similar to the SATs, but not as well-written (nor as hard) as those prepared by the pros at ETS. Plus, the explantions for the verbal answers are not terribly edifying (the math answers are OK.) Princeton's own Cracking the SATs is a better book because its practice drills and tips are brilliant (Joe Blog, etc), even though its tests have the same problem. (Note, however, they are far superior to those of Kaplan and Barrons, which isn't saying much.)  Recommendation: buy Princeton Review's Cracking the New SAT 2005, and get a free copy of a genuine SAT when you register for the SAT.	2004-09-09

(The first is \\"10 Actual, Official LSAT\\", followed by \\"10 More Actual, Official LSAT Preptests\\" and most recently \\"10 Next Actual, Official LSAT Preptests\\"). All three books contain offcially released, actual LSATs. All are great for practicing for the real thing. One might argue, however, that by default, \\"10 Next Actual, Official LSAT Preptests (ISBN: 0942639898) is now the one to buy, simply because the tests are newer and therefore are more likely to reflect LSAC's latest thinking on question format and difficulty. Other reviewers have suggested that the LSAT seems to be recycling the structure, if not the precise problems, of so-called logic games from older tests. So it probably pays to buy this or one or both of the older test collections too, provided you have the time to study that many tests. One wonders why logic games are so important a part of this test, when every lawyer I know says they are unlike they type of legal reasoning they employ in their practice of law. But as long as they stay there, if you want to do well on the test you have to, quite literally, \\"play the game.\\"	2004-08-20

This is the first; it was followed by \\"10 More Actual, Official LSAT Preptests\\" and more recently \\"10 Next Actual, Official LSAT.\\"  All three books are fine, and each contains LSATs. However, \\"10 Next Actual, Official (ISBN: 0942639898) is by default the preferred choice because the tests are newer, reflecting the current content of the test. This is relevant, because it seems to me that the incredibly nasty \\"games and \\"logic\\" sections of the current LSAT are a bit less nasty than those given in 1992-1995, when this book was produced.	2004-08-20

For me, Graham Greene ranks with Faulkner and Conrad in his unsparingly honest, yet empathetic insight into the human heart. And, not that of great men, but of ordinary people who try hard to stay right, not always succeeding, but often failing nobly. The Heart of the Matter is to me Greene's most vivid and memorable foray into this terra incognita. Scobie is noble, flawed and fully realized. The so-called \\"invented\\" world through which he walks is so richly atmospheric that it hardly seems fictional.The plot here is a bit less animated than in some of Greene's other famous novels, but the richness of character and detail keeps you involved. Ultimately, this is a book I will never forget, largely because it gave me the chance to view the world through the eyes of of another human being, which to me is truly the \\"heart of the matter.\\"	2004-08-20

(The first is \\"10 AO LSATS\\", followed by \\"10 More AO LSATs\\" and now this, \\"10 Next AO LSATs.\\"). All three books contain offcially released, actual LSATs. However, if only buying one, I would say that this is the best choice. The tests are newer; moreover, it seems to me that the \\"games and \\"logic\\" sections of the current LSAT, though ostensibly the same as when first introduced in 1994, have been made slightly easier. If you just read the first book, you may be needlessly scared and discouraged. With this book and to a lesser extent the second book, you will at least not have unjustified anxiety. This is still a TOUGH test, but but no longer quite the nightmare it was back in the mid 90s.	2004-08-20

The explanations of many of the so-called &quot;correct&quot; answers on the practice tests are illogical or wrong. This is particularly notable in the reading and and argumention sections. The Essay section gives smart tips and and is fully adequate, given how little weight schools put on it. I found the games section the strongest part of the book, both the text and the practice test questions.<br />To maximize your score, You would be far better served by practicing on the official LSATs realeasesd by ETS and sold as 10 More Actual, Official LSAT Preptests ISBN: 0942639804.

The &quot;Rosettes&quot; really are special recordings, and the narrative descriptions are uncannily dead- on. However, it is a big book, and one can waste a lot of time hunting down a particular recording if turns out not to be classified where you guessed it should/would be. (Sometimes, I know a recording is there because I came across it once, but still I can't find it again.) If ever there were a candidate for a searchable CD-ROM rom text, this is it. Still, if you buy a lot of CDs, this is indispensable.	2002-12-15
