It starts out with the premise tht the best laid plans will never succeed without someone actually making sure it's done. In they're opinion, the CEO must be the one to do it. An interesting premise and one worth exploring. Unfortunately, this book never delivered. Instead, it is packed with stories and reminiscences about how great some people are and why isn't everyone that way. It uses specific genralities to stay that it's important to be honest and realistic in the business world. <BR>Duh! There's nothing new in it, and especially nothing for those mid-level people who want to succeed. <BR>Other books are much better.	2002-09-26

I was taught and taught others the LINE system while in service and even then, i knew it was ineffective. The moves, punches, countermoves and holds are impractical and difficult to execute in combat. I, along with several others, while going along with the manual, finally boiled the system down to a dozen techniques and drilled with them. The Marines discontinued this system because of the same reasons that I mentioned. <BR>DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.	2002-09-24

It offers three levels of training, all basically the same format but with different intensity levels. <BR>I have used this book several times over the last 2 years and enjoy the workouts. I break up the daily routines into 3 segments-the calisthetic part in the morning, the weights in the afternoon and the ad work in the evening. On running days, a similar pattern-running in the morning, weights at lunch and ab work in the evening. The routines don't take long that way but adds to fat-burning and muscle-building without exhaustion.<BR>There are some negative points: they show exercises that they don't use and suggest exercises that they don't show. <BR>But overall, I recommend this book to everyone who wants to get in shape without joining a gym.	2002-09-15

Too often, I see people doing too many exercises incorrectly for the wrong reasons. This book can help solve this problem. <BR>Clearly and artistically, Delavier goes through exercises for every body part, describing the execution of movement, variations, muscle functions and draws the muscles used with different colors representing the level of tension each muscle undergoes. <BR>The drawings are beautiful and informative, a true blending of art and science. <BR>Instead of taking somebody's word about a particular exercise, get this book and see for yourself what works.	2002-09-02

This book, the 2nd in the ColdFire trilogy, has Damien, Tarrant, Hesseth and a new character, Jenesey a young girl who escapes a massacre, traveling in the eastern continent of Erna to do battle with the Undying Prince, a man who controls both humans and rakhs from his stronghold in the Black Lands. The Undying Prince plans to invade the northern part of the continent and has being laying plans with spies and the Matrias, female rakhs who are disguised as humans who lead the Church of the north. <BR>After a long journey fraught with perils and a battle in the Wasting during which Hesseth dies, Damien, Tarrant and Jenesay reach the Undying Prince's lair only to have Tarrant betray the others to the Prince. The betrayal is a false one and Damien tries to kill the Prince but fails. Jenesey succeeds in killing the Prince and herself. Damien and Tarrant leae the Black Lands and travel north where they find the human populace engaged in a campaign of hysterical extermination against the rakh invaders. <BR>It turns out that the Undying Prince isn't the real danger but Calesta, an Iezu demon who thrives on pain and suffering, is. Calesta wants to turn the fae against humans and rakh alike to create an unending warfare. <BR>This book lacks the level of violence tht the 1st had but in makes up for it in character development and a deepening relationship between Damien and Tarrant. Damien learns that his Church may be corrupted, not only by rakh imposters, but even well-meaning humans who twist their faith to coincide with their hatreds rather than the other way around. Tarrant learns that his biggest experiment, the Chruch and God, may actually be working. Twice in the book, an unknown force intervenes, a force that bothe Damien and Tarrant call God. If so, then Tarrant is doubly damned for he is separated from God by his curse and his pride. <BR>This development is the crux of the book, the other actions are merely props to the discovery of God. If the fae can bring demons to life, why can't the prayers and faith of millions bring God to life, too? An interesting idea that will be developed in the 3rd book. <BR>Philosophy and religious themes overshadow the action plot, a predictable and mediocre effort. Again, Friedman takes a lot of words to painstakingly describe every rock, tree, flower, animal, human, rakh and their costumes. Intellectually, the book is better than the 1st as the characters mature. <BR>I look forward to the final book.	2002-08-08

Earth colonists have established a primitive society on a living planet that can read thoughts, wishes, dreams and especially fears and translate them into reality. A place where certain people, faeborn, and socerers fight to control the fae. A place where an evil grows, an evil that comsumes a victim's mind and memories, leaving them an empty husk. A place where Gerrald Tarrant, NeoCount and psycho-vampire must join forces with a priest to save the world. <BR>Tarrant was originally the Prophet of the Church, peaching that together, humans cound control the world. Then the Church turns against him and he, for fear of death, sacrifices his family and becomes the antithesis of good, light, warmth. <BR>Damien Vryce, a priest/socerer/Healer/defender of the Faith, must rely on Tarrant to save the woman he loves and his Church. With the aid of a native aborigine rakh, Hesseret, they travel to the Forbibben Lands to confront the Evil. Triumphant at last, they realize that the evil they destroyed is not the source but a symptom. And so the stage is set for the 2nd book.<BR>As the Emperor Leopold said the Mozart\\" an enjoyable effort but it has too many words.\\" This is how I feel about this book. Friedman spends an inordinate amount of time trying to describe the lands, cities and everything else in such detail that it detracts from the storyline. The action is predictable as are the characters. It starts off slow but picks up about half-way. It could be simply me but a few terse desriptions would add more to the book than these elaborate ones. Personal preference. I read it at the beach at a leisurely pace with no compunction not to put it down. Good summer reading.	2002-08-06

Through detailed interviews with participants and survivors, the author draws a clear picture of events that pulls the reader in to become a part of the story.<BR>After the Bataan Death March, POWs were sent to a central prision where conditions were deplorable. To the Japanese, the POWs were no longer soldiers or even men and therefore did not deserve proper treatment. The POWs lived in squalor and deprivation for months, malnourished and mistreated. Thousands died from disease, starvation and mistreatment. <BR>But the survivors managed to form a semi-living society with order, discipline and a semblance of sanity. It is truly a testament to the human spirit that these men were able to accomplish what they did for 3 years. <BR>THe Rangers, led by Col. Mucci, were a new breed of soldiers, trained in a different type of war (which has become the way of war in modern times.) They risked their lives to rescue these unknown POWs. Their ordeal is heroic and inspiring. <BR>Lee once said that it is good that war is so terrible else we should grow too fond of it. War brings out the worst and best in people. THis book shows examples of both. Yet it is not condemning or racist in the descriptions of the Japanese. It really was a clash of cultures in which no compromise could exist. It is told in a straightforward, clear manner that makes reading it enjoyable and moving.	2002-07-12

It's a straight, clear program that focuses on getting in shape, primarily to attract women.It has different levels of intensity for the various exercises and sections for every body part. It reviews nutrition and other aspects of fitness, with plenty of recipes and humor.<BR>It offers a 12 week program of exercise and diet designed to get a man in shape. If you follow it, it will be in better shape than when you started. It's that simple. <BR>On the negative side, the program focuses on looking in shape. I believe in functional fitness, defined as being able to do what is necessary in different situations. I had a friend follow this program and while he looked in shape, he couldn't run 3 miles in less than 25 mins. nor swim, nor do 15 pullups or various other tests that I devised. <BR>This book is good if you want to be \\"eye candy,\\" but if you want to be physically ready for anything, there are better books.	2002-07-11

If that wasn't enough, she meets a French vampire, Jean-Claude and starts to fall for him. The series goes downhill from there. <BR>At first, the series is humorous, horrific, but tongue-in-cheek. THe action is good and Anita is a tough cookie. But as the series progresses, the plot focuses more on the relationships between the various characters and less on alternative realities. The action becomes more gruesome and less humorous while the sex scenes are more graphic. I think the writer lost her way and was given bad advice or maybe she was just letting her fantasies get the best of her. <BR>I stopped reading them after the 5th book. It just got boring.	2002-07-10

It is still a classic! <BR>THe plot is unusual-Grahme is a scholar/tactician assigned to a force fighting a guerilla war on one of the dozen colony worlds. Earth is divided into the Alliance/Coalition camps who fight their wars through these colonies. Grahme has some very unique ideas about fighting wars and, through deception and ruse, puts into into action and wins the war. Grahme's foil is Dow Castries, an Earth politician bent on world(s) domination. Grahme believes the new worlds should be free of Earth and chooses the Dorsai as his weapon. Grahme designs a novel training/strategy/tactics regime for the Dorsai to transform themselves into the best mercenaries in the universe. Using his Dorsai, Grahme wins several important successes that prompt Dow to unite the Earth into an all-out war. Grahme defeats Dow and paves the way for the new world's freedom.<BR>The most interesting part of the story is not the military action-like most military amateurs Dickson is fighting the last war (Vietnam)- but Grahme's grasp and control of historical forces and his ability to manipulate people into his scheme, without their knowing it. It's a masterful attempt at persuasion and manipulation which sets in motion the novel's sequels.<BR>Dickson, like his couterpart Grahme, has created an universe in which he controls everything according to a set scheme. <BR>I'm just glad it's only fiction and that there's not really some super-powerful all-controlling force at work manipulating me and everyone else for its own designs.

I was a little disappointed, though. <BR>While the chapters are easy to read and clearly delimited, I thought they treated each topic relatively superficially. <br />The chapter on calisthetics was almost spartan in its variery and descriptions. Likewise weith the weight lifting, swimming and running chapters. <BR>It did a good job of describing how the various missions done by SEALS require different physical activities and what training and exercises to do to prepare for them. <BR>It had a brief overview of supplements and the effectiveness but nothing new. <BR>The workout routines were hardly original or impressive. Stew's book is better in that area.<BR>I think this book is geared towards a SEAL in active service with little time for training. <BR>I gave my copy to a student who wants to be a SEAL.

Filled with exciting chases, action and suspense, I couldn't put this book down.<BR>It starts with the conquest of the Inka empire and the search for a mystical statue revered by the Inkas. Fast forward to 1999 and a break-in at a top-secret lab to steal the ultimate Doomsday device. Enter a professor of Ancient languages to translate a manuscript detailing the location of the mystical statue, now known to be of an extra-terrestial element needed to fuel the Doomsday device.<BR>The chase is on with the Army trying to recover the statue before the Navy. It seems that COngress is considering eliminating one military service, probably the Army but if the army had the Doomsday device and the trigger, then they would survive.<BR>Throw in a ruthless Nazi power who wants to destabilize the world economy by blackmail. <BR>Throw in domestic terrorists who simply want to destroy the world.<BR>THrow in an ancient beast, the rapa, who can defeat caimans in a fight.<BR>Add those ingredients together and you have an excellent, edge-of-your-seat read for the beach or backyard.<br />It does, however, stretch the credibility to suggest that a professor can overcome trained soldiers and psycho-terrorists, perform incredible feats of physical prowess and never lose his hat. A couple of scenes remind me of Star Wars and Indiana Jones a little too much for coincidence. The book is a little long, too. It should have ended after the 4th machination. <br />Other than those minor quibbles, the book is great. I await his next book eagerly.	2002-03-26

I was not disappointed. The plot is straight forward and the action fast-paced. The characters are standard without too much depth to them but enjoyable.<br />The use of disparate bits of info, like rongorongo, a real undecipherable language found in Micronesia, the Devel Sea, a region of the pacific similar to the Bermuda Triangle and the mysterious megalithic buildings scattered throughout Micronesia and the legend of MU is interesting. Rollins weaves them together into an very enjoyable, entertaining book. <br />But why does every modern hero have to be a ex-Seal?

It's filled with historical anecdotes from which, the author tries to extrapolate \\"laws\\" of power, defined as getting people to do what you want. <BR>It's fun to read but simplistic in ingoring motivational theory or moral suasion. <BR>It is designed for those who think they have to wheel and deal their way to the top by fooling others.

THis book is for everyone who wants to get into the bes shape of their lives. I have owned this book for years and still use it during the spring and summer months. <BR>But, be warned, the routines take a long time. I divide them into daily segments and expand the weekly format into 2 or 3 weeks. Increase the reps, laps and distances slowly. Instead of running 3 miles during one week then 4 miles the next, try 3 miles, then 3.5 miles while keeping the other routines as the previous week. THe same goes with swimming. <BR>I stayed on a week routine until I can do everything I am suppose to before moving to the next week. This allows my body to adapt and improves my performance. <BR>Another tip is to cycle.

Each componemt is examined and explained. When combined they produce a well-rounded training program, focusing on time. <BR>By using time, a person won't spend 1 hour training when 30 minutes will do. By using different components, a person receives a better overall fitness program while preventing burnout and lessening the chance for injury. <BR>It sems strange to train for 15 minutes then stop but the intensity is greater so it balances out.

The workouts were difficult to follow.<BR>His 1st book was terrific. This one isn't.	2001-12-13
