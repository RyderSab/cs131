Each cartoon combines great artwork with biting comment.    Much of the material covered covers \\"W\\", Cheney and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The artist really hits the mark (with \\"W\\" there is a lot of scope).  It would be hard to pick a favorite from this collection.  The drunken America West pilots would have to be my pick from the non \\"W\\" material.    Editorial cartoons can have a limited shelf life, by nature they are a snapshot in time, encapsulating humor and comment.  Only the very best can outlast the immediacy of their subject matter. There are numerous cartoons in this superb collection that should stand the test of time.	2005-10-05

This book covers, in detail, the existing use of RF technology to violate consumer privacy.  RF chips are small and innocuous. RF chips can easily be seen as a benign technology if used appropriately (for example to reduce shoplifting by enhancing loss protection capabilities of retail stores and improved stock management).    The authors have identified numerous examples of multinational companies misusing RF chip technology.    The research behind this book appears both thorough and comprehensive. The use of statements lifted from patents really helps the authors make their case that these chips are likely to be put to use in ways the majority of us would find disturbing if not repugnant.     Negatives: the style of writing is very sensationalist.  The mix of editorial comment and research lessons the impact of some of the material presented.  The material sometimes lacks context: almost any technology can be abused.  Also, in some instances loss of privacy may be a reasonable trade off for improved service/protection.      Also, RF Chips are not a unique risk (add data mining, \\"smart\\" chips and even car electronics - e.g. the chip that operates airbags,in some models, will record the impact speed of an accident).    The book draws on examples from around the World.  US consumers have more to worry about than Canada, Australia and Europe where there is at least some protection from data protection legislation. US Privacy legislation lags behind (could this possibly be the result of lobbying by corporate political action committees?).    The bottom line is that the authors are right to raise a very loud warning to act on misuse of this technology, before it is too late.	2005-09-30

Applying martial arts techniques to answering difficult questions?  The concept conjured up thoughts of a drill sergeant yelling answers in a command voice. My skepticism was quickly put to rest. <br /> <br />The author provides a methodical approach to dealing with difficult questions.  The suggested method is practical, systematic and easy to follow.  However, to effectively apply it will take practice.  It does draw on martial art techniques and precepts - provide a measured response to address the issue / question in hand. <br /> <br />The suggested approach will allow the reader to apply rhetorical analysis to any question, and frame a credible response that is more likely to be positive.  Topics covered include active listening and actually addressing the question raised.  Without being evasive or defensive. <br /> <br />Most of the examples come from the field of Politics.  Some are drawn from senior executive briefings (e.g. briefing market analysts for an IPO). <br /> <br />Will this book improve the average person's presentation skills? The examples are from the most aggressive debating arena (political debate), however, they can be applied anywhere. <br /> <br />There is a companion DVD to this book - it is well worth obtaining.  It superbly illustrates common pitfalls and best practice. <br /> <br />The two resources, taken together, are a very valuable resource for anyone who has to face tough questioning as part of their career. <br /> <br />	2005-09-05

For figures that until their death lived such illusive and insignificant lives the biographies are superbly detailed and comprehensive.<br /><br />The style of writing is informative and generally fair and balanced given the nature of the subjects.  It is probably the clearest account of the events leading to 9/11 that has been written.<br /><br />Two minor criticisms:  Every major religion has its share of extremists. Islam is no exception.  The book implies a more general malaise than is probably deserved.  All major religions have their high and low points: prior to the renaissance, Arabic scholars preserved much of previous eastern and western philosophy, while making significant advances in algebra, medicine and navigation.<br /><br />The description of the countries and places in which much of the plotting occurs sometimes lacks context (but not accuracy).  E.g., although the authors' description of Cairo is superb, but as far as cities go, it surpasses most of the developing world, both for safety and quality of life.  Also, to state that German bureaucracy conducted minimal monitoring of Islamic extremists is true; but at the time the US wasn't doing such a great job itself.<br /><br />Overall this is a superbly written book that is very readable.  It appears to be very well researched and is an excellent set of biographies.	2005-05-13

The PC Toys projects are relatively easy to implement and spoon feed the reader all the material needed to complete the toys.    I think this is an excellent book.  I'm very comfortable with software and coding, but not that great with electronics.    This book is more ambitious, provides good road maps for the different project areas, but the book is written with the intent of the reader branching out and developing their own solution.  My interests are X-10 and Wireless based projects.    The companion website provides alot of source code that can be tweeked, or rewritten for your own particular project.    Negatives: not for beginers, could be insufficient for \\"experts\\".  These statement may be contrary, but instructions lack detail for a complete novice.  At the same time, if you have a particular interest in a given area, this book might not be providing you with anything new.    Check out the contents before buying to ensure your going to get a book that gives you the amount of detail you need.  A look at the contents page and a quick skim should help decide if it is right for you.    If you liked PC toys, could manage the projects and want something more challenging the chances are you'll like this book.  I think it's an excellent source of inspiration for projects.	2005-05-03

The text covers the historical use of herbs and casts a far wider net than the Judean / Christian bible. Other traditions and sources are considered such as Celtic, Greek and Roman (albeit the emphasis is definitely biblical).<br /><br />The book makes fascinating reading and works well in numerous areas. Description of the origin, naming and early use of herbs is very interesting. Plant use, propagation techniques and harvesting are all well described.<br /><br />There are a few very nice color plates but illustrations are not a strong point of this well written book. There are some nice suggestions for biblical herb gardens that are open to the public.<br /><br />I'm not a botanist and don't have much interest in the bible; but I am fascinated by herbs (suppose the productive use of plants in general) - I really enjoyed this book.	2005-04-30

This isn't a bad book, but it nowhere near justifies the cover price.  There just isn't the information within to justify the cost of the book. <br /> <br />After making the mistake of buying this book I went back and looked at some of the reviews.  It is interesting to note the number of duplicates.  Further, many of the reviewers have reviewed only this book.  But wait; one of the reviewers has chosen to write a (negative) review of antother outsourcing text. Must be the suspicious auditor in me. <br /> <br />Leaving aside the accuracy or intent of any reviews, my primary complaint with this text is the absence of any real coverage of risk (regional, IT, infrastructure........).

What sets this book apart is providing a sound description of the chemical properties of plants together with the spiritual context in which they are used.<br /><br />It isn't packed with biochemical formulae, but at the same time has enough information on active ingredients to provide a starting point for understanding and further research (if desired).  For those interested in biochemical properties of plants CRC Press publish a range of comprehensive but expensive guides.<br /><br />The author also provides a cultural context, describing how the plants are/were used by societies both past and present during religious rights.  Folklore is also very well covered (my main interest with this book - as an aside there is little of culinary interest within text).<br /><br />The pictures of plants (and people) are superb.  There are also some fascinating diagrams (world map showing indigenous hallucinogens), and a pictures showing illustrating the role of hallucinogens on aboriginal and western art.<br /><br />The writing style makes this work much more accessible and enjoyable to read than other texts. The text is supported by excellent illustrations.  Plants of the Gods is in a class of it's own.	2005-04-28

The book doesn't does not have a botanical key to support identification of more unusual specimens (I don't miss this, others may).    One possible source of disappointment: this book does not always provide many examples within individual varieties.  For example, there are hundreds of thyme varieties; this book covers off on half a dozen or so.  Some readers may want a more specific text.

This book encourages the rational and logical analysis of everyday problems and issues.    I do not agree with every analysis the authors put forward.  For example, the authors do prove a correlation between abortion and decreasing crime (Roe v. Wade).  They do not, however, prove an actual (quantifiable) relationship - it could/may be; but the jump is too great based on the information provided in the book.  Other examples are clear cut: the incentive for realtors to opt for a quick sale rather than maximizing sale price is made.    The book is exciting to read.  It encourages an analytical approach to problem solving while encouraging creativity of thought.  This is a rare combination.  Likely to be of value to anyone who has to adopt an analytical approach in their work.	2005-04-17

At first it was interesting, however it does get very repetitive.  The book is written in an intimate style that encourages the reader to be empathetic; the authoress has been very candid.  However the trials and tribulations of her life are really no more challenging than that faced by many ordinary people.  Will this book help or inspire others?  Possibly; it didn't do much for me.    While her actions during the Vietnam War were offensive, in particular with respect to POWs, ongoing vilification of one individual serves no useful purpose.  It's good to have people who think and act contrary to the mainstream, even if their message is ill conceived and poorly delivered.    I think the book is written with good intent, it's candid and it isn't as self serving as some of the reviews suggest.  At the same time there are many better books.  Towards the end it held the same level of interest as reading an out of date train timetable. My rating: Two Stars + One for the needless vilification.	2005-04-15

That's why it gests five stars - there is nothing that innovative though. I am a systems auditor - these are the sort of things that make going to work entertaining. <br /> <br />Some of the suggestions are a very quick way to get into trouble - PC anywhere in particular is a high risk product in it's own right - if the security settings are scrwed up.  Who is monitoring your network traffic?  Do you want them to know what's on your home PC?

Books	5	32	34	N	Y	Worth Trying .......	First things first, this book was great fun to read.  The author writes with passion on her subject and clearly has a great love of this topic.  It really does shine through.  The description of different herbs is workman like and covers off on all the kitchen herbs in everyday use.<br /><br />The book is punctuated by some interesting recipes.  Those that I have tried I like.<br /><br />Now getting down in the dirt: lasagna gardening is a combination of using composted materials coupled with a layer of news papers between the soil and the compost to eliminate weeds.  Preparing rich compost from kitchen waste is something I do already, the use of newspaper as a weed suppressant is something I would never of thought of (very logical though).  I love the thought of minimal work.<br /><br />In general herbs can do very well in dry sandy soil and will tolerate poor conditions.  My main problems are countering winter cold.<br /><br />The technique outlined should be great for raised bed and limited space gardening.  I plan to try out the technique on a small area, for growing annual herbs.

To start with, a back ground in electronic engineering.  If you don't have practical real world (or at least laboratory experience), you could get yourself, or worse, someone else, killed.  <br /> <br />I wouldn't suggest this as a source book for high school science projects; it's as likely to get you a term of 5 - 10 in a state run facility (not college) as an A grade.  Given the current climate, using a high power laser pointer could land you in a fair bit of trouble (the book does point this out).  This is also one of the better documented projects. <br /> <br />The other factors that the book does not consider are: <br />* Budget.   These are not low cost projects. <br />* Time.  Plan on doing research outside this book. <br /> <br />From the 28, there is one project I plan to try.  Read the contents page before buying - unless there is at least one project you really want to do (and sink time and money into).  I would pass.  Some of the plans are more like overviews.	2005-04-06

The authors do a good job of explaining how to invest in gold and how to put a portfolio together (from coins to mining stock). <br />Following the advice and investing all your funds into gold and a limited number of stocks could be self destructive though. <br /> <br />However, as the authors point out, the Government has confiscated gold before - and could again.  If things get as bad as they suggest Governments could nationalize mines ........ <br /> <br />If the authors are on target with their predictions, investing now in an assault rifle, a cabin in the woods and alot of tinned food would make a better investment than gold.  <br /> <br />Gold could very well make a great investment given a sliding dollar; the argument that the dollar will collapse completely is taken to an absolute extreme (the Dollar Crisis, Causes Consequence Cures, covers the same ground more convincingly). <br /> <br />Useful book - worth considering as part of your personal investment strategy.  However, I wouldn't plan my portfolio around the authors advice alone - having too great a dependance on any one asset class can be bad.  Advice on how to invest in gold (practicalities)is very good though.	2005-02-24

At some point we will all interact with sociopaths.  What the book drives home is that their condition may impact the lives of the other 96% more than the sociopaths themselves. <br /> <br />Reading the composite descriptions I can clearly identify one individual who fitted the composite description so clearly it could have been written for her.

However, I also want the Government to protect me from large corporations and individuals who might store information on me for no good reason and abuse information they hold.  <br /> <br />The book documents we are getting the surveillance to \\"protect us\\".  It is beyond question this is open to abuse.  We should have privacy rights, supported by legislation to counter abuse. <br /> <br />Great book, don't agree with all conclusions but it makes a sound case and points are well argued.	2005-02-17

Like most small investors my assets are split between bonds, stock and realestate.      I have never considered commodities, as the market research required is too involved and I believed the risks to be too high.  This book explains the rationale for investing in commodities very well - and the predictions provide a sound justification.      I'm very uncertain of the mechanics though.  Also, unless you understand what drives supply and demand for a given commodity it's a gamble not an investment (like any other \\"investment\\" where you don't undertand the product).    From reading this book my next steps are more research and most likely investing in a fund (the authors intent?).  I don't kow whether commodities are the worlds best market, I won't be betting my shirt, but certainly a good way to diversify given the all too real possibility of a bear/flat market and sliding dollar.    Far from complete coverage, but well worth reading.	2005-02-15

Even in Spain, Ireland and Italy where the Catholic Church has had significant impact, or the UK, where Church and Government is linked, politics are far more secular (as increasingly is the case throughout Europe).     This book helps demystify (to an outsider) the current role of religion in the US; during the 2004 election it did appear the Republican Party had a monopoly on religious issues. As someone used to secular politics this book helps explain the influence of religion in a country where church and state are supposedly separate.......	2005-02-12

The concepts outlined apply just as well to non ebay sites.  This book is non technical and contains advice that can be easily applied.  Some of the suggestions are \\"free\\" (except time, e.g. participating in forums to build traffic), others a direct cost e.g. froogle ads.  This information is of value beyond ebay. <br /> <br />The advice on using ebay store fronts as your business web site is interesting, as is the comment an external web site may not be required / wont pay for itself.  I am interested in affiliate selling, and have been experimenting, my web address is: <br />[...] (even given the obscure address the site pays). <br /> <br />For a book geared towards driving traffic to your sight, it's a pity not to include a section (see [...] or the Amazon affiliate scheme for a few ideas).

It has the look and feal of a modern school textbook and is very easy to follow.  The illustrations and screen shots are great. <br /> <br />The focus of the book is on presentation of listings (it is about HTML!).  Topics covered include setting up photos, clipping images, and the use of video/animation and sound.  From a personal perspective the latter two are annoying in most instances. <br /> <br />Following the book will result in well presented listings.  Advice on actual content (wording)is limited.  Much of the content is covered off in ebay hacks, albiet lacking the same level of illustration. <br /> <br />If you are familiar with HTML the book won't give you anything new.  Cover price of $19.95 may make it slow to get your money back off this book. There are more useful books (driving ebay traffic, ebay hacks).  <br /> <br />I'm not great with HTML but I don't think it will be much better as a result of this book (although ebay stores are covered it does not detail how to structure companion sites). <br /> <br />Example from my homepage: <br />[...] <br /> <br />If you have no HTML experience, don't like getting into technical details and want a very user friendly guide, this book is a very soft introduction.	2005-02-01

Books	5	96	136	N	N	Revisionist History - Where It's Needed	I have read a couple of revisionist books written to cash in on current events (Melkin's piece on internment and France our Oldest Enemey.  This book is excellent, it shares a contravercial title, there any similarity ends (it is well worth looking beyond it's title).    To claim this book is one sided neglects the outright bias that is present in most teaching of history within the US.  I was educated in England and appalled at the superficial coverage US history receives within the US school system (not to say the same PC slant isn't present in the UK now - it's probably worse).  Coverage is more like a liberal apology than coverage of events.    The book adopts the \\"following the money approach\\" to analyzing who profited most from slavery - the case that much of the wealth went to the North is well made.  It also points out slavery was not new to Africa, and was practiced by Africans on their own people without outside intervention.  The case is also well made that the North, and Lincoln held racist views.  The lot of blacks in the Northern states was precarious (e.g. draft riot lynchings in NY City).    The authors do not make any case in favour of slavery - their consistent line is the practice is vile.    The fact that many blacks served, assisted and provided material support to the war on both sides is beyond refute.  Native Americans also served with distinction on both sides during the civil war (including one Brig. Gen on Grant's Staff) - this material does less for the authors case (their choice was more governed by tribal location).    The book has a few flaws, it does repeat itself.  Arguing that conditions for US POWs do not amount to war crimes (it does even if the North had similar low standards - two wrongs dont make a right) and probably worse, forgetting glossing over atrocities of the South.  The style is a little journalistic.    Great book that dispels some myths, and brings others into question.  Makes the reader realize why most confederatesoldiers fought so well.  Despite the fact that more than 90% held no slaves.	2004-12-30

The book is interesting and timely - given the potential for overstretch of traditional resources the potential for the private sector could be even higher than present. <br /> <br />The one possible negative comment that could be made against this book is the implication that private military forces are something new e.g. East India Company.	2004-12-09

Like all guides of this sort, it can't cover everything.  If you have a particular interest in a specific field then this book will not work for you (e.g. if you collect Silver E.P. from the 30's this book covers off on one manufacturer well).  If you want a general price guide, can draw inferences from items of a similar age, quality, style and market this book helps. <br /> <br />In both style and content it is similar to Miller's: Antiques Price Guide 2005 by Elizabeth Norfolk.  I think Norfolk's book has a definate edge; although it is a little more expensive. <br /> <br />Neither book is a \\"how to appraise\\" guide - they don't claim to be.

I had been trying to open an old S&L moneybox for some time - the lock mechanism is \\"simple\\" per this book. Curiosity can be frustrating. I didn't want to spend any money on tools for a one off project (I ended up doing this and bought another book). The intellectual satisfaction was worth it.  I'm interested in antiques so may get some payback for learning in the future. (I can now also open simple padlocks, and furniture locks, with an improvised tool in fairly quick time.) <br /> <br />The information on getting into a locked car is easy to follow; I knew some of this before buying the book but the process will be easier in future. The stuff on handcuffs also appears straightforward - if you use them for business or pleasure - I don't - this could be worth reading. <br /> <br />This is a practical book but hard work and requires practice. Worth reading if you have a real interest in locks and will practice. Not for beginers; I bought this book first then came back to it.	2004-12-08

(For Dummies Series)	Books	5	40	42	N	Y	Excellent Book Learnt Stuff I Can Apply to Buying / Selling	This book is very useful. The best coverage for me: <br /> <br />- ebay scams (in particular bid rigging - shilling) <br />- interpretation of feedback (in particular assessing the likely risk to you). <br />- auction timing <br />- presenting information <br />- legitimate use of multiple IDs <br /> <br />The information on sourcing is more up for debate.  Some of the comments are overstated (e.g. bargains hard to find at yard sells). In general sellers are more knowledgeable, as they are on ebay.  However, many people selling through ebay or garage sells are doing so to rid themselves of items.  There are some people who run \\"weekly\\" sells that sacrifice volume for profit.  The author is spot on in his comments about dumpster diving though (if anything legal, health and security risks are understated in the current climate). <br /> <br />Like the ebay hacks book, some of the information wont be new to most ebayer's.  It is mostly original and well worth reading.  It's not very technical in style and should be of benefit to new ebayers and old hands.   <br /> <br />I learnt alot. This book should pay for itself, this is the best test, for me, of any eBay book.	2004-11-23

This is the most comprehensive account of artillery during the Napoleonic wars I think you could hope to read (if anyone has an alternate please do review and add reference).  It is a lucid and at times exciting account of the use of artillery.  I think it has covered every major action of the period including some I hadn't heard of. <br /> <br />Not only does the book cover the engagements well, it also provides great technical details - even down to sample artillery tables from the period.  Lavish illustrations are provided with descriptions of contemporary tools. <br /> <br />There are plenty of books on Cavalry and Infantry for this period, but their scope is far less ambitious than this work. Often by battle, country, tactical and strategic etc. The scope of this work is very ambitious, every aspect of an entire combat arm for multiple countries during a key period of history - the author has produced a great book. <br />	2004-10-29

This book makes the case for having a CI function within a company very well.  It also outlines major CI approaches used and shows how CI is being used in different markets by a broad range of practitioners.  The interviews are very enlightening, and many of the techniques can be used by other disciplines.  My interest is using CI methods and processes to keep up to date with technology risks and opportunities.  This book helps.  The accounts of the interviews are great. <br /> <br />The one thing that was very irritating about this book: to say that \\"intelligence operations\\" are new to companies.  CI may be a new discipline, but using intelligence methods in business is not new (J P Morgan and the other industrial magnates of his time would be turning in their graves!  They used intelligence operations in the markets that would make the CIA blush).  Within the US, industrial espionage probably has a longer history than military intelligence.

It's a great summation. <br /> <br />The book contantly alludes to previous bubbles, Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation by Edward Chancellor does a far better job, and is well worth reading in conjunction with this book. <br /> <br />There are a few further assumptions that make the predictions in this book far from certain: <br /> <br />For a theory that depends on demographics there is little consideration of the impact of immigration and population flows on average age.  This is a variable that will be affected by both internal factors such as government policy and events external to America.  America will have to slip even further than Harry suggets it might to deter potential immigrants. <br /> <br />The analogies drawn between current technology development/acceptance and the automobile industry in the 1920's may not hold. Harry appears to lump all technology developments into one \\"bubble\\", when we should be looking at multiple, if related industries. Will Grid Computing, M-Commerce, Biotech and Web 2 all fit the same product lifecycle? <br /> <br />As an aside, annoyingly the author refers to the first computer in 1946 - Prof Allen Turing actually produced a computer in 42, as part of the Ultra project to crack Enigma encryption.  <br /> <br />What makes this a good book is that even if we can't predict the future, we shouldn't be surprised by it.  The author may be far off actual events - he does provide valuable insights into taking advantage of the market and not following the rear of a bubble.  I'm not planning to take the predictions as gospel but it highlights the need for constantly reviewing asset allocation.	2004-10-16

Watch the history or discovery channel on any given week and there is a fair chance you will watch an account of the wonder weapons that Germany nearly built.  This book helps shatter the myth that Germany was more advanced.      It's coverage is broad, as such, if you want an exhausitve account of V2 production, Luftwaffe high altitude experimentation on concentration camp inmates or the merits of the tiger tank against the Sherman M4 you will find another book more helpful.    This book does give:  - an account of early 20th Century Science, as background and context.  Racial theory, the study of skull shapes and sterilization of the \\"inferior\\" were not confined to Germany.  - the results of the exclusion/persecution of Jewish scholars and the benefit to the US and the allies.  - the evil of Nazi Science (slave labour, murder).  - the moral dilemas faced by scientists.  - the economic waste of Nazi Weapons programs e.g. V1 and V2.  Although techically superb, the costs outwayed the benefits.  - conflicting groups failing to cooperate (SS, Luftwaffe, Army and Navy competing with similar projects.)  - following \\"stupid\\" concepts on the whim of a leader.    To be fair, the last to failings were/are shared by many countries, but not to the same extreme.    The impact of Nazi science on the remainder of the 20th century is also assessed.  For example, the US space program and the willingness of the Allies to hire Nazi Scientists.    The book places the actual (and very real achievements) of Nazi science in the context of evil and ineffective use.  Good book, very broad coverage.  Raises numerous issues - a great start for further thought and study.  Also, the book helps to put many of the \\"what if ....\\" books and TV shows in their true context (entertaining speculation).	2004-10-04

This book needs updating.  What it doesn't cover could cost you money.    The advice concerning auctioneers is spot on.  For an eye-opening account of what two of the biggest auction houses got up to, read: The Art of the Steal: Inside the Sotheby's-Christie's Auction House Scandal, by Christopher Mason.      Most auctioneers are honest.  However, auctioneer's are like Realtors - they are effectively paid on a commission basis - it is not in their interest to hold out for the best price for a consumer; achieving volume and an \\"acceptable\\" sale price is better than making no sale (of course an auctioneer, like a Realtor, would not stiff the seller to the point where they would loose credibility / repeat business).  In your area, you may find auctioneers who sell both real estate and antiques.  If you need convincing of this incentive, read: Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything by Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner. Or, just look at the basis the auctioneer is rewarded.      If you follow the advice in the book for selling venues (and sourcing)and do not consider web sales you will act as a source of cheap stock for everyone else!  Example: Yard sell, maximum viewers (100's), antique fair (1000's), eBay/Amazon (millions).  I bought an item for 50c at a yard sell and sold for $15 on eBay.    I would agree with everything the other reviewers have said about this book.  It contains great advice.  Negotiating advice is superb. I would also add that the outlines of possible home based antique businesses provide additional possibilities I hadn't even thought of.     If you are seeking to make money from antiques DO BUY this book, it has valuable advice and is well worth the price.  Just make sure you supplement your reading with some basic internet selling advice, either from books (The Tech TV eBay selling or How to do everything with your business on eBay are good starting points), or read the free instructions on eBay and Amazon.    On line auctions aren't always the best bet, but they are a tool that can be utilised to make money from antiques.  Great book but does need updating.	2004-09-25

In addition to being a great account of an historical incident from the early C17, this book lays a foundation for understanding English history into the 20th Century.    The first chapters deal with the succession of James IV of Scotland to the English crown (the start of union between England and Scotland), and how this was engineered to avoid a catholic monarch.  The book clearly articulates how the rights of the Roman Catholic minority were suppressed (Fraser's other books, recounting the lives of Mary and Elizabeth put this in context.  Catholic suppression of Protestants under Mary was far more brutal and resulted in more executions).    The policy of religious intolerance resulted in the emergence of a complex terrorist plot.  The book leaves a fascinating question unresolved - was the plot portrayed from within?    The end of the plotters is recounted in gruesome detail, from their initial interrogation (the impact of torture on Guy Fawkes is clearly evidenced by the degeneration of his flowing signature to a mere scrawl) to ritual execution.    This text also provides an excellent backdrop to understanding some of the events that lead to the English Civil war.  Further suppression of religion (this time the Puritans, who resented any hint of a return to catholic practices (the pilgrim farthers immigrated to America), and ongoing resentment of the Catholic faith in England.    The actions of the plotters had a lasting impact on Catholics in the UK.  Catholic men could not hold office (even an army commission) and were not given the vote until the 19th Century.  Edward VIII had to abdicate (in part) for marrying a catholic in the 20th century!    This book covers a key period of English history (transition from Tudor to Stuart) in an exciting way and provides a foundation for a better understanding of the next several hundred years.	2004-09-23

If you don't know about affiliate programs, marketing, on-line auctions then this book will be invaluable.  Apply the tactics in this book and you will make money, even from a hobby site. It helped me make my site ([...]) and collecting hobby pay for itself.  The first chapter ($24k in 24 hrs)is hype, but it makes a good point - work your customer base. Makes a great off the shelf strategy.  It is surprising how many sites could benefit from applying the techniques (hobby, commercial and not for profit.  There is no reason a not for profit can use affiliate schemes for extra revenue).    If you have a hobby site, and want to make it pay, or own a bricks and mortar business and are developing a web site, this book will add value.  Allen's book explains how to market on the net simply and effectively.    If you have a web site, are good at marketing and you get nothing from the book you are doing well.  This is worth a read, just as a check list. You need to apply yourself to make the techniques work, they depend on good content and you will have to have (or develop) reasonable IT skills (or access to someone who does) to exploit this book to the full.    Allen's books on real estate involve a fair degree of risk.  This book doesn't (it does involve hard work and effort).  I am not a big fan of his other texts, but this one is excellent (he uses people with greater expertise to write key chapters).    If your cynical about this review, or the book (reasonable), check it out before buying.  Also, make sure you are looking at the second edition.	2004-09-23

Buying a property for no or little money down is possible, and this book shows the principals and strategy for making alot of money from the property market using this strategy.  It's money well spent in comparison to the Sunday morning info-mercials on this topic.<br /><br />There is NOT good coverage of the RISKS.  Allen is suggesting the most highly leveraged transactions you clould ever enter (short of buying futures on margin).  Win, win big.  Loose - you are Bankrupt (if your starting with minimum assets).<br /><br />This is a good way to make money, there are risks and you must understand them.  As well as knowing your market.<br /><br />If you buy with no money down AND the market is going up you can't really loose.  The things that spoil this, are:<br />* Macro economics - interest rates go out of control.<br />* Local markets.  E.g. what is going to happen to the property market in Florida after the sting of hurricans?<br /><br />The author brings home the power of leverage (this is pivotal to growing your net worth, whatever your strategy).  He doesn't cover off the risks so well.  Must have for prospective real estate investor; but underplays the downside.<br /><br />Post Script: Clearly the people who wrote the next couple of reviews really don't like any critique of Allen's work.  I wrote this book \\"UNDERPLAYS\\" the downside, I didn't argue the book ignores it.  For example, the medium and long term impact on Florida's real estate values can't be determined yet - insurance increases and coverage issues wont surface for at least a few months, when they do, it will impact premiums.  The damage and loss will also act as a detterant to potential buyers considering a move.<br /><br />The exit strategies outlined in the book are superficial.  Also, in the simplest of terms, getting rid of don't want property in a down market is very hard work (it isn't always possible).<br /><br />This book addresses the risks of the last property crash quite well, and is not a get rich quick book.  It does not, however,(IMHO)address SYSTEMIC or MARKET risk adequately.  As pointed out, it was on the NY times best seller list for weeks (btw you can now pick it up really cheaply new or secondhand on Amazon, $8 off list price, cheaper than Barnes & Noble - mine will be listed shortly; this is a great service Amazon provides).<br /><br />Timing the market is great in theory, but buy high sell higher is very hard work in a crash!!!!!  Of course, we aren't heading for one .... there is no need to worry.  Buy high sell higher can be fools gold - in particular if the market is a BUBBLE (for a good account of every market bubble since the Sixteenth Century read 'Devil take the hindmost: A history of financial speculation, Edward Chancellor.<br /><br />I still think this is a good book, but want a better one? My suggestions would be Managing Rental Properties for Maximum Profit, or Investing in Real Estate 4th edition (very good coverage of leverage).  I'm looking to buy my second US investment property (my previous realestate experience has been overseas) and I am researching my next steps.<br /><br />Although this is an interesting and good book, the advice in these alternatives appears much more realistic and sound.TEMIC or MARKET risk adequately.

I planted some hop runners, but my back yard is too small for a decent crop. <br /> <br />The cautions in the book are important - it is best not to take a chance with some plants.  I have some old recipes that will result in the production of wood alcohol, if followed to the letter (e.g. potato - fermented for wine, distilled into Poteen and some ciders will make you understand the term blind drunk.  OK, they aren't the herbs in the book, but the old ways aren't always the best).  That said, I'm all in favor of experimentation - nettle is a great additive. <br /> <br />Excellent interesting book.	2004-09-14

The analysis that France, Germany, Russia and China are selling arms to the enemies of the US and world peace in general is spot on.  Nuclear proliferation in both Pakistan and India could become an increasingly dangerous threat to world peace (not just the US) should conflict erupt again in the Indian sub-continent (Kashmir has been the cause of several wars and perpetual tension since the partition).  And North Korea is anyones guess.  The book is a must read for anyone with an interest in the arms trade, even though it is biased it has an important message. <br /> <br />Where the books coverage ends is the proliferation of nuclear and high tech weapons, either by poor security, or as a result of corporate interests from US companies trading with China. China has also coducted espionage in the US (See Cox report: a bi-partisan report on US National security and trade with China).  Also, did Israel develop its nuclear program with no help? Further, it looks like the 2001 anthrax attacks were a domestic issue (who allowed this to happen?). <br /> <br />Some of the other reviewers have commented on the supply of Arms by the US to other countries.  Rogue elements of the Reagan administration supplying arms to Iran isn't a sound example in scale or motive.  The UK and US arming Afgahn rebels during their war with the USSR is probably a better but still imperfect analogy.   <br /> <br />The US is the number one supplier of arms (by value), including the number one supplier of landmines (many countries have banned production).  The UK is within the top five (in front of or behind france?).  If you attend an arms fair in the US, UK, france, Germany and Italy you are likely to see the same companies, whether it's the Aberdeen Prooving ground or an airfield in france. <br /> <br />To ensure the US (and UK)can help limit arms proliferation, we must ensure adeqaute internal security.  Also, in order to pass judgement on others we should ensure our own house is in order.  Great book, but well worth re-reading the Cox report.	2004-09-13

The artwork is excellent, the humor is cutting and provocative.  This is a cartoonist who can make a picture speak a thousand words.  Danziger captures the emotion of the world events that have impacted us all, and still makes them funny with a dry sardonic wit.  Many of the cartoons are very poignant.    If you think politicians and the poweful deserve referential treatment and respect, by virtue of their position, don't buy this book, unless you want to be outraged.    The title, Wreckage begins with W doesn't really do the collection of cartoons justice - it covers the full spectrum of events over the last four years.  It goes far beyond lampooning one easy target (not to say that coverage of W is in any way lacking!).    This is a must read book for anyone who enjoys political cartoons and satire.	2004-09-12

This is an excellent book for anyone who is uneasy with technology and wants to sell on eBay.  I think ebay for dummies does a better and more rounded job though. <br /> <br />If you have any experience with eBay, or are looking for something that will help you maximize your returns, this book will be of no value (eBay secrets is a great alternative, how to do everything with an eBay Busibess is also good). <br /> <br />I can see why this book has extremes of reviews, I didn't find it helpful. I borrowed it and I am glad I didn't pay for it.  That said, I work with computers day in day out.  Great book for people who don't.	2004-09-10

I have no interest in learning a martial art and wanted some easily learned steps to apply, should I get caught up in street crime (I am going to a country, for work, where street crime is high). <br /> <br />I knew a few of the tactics listed in the book (go for the eyes, groin, larynx or carotid artery / jugular).  These were taught to me by an OTC instructor in college.  This book is practical advice that can be learnt fairly quickly.  The chapter on the winning mind is great. <br /> <br />The book is easy to follow, has enough illustrations, and gave me just what I wanted.  Great book.	2004-09-09

One factor the book does not cover is the impact of pre-training views on race, relegion or ideology on the ability to kill.  If the enemey is not similar, killing is easier.  In particular if there is pre-existing prejudice. (Wonder if non firing rates were similar on the eastern front between the soviets and Germans).    The suggestion that television and video games provide children with conditioning to kill probably has validity (I agree with this opinion).  However, this book provides no proof.      It is interesting to note that the US Army has an on-line video game on it's recruiting web site.  I have edited this review since seeing it - I don't think the author makes his case on video games - the web site certainly does!	2004-09-09

It is a cute, funny and well written piece of social comment (don't agree with all of it but it's so well executed I had to give it five stars). <br /> <br />I had an English teacher who explained the origins of some old nursery rhymes.  Ring around the roses (black death - the ring and rose refers to the sore, a'tu refers to the sneezing.  Plague symptoms.)  And possibly the most appropriate for this book, The Grand Old Duke of York, He had 10,000 men, he marched them up to the top of the hill and he marched them down again again.  When they were up they were up, when they were down they were down, and when they were half way up they were neither up n'or down.  19 Century rhyme reffering to an inept English military leader.  The rhyme parodied his actions. <br /> <br />I think this will be a classic.  Excellent execution with a deceptively simple style.  I think this writing will have a very long shelf life, at least it deserves to.	2004-09-07

It is a must have (for academic study or implementation), if only for the completeness of coverage and the comprehensive references.  The C code provided is adequate, but reasonable programming skills are assumed.  The book is not overly mathematical (which many of the other cryptography texts are - this is great for me, as I am more intereseted in practice).  There is also good information on assessing / comparing the merits of different algorithms.  Great for the practictioner or student taking a first course (it's still not bedtime reading).

Everyone who uses eBay regularly should be able to take something away from this book.    As a previous reviewer has stated, some of the tips are common sense, and come straight off the ebay site.  However, its great to have these tips in one place and easily referenced.  This can serve as a checklist for your own buying and selling procedures.    PS:  Second edition has now been released.  Make sure you are buying the new one.    The one big negative - no coverage of the latest 'bid sniping software'.  This automates your bidding, allows better planning, does not increase the sell value early in the auction and maximizes the chance of winning (by placing a bid in the last seconds of auction).  This software isn't highly publicized by ebay.    This is a great book, but look out for newer texts covering the latest auction software.	2004-08-26
US	44625755	RR323LR6QER2P	1585423459	865745269	The European Dream	Books	4	91	105	N	N	Is there a European Dream?	This is a well written, comprehensively researched and thought provoking book that attempts to define a developing \\"European Dream\\".  A parallel argument is also made that the \\" American Dream\\" has run its course. A good case is made for suggesting the American work ethic and optimism for the future is being replaced by a society where luck is more important than hard work and a pesimistic outlook is starting to prevail.    Riffkin accuratley describes key and fundamental differences that do exist between the USA and Europe. He suggests the US is more religous, less concerned about environment and measures sucess by wealth.  Europeans are more interested in quality of life and are increasingly matching or surpassing the productivity of the US worker (my summary does not do justice to his text).    Where I do think Rifkins work becomes prophecy is the concept of a European dream.  I am English, and I do recognise the UK isn't the most pro european of member states.  However, the concept of a United States of Europe with a shared dream appears far off, and getting further away with the inclusion of so many new eastern european states (having got shot of the USSR they are only now enjoying a renewed sense of national identity).  There isn't even agreement within the UK for a common dream (between the Scots, Welsh, English and not forgetting the folks in Northern Ireland).    This is a fascinating book with numerous interesting predictions.  Only time will tell.	2004-08-23

The coverage of the ten domains is strong and and provides an excellent basis for preparing.  The CISSP domain I found hardest to study for was Cryptography - this book provides great 'plain English' coverage of this topic.

The premise of the book, that application security is now the key risk area for exploits is spot on.  Exploits of applications can be devestating.  This book describes basic attacks on application software; unfortunately the level of detail varies from example to example making it a little difficult to follow.  It does provide valuable examples for those developing software of potentail problem areas and common faults.  It is is also of potential value in planning penetration tests.  There is no real coverage of secure coding practices and how to integrate security into the development   process though.  The book is worth getting but provides far from exhaustive coverage of code expoitation.	2004-08-19

Internment has failed in the fight against terror.  During the '70's it was tried and failed by the British Government, to combat the IRA.  This situation compares well to the present fight on terror - internment was limited to 'suspects' and was not mass internment.  This act provided the IRA with greater legitamcy, increased funding (from US and Eire) and stiffened resistance in Republican areas. It was politically inept and did nothing to stem or stop violence.  In fact it succeeded in making the IRA a more effective organization, it was a factor in a move to the \\"cell\\" strucure.    The South African regime (40's to 80's)interned ANC freedom fighters (labled terrorists by many on the conservative right - Nelson Mandella is now a respected elder statesman)and failed to achieve the desired effect. Whatever short term benefits may be derived, in the longer term Internment provides propaganda, aids recruitment and increases funding for terrorist organizations.   Although non Japanese aliens were interned during the Second World War, internment of Germans and Italians was focussed and based on more than just race or nationality. The author attempts to compare the Japanese to practitioners of the Muslim relegion (the camps would have to be a little bigger ......).    Post Script; to the reviewer above:  I happen to be Conservative, agree with the War in Iraq and have read the book.  I am not \\"PC\\".     My objection to this book is based purely on past results of deploying internment as a tactic. Other examples of failed internment policies, where end objectives were not met, are plentiful.  The book does not consider these and parallels between WWII Japanese and Muslims just don't work.  It may surprise many of the reviewers who have rated this book highly that many muslims are Asian or even white.  Perhaps it would help if we all carried a Govt issued ID card with our relegion...    Internment was frequnetly used by the British; although shortterm results could be argued to be effective, longer term results were damaging. Examples include:  Boer War (first ever concentration camps - war was won but generations of hatred), India (Ghandi and other activists imprisoned), Israel (detention of potential Jewish migrants in Cyprus) and Cyprus.      The most extreme example of the failure of Internment is NAZI Germany.  Hitler diverted valuable military resources to running camps; at the same time he alienated eastern europeans who would otherwise willingly assisted in his war with the Soviet Union.  Stalin was no better (internment based on politics, nationality, relegion and his own paronoia).  The USSR made significant use of internment, many people were locked up in gulags or deported to other regions.    Compensation for internees may or may not have been the right thing to do. The compensation issue is old news. However, the US Government, Allies, China and Korea haven't and should seek compensation from Japan for the atrocities committed against unarmed civilians and POW's while these vetrans are still alive. This is far more important issue than complaining (belatedly) about an action that cant be undone.      The book fails to provide a sound justification for internment and does not address the issue of whether internment will simply inflame hatred of the US, making the job of the Soldiers in the field harder.	2004-08-10
