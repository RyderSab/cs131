Longing for clothing, leisure and privilege, she soon takes up with Drouet, a man willing to support her if she'll consent to live together, unmarried.  From there, she develops an attraction for a married man, Hurstwood, and the power and privilege he possesses.  Their relations and the result of their decisions constitute much of the book. <br /> <br />This novel presented scandalous scenarios of a young, impressionable, and not especially moral woman in a rather dispassionate tone.  It was a rebellious scenario for the times and worth reading for the glimpse it provides into American big city life in the early 20th century. <br /> <br />The writing, however, is unsophisticated, especially in the first half and the characters are superficial.  Readers aren't allowed a deeper look into their minds and motivations.  Except at one point, when Hurstwood engages in serious deception, the book lacks the tension and strong plot that drive American Tragedy.   <br /> <br />For those who haven't read Dreiser before, American Tragedy is a better place to start.  But for those who want to read more of his work, Sister Carrie offers a interesting look into morality, family, and urban life.     <br />	2005-10-08

Portraying a broad range of characters - from new immigrants, to an Indian tour guide looking for love, to a young woman suffering seizures from lack of sexual contact, to a bedraggled apartment cleaner, all the characters have one characteristic in common - a search for love.   <br /> <br />All the stories but one were previously published and almost all of them are marked by elegant prose and a deep, moving humanity that crashes through the pages.  This is one of those rare finds that cause a reader to set the book down in a state of awe. <br />	2005-09-26

I found it to be just that.  In the first third, she writes a series of remarkable essays about California in the late 1960s.  The middle third contains personal essays.  And the book finishes with a collection of essays about different places she's been - New York, Hartford, Hawaii, Sacramento. <br /> <br />What makes her writing most impressive is her masterful presentation of portraits, inserting herself just occasionally to remind the reader of who the photographer was, to inject humanity.  She does an excellent job combining place and character and shows that long sentences can work.  This book is useful both an as example to those who aspire to writing better essays and as a memorable voice from the 1960s. <br />	2005-09-02

Both the premise and the narration of the book are unique.  The story is told by a blind narrator, a boy who grew up in the neighborhood, who the reader never gets to know.  Nor does the reader delve deeply into the lives of the Lisbon sisters.  Instead, they see the family, the neighborhood, the school through the fog-like lens of the adult narrator looking back on his boyhood.   <br /> <br />The writing is good, often beautiful, though sometimes purple, a clear prelude to Eugenides more masterful work in Middlesex.  The book reads easily and takes readers through the fugue of a strange few years.  In the end though, there are no answers, and readers must be satisfied with peering through the fog.	2005-08-29

It's easy to imagine 19th century readers eagerly looking forward to the next installment.  Through an effective use of foreshadowing, powerful character development, and diverse viewpoints presenting the story, the 569-page book retains suspense throughout.  Occasionally, the reader needs to suspend their belief, or to not pay too much attention to overdone or unrealistic details.  But the vast majority of the thick tome is a well-done mystery and an undeservedly hidden gem of a classic.	2005-08-04

When her tendency to tell stories spreads to real life, the consequences last the rest of her life. <br /> <br />The story is beautifully woven together, beginning with a pre-war warm summer evening, taking readers through the British retreat, and ending at the cusp of the 21st century.  Despite some incredibly long sentences, McEwan's writing is often striking, especially at the beginning and end of the novel.   <br /> <br />The book is a page turner in the first section, with a shocker at the end of each chapter.  The pace slows in the middle, but then ends with a surprise, weavening the moving story together.  <br /> <br />If the entire book had been as good as the opening and conclusion, it would have been amazing.  As it is, it's a well written and intriguing story, well worth a read.  <br />	2005-08-02

However, the marks of his future skill are there, in the gems of wording and imagery scattered throughout the book. <br /> <br />The novel tells the story of George Caldwell, a self-deprecating schoolteacher who is certain he is approaching death.  His world revolves around his misbehaving and unappreciative students, his domineering boss, the wife he wasn't meant to marry, his father in law, who could fall down the stairs at any time, and his scab-ridden 14-year-old son Peter.   <br /> <br />When George and Peter spend three days together in a snowstorm, the reader is treated to a development of the relationship between father and son.  We see Peter's embarrassment of his dorky dad, at the same time we see his respect and care for him.  Both unusual, but thoroughly likeable characters, father and son deal with their poverty, the car problems that keep them from home, and George's medical and psychological exhaustion that make him wonder if he should continue teaching.   <br /> <br />At the beginning and end of the story, the myths of Chiron and Prometheus are woven in, doubles for the two main characters.  Those with a strong grasp of mythology may find many deeper layers to the story.  Those without can skim over the mythology and still enjoy the story. <br />	2005-08-02

After his death, she and Fay go back to his home, each to react to the past and future in their own way. <br /> <br />Some reviewers say this book is character rather than plot driven.  And that's correct.  But I never got a full sense of the characters.  For example, I couldn't see either Laurel or Fay.  I could only hear their voices and imagine their actions.   <br /> <br />This book is a great example of showing rather than telling.  Readers induce the characters from their dialogue and reactions.  But I found the dialogue to become long and tedious, the secondary characters confusing, and I longed for more description of the places and characters.  I finished the book unsatisfied, longing for something more. <br />	2005-06-22

When an affair with a student prematurely ends his career and leaves him in disgrace, he goes to visit his only daughter on a rural farm.  There, he and his daughter experience an act of violence that tests their relationship with each other, with their neighbors and with their land of South Africa. <br /> <br />Coetzee's prose is spare, flowing, and beautiful, compelling the reader to go on, inserting the characters and themes into the reader's mind, where they continue to swirl long after putting the book down.   <br /> <br />All of the characters in the book have a dark side, a questionable morality that prevents complete empathy.  Yet they are all human, and Coetzee presents them in a realistic light, leaving the reader to thrash through frustration, pity, anger, and finally, understanding.  A well-written and powerful novel, well worth reading. <br />	2005-06-13

Jones creates a compelling cast of characters, from old women in Bible studies, to shopkeepers, criminals, and parents.   <br /> <br />The first few stories lacked the depth to allow the reader to care for or feel deeply for the character.  But by the fourth story in the book, Young Lions, this changes.  The reader sees and experiences the world through the perspective of a criminal.  Subsequent stories take the reader into various households and families, showing the inner workings of kin, neighbors, and enemies in the city.     <br /> <br />Some stories are sad, others heartwarming, but all are real.  The heroes are important people, who make up the heart of Washington, but who find themselves represented in literature all too rarely.  An important book, especially for those who live in or have a connection with the capitol city. <br />	2005-06-13

There they revive the house and the mine once operated by Richard's grandfather.  They intend to live there for the rest of their lives, but Richard is diagnosed with a blood disorder and given a forecast of five to six more years. <br /> <br />In that time, Richard and Sara build their home, the mine and their lives among the local people.  After an arresting opening, beautifully describing their move to Ibarra, the book reads like a fugue, moving from one scene to another, back and forth in time, in a dreamlike state.  Sara possesses an active imagination and is fond of making things up, often imaging the details in life that she fails to see.   <br /> <br />The first few chapters are stunning, the writing drawing the reader fully into the Everton's world.  Subsequent chapters were occasionally dense, losing the lightness and magic found in the opening.   <br /> <br />Doerr successfully avoids getting bogged down in the day-to-day details of life in Ibarra, focusing instead on the most significant characters and stories she heard during her stay there.  A good read overall, this is a particularly good example for people interested in travel or cultural memoirs.   <br />	2005-06-01

Stewart '26 Series)	Books	4	9	9	N	Y	One of the best modern personal introductions to Siberia	The Other Side of Russia emerged from Barbara Hudgins experience of living in Siberia for a year and a half, from 1993 to 1994.  Working as the onsite program coordinator for the University of Maryland University College in Siberia and the Russian Far East, she worked and lived in Vladivostok and Irkutsk. <br /> <br />Hudgins book is the first book about Siberia I'd come across written by someone who spent extensive time in Siberia.  This gives her a depth of understanding that adds a lot to her memoir.   <br /> <br />The structure of her memoir is unusual.  She's divided the book into two sections.  The chapters in part one focus on place - Irkutsk, Vladivostok, Lake Baikal, etc. - and the chapters in the second part focus on aspects of life and culture in Siberia - housing, education, food and festivals.  Hudgins supplemented her first-hand experience with extensive research.  This offers readers an in-depth source of information about many aspects of Siberian place and life.   <br /> <br />What's lost in this non-chronological format is Hudgin's own adaptations and reactions over her time in Siberia.  She does insert some feelings and personality, but the focus is on the topic, rather than on her personal experience or characters who change and develop over the period. <br /> <br />Hudgins seems to have thrown herself into Siberia with a remarkably open mind.  She expertly captures the small details of Siberian life and renders vivid pictures of feasts shared with Russian friends.  For those who have been to Siberia, this book will take you back there.  For those planning on going, The Other Side of Russia provides a great overview of the life and culture. <br />	2005-06-01

Her style is a series of scenes - dialogues, sights, events - that bring alive moments of Chinese life and culture, as she saw it.  She seems to stand back and let the people and their actions speak for themselves.<br /><br />Mahoney has an eye for detail and a talent for descriptions.  She described the place - whether it was her apartment, a school stairway, or the streets of Shanghai, so that I could see and smell them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, she left herself and her feelings almost entirely out of the book, leaving readers to wonder what previous exposure she had to China, what brought her there, and how she felt in the situations she described.  Characters that must have played a major role in her experience there - such as her American roommate, or the teachers in her teaching group - are barely mentioned.  Other characters showcase interesting personalities or cultural characteristics, but I longed to get to know them better, to see a deeper picture, to know more about how she related to them.  Most of all, I wanted to know how her experiences and interactions changed her conceptions of the world, of them, and of herself.<br /><br />This book provides a sensitive and nicely written portrait of China at a time of change.  And the discussion of Chinese/Japanese animosities is still timely fifteen years later.  But there is a feeling throughout the book that something is missing - the presence of the author herself.	2005-04-27

They move to Detroit, have children and one of their children marries a cousin.  The result of their marriage is Calliope Stephanides, the narrator of Middlesex and a hermaphrodite. <br /> <br />Eugenides takes readers through an epic history of three generations of a Greek family and the 50-year transition of Detroit life.  The characters are unique, vivid and evoke sympathy and understanding.  The writing is evocative and the story epic, taking readers from a remote Turkish village to the growth of the American automobile industry, the Detroit racial riots, and the San Francisco sex scene.   <br /> <br />The last quarter of the book, after Calliope (Cal) finds out that she's a hermaphrodite, the action is rapid and sometimes seems over-the-top.

The loser must stand naked outside an English pub and sing the Moldovan National Anthem. <br /> <br />I was given this book by a Moldovan friend who was impressed with the accuracy that Hawks portrayed her native country.  Having paid a short visit to this very untouristed country myself, it was enjoyable to see such an unknown place portrayed in the mainstream press.  And Hawks does a wonderful job.  A comic by professional, Hawks is a gifted writer that brings his travels and the people he meets along the way to life, providing plenty of laughs along the way.  He is also a philosophical advocate for a positive attitude.  While he recognizes that the source of his optimism stems from all the opportunities he was provided where he was born, the contrast with the dour Moldovans provides for lots of cross cultural tension.  A truly enjoyable read whether you're planning to go to Moldova or not.  Recommended. <br />	2005-03-09

The first part of the book, which relates her childhood, is vivid, moving and powerful.  It created a tension that kept me turning the pages. <br /> <br />But as the main character moved into adulthood, I felt the string holding the story together weaken.  I kept waiting for something I felt had been foreshadowed earlier, but it didn't come.  Readers don't get to know the adult Elaine with the same intimacy as they know the child.  When pieces were left unresolved, I wondered why I had spent so much time reading about her adult life when the core of the book was concentrated in the first half.  <br /> <br />I was intrigued enough by Atwood's style to try out some more of her work.  This book is a good read, especially in the first half, but the second half was a letdown for this reader. <br />	2005-03-09

This book covers the globe in its range of articles and essays, from Papa New Guinea to the Texas/Mexican border, from Greece to the Sahara, from Bolivia to Israel.   <br /> <br />I found several inclusions to be truly excellent - especially Scott Anderson's piece on 9/11, Rod Davis's article on the US-Mexican border in Texas, Michael Finkel's article about the void in the Sahara, Elizabeth Nickson's piece on Salt Spring Island, Molly O'Neill following a Cambodian chef home, Kira Salak in Papa New Guinea, and Kate Wheeler in violent Bolivia.  Some pieces though were a bit blah and the fact that they were alphabetically arranged meant the flow wasn't ideal.  For example, the first 144 pages of the book were all by male writers, leaving me starved for a different perspective by the time I reached Kate Hennessey's piece. <br /> <br />There is a decidedly male tone to the book, which I found disappointing, with only 7 women represented among the 26 writers.  This was reflected in a thematic focus of finding the most outlandish, isolated place on earth.  I would have liked a little less reading about people setting out to do what no one had done before, and more human interactions with people of different places and cultures.   <br /> <br />But overall, this book offers armchair travelers the opportunity to enter many different worlds from the comfort of their favorite reading place. <br />	2005-03-09

After a period of mourning, Flor finds what seems like the perfect husband in the pharmacist Teodoro - kind, loving, intelligent, organized and respectful.  While her life becames calm and happy, she finds that she misses the spark and the love that Vadinho provided.  When Vadinho suddenly returns from the dead, intent on seducing Flor, she must decide between her loyalty to her second husband and her attraction to her first.   <br /> <br />At times funny, bawdy, sexy, and beautiful, this book is a good example of magical realism.  Written in the 1960s, it is also far ahead of its time in its portrayal of female sexual desire and patriarchal traditions.  It also provides an interesting portrait of middle-class Bahian life.   <br /> <br />At times, it was slow moving, especially in the beginning.  The second husband isn't introduced until well into the second half of the book and some parts seemed overly drawn out.  At times, the translation felt a bit rough. <br /> <br />A unique book that calls upon the supernatural, but deals with issues grounded in human reality.  Worth a read.   <br />	2005-02-24

The men who were supposedly the brightest and most able men ever assembled by a President.  The men who led their country into the disastrous Vietnam war. <br /> <br />Halberstam spent over two years interviewing people to write this book and he clearly did his research.  His writing shows a clear understanding of the region, history, politics and players.  Despite some repetitive or dry sections, most of the book is surprisingly fast-moving and well written.   <br /> <br />In an effort to portray a complete picture of the players, there are a lot of men covered, not all of whom seem critical.  I felt I could use an organizational chart or a quick reference section at the end to remember who was who and what their role was. <br /> <br />Though written over 30 years ago, this book's lessons are still relevant today.  Halberstam teaches readers about the restrictions on speaking up against China policy, then Vietnam.  He tells of how the officials demanded patriotism, opposing viewpoints were closed off, considered non-patriotic, their proponents excluded from access to power.  The lesson is the importance of debate, of being open to information (bad news as well as good), of the difficulty many people have in holding on to their principles when power is at stake. <br /> <br />Perhaps the greatest lesson of the book is that \\"best and brightest\\" is a relative term.  Even the seemingly most perfect people have flaws that can have disastrous consequences, especially in situations where dissent is discouraged and problems are papered over.  And also, that best and the brightest in the 1960s was an exclusive word, limited to ambitious white men, most of whom craved power and were afraid to make mistakes.  If the definition of best and brightest had been more inclusive, if different types of intelligent and thoughtful people had been allowed access to decision-making, the results might have been different. <br />   <br />For those interested in how decisions were made from the American side, in how a group of smart men could make such serious mistakes, this is a book worth reading. <br />	2005-01-31

The One Minute Manager Builds High Performing Teams was my first introduction to the series. <br /> <br />The book is written as a conversation between the One Minute Manager (a nameless, faceless character), a curious manager named Dan, and a human resource manager named Maria who brought up the question of how to manage teams versus individuals.  <br /> <br />The print is large and there are only a few paragraphs per page, making it quick and easy reading, especially for those who only have time to read a small segment at a time.  The dialogues are occasionally dull and a bit pedantic, but the messages come through clearly.  And these messages, how to diagnose the development stage a team is currently in and which management style is appropriate for each stage of development, are usual analysis tools for anyone leading a group.  The messages from the book can also easily be identified and passed on to group members through a short presentation.   <br /> <br />A worthwhile book to look at for anyone wanting to improve team motivation, productivity and functioning. <br />	2005-01-16

The One Minute Manager introduces readers to the three techniques of one-minute management - clear goal setting, one-minute praisings and one-minute reprimands. <br /> <br />The points are laid out clearly and the recommendations simple and easy to implement.  The book can be read quickly in a single sitting or several short pages at a time.  Those with very little time can read the four pages that summarize all the points made in the book. <br /> <br />What bothered me about the book was the portrayal of the business world as a very male environment.  A young man looks for the perfect manager and finds the amazing One Minute Manager, referred to throughout the book as, \\"quite a guy!\\"  The male employees, described by age, explain goal setting and praisings.  The female employees, described with adjectives indicating their dress or competence, are secretaries, those providing general info, or those being reprimanded.  All but one of the acknowledgements are to men as are all but one endorsement.  The authors use sports - golf, football and bowling, as analogies, making for a tone off-putting to female readers.  Only on the last page does a young woman come to the formerly young man, now a successful One Minute Manager, seeking advice. <br /> <br />It's not a bad book, if you can ignore the gender stereotypes, but it's also quite basic.  I learned more from the One Minute Manager Builds High Performing Teams. <br />	2005-01-16

Despite his wealth and condo in Florida, his life has not become comfortable.  Family turmoils continue, with Nelson behaving strangely, his daughter-in-law sending romantic signals, his wife defending their son's weaknesses while becoming more independent of Rabbit as she enters the working world.   <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Rabbit reflects on his age and his mortality, graphically portraying the realities and fears of late middle age in a way that brings the reader, regardless of age or sex, vividly into the life and thoughts of an aging man.     <br /> <br />Continuing a gradual increase in literary quality throughout the quartet, this is a powerful novel.  Occasionally slowed by overly long passages or excessive description, it does an excellent job of integrating the small details of life with Rabbit's larger reflections and philosophical outlooks. Updike is especially talented at portraying the hypocrisies, tensions, idiosyncrasies, and failures in communication, so common in life.  Updike shows us what it is to be human, what it means to live, and how it's possible to run incessantly, without ever arriving anywhere. <br />  <br />This book can stand on its own, but is most fulfilling read as the fourth book in the series. <br />	2004-12-30

His son is grown, his middle has expanded, his marriage has solidified and through his work as a car salesman, Rabbit has settled into small town affluence.  Yet his mistakes from the past continue to haunt him, through the appearance of a daughter he had through an affair twenty years back, and the actions of his son Nelson, which frustrate Rabbit to no end, yet are reminiscent of who Rabbit was a generation earlier.  As Rabbit matures and is accepted into a community, his son continues the legacy of abdicating responsibility and struggling to find oneself. <br /> <br />In this book, the third of a four-book series, Updike's writing continues to improve.  Despite some excessive detail and conversations that could have been deleted without effecting the story, Updike demonstrates his substantial gift at carrying the reader along through the story, of showing us the tiny details that make up our world, from the shape of one's eyebrows to toe prints on the poolside.  His writing, especially about sex and thoughts about mortality, is blunt and honest, a fusion of humor and seriousness, a representation of all that goes into one life. <br />	2004-11-24

Wharton tells the story of Newland Archer, a young man raised in this society, but who possesses a unique ability to question the rules.  During his engagement to May Welland, he meets a woman of questionable background who knocks down the beliefs embedded in him through his upbringing.  The story of their relationship and its effect on his marriage show the tensions in this society and how its members worked to preserve their culture.  Early in the book, the abundant details of dress and decoration of the times become tedious, but Wharton's portrait of individuals, their thoughts, and how the society affected their life choices is masterful.  An enjoyable and educational read.	2004-09-15

By taking the readers through the overwhelming detail of Kate's life, Pearson illustrates the difficulties women face balancing work and family.   <br /> <br />The book is a fast read and has the feel of chick-lit.  This makes Kate Reddy's life easily available to busy female readers.  Parts of the book seem a little simplified and especially in the early section, the reader feels beat over the head with the message that the balancing life is tough.  But it is light reading with a serious message.  Interspersed throughout the text are some insightful and thought-provoking statements about the state of the world and the difficulties women have in molding themselves to a world set up for men's success. <br /> <br />What frustrated me about the book was that while Pearson admirably chronicled Kate's thoughts and feelings and eventual sacrifice, she didn't really tackle the issues of why women are forced to assume so much responsibility.  In this book, Kate herself, by wanting to meet the expectations of everyone, from her employer to the Court of Motherhood, was a participant in her own hanging.  While her husband encouraged her to cut back on some of the domestic responsibilities, she didn't feel she could.  But despite both Kate and Richard's enlightened outlook, there was never a discussion about Richard cutting back on his work, despite the fact that Kate was the main breadwinner.   <br /> <br />This book opens the discussion of an issue that is critical to the future of working mothers.  I hope that other authors will take off from Pearson's work and go beyond the despair to investigate more deeply the causes of the double burden and to suggest solutions for both the individual and the societal level. <br />	2004-09-03

The most masterful essay comes first, a spectacularly constructed and delivered piece on Franzen's father's struggle with Alzheimer's.   <br /> <br />What I found disappointing was the didactic tone of some of the essays and the way Franzen occasionally lost focus, spiraling off onto tangents that I didn't find particularly revelatory or interesting.  Some of the essays, such as one on privacy and another called the \\"Harper's Essay\\" did not catch my attention or interest at all.  They spiraled in so many directions that I lost track of the main point.  Whether it might have been easier to follow by reading (I listened to the audio CDs), I don't know.     <br /> <br />In the end, I was interested in what he had to say, but only found portions compelling.	2004-08-24

Theobold's son Ernest, the novel's main character, is not exceptionally bright, motivated or gifted.  Yet he succeeds in throwing off the religious and moral mantle he inherited.  By doing so, he rejects the values of the age. <br /> <br />This book is most interesting read in it's historical context.  The discursions and lengthy sentences make it a slow read.

Each woman's day is extraordinary in its own way.  What is most remarkable is how the three women and their lives intertwine, both in the details and in the book.   <br /> <br />This book is an example of amazingly well done structure, beautiful imagery, and a remarkable tale of ordinary life and what makes people continue on through the hours.

Woven within the text are his relationships with a mobster, several women, and an unreliable literary friend.  <br />Citrine is an intellectual and a thinker.  Interspersed throughout the story are philosophical thoughts and conjectures about life.  Sometimes these further the story or provide more depth to a character, other times they seem like extraneous rambling.   <br />The strength of the book is Citrine's strong and unique narrative voice and the portrait of literary and mob life in Chicago, New York and Europe of the 1970s.  <br />What disappointed me about the book was that the lack of a strong story line made it difficult to continue reading.  I felt the same story could have been told in a few hundred fewer pages.  <br />Overall, not a terrible book, but not especially memorable.	2004-07-20

Her focus was on how couples lived and related on a day to day basis - from the division of household responsibilities, to planning for the futures, their sex lives, and their relations with their parents and children.<br />Interspersed between the stories was information about the role of women and the institution of marriage throughout history.<br />The reason I didn't give it five stars was that Harris piqued my interest in issues such as gender roles and division of responsibilities, but left these four middle-aged New York-area couples as examples without including more hard data.  I would have liked the factual sections expanded to include statistics from the fields of sociology and public policy, moving beyond the history of marriage to probe a bit deeper into what is going on today and why things are changing they way they are.<br />A unique book worth reading to see beyond the facades of marriages and glimpse how different couples handle the challenges of building a family.	2004-07-20

I picked it up at a bike store when I bought a new bike and am having a great time trying all the routes.  They are on the longish side - most are 30-40 miles - so this book is meant for those looking for a good half to full day ride.  On the other hand, you don't have to be very experienced.  I took my first 30-mile ride using this book.<br />Before using this book, I had no idea there were so many beautiful and interesting places to explore in central Jersey.  This book has taken me through numerous quaint towns, alongside beautiful lakes, rivers and ocean boardwalks, and allowed me to try local restaurants and food as I bike.  <br />The directions are clear (I've never found myself more than a few blocks off-track) and the author includes helpful information about local attractions and sights along the way.

Though the book suggests giving your boyfriend this book to read, it's clearly aimed at women in heterosexual relationships.  My one quip with the book was that there seemed to be some assumptions made throughout, such as almost certain opposition from the family, the guy making the suggestion of moving in together, a single reason for wanting to live together (rather than a combination of factors) and the female being more interested in eventual marriage.  A lot of the information came from the author's experience and several dozen of their friends.  I would have liked to see the circle of interviewees widened to get a broader view. But overall it's a good resource to look through, especially for the sections on making the decision, keeping the connection, and legal advice.	2004-06-12

He makes the protagonist, Rabbit (or Harry Angstrom) into a a true anti-hero, someone we really don't like, yet can't help caring what happens to him.  Rabbit is 36 in this book and his son is 13.  Still struggling with marriage, sex, family and himself, we see a new phase in his life's development.  There are strong sexist and racist tones to the book, especially at the beginning, some of which are dealt with by the characters by the end, others which reflect the unfortunate but real attitudes of the times.  The middle section of the book gets a bit bogged down in dialogues on political theory, but the rest is fresh and engaging.

Her writing is brutally honest and magically poetical as she takes the reader along beside her to relive these events.  They range from the traumas of an office shooting at the University of Iowa, her dog's slow death, her aunt's stealing her favorite doll, and her divorce, to the everyday scenes of youth and youth adulthood.  Her talent lies in taking ordinary pieces from her life and making them extraordinary.  Recommended.	2004-04-11

I was impressed with both the beginning and the end, but tired of the endless theme of mindless consumerism and personal despair.  At first I was impressed by DeLillo's sardonic wit and ability to form a plausible tale about a professor of Hitler studies afraid of death.  The ending effectively wrapped up the themes and the story and left me with a satisfying read.  Maybe he intended this, but I found myself frequently questioning when it would end and feeling tired and frustrated with the world that composed the bulk of the novel.  It was interesting that the main character did demonstrate human concerns and emotions, barely visible through the rubble of material and cultural garbage.	2004-04-11

He vividly describes the loneliness and hardships of life in rural Russia, as well as resistence of the peasants to modern medical knowledge.  He shows his inexperience, rudeness, and medical mistakes even more graphically, making one cringe for those under his knife or care.  The best story, Morphine, recounts a descent into morphine addiction by the addict himself.  This is emotional and moving, attributes that are missing from the tales Bulgakov tells himself.  He seems to be fixated on his own suffering and his own value as a doctor and a human and doesn't show much sympathy for his patients or his fellow rural residents.	2004-04-11

The tale of a conceited young man, plagued by a sense of futility and decay, alternating back and forth between two imperfect women reflects well a range of honest human emotions.  The focus is definitely on the men though.  The women in the story remain shallow and primarily serve sexual and reproductive roles.

It provides an intriguing look into Western character, especially of one man, Lyle, and the difficulty of life in this area.  Yet the overly poetical writing moves slowly.  Jumps back and forth through time and among characters make it hard to keep track of who is who.  It seems the author has lived in the area since childhood, but he largely leaves himself and his opinions out of the story.

Even though I have some background in the field, I still found it an interesting story.  However, the author relied heavily on Grameen staff and translators and I felt that the level of analysis and criticism that would have been useful was lacking.

Theroux traveled by train from England to Turkey, India, Singapore, Japan, several other countries, and back across the whole of Russia.  The tone is rather arrogant and I was disappointed that most of his time seemed to be actually spent on the train, rather than in the places he traveled to.  Reading about his many train companions and the train staff was not as interesting as hearing about the people on the street he spoke with.  I found the chapter on Vietnam interesting, but his trip home across Russia found him horribly depressed, and his negative attitude clouded the details of an experience that so many others have recorded as marvelous.	2004-04-11

While I probably would have enjoyed it even if I wasn't planning to mimic his trip anytime soon, knowing that I might follow in his footsteps made it all the more exciting.

It felt as though the book still needed cutting and fine-tuning and the long opening sentences and frequent use of large words made my attention stray.  It was also very much a boy's book, with the few women in the story usually serving mothering or sex roles.  Though it's definitely not among my favorites, the story of an unlikely team of comic book writers--a New York boy with low self-esteem and his Jewish cousin from Prague, escaping the Nazis, was unique, though at times, it felt stretched.	2004-04-11

He feels a masterpiece within him, but finds his efforts to focus on his work thwarted by pressures from the women in his life: his sister, his ex-wife, and his best friend's wife and daughter. Murdoch introduces Pearson as a reserved, self-indulged, and solitary man, committed to producing his life's masterpiece and averse to involve himself in others personal affairs. Reluctantly, he comes to the aid of those who seek him out each time he tries to depart for a quiet space in the countryside, further delaying the creation of his masterpiece. <br />The story starts out slowly. Pearson's self-absorption and righteousness do not inspire the reader's sympathy nor do the other characters, who privately abuse, cheat, or wish death upon their loved ones while maintaining respectable public appearances. Murdoch intersperses this introduction to the dual-natured main characters and their immediate crises with a great deal of philosophy about the nature of love, art and truth. These issues were Murdoch's passion as a philosopher, but the frequency with which she raises such difficult questions detracts from the story line. <br />Midway through the book, the pace picks up rapidly. Murdoch successfully involves the reader in the passion -- referred to as the black Eros -- that could awaken Pearson's creativity, causing lasting consequences and turning the relations between English intellectuals into a literary thriller. Murdoch twists and turns the story in a way that makes the reader care for and even sympathize with each character as they struggle with aspects of love and human emotion. The  narrative journey encompasses lust, violence, psychosis and adultery, as well as youth, vitality, trust and new beginnings. Combining murder, love and the relationships among a small group of aging Englishmen and women, Murdoch infuses psychological and philosophical tension intoa classic tale of love and murder. <br />Cutting down on the amount of philosophizing would have strengthened the story line. But despite Murdoch's refusal to allow editing of her work, The Black Prince made the shortlist for the Booker Prize. A timeless story that unravels timeless emotions, The Black Prince grips the reader with its surprising finale and the talons of Murdoch's writing.	2004-04-11

Templer writes with beautiful flowing prose, expressing complex ideas and thoughts in an enjoyable and easy to understand manner.  Thoroughly researched, this well-organized book provides some essential history and how the history relates to the modern society, then covers all of the main issues of Vietnamese culture and society - including hunger, writing, AIDS, youth, and corrruption - bringing a picture to life of an often confusing and stereotyped land.

Using his paintbrush as a wand and his imagination as a planner, he executes a series of actions to rankle the leaders.  As each side becomes more enmeshed in the conflict, the results are more serious, and often more humorous.

It provides a nice portrait of what exists, but lacks deep analysis to answer the question of why.	2004-04-11

The book was written soon after her release from prison.  As a result, the first part is angry and lacks some of the insight that could be obtained with distance and perspective. The second half is better though and the book is book is well worth reading, both as an inside look into recent Russian history, and as the inspiring story of a woman who went to great lengths to stand up for her beliefs.	2004-04-11

While some of the ideas (different forms of love, individuality, and stretching the limits of socially accepted behavior, life and death) were interesting, the way they were conveyed in this book was not effective for me.  None of the characteristics were likable, nor was I able to feel for any of them.  The book starts out with a woman having sex with a dolphin, and ends with unexpected deaths.  While some smaller sections were enjoyable to read, I generally found myself wishing this experience was over.	2004-04-11

The first half of the book, about Satan's reign of terror, is impressive in it's detail and fantasy.  I didn't enjoy the second half quite as much, about the saving of the Master and Margarita.  While there were some wonderfully rich scenes in the second half as well, I didn't feel close enough to the characters.  Overall though, a fascinating book with layers.	2004-04-11

Ruth, a Chinese American childless woman in her late 40s discovers her mother's history when she finds out that her mother has Alzheimer's.  By learning about her mother's descent from a bonesetter's daughter and her difficult early life, she better understands who her mother is and who she is.  Unfortunately though, it reads like an early draft, in need of more work in order to truly bring the readers into Chinese life.  It pales compared to Wild Swans.  A book with great potential, but overall, disappointing.	2004-04-11

Combined with Let's Go China and two phrasebooks we felt well equipped.  It would be great if this book would be updated though, for there is so much to explore in Yunnan alone.  We spent much of our five weeks in this region and still have lots left to see.	2001-01-02

The writing is good and I especially liked how place names were printed in Chinese characters (which made it easy to show taxi drivers).  I do find it regretful that the writers only spend seven weeks in the country though.  Many people travel during the other 45 weeks of the year and it would be nice to have authoritative information from the non-peak tourist season.	2001-01-02

The information is very old, the prices are completely out of whack, and someone in Russia took a look at the book and said it is virtually a carbon copy of the last edition.  The details on Siberia were pathetic.  It was clear that the writer had only been to a very few places and some information was outright incorrect.  I had much better luck with the Trans-Siberian Handbook by Bryn Thomas.  The information is three years old, but the information about major cities in Siberia and Russia is comprehensive, accurate, and engaging.	2001-01-01

Two males again, short amount of time in the country, and not very comprehensive visits.	2001-01-01

Those with a basic foundation in macroeconomics and an interest in Indian political economy will find this book offers a good analysis of how India arrived in the position it was in during the early 1990s.  Jalan also offers practical steps for the Indian government to adopt in order to improve economic performance.	2000-11-01

Their lives,  stories, and attitudes are admirable and this is a book well worth reading.	2000-01-12
