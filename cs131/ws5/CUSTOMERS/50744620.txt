As a writer, I'm much more intrigued with the MEANING of words than how they score on a Scrabble board.  Still, I can get a little obsessed with word puzzles, like George Bredehorn's SPLIT DECISIONS.  But my obsession pales in comparison to the folks in this book - including the author - they're all POSSESSED!!  This book is a fascinating journey into their world and Mr. Fatsis makes it come alive on the page.  The various levels of Scrabble addiction are depicted brutally and I found myself truly CARING about these players, how their tournaments went, what they learned and how they coped.  Games are a strange way to pass time, but how we handle the competition tells us a lot about ourselves.  This was a VERY interesting read - I heartily recommend it!	2002-07-25

In this small volume, Mr. Smith manages to inject many warm remembrances and anecdotes, along with well researched history of New York City's growing pains.  Peppered with the personal stories of those individuals directly affected by all the changes in mass transit of the past 150 years, this book vividly paints the political climate that shaped NYC and tells how the rise and fall of elevated trains impacted the entire city.	2002-07-04

Baby boomers especially will find much stimulation in these ponderings on learning to manage ageing, infirmity, family strife, duty, and forgiveness.  Kate Millett faced a lot in living through and then writing about the lessons of this book.  While not everyone will agree with her choices (or her politics!?) she still presents a coherent story that moved and involved me and I was gratified at her success in liberating her mother from the nursing home, as well as liberating HERSELF from many of her own personal demons.  Everyone feels SOME ambivalence towards their parents, and if we assume responsibility for their care, there are bound to be unpredictable issues arising.  Kate constantly reminds us (and herself!) of her mother's humanity and winds up handling most of her issues with grace, eventually coming to peace with ALL of them - both she and her mother are heroines here!	2002-06-30

This book is FILLED with pearls of wisdom and I'm SO glad I got it!  Feeling overwhelmed by the emotional and physical changes I've been experiencing lately, I chose to read this book cover-to-cover, which is probably not what the author intended, as there IS a bit of repetition in her Rx for menopausal complaints.  However, it was STILL a very helpful way for me to access Dr. Northrup's sound advice - and there's plenty to be had within!  <br />It's heartening to learn that you're not alone when apparently &quot;little&quot; things like your tastes in entertainment change: for example, I used to enjoy the ROCKY movies, but for a while now I've noticed that I recoil from any violence I see portrayed on the screen (fortunately, I don't have to contend with much in-person violence in my life!)  To have this psycho-emotional change explained as a &quot;rewiring of the brain&quot; is encouraging and supportive, and Dr. Northrup is hopeful in her advice and helpful in all the additional resources she lists at the end of the book.  I understand a LOT more now what's going on in my body and mind and I've a growing appreciation for the changes yet to come.  What's more, I'm inspired to be a LOT more pro-active in taking care of myself through better nutrition and exercise.  <br />When you consider how LITTLE most women learn about menopause from their mothers and other women in the lives, it becomes evident how essential this book is!  My own mother (who's 72) to this day claims that she &quot;sailed right through&quot; menopause with nary a flash or problem.  This has NOT been MY experience, however, and I really needed the information in this book to reassure me I'm not going nuts!  Dr. Northrup has provided a tremendous service to women of the Baby Boom and THE WISDOM OF MENOPAUSE is a GIFT to our health and sanity!	2001-05-10

Because we're so star-struck in America, we tend to be overly impressed with ShowBiz and the people who inhabit that world.  But as charming, determined and persistent a personality Mr. Brillstein may be, he's essentially just a salesman - NOT the creator, but a &quot;dealmaker&quot; of the ShowBiz Old School - and after almost 400 pages, I found he'd worn thin his welcome!  However dramatic it may have been FOR HIM to accompany John Belushi's body back East, or &quot;duke it out&quot; with the Big Boys in corporate takeovers while at Lorimar, the emotions are thinly drawn and shallow in this book.  Brillstein made me less than intrigued with his machinations, unimpressed by his self-aggrandizing spin on events and ultimately unsympathetic to his life challenges.  (His obvious misogyny doesn't help, either - he has no use for women outside of the sack, it appears.) Here's another absurdly fortunate, rich powerful older man feeling sorry for himself because time changes everything?  I'd have hoped he'd have learned to adjust better to the slings and arrows of life by the time he got to his 60s and 70s!<br />This book was distressing to me because I REALLY WANTED to LIKE the guy - but I found I couldn't.  He's kinda ordinary, and once you remove the &quot;famous&quot; names and large amounts of money, his anecdotes are kinda ordinary!  He's not terribly brilliant, sage or extraordinary in any other way than being sublimely LUCKY!  I gave the book 3 stars, because it's certainly not dreck, but for inspiration or insight, I'd advise looking elsewhere!	2001-03-28

For all the help some people get from 12-Step groups, there are many who don't &quot;relate&quot; to the religiousity.  But this book shows that recovery is still possible and worthwhile.  The fact that most of these tales are told by celebrities and artists we KNOW only increases their value.

What this book manages to so ably point out is that every person who has successfully lost weight and kept it off permanently did so from a Big Plan - NOT through the &quot;support&quot; of any group such as Weight Watchers, Overeaters Anonymous or the like.  It was an INDIVIDUAL CHOICE backed up by individual effort and initiative.  The Trimpeys help the reader find that motivation and reinforce the will to recover from binge eating by recognizing and seeing through the Voice of Fatness. While there are no easy answers or magic pills, there IS a rational choice which we can learn to make for ourselves.  By debunking the irrational beliefs surrounding compulsive eating, discarding worthless theories about the origins of our problems, and directly confronting that internal voice masquerading as our own mind we can triumph over the whole kit and kaboodle.	2001-01-28

Jeffrey Schaler lays out a different paradigm for addiction recovery in this book, holding alcoholics and addicts responsible for their own choices, which is refreshing and empowering.  While taking on the AMA and other forces with financial agendas is risky, Dr. Schaler courageously cuts through the baloney and &quot;tells it like it is&quot;.  His bibliography is comprehensive and a compelling case is made for abandoning current treatment menthods.  <br />For those people with substance abuse problems who cannot buy into the &quot;disease model&quot; promoted by AA and most recovery institutions, this book is welcome relief!  To be held accountable for one's own actions (as any OTHER adult is in this society!) is a GOOD thing!  While AA may be helping some people recover, there are plenty more who don't &quot;resonate&quot; with AA teachings and beliefs, and for addicts and alcoholics to reclaim the power to abstain, after professing &quot;powerlessness&quot; in 12-Step meetings, is a blessing indeed!	2001-01-28

This book is SO well-written and moving - You may not agree with every hypothesis she presents, but you will definitely FEEL happy to be human as a result of reading this book!	2000-10-28

Nick Bunick dresses up some fundamental truths in Angel'sclothes, which is all well and good as far as it goes: we all couldstand to &quot;release our anger and hatred and turn it over to God -and dismiss the unloving, disruptive passengers from our journeythrough life&quot; - but his tone is so patronizing that I foundmyself turned off.  It may not be necessary to believe that Nick isthe reincarnation of the Apostle Paul, as he states - but if you DON'Tbuy into it, then why should he have any more credibility than JoeBlow down the street?  Some readers might get something useful fromsearching for evidence of angels and God's love through the numbers&quot;444&quot; - but this strikes me as being as superstitious asthose who fear &quot;666&quot; as Satan's sign!? After visiting hiswebsite ... - There are a lot more substantial messages and messengersthan this in the spiritual world!!	2000-10-28

Abbie Hoffman was an inspiration to a generation - and a darn good writer, to boot!!  The original tradebook size publication was a LOT easier to decipher than this smaller sized printing - but all the tricks and treats are still there, i.e.: &quot;those ridiculous free introductory or subscription type letters that you get in the mail often have a postage guaranteed return postcard for your convenience.  The next one you get, paste it on a brick and drop it in the mailbox.  The company is required by law to pay the postage.  You can also get rid of all your garbage this way.&quot;  The attitude is refreshing - even now, after all these years!!	2000-10-28

David Craig breaks down the sometimes overwhelming task/joy of performing songs into manageable chunks.  His analysis of songs at the beginning of the book is priceless.  After determining the Who-what why-when-where-how facts, the singer is guided through creating a subtext that personalizes and animates the performance, making it truly something worth watching/hearing.  Highly recommended to singers of all genres, although Mr. Craig's focus is on musical theater.  Answers the eternal question, &quot;is this song (trip) necessary?&quot; with a resounding &quot;YES!&quot;	2000-10-28

The fact that these photos were taken over 50 years and all over the globe is inspiring and humbling at the same time.  I would have given it 5 stars but it's not edited concisely enough to REALLY have a consistent point of view.  Sometimes &quot;more&quot; is NOT necessarily &quot;better&quot;!!	2000-10-28

This is a terrific novel about a man nearly everyone fears and/or hates, and yet ALL reap great benefits from being around him.  His intelligence, anger and frustration  are something to behold - and the storyline weaves through, then ties up in  a MOST satisfying manner - kinda like PULP FICTION circa 1967.  Mr. Reilly  champions and personifies the curmudgeon in all of us - a MUST-READ!	2000-06-24

After reading and dismissing this book a year ago, I read all the reviews and testimonials posted here and decided to give it another look.  But no matter HOW many friends and relatives write to laud this book, the truth is  that it offers no new insight or guidance for those seeking relief from  their obsessions with eating, starving, OR compulsive overeating. The  author offers the same old platitudes about &quot;enjoying the  moment&quot;, but  what good does that do?  It's an empty book, full of  ephemeral promises and platitudes but nothing solid to build on or learn  from. Save your money and your time - you don't need THIS claptrap!	2000-06-16

Jason doesn't sugarcoat  anything about the music biz - but he keeps the joy and enthusiasm and LOVE  for music intact as he tells what worked for him, what DIDN'T work - and  why!  You won't find a more honest and revealing look at what it takes to  be a hit songwriter today.	2000-06-13

Jack Perricone is a great admirer (and practitioner!) of the pop song, and in this book he outlines successful strategies for songwriters to get back IN the groove, or to break OUT of their writing &quot;ruts&quot;.  Granted,  this material may seem rather &quot;heady&quot; at times, and less  intuitive than we like to think creativity is, but when you need a  jumpstart to get back on track, you'll be glad to have this assortment of  options at hand.  Although this book is nominally about Melody only, the  author includes all other song components as they interact, and provides a  fresh perspective and analysis on how and why certain songs reach us and  connect with the public.  There's as much respect shown toward rock and  blues songs as more traditional pop, and a lot of very valuable stuff for  writers of ALL styles of songs.	2000-06-13

While this book handles some issues that Atkins doesn't address - such as AMOUNTS of food and calories ultimately mattering - it's too demanding of the non-bodybuilding dieter, who may not be measuring each gram of fat,  protein and carb with such detail.  The tone of this book assumes the  dieter has complete self-control and no emotional issues when it comes to  food - and can make shifts in carb/fat/protein balance in his or her diet  with no difficulties or resistance!  This may be helpful to athletes who  want to develop a certain physique - in my opinion, it's pretty useless  information to those of us who are just trying to eat healthier and lose  some weight!  Better to stick with Atkins - a lot better written, and much  less expensive!	1999-12-26
