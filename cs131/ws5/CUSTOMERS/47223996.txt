D. 1250	Books	2	30	42	N	N	Too much info leads to distortion of Aristotle	Sr. Prudence Allen provides a broad study of the philosophy of sex identity from the beginnings of philosophy until 1250 AD. The study argues that over the centuries, three basic ways of viewing the relationship between the genders has emerged; viz., sex unity, sex polarity, and sex complementarity. Her thesis is that Aristotelian philosophy, which held to sexual polarity, became ingrained in Western thought as a result of Aristotle's texts becoming required reading in 1255 at the University of Paris. This Aristotelian \\"revolution\\" is responsible for the ethos of male dominance that has permeated the West.<br /><br />Yet Allen's thesis exceeds the evidence by both overlooking some complementary aspects of Aristotle's thought while misunderstanding and/or exaggerating others.<br /><br />The first problem is Allen's categorization of the sexual categories themselves. The distinction between polarity vs. complementarity does not seem to be an exhaustive or useful one. Why? Complementarity presupposes some polarity; it presupposes that there is a lack in one thing in which an excellence of another thing can fulfill it. In other words in order for there to be complementarity there must be polarity - that is, a difference where one is superior to the other, at least in some respect, before there can be an completion of what is lacking, and because of this faulty categorization, the \\"polarity\\" side of Aristotle's thought is exaggerated to the detriment of his \\"complementary\\" side in order to make him \\"fit\\" into the polarity position.<br /><br />The second red flag that will manifest to the alert reader is an apparent bias against Aristotle. She is quick to attribute to the father of logic the most basic of informal fallacies. Without any effort at alternative reconciliations, Aristotle is often said to have been \\"begging the question\\" at the drop of a hat. Moreover, Allen's depiction of Aristotle's thought and its consequences poison the well by being permeated with loaded language. To take some examples, Aristotle thinks men and women are involved in a \\"mutual hostility\\" and \\"he concluded that male and female are opposite in a hostile way\\" ,  giving \\"sex polarity the power to eventually dominate all of western philosophy\\",  etc. This phraseology gives the mistaken impression that Aristotle sees the genders as locked in a sort of war of ongoing antagonism. But Aristotle did not view men and women in combat, but quite the opposite speaks of the \\"natural friendship between man and woman.<br /><br />Finally, Allen overlooks the complementary nature of the Aristotelian form/matter composition and its analogous application to men and women. Nothing is more complementary for Aristotle than form and matter, they go together tighter than peanut butter and jelly or white on rice.<br /><br />In the end, Allen is too quick to attribute complementarity to Hildegard of Bingen - she should have accorded more credit to Aristotle.ed with loaded language.

Garrigou-Lagrange is very thorough in his Thomistic presentation of Mary the Mother of God. Her dignity as God's greatest creature, surpassing all the angels, is rigorously defended from her Divine Maternity. From this starting point the other Marian doctrines are explained and defended, conceived without sin, the Assumption into heaven, etc.<br />GL covers the key points in Mary's life that were catylysts in her receiving even further grace, which she without any sin, would not impede. Every charitable act that Mary did was worthy of all merit possible, from the daily kiss on the forehead of the child Jesus to her co-suffering in Christ's passion. As the Mother of God, Mary is described by Lagrange as having &quot;supplicant omnipotence&quot; (she gets what she asks for). How could a soul that constantly pleaded for her intercession be lost? As Trent noted, devotion to the Mary is a sign of predestination.<br />Read this and you will be unable to walk away without an increased appreciation for our Blessed Mother.	2004-04-14

While not a large book by any means, it is packed with information that is very valuable for one trying to understand the ethical principles of Aquinas. McInerny discusses natural law and the alleged \\"naturalistic fallacy\\", the difference between real and apparent goods, the notion of the Ultimate End as argued by Aristotle and Aquinas, the Thomistic structure of the human act (a series of will-acts of both the order of intention and the order of execution)the role of ignorance in human action, the Cardinal Virtues, and finally how conscience plays into all of the above (a conscience always binds but doesn't always excuse).<br />I have read this book over three times and find it very profitable. Having read this work first, I discovered that when I picked up Aquinas' Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics, I was a \\"leg up\\" on the material and felt as if McInerny's work prepared me for it very well -  as it summarizes the Nicomachean Ethics very nicely.	2003-07-25

The distinctions Adler offers here are timeless and crucial. The answer to this question of the difference in man and animals is neither purely scientific, nor purely philosophical; rather a combined approach is needed. The relevant question to be answered is \\"Does man differ from the rest of the animal kingdom by degree or by kind, and if by kind is this difference radical or superficial?\\" Adler, using a traditional Aristotelian and Thomistic analysis of the modern research while combining it with the more recent positions of other philosophers and scientists, concludes that it is a difference in kind and that this difference is indeed radical. Man is a different \\"kind\\" of thing than the other creatures that inhabit our planet.<br />Adler is indeed fair and objective throughout. We must look at the operation of the creature in question, and in this case - articulation indicates what a given creature does in fact \\"know\\". The argument for difference in kind turns on man's ability to articulate \\"designators\\", that is verbalized concepts in both their connotative and denotative form. There is no evidence that animal communication is expressive in this way. The data that has resulted from inquiring into animal intelligence suggests no more than an ability of perceptual abstraction, whether memorized or immediate. Mankind articulates designators and these articulations cannot be explained by mere sense perception or any perceptual generalization for the very fact that such designators are inherently non - perceptible. Not only does man attribute and recognize particulars as members of abstract classes or the classes themselves, he has the additional ability to express concepts that are not empirically observable at all; i.e. \\"God\\", logical relations such as \\"inference\\", pi, etc. Thus, the negative edge of Ockham's razor prevents us from attributing conceptual awareness on the part of animals yet the positive edge of this principle of parsimony demands such additional attribution to mankind.<br />Next, Adler, using a traditional argument from Aquinas and Aristotle, argues that this ability must be immaterial due to the immaterial nature of the concept - a \\"class\\" or \\"universal\\" that cannot by definition be material and hence not merely an act of the physical brain.<br />Adler is fair throughout his contention. As an example he admits that his immateriality position would be falsified by a \\"Turing machine\\" a computer robot that would be able to communicate with humans via propositional words and sentence formation. This is the third prong of the \\"Cartesian Challenge\\" as asserted by Rene Descartes centuries ago. If a purely physical machine can achieve conceptual thought and propositional language, then Adler admits his immateriality theory on which conceptual thought is based would be falsified.<br />The benefits of this work go far beyond the main issue of human/animal distinction. The bibliography is outstanding. The footnotes are insightful and nearly comprise a second work on their own. Peripheral issues such as theories of human knowledge ala Locke, Kant, and the Aristotelian \\"triadic\\" relation of words - concepts - object are explained here along with a lucid discussion of \\"intention\\" and \\"meaning\\". Most importantly, the final chapter illustrates why such a discussion on the distinction between man and animal is important highlighting the relevant moral and theological questions that are implicated by the results.ceptual awareness on the part of animals yet the positive edge of this principle of parsimony demands such additional attribution to mankind.<br />Next, Adler, using a traditional argument from Aquinas and Aristotle, argues that this ability must be immaterial due to the immaterial nature of the concept - a \\"class\\" or \\"universal\\" that cannot by definition be material and hence not merely an act of the physical brain.<br />Adler is fair throughout his contention.

The chapter on human rights is worth the cost of the book itself, as the west is in dire need of a sound notion of human rights and ought to jettison the ilusory notions of such as promulgated and derived from the philosophies of Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau.<br />It is no surprise that Maritain played a significant role in drafting a charter on human rights with the United Nations.

I have read several books on the Natural Law, some very good ones, but they all left me with a feeling of incompleteness. Maritain does not do this, he fills the gap here and covers an immense amount of ground in such a short space. Worthy of special mention is the relationship of human rights to the Natural Law and how rights must be founded on it - for without Natural Law there is no true obligation.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the moral and political applications of Natural Law.	2002-10-26

Persons are self-determining creatures and should never be treated as mere objects. This is a fantastic book that beautifully displays Wojtyla's view of the dignity of the human person and the sacredness of the sexual act.<br />Worthy of special mention is Wotyla's metaphysical analysis of \\"love\\". This is a deep look into the nature of true love, how the sexual urge is the starting point, a good thing that encourages us to look deeper and to love the person as a whole. When this urge is abused by treating the person as a mere sex object, the fruits of the sexual urge are squandered. When used properly, the sexual urge is fuel to deepen our interests in another, to develop a friendship, goodwill, and if there is reciprocity from the other person, the highest stage is attained - betrothed love - the lifelong comittment of marriage.<br />This is a book that is sorely needed by our society today. There is much here - Wojtyla's thought is rich and deep. You will not get the grasp of his point with one reading, rather it will take multiple readings of this book for its flavor to sink in. Personally I have read this book three times and can testify how it has enriched my life. I think it will do the same for you.	2002-04-03

Included is a critique of the moral theory known as \\"consequentialism\\", a rebuttal of the famous \\"violinist argument\\", and a host of other very useful information.<br />This is one of the top books on the market regarding presenting a persuasive rational argument for the prolife view.	2002-03-21

His explanation of difficult philosophical and theological concepts (i.e. the Trinity) is done in a manner that can be easily understood by those with less expertise in these areas. This book is really a valuable piece, and should be on the bookshelves and in the minds of all Catholics.	2001-02-27

Fr Clarke explains the principles of Thomas' thought in an easy to understand fashion and then convincingly applies them to modern thought. What is especially important in this work is Clarkes development of St Thomas' idea of being as a &quot;substance in relation&quot; which be defintion has a communicative value. This theme is stressed often in the book and is useful in having a response to skeptics of knowledge about the material world. Fr Clarke also gives compelling modern versions of Thomas' 5 Ways of arguing for the existence of God. Well done.	2000-12-27

The beginning chapters start off rather well, but then the book goes downhill. Unfortunately this book explains things only very briefly and then gives you pages and pages of XML code to read over. These long pages of code are confusing to someone who needs to learn XML in the first place. I would look elsewhere for a beginning book.	2000-12-20
