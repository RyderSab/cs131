Having read several, I dove into \\"Nest of Sparrows\\" without trepidation.  I was wise as this is a very enjoyable, balanced, tale of Wade, a young man left with three children of his departed fiance's.  Gladly he accepts them, though life is harried and crazed at the beginning.  Just when they are all settling in a surprise visitor comes knocking.....the children's biological father!  What ensues takes the reader through gambits of emotions as conversations, similes, adjectives, adverbs are so well written the pursuer cannot help but be affected.  The infusion of Hope is paramount, making this read uplifting even though the premise is very deep.  \\"Nest of Sparrows\\" combines all that is good about storytelling; reading this book is an experience you don't want to miss. <br />	2004-08-29

As a huge fan of Haruf, this title seemed more in keeping with &quot;Where He Once Belonged&quot; and &quot;The Tides That Bind&quot; in it's less than perfect characterizations.  Some of &quot;Eventide's&quot; personalaties border on pathetic, but is it not that way in life?  In my 49 years of living in small towns in Montana and Wyoming, I certainly have met them all. Haruf does offer us hope through the &quot;McPheron's&quot; &quot;Victoria and Katie,&quot; &quot;Rose Tyler,&quot; and others that stumble, rising again from their self-inflicted ashes.  That we must reside among the unreedemable is truth.  The idiom that &quot;truth hurts&quot; applies here, but truth also educates, affects change, and defuncts one's prejudices and judgements.  I cried often thoughtout, but I also questioned, pondered, and meditated.  Bravo, to Mr. Haruf for daring to tear we readers from our comfort zones, urging  compassion, understanding, and in some instances, action.  Bravo, that through these characters we may affect change in our lives and those around us, rather than residing in our complacent ignorance.  Bravo, that Mr. Haruf dared to challenge; in challenge, only, can we meet victory. <br />Bravo, bravo, bravo!	2004-06-05

In \\"Prince of Lost Places\\" she demonstrates her engrossing creativity in such a way that laying the book aside is an impossibility.  I followed Martha, a poor mother scared of the violence of the world, as she flees to a cave to protect her son.  I read knowing all was not what it seemed, guessing at clues, never quite sure of reality until the last page....and even then?  The phrasing is so beautiful at times you must read and re-read to drink it in to your heightened senses.  The adventure is so vividly conjectured your heart beats mercilessly.  The supense is so thick it is palatable as you gulp it into your frenzied lungs.  This is another masterpiece, a habit Hepinstall has accomplished in her three attempts.  I know Hollywood will come calling for this exotic script and I wish her all the success she so rightfully deserves.  EXCELLENT JOB, INDEED!!!	2003-02-20

As a biblophile, I seldom waste my time on celebrity tell-alls that relate who they slept with and where it got them.  However, I wanted Rosie's book because she promised she didn't do that.  She kept her word, and what enfolds in this gripping tale captivated my interest.  She writes with heart, raw truth that bleeds, self-depricating humor, and proseful ability.  I related so deeply to this book, as I too had a childhood from hell, and have wondered why I survived while others didn't?  Her poignancy in sharing her behaviors had me crying and nodding, and the bizzare experience that awakens her self-analysis is harrowing, but intriguing.  I loved this book.  I hope she writes more, even fiction, because the talent is there.<br />I read that professional reviewers thought she should have written more about her sex life?  My response.....Get a life, Pro-Reviewers!  The points made here will help so many and her sex life is her own business!!!!!!! Thank-you Rosie for sharing what was important, and sparing us the rest.	2002-05-21

It is an edge of your seat read that keeps you guessing until the last page is turned.<br />Ms. Gardner is a first time writer, and I was very impressed with the skill of her prose.

The threads of it's beginning pattern complect a tapestry by end.  I was mesmerized by each tale; completely given over to the surreal quality that melded into perfect rhyme.  It is not an easy read, but is life an easy road?  Isn't the trip the joy?  It is in this transmigration of spirit and pulp.<br />A beautiful work of art; that books could be displayed in museums, this would hang in reverence.<br />This is a read.

I count on her stories to introduce me to vibrant, eccentric, loveable characters.  Also, I count on coming away refreshed and enlightened.  &quot;Dinner At The Homesick Restaurant&quot; left me with an upset stomach.  The Tull family, though fitting the eccentric characteristics, are  more morose and unlikeable than any Tyler family I have read prior.  Only one seemed tolerable, and he was a pathetic, lonely soul.  BUT...Anne Tyler did not shirk her writing duties.  All her strong suits of descriptions, dialogue, character developement, flowing prose are intact.  The only reason it rated a 4 was for the unsympathetic characters that haunted me well after the read.  I believe good writing and Anne Tyler are synonymous, so don't skip this offering.  Just be aware it is more maudlin than most.	2001-11-05

The style of &quot;Disappearing Into View&quot; veers completely from sweet innocence into the grit and grime of the Boston underworld.  Subject matters revealed are dark, disturbing fare, gripping the reader in a vice of suspense.  Mr. Stone utilizes flashbacks to arouse suspicion, assuring pages flip in rapid succession.  Questions of why, what, and how lie in taunting wait.  Most impressively, Stone's caliber of writing has flourished. His provoking similies, developement of rich characters, realistic dialogue, and philosophical idioms, pinnacle the advancement of his talents.<br />Warning....this is not light fare; the topics scream and violence ignites.  However, crafted by this deft writer , the expose' is a must read.  Absolutely superb!!!	2001-11-05

Knowledge is found, along with a lovely woman and her young son. Leo marries Jeanne displacing she and Adam to his home in Canada, leaving behind Adam's father. Now, 15 years later, in an act of protection, Leo feels he must anonymously meet the &quot;other&quot; father, prior to Adam doing so. The poignant trip back to Ashland conjurs sentimental memories memorialized beautifully by the prose of Terence Green. As his passenger, the reader delves into cobwebbed rememberances of drive-ins, childhood mayhem, and life's non predictiability. You are never disappointed in Leo's sidetrips....the magical moments lie there in quivering wait.<br />Terence Green is one of my top ten favorite male authors. This is a vast compliment, as I am somone who has read thousands of books, multiple genres, bevy of writers. His simple, quiet, sentimental style mesmerizes my eyes and heart to each page; each circumstance; each emotion. That he grips his reader san gratuitous violence and sex, multiple plot twists, or grapic language is a tribute to his abilities. There is romance, there are debacles, there are twists of thought, and there is language, but all are subtle, precise, palatable, and genuine.<br />&quot;St Patrick's Bed&quot; is a love song to rituals past and present; to memories enjoyed or endured; to choices desired or willed. It chants of love in all it's forms, and the music sings to each reader's soul.  It is a gift to you.  I would advice splurging!	2001-10-29

What an inspiring story of a woman beating insurmountable odds to be a spokesperson for the rights of victims.  The details of the espisodes were cleverly interwined into a story that reads like good flowing fiction, keeping one riveted to the page.  All sides of the issues are well presented.  Though the brutal crimes of Rusty Woomer could have left one despising him, hearing his side and learning his coversion to Christianity gave him a humanness relatable to the reader.

Maud, her best friend, fights a lack of crippling self esteem with tragic results, yet has redeeming and lovely atrributes to educate the reader.

In this case it is 53 year old Rebecca Davitich, struggling through a midlife crisis while dealing with a circus of eccentric family memebers .  What she discovers on this peregrition is relatable  to all who face the second half of their lives.  It is deeply moving and uproariously funny all on the same page.  Tyler is a magician with dialogue, keeping it slightly off kilter to the norm, but always believable and charming. At some point in the book you forget you are reading, transcending paper and space to  join Rebecca in her pursuits, her worries, her dilemmas, and her solutions.  She isn't a character anymore; she is a best friend and you are rooting for her all the way.<br />Anne Tyler is on my top 5 list of all time women author's deservedly, with this book providing the evidence of why.

The story of Sam's struggle to live through a divorce, is deftly handled in this story.. The deep well of emotions are explored with a careful scalpel of Berg's insightful precision, opening all wounds to the healing process. Perhaps some will say it was too predictable, but I think not. People do survive divorce after mourning the death of marriage....they struggle forward, take a step back, and two more forward.

We meet a variety of flawed but forging characters; his mother Arlene struggling to stay afloat and sober; a geography teacher scarred by wounds inside and out from Vietnam, and a multitude of others who play into the well designed plot.

And for good reason; Sawyer is lying dead on an abandoned street, the apparent victim of cardiac arrest. Two days later Judd Webster dies of the same malady, and a day later Eileen Matthews befalls the exact fate. Who is next? Why are all these seemingly healthy people dying of suspicious heart failure? Who in this group is the next to die? And who is decimating these associates one by one? The FBI's suspicions mount when small bullet wounds are discovered in each corpse. Unfortunately, their field agent sent to decipher the unexplained contusions becomes the next victim. Now anal retentive, fear-riddled Dr. Mort must search for answers. With the aid of loving Millie, the duo hunt clues to these mysterious deaths, endangering their own lives in the pursuit.

The story is character driven, speeding at 100 mph, swerving dangerously, crossing lanes without thought to safety. You may want to swerve away, but you cannot!!! You are pinned into this experience, sensing the probable drastic outcome. What will happen? Will tragedy be averted? Will all collide into carnal wreckage? Dubus is masterful at keeping you so attached to the imperfect trio, your eyes accelerate across the words, while your trembling fingers flip pages. The prose is as powerful as dynamite, yet as fragile as a butterfly wing. Read this book, and witness a novel of aggregated impeccability.	2001-08-28

It is articulate; witty; brazen; reflective; sharp; explicatory and perfectly readable.<br />The saga of Ruth, Ted, Marion and Eddie sweeps across the pages like blustering wind at times, and like a gentle breeze at others.  The characters are so entrenched in the reader's psyche, they elevate to close friends early in.  What occurs in their day by day struggles becomes essential fodder for the reader's ever increasing interest.  The prose is written lyrically, the descriptions keen, and sex scenes  richy erotic; the characters are defined intimately defying complacency.<br />To say John Iriving is genius is to say black is dark........he is beyond description.  The man writes a story that lives within the reader's soul for seasons.  John Irving is a master craftsman.	2001-08-13

At age 22, give or take, Taylor begins a migration in a beat-up Volkswagon Bug to find her destiny.....her destiny being a 3 year old child named Turtle, thrust upon her by a Cherokee Indian woman in Oklahoma, and a a tire store in Tuscon, Arizona.  Turtle is nearly catatonic when Taylor receives her, and the story of Turtle's and Taylor's developement in Arizona is the crux of this page-turning read.  A cast of eccentric, but loveable characters enter their lives, surrounding them with color and flavor.  Much more humorous and light than &quot;Posionwood Bible,&quot; Barbara Kingsolver proves herself a most versitile writer with a penchant for grabbing her audience and not letting go. I laughed; I cried; I emoted varied emotions and fell deeply in like with this misfit cast of characters.  A wonderful, enjoyable read.	2001-08-05

Dorfman is mysteriously ill, resorting to every form of healing available.  In his pursuits lie some of the funniest moments in this read, and I found myself guffawing aloud till my stomach hurt.  However, there is a great deal of poignancy as well as Dorfman searches the archives of his life for clues....an obsessive complusive father with a medical liscence; an emotionally detached mother; a tragedy that befalls the family and destroys continuity and faith.  Still, the humor never fades and keeps you turning pages for more.  Just a delightful, entertaining, interesting read that I highly recommend.	2001-08-02

However, Elizabeth Berg's prose creates a most insightful tale that touches the very heart strings of the reader.  It is witty.  It is gritty. It is prolific.  It is truthful without too much clinical detail.  Mostly, it is loving.  The loving friendship of two friends, bound together through thick and thin.  A wise story, the book leaves you uplifted even with the inevitable ending.  Yes, tears spilled from my eyes, but they were in profound respect for Berg's well written characters, and the exquisite beauty of her words.  I was so genuinely moved by this read, I wrote my dearest friend an email emoting how much I loved her.  Well done prose affects it's readers, and that, to me, is the crux of good writing.

Troncoso bares all with eloquence and dignity and the stories compell the reader to their pages.  My only regret is I am not more prolific in Spanish, but it did not deter my fervor for these mini-masterpieces.

Having read many female friendships, this book helped me realize that though inherently different in the traditions of expressing friendship, male bonds indeed run deep. Stone has written with crispness, truth, raw emotion, gentility, commanding force, and open honesty. Early on, you are willingly drawn into the lives of Keith, a writer in angst, and Phiz, a dedicated musician drawn to rock and roll. As though transported, the pages vanish, and you are one with these two, walking, talking, emoting and excepting emotions as your own. The walk is not bumpless; the ride is not calm. The truths uncovered are not always pretty, but the read remains assuring and alluring. Brilliant in it's simplicity, it does not need blood and gore, or abject horror to keep your interest. You read because you relate on a gut level, and you care about the successes and the trevails of each man.<br />Women, do not shy away because it is the friendship of men. Men know you have found your voice through Andrew Stone. This book appeals on all levels to both sexes. Gift yourself with this exemplary read; you will be richly rewarded for your efforts.	2001-07-12

Cleverly, the credence of each of these ladies to one another is discovered as the highly original plot unfolds.  Lyrical prose and an exceptionally inventive format, make this a deseserved Pulitzer winner.

Never clique. Never trite.  Milton's bag of tricks mixes murder, prison, the grime of the underbelly, with passion, profundity, and macabre humor.  Paul, the protaginist is a grittier version of James Garner's &quot;Rockford&quot; and Robert Mitchum's &quot;Phillip Marlowe,&quot; sharing his adventures in the first person. The dialogue rings true, the plot progression remains tight, and the prose is prolific at times.<br />Take this roller coaster ride; be lured into the calm of the approach, then hurled, whirled, spinning down and around surprise twists and chilling turns, never, ever guessing how it will end, till it does.	2001-07-03

As a precusor to reading, &quot;The Hours&quot; by Michael Cunningham which pays homage to this book, I read &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot;  The novel is quite breathy, long in sentence and vocabulary.  Since I have learned of Woolf's diagnosis of manic depression, I realize her style of writing proves that out.  At times, you want to beg for periods,and finished thoughts.  The characters are rich, though somewhat trite, with Septimus being the exception.  I would recommend reading this and then the brilliant tribute novel, &quot;The Hours.&quot;  Neither is quite complete without the other.	2001-07-02

Hannah's writing is rather good, not sappy and unbelievable. The plot was reasonable and the characters very reader friendly. For a day I was wisked to my favorite state in the Union, Washington, and the rain forests I adore. The love triangle of Annie, Blake, and Nick was somewhat predictable, yet cohesive. Looks at more serious matters were also addressed through Izzy, a child ravished by a mother's suicide, and an honest attempt to address bipolar illness. Though wanting, Hannah does breach the issue and makes a brave attempt. All in all, it kept me interested and I even cried at some of the sentiment. That says alot for the decency of the writing. Though I could never linger in this fanciful genre often, it was enjoyable on a hot summer day. It is a beach book; a hammock book; a let me just forget all the tragedy around me book. Sometimes the violence of our culture makes a book like this needed and Hannah rose nicely to the task. Pure pleasurable escapism.	2001-06-11

I was so impressed by the writing style, a tribute to the hills of Kentucky.  Descriptions so complete that I smelled the flowers perched on the mountain valleys and saw their splendor.  I was in awe of the novel approach Ms. Rubio presents in letting us inside the head of someone suffering Tourette Syndrome.  Magnificant detail in the inner workings of the body before a sufferer breaks forth into an attack.<br />The story flowed, the characters were brilliantly written, the plot new and fresh; this is an enchanting read that you won't regret investing time in.	2001-05-20

Various theories arise on the aspect of time and you are coaxed with lovely writing to ponder those theories.  I found myself smiling at some, relating deeply to others, and finding my sense of time among the pages.  Various chapters reminded me of movies I had seen; &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; and Peggy Sue Got Married,&quot; and &quot;Sliding Doors.&quot;  Alan Lightman must not be the first to ponder the thoughts of Einstein's dreams.<br />Though it was unique and beautifully written, I cannot say, &quot;Everyone buy this; you must.&quot;  The prose is striking; the thoughts presented interesting; I just didn't happen to find it a great use of my reading time, and that is time I value above all!!	2001-05-17

Because she has the amazing ability to take, quirky, eccentric, unusual characters, throw them into everyday life, and stir the mix into grand entertainment.  As readers we come to appreciate oddity; not to fear it or judge it.  Humor is paramount to her tales that flow with effortless dialogue and exquisite descriptions.<br />The Peck family is a staple of Baltimore society; their homes are meticulous; their manners impeccable; their views staunch and unchanging; their style set in stone like the identical homes they reside in.  BUT, Duncan and Justine, walking to the beat of different drummers, break away in search of spontaniety.   Their idosyncratic attempts toward this end, make for a most insightful presentation.<br />Don't be afraid.  Meet the Pecks.  You will come to accept and like them warts and all.  This is quite a delightful read!	2001-05-14

I picked this book up with the intention of beginning the read.  12 hours later, my eyes watering from exhaustion and emotion, I replaced it on my library shelf.  Now I miss my friends, Victoria, the homeless unwed mother, Maggie Jones, the helpful teacher, Ike and Bobby, the two boys in search of a mother(I wanted to adopt them), Guthrie, the boy's troubled but loving father, and my favorites, the McPheron's, bachelor brother's with hands of steel and hearts of gold.  I adopted these people because Kent Haruf's simple, but brilliant style invites this union.  These fictitious yet believalbe folks of Holt, Nebraska will live in my mind and heart for decades.<br />My one wish......write a sequel, Kent, and let all of us who adored this book follow on in the lives of these simple, flawed, reedemable characters.<br />Both this book and &quot;The Tie That Binds&quot; grabbed me at the first sentence and never let me go.  Only brilliant writing can do that.  Gift yourself with this read....from the picturesque cover to the last word, you will be entralled.  And I dare to make this prediciton as well....your insights into human nature will be richer and more optimistic for the read.	2001-05-09

Ana Suarez's writing is like symphonic music.  The poetic verse is brilliant.  The story, a child born with severe handicaps, and the three women who fight to see him through his short, but meaningful journey, captures your heart and never lets it go.  I have a dear friends who went through a very similar situation with the birth of their son, and having been with them, watching the joy and the agony combine in a universal way to teach us all, I commend, Ms. Suarez on capturing this situation perfectly.  This is truly beautiful writing with such quality of depth.  An emotional but transforming read!	2001-05-03

It will, however, amuse you with  it's enjoyable story line about upper class blacks grappling  with romance, finance, and guilt.  Moving at a clip pace, it only briefly offers insights into the psyche of each character.

Set in rural Georgia in the 1940's, the tale is rich with eccentric characters who &quot;guaren-damn-tee&quot; to provoke empassioned feelings.  The dialogue is sharp.  The plot trenchant.  Humor, racial tension, and suspense drive this story along like a raft on a ever-winding river.  Each twist and turn swirls the story into unexpected surprises, and rafts the reader over waterfalls of human frailities and outlandish behaviors.    <br />Terry Kay style is a blend of Mark Twain and William Faulkner; his writing is that clever, that diverse, that colorful.  I applaud his masterful abilities, and encourage all lovers of southern fiction to pick up this vivid, delightful, insightful page turning tale.  This is most definitely a MUST READ!!	2001-04-21

It is lyrical prose mourning the loss of Kincaid's brother from AIDS, and in a greater sense the loss of her childhood stolen by a demanding mother, ill father, and half-brothers who drained the family provisions.  My eyes were opened to abject proverty that I, as an American, know so little about.  Antigua is so improverished the hospital is just a holding place for death.  Only through Jamaica's efforts, is her brother afforded any medications.  The story is poignant and expressive.  Perhaps, because it reads like a mourning journal, I never felt comfortable reading it, and was relieved to complete this short novel.  Not my favorite book, but worth reading, not the least reason being education.	2001-04-17

The eccentric tale is an adult fable and an allegory wrappped together in lyrical prose that flows with the power of a raging river at times, and a soothing babbling creek at other's.  The mythical, yet marred, characters leave their imprint on your soul as you become entrenched in their personalities......judging one moment; forgiving the next.

True to her style, her characters are  eccentric, endearing, flawed but loveable, and captivating.

As the reader, you are off on a journey with Joan, &quot;a &quot;mere woman,&quot; scorned by her society.  Her excursion is packed full of ingredients for superb drama; a brutal childhood, cunning deception, grisly wars, feasts and famines, intelligent scheming, treacherous brawn, and an enchanting love story.   Cross does an excellent job of keeping the reader entrenched in the action, allowing rest only in intimate moments.  I can see this book made into a sweeping epic akin to &quot;Cleoprata&quot; or &quot;Ben Hur.&quot;<br />Read this book for the fiction, but realize while doing so, you amass factual accounts of 800 B.C. culture that is engrossing.

Being a voracious reader of fiction for the past 40 years, I do not know how I missed this masterpiece of literature till now.

Justification for this statement comes because  I  have read  thousands of books, from &quot;the greats,&quot; to the cult writers with  their mass following.  This was beyond a &quot;good read.&quot;  It  was a  journey into life at it's rawest and hope at it's most refined.  Seldom  does a book haunt me days after the reading but Astrid's journey is not  easily shelved.   Ms. Fitch delivers 390 pages of  riveting descriptions,  enlightened similies, and precise character developement creating  unforgettable prose.  That this is a first attempt; that the writing is so  acutely pointed;  that Astrid lingers indefintely in the reader's  conscience is remarkable.  &quot;White Oleander&quot; is a gift to all book  lovers who long for stories to engross, touch, and change them.   If Ms.  Fitch does not receive book awards for this masterpiece, than I will no  longer put credence into Pulitzer's and National Book Award's as barometers  to excellence.

I am not given to reading Hollywood autobiorgraphies, but after a very prominent interviewer gushed over this book with stirring accolades, I acquiesced.  498 pages later of endless ramblings, Im angry for not going with my gut instincts.  There is no defined beginning, middle or end, just non-stop viewpoints and antedotes  that are poorly written.  The one constant; self-pity!. <br /> <BR> Mr. Fonda begins his book with a disclaimer on the use of drugs and yet gleefully shares with his readers the wonders of his usage of  mind altering drugs from   puberty to present..  He bemoans the lonely, distant relationship he had with his father, and yet subjects his children to the same.  It is a book of constant hypocrisies that insult the intelligence and the sensibility of the reader.  Fonda seems proud of his angry, embittered image and regales the reader with language befitting a drunken sailor. <br /> <BR> Endless chapters are devoted to the forgetable movies in Fonda's repertoire, discussing camera angles, location problems, stars egos and habitual drug rituals.  Even &quot;Easy Rider&quot; is discussed so profusely that it's magic is lost forever.  One or two chapters would have been ample on these subjects. <br /> <BR> Throughout the book, we  journey with Peter in search of the love he felt deprived of as a child.  We are subjected to countless sexual encounters described with much zeal by Fonda.  Only so many bed romps are interesting and then it becomes rote and a matter of &quot;belt notching.&quot;    <br /> <BR> So little is explored intellectually with his father or sisters or multiple mothers.  Too much is discussed about drug binges and sex.   In the last chapter, Peter desperately attempts to put rhyme and reason to the story, but it is a case of much too little, much too late.  This book is self-seving, self-absorbed, self-obsessed drival and no reader should waste the hours and efforts to wade through the rubble that is &quot;Dont Tell Dad.&quot;  Let me tell you to easily r!ide by this one at the bookstore.	1998-04-24
