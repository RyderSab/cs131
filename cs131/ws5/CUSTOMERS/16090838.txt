What can I say? If you have read her other novels then you know every book she writes is the bomb. I thought that I would be crying to hard over the ending of Jalin's novels to really get emotionally involved with Kiley, but I was so wrong. Brenda weaves a web of sex, love, hustling, murder, family bonds, and then some in this novel. I truly loved it. Brenda Hampton is the best author out there. Not many authors can write 5 star novels EVERY time. Bravo!!!	2005-08-18

I read the book about 3 weeks ago, and can't remember a whole lot about the book, which says that it couldn't have left a big impression on me. This was a book with good chapters, but predictable and not her best. But as I understand it, this is a remake of her first published book. I do remember having to make myself finish it. This is just o.k. If you enjoy her other books and haven't read this one yet, don't bother. You aren't missing anything. Her best books are written after this one.	2005-04-01

This is a good book. The problem with me is that so many authors are running into the category of read one read them all. I could easily guess in the beginning of the book that she was going to end up liking her man's friend. After reading book after book, I am looking for something I haven't read before. Not a remake of another novel, add a little, subtract a little.  I have just become bored lately, until I read The Preacher's Son. That was a  literary breath of fresh air.  <br /> <br />These street books are original and bring something different to the table: Coldest Winter Ever, B-More Carful, How Can I Be Down, Street Dreams, just to name a few. These were original storylines that knock you off your feet. I am so sick of mediocore readings. In 2005, I am only finishing the great books. I normally finish books just because I started them. The getting by reads are going to the side unless I am bored.	2005-04-01

I have become so bored with all the books that are supposed to be hot lately. This was like a breath of fresh air. Many books I have read lately all have similiar plots...read one, read them all. Well, The Preacher's Son was far from having a storyline we have all read one to many times. Parents always have these expectations of what they want their children to be. But the pressure is ten times harder when your parents are in the public eye like Bishop T.K. Wilson. But their kids are far from saints, the kind that like to get their freak on and don't want to be quoting scriptures all day long. This book was so much fun to read, and it had drama and more drama. Everytime I would try to guess what would happen in the book, I was wrong. None of us are without sin, and this book paints that picture very well. Even the people that SEEM the holiest!! I just love reading books that make me want to put normal things like working, eating, and sleeping on hold. Bravo Carl Weber!	2005-03-22

Lately, I have been the oddball when reviewing some of the books that are SUPPOSED to be so hot. I was not at all impressed with this book. I think this novel was meant to be on a much lighter and serious note. It isn't sex and drama filled as Addicted, Nervous, or the others. I haven't been reading alot of reviews in detail because I don't like to know what is going to happen. Well, I thought Zane's novel should have been more exciting. To be honest, and I hate to say it because I love Zane, I didn't even want to finish it. Zane and Brenda Hampton are my favorite authors, but Afterburn just isn't cutting it!	2005-02-18

I am not sure if I read the same book that all the other reviewers read. I really wanted to love this book, but it wasn't my cup of tea. Before I start the negative, I would like to commend Ms. Wahida Clark on being able to write this book while incarcerated. That is a BIG accomplishment and there are so many who are people feeling her books, so congratulations. I did enjoy the erotic scenes and some of the chapters had some gangsta sh*t going on that was interesting. But for the most part, I was never on the edge of my seat. The story never developed into what I thought the book was about. The three friends in the book didn't seem like they had their own heads on straight, but were supposed to have such \\"high inspirations\\"...please. The pimp portion of the story was garbage. The story didn't have a moral or even a followable storyline to me. One page will talk about one of the girls going to the club, shooting heroine and then the next page she will be a aspiring doctor. It made no sense. Wahida didn't show the girls to be ambitious and doing something with their lives. I just couldn't get into the book. If you want to read some great street books with a real plot and edge of your seat storyline, read \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\", \\"B-More Careful\\", or \\"Street Dreams\\", just to name a few that are better than this crap. I know the majority on this page thinks differently, but so be it. Get it from the library, don't buy it.	2005-02-01

I give it a four because of the principal and the moral to the story. The delivery just wasn't exciting. It's more of a story telling how you feel after someone cheats and the biblical fight to honor your vows. Being that I am engaged, I would hope that I could apply the same biblical principles to my marriage if that was to happen to me. Jasmine, which is Kyla's best friend, is lonely. She has lost her husband, has affairs with married men, has very few friends,and figures she can find happiness if she has Kyla's husband. Jasmine brings the greatest hurt ever to Kyla. Kylas has to decide if she can honor her marriage, or let go because of her husband's mistake. Jasmine also finds out that married men only use you for what you are worth, but really love their wives (hint to all you homewreckers). In the end, you are left lonely. It is a good book.

But I don't understand how this book got so many 5 star ratings. I read the book because of the hype and the ratings. So that disappointed me. I actually started the book and after awhile through it to the side. I always try to finish a book because sometimes they get better and this book did. Five stars is the best a book can be. I only give 5 stars when the book is off the chain from the first word to the last one. I did enjoy the book, but like some of the other readers, it took awhile for me to get into the book. I wanted to do like one of the other readers and skip through some parts to get to the real plot of the story. It just took so long for the story to unfold. The story line is slow and I feel that some parts could have been left out and some others more developed. I have never read a book with this type of storyline so Shonda gets a A for originality, but not for deliverance. Parts of the book is unrealistic to me. I couldn't see anyone waiting like she did for 5 whole years. Then Shonda didn't introduce Jarrin back into the story correctly. It was kind of elementary and silly. After he gave his excuse Yani's response was elementary. Jarrin didn't act as if they had been together for years. He acted like Yani was someone he casually dated. It was to unrealistic. Now Alex, he was a keeper! Alex was any woman's dream. To me it wouldn't be any competiton. The way Shonda created Jarrin's personality didn't make the story believable. Shonda could have drawn that drama out some! In my opinion, where the drama started is where the book ended. It was good for the first book. I do recommend the book, but don't expect to be blown off your feet. <br />	2005-01-06

It was not as original as B-More Careful. And yes it did remind me of Player's Club, but it had its own differences. If you haven't read B-More Careful, please do. It is off the chain!! I was torn between giving the book 3 stars or 4 stars. The book is fast paced with alot of twists and turns. I never got bored with the book and that is the reason I gave it 4 stars. The book is basically about girls that try to make lemonade with the lemons of life. And they do it by stripping. Two girls in particular get up under this girl named Kat, who is [really bad]. I wanted to kick [Kat] myself! Tender and Goldie are basically settling for stripping because they feel like they don't have a choice. The only thing that got me is that some of the things were to stupid and Shannon made Tender and Goldie to gullible. How are they able to buy Gucci glasses, burberry fits, stilettos, for just one outfit and be worried about where to lay thier head? They could afford their own crib. Nobody is that gullible. Then Goldie was to gullible for me at the end of the book. I can't give it away. Read it for yourself. <br />	2005-01-06

First of all, I didn't know that this book was more than just a story about a mother prostituting her child. I was hesitant about picking up this book and, I looked at the ratings and didn't read the actual reviews of this book. So many people give to many details when reviewing the book and it ruins the surprises. I didn't know anything, so the book was just mind blowing! Obviously the book is about Queen Esther taking advantage of her daughter's innocence and prostituting her starting off as a teenager. Queen Esther is the worst kind, who is a lover of money and will get it at ANY cost. She plays on teenagers who has problems and makes them think she is a safe haven when she is a snake, actually destroying their lives. It's surprising what some people will do for a dollar, or should I say feel like they have to do. And Gloria also touches on the mental affect of females selling their bodies. All and all Arnell desperately wants to move on with her life, but Esther has a hold on her. A hold combined with past secrets that she holds over her head, and the confusing feeling of loving her mother in spite of. Queen Esther is a mess! You can't even imagine the things that will unfold in this book. Sometimes I thought Queen Esther was the devil himself. Gloria Mallette did a wonderful job of writing this novel. It is serious, entertaining, and surprisely funny. Queen Esther is such a [...], but some things will have you laughing like I can't beleive she did or said that. Scenes like the funeral, particular sex scenes, and the confrontation at the end of the book will leave your mouth wide open!! Gloria intertwines love, family ties, sex, life lessons, prostitution, humor, murder....you name it, it is in this book. I read Shades of Jade and it is good. But The Honey Well is on another level. Ms. Mallette definetely is da bomb. I will be recommending this book to everyone I know who enjoys reading good black fiction novels. The books description doesn't give you a clue as to what all is in store for you.	2005-01-05

Kiley is left an empire to uphold after his father was killed. While running from a secret of his past life, the reader goes into a life of streets, women, drugs, relationship drama, shiesty friends, true friends, and more. This was a well written novel. It makes the book so much better when you don't have any idea how the novel will unfold (to many readers give stuff away).

I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed in the storyline of the book. There are lots of hot sex scenes, which I enjoyed, but I don't think the writer delivered the story in a way that kept me excited or longing to know what happened next. The writer seemed to jump subjects quick, seeming like she was trying to squeeze some thoughts into this very short novel. It just depends on what type of author's work you are use to reading. I just discovered Brenda Hampton and am reading all her books back to back. So sometimes that can throw a reader off when a new author's skill level doesn't equate to what you are use to. Don't get me wrong, the book is worth reading, but don't expect to have your socks knocked off. If you want to read a book of short stories that are all the bomb, read \\"Around the Way Girls\\".

Nikki Turner did an o.k. job to me. Now if you compare it to The Coldest Winter Ever, it is garbage. But just to read, it will do. I gave the book a 3 which is an average rating. But The Coldest Winter Ever deserves 10 stars! You can tell Nikki is familiar with the streets. Some of the events were funny and real. I was getting ready to say that her being fifteen and all she went through is unrealistic, but it isn't. Plenty of girls fall in love with men that sell drugs and go for the ride of whatever the dope game brings. That is what this book is about. A girl who falls in love with an older drug dealer and what happens in her life when he is locked up. The book is worth reading, but it has a long way to go to reach the level of Sister Souljah's book. <br />	2005-01-05

Carl Weber is very talented. Please read Baby Momma Drama. I am going to read that again. <br />	2005-01-05

From the beginning to the end, it will keep your guessing, laughing, and wanting to read more. I read book, after book, and after reading ADDICTED, just any old book won't do. I get bored. Addicted is not at all predictable. Zane combines sex, love, murder, mystery, family history, etc. into one plot. She is so gifted. As I said, I don't think it gets better than this.	2005-01-05

It is about a female that makes herself belive that she only needs to be involved with married men. She belived that she was getting the big end of the stick by getting the sex and money without the commitment and trouble of maintaining a relationship. I personally believe that people that tell themselves that are lieing to themselves, because everybody wants somebody. Has she finally messed with the wrong woman's man? Does she change her ways? Read and find out. This is a pretty good book. <br />	2005-01-05

This book was entertaining and a good easy read. Its hard to tell about the book without giving to much away. I hate when people give away the book in their reviews! I don't know how Zane took such a simple plot of four employees of Wolfe and made it so interesting and exciting. Zetta is off the chain. Diana can't get trying to get over losing her man years ago, Tomalis is rich and poor at the same time, Chico is seduced by the boss' wife, some employees are trying to sleep their way ahead,.......Like I said, Zane is just bad. It is so much drama leading up to the Christmas party. I am a fan of her erotic stories, but the story is good without the sex. She is so funny,and the story unfolds like you would not believe. I read the book in 2 days. I love when I get a book that I can get into to the point where I don't want to stop reading. I hate reading those books that I have to push myself to finish. Zane is my favorite! <br />	2005-01-05

I will say that the book was a good effort, but not off the hook. The negative side is, as many others said, the characters were not developed so you could not follow them and become emotionally involved in the book. There were to many characters just thrown on the scene, so I found myself having to re-read sentences trying to follow the story. Qua and Gena's relationship was the most developed relationship which I was semi-involved in, but their relationship wasn't developed either. He took her out of town, they had a nice time, he took her shopping, and boom.... there is the foundation of their relationship. Now she is so in love she can't see straight and he is her soulmate.There was no background as to where their love came from or them growing together through any situations. It was just that he bought her plenty of things. There were plenty of times I just wanted to stop reading the book, but I had to know what the hype was all about. The book was exagerated to me. I know some drug dealers make it to be millionaires, but not many. She should have been more realistic, or rather identified with more of the drug dealers that were ballers, but not have millions at their disposal. What millionaire do you know that takes his coke to some lil' lady that can't even pay her rent? And supposively he was moving plenty of kilos! Millionaires are to smart for stuff like that. They are not on front street with just any ole person. Teri had alot of unnecessary murder. It was just not a good plot and no plot for that matter. Now that I think about it, I should have given her 2 stars. The 3 stars is for effort. I didn't hate the book. Its just that it was unrealistic, had no plot or moral to the story, it was just a bunch of killing and slanging dope. The end was STUPID! I can't believe that she did that to Qua! He was the best thing about the story. It should have ended different. If you want to read a real street story...PLEASE READ THE COLDEST WINTER EVER OR B-MORE CAREFUL!!!!! Now those books gets 10 stars. <br />	2005-01-05

This is the first book I read of Sistah Souljah's and I agree that she should be given as much credit as other famous authors. When people ask me of a good book, I always say The Coldest Winter Ever. I thought people were exagerating when they said the book was all that. This book takes you into the life of a drug dealer's daughter who only knew the streets and how to hustle and she goes through MANY obstacles in this book. It shows the effects of being a drug dealers child, the glamorous side and the not so glamarous side. The book was so real!! It was a real page turner!! Winter was a product of her environnment. She lived a fabulous life, had the best of everything, was respected in her hood and then bam.... everything changes. This story is how Winter tries to make lemonade with lemons. The plot is unbelievable! I read this book in a little over 2 days. Please read this book. Sistah Souljah did an excellent job!!!! <br />	2005-01-05

It kept my attention the entire book and was filled with hot sex scenes, as well as plenty of humor. Sisters of AFP is basically about a country girl who is sexually inexperienced. Mary Ann moves to D.C. and finds out she has a sexual side she didn't know about. She learns that sex is not just to please a man. Mary Ann goes on an adventure of trying to find sexual freedom. Zane did a good job. I am always impressed with her creativity and choice of words. I will recommend this book to others. <br />	2005-01-05

Maybe because I cursed a little because this garbage had me hot. I have never read such a classless book like this. No mother in their right mind would hurt their only daughter that way. I couldn't get into this book no matter how hard I tried. Don't patronize this crap. This book is not worth the paper it was wrote on. <br />	2005-01-05

Now, not to glorify violence, but if you are looking to read a good street novel, Dutch should do it. The book starts off with Dutch in a court room, and the book explains how and why he became so feared and how he came up in the game. Dutch does some ruthless cold hearted crap in this book. It's wrong, but it'll make you say damn that's gangsta! It's a very good read, if you like drug filled, mobb type stories. <br />	2005-01-05

Reading Invisible Life really helped alot when reading this book because it provides some back ground. I felt like I knew the characters in this book. Kyle is my favorite in this book. He is so funny and spunky. Kyle's story will touch your heart. This book grabbed me more emotionally than Invisible Life. Nicole's experience with love is beautiful. Ray is still battling with himself. Just As I Am is a book of friendship, love, and self acceptance. Read it.	2005-01-05

Baisden created every main character in the book with a different issue. I would say it is the men's version of Waiting to Exhale. One had baby momma drama, one liked only young girls, one had not commited to one woman.... <br />After reading the book I found myself wanting to know more about them. I didn't want the book to end. Reading the book was more like looking at a movie instead of reading a book. Read it, you won't be disappointed. <br />	2005-01-05

I have never heard of this author before I read this book, so now I have every one of her books and am planning on reading them back to back. Everybody knows that Jalin is a true player. But not just the average oh I am lieing to keep all these women type of player, he is a player that tells you like it is and you can accept it or don't let the door hit you where the good Lord split you. This book is so funny, but oh so real. It is amazing to me how women are so desperate these days that they sleep behind each other and sleep with everybody's man. But anyway, in a nutshell Jalin is a man who feels no one woman can fulfill all his many needs. But he learns some lessons about love and the heart through drama and more drama. This book is just good, that's all I can say. Ms. Hampton also has some steamy sex scenes. You definitely won't be disappointed with this book. The reviews are lot lieing to you. Go get the book ASAP. <br />	2005-01-05

I guess I favor books that leave you on the edge of your seat and are sexual, funny, drama filled, etc. This is more of an emotional read about Tandi's problems in her marriage, with her father, her brother. The book was long and drawn out. Some would call it descriptive, I call it boring. I enjoyed parts of the book. But for the most part, it's not my cup of tea. I absolutely loved The Honeywell. That was some edge of your seat writing.	2004-12-21

She painted pictures of the hood very well. Nikki was just on point. From the people hanging outside on the porch, running the cars thinking that you want some drugs, gals hating and being sheisty, women lowering their standards and accepting certain things to maintain a lifestyle of the rich and the lazy, females in the beauty shop being nosey....the list goes on and on. Nikki definitely told a entertaining but powerful story. Tressa was determined not to settle for Lucky and his crazy ways. Tressa understood that all the money in the world won't buy peace of mind and happiness.  A Project Chick takes you into Tressa's shoes of struggling to make it after she wants out of her relationship with Lucky. Tressa goes through the baby daddy drama, dealing with living in the projects but wanting more, having to suck in her pride and do what she has to do, going through different men, and more. This is a story of perserverance. It exceeded my expectations, being some of the reviews aren't great. I think this is a 4.5 star book. Good job Nikki!!	2004-12-10

As We Lay was told from the mistress' point of view, which did give you a insight as to what the other woman is thinking. I am engaged to a man I have been with for ten years and personally I don't like women that mess with other people's men. I sometimes wonder how women can be satisified with being second best, agreeing to be seen when he can get away, and sleep alone every night. But Brett's attitude did shed some light on how some women think. There was way to much unneccessary dialogue in this book. Brett and Eric don't even meet face to face until 100 pages into the book!! The author spent alot of time describing the atmosphere and other things than making the actual storyline exciting. I felt like the story could have had much more drama being the situation was Eric sleeping with two women. But that must not be her writing style. Brenda Hampton, Zane, or Carl Weber would have ate that storyline alive!! Darlene Johnson didn't include Eric and Gaby's relationship enough. I wanted to go inside of their world, not just Eric and Brett's. I also agree with the other reviewers about the ending. It made me so mad. The tragic incident was so abrupt and seemed to come out of nowhere. Like I said, I have a negative and positive opinion about this book. Well, I guess I didn't say much positive. I did enjoy looking from the other woman's view. But once a man has vowed to God to be with someone else till death do you part, he is off limits! And Brett and Eric never would have discovered whatever it was that they felt about each other had they never pursued it. You can't miss what you never had.	2004-12-02

Most of the time I will finish a book if I start it because it normally gets better through the book. Well, I couldn't force myself to because I am not interested. And the worst part is that the book is written in such a confusing way, that it is hard to follow the story and I feel like I barely know what the story is about. By the time you get to page 40 or so, you should at least be interested. Maybe I will try again, after I read these other books that are waiting on me, but as for now.....it is a waste of my time. I sort of have Brenda Hampton to thank for not being able to read just any ole thing. Her books are the bomb, and I am reading other stuff waiting on her to come out with some more books. Personally, Denise's writing style doesn't cut it for me.	2004-11-22
