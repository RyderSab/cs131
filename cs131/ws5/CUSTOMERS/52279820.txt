The title is certainly impressive, one book to review all the IT topics required for the CCP exam. <br /> <br />But it is just another text book and very difficult to read and absorb.  it should be fairly obvious that people reading a book of this nature are knowledgeable and experienced in IT and just need a book to co-ordinate and summarise all the topics and ideas in order to pass the CCP exam.  To me, it should be written concisely with various topics and diagrams and in point form so as to facilitate revision .  This book is quite difficult to read and time-consuming to get through.  There is a book 'Introduction to Business Information Systems' by J.K Pierson, a Harcourt Brace and Jovanovich College Outline Series which seems to serve the purpose.  Unfortunately, it was written in 1988, is considerably outdated and a new revised edition never came out <br /> <br />There are a  few excellent British books which are not intended for CCP exams but which cover the topics adequately and present them in a easy-to-read format.

A person reading and mastering this book no longer has to spend the money to be taught by a TM teacher.  Moreover, it clears up all the mysteries surrounding TM.  TM is a good and effective way to invoke the power and wisdom of the subconscious mind and not infallible magic. <br /> <br />The most significant part of this book is the part dealing with the rules of eliciting Relaxation Response.  The rest deals with basic medical and phisiological knowledge concerning stress and its related problems together with the test results the author used to justify the techniques he advocated.   <br /> <br />I agree with him 100% but I am not sure if these theories and results can convince readers from all walks of life.   <br /> <br />To me, poring over Charles Haanel's 'Master Key' and practicing the techniques in this book will be absolutely great and convincing.	2004-12-18

I have resisted going to class because it is quite expensive and because I do not believe, as the expert on TM Robert Roth claimed , -that TM could not be learnt from a book or tape.  This is an ideal book. I am quite convinced that TM is just a way to invoke the power and wisdom of the subconscious mind.  There are other techniques - affirmative prayer, auto-suggestion, Silva Mind Control and self-hypnosis and they are just as effective and useful.  TM is good but it should be not considered infallible magic.	2004-10-17

Should be read by anyone who wants to know more about Transcendental Meditation.<br />I must, however, make a very severe comment.  The author portrays TM as a kind of infallible magic.  I have no doubt about his sincerity.  Bit I cannot accept the argument  that TM must be learnt from a face-to-face interview with a teacher and cannot be learnt by reading a book or listening to a tape.  TM is not that much different from auto-suggestion, self-hypnosis or the Silva Mind Control or even prayer.  It costs about $1600 (in Canada, as of Oct 2004) to be enrolled in a TM course with a teacher.  Are you trying to raise money for the TM organisation Mr. Roth ?	2004-10-12

A very good and in-depth look at one of the most contraversial men in Modern Chinese history.<BR>Chiang was a typical Chinese of the past generation.<BR>He was vicious, authoritarian, inflexible and narrow-minded.  He had  brought a lot of miseries and sufferings to China and the Chinese people.  But I am inclined to believe that the Chinese people were partly to blame. Up until recently the ideas of democracy and equality never entered the China mind depite appreciation of Western ideas and philosophy.  I understand that F.D. Roosevelt considered getting rid of him but the Chinese people could not have a leader replaced unless death or convulsive revolution took place.<br />I do give him credit for letting his son run the country in his later years without interfering. The younger Chiang worked hard in economic development and made Taiwan one of the tigers of South East Asia.<br />I would urge politicians of both China and Taiwan to read this book carefully so as to make China a true modern and democratic state.	2004-05-07

One thing bothers me,  MR Barber stated that Chiang Kai Shek married Sun Yat Sen's daughter to help him gain the job as China's leader.  In fact, Chiang's wife was Sun Yat Sen's sister-in-law and it was generally believed that Chiang, who was poorly educated and knew little or no English,  wanted the marriage in order to have good connections and dealings with powerful wealthy Americans - things Madame Soong May Ling and her family possessed.

But I find some flaws with this book. First, the only thing that went wrong with this war was none other than his inability to look at its human aspects and his infatuation with statistics. He said in 1962/63 that the war could be won in three years but he did not say about this in the book. His stupid assertion that Jack Kennedy would have done a better job had he lived longer shows that McNamara was not only a stupid but a thankless man.  Lyndon Johnson gave him enormous power (more than any other Defense Secretary had) and even considered him as a possible running-mate.  Lastly, he did not have the gust to resign and to speak out against the war when he was convinced that it was a wrong war and could not be won. <BR>I do not know how much royalties he got from this book but they should all go to the families whose loved ones died needlessly in Vietnam.<BR> Is he really a whiz-kind ?	2002-07-14

To me, the job of the historian is to look at historical events retrospectively and come up with viable analyses. This has been the case for Macaulay, Prescott, Trevelyan, Churchill and Barbara Tuchman, great historians of our times. We human beings are not gifted with crystal balls to foretell the future. Paul Kennedy tried to use past events to predict the future (to look prospectively). As things unfolded since the publication of this book, a lot of his predictions were false amd looked silly. More are likely to come. It is time for Mr Kennedy to realise that what he tried to do is an impossible task.

Since then a lot of other books have come into being, books by  Ernest Holmes, Joseph Murphy and U.S. Andersen which explained why there is magic in believing.  For the layman, this is very good indeed.<br />Mr Bristol, however, still has not completely shaken himself off from traditional beliefs.  He advised readers not to  us this power  for evil purposes.  This is a dubious thing.  How do you define 'evil purposes' ?  If, in using this power of believing, a person gets what he wants and triumphs over other people, it can be construed that he uses it for an evil purpose.  <br />The other thing that he mentioned is  'don't try to use it for betting and gambling'.  If the power is available and a person uses it in gambling and betting with complete faith and singleness of purpose and succeeds, what is really wrong ?  This brings him back to the traditional belief that hard work must be involved in any undertaking.	2001-05-23

I am afraid he has not done his job as an historian, who should be fair, impartial and truthful.  He was a member of the Kennedy gang. Everything he wrote pointed to two things.  Kennedy and his men were great and infallible.  All other  politicians, not memebers of the Kennedy gang were bad, and mediocre.  Let  us get the facts.  Eisenhower and his administration had the best foreign  policy in post WWII history yet Eisenhower was portrayed by the author as  useless and highly incompentent.  According to Mr McNamara's book (Vietnam,  a Retrospect) the Kennedy administration first fouled up on Vietnam and  eventually led to the most disastrous war in U.S. history.  Yet the author  portrayed the Kennedy gang as superb and brilliant.  According to Mr  Hersh's book (The Dark Side of Camelot), both Jack and Bobby were  unscrupulous and immoral,not the holy men portrayed by the author. Perhaps  the author was not aware of some of these facts in 1965 when he wrote the  book.  It is time for him, as a professional historian, to make some kind  of confession	2000-04-19

But the reader must bear in mind that the Chinese people (even today) are experts in putting up a good face  to impress people from the West. There was definitely some bias on the part  of the author to paint Mao and his comrades as great and infallible.  So a  sensible reader should read this book with these in mind , observe what has  happened in China  since 1949 and reach his/her conclusions.	2000-04-02

The ideas are certainly not new.  But the way these ideas are presented is superb and unmatched. Too bad there is only one other book by V. Bloodworth &quot;Golden Keys to a Lifetime of Living' and  it is out of print.  Devorss should consider reproducing this book.	2000-03-26

To me, an SQL Plus book should deal  with using the most basic and useful commands, for example, various powerful functions, date handling, etc.  This books  covers some PL./SQL , Oracle load , tuning and administration -- strictly  speaking not part of SQL  Plus.  With the widespread use of Developer 2000,  the Report Writing part of SQL Plus is losing its importance and there  should not be given too much coverage.  For one trying to take the Oracle  Certification in SQL Plus, this is not a suitable book	2000-01-07

While I am very disgusted with the Kennedys, I do believe retribution has been given to both Jack and Bobby with their early and tragic deaths.  What I find very disturbing were the people who worked with or were associated with the Kennedys, they never spoke out .  Money and power have certainly corrupted  a lot of people	1998-06-09
