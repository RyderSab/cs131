Sticking to incrementalism will lead to a long and painful death for businesses. The only hope is innovation, especially in an age where you are not only competing with local players, but are engaged in open competition from those all around the world - some of which inherently possess lower cost structures. Innovation is the next frontier. Through innovation you'll be able to set your sights higher and create surprising experiences for your customers. <br /> <br />Making Innovation Work is a great book on applying structure to the innovation process. While pure innovation cannot always be systematized, applied structure is necessary to move ideas from the wonderful world of thought to the real world of application. In essence it's all about applied innovation. The authors explain seven innovation rules which talk about innovations power to redefine industry. The rules explain the need for strong leadership, reasons for weaving innovation into corporate thought, managing creativity, as well as creating the right metrics and rewards to spur innovation. <br /> <br />All in all, Making Innovation Work is an excellent book which will show you how to stimulate and most importantly, apply innovation to create real world, bottom-line results. Entrepreneurs and managers alike  need to understand that innovation is not about repackaging the old, it's about creating the new. My personal recommendation is to read Making Innovation Work as well as Clayton Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma. Go ahead - shoot for the moon! <br /> <br />------------------ <br />Michael Davis <br />Founder -- Epoch Strategic Ventures (Innovation Network) <br />Editor, Byvation (Newsletter)	2005-09-30

Action without vision is a nightmare.\\" - Japanese Proverb <br /> <br />The keys to building a successful business are Vision, Strategy, and Action. Without effective execution, no business strategy can hope to succeed. For existing business, many political and organizational obstacles stand in the way of translating strategy into action. For startups, the major obstacle is resources. Resources must be acquired and alliances need to be formed. <br /> <br />Hrebiniak speaks from personal experience and exhaustive research. Making Strategy Work gives you the tools for making strategy work. Although obviously written for senior-level management, all managers (and even professionals) would do well to learn how to transform strategy into results. <br /> <br />Entrepreneurs need to read this book. While I often focus on the strategy side of the house, it's execution that transforms blueprints into skyscrapers. Making Strategy Work needs to be sitting on your desk - right next to those on strategy and innovation. Now go out there and make something great happen. <br />________________________________________ <br /> <br />\\"One can NEVER consent to CREEP when one feels an impulse to SOAR.\\" - Helen Keller <br /> <br />Michael Davis <br />Founder - Epoch Strategic Ventures (A Strategic Network) <br />Editor - Byvation	2005-08-30

When you're in business, you need to remember just that - it's business. Many startups seem disillusioned when competition comes out of the woodwork, determined to destroy their company. It's not a personal attack, it's business. The focus of Hardball is on winners in business who've always played hardball. Winners \\"use every legitimate resource and strategy available to them to gain advantage over their competitors...\\" The reality is that business is about winning, not playing nice.    Hardballers are in the game to win - again and again. It makes me think of Lance Armstrong's recent quest for and winning of seven straight Tour de France races. Lance absolutely dominated the competition, as any athlete should. As long as you play by the rules, which in the case of business means to engage in open and free competition without deception [...], companies should strive to dominate their field. Open competition forces all players to strive harder and to be the very best, which in turn benefits the customer.    As a startup, you'll do well to focus on the realities of competition. Don't ever fall in to the trap of thinking that there is no competition for what you're offering. Even if no close products are on the market, they're out there somewhere. Step on the wrong toes and you'll soon find out how wrong you are. Read hardball and learn what it really takes to become a champion!  ________________________________________    \\"One can NEVER consent to CREEP when one feels an impulse to SOAR.\\" - Helen Keller    Michael Davis  Founder - Epoch Strategic Ventures (A Strategic Network)  Editor - Byvation	2005-08-30

The world really has changed. Earth as we know it changed - almost overnight. Computerization infused communications empowered globalization. According to Friedman, globalization may be divided into 3 phases:    1.0, up to 1800, States  2.0, 1800-2000, Multinational Corporations  3.0, 2000 +, Brilliant Individuals.    With 13 chapters, The World is Flat is a somewhat long, yet very worthwhile, read.    Friedman lists 10 Great Levelers that give rise to a flat world, of which two are well on their way to undermining the status quo at this very moment:    Open-sourcing - Self-organizing communities    Wireless - Creating a highly mobile and personal world    All in all, thought-provoking! The World is Flat clearly shows that our world is not the same one we lived in just a few decades ago. It's new and in such, brings many new opportunities.

As a former IT Manager at Metlife, and Allstate Insurance, I attest to the fact that the IT department focuses myopically on solving (and sometimes even creating more) computer problems. Therefore, as Carr illustrates, technology offers no competitive advantage - only the prospect of avoiding competitive disadvantage.    Without differentiation, organizations will do well to cut off IT from the rest of the organization and outsource it as a commodity. Carr's premise is that IT is undergoing commoditization and may cease to provide a sustainable competitive advantage. Hardware is already a commodity. Software is quickly becoming commodity like. What Carr illustrates is a clear and compelling reason to step up our efforts to use technology strategically to support the core business. After all, technology exists to serve the business, not the other way around.    (...)	2005-08-01

What a wakeup call! Too bad I didn't read this book sooner - before I learned some of the lessons the hard way. All entrepreneurs and those aspiring to be entrepreneurs \\"need\\" this book. <br /> <br />If you're starting up a company, then read this book. If you've already started a company, stop and read this as soon as possible - before you screw things up even worse. <br /> <br />Adams runs AV Labs, with plenty of time in the trenches. So listen up. The 1990's really messed with entrepreneurs heads. Instead of identifying a solid market need and building products that meet those needs, entrepreneurs were told - by Venture Capitalists, and the Media, to take on the world. Business models were thrown out the window. Forget profits, or even revenues, just catch as many \\"eyeballs\\" as possible and you'll be the next Microsoft. Well, we all know what happened ... Crash! <br /> <br />Assembled into ten kicks, the book is overflowing with true wisdom: <br /> <br />   1. Good Ideas Are a Dime a Dozen <br />   2. You Don't Know Your Customer As Well As You Think You Do <br />   3. Don't Wait to Ship a Killer Product---Get to Market Fast <br />   4.

Big Companies Need to Act More Like Startups <br /> <br />Final Kick: This One's Yours to Give in the Marketplace!   <br /> <br />We probably all need a good, hard kick - I know I did.

While not the richest man in the world, Trump is one of the most resilient. On the Forbes 400, his wealth is estimated at $2.6 Billion. Therefore, I'm all ears when it comes to advice straight from the horse's mouth. <br /> <br />Trumps book on How to Get Rich is chock full of advice, especially for getting off the ground - and that's what individuals and start-ups alike need more than anything else. <br /> <br />\\"Get going ... Don't just sit on the runway and hope someone will come along and push the airplane.\\" - Donald Trump <br /> <br />Trump also says that \\"Negativity is also a form of fear, and fear can be paralyzing.\\" So true!

Listening to Bijoy Goswami at a DallasBlue networking event in February opened up a new line of thinking for me. Rather than try to be something I'm not, I instead recognized my desperate internal struggle to return to my core. <br /> <br />During his presentation and throughout his book, Bijoy hones in on the three types of people that comprise this wonderful world of ours. Mavens are driven by knowledge, Relaters are driven by relationships, and evangelists are driven by action. Each of us possesses a \\"core.\\" And, when we step too far outside that core we develop internal struggles. Instead of fighting it, we should use our \\"core\\" power to propel us to new heights. <br /> <br />A quick read, the Human Fabric is made up of 7 chapters. <br /> <br />Chapter 1 - Revisiting the Golden Rule <br /> <br />Chapter 2 - Mavens <br />Chapter 3 - Relaters <br />Chapter 4 - Evangelists <br />Chapter 5 - Synthesis <br /> <br />Chapter 6 - MRE for Corporations <br />Chapter 7 - Broader Applications <br /> <br />I wholeheartedly recommend that you read this book. It's much easier to become successful in life if you understand what makes up your \\"core\\". <br /> <br />As an example, Bijoy mentions in his book that the perfect startup company would comprise a Maven (with the technical expertise), a Relater (with a golden rolodex of contacts), and an Evangelist to persuade others to join the cause. <br /> <br />------------------ <br />Michael Davis, Editor - Byvation	2005-05-31

Books	5	2	6	N	N	Just the opposite of what MFPT taught you!	Recently in a Toastmaster meeting a speaker told us how we hardly ever challenge what our \\"Mother, Father, Preacher, Teacher\\" (MFPT) taught us. Fact is, times change. We must change with it ... Or, suffer the consequences. <br /> <br />A couple of years ago I received and read a booklet summary of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. To say the least it was a compelling read. In fact, I still display the booklet on my bookshelf for quick inspiration. <br /> <br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad, is a book that teaches six main lessons: <br /> <br />1) The rich don't work for money <br />2) Why teach financial literacy <br />3) Mind your own business <br />4) The history of taxes and the power of corporations <br />5) The rich invent money <br />6) Work to learn - don't work for money <br /> <br />Throughout the lessons, Kiyosaki helps us understand that to achieve financial success we must do something we are never taught in school and that is \\"to think.\\"  <br /> <br />For the budding Entrepreneur, chapters four (Mind your own business) and five (History of taxes and the power of corporations) hold special interest. The first, because \\"there is a big difference between your profession and your business\\" and the second, because taxes are the single largest expense for most of us - at least until we become wise. <br /> <br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad is, at least to me, more than a book about financial literacy, it is about changing your perspective of the world. In the movie Matrix, Morpheus says (in order to \\"become the one\\") to Neo \\"Free your mind\\".

Some of the examples the authors use are simply timeless in their wisdom. In \\"What Would Croesus Do?\\" you start with a solution (and there always is a solution) and work to create an affordable version. <br /> <br />Other tools include asking pivotal questions such as: <br /> <br />* \\"Why don't you feel my pain?\\" This question stimulates your thinking on exactly how your decisions affect the value chain of which your product is only one part., then to look for better solutions for all  concerned. <br /> <br />* Another key question is \\"Where else would it work?\\" In many cases, the solution to one problem may be readily applied to other problems. <br /> <br />* Finally, you might ask \\"Would flipping it work?\\" Point of View is a powerful tool. Sometimes just flipping things around offers a powerful new solution. <br /> <br />Be sure to check out the author's website for additional information on Why Not?

Instead, the book is about moving from mere e-commerce to e-business, that is, integrating various internet technologies into the heart of your enterprise.  <br /> <br />Net Ready may be summed up by the statement \\"Get 'Net Ready' or get left in the dust.\\" Although the dotcom bust made us sit up and take notice, it also gave us a chance to reflect.

I was captivated by Anthony Robbins	\\"Unlimited Power\\" is an exceptional compliment to \\"Awaken The Giant Within\\" and is easily one of the most powerful books I've ever read. In December 1994, after winning a battle with cancer, I stood, nearly bald, in the audience of my first motivational seminar, conducted by Anthony Robbins. <br /> <br />Shortly after the seminar I read \\"Awaken The Giant Within\\" and \\"Unlimited Power\\" to learn more about taking charge of my destiny. To this day, I refer to these books often for inspiration and guidance. <br /> <br />Over the years, I've read and listened to a great deal of self-help material in my quest to discover the secret to success. Without question, this book provides the clearest and most incredibly inspiring ideas. Since reading this book, I've greatly increased my level of health (by becoming vegetarian), doubled my income, and formed my own consulting company. <br /> <br />\\"Unlimited Power\\" consists of three sections: <br /> <br />Section I: The Modeling of Human Excellence <br /> <br />Section II: The Ultimate Success Formula <br /> <br />Section III: Leadership: The Challenge of Excellence <br /> <br />Although the book is quite long, it is a very exciting read. Starting off with \\"The Commodity of Kings\\" Robbins talks about how specialized knowledge (information) is available to anyone and can literally transform ourselves, and the world. Think of what Bill Gates, through Microsoft, really owns - almost nothing. Instead, he controls a vast reservoir of knowledge. <br /> <br />In summary, what I enjoy most about \\"Unlimited Power\\" and all of Anthony Robbins' other works, is that he challenges you to test his ideas for yourself, instead of accepting ideas on blind faith. Also, I must emphasize that \\"Unlimited Power\\" (or any other book for that matter) WILL NOT magically make you successful. It requires YOU to work with the material, develop strategies, and most importantly - take action.  <br /> <br />----------------- <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-05-05

Chapter 6 on Digital Strategy is also compelling in its own right.

Christensen says outstanding companies can do everything right and still lose their market leadership, or worse, disappear completely. And he not only proves what he says; he tells others how to avoid a similar fate. <br /> <br />To be a successful entrepreneur you must be able to capitalize on change. \\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" is all about dealing with change, from the incumbent's point of view. How valuable do you think it would be to understand how your larger competitors think? That's exactly what this book talks about. <br /> <br />Most large, established firms are inherently weak in one area - they cling to the status quo with a vengeance. While talk of innovation is commonplace, it is the attacker (entrepreneurs) who holds a definitive advantage. Without legacy systems and overbearing bureaucracy it is the entrepreneur who has the upper hand. <br /> <br />\\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" consists of two major parts: <br /> <br />Part One: Why Great Companies Fail <br />Part Two: Managing Disruptive Change <br /> <br />This is one of the most insightful books on business that I have ever read. It explains a very important concept - how radically new (disruptive) technologies can overtake existing well-established (sustaining) technologies and in the process beat market leaders at their own game. <br /> <br />Large companies typically ignore small markets and instead look for growth in established markets. All too often executives of large companies are reluctant to take on challenges in small and unknown terrain since they are always trained to \\"think big\\" - which is good news for Aspiring Entrepreneurs. <br /> <br />Take heed, read this book and learn how to fully exploit disruptive technologies and become the next \\"great company.\\" <br /> <br />----------------- <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-05-05

As a person with limited patience for dry, academic material, I greatly appreciate Mr. Silbiger's ability to concisely deliver the fundamental elements of each topic, while dispensing with the fluff.     The Ten-Day MBA consists of (you guessed it) ten chapters as follows:     1) Marketing  2) Ethics  3) Accounting  4) Organizational Behavior  5) Qualitative Analysis  6) Finance  7) Operations  8) Economics  9) Strategy  10) MBA Mini-Courses on Research, Public Speaking, Negotiating, and International Business.    For Aspiring Entrepreneurs, the Ten-Day MBA should provide you with more than enough knowledge to compete effectively. Used as a reference tool, this book will help you combine your passion and real-world experience to transform ideas into reality.

Putting people first is more often said than done. From extensive research and over ten years of firsthand experience I can honestly say that this is rarely put into practice, particularly in larger organizations. <br /> <br />The very title conveys a powerful message \\"... Building Profits by Putting People First.\\" Since the dawn of the Industrial Age, people were considered costs and therefore something to be minimized or eliminated as much as possible.  <br /> <br />However, this attitude is of little relevance in the Information Age of today. While larger organizations struggle to adapt to actually valuing people for what they are - highly valued assets, a golden opportunity exists for Entrepreneurs who, in forming the companies of tomorrow, seek to maximize profits by putting people first. <br /> <br />Based on his research, Pfeffer offers several HR practices that are common in effective organizations. His book is divided into two main sections: <br /> <br />Part I - People-Centered Management And Organizational Success <br />Part II - Barriers to Implementing Performance Knowledge: How Conventional Wisdom Is Wrong <br /> <br /> <br />For a quick assessment of the power of this book, I recommend you read chapter 10 first - \\"People, Profits, and Perspective\\" and be sure to review figure 10-1 \\"WHAT A PEOPLE-BASED STRATEGY DOES\\" on page 301. <br /> <br />----------------- <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-05-05

Several years ago I attended one of Robert Cooper's seminars and for the next six, very emotional, hours Dr. Cooper inspired me to wake the sleeping giant within. The Other 90%, was immediately placed on my must read list. Cooper's title and premise is based on his grandfather's adage that asserts \\"we use only about 10% of our potential in the course of a lifetime.\\" <br /> <br />Dr. Cooper shares numerous inspiring stories, and practical new tools for taking your life to the next level. Cooper's theorem in reaching the other 90% is built around Four Keystones: <br /> <br />1) Trust <br />2) Energy <br />3) Farsightedness <br />4) Nerve <br /> <br /> - Trust is centered on building and maintaining exceptional relationships. This keystone provides one with a support system designed to maintain high levels of thought, energy and emotional stability, all essential foundational attributes.  <br /> <br />- The energy keystone is pointed toward \\"increasing your calm effectiveness under pressure.\\" Practical exercises and pauses ensure that our minds, hearts, and guts are working in concert.  <br /> <br />- Farsightedness is the keystone I believe to be of utmost importance to business leaders everywhere. Einstein asserted, \\"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\\" Well, if this is true, then farsightedness, or having the ability (imagination) to dream of great things, is what we should all strive for.  <br /> <br />- The fourth and final keystone: nerve. Let's face it, this emotional attribute holds many great individuals at bay. Nerve or the ability to muster courage at a moment's notice is one of the great barriers to greatness. Do you have dreams, ambitions, desires that you've failed to act upon? Why?  <br /> <br />In closing, once you've finished reading THE OTHER 90%, you will have a better idea of the tools needed to tap into your untapped potential. If nothing else, read the section on Farsightedness; it is well worth the price of the book. <br /> <br />------- <br /> <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-05-02

Is a fun book, sort of like \\"Who moved my cheese\\" (1) <br /> <br />My experience in several Fortune 500 companies, both as an employee and as a consultant testifies to the fact that Fish! is more fact than fiction. <br /> <br />One fundamental difference is the book's realism. The book draws lessons from an unlikely source of inspiration, the fun-loving fishmongers at Seattle's Pike Place Market. <br /> <br />In Fish! the heroine, Mary Jane Ramirez, having left sunny California to move to Seattle, and then suddenly widowed, is asked to engineer a turnaround of her company's troubled operations department, a group that the authors describe as a \\"toxic energy dump.\\" Most reasonable heads would call it a day and move on. Why bother with this bunch of losers? Of course the authors don't make it so easy for Mary Jane. Instead, she's left to sort out this mess with the help of head fishmonger Lonnie. Fish! aims to help employees find their way to a fun and happy workplace.  <br /> <br />While some may find the story line and prescriptions -- such as \\"Choose Your Attitude,\\" \\"Make Their Day,\\" and \\"Be Present\\" -- downright corny, others will find a good dose of worthwhile motivational management techniques. If you loved Who Moved My Cheese? then you'll find much to like here. <br /> <br />Shouldn't work be more than grudgingly toiling for 8, 9, 10 + hours a day? And, why shouldn't it be fun. It reminds me of a statement I once read (2) about money myths - \\"it's not right to enjoy yourself and get paid for it.\\" Who made up this garbage? While reading Fish! is not a magic solution to productivity, it is a step in the right direction. My personal recommendation is for senior managers to read this book first, then ask associates to read with the understanding that senior managers will be open to discuss how to build a better, more productive, and fun workplace. <br /> <br /> <br />1) \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\", Spencer Johnson.

It tells a story of a rabbit that is going to school to become well-rounded, sound familiar? Moving along, the rabbit excels in hopping and running classes. However, the rabbit didn't do so well in swimming class. Flying class was even worse; he couldn't even get off the ground. He felt like a failure. Naturally, his parents reinforced the school's intent to create well-rounded students. And, the school counselor \\"helped\\" the rabbit by canceling his running and hopping classes and putting him in extra swimming and flying classes. Don't worry, there is a happy ending, courtesy of the Wise Old Owl. <br /> <br />Authors Clifton and Nelson offer an interesting book on how we, in business and in life, fail to focus on our strengths and manage our weaknesses. Consider how often the top salesperson is promoted into management, irrespective of actual leadership ability.  <br /> <br />The authors advocate \\"The Power Of One Simple Question\\" which is \\"What would happen if we studied what was right with people versus what's wrong with people?\\"  <br /> <br />Applying the principles to my own life, I soon discovered that I too fell deeply into the trap of focusing on my non-strengths (weaknesses) instead of my strengths. In fact, there are some things I'm just better off not doing or at least delegating to others. <br /> <br />In summary, many insights are offered throughout this book. Business owners and managers will do well to read this book and apply the principles, first to their own lives, then to encourage associates to discover and focus on their own strengths. Focusing on strengths is one of the few remaining hidden secrets of unleashing productivity. <br /> <br />----- <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-05-02

It's a matter of life and death (at least for your company). <br /> <br />\\"Vision without action is a daydream. Action without vision is a nightmare.\\" - Japanese proverb <br /> <br />Why read a book on strategy? Quite simply, to be successful. Technology and globalization culminated in ferocious competition for virtually all industries. To be competitive in today's world, you must understand that all value is derived from the customer. Therefore, you will do well to delve deep into how to create value for the customer. <br /> <br />Competition is becoming increasingly global. Therefore, it is in your best interest to understand how national, international, and governmental issues affect your industry and hence, your company. <br /> <br />Third in Porter's landmark trilogy, Competitive Advantage of Nations, somewhat different from his first two books, focuses less on industries and companies themselves, and more on how a firm actually gains an advantage over its rivals.  <br />  <br />Competitive Advantage of Nations consists of four parts: <br /> <br />Part I - Foundations, presents the theoretical frameworks which form the basis for the rest of the book. In Chapters 2, 3 and 4 Porter revisits most of his previous work, such as the five competitive forces, generic strategies, the value chain, and the advantages \\"diamond\\".  <br /> <br />Part II - Industries, frameworks of Part I are applied to explain the histories of four industries (German printing press, American patient monitoring equipment, Italian ceramic tiles, and Japanese robotics). In addition, Porter applies the frameworks to the service sector.  <br /> <br />Part III - Nations, frameworks of Part I are applied to ten nations. Porter splits these ten nations up in early post-war winners, emerging nations in the 1970s and 1980s, and the traditional business countries (Britain and USA).  <br /> <br />Part IV - Implications, Porter discusses the impact of the frameworks of Part I on company's strategies and government policies. In the final chapter Porter tries to answer the question, \\"What of the future?\\" According to Porter \\"the central economic concern of every nation should be the capacity of its economy to upgrade so that firms achieve more sophisticated competitive advantages and higher productivity. Only in this way can there be a rising standard of living and economic prosperity.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />In summary, Competitive Advantage is a must read for any Aspiring Entrepreneur. To lead your company into the future you must create and capture value. Reading this book will help you better understand how firms within industries gain a competitive advantage. Don't be blindsided by the comfort of the moment, prepare for the future now. <br /> <br />------------- <br /> <br />Michael Davis, President - Brencom Strategic Business Consulting	2005-05-02

First, he explains how there are three distinct personalities involved in running a business. Secondly, and my favorite part, he clarifies the distinction between working ON your business instead of working IN your business. Finally, he constructs a working model on how to build a successful business. <br /> <br />Chapter 1 describes \\"The Entrepreneurial Myth.\\" Mr. Gerber emphasizes over and over again, most business owners make the fatal assumption that if they understand the TECHNICAL work of a business, they understand the BUSINESS that does the technical work. Just because you know how to be a carpenter or accountant doesn't mean that you know how to run a carpentry or accounting business. <br /> <br />Chapter 2, \\"The Entrepreneur, the Manager, and the Technician,\\" the three personalities in every person who goes into business. Vision, pragmatism, and action, the contributions of these personalities, are all required for success.  <br /> <br />Chapters 3 to 6 explain different stages in the life of a business. <br /> <br />Chapter 7 dissects and uncovers the new revolution in business today. <br /> <br />Chapter 8 outlines what is called a Franchise Prototype. Not to be confused with retail franchises, it is a method of creating a business autopilot. <br /> <br />Chapter 9 literally explains itself - \\"Working On Your Business, Not In It.\\"  <br /> <br />Chapters 10 to 18 (Part III) show how to develop the systems that will out you in control of your business, instead of the other way around. <br /> <br />After reading The E-Myth Revisited, you will understand the difference between being self-employed and being a full-fledged business owner who leads others and manages systems. <br /> <br />----- <br /> <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-05-02

It's a matter of life and death (at least for your company).    \\"Vision without action is a daydream. Action without vision is a nightmare.\\" - Japanese proverb      Why read a book on strategy? Quite simply, to be successful. Technology and globalization culminated in ferocious competition for virtually all industries. Since industry forces, like ocean tides, loom large over the success on any individual business, it is wise to carefully study business strategy.    Competitive Strategy is part one of Michael Porter's trilogy, providing a foundation for Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance, and The Competitive Advantage of Nations.    Two main themes are Porter's analysis of industries, which captures the complexity of industry competition in five underlying forces and his three generic strategies -- lowest cost, differentiation, and focus. In this book, Porter presents a whole new perspective on how profit is created and divided.    As technology fads and Internet business models come and go, every company must still address the basics of competition as outlined within this book.    The book consists of three parts - General Analytical Techniques, Generic Industry Environments, and Strategic Decisions. In addition, the two appendices - Portfolio Techniques in Competitor Analysis, and How to Conduct an Industry Analysis - should also be mentioned, as they are very useful.     Part I, Porter discusses the structural analysis of industries (with the world-famous five forces), the three generic competitive strategies (overall cost leadership, focus, and differentiation). Also he discusses an excellent framework for competitor analysis, competitive moves, strategy toward buyers and suppliers, structural analysis within industries (strategic groups, strategic mapping, mobility barriers), and industry evolution (life cycle, evolutionary processes).     In Part II, Porter discusses competitive strategy within various generic industry environments, such as fragmented industries (with no real market leader), emerging industries (e-commerce and Internet are excellent examples, although not mentioned in this book as it was written in 1980), mature industries, declining industries, and global industries.    In Part III, Porter discusses strategic decisions which businesses/firms can take, such as vertical integration (forward, backward, partnerships), capacity expansion, and entry into new industries/businesses.    In summary, it is your responsibility, as a business owner or senior manager, to lead your company into the future by identifying and seizing possibilities. Competitive Strategy helps you understand the competitive forces within an industry and the strategic steps a company can take to enhance its competitive position.     ----    Michael Davis, President - Brencom Strategic Business Consulting	2005-05-02

It talked about the power of wisdom and how you must see the world differently. While reading this book I had more 'aha' moments than with any other book in recent memory. If you don't get the book's message at first, read it again because there is a profound message to be learned. I'm already seeing the world in a way I know most people don't.  <br /> <br />Aman Motwane hints that when you have the power of wisdom you possess the magic of seeing what others can't. He claims that successful people don't know different things...they just see things differently. <br /> <br />Motwane breaks down the power of wisdom into seven compartments. They are: <br /> <br />* The wisdom of duality <br />* The wisdom of resonance <br />* The wisdom of ecology <br />* The wisdom of aggregation <br />* The wisdom of magnanimity <br />* The wisdom of stratification <br />* The wisdom of enlightenment <br /> <br />Reflect for a moment on the wisdom of duality. \\"If you want to create a fuller, richer life, relinquish your need to have friends and associates with whom you are always 'comfortable'.\\" says Motwane. Moving on he injects that we should look for opposite people in our life. To be successful you should \\"Cherish devil's advocates.\\" And \\"Nourish mavericks.\\" <br /> <br />To sum up, our joy and self-worth in life is directly related to how we view our circumstances and ourselves. We can either chose to be victims and blame others for our circumstances. Or, we could remove ourselves from the circumstance completely and come from a place of complete personal responsibility. That responsibility includes thinking for ourselves, knowing our personal feelings, and being attuned to the thinking and feelings of others. <br /> <br /> <br />Michael Davis, President - Brencom Strategic Business Consulting	2005-04-27

Change is inescapable. <br /> <br />Regardless of where it occurs, individuals must choose how to respond to change. Change can be a blessing or a curse, depending on your perspective. <br /> <br />The message of Who Moved My Cheese? is that all can come to see it as a blessing, if they understand the nature of cheese and the role it plays in their lives. <br /> <br />Who Moved My Cheese? is a fun book told in a parable about life in a maze. Four beings live in that maze: Sniff and Scurry are mice - nonanalytical and nonjudgmental, they just want cheese and are willing to do whatever it takes to get it. Hem and Haw are \\"littlepeople,\\" mouse-size humans who have an entirely different relationship with cheese. It's not just sustenance to them; it's their self-image. <br /> <br />Overall it is short, concise and very easy to read. Told in story form enables all readers to understand and benefit from the book. Most people can easily relate to some of the situations that were described (I know I can). On more than a few occasions, when the handwriting was on the wall, I acted as Hem did, thinking things would return to normal.  <br /> <br />On one such occasion, about ten years ago, my employer was involved in a merger with another company. Reluctant to change, I procrastinated. Suddenly, jolted to my senses by a 45 days notice, I got my act together and made things happen. Although, in the end I did find a better, and higher paying, job, I engaged in a risk that caused much stress for nearly two months. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book because it is essential for people to understand more about change and how they can deal with it. Change is not necessary a bad thing. It is just a matter of how you approach it. <br /> <br />Michael Davis, Editor - Byvation	2005-04-27

Second, in Porter's landmark trilogy, Competitive Advantage describes how a firm actually gains an advantage over its rivals.

Porter then explains the impact of the value chain on cost advantage, differentiation, technology and competitors. <br /> <br />Part II) Competitive Scope within an Industry <br /> <br />Discusses industry segmentation and substitution. <br /> <br />Part III) Corporate Strategy and Competitive Advantage <br /> <br />Explains the interrelationships among business units and their impact on horizontal strategy, achievement of interrelationships, and complementary products. <br /> <br />Part IV) Implications for Offensive and Defensive Competitive  <br /> <br />Strategy.

To lead your company into the future you must create and capture value. Reading this book will help you better understand the value creation process and how value is what buyers are willing to pay for. Ultimately, the difference between value and the cost of delivering value is profit. <br /> <br /> <br />Michael Davis, President - Brencom Strategic Business Consulting	2005-04-27

Foresight arises from wanting to make a difference in people's lives. <br /> <br />Chapter 5: Crafting Strategic Architecture <br />\\"Not only must the future be imagined ... it must be built.\\" <br />Strategic architecture is a set of plans on how to turn your dream into reality.  <br /> <br />Chapter 6: Strategy as Stretch <br />\\"It is not cash that fuels the journey to the future, but the emotional and intellectual energy of every employee.\\" Strategy must be built upon the juncture of where the firm is and where it wants to be. <br /> <br />Chapter 7: Strategy as Leverage <br />The real issue for many struggling managers is not a lack of resources, but too many priorities, too little stretch, and too little creative thinking about how to leverage resources. <br /> <br />Chapter 8: Competing to Shape the Future <br />Getting to the futurefirst may empower a company to establish the rules by which other companies will have to compete. <br /> <br />Chapter 9: Building Gateways to the Future <br />Every top management team is competing not only to protect the firm's position within existing markets, but to position the firm to succeed in new markets. <br /> <br />Chapter 10: Embedding the Core Competence Perspective <br />All too often, opportunity that falls between the cracks of existing market and departmental definitions, gets overlooked. <br /> <br />Chapter 11: Securing the Future <br />What counts most is not hitting a bulls' eye the first time, but how quickly one can improve one's aim and get another arrow on the way to the target. <br /> <br />Chapter 12: Thinking Differently <br />\\"To ultimately 'be' different, a company must first 'think' differently.\\" To share in the future, a company must learn as much about thinking differently as it does about what to do. <br /> <br /> <br />Competing for the Future is a lively study in how to transform today's dreams into tomorrow's reality. Don't read this book at your own peril. Competing today, without regard to tomorrow's possibilities will certainly stack the odds in your competitor's favor. <br /> <br />Michael Davis, President - Brencom Strategic Business Consulting	2005-04-27

Davis <br /> <br />According to Bill Gates \\"Going digital will put you on the leading edge of a shock wave of change.\\" Maybe you missed the dot-com boom. Are you going to miss the Wireless boom - which will change the world a thousand times over. The time is now to seize opportunity and the \\"Killer App\\" will help you do it. <br /> <br />What exactly is a killer app? <br /> <br />\\"Killer App - a new application so powerful that it transforms industries, redefines markets, and annihilates the competition.\\" Not just a recent digital age phenomenon; inventions like the compass, moveable type, eyeglasses, the steam engine, and lightbulbs have impacted society in a huge way. Downes and Mui did a fantastic job of describing the characteristics of true killer apps and have aptly illustrated the degree of impact they can have on society. <br /> <br />You certainly don't have to look far to see that technology, particularly the Internet, is driving today's economy. Turn on CNBC, read Business Week or browse the Wall Street Journal - you'll find that technology is the prime force creating growth in almost every industry. <br /> <br />Downes and Mui argue that the dominant trend behind the proliferation of killer apps is a combination of Moore's Law (CPU processing power doubles every 18 months) and Metcalfe's Law (network value increases dramatically with each additional user.) These two laws are fundamentally changing how businesses interact with each other and with their customers. Owing to the today's rapidly changing business environment, business owners will inevitably lose out to competition if they're not utilizing the latest technology.  <br /> <br />Unleashing the Killer App is divided into three parts: <br /> <br />Digital Strategy <br />Designing the Killer App <br />Unleashing the Killer App <br /> <br />In Part I, there is a brief discussion of one \\"killer app\\" in the Middle Ages, the stirrup, which added mounted cavalry to the battle equation. The \\"lowly stirrup\\" played a singular role in rearranging the political, social, and economic structure of medieval Europe. <br /> <br />In Part II, what they refer to as \\"a few rules of thumb.\\" They suggest three stages of \\"killer app\\" design and carefully explain each. They identify 12 specific principles on which to base the design process. <br /> <br />In Part III, they shift their attention to \\"Unleashing the Killer App\\" and correctly stress the importance of communication, one which \\"speaks with the language of ideas, scenarios, options, and what-ifs.\\" <br /> <br />Think of and measure your daily operations as a series of unique transactions. Then focus on how these transaction costs can approach zero. With technology allowing for greater interactivity, the ability exists to create online communities where people can share in ways never imagined. <br /> <br />Unleashing the Killer App is an awesome book that will certainly make you think about ways to ride the waves of technological change surrounding us. With that said, it is prudent to consider both traditional and digital strategy, particularly in light of the Dot Com Bust, when developing strategic plans. Two interesting concepts are illustrated in Table 3.1 \\"Strategic Planning vs Digital Strategy,\\" p. 59 and Figure 3.1 \\"The New Forces,\\" p. 65. <br /> <br /> <br />Michael Davis, President - Brencom Strategic Business Consulting	2005-04-27

And, it was once cited as the \\"second most influential book for Americans today\\" after the Bible, according to a joint survey conducted by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club. <br /> <br />Ayn Rand tells an astounding story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world -- and did. Throughout her novel she tells a story not about the murder of a man's body, but about the murder and rebirth of man's spirit. <br /> <br />America is becoming complacent about its economic engine and is allowing, through non-production and over-consumption, itself to be overtaken by once lessor nations. <br /> <br />While it is a novel, Atlas Shrugged provides a vast amount of information on how \\"producers\\" create the world we live in. Throughout history it has been entrepreneurs who transformed our world from mere existence to modern luxuries. Through human thought; scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs unleash human greatness thereby raising mankind's standards of living exponentially. <br /> <br />It is the quest for money that drives entrepreneurs toward achieving greatness. According to John Galt (leading character) Capitalism, is \\"mutual trade to mutual advantage.\\" <br /> <br />One of my favorite quotes from Atlas Shrugged is: \\"Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper's bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one another-their only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun.\\" --Ayn Rand <br /> <br />This is definitely a novel for those truly seeking greatness. <br /> <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-04-08

Books	5	22	23	N	N	One of the most powerful books I've ever read.	Awaken The Giant Within is one of the most powerful books I've ever read. In December 1994, after winning a battle with cancer, I stood, nearly bald, in the audience of my first motivational seminar, conducted by Anthony Robbins. <br /> <br />Shortly after the seminar I read Awaken The Giant Within to learn more about taking charge of my destiny. To this day, I refer to this book often for inspiration and guidance. <br /> <br />Over the years, I've read and listened to lots of self-help material in my quest to discover the secret to success. Without question, this book provides the clearest and most incredibly inspiring ideas. Since reading this book, I've greatly increased my level of health (by becoming vegetarian), doubled my income, and formed my own consulting company. <br /> <br />Awaken The Giant Within consists of four sections: <br /> <br />Part One: Unleash your power <br />Part Two: Taking Control - The Master System <br />Part Three: The Seven Days to Shape Your Life <br />Part Four: A Lesson in Destiny <br /> <br />Although the book is quite long, it is a very exciting read. Starting off with \\"Dreams of Destiny\\" Robbins tells a story of how his life changed as a result of the principles he learned. He states \\"We all have dreams ... We all want to believe deep down in our souls that we have a special gift, that we can make a difference ...\\" Moving on, he explains, step-by-step, how to go about articulating what it is you want, the forces that shape our destiny, and how to harness the power within to create our own destiny. <br /> <br />In summary, what I enjoy most about Awaken The Giant Within, and all of Anthony Robbins' other works, is that he challenges you to test his ideas for yourself, instead of accepting ideas on blind faith. Also, I must clarify that Awaken The Giant Within (or any other book for that matter) WILL NOT magically make you successful. It requires YOU to work with the material, develop strategies, and most importantly - take action. <br /> <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-04-08

Sales ability often means the difference between success and failure for people starting a new business. In fact, you must be able to communicate your ideas to others to be successful. Also, you must instill a sense of \\"need\\" into the minds of your prospective customers so they will purchase your company's offering in sufficient quantity to convert wants into needs. Overall, this book offers great insight for the business owner. After scanning the book the business owner should give this book to each and every salesperson in their organization. <br /> <br />Tom Hopkins is considered one of the foremost experts in the world of Sales and in his book he shares much of his insider knowledge. \\"How to Master the Art of Selling\\" is an awesome book on the intricacies of selling. To be honest, it is somewhat hard-hitting and his approach to closing is on the assertive edge. When reading and applying the techniques in this book, or any other book, always adapt the information to the times. While written in 1982, it is still a timeless classic when tempered with today's knowledge - particularly in reference to closing. Today it's less about closing and more about opening relationships. <br /> <br />Rather than attempt to tell you all of what's in this classic, here are the contents: <br /> <br />1) What the profession of selling really is <br />2) The twelve sources of sensational selling success <br />3) Question right and sink your teeth into sales success <br />4) Creating the selling climate <br />5) Why don't I do what I know I should do? <br />6) Learn to love no <br />7) Referral prospecting <br />8) How to find fortune and felicity with the phone <br />9) A spectator sport buying is not <br />10) Put champion selling power in your presentations and demonstrations <br />11) Finessing the first meeting <br />12) Qualification is the key to Quota-Busting <br />13) The objection connection <br />14) Closing is sweet success <br />15) Twelve power closes for aspiring champions <br />16) A clutch for moneygrabbers <br />17) How to perspire less and profit more from paperwork <br />18) Fortune building starts with time planning <br />19) How to sell your way out of a slump <br />20) The most necessary skill of all <br />21) How to sell to the most important people you know <br />22) Five more power closes for aspiring champions <br /> <br />I'll leave you with this striking formula for success - G.O.Y.A. that is explained on page 265. <br /> <br />\\"Successful people begin where failures leave off.

His insights on innovation offer me constant inspiration as I write my own newsletter - titled Byvation, which means ... By Way of Innovation. <br /> <br />In a dramatic opening, Tom Peters says it's all about \\"I-N-N-O-V-A-T-I-O-N.\\" Peters is a legendary business guru for good reason, he tells it like it is. In \\"Circle of Innovation\\" Peters talks about how our world is now in a constant state of flux, and to prosper businesses must wake up and take action. <br /> <br />A very busy text, \\"The Circle of Innovation\\" contains hidden gems at every turn that may very well spell the difference between success and outright failure for your company. <br /> <br />Products and Services are quickly becoming commodities and being in a commodity business is a dangerous place to be. If you are to have any hope of success, you must offer a compelling reason for someone to do business with you and your company. <br /> <br />\\"The Circle of Innovation\\" offers tremendous insight on how to create compelling reasons for customers to do business with you.

They seem to be more afraid of life than death\\" - James F. Bymes <br />  <br />In the October 2003 issue my newsletter I reviewed, \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad.\\" Then I read \\"CASHFLOW Quadrant\\" which Kiyosaki's says is Part II in a three-part series. As I read the book I found it to be an \\"eye-opening\\" experience. <br /> <br />Financial success, or any other success for that matter, begins in the mind! The core idea is that there are four types of people in business: Employee, Self employed, Business Owner, and Investor. For quite some time I've advocated that Self-employed \\"Business Owners\\" are not really business owners because a business is a living entity unto itself and is not dependent on individuals. Kiyosaki takes that concept to the next level, explaining how employees (working for others or self) and business owners (and by extension, those who invest in businesses) think differently. <br /> <br />In the end it boils down to security versus risk. Employees are consumed with an overriding desire for security that they will stay in dreadful jobs rather than risk opening their minds to other opportunities. On the other hand, business owners and investors constantly seek new ideas and seize opportunities. One reason they are so successful is they do not try to do everything themselves. Instead, business owners and investors hire a team of professionals to assist in their quest for financial success. Kiyosaki says that \\"the true motto of a 'B' is, Why do it yourself when you can hire someone to do it for you, and they can do it better?\\" <br /> <br />\\"CASHFLOW Quadrant\\" is divided into three parts: <br /> <br />Part I - The CASHFLOW Quadrant. Maps out the E/S/B/I Quadrant to explain how Employees, Self-employed, Business Owners, and Investors think and behave differently. <br /> <br />Part II - Bringing Out The Best In You. Talks about how \\"Money is a drug.\\" And how \\"A diet will not help if your thoughts do not change.\\" <br /> <br />Part III - How To Be A Successful \\"B\\" and \\"I\\" Presents \\"THE 7 STEPS TO FINDING YOUR FINANCIAL FAST TRACK\\" which illustrates exactly how to take control of your mind and your financial freedom. <br /> <br />Whereas \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" offers inspiration, \\"CASHFLOW Quadrant is more about the \\"how-to's\\" of changing your view on work - hard or smart, and opening your mind to the unlimited possibilities surrounding each of us. <br /> <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-04-08

That's exactly what this book focuses on. For example, the authors advocate taking a major role in helping B2B customers reach their business goals. Through rapid innovation many products quickly become commodities. <br /> <br />Partnership is a whole new game for businesses ingrained in the old push concept of trying to berate customers into submitting to buying whatever the company offers. To be honest, Wilson's book will certainly be most useful to B2B (Business to Business) companies. However, it's not too hard to see numerous applications for B2C (Business to Consumer) companies. <br /> <br />Take the authors advice on why you should Put Customers Before the Boss. The customer really is king and companies should be organized around them, not towards always pleasing the boss. Stop Selling, Start Partnering is divided into three parts: <br /> <br />Part I. Permanent White Water <br /> <br />Part II. Imagining the Future <br /> <br />Part III. Incredible Results, More Effective People - The Strategic Abilities of the Future <br /> <br />The bottom line to this book is this: Yes, sales are important. However, it's high-time that companies recognize that customers are in the driver's seat - now more than ever. Entrepreneurs everywhere are staring at incredible opportunities as customers no longer put up with the traditional \\"me company, you customer\\" mentality. <br /> <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-04-06

Zygmont explains how Venture Capitalists offer more than just money, they offer expertise and connections. Starting off with An Adventure Capital Story, the author quickly gets to the point - Venture Capitalists are interested in rapid growth companies with potential for high impact, lifestyle companies need not apply. <br /> <br />Venture Capital is more than just about money. It's about changing the world we live in. Through money, experience in building companies, and cross-industry connections, VC's are able to bring to bear a tremendous amount of energy to effect change. <br /> <br />If you've ever wondered what Venture Capitalists really do, The VC Way will give you the insider's view. And if you're serious about transforming your ideas into market reality, you'll most likely need external funding from investors.

Recently I overheard a clueless manager of a local enterprise say that the reason the United States is losing jobs is that services don't create wealth, only manufacturing does. Wrong, our current economy (at least in developed countries) is very much knowledge driven. <br /> <br />According to Leadbeater, \\"most developed countries make money out of thin air: We produce nothing that can be weighed, touched, or easily measured.\\" Think about that for a minute and it'll be as bright as day. Internet services, telephone calls, accounting and legal advice are all examples of modern economic products that are weightless. According to the author, many products are weightless because they're comprised of service, judgment, information, and analysis. As an example, think about something as simple as cell phone ring tones on which consumers worldwide spent $3.5 billion in 2003. <br /> <br />Charles Leadbeater has given us a thoughtful and considered look at how the rules of our economy have radically shifted. Consider that the knowledge-creating company of the future will need to embrace eight principles: <br /> <br />1) Cellular Structure <br />2) Self-Management (especially important to motivated, educated, and ambitious professionals) <br />3) Entrepreneurship <br />4) Equity Pay and Membership <br />5) Deep Knowledge Reservoirs <br />6) Integration <br />7) The Holistic Company <br />8) Collaborative Leadership <br /> <br />\\"Collaboration is the driving force behind creativity. Learning, one of the most basic activities in the knowledge economy, is an essentially social activity: we learn with others and through others...\\" <br /> <br />All in all, The Weightless Society will certainly stimulate your thinking. For technology entrepreneurs, pay special attention to the information throughout the book on dematerialization because the new economy is driven by information. Ultimately we will continue to create more and more with less energy and material. <br /> <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-04-06

While larger companies may be able to coast for awhile on pure momentum (often risking long-term failure though); the opposite is true for entrepreneurs which have no such luxury. Entrepreneurs must be the hunter or end up being hunted. According to Hruby you must \\"Find new ways to apply technology and you'll leave your competition far behind.\\" <br /> <br />As an example, Hruby uses the simple sneaker. Thirty years ago sneakers were inexpensive canvas shoes that came in only a few designs and colors. Now sneakers seem to come in infinite varieties of colors, styles, and features. In fact, recently I've been reading how several sneakers are now integrated with computers to constantly adjust the shoes characteristics. <br /> <br />Using real-world stories from companies in dozens of industries, Technoleverage shows how wisely using technology may very well be the differentiating factor in exponential success. Technoleverage shows how to get technology under your business to literally \\"lift\\" its profits, visibility, size, and value. A technology-driven business strategy applies to all types of firms, whether they invent new technologies, manufacture technological goods, sell technological services, integrate technology for others, distribute technology -- or just plain use it. <br /> <br />Technology is a competitive weapon for entrepreneurs and it must be seen as exactly that - a weapon to be used to provide exceptional value to customers and reduce internal costs and inefficiencies. <br /> <br />Michael Davis - Editor, Byvation	2005-04-06

Leading the Revolution is not a calm analysis of what will or won't work in a post-industrial world. Instead, it's an impassioned call for revolutionary activists to shake the foundations of the status quo. <br /> <br />According to Hamel, there is no such thing as good enough. True innovation is the demolition and re-creation of an entire business concept. Like Competing for the Future (reviewed in Byvation, August 2003), Hamel's new book is visionary and forceful, showing how to create and run the companies of tomorrow. Comprised of four sections, \\"Leading the Revolution's\\" contents are: <br /> <br />I Facing Up to the Revolution <br /> <br />II Finding the Revolution <br /> <br />III Igniting the Revolution <br /> <br />IV Sustaining the Revolution <br /> <br />Barely ten years old, the World Wide Web is shaking the world's foundation.

While this book is targeted at classic corporate America, it will give entrepreneurs insight into how to take your creativity to the next level. Companies that encourage inspiration and innovation, and allow people to make a difference will soar high above others in the long-run. <br /> <br />Divided into four parts, Miller outlines how you can be more creative alone and more importantly - as part of a team. Miller organizes his book into four sections: <br /> <br />Breathe New Life into Your Work <br />Foster Breakthrough Innovation in Groups <br />Revitalize the Soul of Corporate Creativity <br />Keep the Faith - Integrate Profits and Prophets <br /> <br /> <br />William Miller also introduces a concept called the \\"Creative Journey\\" that is a four stage process through which every endeavor passes. This Creative Journey offers a framework for identifying a challenge, focusing on priority issues, generating creative ideas, and implementing them. What seems to be most important is the ability to ignite the internal fire within yourself and others to unleash the fullest potential of creativity. <br /> <br />Creativity is the fuel that drives innovation and energizes companies. As an entrepreneur it's important to remember that people become truly creative only when they decide \\"internally\\" to take personal responsibility for results. As you create and develop your leadership team, be sure to find people who are internally driven and committed to your company's core vision. <br /> <br />Michael Davis, Editor - Byvation	2005-04-05

Supermotivation is something that virtually any business needs, especially entrepreneurs who are in the enviable position of setting it up right from the start. <br /> <br />As a corporate \\"escapee\\" (paroled after serving 14 years in various companies, including several Fortune 500) I've witnessed firsthand the inept attempts of management. For example, new PC's and applications are constantly dumped on employees with little or no training. This is something that Spitzer addresses in Supermotivation. <br /> <br />Also, Spitzer knows that super motivation comes from within. One Regional Vice President of a Fortune 500 company where I worked once tried to motivate the company's associates by calling on us to exert discretionary effort. Unfortunately he obviously didn't read this book. To unlock maximum potential, associates need to be inspired from within. <br /> <br />Supermotivation is comprised of 12 easy to read chapters: <br /> <br />For entrepreneurs, every person needs to be at the peak of his or her game. There's not much time to get up to speed. That's why a book like Supermotivation can help get it right from the start. <br /> <br /> <br />Michael Davis, Byvation <br /> <br />---> To swing for the fence, entrepreneurs must avoid the shark-infested red water and sail into the deep blue sea.	2005-04-04

As founder of Microsoft; Gates is in a unique and powerful position to not only prognosticate, but he has the power to boldly shape the future. Like him or not, Gates deeply understands business, and particularly the software industry. Therefore I submit that it is wise to listen to what he says about the future. Digital convergence is in the air, shaping the very world around us. Bill Gates analyzes the consequences of the release of technology onto the economy and society at large. Gates makes it clear that the digital revolution takes no prisoners and that you must adapt to the unescapable digital revolution, or die. <br /> <br />Business @ the Speed of Thought is broken down into 23 chapters in 6 sections <br /> <br />I - Information Flow Is Your Lifeblood <br /> <br />II - Commerce: The Internet Changes Everything <br /> <br />III - Manage Knowledge To Improve Strategic Thought <br /> <br />IV - Bring Insight To Business Operations <br /> <br />V - Special Enterprises <br /> <br />VI - Expect The Unexpected <br /> <br />Business @ the Speed of Thought is an exciting read that will inspire you to take on the world. Gates makes it clear that we're near the beginning of a great revolution. If you think about it, the PC is fairly new and the Internet is in its absolute infancy. In fact, we're just beginning to discover what the computer can do for us. Gates says, and I certainly agree, that there will be many more billionaires created in the next generation. <br /> <br />- Excerpted from a more complete review in the March issue of Byvation	2005-03-29

Not only did he invent the world wide web (WWW), he gave it away. By forgoing a patent on the World Wide Web, Berners-Lee created a great system of networks based on open standards. The system he created single-handedly brought the world closer together, formed an electronic business community, and built a system that rivals all others in acting as a platform for future possibilities. If you're involved in creating internet based software or just want to open your mind to the possibilities created by the Internet - this is the book for you. <br /> <br />Named one of the greatest minds of the 20th century by Time, Berners-Lee offers a compelling portrait of his invention - the origins of www and http which we take for granted today. Also he shares his views on critical issues such as censorship, privacy, and the increasing power of software companies. As well he shares his feelings on the need to find the ideal balance between commercial and social forces. <br /> <br />Broken into 14 chapters, Weaving the Web is a thought-provoking read. <br /> <br />The last two chapters summarize Berners-Lee's vision for the future of the web. What you may find interesting is his original intent was not for the big companies to create content and everyone else to consume. If you're excited as me to the possibilities the web will bring in the future, you may want to continue your study by keeping up with Time Berners-Lee's current effort to remake the web into something truly grand: <br /> <br />Scientific American has an excellent article in the May 2001 issue <br />\\"The Semantic Web ... A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities\\" <br /> <br />Michael Davis, Byvation	2005-03-29

The book begins with \\"A powerful global conversation has begun. Through the Internet, people are discovering and inventing new ways to share relevant knowledge with blinding speed. As a direct result, markets are getting smarter-and getting smarter faster than most companies.\\" <br /> <br />One great thought in this book is that the Web makes it possible for everyone to participate in the \\"great conversation.\\" As such the web remains full of possibilities. We've only touched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to unlocking Tim Berners-Lee's dream of bringing people together. The several sections that comprise the Cluetrain Manifesto are: <br /> <br />The 95 Theses <br />Elevator Rap <br />Introduction <br />Chapter 1: Internet Apocalypso <br />Chapter 2: The Longing <br />Chapter 3: Talk Is Cheap <br />Chapter 4: Markets Are Conversations <br />Chapter 5: The Hyperlinked Organization <br />Chapter 6: EZ Answers <br />Chapter 7: Post-Apocalypso <br /> <br />A thought provoking book ... <br /> <br />Michael Davis, Byvation	2005-03-29
