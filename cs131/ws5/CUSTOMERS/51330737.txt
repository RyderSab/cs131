As a liturgist & liturgical author, her emphasis is on community & communal worship, on \\"God-for-us\\" rather than \\"God-for-me\\" or \\"God-Apart.\\" Involvement is her mission.  As a feminist, she has dedicated herself to rediscovering or creating non-sexist metaphors & images that are personally meaningful as well as useful in Christian hymns, prayers & art.  Dr. Ramshaw is an especially perceptive interpreter of Trinitarian concepts. One supposes she is more at home in the traditions & rituals of Lutherans, Anglicans, & Roman Catholics.  At heart the author is a midwestern \\"mainstream\\" Protestant, raised conservatively & strictly, who enjoys being devoutly - even habitually - observant,  & so reforms the forms she follows. She admits to this upfront, & gives us intimate, all-too-brief glimpses of her childhood throughout the book. Her writing is free of the ignorance, superstition & prejudice that are now epidemic in American Protestanism (& government). She takes a long & appropriately hopeful view of her chosen faith; that is, \\"chosen\\" over her doubts however mysteriously rather than imposed by divine injunction, or patriarch, or law, or from base fears.     These essays show great scholarship but are not academic tracts;  they are like hanging out with a favorite professor-friend.  An entertaining book, a fine teacher.

They would not be mean-spirited and, for example, blame gay people for the breakdown of the family, nor would they criminalize the choices of desperate women backed into difficult and dangerous corners. But the candidate would be decidedly pro-family, pro-life (meaning they really want to lower the abortion rate), strong on personal responsibility and moral values, and outspoken against the moral pollution throughout popular culture that makes raising children in America a countercultural activity. And what if that candidate was also an economic populist, pro-poor in social policy, tough on corporate corruption and power, clear in supporting middle-class and working families in health care and education, an environmentalist, and committed to a foreign policy that emphasized international law and multilateral cooperation over pre-emptive and unilateral war? What would you do?\\" I asked. The Republican strategist paused for a long time, and then said, \\"We would panic!\\" <br /> <br />That sums up the spirit, the \\"angel\\"  of this book. For Wallis, there is a fourth way in politics, beyond liberal, conservative & libertarian.  It is a \\"prophetic politics\\" rooted in tradition.  Jim Wallis is not a radical theologian. He's not trying to overturn The Apostles' Creed & reinterpret the Resurrection of Jesus Christ to make it compatible with the laws of physics as we understand them.  He does understand, as so many Christians from Paul of Tarsus to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King have understood, that just to live truly as an authentic Christian is a revolutionary act. Can you imagine a society that really does comfort the afflicted, feed the hungry,  heal the sick, & bless the peacemakers?   <br /> <br />Both the Right (who get it wrong, but not all wrong) & the Left (who don't get it, but still get some of it) have to expect & demand more, much more, from our leaders, who are shallow when they are not deceitful, absurd when they are not hypocritical, inarticulate when they are not stringing together cliches. <br />   <br />It's too easy to say Jim Wallis is liberal because he backs away from some \\"button\\" issues &  wants the government to partner with us as an agent for helping those desperately in need of practical & emotional sustenance.   The middle & wealthy classes of America are loaded with entitlements we are loathe to sacrifice, & would willingly keep at the expense of those who have little or nothing. Through his own group, Sojourners,  he also wants to bring people to Christ, but in the manner of the  old Jewish saying, \\"No bread without Torah, no Torah without bread.\\" That is, if Christians do what Christians are supposed to do, it's a lot easy to explain just what the \\"Good News\\" really is: That God's love is for everyone, & is most visibly expressed through our love for each other in community.  By the standards of popular culture, Wallis is quite old-fashioned; neither a \\"make your own religion\\" new ager nor  a mega-church pastor trying to fill the coffers & the parking lot,  but a visiting preacher with real world experience who  is justified in wanting to make us squirm a little bit & do some thinking when the service is over.	2005-01-26

For those who decry the triumph of the early church over pure gnosticism & Roman paganism, Pagels is your apple. Her scholarship is excellent. Of course, none of the \\"gospel\\" books were written by eyewitnesses, & The Thomas gospel is essentially a collection of purported sayings of Jesus from the early oral traditions.  The loss of the Christian oral tradition was indeed unfortunate, as it resulted in the patriarchal silencing of the Church's influential female voices. But we cannot say that these voices were primarily gnostic; that is a separate issue. The most serious flaw in gnostic belief was not in making Jesus first among, or equal to, many spiritual lights, but in denying his humanity; that since Jesus was perfect & no human could be perfect, therefore Jesus was not human.  This heretical mixture of neo-platonism & Eastern mystery cult turned the image of Jesus into a funhouse mirror reflection, making him, & therefore God, inaccessible to the common person. Certainly a most attractive proposition for intellectuals & spiritual seekers with the literacy, leisure & curiosity to browse & shop at the Supermarket of Religions. But not so good when one wants to bring people out of the chains of superstition; the religions of stonings, ritual puberty clitoral & penile circumcision, foot-binding, the seraglo & temple prostitution, shroudings, shunnings, blood sacrifices, murders-for-martyrdom, & the tyranny of priestly castes.   <br />Had it not been for those wise, devout, fearless & savvy people who brought together the Canon we know as the Bible, Christianity would have broken up early on into hundreds of theologically weak, vulnerable, small, contending esoteric sects, each promoting a particular \\"secret wisdom\\" rather than the open, welcoming gospel of Jesus; who if he had any \\"secrets\\" kept them to himself rather than making them criteria for knowing God, & who asks only for the trusting faith of a child. That disunity would have guaranteed the failure of the Gospel mission.  God did not allow it to happen. <br />I wouldn't mind if a few more books, like the fanciful Revelation to John of Patmos, James' attack on justification by faith, & Timothy's biases against women, were consigned to an appendix. In the present era, rampant sectarianism, crude American pop culture, & the flag-waving worship of granite war jehovahs are doing a fine job of ripping the Christian church - as well as other world faiths -  apart, to which Pagels only provides another crowbar & sledge hammer.  <br />Bob Rixon	2003-09-25

For some reason, this visionary book has kept its relevance for over fifty years (revised early Sixties).  A work of Goodman's youth, around the time he taught at Black Mountain College,  Communitas is by turns common sensical, prophetic, poetic, absurdly idealistic, & frequently (deliberately) hilarious.<br />What was so terribly dehumanizing about American cities (the model here is New York) in the Forties has not been corrected in any major way.  In the aftermath of 9/11, with that horrible, gaping hole where the Towers stood, one turns again to Communitas & reads about banning cars from New York, making the the city's avenues pedestrian & bike friendly, preserving good neighborhoods with indigenous personalities, & transforming other harsh, declining or gentrifying areas into safe, humane areas that are welcoming & which provide homes, schools & shopping areas that erase racial & class divides.<br />The Goodmans eagerly to take on Frank Lloyd Wright, Bucky Fuller, the international & all the other various schools of designs for living then current. They reach back to earlier American, British & European models of community that showed promise through their partial successes.<br />This is a deeply felt & humane call for holistic, human-sized communities within our cities.  Ultimately, the solutions may not be so grandiose as some of those suggested here.  But the World Trade Center Towers, awesome as they were, were coldly & absurdly beyond human scale;  symbols of our subservience to a system of economics that is usually blind to basic human requirements; gigantic obstacles to the simple warmth of an afternoon's sunshine.  I suspect Paul Goodman despised them.	2002-09-14

For three-hundred years following the life of Jesus, it was nearly unthinkable for a Christian to become a soldier, much less participate in war. Then, Christianity gained control of the Roman Empire &amp; its legions. Justification for Pax Romana was needed, &amp; Augustine provided it with his &quot;just war&quot; requirements. There has been no war in history which has met all of those requirements. <br />Perhaps the most significant &quot;military moment with God&quot; occurred when a junior officer in the Roman Army, his name was Martin from Tours, put down his weapons the day before a battle, offering instead to stand, defenseless except for a Cross, between the opposing armies. Fortunately, a truce was worked out that night. <br />There is more truth to that story than to the one in this book recounting in detail the meeting between Big Chief George Washington &amp; the Big Chief of the native American warriors, formerly allied with the French, who had wiped out half of young Washington's command &amp; nearly killed the future Father of Our Country. <br />This is how what should be an accurate, dispassionately written book, in which authentic spiritual experiences stirringly speak for themselves, becomes historically suspect. Too bad.<br />As for there being &quot;no atheists in foxholes,&quot; my brother steadfastly maintains that he remained one during his year in &amp; around Pleiku. The nearness of death does not inspire religious faith in everyone. Sometimes there's only terror followed by resignation.	2001-09-29

The book ends with a short, thoughtful essay of summation &amp; 40 pages of fine print notes.<br />Other chapters are: Jesus &amp; the Christian Promise; Irenaeus &amp; Augustine on our Heavenly Bodies; Medieval Promises; The Pleasures of Renaissance Paradise; God at the Center: Protestant &amp; Catholic Reformers; Swedenborg &amp; the Emergence of Modern Heaven; Love in the Heavenly Realm; Eternal Motion: Progress in the Other World.<br /><br />Especially intriguing is how our concepts of heaven reflect our ideals  &amp; hopes in Earthly life. Christian Heaven is hardly static. It has something for everyone, from estatic, egoless communion with the Divine Spirit, to endless angelic songs of praise, to the middle class family unit in a perfected state. &amp; yes, Grandpa sitting on a cloud watching over us.<br /><br />Some denominations make claims as to the definitive knowledge of our post-mortal destination.

This lovely book has been around for about ten years. Stephane Rossini is a scholar, but her purpose here is more practical, I think.

This is the foundation of Williams' art, for fans of his selected & Pictures from Brughel.       This is the development of Williams' daily art, fine poems punctuated by an occasional masterpiece or near-surrealistic gemstone. Someone once asked John Cage, \\"With your methods, couldn't anyone compose music?\\" Cage replied, \\"Yes, but they don't.\\" Many of Williams' poems make that impression. Where I live, in New Jersey, Williams is so ingrained in the literary landscape that no poet is more imitated, even if the imitator is unaware of the influence.  Williams was better at setting examples than at explaining methods. He learned & invented as he wrote, & I suspect his talk & his letters had a great deal more influence than his occasional stabs at poetics.    Williams stripped down American poesy & reconstructed it as a form of talk, which it had been all along beneath Whitman's yawping & Dickinson's obsessive editing & Frost hiking though New England snow five steps at a time.  Like all great American originals, he didn't know he was supposed to be a somebody-else; maybe a Stephen Benet, a William Vaughn Moody, an Edwin Arlington Robinson, all big literary stars in their time but not now counted in the first ranks of our poets.

The power of being which is manifest in such courage is so great that the gods tremble in fear of it.&quot; Paul Tillich, The Courage to Be.<br />Paul Tillich's ideas are a response to existentialism, German philosphy, modern physics &amp; the success of totalitarian movements in Germany, Russia &amp; Italy. He is a bridge between the 19th Century &amp; the growth of new theological thought in latter part of the Twentieth. <br />Tillich is not all that difficult to understand in The Courage to Be. However, it's unfortunate that his three wonderful collections of sermons (The Shaking of the Foundations; The New Being; The Eternal Now) are out-of-print, as these are his best introductions. <br />Readers coming to Tillich will have to grapple with the common metaphors of Christian faith. For Tillich, the concepts of Heaven &amp; even an afterlife are not terribly important, as they imply a continuation of life in time that he is not able to accept scientifically or on faith. So one meets those lovely semi-metaphors of &quot;being itself,&quot; &quot;non-being&quot; &amp; &quot;ground of being&quot; that, for me at least, were a more clear explanation of how I experience the world than God the &quot;Father&quot; or Holy Ghost. <br />This makes Tillich a crucial step into Feminist &amp; Language theology, although he couldn't quite make the big leap himself. <br />Basically, Tillich says we're stuck in an undefinable present that moves creatively into an unknown future in which nothing is a given but the fact that we are alive right now, so what do we intend to do about it? This is &quot;being&quot; &amp; being, above all else, requires courage; the courage of early Christians facing the axe or the fire. As for Tillich's &quot;Ground of Being,&quot; one might compare it - inadequately - to a tree as a reflection of its roots - a metaphor I copped from another Paul ...artist Paul Klee. Tillich says thatwe cannot speak unsymbolically about being.<br />In the aftermath of September 11, 2001,  Paul Tillich's theology gains even greater relevance. He witnessed in Germany the acquiescence of the established churches to National Socialism &amp; the failure of Democratic Christian Socialism. I do not believe he would have many kind words for contemporary Islam, a religious system so bound to orthodoxy as to make it incapable of relevant reform. On the other hand, Tillich would have immediately recognized those manifestations of the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; which began appearing even before the Twin Towers had collapsed. Our estrangement from God in the Eternal Now (which invites demonic energy as a tall tree invites lightning) is overcome only in the present moment. Evil may be defeated with violent retaliation, but it is conquered with love. <br />Paul Tillich is especially liberating for artists. Stopping just short of Buddhism, Tillich makes the world look shimmeringly alive &amp; filled with possibilities, yet so transient - a world of appearances.<br />&quot;The courage to be is rooted in the God who appears when God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt.&quot; Paul Tillich, The Courage to Be<br />Bob Rixon<br />Also recommended&quot; Henri Bergson, An Introduction to Metaphysics	2000-09-09

It has two very serious flaws. It vastly under-represents women  &amp; poets of color. It also creates arbitrary &quot;schools&quot; of  poetry that hardly existed then &amp; exist not at all now. In the year  2000, the purpose of this book is perhaps not so clear. Except for Olson,  these are all early poems from young poets, many of whom are quite dead  now. This anthology is hardly a fair representation of, or introduction to,  their art.<br />But there are two strengths at work here. The New American  Poetry is a marvelous historical document of a particular time, an exciting  moment in American literature. Also, there are many poets here who  subsequently had wonderful careers without attaining the celebrity of Allen  Ginsberg, John Ashbury or Robert Creeley. Some of the finest poets in this  book have pitifully few of their own best books in print .. the delights of  their smaller collections. So the reader may be encountering Helen Adam,  Larry Eigner, Ron Lowensohn, Ray Bremser &amp; Joel Oppenheimer for the  first time. Or become reacquainted with Paul Blackburn &amp; Denise  Levertov.<br />Even when you keep in mind that the New American Poetry is  neither an infallible literary bible of its time nor a substitute for  broader anthologies like The Voice that is Great Within Us, the beautiful  music it contains will still pack a wallop to your heart &amp; mind.<br />Bob  Rixon	2000-08-18

Bamboo,  Wild Orchid, Chrysanthemum &amp; Plum Branch represent &quot;all the forms  in the universe.&quot; One could endlessly write haiku on those four  natural forms, so why not paintings, too?<br />This book is as clear as a  mountain brook &amp; as gentle as a breeze. Successfully achieving a bamboo  branch &amp; leaf (&amp; you will succeed) is enough to draw you onward  down that right path. Even children can grasp the basics of these strokes  using inexpensive brushes &amp; watercolors, &amp; they will wonder at the  simplicity of it. <br />Just as poets return again &amp; again to haiku in  order to sharpen their observation skills &amp; sense of economy, all  artists will reap large benefits from the spare, mono-chromatic beauty of  Sumi-E that will enrich your other mediums &amp; quiet your mind as well.  <br />Highly recommended. <br />Bob Rixon	2000-08-13

I wonder if that's Irwin's subtext?<br />Irwin has also compiled a CD soundtrack for \\"Songs in the Key of Z.\\" Get that, too, so you can scat along with Shooby Taylor, the Human Horn. <br />Bob Rixon	2000-07-07

It made an indelible impression on me. I cannot drive the Jersey coast without wondering how much of the ugly, new beachfront development will survive a great Jersey storm. Like many other  shore lovers, I secretly hope not much of it will.  The most  hair-raising tales in this wonderful book are from that 1962 whopper. But  these great storms have hit Jersey shores throughout the ages with  regularity, with & without warning, everywhere on the coast, changing  the coastline & serving important ecological purposes. Even Keansburg,  a bayshore town, has been knocked flat.   So enjoy the stories &  eye-popping photographs. But don't overlook the other message the authors  are conveying: We build castles on the sand.	2000-07-07

There is something of a suburbanite in Whitman's  appreciation of nature; essentially, he simply went, looked around &amp;  wrote down what he saw &amp; what he did. Force of nature that he was, what  he mostly saw was, of course, himself. Nature is benign.  The Civil War  entries are famous. The real war, which Whitman said would never get in the  books, makes an appearance in the sad hospitals he visited. <br />Specimen  Days is an inspiring message to us. Whitman knew we would be here. <BR>  <BR> Bob Rixon	2000-05-10

A fine generalist introduction to the metaphors of the sky. Generalist because it is concerned with more than western astrological symbols. At this stage in human history, with our emerging global viewpoint &amp;  understanding of the Earth itself as a living being, astrologers, too, must  allow their knowledge to expand &amp; deepen. We are slowly passing out of  the Piscean Age &amp; into Aquarius, &amp; that means irresistable changes.  Those with pagan or wiccan inclinations need a less Eurocentric  comprehension of sky spirituality. The Secret Language of Stars and  Planets, while rooted in the Western Zodiac, takes a multicultural path  beyond those borders. So all of the Planets are provided with some  identifications from Chinese, Egyptian, Incan, Indian &amp; Pre-Columbian  cultures, though not in especially great detail. Still, the artwork is  lovely (if a bit less so than Dr. Fontana's &quot;The Secret Language of  Symbols&quot;) &amp; the information is accurate.<br /><br /> The really  outstanding part of this book is the section on Sacred Alignments. The  astronomical designs and spiritual purposes of  twenty seven ancient sites  are explored. In addition to the obvious ones like The Great Pyramid,  Stonehenge &amp; Avebury, the book explains the layouts of such far flung  power centers as Hashihaka in Japan, Vijayanagara in India, the Cahokia  mound complex in Illinois, the Chaco Canyon &quot;Ancient Ones&quot; area  in the Four Corners region, and several South American sites including  Machu Picchu. Just enough to stimulate one's curiousity for more learning.<br /><br /> These wise, ancient peoples experienced the world in ways that  are difficult for us to know. But we must try. To do so, we have to get  past our limited geo-political views. Gaia deserves no less. The sky  belongs to no one. The sky belongs to everyone.<br /><br /> Bob Rixon	2000-05-05

Originally published in 1934 as &quot;Photographs by Man Ray 1920 Paris 1934,&quot; this collection is an  excellent look at his photo work during his most adventurous years. The  book is divided into five sections: general subjects; the female figure;  women's faces; celebrity portraits; rayographs.<BR> <BR> Man Ray's female  figures are an offbeat take on the male gaze in which the processes are as  sexy as the women.  Along with his female faces, they demonstrate why Man  Ray was much in demand by fashionable magazines. The &quot;celebrity&quot;  portraits are of his fellow male artists &amp; writers, with the exception  of Gertrude Stein - who can hardly be glamorized anyway. The rayographs  were created by placing objects directly on film, but the experimental  nature of Man Ray's art is seen throughout this inexpensive book from Dover  Publications. Picasso, Eluard, Breton, Tzara &amp; Rrose Selavy a.k.a.  Marcel Duchamp contributed texts. Highly recommended. <BR> <BR> Bob Rixon	2000-02-28

Fully one-half of this fine book is given to draftsmanship.  She begins with proportions of the  head (male, female &amp; infant) in Chapter One, then moves on to drawing  features -- with special attention given to the windows of the soul, the  eyes.  Chapter Three is dedicated to drawing the body. In Chapter Four, Ms.  Clark presents the difficult skill of capturing fabric folds. Chapter Five  covers lighting for four different views. Charcoal portraiture comes next,  then using color, stepping through hue, value, intensity, &amp; flesh &amp;  hair tones. <BR> <BR> Finally, she devotes chapters to painting portraits  from life in oils &amp; in watercolors.

Davis presents an excellent  compilation of his own works, each one examining a mystery (The Flaming  Door, Seat of the Soul, Sacred Water), goddess &amp; god, metaphor (the  Green Man), archetype, animal totem or decorative motif (Unfolding Growth,  Cosmic Loom). The book includes illustrations Davis created for works about  Merlin &amp; Grail Quest symbols, along with excepts of text &amp; poetry  from those books.

Stewart unveils some of this mystery for  us. It is well-researched, with excellent color illustrations. Substantial  excerpts from Celtic literature - mostly oral tales reflected in a  Christian mirror - are included. There is special emphasis on the Celtic  goddess figures, who are rather slippery to grasp with their triple aspects  &amp; mixes of fertility &amp; warrior powers. The preCeltic origins of the  Mother Goddess &amp; the connections between Celtic &amp; Roman myth  (Minerva/Brigid) are explored. <br />This is not a &quot;Bible&quot; of Celtic  religion. No such book exists or ever existed. Anyone trying to invent an  easy cut &amp; paste &quot;pagan&quot; spirituality will probably find this  book a difficult read.

A large amount of photographs must have been ruined in the rain  &amp; mud. Brady mostly points his camera at the terrible aftermath of  battle, at bodies &amp; broken barricades, but there is one rare photo that  may have been shot during Antietam. Brady is present at an out door  gathering of Grant and his generals (Brady calls it a &quot;War  Council,&quot; but Grant never put his plans up for a vote. We see a  defeated Lee, his great dignity intact. The Grand Review marches past. The  Lincoln conspirators are hanged.

Jim Cohn's first book, a wonderfully ragged compilation capped by the troubled identity of the title character, a soaring bird awed by natural wonder &amp; cursed by an empathy with the suffering world below. For Cohn,  love plays out upon an arcing continuum &amp; is not to be categorized.  This truth gives Cohn his great range, encompassing as many moments of his  experiences as he can get into words. He is not concerned if his poems  wander from baseball to the high mountains &amp; then into cramped  apartments where small gestures assume the proportions of Times Square  billboards. Nor does it matter if at one moment he expresses a quiet,  Buddhist acceptance of events while in the next he is screaming because  someone cuts out his heart &amp; squeezes it. His contradictions are so  human that they build a strong trustworthiness between himself &amp; the  reader. Without trust, poetry is useless. <BR> <BR> Bob Rixon	1999-11-29

The waves are works of art. Those distant surfers  weren't environmentalists, but they, more than anyone, were witnesses to  what is now lost. Don James was a genius even when he taking snapshots.	1999-10-03

Without a doubt the most fascinating book I have ever read on what happens out on those little sand islands in Jersey's bays. Why? Because Joanna Burger took a few supplies out in a little boat &amp; lived on one. She  followed the dream of so many young human &quot;shorebirds&quot; who longed  to escape the crowded beaches &amp; waterfront developments to see where  the birds lived. This isn't polite ecology with fine line drawings &amp;  quotations from Thoreau, but hot piles of sands baking in the sun &amp;  wretched North Atlantic winter weather. <BR> <BR> By going to the heart of  our shore's natural beauty, Burger also finds the ongoing threats. True,  the waterfowl population has increased over the past 40 years, several  species at the expense of others. But road runoff is killing the bays &amp;  so-called &quot;personal watercraft&quot; (jet skis) are wrecking  intertidal wetlands, creating incredible noise pollution &amp; bringing  hundreds of knuckleheads into first contact with the wildlife that has  found relative safety from human interference in our back bays, estuaries  &amp; marshes. <BR> <BR> I can't emphasize strongly enough the importance  of Burger's writings. They should be taught in our schools &amp; be  required reading for everyone who ventures out on to the wonderlands that  exist behind our stressed out barrier islands.<BR> <BR> A beautiful &amp;  unique book. The birds love her &amp; so do I. Give this scientist a laurel  wreath, if you can find her. <BR> <BR> Bob Rixon, WFMU-FM	1999-08-23

Baker was a handsome, photogenic young man, a rising jazz star whose cool vocal interpretations of standards were  winning him a large, mostly female audience outside of jazz. These  beautiful black &amp; white photographs, both casual &amp; posed, capture a  cultural era as surely as do the films of James Dean, the recordings of  Elvis Presley &amp; the writings of Jack Kerouac. We often think of the  Eisenhower years as a bland era in the United States, but this talented  proto-punk musician was working nearer the fringes in an atmosphere of  creative ferment. Claxton saw it happening &amp; knew what was going on.  Lovely book for Baker's fans &amp; for those who appreciate fine portraits.  <br />Bob Rixon, WFMU-FM	1999-08-21

Richard Corliss, the slaveholder, offered three pounds  reward for the capture and return of Titus.  Titus did return, but as  Colonel Tye, and he fought gallantly in the Battle of Monmouth, near  Freehold. A year later, Colonel Tye did something even more extraordinary.  Once again he returned to Monmouth County as leader of an integrated  guerilla unit. Tye's intimate knowledge of Monmouth County swamps, rivers  and woods served him well, as he and his group plundered the farms and  estates of wealthy slaveholders, escaping to a hide out on Sandy Hook.  These depredations continued for a year until Tye received a bullet wound  and died of lockjaw. Tye would be an honored figure in American history but  for one problem: This was the Revolutionary War, not the Civil War, and Tye  was fighting on the British side. As far as he was concerned, Tye was  fighting for the right side. On November 7, 1778, the Earl of Dunmore,  Governor of Virginia, promised freedom to all slaves &quot;willing to serve  His Majesty's forces to end the present rebellion.&quot; If you had been a  slave, which side would you have chosen? An embryonic nation apparently  committed to slavery and largely governed by slaveholders, or a powerful  maritime empire that promised you your freedom? This wonderful story about  a courageous man, which I had never heard before, comes from an eye-opening  book by Graham Russell Hodges, &quot;Slavery and Freedom in the Rural  North: African Americans in Monmouth County, 1665-1865,&quot; from Madison  House Publishers in cooperation with the Friends of the Monmouth County  Park System.  Hodges lets the facts speak for themselves. From census  figures, newspaper accounts, county and church records, business ledgers,  wills, and reward postings for the capture of escaped slaves, we are  reminded that New Jersey was a rural state that had much in common with the  upper South - Lincoln never carried New Jersey. We did not have large  plantations, but slaveholding was common and acceptable enough to make us  closer to tidewater Maryland and Virginia than to New England in many of  our attitudes.  Slavery received an early start in New Jersey and rooted  strongly enough to end slowly, grudgingly and later than any other  Northeastern states. Vestiges of servitude lingered on into the Twentieth  Century, with many African Americans economically bound to the same white  families that had once owned them as property.  Hodges gives particular  attention to the role played by organized religion in the justification and  maintenance of slavery, as well as in its gradual demise. The second part  of Hodges' book deals with New Jersey's emancipation period, which saw a  declining slave population and the growing strength of Monmouth County's  free black community up to the Civil War. Local tax rolls reveal an  increasing number of mostly poor, yet free, African Americans, a few of  whom managed to acquire considerable farm acreage. Tables throughout the  book show the distribution of free and slave populations by town and by  year. Poet William Carlos Williams advises that we will find what is  universal by examining what is found locally. By taking a magnifying glass  to the 200 year history of slavery in a single New Jersey county, Graham  Russell Hodges brings to light the degradation, violence, hypocrisy, and  moral ambiguities of a terrible institution as it was experienced in this  state, by people we would have known or even could have been. Its pages are  filled with surnames still listed in our telephone books. It is a powerful  book. Bob Rixon, WFMU-FM, Jersey City, NJ	1999-07-23

I cannot drive the Jersey coast without wondering how much of the ugly, new  beachfront development will survive a great Jersey storm. & I secretly  hope not much of it will.  The most hair-raising tales in this book are  from that 1962 whopper. But these great storms have hit Jersey shores  throughout the ages with regularity, with & without warning, everywhere  on the coast, changing the coastline & serving important environmental  purposes.
