Sure, you can get free maps from yahoo, mapquest or google, but when you're heading through El Monte and the 10 is blocked up, no website is going to help you find an alternate route.  <br /> <br />It's also handy for locating a nearby post office, or most significant landmarks (the major stores at malls are identified by code, even, which helped my wife find a nearby Sears when she needed to make an exchange). <br /> <br />My only complaint is that the included CD-ROM version of the maps is Windows-only. They're considering a Mac version, but it'll likely be a year or two before we see it.	2005-03-02

Forget the questions. If you're living in Southern California you need this. It's handy for doing things like finding alternate routes (do you know how to get from Santa Fe Springs to Hollywood when the 5 and the 101 are packed?) <br />The CD is windows-only so as Mac guy I've not had the chance to use it. I'd be surprised if it was a significant improvement over the on-line map services, but perhaps it is.<br />The fold-out map (not sure if this is in the newer editions, I have mine from my 1990 and 1996 Thomas Guides in my car) is really nice if only because it more clearly delineates the city boundaries than the overview maps in the book do.	2004-07-15

Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum covered much of the same ground much more creditably and didn't rely on as absurd of a conspiracy to make it all come together. The crediting, for example, of the biblical canon to Constantine was rather laughable, as anyone who has studied the history of the biblical canon would agree.<br /><br />If you thought this was a good book, do yourself a favor. Get Foucault's Pendulum and read the story done right.	2003-10-10

I nearly put the book down at that point, but I have a tradition of reading a &quot;pope novel&quot; every August and this was this year's book. <br />The characters are largely two dimensional, but show some unrealized promise (unlike, say the characters in Andrew Greeley's White Smoke, who are irredeemably two dimensional). It's kind of amusing at times to spot the obvious substitutions. The most amusing of which is Flynn's Father Farrell, an obvious parody of Andrew Greeley for whom Flynn has little sympathy. <br />It wasn't until I was finished that I read the dust jacket and discovered that Flynn was a former ambassador to the Vatican. It explains the prominence of the US ambassador to the Vatican in the narrative (in this case, it's a fictionalized version of Richie Daley who's been made virtually a saint(!)).<br />In the whole the novel is a pretty quick read, handicapped largely by an effort to tackle too much in the space that's allotted so that no plot points really get developed. Flynn's manifesto for the church is an interesting mix of progressive and conservative, although he manages to miss out on some doctrinal points: Trivially, camerlengo is misspelled throughout, and the feast of the Assumption appears both in its correct month and also in December (I assume that Immaculate Conception was meant here). A bit more significantly, one central plot point turns around the idea that the status of children from an annulled marriage is an unresolved question (it's not--they're legitimate). <br />Still, I managed to laugh at the humor (intended and unintended) and it wasn't a bad way to spend a weekend's reading. I would suggest getting it at the library though.	2001-08-07

This, in part, explains the fact that between the publication of the first and second volumes, the size of the work had expanded to three volumes with the second volume being far more detailed than the first. <br />In writing this work, West has come at it with the view that his readers would likely be familiar with the other biographies and makes frequent reference to them (including scathing rebuttals to claims made in Shelden's travesty of a biography). This ends up creating a work which helps fill in the gaps that were unavoidable in Sherry volume 1 and makes this an essential companion to Sherry's work for the serious Graham Greene scholar (or fan).	2001-06-19

This book is aimed at the second group.

Focusing primarily on the lead-up to Roosevelt's third term through his death, Kearns manages to provide enough detail and background to keep the reader informed and engaged throughout. <br />It is, though somewhat disturbing while reading this to realize how far to the right the US as tacked in the last 60 years.	2001-06-05

I told him that if he was making any claims that people might dispute, he should footnote the h... out of it. Michael Shelden doesn't do this. His biography is full of controversial claims but his critical apparatus is very weak. In fact, one of his claims, that a gardener at an uncle's home was a central figure in his life, doesn't seem to have any documented source at all. <br /> If the claims were restricted to gardeners, this would not be an important detail, but Shelden makes an assortment of claims, identifying Greene as a homosexual, an antisemite, a closet fascist, and even insinuates that Greene was a murderer as well. Of all of these claims, only the antisemitism claim seems to have any merit and what merit there exists is for a weaker antisemitism than Shelden claims. The claim of homosexuality doesn't jibe with Shelden's own account of Greene's life. <br /><br />Perhaps most amusing is that while Shelden is eager to point out Greene's fondness for deception, he doesn't seem to acknowledge the possibility that he himself was being deceived.	2001-04-23

Unfortunately, this particular translation (by Trueblood) is quite execrable. Translating poetry is dicey business at best and is perhaps best handled with a literal translation and occasional footnotes.

I first learned about the Catholic Worker when I stumbled across a copy of the newspaper in a dorm lounge while I was still in college. The front page included a story about St Julian of Norwich and how she was one of the first mystics to view God as both Father and Mother. I don't remember if this was before or after I had made the decision to become Catholic, but it stuck with me.  <br /> The Catholic Worker has managed to continue to haunt my life. The priest who welcomed me into the church was/is deeply involved with the Los Angeles Catholic Worker, although I found my way there independently of his influence--in fact the first time I met him there was a bit of a surprise. My first visit to the LACW also turned up a friend from college, surprisingly enough. <br /> The Catholic Worker differed from other liberal Christian movements in that for them, religion was not merely something on which to hang a liberal doctrine. Rather, there doctrine flowed out of the spring of religion, and has a depth that other groups which I have worked with lacked.  <br /> This book gives an accounting of the history of the movement from its founding by Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day until the early seventies. Always a fascinating story, this accounting is a bit drier than the others since it places a bit of distance between itself and its subject (as opposed to Rosalie Troester's &lt;cite&gt;Voices from the Catholic Worker&lt;/cite&gt; which is as close to the subject as can be<br />accomplished). Still, as a comprehensive account, it does a lot to help establish the broader contexts of many of the events in the history of the Catholic Worker. <br /> An interesting note for the hagiographers: The parallels between the development of the Catholic Worker and the early years of the Franciscans are astounding.	2001-04-17

As ATF, Monotype and Linotype reached their ascendancy, new types were commissioned at an unprecedented rate and many of the best designs were created (or re-created) for the current generation of typesetting equipment. The advent of phototype in the 60s brought this first twentieth century golden age to an end, while PostScript opened a new period. Latter day type designers are cursorily treated courtesy of a second edition (which you're looking at here), so for that end of the spectrum you'll have to look elsewhere (the book has not yet been written), but it does at least provide a good overview of the major figures of the end of the metal type era.	2001-01-18

The idea being that you would be able to write code that looks like: &lt;code&gt;  for(i=0; i&lt;n; i++) {    @&lt;Process array element |i|@&gt;@;  } &lt;/code&gt; so that you can defer exactly what processing an array element entails until a point where it makes sense. Since these redirections are handled by a preprocessor, there's no cost at run-time for doing that like there would be if the code were written with a function call.	2000-12-12

For anyone who's still interested in creating fonts with Metafont, this volume is essential as a model as the most extensive use of the program.	2000-12-12

Yes, you can reproduce (almost) the book from the source code (and get a printout that includes post-publication bugs fixes and enhancements), but it's not quite as convenient and lacks the page-by-page mini-indices. Whether the convenience is worth [the money] is up to you. <br /> Where the book is especially helpful is for someone who's looking to see graphical algorithims spelled out by a master programmer in a literate and enteratining way. Me, I've got the full 5 volume set of TeX/MF books, but then, once upon a time, this was how I made my living.	2000-12-12

It's not exhaustive (it tends to be focused on the basic european instruments so includes e.g., violins, brass and guitars, but omits the cuatro, ney, sitar, etc.) but seems to be error-free. It won't necessarily obviate occasional discussions of capabilities of the instrument with a player, but is quite handy nevertheless. This is exactly the book that I wish I had twenty years ago.	2000-11-03

It's worth noting that this is geared towards  practitioners treating members of the gay &amp; lesbian community and is  *not* (thankfully) a guide to &quot;conversion therapy&quot;.	2000-09-12

Freeread being a few bits from DS' Barrel Fever. It's not really quite the same sort of material that I'm accustomed to from This American Life et al. The opening piece is a homoerotic fantasy about DS's codependent relationships with various celebrities and frankly falls a bit flat. I only read three pieces selected at random &amp; I'm comparing them to cherry-picked pieces on TAL, but it seemed to fall short of my expectations. I'd certainly recommend seeing for yourself before ordering this book blind. What I read far from measured up to the various radio pieces that anyone reading this is likely to be familiar with.	2000-05-23

There's some passably interesting information on consulting and general issues, but this is a horrible book to attempt to learn VFP programming from.	1997-09-23
