It is as if Wolfe had a manuscript lying around unfinished and some cohort of his said \\"I dare you to end it using [X] plot device,\\" and Wolfe took up the challenge.<br />Nor did I find his characterizations really compelling.  \\"Mr Barnes\\" is the most fully fleshed out of the four protagonists, but all four seem like facets of a single individual, not four distinct people driven by their individual motivations.<br />That all said, it was an interesting read, and more accessible than Gene Wolfe's heavier fiction.  It is atypical among Wolfe's work for its lightness and clarity of prose.	2003-02-03

It's half a book about Perl debugging, and half a book with more general advice, all pleasantly blended together.  Peter and Ed take you on an unrivaled tour of the ups and downs of Perl debugging.  It's sort of like Effective Perl Programming's &quot;Debugging&quot; chapter except hugely and brilliantly expanded.  It's comprehensive and imaginative without being pedantic.  It covers the Perl debugger (of course), it covers the different types of errors you'll encounter in Perl programs, it covers debugging strategies, and (very important) it covers the always-icky topic of debugging CGI programs.  And some other topics ....<br />Even experienced Perl programmers will enjoy reading this book.  You may think you've seen it all but I guarantee you that you haven't seen all of the examples of weirdness featured herein.  It reminds me of Kon and Bal's debugging &quot;brainteasers&quot; in Apple's now defunct Develop magazine.<br />I *highly* recommend Perl Debugged to anyone at the beginning or intermediate stage in Perl programming, particularly to programmers who have less than 2-4 years of debugging experience in general.  An experienced programmer, on the other hand, will want to buy a copy (copies?) to browse and then hand to his junior co-worker(s) with stern instructions to &quot;read first, code later.&quot;  (Reminds me of the time I bought Bugs in Writing.)<br />Apparently the authors have a way with words.  The prose is unusually good--not just by the standards of technical books--colorful, extremely clear, and enjoyable to read.  (The illustrations by Peter's sister-in-law are great.)  About the only thing that &quot;bugs&quot; me is the authors' use of &quot;semantical&quot; in preference to &quot;semantic.&quot;	2001-05-14

One test is whether  the author can explain normalization in a way that is (a) understandable to  the book's lay audience, (b) mostly accurate, and (c) mostly devoid of  references to relational formalism (which is &quot;relatively&quot; hard  even for C.S. majors to grok).  The Practical SQL Handbook passes that  test.  Many don't.  (I venture to say that most don't.)<br />The Practical SQL  Handbook is a good tutorial and &quot;cookbook&quot; of--as  advertised--very practically oriented SQL.  It won't turn you into a  database designer.  But on the other hand it won't severely mislead you  either.  It will certainly give you every opportunity to learn the basics  of SQL and a bit more, and it does so with a friendly and straightforward  style.<br />I don't think this is a brilliant book, but many competing books  are awful.  I'd give it 4 stars on an absolute scale, but for its relative  merit, it gets a full 5.	2000-08-13

Are you going to get the incredibly clever and funny author of The Client?  Or are you going to get the somber and plodding author of The Chamber?<br />I don't know, but  The Brethren is neither funny nor somber.  The two plot lines (prison mail  fraud and a rigged presidential election) are so far-fetched that you're  dying for signs that you should take it all tongue-in-cheek, but by the  time you get to the end it's more like head-up-rear.  None of it makes any  sense in the real world and, frankly, the prose is half-hearted at best and  the characters are un-characterized and the deadpan and entirely  unsurprising nature of the whole book bores you to death from start to  finish.<br />&quot;Stephen Bury&quot; (a.k.a. Neal Stephenson et al) wrote a  nice little book called Interface, which is a much better bet if you're  looking for a goofy fiction on things presidential.  Or if you're into the  far-out conspiracy angle, there's Robert Anton Wilson.  Heck, I can't even  begin to enumerate the better efforts.<br />What the heck went wrong  here?<br />Oh, well.  I'll just have to hope for a return to form in Grisham's  next book.	2000-06-27

He explains acronyms, he discusses strategy and military politics, and all in all does an exceptional job of  writing a layman's introduction to the art of making war.<br />So, Winston  Churchill it's not.  But, on the other hand, Every Man a Tiger comes across  as a book with much less of an axe to grind than About Face (which I  nonetheless highly recommend).  Is it a bit self-serving to Horner?  Yes,  but less so than the vast majority of other books written by or with the  aid of retired generals.<br />Most recommended to anyone wanting to learn more  about the higher level workings of the modern military.  Other readers will  find this book interesting as a quasi-biography of Horner and as a  relatively even-handed narrative of the Gulf War.	2000-06-24

He needs informants, he summons faeries.  And so  on.<br />Restrained and well written.  A fine effort for a first novel.  Could  have been far cornier than it turns out to be.  I'd expect Butcher's books  to evolve into more complex works in the future.<br />If you enjoy this novel,  you might want to get your hands on the &quot;H Philip Lovecraft&quot;  movies that ran on HBO.

The first book is about the journey, travelling on Mars, exploring, technology, and the like.  The political struggles and interpersonal  intrigue have started but this book doesn't rest on them.  I wouldn't say  that Red Mars is a &quot;page turner&quot; but at least it isn't a  &quot;page flipper&quot; like (to me at least) the next two.<br />Red Mars  starts out being a hard SF tech novel but by the time it's done it has  mutated into a mostly political work that could just as easily be written  about (somewhat incestuous) neighbors wrangling for control of your own  subdivision's community association.  That trend continues in the later  books, where the technology becomes a sort of background murmur and most of  the text is devoted to longwinded and somewhat distant arguments.<br />Enjoy  Red Mars for the not terribly intimate and moderately bloated saga of  planetary exploration and development that it is.  But don't expect as much  from the later books.  They're suitable for  stuck-on-an-airplane-with-six-hours-to-kill reading but not all that  exciting otherwise.	2000-06-06

This excellent foray into fantasy by John Barnes isn't as much sword-and-sorcery as it is a novel length Grimm's fairytale.  It certainly isn't a Disney fairytale.  Comparison to Goldman's The Princess Bride is  appropriate.  The writing always has a whimsical tone, but both good and  bad things happen with regularity.  <br />Barnes's ability to change his tone  and style completely from book to book always amazes me.  (I'm still not  convinced &quot;John Barnes&quot; is a single human being.)  If you like  your fantasy cockeyed yet lyrical, this is a book for you.	2000-06-03

It's a very Heinleinesque SF novel  about a spacebound culture told from the first-person perspective of a  thirteen year old girl. It's also a coming-of-age story, but ... with a  twist.  It's a sort of an-entire-spaceship-coming-of-age story.  If there's  one pattern that Orbital Resonance begins to establish, it's Barnes's  interest in cultural change and evolution and the planning thereof.  (Sounds like Heinlein again, doesn't it?)<br />A well-written book that needs  that &quot;almost a short story&quot; feel, Orbital Resonance is a good  introduction to John Barnes.  It won't give you much of a feel for what his  longer books are like, but then again, they don't resemble one another all  that much either.	2000-06-03

The protagonist Giraut is a young epee-wielding &quot;jovent&quot; from Nou Occitan.  Jovent culture  apparently lies somewhere between that of 18th century aristocracy and that  of Alex and his droog buddies in A Clockwork Orange.  <br />Dissatisfied and  dishonored, Giraut leaves his world through a &quot;springer&quot; (an  instant teleportation device) to become an Ambassador for the Thousand  Cultures.  The world on which he lands contains two polar cultures:  Caledon, where money becomes a holy arbiter of value, and austere St.  Michael.  Both cultures are deeply religious and theocratic although  opposite in just about every other respect.<br />When the springers come for  the first time to each of the Thousand Worlds, a &quot;Connect  depression&quot; ensues.  Giraut and the other ambassadors are there to  help Caledon and St. Michael re-enter interstellar human culture ... but it  turns out to be a challenge.<br />A Million Open Doors doesn't have a  well-defined linear plot, per se.  At the least, it is a coming-of-age  story for Giraut, who grows out of his jovent ways as the story progresses.   If you like atmospheric science fiction with interesting scenery and  well-developed characters, you should find this book to your liking.	2000-06-03

The (first-person) narrator speaks in stilted, self-centered prose  like, perhaps, a character from a R.A. Lafferty novel.  It becomes  apparent, after a while, that he inhabits a world that seems to have a  changing past.  Not only that but this changing past seems to be different  for everyone.  And then there is the matter of the United States having  gone missing.<br />It's an interesting premise until it turns into a road  trip.  Then the story begins leaking steam.  One of the characters turns  out to be a red herring.  (Or something very much like a red herring.)   People you've just begun to know turn out to be expendable or not around  for all that long for other reasons.<br />The mess is polished off with a  couple of dream sequences that might have been adapted from the rendezvous  of Picard and Kirk (well, not really, but ...).  Quirks of physics and  mathematics explain everything away.<br />Overall, underwhelming.  Not a bad  book to be stuck on an airplane with (which is where I read most of it) but  there's better reading to be had.  Much of it, in fact, with Barnes's own  name on it!	2000-05-31

Somewhere between Hunter S. Thompson and Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser in tone, it reads less like  fiction and more like a thinly fictionalized (but broadly embellished)  autobiography.<br />Told in the first-person voice of one hardy,  happy-go-lucky George Fergusson, Escape from Kathmandu drags you through  jungles, through the offices of local bureaucrats (much more challenging  than jungles), OVER a certain notable mountain, and into encounters with a  range of mystical beings, both human and sort of human.<br />It's a definite  eye-opener for Robinson fans (who may not even recognize it as the work of  the man who wrote the &quot;Colored Mars&quot; trilogy), and a must for  fans of dryly told stories that fall on the border between adventure and  fantasy.  Don't expect the pretense and angst that usually comes with a  Robinson novel--he gave them a miss on this one.	2000-05-31
US	52434944	R1DXWE3TR2L1E7	1565921496	291037037	Programming Perl	Books	3	34	39	N	N	A &quot;don't have to&quot; read	The official reference for the Perl language did not improve in its second generation.  The original &quot;purple Camel&quot; is, in my opinion, a true classic where books about programming and programming languages are  concerned--I rank it right there with The C Programming Language, Anatomy  of Lisp, Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs, and so forth.  It was a  classic because it was filled with lucid expressions of the thoughts of  Perl's quintessentially pragmatic creator, Larry Wall.  It was a classic  because it provided a literate and thoroughly reasoned counterpoint to  arguments in favor of more formally based languages and programming  styles.<br />But ... somewhere in the extensive revisions, additions,  extensions, and deletions that transformed the first Camel book into this,  the second Camel book, the magic went away.  And some very suspicious stuff  went in.  The book lost its digressive, essayic feel and became more of a  perfunctory reference work.  Additionally, some of the completely new  material turned out to be just a little ... strange.  The discussion of  object-oriented programming based around the term &quot;thingy&quot; just  doesn't do it for me.  (Ignore all that and read Damian Conway's book  instead.)<br />Preferences of style and tone aside, an unavoidable flaw of an  infrequently-updated book like this one is that it inevitably refers to an  obsolescent version of Perl.  If you want current Perl documentation, you  need to read the man(ual) pages that came with that version of Perl.   What's in this book is generally but not completely accurate for newer  versions of Perl.  And because it's intended to be a more or less complete  reference covering even small details, it can't help but be dead wrong on  some points as the language continues to evolve.  Bear in mind, also, that  much of the material in this book comes STRAIGHT from the man pages.  (Just  not the up-to-date versions.)<br />A third edition is in the works, which will  no doubt be at least a temporary improvement.  If the newer version  restores the insight and charm of the original, it will certainly deserve a  place on your programming bookshelf.  But as a reference work intended to  cover a constantly-evolving language, Programming Perl will always suffer  by being out of date.<br />If you are the type who dislikes reading electronic  documentation, by all means, buy a copy of this book.  But you'll find that  you have to use the online documentation anyway.	2000-05-30

Neil is Mr. Word Choice.  Mr. Clever Word Choice.  Mr. This Word Will Make  You Laugh at an Otherwise Inappropriate Time Choice.  But ONE THOUSAND  pages of Sardonic Word Choices?  That should get old.  Other writers tread  the edge between sardonic and cynical.  Stephen King does it but he bails  out into the horrible.  Tom Clancy does it (increasingly competently) but  he bails out into the gory.  Stephenson begins by righting himself on the  knife-edge of his wit and starts off at a faster than normal walking tempo  toward his destination.  Then after a while is making headlong dashes right  down that same gleaming divider as if he didn't know it was supposed to  slice him in half with a somewhat silly result.  But he keeps going and  you're both reading the story and waiting for the literary wreck, which  never comes.<br />Aside from the hours you'll spend discovering that you don't  need William F. Buckley's vocabulary to delight yourself with words,  another pleasant aspect of Stephenson's books is that any character whose  company you share for more than a pair of paragraphs turns out to be  intelligent.  You know those subplotted suspense potboilers where you're  forced to spend every fifth chapter with some very determined person  motivated by extreme and permanent hatred, but possessing the subtlety and  mental skill of a tractor tire?  Wrong book.  Not found  here.<br />Cryptonomicon isn't science fiction, per se; it's a suspense novel  set in a more or less Earth-normal setting, although a few proper names get  changed for apparently whimsical reasons (Linux becomes  Finux--&quot;Finland&quot;, get it?).  It could form the basis of  additional works set in the near future, of course.<br />I'm delighted to see  an accomplished word-mangler like Stephenson enjoy success.  He's  exceedingly good at what he does, but don't think he's unique!  If you  enjoy his style you should check out some other authors with exceptional  prose skills and a wry sense of humor: R. A. Lafferty, Robert Anton Wilson  (I recommend the Schrodinger's Cat Trilogy), Fritz Leiber (Fafhrd and the  Grey Mouser stories), early Fred Pohl, and of course Kurt Vonnegut.	2000-05-30

It illustrates how to construct all manner of  object-oriented frameworks in Perl and aptly demonstrates the wide range of  styles that are possible--from simplistic to complex and constrained.<br />My  only complaint about this work, which is more of an opinion that isn't  relative to its rating, is that I think Perl programs are more beautiful  and elegant when they don't embody complex scaffolding of the type that  this book so ably describes.  I see this book as a Perl counterpart to  Coplien's Advanced C++, but in the case of C++, it's possible to bury  scaffolding in a library out of sight in a way that isn't quite possible in  Perl.  I'm not sure how many Perl programmers actually know C++ (my  experience is that it's a surprisingly small number) but I think that C++  is a language that tolerates and even demands such complexity in a way that  Perl doesn't.<br />One thing for sure--the coverage of objects here is vastly  superior to that in the turquoise Camel book (Programming Perl).  I'm  sorry, but I think the topic deserves more descriptive terminology than  &quot;thingy.&quot;  Conway knows his concepts, knows how to execute them  in Perl, and sets them down lucidly and, yes, exhaustively.<br />I'm not sure  it's worth it in the long run, but that's just me, and obviously others see  architectural tradeoffs differently.  Meanwhile, this is an excellent,  literate work that enhances both the capabilities of programmers and the  stature of Perl.  If nothing else, studying it will definitely improve your  understanding of the language and idioms of Perl.  But I would expect it to  be more rewarding than that.	2000-05-26

I say somewhat peculiar, because I'm never sure whether they are truthful or tall tales.  Probably somewhere in between.  But what does  it matter whether they're literally true or not--it's not as if I have some  kind of personal reference what life on the PGA TOUR is like.<br />McCord has  been funnier and is funnier when he's speaking.  This book has a weird,  atmospheric style.  More deadpan than you'd expect.  It's as if he's  speaking parables to you and you're never quite sure which parts are  supposed to be funny.  There's something else about the style ... as if he  is trying to stay one notion ahead of the reader, which he accomplishes by  leaving out a thought or two from time to time.  I can't say it's bad, but  it's not what one would expect.<br />I'd rate this 3-1/2 stars but I'm stuck  with whole numbers.  It's definitely better than average ... but not great.  If you want side-splitting, colorful tales, you'll want to check out Peter  Dobereiner's work.  This book provides a stranger, more meditative  experience.	2000-05-26

It teaches all the fundamentals and backs them up with Pelz's research.<br />One of the  most useful parts of the book is the putting games that it describes.  The  most useful of them, &quot;Safety Drawback,&quot; teaches you to hit the  ball into a &quot;cone&quot; past the hole.<br />Reading this book alone won't  make you a better putter, of course.  That'll take about 10,000 more  practice putts.  :)  But at least you'll know what to practice.<br />I can't  find any major faults with this book.  Pelz suggests a particular technique  but he also accepts that many other strokes and techniques work well.   Whether you're a beginner who is still trying to figure out what a decent  putting stroke looks like, or an experienced player who is just trying to  work out the kinks in his game, you'll find at least something in this book  to help you.

In other words, it's not really an instructional book.   Nicklaus gives advice but it's always in the context of how he plays the  game.<br />That said, Golf My Way is a wonderful introduction to the game of  golf, suitable for players of any level past complete beginner.  It is  especially suited for players looking for more insight into how to think  their way around a golf course.<br />The book is beautifully illustrated.  I  do, however, carry a slight bias in my opinion.  The book is illustrated by  Jim McQueen, who illustrated for Nicklaus for decades (and continues to do  so). McQueen's youngest son was a classmate of mine during the years that  they lived in western North Carolina.

Pelz's tome on the short game (strokes from 100 yards and in, excluding putting in this case) is thick, thorough, well written, and well illustrated.  But ... it lacks something that his earlier book, Putt Like  the Pros, had.<br />Perhaps it's that The Short Game Bible isn't a very dense  book.  True, it covers full shots, finesse shots, chipping, bunker play,  and other topics, but it seems to take too many pages and too many words.  Corey Pavin's shotmaking book lacks the quantitative backbone of this book,  but on the other hand, it covers significantly more territory in  significantly fewer pages.<br />Another issue is that I suspect not too many  players are really going to adopt Pelz's 4 wedge system.  On its face it's  impractical for a number of reasons--lack of practice facilities for  &quot;calibrating&quot; ones swing among the foremost of those  reasons.<br />But ... these aren't major problems.  Pelz's basic advice is  totally sound.  Furthermore, his emphasis on practicing and mastering shots  inside 100 yards is right on.  Following even a portion of his advice will  improve any golfer's game.<br />Highly recommended, even though I think the  book is a bit too well padded at times.	2000-05-26

(Or for all I know, all of its time out of print nowadays.)  The trilogy is one of Harrison's best &quot;machinegun typewriter&quot; books by far. The  opening premise of the first novel is that &quot;Deathworld&quot; is a  jungle planet teeming with life that evolves with a speed and ferocity  unlike any other planet in the universe.  To survive for even a moment on  the surface you must be superbly trained and superbly armed and prepared to  kill hordes of clever and supremely deadly predators.  And then you need to  figure out how to get work done in the meanwhile!<br />And obviously, people  with the skills needed to survive on Deathworld might find work elsewhere  ... in sequels perhaps.<br />A slightly different flavor than the Stainless  Steel Rat but nonetheless terrific non-stop action. Grab the next copy you  see.	2000-05-26

Donegan is both self-deprecating and facetiously self-centered in his  narrative and the resulting reading is frequently hilarious.<br />This book is  an excellent counterpoint to Feinstein's books about the PGA Tour, and in  some respects paints a more endearing picture of the European Tour by  pointing out its (not really, but almost) &quot;minor-league&quot;  aspects.<br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good golf story.

Although I haven't seen every book on the subject (I've only got 30 or 40 golf books) it is the best of  the ones I'm familiar with.<br />It covers pretty much every facet of  shotmaking--off the tee, iron play, wedges, and the short game. Pavin shows  you how to hit from all sorts of lies and suggests which shots are most  appropriate for a variety of conditions.<br />There's a ton of stuff to ponder  and work on in here.  Were you to take everything from the book and work on  it at the range one item at a time, you'd be beating balls for a couple of  years.  Which makes the book a pretty good value, I guess.  Not bad for  around 250 pages.	2000-05-26

But after the LOOOONG wait I finally found The Naked God sitting on the bookstore shelves waiting for me.  (I can't buy  *all* of my books online!)  And it wasn't a bad read.  In fact it was a  pretty good read.<br />It even inspired me to go back and re-read the first  volume of the trilogy, which is in fact well written.  Space opera, as the  liner suggests, it is.<br />But ... I have a couple of &quot;issues&quot; with  this epic. First of all, it was, and remains, bloatware of the highest  order.  The middle volume really didn't get much done.  It's a  characteristic of good space opera that virtually every chapter gets  something done!  In fact, if you're reading John Campbell, there might be a  new principle of physics discovered on every page!  So in this respect, the  work as a whole falls flat.<br />The other problem is the ending.  What's the  deal?  Hamilton got tired of writing?  Now, maybe &quot;the journey's worth  the price&quot; but I wanted to at least catch a glimpse of something  clever at the end, and instead I got bludgeoned with an immensely crude  finale a la deus ex machina.  (Was that a polyglot or what?)<br />Hamilton's  writing is decent going on excellent and his characters are engaging and  sometimes more, but ... I'm glad this is over.  And if I get a chance I'm  going to break his ankles and lock him up in a room with a typewriter and  request a proper ending.<br />Just kidding about that.  Really.	2000-05-25

Friedl applies his perfectionist and completist nature fully to the task.  He did  his own layout, which is not that unusual in the technical publishing  trade, but which definitely isn't the O'Reilly way.  The book is better for  it (probably much better) and for all the other places where his attention  to detail and thoroughness takes command.<br />This book is not a good end to  end read, but it goes very well if you read some of the beginning material  and then read a page or three from time to time as you get a chance.  I  sometimes (only half jokingly) suggest to my students that they should  replace their copy of Reader's Digest near their &quot;thrones&quot; with a  copy of MRE.  Then they can read about a new topic for 10 or 15 minutes and  ponder it for the rest of the day, which, if you are new to the theory and  reality of regular expressions, is about the perfect regimen.	2000-05-25

That's the case with The Practice Effect.  While I've generally found Brin a bit tedious (overlong,  overplotted, overwordy), I loved The Practice Effect the first time I read  it and enjoyed it at least as much when rereading it years later.  It reads  like Harry Harrison's best, or (most aptly) like The Flying Sorcerors.  The  hero is a technologically adept person, thrown into a less technological  environment, who learns to combine his modern-day savvy with the  peculiarities of his new environs to his considerable advantage.  And, of  course, to the delight of his readers.<br />The gimmick in &quot;The Practice  Effect&quot; is too entertaining to give up in a review, but you'll enjoy  every minute of seeing it exploited.  It's a short book (I wouldn't mind  more of these, actually) but one you'll want to read and re-read every word  of.	2000-05-25

It is  nonetheless an essential component of the well informed digital audio  engineer's library.

I first learned about the author and his book when I downloaded a computerized periodic table for the Macintosh written by John Cramer.  (It was a Hypercard stack, I believe.)   It was freeware that, incidentally, advertised his book Twistor.  I put the  book on my mental &quot;to buy&quot; list but it was YEARS before I spotted  a copy on a bookshelf.  (Still a first printing.  Go figure.)<br />What goes  around comes around, though, and I did wind up &quot;paying&quot; for  Cramer's excellent periodic table with my purchase of his book.  Meanwhile  it's a fine book, a thoroughly well crafted hard science fiction tale with  a little mystery and fantasy thrown in.  Highly recommended to fans of  &quot;good old SF&quot; -- like me!  And infinitely more deft than, say,  Crichton's recent expedition into vaguely similar territory.	2000-05-25

You should get Search for the Perfect Swing first. But  once you have that out of the way, this book is an excellent addition to a  golf library.<br />The biggest shortcomings of The Physics of Golf are (1) a  lack of quality illustrations/pictures/graphics and (2) a rather terse  treatment of the material. I feel that the author probably has enough  research to go on for 4-500 pages but called it quits at a much more  concise size. I'm all for concise, but not when it leaves me feeling some  useful material was left out.	2000-05-25

But try not to pay too much attention to the actual words of the author(s).  Some of them are laughable.  I'll keep this brief, so here's just one  excerpt:<br />&quot;ORACLE8 does not presently support an OO concept called  polymorphism.  Polymorphism is the ability of the same instruction to be  interpreted different ways by different objects.  For example, assume that  the instruction is 'fire'. The 'fire' instruction, as applied to the  'employee' object, would be interpreted in one manner; the same  instruction, as applied to the 'gun' object, would be interpreted in a  totally different manner.&quot;<br />Apparently the author doesn't know the  difference between polymorphism and a pun.  He certainly doesn't have any  understanding of what polymorphism really means.  His defense of ORACLE SQL  extensions is even sillier, and his presentation of normalization is  oblique and confused (and fortunately, because he apparently doesn't really  understand it, he only wastes a couple of pages on the topic), but as I  said, I'll keep this brief.  What's bad about this is that the author is  filling fresh new minds with misinformation.  But that's hardly a rarity in  technical publishing nowadays.<br />Decent books on DBMS are rare.  This isn't  a decent book, but it is a decent reference for ORACLE8, and probably  better than many other &quot;big thick book&quot; alternatives.  Caveat  emptor.	2000-03-06

On the one hand, it is a pretty good book, especially by 1990s SF standards.  On the other hand, it was the first big, thick, mainstream, third-person, subplotted SF  novel to really make an impact in the market.  So to speak.  (The Mote in  God's Eye was more of a conventional SF novel.)  With this book, Niven and  Pournelle single-handedly (or would that be &quot;four-handedly&quot;)   fused the suspense and SF genres and, well, kind of made SF what it is  today.  Which, in my opinion, is less than what it was 20 years ago.	1999-05-17

Of course nowadays Piers Anthony is known as the mundane and amazingly prolific author of Xanth books, and someone who  &quot;knows&quot; Piers Anthony would no more recognize his writing in  Macroscope than in, oh, &quot;In the Barn.&quot; Be that as it may, Anthony  was once a magnificent hard SF writer in the vein of Heinlein, and his  early works in the genre are good and sometimes great. Fantasy owes Anthony  a huge debt for popularizing the genre, but if you ask me, he did his heavy  lifting in SF.	1999-05-17

Slan of course, Macroscope, and several Heinlein books, but  the one that came out on top was Emergence.  It appeared in shorter form in  Analog magazine (if memory serves); I was told about it by a friend and  wound up reading it on microfilm. Later I snatched the book from the  bookstore shelves, and somewhat after that read the sequel Threshold.  It  is an honest and compelling book written with an incredibly clear, lucid  viewpoint.  Although I realize that everyone has felt alienated at one  point or another, it is also enormously powerful to those of us who have  felt alienated by our gifts or talents in childhood.	1999-05-17

Hardly any of his work was in print.  I owned no Lovecraft books except for an extremely worn copy of The Colour out of Space.  I read what I could in libraries,  but his work had fallen so far off the horizon that it was hard just  finding a bibliography.  At some point in the late 1970s I heard of  &quot;Dream Quest&quot; and discovered that it was so rare as to be  virtually nonexistent.  I finally managed to read a copy in 1981 or 1982 in  the stacks of the Duke University library (it was a reserve book, of  course).  My anecdote aside, this is an very good tale that shouldn't have  been so hard to find, and now that virtually all Lovecraft is back in  print, you should buy (and hoard) a copy for yourself if you have any  interest in Lovecraft in longer form.	1999-05-17

Who needs 3600 pages to tell the  story of &quot;Intergalactic Night of the Living Dead?&quot;  This is even  more annoying because Hamilton is a pretty good writer and he is wasting  his time and his words on this decent but extremely thinly plotted epic of  space opera.  Chtorr, by way of comparison, *needs* thousands of pages, but  this silly adventure could have been completed in a single volume.  Its  punch line is not going to improve with age, nor as a result of this  story's incredible bulk.  I'd rather be reading more Quantum Murders, thank  you very much.	1999-05-17

This is one of the most memorable novels I've consumed in the  1990s, and probably the first (I read Snow Crash later :) that made me go  &quot;hmm.&quot;  It turned me into a voracious and loyal consumer of John  Barnes prose, and I haven't regretted it. But Barnes is a tricky fellow to  pin down. He writes in several different styles; heck, he might be several  different people.

Obviously it wasn't a technothriller in my  usual vein, but on the other hand I've also been known to read and enjoy a  Grisham novel or two.<br />Anyway, I bought the book, and my  &quot;verdict&quot; is that it is a good read and that it showcases a  writer with a lot of talent.  MacGregor indulges in cliches, of course, but  he doesn't prop his story up on them.  Nor does he prop it up on science or  an industry that he doesn't understand.  I'm not saying he doesn't  understand the &quot;techno&quot;, just that he shies away from  technobabble that might belie an understanding, if you know what I  mean.<br />What I liked about this book, somewhat surprisingly, was  MacGregor's very careful drawing of his protagonist, the litigator Lang, a  man with loyalties, morality, responsibilities, and decency. Although some  scenes are viewed through other characters' eyes, the book is essentially a  third-person narrative told from Lang's viewpoint, and he turns out to be a  character with whom it is not only easy but pleasant to identify.  This is  unusual in this age of monotonous eight hundred page omniscient--and  uniformly ambiguously moral--&quot;thrillers.&quot;<br />The thing I found  most lacking, or perhaps that I most wanted to find, was the sharp sense of  humor and irony that John Grisham and even, nowadays, Tom Clancy inject  into their works.  I wanted a twist or two toward the end, a surprise or an  O'Henry hook, but it never materialized.  Realistic perhaps, but I have the  History Channel for that.	1998-10-04

The  only drawback of the book, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is  that I think the typography is lousy.  In particular, the font for the code  samples is too light, and the excessive leading in general makes the book  harder to read.  The book has its share of first printing typos, but then  again, mine had them too, so I can hardly complain about that.  :-)  Good  work, Lincoln!	1998-09-30

I've got a whole bookshelf of algorithms books, and this is by far the best book on file organization in my collection. Tharp was one of the best professors I ever had, and it was a pleasure to work from his excellent (and unfortunately hard to find) book. If I had to own a single book on this topic, well, here it is.	1998-01-15
