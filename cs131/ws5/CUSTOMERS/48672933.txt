There are chapters dealing with the symbolism of colors, materials, actions, gestures, numbers, hieroglyphs, forms, size and location.

In this thin booklet reprinted by Dover you will find a fine and most pleasant reading on the history of the most reknown and famed names that built up the literature of Horror, by the hand of the celebrated and controversial master of Cosmic or Materialist Terror, Howard Phillips Lovecraft, to whom some regard as the successor of Edgar A. Poe in North American horror-tales tradition. This short essay of his is one of his most commendable titles, even recommended by many of those who consider him a &quot;second-rate&quot; author. This booklet will make you to think otherwise. If you are interested in  learning easily and pleasantly about this kind of literature-genre, do not doubt it, buy this one right now.	2001-12-28

Those who claim that the collection of &quot;translated&quot; spells at the end of the book  &quot;actually work on&quot;, are either fancy-minded people or, sorry to say it, must look for psychological assistance. How can anybody believe that an &quot;ancient Egyptian&quot; spell could work &quot;translated into English&quot;, when it was the proper intonation of the &quot;ancient Egyptian&quot; spoken language, what made the &quot;thing&quot; to work on? Just stop speaking non-sense. This book is written by a well-known scholar and is a scholarly book from start to end. None the less, it is not all the good one that it should be. It has well-worked chapters, such as those on Hieroglyphs and Amulets, and the one on the Objets from the tomb of Tutankhamun, but otherwise, there is not much new-oriented research: it aims to the general public, and in this sense,it fulfills its aims.

The &quot;editio princeps&quot; goes back to 1888 and was the result of gathering together the field-notes taken by him during his study-tours around the great cemeteries of Memphis, especially at Saqqara. The records taken from many tombs, since then damaged, deteriorated or lost and never refound again, make of this work an indespensable source of information for anyone interested in the archeology and history of one of the most glorious periods of Pharaonic Egypt,i.e., the Old Kingdom. Edited as manuscript notes and sketches, it also stands as an example of how the earliest researches undertook their job, not always in the better recording conditions. It is only strongly desired that one printer would undertake the (hardly looking as a quite profitable) task of reprinting this title, even if only for the sake of keeping alive a memorial for the illustrious French archaeologist. But I'm sure it would also be a good bussiness in the end: such a &quot;classical&quot; book surely will atract the attention of many buyers: I include myself.	2000-11-17

None the less, the first part of the book will be useful also to historians of religion, since in it, Dr. Baines attempted to define - through a series of actual cases - the problematic of religious iconography and classification of iconographical major themes; his comments upon the methodological problems when dealing with such an issue go beyond the field of Egyptology properly speaking, and this adds a greater value to his job. Part two focuses in the analyses of what up to-day has been loosely called &quot;Nile Gods&quot; in the &quot;decorative grammar&quot; of Egyptian Art and Architecture, who, after him, must be better named  &quot;Fecundity Figures&quot;. Since these fat genii are intimely intertwined with the heraldic motif of the &quot;Uniting of the Two Lands&quot; - a royal theme -, this is also reviewed on. For those interested in the coloring as used in Egyptian art and writing, there is an appendix on the matter, along with illustrations, tables and indexes. A great job from a great scholar.

This novel, which appeared as a series in the famous Al-Ahram cairote newspaper between August and December, 1959, can be defined as that marking the passage of the author from his &quot;realistic&quot; to his &quot;symbolist&quot; period. The contents describes in an allegorical way the History of Mankind, and, in a more profound level, the evolution of human belief in God upto the human disbelief in Him thanks to Science (which is presented as a completely amoral belief). This writing is unique in several ways: introduces allegory in Arab modern novel, while at the same time, it shows us the  &quot;anatomy&quot; of Mahfouz's universe, which re-appears in many of his following works. The text is srong and subtle simultaneously, and this exerts a great appeal on the reader's mind. A last word: the most you know about History, the most you enjoy the tale!

There are excellent  editions and translations of all of the aforesaid &quot;Egyptian  books&quot;, but very few in which the connection between the three of them  can be traced so neatly as in this one.

I don't wont to be qualified as an &quot;extremist fan&quot; of Mahfouz,  but I repeat myself: this is one of the most interesting and human book I  ever read. The style chosen by Mahfouz is absolutely fascinating: a series  of most appealing or repulsing people - both men and women - pass before  our very eyes led by the voice of an anonimous character. Of course, one  firstly suppose that the latter is none other than Mahfouz himself and that  the other people are actual persons whom he met along his life, since the  narrative is presented as flowing evocative occurrences, some having a sort  of continuation along the play, others not. Some critics have denied that  this work should be defined as a  &quot;novel&quot;, but an attentive  reading and evaluation certainly dispels such a pretension. It is not only  a  &quot;novel&quot;, but an extraordinary one, through which one can get  closer to the mind, ways and heart of the Egyptian modern people. The  Arabic original was published in 1972 and this was Mahfouz's first work  after the &quot;disaster&quot; of 1967. Therefore, even the title is  evocative of the psychological conditions of the Egyptian society at the  time: like a mirror reflecting a succession of images, as a lot of  fragments after a shock. The life of all those around the teller is simply  sketched out, but one becomes familiar with each one of them, perhaps  because, as it is usual in Mahfouz, he has touched upon the chords of the  human heart.	2000-09-13

Isa is an  &quot;historical outsider&quot;, he lives out of his times, and all this  leads him to an actual &quot;psychological eclipse&quot;.The span of time  covered by the novel is lengther than in other writings of his, from the  same years: occurrences happen in a longer period, happenings become in a  slower pace. Isa's past is told through flashbacks and mind-flowing  thoughts. What is a surprise is the end: the abrupt conclusion has left  many critics hanging on; I think that this book deals with the  &quot;autumn&quot; of a man, but that Life always give a chance to  &quot;find oneself again&quot;, such as the &quot;grocer&quot; return once  and again to the same place after it has migrated God knows where. A nice  and human-touching book.	2000-09-13
US	48672933	R2HR7K3ZU80VPG	0521272343	264764270	A Short History of Modern Egypt	Books	2	6	13	N	N	CONCISE AND NOTHING ELSE	This book is more of a historical guide to the modern history of Egypt  than a  &quot;history&quot; itself. The (selected) facts and persona are  taken in a chronological succession, being merely described but not  analysed in-depth. So that it is only helpful as a resource for checking  dates and names, but it is just disappointing as for the actual historical,  political and social forces that gave form to present-day Egypt, her  position in contemporary world and her most accute problems (among which  the &quot;identity&quot;-problem: Muslim or Western Egypt?).	2000-09-09

I read it from start-to-end in a run, so  involving is the matter it researches as the way in which it is written. An  authoritative essay and a source of information on one of the most shocking  issues of the last (and present) century, focused on one of the less known  areas about religious terrorism. The translation from the French edition is  accurate and confiable. A title you can not miss if you are engaged in  studying the subject or merely in knowing more about it. Highly  recommended!	2000-09-07

Boredom and insatisfaction is all he  got from his surroundings, work, family. The search for &quot;feeling  alive&quot; became an interior struggle which ends with the birth of a   &quot;beggar&quot;. The climax of the story is admirably led by Mahfouz,  who, once more, had gifted us with a very human and touching tale. I  recommend this title as one that no one can miss, especially if one is a  fan of Nobel Prize's Mahfouz. I give it 4 stars only, because I have read  better books of his from the same period, but this do not diminishes the  value of this one.	2000-08-28

It mainly covers the Egyptian concepts about the Afterlife, so that it  deals mainly with the mythological characters and customs of the mortuary  realm. Although very speculative in several discussions, it still contains  useful hints here and there, and its reading is a good source of ideas,  whether for idle speculation or for researching forgotten aspects of  ancient Egyptian religion. As always, if you are a beginner, in spite of  being a book addressed to the general public you must be extremely cautious  and check each and every quotation with other more reliable sources.	2000-08-26

For those looking for a clear and up-dated overview of ancient Egyptian  religion, THIS IS NOT THEIR BOOK. As it happens with many of Budge's books,  this two-volumes set is quite out-dated and, moreover, it is  highly-speculative (but without warning one that what he says is just that:  speculation). Non the less, for those with a rather deep acquaintaince of  the Egyptian Mythology and beliefs, it still could be helpful in certain  matters. And, as it always occurs with Budge's works, there are scattered  here and there some bits of useful data. Another criticism, which can be  extended over to any of his other titles, is the lack or meagre references  to the bibliography or documents from which he extracted his quotations. So  that, BEGINNERS BEWARE!	2000-08-25

Readers of Budge know him very well, so that warnings against his  sometimes carelesness in transcribing the hieroglyphs and the old ways of  transliterating them are unnecessary. Pay attention to the meanings of the  terms: most of them are in bad need of a revision, but if the reader has  more actual dictionaries (such as Faulkner's or Lesko's) there is no way to  be mistaken. A great but rather out-of-date work, which must be used  carefully by the beginners. For those engaged in ancient Egyptian  hieroglyphs, a must and a doorway to understand better one of the most  ancient religious texts of Humankind.	2000-08-24
