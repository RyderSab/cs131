Okay...I consider myself a spiritual human being and I have been so enlightened by the Dalai Lama book 'The Art of Happiness' or Marlo Morgan's 'Mutant Message from Forever' or even \\"As It Is\\" (another great one by Tony Parsons); however, this one did NOT awaken me.  If anything I wanted to fall asleep many times.  It's a bunch of mish-mosh for some so-called person to think they're \\"enlightened\\" when (if you've read 'As It Is') one will realize that NO ONE can ever be \\"enlightened\\"--let alone \\"awakened\\".  So, if you want to 'Ask the Awakened' don't bother reading this book.  Instead, ask your ownself 'What is RIGHT for you'?  There were a few lines that managed to grasp my attention. For instance:<br /><br />\\"What we seek to describe by the word \\"love\\" is emotion experienced in certain highly personal channels, charged with possesiveness, shadowed by jealousy, with its counterpart \\"hate\\" ever ready to take its place.\\"<br /><br />OR<br /><br />\\"Words can never transfer understanding: they can only open the way for pre-existing knowledge to rise into consciousness.\\"<br /><br />OR<br /><br />\\"If the mind could be looked-at, it would then be an OBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE.\\"<br /><br />And so, I did take away something (but things I already knew--just not formulated in this manner).  I was just turned on when I saw that every reviewer before me gave this book 5 STARS.  Hello?  I just don't see why.  Read one of the three aforementioned books above and you'll definitely be \\"awakened\\".	2005-08-19

This is my first book reading experience by Maraget Atwood.  It is a personable memoir that opened my eyes to the value, importance and creativity of writing.  If anyone writes--in any way---they'll learn from this book.  I was especially astonished to read how most writers have a sort of \\"double identity\\".  It makes perfect sense in that a writer has to take on many forms, personalities and feelings in order to emote a character.  She also points out that 'an art of any kind is a discipline'.  I loved this book...and I feel like I'm a WIZARD (as in the Wizard of Oz).  You'll understand what I mean if you read this book.  I have to leave some element of suprise.  Trust me, you will be surprised.  A great book--for writers of any type. ;)	2005-08-05

His close call with cancer was extremely close and a heartwrenching, touching experience.  I certainly feel for him.  I used to be an avid cyclist, so I was quite interested in the book after a friend from Ireland (Paul Gourley) told me he loved the book.  It's worth reading for anyone dealing with cancer or who loves bicycling.  It's just not on my HIGH list as far as literary achievements go.  If there's one thing I learned it's that Lance loves to WIN--no matter what the race/game/fight.  Now I hear he's dating Sherly Crow, so I wonder what happened to 'the love of his life', the woman who had his child, Luke (wonders never cease as time goes by).	2005-07-19

When I asked her for a book recommendation she thought I'd like this for it's flashbacks into the Investment Banking business as it related to a young woman who inherited her father's wealth.  Not only did I LOVE the book but I got so much more out of it.  There were lines in the book that really made me step back and think.  For instance:<br /><br />'It's a funny thing about love:  you don't need to have it returned to love somebody.  Loving's enough.'<br /><br />or<br /><br />'You can be happy without money and you can be wretched with it.  It depends on what kind of person you are.'<br /><br />or<br /><br />'I'm not the scoundrel you think I am; if you had ever taken the time to learn about me you'd even have liked me.'<br /><br />or<br /><br />'If people are lucky enough to have family they should cultivate it.'<br /><br />or<br /><br />'We all choose how to look at life.'<br /><br />or<br /><br />'How can you keep resentment alive so long?'<br /><br />or<br /><br />'Really, half the troubel and misery and pain people have is brought on by themselves.  They either talk too much or not enough.'<br /><br />or<br /><br />'He had his preconceived frame of reference, and he thought everyone should fit into it.  Why does everyone believe his own particular reality is the only reality?'<br /><br />or<br /><br />'Every day is different, and in some way we change every day.'<br /><br />...need I say more?

I wouldn't even consider reading it if my very own daughter, Arianna, hadn't mentioned it so excitedly to her friend, Laura, last August 2004.  I finally found a used copy and I'm very glad I read it now.  Paulo Coelho simply adds so much to one's life in his profound words (and definitely read THE ALCHEMIST--if you haven't already!).  'No one should let themselves get used to anything'.  Hey that last sentence is in this book!  I'd highly recommend this book for any person who is psychologically 'in the know' and/or who has an inkling of minimal depression during the trials and tribulations of living a routine life.  Everyone has an unusual story to tell--is another line in this book and the Eduard character is clearly semi-autobiographical to Paulo's own life.  Another good reminder from this book is to make sure you get enough 'sunlight' in your life.  It DOES make a difference!	2005-02-24

I read them all and was sadly disappointed that they did not capture me as much as I'd hoped.  My favorite stories were CARRIED AWAY and A WILDERNESS STATION.  I really liked her clever usage of 'letter writing' as letters were intertwined into the stories.  I also found some great lines in her stories, but it wasn't one of those \\"I can't put this book down\\" books.  To use one of the phrases in her book she is 'a cut above the ordinary' and so I would recommend the book for those in the mood for short stories.  You'll take away a little something from the story called OPEN SECRETS, too.  I think amazon.com recommended this book for me.  It's probably because I read 'Interpreter of Maladies'--a much better collection of nine short stories by Jhumpa Lahiri.<br /><br />As Alice wrote in the short story, THE REAL LIFE: '...torn between pleasure and agony, hope and suspense.  The things that could go wrong multiplied'.  And that is how it was when I only found pleasure in three of her stories.	2005-02-07

I imagined the matriarch of the story as actress, Imelda Staunton (she was Academy Award nominated for the film VERA DRAKE in 2004).  The story moved along so quickly that the first chapter had the matriarch married as a young girl, the second chapter had her with two young daughters and the third chapter had one of the daughters impregnated by a schoolteacher during a school dance outing.  The chapters get more steamy as one reads along.  I must thank my dentist friend, Jane Carter, in Surrey, England who recommended the book.  I truly got a lot out of the book.  It's clearly true that 'a family is irrevocably changed with each additional child' as is mentioned in the book.	2005-01-30

She wrote about how we ALL take our parents wherever we go.  And she reminded me that Kinsey found that so many prefer sex in the afternoon (right after I saw the movie KINSEY, starring Liam Neeson).  She is very original in the way she tells a story.

She died on Jan 30, 2004.  I had this book on my 'need to read' shelf when I read an obituary in the NY Times about her death at age 79.  She endured so much and wrote so keenly.  She was thought to be a schizophrenic and wrote about her periods of madness in mental institutions.  This autobiography was fascinating for me. There is a gentleness and everlasting patience about her that will make anyone like her.  If you want a real treat...find the film AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE (from 1990) that Jane Campion (famous for the film THE PIANO) to complement the book.  If only I could have met this woman.

I read it while on a train going from Tokyo to Takayama, Japan.  The star of the book is a young boy who is immediately admired.  He is looked upon as a misfit, but in reality he is a genius.  He makes total sense.  It's everyone else that needs work.  What a wonderful story.  It also reminded me of one of my favorite high school books called FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON.	2005-01-09

It's meant to be read and re-read over various times in ones life.  It reminds one to stay the course and live life happily, going for what you really want out of life.  I really loved the way the author took a simple story into something that has truly been explained in so many complex ways.

It's sentimental and there are some worthwhile lines that you'll find 'in between'.  However, it's not classic literature by any means.

Tristine really offers some great ideas for formulating new spice to ones diary or journal.  It's so true that ideas can truly come from the stories we write in our diary.  The every day happenings...and thoughts...and emotions...and lists that we write down are key to our memoirs.<br />I'd HIGHLY recommend reading this one in combination with the reading of another novel.  It's quite INSPIRATIONAL!  Now...finding this book is another story.  With the amazon.com used books for sale vendors...you might get lucky.

There are some very significant lines in this book that I will certainly take away with me, too. For instance:<br />When the bird has flown, the essence of its song is often mislaid, and then all we are left with is an empty cage.<br />By letting go our fascination with the extraordinary and spectacular, we can allow ourselves to recognize the simple wonder that lies within the ordinary.<br />We are hardly ever at home.<br />When I look back at my life as openly as possible, I see how I have attracted to me the people, the events, and teh pattens that have been perfectly appropriate to the kinds of influences and images that my particular belief systems have been expressing.<br />And yes...there IS more because that's the way it &quot;is&quot;.	2004-04-02

This book was on a recommended list by Michael Cunningham (author of THE HOURS).  I certainly see what Cunningham saw in this exquisitely original piece that did win the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction.  I'm only giving it three stars because the subject matter (a murder and the aftermath description of the decaying bodies) is disturbing.  It made me think twice when the author wrote:<br />'Life is.  It goes.  It does not count.  That was the hurtling truth that comes to rattle everyone as they grow up, grow old.'<br />I almost resented that line--because in my view...Life does matter and does count...by giving, sharing and touching...we pass on wonderful things to future lives.

I can see how he liked the stance of a woman who is a champion swimmer and takes a dive into three different scenarios of how her life could have been.  I suppose it's up to the reader to decide which is the TRUE story (if one wants to go that route).  Alas, the book didn't flow as well as I would have liked.  There were some memorable lines though: &quot;I don't want you to think I'm after your secrets.  I'm not. I'm just looking for a way in.&quot;  I would have rather it been ONE FULL STORY with her psychological feelings all wrapped together.  I guess its just another author trying to be creative.  The writer wrote: THE NEXT MINUTE IS AN AQUAMARINE BLUR.  I find that amusing now because most of the book will ultimately be a blur.  I wouldn't strongly recommend this as it's easy to put down and NOT pick up again.  It took some strain for me to finish.  I like a book that I can't wait to read...try MEMOIRS OF HECATE COUNTY by Edmund Wilson instead--quite a literary find!	2003-10-10

It's not a long book (only 179 pages) but it wasn't what I expected.  I wanted a more intricate story with sub-plots and more controversy.  It's clear that Catholic convents had strict rules in the early 20th Century.  It took me into a loop when Mariette has a stigmatic experience that no one took seriously; whereby, she was dismissed from becoming a nun.  The story really lacked a good plot and there were too many SISTERS in the story.  One is better off finding the excellent film, THE MAGDALENE SISTERS (which is based on a true story).  The writing by author Ron Hansen cannot be overlooked as he does have a special style.  This was a National Bestseller in 1991.  I think a lot of readers were intriged and 'let down' by the title alone.  Oh well...it added a completely new subject as a follow-up to my last book (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN--Haha).	2003-08-12

I figured it was time to get on the \\"Hogwarts Train\\" again (so-to-speak).  It was just as wonderful as the last two books.  I was especially thrilled by Professor Dumbledore's advice to Harry Potter toward the end of the book:  \\"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us?  You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble?  Your father is alive in you...and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him.\\"  I LOVE IT.

He got us to know know and like the key characters in this book, Julien &amp; Austin.  The storyline lacked stories behind the stories.  It seemed a little too blanketed/general.  There was something missing.  I enjoyed it and did read it to the end, getting some worthwhile lines out of the writer.  The character who was dying of AIDS made me feel a bit depressed.  I haven't read a lot of books along these lines but I know there are a lot of them on this subject matter.  If any reader has already gone there (where a key character dies of AIDS) there's no point in re-visiting...just a warning.	2003-07-21

The title caught my eye.<br />Yes, it deals with grief after a most desirable family member passes away.  This Aunt Lupe has lived a most difficult life in Mexico City.  It's a cultural look at poverty and the things people must do to simply survive.  It was awakening as a reminder of how easily we forget.  If there was an earth-shattering event...most of us (EVEN YOU) could be in a similar predicament.  It's hard to fathom it possible but we are lucky to have what we do.  If any of you have lost a loved one...the book is helpful in dealing with grief as well.  Don't be turned off by the depressive title of the book as Oscar Lewis has contributed a fine piece of literature.  It is quite the classic.	2003-06-09

I remember being in Los Angeles and first hearing about the murder of Irene Silverman.  I started to follow the NY TIMES articles on the entire matter.  Then, I saw Kent Walker on Larry King and decided to get the book--which I finally managed to read & finish during a flight to London & France.  It was quite interesting to read this book from her eldest sons' eyes.  He was true to heart about his feelings.  It could NOT have been easy for him.  It's miraculous how he was fortunate enough to take the 'right' road in life (although I'm sure he had his fair share of mischievous stories that were never revealed).  The book really kept me interested.  It's really worthwhile reading for anyone who likes True Crime stories.  It's also so UNBELIEVABLE.  It is a relief to know that Sante Kimes is 'locked up' for good now.  She seemed to be a detriment to society at large.  She literally got away with murder.  It reminded me of Winona Ryder (on a smaller scale) as I read in the NY POST about how  shoplifters simply do what they do for the THRILL...TO SEE HOW EASILY THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH IT.  Once they get away with 'one' thing...they pattern continues--like alcoholism or any other disease.  I guess one could say that Sante Kimes did have a disease and she passed it on to her youngest son, Kenny.  It seems Sante Kimes did everything every day of her life for the thrill...simply to see if she could get away with it--and she actually did until it all caught up with her.  YIPES! What a creepy woman.  I wish I could meet Kent Walker and talk to him--I do feel for him and wish I could embrace him and let him know that it's all 'okay' (the feelings & emotions he has & will continue to live with).  Kent (if you are reading this)...you have a friend in me.	2003-05-27

I read William Corlett's other book (NOW AND THEN) which is a much better book (5 Stars).  This is just 'ok'.  I wouldn't run out &amp; recommend it very strongly.

My parents were born & raised in New Mexico, so I have a fascination with the Southwestern state.  I was hoping for a bit more in these stories though.  It was fun reading family names that I could relate via my own family (Garcia, Leyba, Lucero).  Abe Pena seems to be a talented writer but I found the excerpt story on the nun, Sister Lydia, most interesting (and wished there was more).  I would almost like to read a book simply focused on Sister Lydia's life, thoughts, feelings and emotions.  That would be fantastic!  A lot of the stories were simply 'informational' with a lot of boring statistical facts (dates & names) that bored me.  I simply needed more stories behind the stories.  There were a few interesting facts that I could relate to, knowing that my ancestry descended from Spain.  It was an okay book...but I hope the author will next time focus on one story, sharing more family secrets, troubles, etc as per the literary classic, A Death in the Sanchez Family (which I plan to read next).	2003-05-27

It was an interesting story that I think would make a wonderful film.  The whole idea of being wrongfully accused of being a British agent and arrested by the Russian KGB and sentenced to 25 years of hard labor is a painful thought.  However, this British character grows on you as you feel his pain and suffering while he works around it via friendships with inmates.  It's meaningful, but I wouldn't rave about it as a very BEST BOOK that one must read.  There is a line in the book that goes, &quot;So what wisdom have you learnt today?  Or has it yet to come?&quot;  Well, I liked the book but I still feel the wisdom I wanted to get has yet to come.  There were some remarkable lines that are worth remembering (that I will not deny).  More men would appreciate the book than women.  It's written by a man who is writing about a man's life.  In the end, the main character chooses a small village to remain close to the family he promised to keep a watchful eye over.  The writing style is unique.	2003-02-13

This book called MICHAEL wasn't a big HIT for me (I was hopeful since my name is Michael).  It's more like a short story about a middle-aged gay man who is trying to find meaning in his life as he is about to 'follow the Light' to his death and be reunited to those he loves in the Heavens.  There are some incidents that are brushed upon that clearly make him feel guilty about the way he (Stephen, the main character) lives his life.  It got into a Christian religious tangent mixed with some homoerotic parts that weren't really necessary.  Then, there's this whole 'end of the world' scenario with a nuclear bombing in Russia and planes disappearing & crashing in NY & elsewhere (a bit sinister since this was published in 2000--prior to 9-11-01).  It's almost like the author is writing a story for himself about how he hopes the circumstances will be when he dies.  When I think of this it makes it a bit more interesting.	2003-01-16

I saw it listed as required reading for a literature course that I was not able to take due to traveling schedules.  And so, I read it anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a definite inspiration for us all to write in our notebooks about our daily life.  Who knows what memories we will leave for future generations?  It's about a family and the events that happen over a few generations.  I really hate to give much more detail so that the reader can use his own wonderful imagination.  It is an EXCELLENT book.  I want to rent the DVD now (if Meryl Streep is playing Clara, the matriarch, it must be worth seeing) for a new perspective. A few of the many lines that struck me:<br />-All was served and presented with the utmost simplicity...because any display of extravagance was a sign of vulgarity...according to..ancestry of that society descended from hard-working Basque and Spanish immigrants.<br />-Hatred took a long time to explode.  It began with a concealed uneasiness and a desire to offend each other in small details.<br />-There is always a way to do what you want to do.<br />-The point was not to die, since death came anyway, but to survive, which would be a miracle.<br />-The saving idea of writing was to keep thoughts occupied and to escape...and live.	2003-01-15

I learned a lot &amp; reflected on a few customs that have been carried over in my family...for example, love of sardines &amp; pride in my Spanish heritage.  This was quite interesting to learn about the long history of the Basque people.  It's amazing to realize that it is quite likely that the Basque people may very well be the first known Europeans.<br />I strongly recommend this for any one visiting Northern Spain, any historian interested in Europe &amp;/or any one of Spanish ancestry.  I recently (Oct. 2002) visited Laredo, Spain, Zaragoza, Spain (The Armijo Palace) and Biarritz, France...I felt at home and safe in these areas.	2002-11-21

This is clearly the pressure of a reknowned author being pressured to come out with another book quickly.  It's like reading excerpts from his personal journal that have been thrown together.  It starts out adjectively (and continues that way) with one getting to know the feeling of Provincetown.  I have never been there and would like to go one day, but if I wanted a GUIDEBOOK of P-Town it would be more suitable.  Then, as you read on you get glimpses of how the author met his boyfriend in P-Town and his other flings (beforehand).  Sure...you get a little history salt n' peppered in as well--but who gives a crock about the fish that you can find in the Cape Cod shores.  There's a rush to sentimentality with a close friend & former lover who died of AIDS.  You get a mini-bio of Eugene O'neill and his P-Town exposure along with other writers and artists.  There was a line or two about how the author & his boyfriend saw a lithe, gorgeous gay Uncle on the beach that they BOTH wanted &/or wanted 'to be' that was supposed to shock me--but it didn't.  I think this is a great book for a \\"single\\" gay guy or lesbian who's planning to visit Provincetown.  I just think this is SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT for a follow-up to one of my A+ FIVE STAR ratings of his Pulitzer Prize winning, THE HOURS.  This should win the \\"SPRITZER LET DOWN\\" PRIZE.	2002-09-02

I think I found it via a recommended reading list by another author, Michael Cunningham.  It alternates each chapter from childhood to present day which can be an interesting way to parallel a story.  It follows the story of a middle-aged woman with grown children who finally finds happiness.  This novel could be construed as a story intertwined with self help for anyone.  The title, ACTS OF GOD, was something I was drawn to as I wanted to read about things that are beyond our control.  Perhaps the events of September 11th reeled me in to this one.<br />Here are lines that I appreciated from the book:<br />1. ...there are only solutions, never problems.<br />2. ...I like the feel of...looking at a great painting and hearing a piece of music I haven't heard before...<br />3. I returned home to find my life in disarray, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle scattered on the ground.  Pieces were missing and what I had didnt' fit together anymore.<br />4. Poetry does not arise from nowhere.  We all know that the writer draws from what he or she knows.<br />5. ...a 'desire path' is what hikers or walkers have worn thin through finding a better way, or a shortcut, to a desired place.<br />6. I want something that's mine.  My house, my work.  Not what other people want me to have.  Do you understand that?<br />7. How can you explain this?  One day she is there.  And then she is gone.

This was extremely well written (it was a National Bestseller way back in the early 1980s--after all), but it seemed like an outline for four different books.  One part seems like a staging for a woman who is on sexual overdrive and needs to attend a sexaholic seminar.  Another part intertwines the interesting correspondence between a patient and her Dr. Sigmund Freud.  The third potential book deals a lot with grief and dealing with the loss of loved ones.  Lastly, there are explicit glimpses of the trials, tribulations and horror of the Holocaust.  I'd be lying to say I didn't get something out of the book because I most certainly did.  It's just that it would have been a better 4-volume book with 4 different stories/novels.  A few lines that captured me in the book were:<br />-Seeing the fresh grief of others had had the effect of putting distance between her and her bereavement.<br />-Generosity always rewards the giver.<br />-Our childhood memories show us our earliest years not as they were but as they appeared at the later period when the memories were aroused.<br />-...much will be gained if we succeed in turning your histerical misery into common happiness.<br />-Freud wrote (regarding the death of his own mother): With...a feeling of liberation, of release, which I think I can understand.  I was not allowed to die as long as she was alive, and now I may.  Somehow the values of life have notably changed in the deeper levels.<br />-Sometimes I crave more stimulating company.<br />-She was homesick, as only the very young and the very old can be.<br />-There are worse fates than to be lonely.	2002-07-25

It was titled APRICOTS ON THE NILE, A Memoir With Recipes.  I just realized via a search on Amazon that the title is different here in the USA.  I like the English title better.  This book is a 'must get' for anyone who cooks.  There will be some recipes that sound \\"ugh\\", but many are mouth watering.  Personally, I liked the Tomato Salad(s), Roast Chicken on a Bed of Leeks, Meatballs with Apricot Sauce, Angel Hair Pasta with Nuts, Vegetable Salad, Traditional Hummus, Christmas Four-Meat Pate, Lentil Soup, and Roast Leg of Lamb.  The book is more than just recipes, though.  You will be taken on a cultural trip through Cairo, Egypt and Paris, France through the eyes of a little girl & a woman who has not lost sight of her ancestral heritage.

Songs like ANYTHING GOES, YOU'RE THE TOP, I LOVE PARIS to name a few are classics to no end.  I like a book that takes me back in time, but I'd prefer a good story.  I was a bit disappointed how the book became too informational with naming of who's who and who did what vs. a classic story.  There are definitely stories behind the stories that would be much more interesting...so, I suppose we have to use our imagination.  This book is a great resource to anyone studying about Cole Porter.  I had no idea about his horse accident which really put a damper on his lifestyle.  He was quite the world traveler in the 20s &amp; 30s which is quite an accomplishment in those days.  He definitely had a way with words...but if you read this...complement it with a CD of the COLE PORTER Songbook.  It took me a while to get through this because it IS a book that you can put down &amp; keep on your coffee table for a long time (before you pick it up again).	2002-06-26

I've been visiting London a lot lately so it makes it more interesting to me when I go by Southwark, Buckingham Palace, Fortnum &amp; Mason, St. Pauls Cathedral and/or see specific street names and realize some of the British history.

This isn't exactly a top-notch literary piece but it is definitely direct & 'to the point'.  My sister in law,..who is a loving parent of 4 children recommended the book(s).  It's a very EASY READ--but a sad one.  I read it in one night.  I had to finish it because I wanted it to end.  The child abuse from a childs point of view was just too much to take.  It makes most people realize how good we've had it.  What a shame this child had to endure this pain.  I think people will learn from this book and see things differently about how children are OUR FUTURE.  The only good part is that the author survived this and came out brilliant!

It is quite revealing of the past.  The diary will take you into the mind of a woman who found herself in a torrid relationship with a wealthy man in the early 1900s.  She forced herself to love this man.  I would definitely give this book a solid B as it is a GOOD form of reading a womans' thoughts almost a century ago.  The romantic woman, Ellen, was in the forefront for the benefit of women, having some power at that time.  Ellen was in touch with her sexuality and even found pleasure with her chambermaid, Sukeena.  The relationship with her husband was much more physical and forceful (and she learned to enjoy it at times--yipes!).  The mysterious events at Rose Red (their home) make one wonder about the supernatural.  The wonders of a seance and disapperances of people are only a small part of the reminiscences by Ellen.  I found the diary format quite fascinating, superstitious and easy to read.  I especially liked how I had to refer to a website for the \\"steamy & provocative\\" missing excerpts/entries that were not suitable to be printed in the book!  A few lines that captured me were:<br />Dare I write this, when writing seems so final an act?<br />We live under a magnifying glass.<br />All children spend time in their make believe worlds.<br />Oh, if that's not the pot calling the kettle black!  While John lifts the skirts of his dockside whores he condemns Douglas for taking up with his pale young men.<br />No walls exist between Sukeena and me.<br />In just seven short years my life has so drastically changed to where even I do not recognize it.<br />We're all afraid of something, dear.  Never fear the truth.  It's the only real passport you have to reach new levels of understanding.  You may find it corny, but the truth can set you free.	2002-03-06

I learned of the book while reading 'THE SCARLET PROFESSOR--Arvin Newton'.  I was anxious to read it because the book was banned in 1947 because of its heatedly debated subject matter of descriptive sex, adultery, venereal disease and a mixture of the upper and lower class values of the time.  My dear friend, Gloria Weiner-Freiman-Cohen, would surprise me with the gift of this book.  While I was pleasantly surprised the author, Edmund Wilson, has encouraged me to write in my journal again as he did nightly in his 'Wilson's Night Thoughts'--(everyone has NIGHT THOUGHTS, right?).  I'm sure that is an interesting book as well.  This book is written in a very 'twenties style' of literary competence that I truly love.  It just sweeps me back to the beauty of words that are often not used in this manner today.  I liked the following lines from the book:<br />-Right is right and wrong is wrong and you have to choose between them!<br />-...it's the dead...that give life its price, its importance.

I always liked her.  Who wouldn't after seeing her films?  The author kind of goes overboard by being very repetitive at times...but once you get past that you can get into what matters.  The author gets good insight via interviews from various contacts which allows one to decipher what is true &amp; what probably is not.  I found it fascinating to learn that Natalie divorced her husband, Robert Wagner, (the first time) after she found him in a compromising position with another MAN.  Everyone knows she was a victim of child stardom...but I'm not sure everyone knows about what an obsessive stage mother she had.  All in all...there are a lot of names dropped in the book that make it very interesting for any fan.  It was sad that the world lost her at such an early age.  She was bound to win an Academy Award eventually...she had that excellent acting ability &quot;in&quot; her.  I liked her more after reading the book because I could tell she was a unique lady.  I was surprised to learn how she 'slept around' in her early years.  Then again, the end of her life still has an aura of mystery.  You, the reader, are left to determine what really happened with the tidbits of facts given.	2001-12-31

I'll tell you right now that it is NEVER too late to read this book.  It's a 'slice of life'.  It's real-life with real lives that render characters that shine.  It reminds us of the struggles we all go through in life.  It's a beautiful story that revolves around the life of Francie and her family.  It's no wonder that so many have told me how wonderful this book is to read.  I underlined scores of lines that made me want to go back to re-read them...to be reminded of how to live my life or how to advise other people.  This book would make a special gift for any one.	2001-12-06

However, it's still worth taking the time to get lost in the authors' world.  It took me to a new culture and another part of a dramatic world.  It's interesting how a world apart is really so much the same in any world.  There were two storylines about an uncle &amp; his niece that merged into one as if a masterpiece.  Each chapter began with a profound verse from the Tirukkarul.  I am utterly excited about finding his first award-winning first novel called Funny Boy.  The research done is apparent.  There were so many wonderful lines in this book.  Here are a few of my favorites:<br />The different stages of a man's life are often reflected in the guests he invites to his annual dinner.<br />...choices are never easy.<br />But what life is without its regrets.<br />They're, you know...inverts. 'Friends of Oscar', as Aunty Ethel used to say.<br />You disappoint me to the very core.<br />...I always knew that man was a snake in the grass.<br />The last part of a novel was always her favorite.<br />As you well know, when people act according to their opinions they can end up ruining other lives.<br />I refuse to let our friendship end as it stands...In silence.<br />Yet, simultaneous with this love, he felt a burning shame.<br />I, too, have things in my life that I keep hidden from others.<br />Certain wrongs must be righted.<br />...we might, through our letters, stegnthen the bond between us...AND MANY MORE!	2001-11-10

It's lucky to get that when I barely cared for the characters at all.  It's a simple story based on the author finding letters that belonged to his grandfather.  It was a nice concept for a book but the story really moved too slowly.  Here it is World War I with a doctor separated from his New York family while in France.  The doctors' letter writing clearly renders his loving infatuation with a young nurse while dealing with medical antidotes.  The writing seemed relatively good but the story lacked intrigue and interest.  It's a mix between a family surviving without the head of household and a 'want to be' love story.  Why I chose to finish the book is beyond me, but I did underscore some beautifully written excerpts such as:<br />A true intellect rushes on with what it has to say without stopping to admire its penmanship. (I think the author stopped to admire his handwriting--that's for sure!)<br />I don't think I'll ever marry. ...a book can be far better company than a silent man or an irritable woman.  Why not spend your life with books?  (not this book!)<br />Stop this quarreling.  There is too much to be grateful for.<br />(Okay, the author made an effort.)<br />His pages were still secrets locked in a desk. (more secrets and development needed to be unlocked for this book to work)<br />If the city's grid was a chessboard, she moved across it with the queen's whim and freedom, a celebrity denying a destination, as if bound to keep moving for her own security. (Hmmm...could the writer of this book moved along too quickly with whim &amp; freedom as well?)<br />Without rubbing their noses in his contentment, he was eager to share experience. (There were a few touching moments but it was hard to feel emotion when I never embraced the characters to begin with.)	2001-10-18

It was a B+.  It's about the literary life of Newton Arvin who was shattered by a scandal in 1960.  I was born in 1959 so it was interesting to me to read of what was going on at the time.  It ventures into the closeted homosexual literary elite.  This book gave me other book ideas that I really want to read like: The Scarlet Letter by Hawthorne, Letters &amp; Leadership by Van Wyck Brooks, Roderick Hudson by Henry James, Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, Memoirs of Hecate County by Edmund Wilson, Other Voices, Other Rooms by Truman Capote, and other books that were actually written by Newton Arvin.  This book is a great book for any aspiring writer and/or a lover of literature.  A few lines that captured me in the book that will give you a flavor for it are:<br />It seems our worst fears are always more than justified.<br />I shan't advise you.  If I were you I would follow my impulse or interest, and get to work.<br />He recoiled from loving and from being loved, which, taken away, left little worth living for.<br />He felt more trapped in Northampton...which, if nothing else, had made small-town life easier to bear by fostering certain illusions: stability, permanence, and a sense of home.<br />He craved solitude, a place of his own as a tranquil and sacred abbey.<br />'You know how much I love you'...'It is a luxury only to allow oneself to SAY it from time to time.'<br />...if I ever really began a 'letter' to you it could have no imaginable end--or even beginning--for it would just have to circle for ever and ever, like a great wheel, about the one central fact...<br />Like most of us aging and lonely people, what he wants is it get away from HIMSELF &amp; unfortunately you take yourself wherever you go!<br />In short, there are sunny days, and there is memory, and--hardest of all--there is choice.<br />...the deepest betrayals usually came not from one's enemies but from one's friends and associates.	2001-10-01

I waited about six months before I chose to plunge into the second book in the Harry Potter series. I just had too many other books to read on my list. Anyway, I'm glad I decided to read this one. The one thing about Harry Potter is that you (the reader) escape to a fantasy world filled with magical fun. I love how the books end with key morals to the story, too. There are definite messages that we must live by. The last 4 or 5 chapters in this sequel really keep one on edge for 'what happens next'! I understand HP &amp; The Sorcerers' Stone (Philosophers' Stone), the movie, is released on Nov. 19, 2001 here in the U.S.  Warner Brothers quickly starts filming the sequel (Chamber of Secrets) in Nov. 2001 for fear of the stars getting older--haha. I can't wait to see the movie...from the character still photos I saw in the Vanity Fair Oct. 2001 issue it will be Magical Fun...and relatively close to the book storyline so we (Potter Reading Fans) shouldn't be too disappointed.	2001-09-17

She has a way of becoming the character.  I could tell when she wrote through the eyes of the child, Bo.  A couple of my favorite lines while reading were:<br />Laughter was evidence of a person's value...<br />Who needs words when you can say everything you need to say with your eyes?<br />All images had stories to tell, causes to explain.<br />The story will make you smile in some parts as you reminisce about being a child all over again.  There are moods of alarm during a few sudden and unexpected events.  A few days after completing the book the story made me wonder what is real and what is not (make believe).  The reviews on this book were amazing which caught my eye.  I am truly glad I read it.  You won't feel left out when you're done.  It is a worthwhile book!	2001-09-04

One of my dearest and most intelligent lady friends urged me to read this book.  She said I would laugh out loud.  I really did laugh out loud.  I didn't want the book to end.  It's one of those books that is in journal entry format.  Every new day was like a new episode in a cliffhanger soap opera.  It clearly shows the capability of how much influence and manipulation teenagers really have over adults.  What a 'fun-filled' piece of work.  I started this book on July 4th, 2001 and made it last until I finished it in London at midnite on August 16, 2001.  I strongly recommend this well-written book that reminds us that LIFE IS TRULY FULL OF SURPRISES.	2001-09-04

It was a British bestseller at the time.  I was intrigued by the title.  It ended up reminding me how &quot;lucky&quot; I have been in my life.  Life is unpredictable and we must be happy no matter what it takes.  There was one event in the book that TOTALLY surprised me, catching me totally offguard.  That's a 'real find' in a book!  This isn't a depressing book...it's a book about real-life, love and savoring the present moments filled with happiness.  Interesting lines for me:  As the lead character, Harry Silvers' father is dying:  'The worst thing about it', my father whispered in the darkness, 'is knowing what you will be missing.  I don't mean the things that haven't happened yet--Pat's wedding day, seeing you finally settle down--but the things that you take for granted.  Seeing Pat ride his bike, telling him a story, kissing him goodnight.  Watching him running around the garden with his bloody light sabre.  All those small things that mean more than anything.'	2001-07-06

I started it and was flabberghasted to learn that Katherine Grahams' parents lived in my hometown (Alameda, CA) for a short spell.  Then, I put the book to the side and never finished it.  I finally put my foot down and completed the book from 6/24/01-7/4/01.  It's a great book to finish on the 4th of July with all of the Presidential gossip salt n' peppered throughout the book.  I found the stories about her parents most interesting.  I was surprised to learn that her husband Phil was a manic-depressive.  Coincidentally, he worked for RAND...just like John Forbes Nash (the Nobel Prize winner a la A BEAUTIFUL MIND)...I wonder if working for that establishment has an negative impact on the employees.  You wonder about these secretive employers that would get any one paranoid--the CIA included.  I could have done without so much of the boring Watergate &amp; The Pentagon Papers time that the book allowed, but she made it worthwhile.  If you're interested in journalists, the Washington DC high-life and/or the Washington Post Company you'll enjoy this book.  Katherine Graham is one lady to be admired.  She's had a wonderful life with another decade or two to go...I'm sure.  It's no wonder that this book won the Pulitzer Prize with the historic news &amp; her profound philosophy and wisdom-sharing for living life and dealing with suffering (loss of parents/husband). One of my favorite lines in the book:  THERE IS NO GREATER WEALTH THAN HEALTH.	2001-07-05

The author, Heinrich Boll, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1972.  It's clear as to why he won the Prize after reading this book.  It's a well-written European Classic.  I forget how I discovered it.  I think I saw it listed as required reading for a Literature class somewhere in New York.  It's about a German Soldier and his adventure on a train as he envisions and wonders how he will die.  The 'Twilight Zone' ending comes only too SOON.  Great book with some great lines...like the one that reminded me that life is beautiful and that cheese, white wine, bread and cookies make for a glorious meal.  It's true.  I tried the simplicity of this glorious meal, today, on this summer afternoon of June 23,2001.	2001-06-24

I was happy to read that I already practice a lot of the advice in the book.  The last thing I want to do is get angry and harm my inner self (and/or my internal organs).  The book reminded me of the importance of spirtuality.  It is a great handbook for living.  I strongly recommend this book for anyone trying to move on from any sort of suffering (death, divorce, argument, career blues, etc.) which means we would ALL find this book useful.  It's true that we all have one unique goal as human beings: happiness.  This book is a great starting point for MORE happiness in our lives.  I highlighted so many significant lines in the book.  As an example:  As products of an imperfect world, all of us are imperfect.  Every one of us has done something wrong.  OR  It would not be helpful...if I let that feeling of regret weigh me down, be simply a source of discouragement and depression with no purpose, or interfere with going on with my life to the best of my ability.

Cigarette smoking accellerates the aging process.  Is the human brain and head a maternal inheritance (Thanks mom)?  Could 'mad cows disease' have occurred just because some farmer decided to have parent cows mate w/their offsprings to create super-cows?  There are a lot of 'eyebrow raising' genetic experiments that have already happened that no one really talks about.  Yes, Dolly was cloned---are humans far behind?  It's going to be interesting to see what happens next (in real life w/this whole gene therapy business).  I strongly recommend this book for anyone.  There are some highly scientific-technic lines in this book that can easily be skimmed over.  It is certainly a GREAT book for any biologist, immunoligist or scientist because it sparks excitement to be 'in the know' or 'the ease of researching a new discovery'.  The field is wide open.  The book reminded me of a film called GATTACA that I'd seen a few years back--that movie could have been seen as a sci-fi sort of film---but how close to reality is it?  Read this book and gain insight to your own intelligence.  After this book I'm anxious to see A.I.-Artificial Intelligence, the new Spielberg film, that is being released this month, June 2001.  I'm sure it will give us more of a glimpse of what the Human Genome Code has in store for us in the future.	2001-06-07

I learned of this book while reading a magazine about this bestselling novel from 1993 which has been passed around to various movie studios.  The film version still has not been made but Ben Affleck was interested in playing the lead role.  I don't know if the film will ever be made due to the controversial subject matter for today's society.  However, one day it will happen.  It was an innovative story with a happy ending.  An All-American blonde, blue-eyed, married baseball star falls in love with his good-looking black second baseman.  It has all of the homophobic hoopla from executives and middle America baseball fans.  It ends up being a story about tolerance.  I wouldn't call this book a literary find or anything.  I just read The Great Gatsby (one of the finest literary novels by F. Scott Fitzgerald) so, this was no competition.  I will give it an &quot;A&quot; for being daring and innovative though.  I am glad the book was written because there is definitely a heartwarming message here.  If someone is different...there's no reason to make him out to be an outcast. If you read the book &quot;right&quot; you can sense the tenderness. I love how the author writes that all men are created equal; that they are entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.	2001-05-19

It's got a mix of Italian Mafia blended with Alfred Hitchcock-like suspense.  I'd love to see this sequel made into a film like THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY.  The subtle homosexual hints in the book made me realize that the female author had plenty of gay friendships.  In any case, she had a great talent for writing that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  A few lines in the book that I liked were: There's no such thing as a perfect murder. That's just a parlor game, trying to dream one up. Of course you could say there are a lot of unsolved murders.  That's different... Gone was the excuse of paintings that Tom wanted framed.  One didn't help Tom kill people, help him get rid of corpses, because one was going to frame a few pictures.	2001-05-19

I appreciated the foreword, preface, afterword, explanatory notes &amp; the notes about the author by Matthew J. Bruccoli which enlightened my eyes before I started on the path of reading The Great Gatsby.<br />It's funny that somehow my high school English teacher skipped this as required reading for me in the mid to late seventies.  I bought the book for my niece, Ashley, a few years ago.  I remembered a co-worker, Kim, who was an avid reader who once told me that The Great Gatsby was her all-time favorite book.  I was curious.  It's strang that it took my 17 year old niece to 'get me on the bandwagon' to finally read this classic book at age forty-one.  It amazes me to realize that the author, F. Scott Fitzgerald, died at age forty-four in Southern California on December 21, 1940, believing himself a failure.<br />It's quite clear that Fitzgerald's ideas may have been 'made up' but he sued real life people, his own experiences and other true events to make his story.<br />In retrosprect, the novel contains a story of money, greed, love, deceit, suspense, hate, alcoholism, stress, passion, time, ambition, death, life, status, 'leaving a mark in life', pleasure, vacation, free time, heroes, lies, trust, women vs. men, the 1920s, mystery, intrigue, romance, poor vs. rich, Sundays in the park, art, happiness, choices, fashion, lust, loneliness, friendship, adventure, honesty, making conversation, scenic views, people, music, dance, avoidance, communication, observation, summer, intelligence, panic, forgetting, agin, laughter, family values, prejudice, jealousy, past, future, youth, tranquility, grief, responsibility, self-improvement, self-actualization, carelessness, escaping and living life.	2001-05-11

I think what is missing here is the flow.  It's not a book where you finish each chapter and you have to 'keep reading'.  You can set it on a table...and quite possibly wait a year to pick it up again.  The story is relatively simple--with a few eyebrow raisers here &amp; there.  The writers' writing is the only thing that captures the reader (me).  I'd highly recommend this author read the book, THE HOURS by Michael Cunningham or MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA or THE NOTORIOUS DR. AUGUST...then, you'll read a story that 'flows'.	2001-05-01

I was curious as to what was going on in the mind of this person.  Unfortunately, you don't get into the underlying PERSONAL feelings, emotions and thoughts of the main character/author.  The title really caught my eye (No One's Perfect) and I thought it would explore more facets of human imperfection.  While you initially feel sorry for Oto just from seeing the photo on the cover of the book...by the end, you come to visualize him as a real and regular person.  I found the book to be a more of a scrap together simplistic journal of his life so far.  I suppose I have never discriminated against the disabled as it's obvious they've lacked something through life. Each individual finds their own way and it's clear that Oto points out how we must value ourselves more &amp; enjoy every single day no matter what. This book is ideal for a little inspiration for any one (at any age) because it is easy to read &amp; helps one examine 'What one should do to make a difference in improving their life'.	2001-04-04

You slip about and lose your footing.  It's nice and easy and clear and brilliant for many pages...then, you suddenly feel you've not been paying attention.  The author would say those periods are precisely the places you (the reader) have to identify as that is where the writer decides to add and hide things.  The book is VERY well written.  I learned a lot from the historical aspects of the novel.  There are four intersecting stories going on in this book and I think four separate EXCELLENT novels would have been a better arrangement. It does assist in telling you that 'I have to discover myself again'.  And it profoundly hints that success comes from a little good luck, talent, knowledge and prestige.  I also laughed when I read a line in the book: 'You are tormenting yourself needlessly' as that was how I felt at certain moments of reading this novel.	2001-03-30

It's a very revealing story and it is TRUE which made it all the more eyebrow raising.

It's sad that such a creative man, Versace, had to die in such a random &amp; thoughtless way.	2001-03-05

Seven stories that have some connection to each other in some various ways.  This was an international bestseller which I did get something out of &amp; I would recommend it.  Depending on 'YOU' this book can be as DEEP as you want it to be. Each story gave me something different--here's the premise &amp;/or what I got out of each: Story 1: Personal letters reveal secrets. Story 2: Exploratory love works for those willing to explore.  A childhood memory returns and a true to life fantasy is created.  A mothers arrival is pleasantly expected for a given time frame. A mothers visit adds a bit of controversy. A mothers departure reeks of soft spoken love. Story 3: There are many good reasons to smile, laugh, and dance in a circle.  Living is happiness.  Laughing is living profoundly. Story 4: A yearning and hope to read one's long lost written words are revisited.  The realization that every one without exception bears a protential writer within him. Story 5: A story of love &amp; hopelessness between a 'pretty boy Prague student' and a married woman.  A parable for the aspirirng poet &amp;/or writer. Story 6: Is forgetting a voyage to dying?  Real music epics (symphonies) are a thing of the past.  Sex is not love but merely a territory love takes over.  Is the closeness of death all but a carefree childlike dream? Story 7:  The border of realization where 'everything' no longer has meaning is examined and clearly visible in our lives with repetition.	2001-02-22

Ok...this book missed 5 stars by just a rabbit hair. My cousin, Laura Whithorn, was reading this book last year.  I added it to my wish list &amp; my other cousin, Carol Lucero, bought it for me during Christmas 2000.  Yes, it's about twin boys and one is a schizophrenic but it's more than just that psychological exploration.  It explores 'growing up' and one's past.  It makes you think of your own past.  I liked how the author wrote: Think of your past as a well in the ground.  Wells are good things, are they not?  They give life-sustaining water, they replenish.  Well, this book really grabs you with interest when you get into the twins' Italian Grandfathers' life-story manuscript.  What a dramatic story!  It is mentioned that parables instruct and this entire story does teach you...I know this much is true!	2001-02-18

I think someone recommended this book to be about six months ago while I was visiting Colorado Springs.  I was quite moved by this story from the eyes of a child amid such horror in the Cambodian-stricken country enduring war, havoc, and famine.  While it is a sad story about family...in the end...it's such a relief to know that Loung Ung, the author, was finally saved by an American sponsor to come to the USA-Vermont.  And what a beautiful place Vermont is...from one culture shock to another.  Great book!  It's a reminder to us all...that the basics in life are what really matter: food, shelter, clothing, love!	2001-01-13

I saw this book advertised in the NY Times Book Review one Sunday.  Random House was apparently banking on this first time novelist by spending their marketing dollars.  I think I was most attracted by the choice words given the title of the book.  I was disappointed in the novel because it seemed to ramble on at times without substantial storyline.  I found many philosophical lines that I did learn from.  I wish the book had focused more on the character named Templeton who seemed to be the most intellectually stimulating of all of the characters.  It was nice to imagine scenes in Africa from what the author had to offer, having lived there for a couple years.  I wouldn't totally knock this first novel effort as these lines in the book significantly attracted my attention: WE MUST PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT OUR HEART PREFERS--FOR OURSELVES AS MUCH AS OUR WORK. MAYBE IT'S TWILIGHT THAT MAKES WESTERNERS SO SENTIMENTAL.  THEY CAN SIT ON THEIR PORCHES AND WATCH DAY RECEDE AS NIGHT APPROACHES.  IT GIVES THEM TIME TO CONSIDER WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE.  IT'S LIKE DYING SLOWLY VERSUS BEING SHOT. FREEDOM IS KNOWING YOU ARE A SLAVE AND HAVING THE RESOURCES TO CHOOSE YOUR SERVITUDE. THE PROBLEM WITH ENGLAND IS THAT NO ONE REALLY CONVERSES ANYMORE...THEY ARE MAGNIFICENT AT CHITCHAT.  TRUE DIALOGUE TRANSFORMS.  WE MUST WORK AT IT. DO YOU KNOW THE ORIGINS OF THE TERM GOOD BYE?  IT MEANS 'GOD BE WITH YOU'.  SO, YOU SEE, GOD'S BEEN THERE ALL ALONG. IT WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE TWO OF THEM TAKEN BY SOME WAITER AT A RESTAURANT.  HARD EVIDENCE OF HAPPINESS. WELL, IT'S TIME YOU LEARNED TO SURVIVE ALONE.  NOTHING WORSE THAN DEPENDING ON SOMETHING OR SOMEONE FOR DIRECTION.  THINGS AND PEOPLE CAN DISAPPEAR OVERNIGHT. RELAXATION AND PHYSICAL MANIPULATION THROUGH TOUCH IS THE BEST, MOST NATURAL WAY TO HEAL. DO YOU EVER LET YOUR MIND WANDER, OR DO YOU ALWAYS STEER IT?

This was a great book that explored two diverse cultures mingling in love, work, family, religion, aging, power and secrets.  It's a vacation to China without actually going.  The proverbs, poems and phrases written within the story will stay with you forever.  It's so meaningful and will provide a psychological balance for any one.  If you are Chinese or Jewish this is a &quot;required reading&quot;!  Although, I am a native Californian who was brought up as a Roman Catholic.  My ancestry is from Spain and I clearly found some Jewish roots in my mothers' anscestors.  And so, this book offered some answers to questions that I've always had in the back of my mind.  In the end, you'll learn that, today, we are a world of diverse peoples' who must work together lovingly and happily.  There is a great love story intertwined in this wonderful novel, too.  it was a great reminder of how the peoples of our past have blood-lined the present populations while we will, henceforth, be a part of future generations.	2000-12-10

Thomas Mann, the author, in a well reknown German-born author who gained success from his novellas.  He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1929.  He left Hitler's Germany in 1933 &amp; settled in the US in 1938 until he eventually returned to Europe &amp; died in Switzerland in 1955.  This 'Death In Venice' story had a curious draw for me at is was referenced in the book Density Of Souls by Christopher Rice and in another book I'd read. The story is short and very philosophical about an aging artist on vacation in Venice, Italy.  It is literally a beautifully written 'escape'.  You feel the aura of Venice as you conjure mythic images in what the artist sees as beautiful.  It really is a magical book in more ways than one.  I loved reading the following lines in the book (just to pick a few): To persevere through all, however, had always been his motto.;  To know is to forgive.; Art-understood as personal experience, too--is life raised to the higher power.; ...the foreign tongue turned the boy's speech to music...; Ultimately, we are only as old as we feel in our hearts and minds.; ...passion is our inspiration, and our true longing must always remain a desire for love. So...as you can tell, this short novella can be as deep as you make it.  Excellent!!!	2000-11-12

I give this book a solid &quot;A&quot; (five stars).  It was quite enlightening and opened my mind to new things.  It's ultimately a learning experience.  The book offers a person room for one's own intellectual vision.  If you think you're a genius or 'want to be' more of a genius then you should definitely read this book for inspiration.  It's a tribute to the importance of mathematicians.  More than half of the book (Chapters 1-33) will focus on the genius of John Forbes Nash, Jr.  Then, Chapters 34-46 focus on his schizophrenic downfall and &quot;lost&quot; state of mind. By the end of the book, (Chapters 47-50) John Nash Jr. starts to reawaken to the simple sides of life (flashback from the film, Awakenings).  The sad part is that one of his sons is now dealing with his 'on &amp; off switch' mind and John Nash, Jr. is the caretaker.  It reminds us of the mystery of the human mind and how no ONE is immune to getting a distorted view of things.  Balance in Life is so important.  A great biography of a great man who knew &amp; knows great things of which future greatness will  continue to stem from.	2000-11-11

As I read this book...I had flashbacks of three films that I absolutely LOVED: &quot;The Other&quot; Directed by Robert Mulligan in 1972; &quot;The Prince Of Tides&quot; Directed by Barbra Streisand in 1991; &quot;October Sky&quot; Directed by Joe Johnston in 1999.  I found something in common with this author: &quot;Our age&quot;.  I grew up in the 70's and I could relate to his flashbacks as a child in many ways.  There were times when he mentioned names like &quot;Holland&quot; and &quot;little brother&quot; that made me think of the movie &quot;The Other&quot;.  The scandal occurrence in the barn made me think of &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot;.  Growing up as a child in a coal mining town reminded me of the film &quot;October Sky&quot;.  This was really a nice book to read.  I give it a B+.  The writing is excellent if you take the time to 'get into it'.  I liked how he segmented the book into three parts: Tattoos, Hunting, Ashes.  The titles are key remembrances to the main characters' life.  I bet a book could have been expanded on for each of the three parts.  The more I dwell on the book the more I'm glad I read it.  I saw Patti Lupone in 'Matters of The Heart' last night in NYC @ Lincoln Center and laughed to myself when she made a joke about being in love and calling someone &amp; letting the phone ring 20, 30 or 40 times...before answering machines existed.  It's funny...because that joke was written in this book.  It's clear we all get our ideas from SOMEWHERE.	2000-10-30

This was the first book I've ever read by Sue Miller.  I'd heard about her and I wont be running out for another one of her books any time soon.  Yes, she's a good writer; however, it was all of this character build up with a real good story lacking.  I was fooled when I read the title, The Distiguished Guest.  I was hoping for something more mysterious, revealing and thought provoking.  It's essentially a book that reads like a premise to the beginning of a new soap opera for television.  Lily is the matriarch...and when the book is over...you'll ask yourself, &quot;Is that it?  What happens next?&quot;.  I'll admit there were a few lines that I underscored in the book that struck me (but only a few).  I liked reading these lines: In the field alongside their house they have planted young apple trees--Duchess, Grayenstein, Yellow Newton, Jonathon. They have all had a lot to drink by now, and they are talking animatedly about the craziness in their families. These letters are nobody's business but hers.  She wouldn't like anyone, even family, pawing through them after she's gone. The talking simply dried up, the turning away became the state of things between us. &quot;Maybe it's all like dreaming anyway, Lily.  Our lives. You know.&quot; We shall be changed.  O death, where is thy sting. So...if anyone's in the mood for an intro to a soap opera-like book...get this one.	2000-10-21

It reminded me of the discrimination and improper treatments that took place....and most likely...still do...towards patients that find the misfortune to end up in a locked facility.  This book will be rewarding to any one who has felt mentally depressed &amp;/or has known any one who has been.  It's very well written...Like always...I was hoping for more (that's why 4 stars instead of 5 stars).  I liked these lines particularly: No raid tonight.  It was ironic that on this one quiet night he should have woken himself up with a nightmare.  As with all nightmares, the horror lingered...He didn't feel, however, that the underlying conflict had been sexual. OH...And I liked this one line (sounds like me--sometimes): Breakfast, lunch and dinner, he could do with out, but afternoon tea mattered.	2000-10-17

The author of this book was unknown to me.  Now, I'll seek him out.  This book will certainly become a motion picture someday.  If they made his other book (Father of Frankenstein) into the movie, Gods &amp; Monsters...then, this will be up for film rights.  It's an astonishing epic that mixes music into a novel that flows like non-fiction.  It's so well written.  You get caught up in the charachters of Dr. August (Fitz), Isaac, Alice, Fanny/Lady Ashe and more.  What was amazing is that it takes you back in time to a time when something like this could NEVER have been written about.  What a love triangle...I loved experiencing the end of the Civil War, the early 1900's in New York, a cruise ship, London, and Constantinople.  If you want an ESCAPE...this book is your best bet!  I SIMPLY LOVED IT.  There were plenty of significant lines that you'll take with you too...There are just too many favorite lines for me to list here...but the story is quite unique.

This was my first reading experience by Jean Rhys.  I learned that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis included Jean Rhys on her roster of favorite authors.  That's why I bought the book.  I was curious to learn what 'tickled her fancy'. At first...the book was 3 stars...but after a day or two had passed I realized that the book had quite an impact on me.  I had just finished an A+ book (The Notorious Dr. August)...so, maybe that's why I didn't give this 5 stars. It explores loneliness, living on the edge, dealing with death, depression, the cheeriness of childhood, and the search for love.  So, you can imagine why Jacqueline Kennedy loved this author.  I felt the main character, Julia, was easily identifiable by Jackie.  Mr MacKenzie was her Onassis and Mr. Horsfield was her own Mr. Tempelsman in many ways. Although, I saw Julia as a sort of prostitute &quot;in cognito&quot; style. I did gasp when I read 'She's gone'. 'Gone'. That was the word. It struck me because my own sister-in-law called me with those exact words when my mother passed away.  And when she wrote 'Nothing matters. Nothing can be worse than how I feel now, nothing.'  I gasped again because in my eulogy to my mother I started it with those two words &quot;Nothing matters&quot;...as that was how I felt initially.  Therefore, if you know anyone dealing with grief this book should help during some trying moments.  Overall, the book leaves you slightly depressed at the end.  It went full circle.  There were some extraordinarily good lines in this book.  One favorite:  Every day is a new day.  Every day you are a new person.	2000-10-17

On page 24 of that book: &quot;The Pied Piper&quot; has been his favorite story ever since he was a boy.  Well, I clearly felt I was missing out.  I never read the story when I was a boy.  I know I'd heard the title many times...so my curiosity got the best of me. Well...I've read it.  It's a simple fifteen minute read...but worth re-reading another time.  It's a very profound poetic story that should be read under a shady tree because it should be read slowly...realizing its uniqueness.  I think I'll gift it to my nephew who will be turning 8 years old on November 2nd.  If you're in the mood for a poetic story...you must check it out...even if at a library because I'm sure it will be there. It's a Childrens' Classic...C'mon...relive your childhood!	2000-10-04

I suppose I was curious.  I wanted to read about JFK Jr.  I never really read any of the MANY Kennedy books that are out there and available.  It was all NEW to me when I read it here.  JFK Jr. is a year younger than I.  I felt I could relate to him.  Now, he's gone 'to another place' like Princess Diana and my OWN mother and father.  I enjoyed the book but it lacked the more profound and literary aspects that I would have hoped (but then...it's not that type of book).  It was more informational and a trite gossip-filled.  It did have some very good lines in the book.  I enjoyed it, however, sad the ending. Lines of Interest in the book:  He had a legacy and he learned to treasure it. He was part of a legend, and he learned to live with it.--Ted Kennedy, in his eulogy for JFK Jr.----- Then they discussed fate, and &quot;how none of us knows how much time there is left.&quot;----- Jackie told friends that she worried John would become &quot;a fruit&quot; without the toughening influence of a father figure.----- He really wanted to know about other people's lives.----- He grew up with the notion that life has to be lived to the fullest. (Frank Mankiewicz).----- Caroline...recalled that Jackie had instilled a love of literature in both her children, and then recited Prospero's speech from Shakespeare's The Tempest, a play her brother performed at Brown in 1981. &quot;Our revels now are ended,&quot; she quoted. &quot;We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with sleep.&quot;	2000-10-03

I bought the paperback for my mother because it was a topselling paperback romance novel in 1999 and she liked those types of books.  I read it because I wanted to cling to a story that I knew she was recently close to.  Besides, my mother actually told me she really enjoyed the book.  The book does flow like one of those TV &quot;Movies of the Week&quot;.  I enjoyed the 'fun of it' even if it was somewhat predictable at times.  I learned how a simple story of dislike that turned into love could and would make a 'hopeless romantic' (like my mom) swoon with happiness.  One of my favorite lines in the book was: Mom, it's a crying shame you're no longer with us, Sam thought grimly, doing his best to ignore his sulky, curvaceous passenger and focusing instead on the heavy downtown traffic.  You woul've just loved the hell outta this.	2000-10-03

I had LAWNBOY sitting on my bookshelf for a few months until I finally decided to get into it when I noticed a review on the backcover by Michael Cunningham, the reknown author. He described it as a novel of mystery and great beauty.  Now that I've finished reading LAWNBOY I can say that I did enjoy it and, more importantly, I learned from it.  A few of my favorite lines were: And then, as if in gratitude, the tree released itself, little ~red pieces falling now, coating us, sticking in our hair like blessings.------ I had something.  I had power all along and hadn't even known it.------ I saw myself utterly alone in the world, a gleaming wasp inside a bright orange hive, alone with my anguish and raging hot need, and who'd be there to still me?------ The life I'd once taken for granted now seemed decadent and lush, a golden treasure inside a chest.------ &quo t;I mean, wouldn't it be better not to know anything at all, and die--boom--just like that?&quit;------ &quo t;You have to be able to say, 'I deserve to be with someone who's good to me.'&quit;	2000-10-03

I've had the book for about a year before I finally read it because I was into so many other books.  Anyway, it's much to wordy and quite redundant in parts.  It was extremely informational in a historical sense...I grant you that!  It's worth reading for someone who wants to know 'what was' in the Gay New York world in the early part of the 20th Century.  It's clear that homosexuality and heterosexuality are modern terms of the times and the idea that any 'one' person should be labeled one or the other is WRONG...everyone falls somewhere within the two opposite sides of the spectrum.  I'd still recommend this book to any guy that has any bit of attraction for men...like I do. Some of my favorite lines: ...having two names emblematized their participation in a double life.----- At the turn of the century...a bisexual was not attracted to both males and females; a bisexual WAS both male and female.----- ...as one Italian teenager described the attitude of men at his neighborhood pool hall in 1930, the body to enter did not necessarily have to be a woman's.----- The fairy and the queer, not the medical profession, forced middle-class men to consider the possibilty of a sexual element in their relations with other men.----- GAY itself referred to female prostitutes before it referred to gay men;----- In the course of establishing a place for themselves in the city, gay men constantly had to struggle with the public and private agencies of social control, as well as with popular hostility.	2000-10-03

The book was such a bestseller there that it was translated for the States.  Need I say more? While I was in New York City in August 2000 I read in the NY Times Book Review about this book.  It primarily appealed to me because of the review written by Arthur Golden, author of MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA.  I had just finished his book.  Arthur Golden wrote that this book was &quot;Compelling and highly original...You many never read a novel crafted with more wonder and mystery.&quot;  I would agree with that except for Arthur Goldens' book MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA which deserves the same review.  Anyway, that was all it took for me to jot down the title and buy the book at the nearest bookstore.  (Normally, I'd have bought it at amazon.com...but I was anxious.) The Mark of the Angel is simply a love story that takes place during the late 1950s, early 1960s in Paris France.  There's an unexpected tragedy at the end.  There are underlying historic tragic events written in between.  Here are a few of my favorites lines: Excited to find himself alone in his own house with a young green-eyed foreigner who says practically nothing.------ Every person's suffering is the most important, isn't it?------ Contrary to what you'd believed during the first hours, the first days, at most the first months of enchantment, the person you love hasn't radically transformed you.------ The body serves a purpose, it can change the course of history.------ &quot;music is my way of taking part in the struggle, making the world a better place to live...&quot;	2000-10-02

I bought this book as a gift to my mother, Virginia Marie Lucero-Armijo.  She told me she thought it was &quot;so good&quot;.  I am glad I enjoyed a story that she relished over now that she is no longer with me. This novel is very well written.  It was like an escape to another world, namely a small town in Japan called Gion.  It taught be about the lives of a geisha.  It's truly a love story that grasps you in the end (especially).  The words as described in this book delve into the meaning of life as you will learn form a few of my favorite lines from the book: I felt as a bird must feel when it has flown across the ocean and comes upon a creature that knows its nest.------ Was life nothing more than a storm that constantly washed away what had been there only a moment before, and left behind something barren and unrecognizable?------ The swan who goes on living in its parents' tree will die; this is why those who are beautiful and talented bear the burden of finding their own way in the world.------ We lead our lives like water flowing down a hill, going more or less in one direction until we splash into something that forces us to find a new course.------ I did nothing more useful than to kneel there, feeling as much out of my element as a pigeon in a nest of falcons.------ Grief is a most peculiar thing; we're so helpless in the face of it.  It's like a window that will simply open of its own accord.  The room grows cold, and we can do nothing but shiver.  But it opens a little less each time, and a little less; and one day we wonder what has become of it.----- I was dressed in the most formal costume an apprentice wears, a black, five-crested robe and an under robe of red, whcih is the color of new beginnings.	2000-10-02

Virginia Woolf is a writer living in London in 1923. Laura Brown is a housewife who is married to a war hero, living in Los Angeles in 1949 and is entrhalled with reading all of Virginia Woolfs' books.  Clarissa Vaughn is a wealthy independent woman living in Manhattan NYC in 1999 who is nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway (the main character in Virginia Woolfs' bestselling book).  Each story leads to a connection that is deeply moving and passionate.  The writer is so descriptive.  It's no wonder it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1998.  There were so many lines in this book that were of such significance to me in many, many ways.  For example: &quot;----is proud of his ability to discern the history of a face; to understand that those who are now old were once young.&quot;------- &quot;I swoon over the beauties of the world but am reluctant, simply as a matter of reflex to kiss a friend on the mouth.&quot;-------- It is better, really to find the elevator frankly inoperable, and to walk up five flights.  It is better to be free.------- One always has a better book in one's mind than one can manage to get on paper.------- It is like the first disinterested sigh a lover sends over the telephone wires, the sigh that signals the earliest beginning of the end.------- Yes, she thinks, this is probably how it must feel to be a ghost. It's a little like reading, isn't it--that same sensation of knowing people, settings, situations, without playing any particular part beyond that of the willing observer.	2000-10-02

Read this one first and you'll be sure to look for the other Tom Ripley books.  The 1st novel (THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY) is quite exciting while forming a question within you, &quot;Can you really trust anyone?&quot;.  The 2nd novel (RIPLEY UNDERGROUND) keeps the crime-mystery going even further.  It will bring you into the misgivings of the 'art gallery' world. The 3rd novel (RIPLEY'S GAME) merged a bit of Italian Mafia and even more Hitchcock suspense together.  The author had a great talent for writing crime and mystery that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  A few favorite lines from the books: 'There was a faint air of sadness about him now.' 'This evening--today--can we just do nothing?' 'There's no such thing as a perfect murder,' Tom said to Reeves. 'That's just a parlor game, trying to dream one up...'	2000-10-02

My cousin in Colorado Springs let me borrow this book.  It took me five months to finally decide to read it.  It was worth reading even if it has a reputation as a children's book.  It is a fantasy for children but any ADULT would love it if one would simply give this book a chance.  It took me back to the beauty of being a curious child.  There was a great &quot;cliffhanger&quot; feeling after each chapter.  I couldn't wait to learn what happened next.  You will LEARN something if you read this book. Favorite Lines: &quot;...He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark.  Not a scar, no visible sign...to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loves us is gone, will give us some protection forever.  It is in your very skin...&quot;	2000-10-02
US	50856597	R2PN2WWEH0ZXWG	0743406176	699235720	If Only It Were True	Books	5	2	2	N	N	This is a fun &quot;what if&quot; kind of Book !	I actually give this book an A+.  The title caught my eye while reading an article in PREMIERE magazine that Spielberg had purchased the film rights to do a movie based on the book. It was a fun &quot;what if&quot; kind of book that explores an 'almost' loss of life and moments that occurred during a comatose state.  It's an original romantic novel with a lot of meaning intertwined.  A lovely book.  Some of the tricks that the main character, Lauren, did reminded me of &quot;Bewitched&quot; the old TV sitcom that I usd to love and watch as a child.  This book also helped me personally during a difficult time of grieving in my life. One favorite line: &quot;How many realize what a privelege it is to wake and see, feel, touch, hear?&quot;	2000-10-02

I give it an A- (or 4 stars) only because it's  his first novel &amp; there is always room for improvement.  I loved a few  of his lines like why people love the ocean: because it's the farthest you  can go.  Or the line about how people overlook the opportunity in dealing  with death &amp; tragedy via denial,etc.  He touched on some key issues...I  think Christopher Rice is good &amp; I look forward to his next book. I'd  love to meet him in person!	2000-09-15
US	50856597	R1R35ZY2QRSO99	044022103X	10089389	One True Thing: Love What You Have	Books	5	11	13	N	N	A+.  I bought this book for my mother.	My mother passed away (not from cancer), but from heart failure due to a  condition called Mitral Regurgitation.  All she really needed was a valve  replacement but it was too late. My mom's death was very sudden &amp;  unexpected on January 24, 2000. In any case, my mother told me she loved  this book.  I had to read it...especially after she passed away. The story  is a sad one about a mother who is dying of cancer with a bit of a twist  about 'who killed her'!  It taught me that time is precious and to spend  your time with those you love.  There's a line in the book about the best  time of year to die which is January or February during the winter season.  God chose that time of year for my mom, but is there really a &quot;best  time&quot; to die?  Probably not, yet, death is inevitable for everyone and  anyone.  Who knows though...the recent June 2000 'Human Genome Code'  discovery could make human lives last for 200 or more years someday.  This  book has much more detail than the film version, although, Meryl Streep  does an outstanding performance as the mother in the film.  She was even  nominated Best Actress for the film.  The most interesting line in the book  for me:  &quot;February is a suitable month for dying.  Everything around  is dead, the trees black and frozen so that the appearance of green shoots  tow months hence seems preposterous, the ground hard and cold, the snow  dirty, the winter hateful, hanging on too long.&quot;	2000-08-15
