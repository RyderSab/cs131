At the age of 18 and from a broken home he decides to go with a friend and try living on his own in the process he finds himself hanging out in pool hall where he comes upon the idea to start dealing after seeing other drug dealer setup shop there. As he prospers in the drug trade he hooks up with some guys that lead him to a motorcycle club called the rock machine they being one of the gangs in montreal  <br /> <br />It seems kind of ironic that they are called a motorcyle club because for most of the book he explains that being a member of the Rock Machine did not mean that you even had to have a harley as in most motorcycle gangs, also unlike most that are also leather clad the rock machine members had sweaters with their colors and insignia. <br />  The goes from a hangaround to full patch to the point that was really running alot of the gang activity in montreal. It covers alot of the war that was and is going on between the Hells Angels and their associates and the Rock Machine and their associates over the drug trade. The war as described by the author has claimed alot of lives on both sides and by means that they have held nothing back even planning to use some bazookas. I f you followed the news years back occasionally it would be on national news even though it was in Canada. <br /> <br />But as years go and body count rises and along with the stress and the fact he even gets shot 4 times on a attempted hit on his life things begin to change for the author especially in his time of need althoughs he was there for are not there in return when he is looking at a long prison stint. This leads to him becoming a informant which is interesting because his brother was still a full patch when he did so there was a brother on bothsides. He does goes on to explain how they develop a friendship with the Bandidos who eventually absorb themone of the attraction of course was the haterd of the hells angels. <br /> <br />If you red for example Under& Alone then you will probably like this book if you can find it is definitely a fast and interesting read.	2005-06-23

Also the ending as with the last book by James Patterson i felt left alot to be desired. This booked really moved along with a good pace the ending just did not finish off the build up. One side note Lindsays love interest is back Joe Molinari with the deptarment of home land security. Hope you work on better endings Mr. Patterson	2005-05-29

This book has 8 stories about teenage hackers as the title shows. The chapters on average are 20 to 25 pages long so the author does not have very long to go into deep detail of each hacker or group of hackers he delves into there family lifes some but does not have long to go for their hacks and exploits . <br /> <br />Some of the characters are as follow  <br />    <br />  1) Genocide who grew up in a shack in alaska with no electricity  telephone or running water. <br /> <br />  2) Theres joe magee and noid who where complete opposites but curiosity in the familys new vcr would start their interest into computers. A intersting story from the book about joe and the family vcr was when he was 10 he had a problem with insomnia and late night eating because of it.  So one night withsuch problem he goes down stairs to make a pb&j sandwich and when he thinks he is going to get busted he shoves the sandwich into the vcr and a sure mess came about with the heat melting the jelly. <br /> <br />  3) Theres prometheus and explotion with promethius being a self-proclaimed satan worshiper living to deface christian and religous websites. <br /> <br />  One of two out of this group that really amazed me was 15 year old anna moore who had computer friendly parents at age 4 she could read at a 3rd grade level she also was the first female hacker to win the ethical hacking contest at the annual defcon hacker convention in vegas. <br /> <br />  The other one that was really amazing is h.d. moore who started hacking at age 13 who got a job working for the air force before he was 18. He developed on his own alot of programs that are uaed today and even gave a big presentation at a convention at the age of 17. <br /> <br />  I said at the start that this book would change your veiw of hackers in that they are not the teenagers that tv and moives portray or what most of us probably think of they are thekid next door the star quarterback and such not as alot the evil names they choose as shockvalue and that most of these kids go on to productive lives seeing that hacking has become something other than what they veiwed it as away to share info and despies those who made money from it to now the feeling that the most modern day hackers are only concern with damaging and destroying websites. This book is a little hard to get threw if you are a computer novice as far as the terminology.	2004-12-06

The author Carlos Bentos who was originally a resident of uruguay and came to U.S. byway of being a broadcaster for voice of america until he decided to take a chance and opened a resturant and eventually led to an additional 4 more successful resturants all around the washington dc area. A trip to north carolina for trip on a charter boat for marlin led to his desire for the marlin and desire for his own boat. <br /> <br />The author lives in annapolis and ocean city maryland. Ocean city being the area where is boat is docked and where he mostly fish's out of. In a sport fishermans arena dealing with the bill fish which has boats that cost anywhere from 1/2 a million to at least 3 million dollars and crews that can make anywhere from 60,000 to 100,000 or more annual salary he is the only one on his boat except maybe an occasional tournament judge the author is the owner,captain,the mate,and the fisherman. While he fishes for the fun and in tournaments for many different types of bill fish it seems that he mostly is catching white marlin this along the atlantic coast. It descripes how they do catch and release and taggging of the marlins and how this provides migration information. <br /> <br />There is a great chapter in the book were mr. bentos tells how when he was a small boy in his native country while at a family gathering it was his mother who instilled the deep desire and love for fishing. <br /> <br />It is pretty amazing the tournament money that is awarded to the different catergories. The idea a single man doing all the operations on the boat is truly not the norm but it works for the author has won more than 30 competitions including the annual ocean city white marlin tournament which about a 1/4 of the book is dedicated his participation in the tournament of 1996. <br /> <br />If you like this type of book i would recommend \\"The Hungry Ocean\\" by Linda Greenlaw and The Perfect Storm by Sebastin Junger <br />alll though Mr.Bentos does not think to highly of these books or the boat captains of the fishing boats feeling that even though they may have a love for the sea the way they fish using longlines with upto 4,000 hooks is not very skillful nor very glamourous and that they are just building a bank account. <br /> <br />Once again this is an excellent book!	2004-11-21

It was amzaing the description of one of the ipo they were involved in and sold the momment the market started to trade it, they sold and in a minute made 300 thousand dollars. <br /> <br />They started the fund at what appears a perfect time between 1996 and 2001 when the tech stocks where booming.

But this is an experiment could go wrong. This administration can afford to experiment because if it does go wrong bush and his cronies will probably lose some money but they will still have many millions to live on, it will really hurt the middle class on down.  <br /> <br />It is no secret that most of the tax cuts have benefited the so called rich by cutting taxes on estates dividends and savings. All of these people get the most of their income from stocks and real estate. Yes these cuts are for everybody but how many people from the $40,000 level on down can save and invest to get these breaks. Would you not think that if the president really wanted to stimulate the economy he would gear cuts toward the majority. With the tax cuts bush signed into law in 2001 the book shows that for those making $50,000 or less the tax difference is less than a $1,000 compare that that make $500,000 or more they get breaks at least 10 times that amount don't you figure those on the lower end of the scale could use the money the most. <br /> <br />Another example is the estate tax cut while they figure if they cut the tax it will encourage more investment but in reality it has probably encouraged them to save more for there heirs because of course less tax. <br /> <br />Just like in the Reagen era alot of these cuts are based on future years where they figure the economy will be strong but what will the effect be if the economy is in a poor state as it is innow you do not have all the projected revenue  and you have record debt that has to be paid sometime <br /> <br />This book is written so that it is pretty easy to understand on a subject that at times is dry and difficult.	2004-10-29

Books	3	59	108	N	N	Better luck next time  george	Let me start out by saying i really like Mr. Carlin have seen his live performances a few times and they are always well worth the money but this book could have been better alot of this material would be better in a show.    Some of the things he has in the book are such ideas how to convert the 10 commandments to two commandments his usual points to ponder through out the book he discuss's countless euphemisms  and occasional true facts such as                1) There is actually a gay softball world series                       2)An actual radio commerical for a certain diet pill                 that says it works three times faster than star-                 vation makes you wonder if they really tested it.                 3) A idea that third world countries need electricity so why do we not try altternative energy sources there ( wind solar and such).    He also has a bit on why people who believe in ufo's are consdiered kooks and those who believe in organized religion are not.If you have seen any of his shows know that he can be funny with his profanity and also with things that you either think about or deal with in everyday life.    One side point this is the second book i  have read in a week that has a phrase from Hermann Goring during the Nuremberg trials who said \\"whether it is democracy,communist dictatorship,fascism or parliament the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to greater danger.\\"  Makes you think does it not?    All in all this book could have had alot more humor and belly laughs.    You know after seeing alot of these reveiws i had to edit my reveiw. I just thought there was not much humor  i cannot believe how many people are getting upset like one of the other reveiwers stated lighten up folks it is a book you would think that ones who proclaim to be christians would even pick up a bookor anything by him knowing he is a profane though very funny comedian so come on why read something you know will offend you after all it is one persons views	2004-10-18

Now remeber this is a work of erotic fiction so if this subject offends you probably should not read it. <br /> <br />The format of this book his a girl who is writing in her diary starting aat the age of 14 which maybe disturbing to some and covers about two years of her life. As the book description states she starts out being a virgin(her being melissa) and covers her introduction to sex and the many variations she experiences while trying to find the true love she so desires especially after her first time with a boy who probably like most teenage boys just wants her for sex and treats her as such when she thinks she has found love. <br /> <br />With the author being only 17 and the book says that it is fictional memoir you still wonder how much is based on the authors on experiences. <br /> <br />While i know that this is probably not the format for a discussion of morals i disagree with the other reveiwer that this is just trash if this is a work of erotica and not for children and you should be watching what they are reading <br /> <br />This is a book that you probably read in 2 or 3 hours so take a afternoon and give it a read	2004-10-16

If you follow the elction some of this you have heard before but this book is a real eye opener. <br /> <br />For an administration that is pro military and supposedly for the troops they have not backed it up with some of the proposed legislation.One part of the book describes in the build up for the war how superiors threaten analyst with being fired if didnot find info on Iraq that supported the presidents side. As far as supporting the troops Bush wanted to cut benefits for the soldiers they proposed an idea to charge the soldiers $250 dollars to enroll in the VA medical plan. Depending on what part of the country you lived in your heard about families raising money for buying two way radios and walkie talkies to send to the troops it brings out in the book that families were raising money to buy modern bullet proof vest or at least the plates for the old ones also points out how many of the humvees that were not properly eqipped with armor plating yet the administration spends hundreds of millions of dollars on new projects that some proven to be unreliable . Doesnot seem to be having the troops in mind.They surveyed the members of congress and senate about there experience in war there were very few and the same can be said about there children very few are in Iraq i believe the book said 8.Iknew that bush basically did not serve yes i know national guard but did you know that Cheney did not serve he had deferments. <br /> <br />On the economy especially unemployment which i have had to deal with too,the administration has proposed a total 5.5 million jobs being created where are they? One way the president tried to inflate job numbers was by reclassifing jobs by calling jobs in the fast food industry as manufacturing jobs. Yes Bush said he would make 500 million dollars available for job training but in the previous three years he cut it by a billion dollars,he did ask for1 million dollars for job training for the new hires who would be joining his second administration. Found it interesting that from 2001 to 2003 that corporate profits rose 87% while eages after being adjusted for inflation rose 1.1% <br /> <br />Concerning the enviroment whether you are a tree hugger or not you have to figure that we are damaging our world bush is being called one of the worst presidents concerning his enviromental record this being noted by some of his own republicans (republicans for enviromental protection) with a majority of the presidents appointment being individuals from oil gas and mining industries to regulate these industries it kind of seems like turning the fox loose in the hen house. <br /> <br />This is a great and informative book and one to educate yourself on some of the isssues so no matter which side your on read it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-12

While in the title or description of the book it describes Mr. slim as one of the greatest gamblers,i dont know if gambler would be exactly fitiing with the propisition bets that he describes they were not a gamble as he did his homework such as playing ping pong against bobby riggs with a skillet or another man with coke bottles.This man definitely had many talent from track to golf of course poker and many other things playing aginst the likes of jimmy the greek snyder minnesota fats and the likes.<BR> For me one of the funniest parts of the book was when slim doyle brunson and sailor roberts were going to mexico to hunt dove and pigeons they make a deal not to bet amongst themselves and of course this does not last as it seems most professional gamblers will bet on anything and in this instint was a bet how fast doyle could make it up a mountain.Another was a bet withther someone could eat quail for thirty days straight.<br />This follows slim every where from book making to the world series of poker and alot of the old cronies he ran with.Thing that impress me was the fact that he was such a gentleman it open numerous opportunities for him and he has such a reputation he does not have to go look for bets he just has to sort through all he gets and decide which ones to take . If you like gambling your are really going to like this book.	2003-10-11

This so far seems to be the most informative. This book gives a pretty good description of the Great Lakes especially Lake Superior background information on the crew and the investigation. The only thing I did not really like was some of the description of the feelings and the things the crew were going thru I felt there may have been a little to much speculation on ths part.But all in all are great book. The one part that always seems to really stay with me that maybe kind of haunting is the phrase from Gordon's song that says does anyone know where the love of god goes when the waves turn the minutes t hours	2002-10-17
