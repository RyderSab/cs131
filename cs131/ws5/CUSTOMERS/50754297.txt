He was one of the most acclaimed pop singers of the early 1950s, best known as the \\"Cry Guy\\" due to his huge #1 smash, \\"Cry.\\"  She was the proper and overly mannered journalist who wrote the influential New York gossip column, \\"Voice of Broadway.\\"  Today's readers, however, are more likely to recall her 1950-1965 stint as the rather humorless panelist on the long-running game-show \\"What's My Line.\\"  The Game Show Network has been re-running that show for a few years; that's how I become aware of Dorothy Kilgallen, or \\"Miss Kilgallen\\" as the host John Daly generally referred to her.<br /><br />Johnnie and Dorothy met on the show; he was the mystery guest (the panelists had to blindfold themselves during this portion of the show), and I saw this episode a few months before reading this book.  Apparently, an affair soon blossomed between the two, which caused scandal for both of them.  The fact that Johnnie was bisexual and arrested several times for solicitation didn't help matters.  Their affair probably hurt both of their careers, although the rise of rock probably signaled the end of Johnnie's career as well.<br /><br />\\"Johnnie Ray and Miss Kilgallen\\" is a fictionalized account of their relationship.  The married authors, Bonnie Hearn Hill and Larry Hill, apparently did extensive research, but the book is clearly more novel than biography.  The writing is quite good, and the topic is interesting.  Johnnie and Dorothy were celebrities during a fascinating time period, and they were pals with icons like Marilyn Monroe and Ava Gardner.  Frank Sinatra also came into their lives: as an enemy, after Dorothy wrote critical items about him in her column.  To the public, the much older Dorothy presented herself as a mentor of sort to the troubled Johnnie.  Out of the limelight, they lived a life flitting from one celebrity party to another, usually flaunting their affair and totally drunk from too many martinis.  Toward the end, Dorothy's career careens toward oblivion as she becomes increasingly involved in chasing JFK assassination conspiracies.  How much of this book is fictionalized is never completely apparent, but I suppose it's fruitless to quibble or wonder at this point.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed this novel, there are a few flaws, particularly the structure.  Each chapter contains sections told through the characters' eyes - not really a \\"he said, she said\\" novel per se, but along those lines.  What I dislike is that Johnnie's sections are told in the first person, whereas Dorothy's sections are second-person narrative.  I suppose that choice makes sense - Johnnie was a swinging, ring-a-ding kind of guy, and Dorothy was remote.  However, it's simply jarring at times.  The other problem concerns Dorothy herself.  On television, Dorothy was an icy woman, and although handsome in a patrician manner, she is hardly the type of woman around whom a fairly sexually explicit novel probably should be based.  Nevertheless, I mostly enjoyed this novel, and it's strengths far outweigh any misgivings I had.

Some of these cookbooks in this area simply exchange low-fat ingredients (e.g., non-fat cheese) for the original high fat ingredient, which usually sacrifices a great deal of flavor and leads to bland Mexican food.  This book focuses instead on some of the more naturally light Mexican-style foods, such as those using chicken or vegetables.  A wide variety of recipes are covered, including appetizers, salsas and dips, salads, soups, chili, main dishes, and desserts.<br /><br />Although the cookbook is in the Mexican food genre, the focus truly is on Southwestern cooking.  For example, the \\"Corn & Green Chili Spoonbread,\\" although delicious, is hardly something typically prepared in Mexico.  However, serve it alongside some grilled chicken, and you have a terrific, light Southwestern meal.  I've thoroughly enjoyed the recipes I've made from this cookbook.  They strike me as very refreshing, often incorporating lime juice and fresh vegetables.  The \\"Chicken Lime Soup\\" is a great example - one of the brightest tasting recipes I've made in awhile, and with only 8 grams of fat.<br /><br />The recipes include nutritional information, but only fat grams and calories.  Some call for canned ingredients (e.g., chicken broth, diced green chilies), so it would have been helpful to have sodium content listed in particular.  However, this weakness is small compared to the overall quality of the cookbook.  \\"The Ultimate Low-Fat Mexican Cookbook\\" was deservedly a nominee for the prestigious James Beard Awards - the cookbook equivalent of the Oscars.  Although time has dulled the novelty of a low-fat Mexican cookbook, this one is still a winner.	2005-09-25

I also have several of their cookbooks, including \\"Cooking Light: Lose Weight Cookbook.\\"  All in all, this cookbook is pretty good, although a bit disappointing compared to other Cooking Light cookbooks I own.  Recipes are organized by complete meals - breakfast/brunch, lunches/luncheons, casual suppers, and company dinners.  For example, the \\"Sunset Supper\\" consists of a meat dish (Turkey Jalapeno), a starch (Seasoned Vermicelli and Rice), and a veggie side-dish (Snow Pea Stir-Fry).  Many meals also include a dessert and salad.  In addition, a final section has a number of snacks and desserts not paired with a full meal.<br /><br />Users could therefore use this cookbook to plan complete meals.  The calorie count is enumerated for the entire meal, and full nutritional information is provided for each dish.  The recipes run the gamut from simple sandwiches to more upscale faire that could be served at dinner parties.  I've made a number of these dishes, and each recipe has been easy to follow and ended up very tasty.  Recipes from Cooking Light are generally triple-tested, so they usually result in good food.  The \\"Basil Scalloped Potatoes\\" were excellent - one of the best potato dishes I've ever had.<br /><br />Although the cookbook is solid, as are the recipes, a few problems exist.  First, the dishes are light and low-fat, but the full meals are perhaps too high calorie for the average dieter.  The suppers, for example, average around 550 calories.  I have preferred to mix and match recipes from different meal plans, rather than sticking to their delineations.  Second, based on the \\"Lose Weight\\" part of the title, I definitely expected a full diet plan to be included here.  Instead, the standard plan (about 10 pages) that is outlined in most Cooking Light cookbooks is re-hashed here.  The information is good, but I was expecting more detail.  Users hoping to get enough information from this book to start a diet may be disappointed.  Overall, this cookbook is somewhat brief and the title is perhaps a bit misleading, but it contains some excellent light recipes.  Recommended with reservations.ng to get enough information from this book to start a diet may be disappointed.

I haven't bought these packets in years - it's a pain to make and to me they really don't taste any better than bottled salad dressing.  Perhaps their sales have slumped, because this cookbook is aimed at getting readers to buy more of those little packets.  All 59 recipes somehow incorporate this ingredient.  I didn't actually realize that fact when I purchased \\"Casual Entertaining\\" from the bargain book bin at a chain store (I really didn't look closely), and I probably wouldn't have purchased it if I'd known.<br /><br />In some cases, the recipe requires making the dressing with oil first, such as a marinade for chicken.  For other recipes, the packet is added directly to the ingredients as seasoning.  Some of the dishes aren't obvious candidates for salad dressing; however, the packets mostly blend into the background.  The \\"Simple Chili\\" recipe I made, for example, didn't overtly taste like Italian salad dressing.  In fact, the chili was quite good.  I think that many of the recipes would actually taste fine without the dressing, which may be necessary for people on low sodium diets as the packets are loaded with salt.<br /><br />The second theme of the book is \\"casual entertaining,\\" which mostly means appetizers, grilling, and simple saut&eacute;ed recipes.  I'm not sure if I'd serve many of these recipes when I'm entertaining, as they're all pretty basic.  However, I would make some of these recipes for a quick weeknight meal or a family get-together.  Unfortunately, no nutritional information is included for recipes; perhaps a bigger problem is that some of the recipes don't include the number of servings produced.  For example, the chili recipe just indicates a yield of 5 cups, and many others don't even include that much information.  Overall, \\"Casual Entertaining\\" is a decent short cookbook collection with some tasty recipes; some of which are depicted in color photos.  However, the recipes are fairly basic and aimed squarely at getting the reader to buy more Good Seasons salad dressing packets.However, the recipes are fairly basic and aimed squarely at getting the reader to buy more Good Seasons salad dressing packets.	2005-07-20

This small cookbook includes 50 recipes that incorporate the noodles.  The recipes run the gamut from soups to salads to stir-fries to a burrito.  I've made several of these recipes and have been very pleasantly surprised by how good they taste; I particularly like the Pseudo Szechwan Ramen recipe.  Another plus is that many of these recipes do not use the ramen seasoning packet for flavoring, which is great given its extremely high sodium content.<br /><br />I've always liked ramen and have often made up my own recipes by adding some veggies or cheese.  However, these recipes are a step beyond anything I've ever created with ramen.  The only problem is that some of the recipes call for either a relatively long list of ingredients or use an ingredient that the average person is unlikely to have on hand, such as Szechwan sauce or gorgonzola.  In particular, many of these recipes would not be good for the college ramen crowd, as they're not necessarily cheap.<br /><br />Ignore the cutesy format, especially the lame \\"games,\\" and this cookbook is a winner for ramen fans.	2005-07-13

The cookbooks certainly aren't the worst on the market, but they are often below par.  \\"Cooking Light: Mexican\\" is typical in that regard.  On the positive side, all the recipes are accompanied with attractive full-color pictures as well as full nutritional information.<br /><br />However, the recipes are usually just a bit off.  A good example is the Tostadas - the recipe says to make the tostada shells with flour tortillas browned in the oven.  This is wrong for a number of reasons: 1) tostadas are usually made with corn tortillas, 2) the flour tortillas bubble in the oven, making it almost impossible to spread the beans evenly, and 3) corn tortillas are lower in fat and calories than flour tortillas, making them a more appropriate choice for a light cookbook.  I made a few recipes from this cookbook but won't make any more.  \\"Cooking Light: Mexican\\" is not a terrible cookbook, especially at a budget price.  However, there simply are many better light Mexican cookbooks on the market.	2005-07-09

Each page features an image of a female from a vintage 1940s or 1950s advertisement.  Thus, I anticipated the humor to lampoon the type of domesticity seen in ads from this era.  Pictures of women in gleaming kitchens whipping up perfect meals are perfect fodder for sharp humor about conformity and such.  Instead, the ads are accompanied by brief captions, most of which are the equivalent of, \\"You go girl!\\"<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the book very much.  Of the approximately 60 pictures, I laughed at about four of them.  The pictures are nostalgic and beautiful, all in soft-focus full color.  However, the jokes are just not sharp or even that relevant to the picture - accompanying a picture of a perfect forty-ish housewife with pearl earrings is the caption, \\"I have PMS.  Be afraid.  Be very afraid.\\"  Unfortunately, the gags don't always even match that well with the picture, almost as if they wrote the sayings before assigning them to the ads.<br /><br />If you enjoy tepid humor about housework, chasing Mr. Right, and PMS, then you may enjoy this product.  The book is designed with a mini-easel as the back cover, allowing pages to be displayed.  I can see some women displaying the book on their desk and having it become the source of office laughs.  Really, this item is more of a gag gift or a novelty item than a book.  If taken that way, then I'll bump the rating up to 3-stars.	2005-06-11

She broadens her scope here by briefly tracing the stories of a multitude of convenience food products, from Hamburger Helper to Slim Jims to Tang.  Wyman devotes about 3 pages to each food; these synopses typically include information about the invention of the product, how it's been marketed over the years, as well as other interesting tidbits.  Some of these descriptions are quite interesting, such as the story behind the development of Swanson TV dinners.  In addition, a few recipes are also scattered throughout the book, such as Queso Dip made with Velveeta -- the kinds of recipes usually featured on the back of the box.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the tone of the book is inconsistent, veering from a tongue-in-cheek examination of cheesy food products to a seemingly sincere homage to American ingenuity.  Perhaps as a result, the humor is very uneven; the author ends up trying far too hard to be funny and falls flat.  I think part of the problem is that different audiences view these foods through their own perspectives, and Wyman seems to be trying to appeal to everyone.  Most of these products were popularized in the 1950s, so Baby Boomers will probably have a sentimental view of products such as Wonder Bread and Tater Tots; whereas younger persons are likely to find these products a bit quaint or laughable.<br /><br />The book is easy to digest for sure.  However, like a twinkie, it's insubstantial and soon forgotten.  \\"Better Than Homemade\\" goes down easily because of its format, but you shouldn't expect much.	2005-04-30

Unfortunately, I haven't had the opportunity very often to hear his readings, making me very pleased when Sedaris released this audio collection in 2003.  Recorded at Carnegie Hall in October 2002, he's in fine form.<br /><br />Most of the stories feature his family and partner (Hugh) who provide perfect fodder for his dry humor.  \\"Repeat After Me\\" is the longest and funniest section and features his sister, Lisa, and her parrot.  In this selection, Sedaris discusses the developing plans for a movie about his life; this movie has been in discussions for quite a few years and one can only hope that it will come to fruition.  Another funny story is \\"Who's the Chef,\\" which involves Sedaris' attempts to find a volunteer job in France; he ultimately works with a rubber-handed chef.<br /><br />Several of the stories have appeared elsewhere previously, such as \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\" -- a brilliant compendium of bizarre Christmas customs from around the world.  However, hearing these old stories read in Sedaris' nasal whine makes them sound fresh again.  The collection ends with Sedaris taking some questions from the audience -- the questions are rather uninteresting, but Sedaris proves his wit by handily providing impromptu laughs.  This collection doesn't give hardcore fans much new material but is still likely to please those hungry for more Sedaris.	2005-04-17

However, it's a rousing good sea-faring book.  As is true of many novels of the period, the book is told in first person narrative and almost diary form.  Arthur Gordon Pym is a young man who through a series of extraordinary events, finds himself a stowaway on a whaling ship.  However, that's just the beginning of his adventures, as he finds himself repeatedly thrust into the most unbelievable of situations.<br /><br />\\"Narrative\\" sometimes reads like a series of tall tales and requires a complete suspension of belief, but if you're able to do so, then it's a terrific story.  I read most of the novel on a long train trip and it held my attention completely.  I'm not normally a fan of \\"adventure\\" books, but \\"Narrative\\" is an exciting, brief read. Adults of all tastes are likely to enjoy this book as well as older youngsters who enjoy sea-faring stories and adventure.  Finally, the introduction, by Richard Kopley, does a great job explaining the novel's subtext, which adds greatly to the reading experience.	2005-03-19

Participating countries field a team of six students, and over the two day contest, students attempt to solve six extremely difficult math problems.  These math problems aren't your everyday geometry or algebra questions - they require a great deal of logic and creativity.  Author Steve Olson followed the 2001 contest and got to know many of the students, focusing on the U.S. team.<br /><br />To better understand these students, Olson discusses some of the qualities they possess and that are hypothesized as necessary to excel at math.  Each chapter covers a specific quality, such as 'creativity' or 'talent.'  These chapters discuss psychological and educational research about how a factor is related to math performance and how it relates to particular U.S. teammates.  Topics such as sex and ethnic differences in math abilities are also covered.  In addition, each chapter discusses one of the six math problems featured in the Olympiad - examining how a member of the U.S. team solved it.<br /><br />Of course, many people feel intimidated by math and may therefore avoid this book.  I think that one does not really need to be a math genius to appreciate what these kids do or to enjoy the book itself.  The six problems from the exam are discussed in detail in the appendix, allowing those interested to revel in the minutiae, but a deep understanding of the problems isn't needed to understand the book.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Count Down is an interesting book on an interesting topic.  However, in the end, I thought that the students and their stories were given somewhat short shrift.  I didn't really feel as though I knew the students very well, and they are certainly the most engaging aspect of the book.  In addition, the psychological and educational research that is presented is covered in a fairly cursory manner.

Homes has unveiled with great &eacute;lan the frightening underside of suburbia.  The characters run the gamut from a disappointed pedophile to a lascivious obese girl, from a responsible mother gone wild on a weekend away from her children to a teen boy who becomes strangely attracted to his sister's Barbie.  However, revealing any more about these stories would be unseemly, as the degenerate twists are part of their seductive powers.<br /><br />Despite the shocking premises, the basic situations and feelings evoked are often universal - making this book a somewhat uneasy read.  The reader does not want to identify with these characters, but Homes, with laser-like precision, forces the reader to just such apperception.

Whereas \\"Easy Riders\\" traced the rise and fall of 1970s film auteurs (Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman), \\"Down and Dirty\\" examines the next wave of potentially great filmmakers - the independents of the 1990s.  After a fallow period in films during the 1980s where bloated epics ruled the Oscars and vapid blockbusters predominated, the indies of the 1990s were welcome relief, and the story is quite interesting.<br /><br />Biskind commences his story in 1989 with \\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\\" winning awards at Sundance and Cannes film festivals.  Although a few indie movies scored some success earlier in the 1980s, \\"Sex, Lies\\" marked a turning point whereby general audiences started to take these films more seriously.  Of perhaps greater interest, Biskind argues that these indie directors are the direct descendants of the 1970s auteurs in that they also wrote and directed their films from their own personal vision, albeit on a more modest scale.  His thesis is seemingly valid and helps place the rise of indie film into historical context.  The book traces the ups and downs of a number of these directors, including Steven Soderbergh (\\"Sex, Lies\\"), Todd Haynes (\\"Safe\\"), Todd Solondz (\\"Happiness\\"), and of course wunderkind Quentin Tarantino.  Their accounts are quirky and often compelling.<br /><br />However, the book focuses primarily on two figures - Mirimax and Sundance.  Harvey and Bob Weinstein are the ostensible stars here - as they found Mirimax pictures, develop the career of Steven Soderbergh, and then make Tarantino the poster boy for indie film.  Stories abound throughout the book about their egomaniacal and allegedly assaultive behavior - from editing movies without the consent of directors (earning Harvey the nickname \\"Harvey Scissorhands\\") to intimidating distributors.  These segments are often entertaining in a voyeuristic manner, but the repetitiveness wears down the reader; reading a fraction of these episodes conveys adequately the message that the Weinsteins are bullies.  The second star of the book is Robert Redford and his Sundance Institute.  Redford is depicted as a distant despot - demanding full control of Sundance and its filmmaking processes but leaving for long periods of time to tinker endlessly on his own films.  Again, the segments about Redford become somewhat repetitive and pointless.<br /><br />All trends eventually end, and Biskind argues that the magnificent rise and fall of indie films can be attributed largely to Mirimax and Sundance.  In particular, Biskind points the finger at attempts by Mirimax to become a major studio, which left little room at the table for indie films.  Overall, Biskind makes some credible arguments, and his writing is always engaging.  Unfortunately, the Weinsteins and Redford become caricatures and the stories become a bit tiresome.  Film buffs will undoubtedly enjoy \\"Down & Dirty\\"; however, it could have used some editing - perhaps the Weinsteins could employee their infamous services here?manner, but the repetitiveness wears down the reader; reading a fraction of these episodes conveys adequately the message that the Weinsteins are bullies.

US	50754297	R23NV4LEASOXAV	0806513985	955114776	The African Cookbook	Books	3	18	18	N	Y	Outdated but Interesting	\\"The African Cookbook\\" was initially published in 1970 and represented one of the first widely available cookbooks to explore the cuisine of Africa.  Author Bea Sandler (who is now deceased) traveled extensively in Africa, and this cookbook was her attempt to introduce regional African food to America.  Chapters cover different countries, including Ethiopia, Morocco, and Senegal.  Some of the recipes are likely to be familiar to many cooks who have never before read an African cookbook (e.g., chapattis, couscous), but some are refreshingly unfamiliar.  Each chapter describes how to put together an entire meal typical of that country, which is likely to appeal to many readers.  Additionally, Sandler includes some nice anecdotes, such as the use of pieces of bread as a \\"tablecloth\\" of sorts that was common in Ethiopia.  Thus, the reader gets some idea about the country's culture (or at least the culture circa 1970).<br /><br />Although the all-meal approach is interesting and likely to appeal to many readers, it does have a drawback.  Specifically, the author seems to expect that readers will make all the recipes in a particular chapter.  The result is that many of the dishes made alone do not have much flair of Africa.  For example, I made the braised cabbage, which consisted of cabbage and onion simmered in beef broth with some crushed red peppers.  The dish was fine, but it didn't exactly sweep me away to Africa or make me feel like I was making anything unusual.  I'm sure that the dish makes more sense in the context of the full meal.<br /><br />The recipes are also presented in a confusing format - specifically, each ingredient is listed when it is to be added to the recipe.  Thus, the ingredients are scattered throughout the recipe directions, making it somewhat difficult to gather together everything you need.  The author tries to solve this problem by including a \\"shopping list\\" for each chapter, but these lists essentially include what you'd need to make every single recipe in the chapter.  In addition, as happens with some foreign cuisine cookbooks, some of the ingredients are not explained in enough detail, such as \\"salad herbs.\\"<br /><br />In sum, this cookbook is of importance due to its historical place in helping to bring African cuisine to American readers, and some of the stories are interesting.  However, some of the formatting issues and the outdated feel of the cookbook made it less than ideal for me.  Recommended with reservations.in the chapter.

In \\"Stews and Casseroles,\\" McNair does not attempt to provide full coverage of these topics.  For example, of the 27 stew recipes, none of them are the basic beef or chicken stews that most home cooks make.  Instead, the stew recipes focus primarily on ethnic (Thai Vegetable Curry, Filipino Chicken and Pork Stew) and U.S. regional (Louisiana Gumbo, California Cioppino) dishes.  Further, the dishes are not exactly easy, week-day foods.  I've made one of the stews - New Mexican Green Chile Pork Stew; the dish tasted fairly good but was relatively involved and time-consuming to prepare.  In addition, the recipe didn't call for any salt.  I usually cook with no or little salt, but the dish clearly needed some.<br /><br />Each recipe is depicted in a full-page color photo, all of which were taken by McNair.  Unfortunately, every dish is shown with the exact same granite background and white dish shown on the cover, which results in monotonous photos.  In addition, \\"Stews and Casseroles\\" was first published in 1992, and the photos have not aged particularly well.  Some of the dishes look rather unappetizing, especially the Spicy Turkey Shepherd's Pie with a mashed potato crust with white, orange, and purple stripes!  In addition, a rather large portion of the recipes contain lamb, veal, or game - which are likely to be unappealing to many readers.<br /><br />Overall, this cookbook is passable.  Based on the one recipe I've made from here, however, I don't think I'd use the cookbook again.  It's most likely to appeal to cooks who enjoy making relatively complex recipes.	2004-10-17

Much of the material is from the 1940s and 1950s, and the cookbooks clearly targeted housewives who were trying to add some zest to boring food.  Some of the pictures are truly revolting and need no comment - but author James Lileks often adds just the right jab that left me laughing out loud.<br /><br />Lileks actually started this project as a website, which grew very popular and lead to this book.  He should be commended for being generous enough to make this material available for free.  However, I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed with the book, as the website actually contains a large portion of what's here.  Despite this disappointment, the book is entertaining and certainly makes a good companion piece to the website.  The book is attractively constructed, especially considering the hideous food pictures!<br /><br />Some of his descriptions and riffs are absolutely hilarious, particularly the long piece on \\"Aunt Jenny\\" and her Spry-based baking obsession.  Of course, as with any humor, some of it misses, such as the segment on a Better Homes and Gardens BBQ cookbook.  I enjoy reading food history, and I think that others with similar interests will also like this book.  \\"The Gallery of Regrettable Food\\" would also make a nice gift for people who appreciate food humor.	2004-10-13

Often referred to as the \\"red plaid cookbook,\\" it's been released in various editions since 1930.  It covers a wide variety of food categories, techniques, and information - truly a \\"general\\" cookbook.  If you have only a few cookbooks in your home, this would be a fantastic addition to help round out your collection.<br /><br />Categories include 1) cooking basics, 2) appetizers & snacks, 3) beans, rice, & grains, 4) beverages, 5) breads, 6) cakes, 7) candies, 8) canning & freezing, 9) cookies, 10) crockery cooking, 11) desserts, 12) eggs & cheese, 13) fish & shellfish, 14) grilling, 15) meat, 16) pasta, 18) pies & tarts, 19) poultry, 20) salads & dressings, 21) sauces & relishes, 22) soups & stews, and 23) vegetables & fruit.<br /><br />Each section seeks to educate the reader, so it doesn't just contain recipes.  For example, in the \\"beans, rice, & grains\\" section, a full-color page shows what various beans, rice, and grains look like.  Throughout the section, boxes discuss topics such as buying rice, how to substitute canned beans for dried beans in recipes, and basic information pertaining to cooking times and methods.<br /><br />In addition, full nutritional information is included for each recipe: calories, fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and daily exchanges.  Although the recipes are not all low-fat or low-calorie, the reader will be able to select recipes based on the nutritional information.  Symbols also designate recipes that are \\"fast,\\" \\"low fat,\\" \\"no fat,\\" and \\"best loved.\\"  About every other page contains a full-color picture of a recipe, ingredient (e.g., types of salad greens), or technique (e.g., how to shape various kinds of rolls or trim fennel), so roughly ¼ of the recipes are shown.<br /><br />Although the recipes cover a wide-variety of foods and styles, the cookbook could be best described as general all-American.  Most of the recipes are fairly no frills, not overly exotic or spiced, and could be served to kids as well.  It's the kind of cookbook that most cooks could use, regardless of their taste and experience level.  Because it includes so much basic information, it would be a great gift for a beginning cook; however, more advanced cooks would likely appreciate many of the recipes and information as well.

The emphasis is generally on low-fat recipes with nourishing ingredients.  Not all the recipes are extremely low-calorie; however, full nutritional information is included (calories, fat, calories from fat, carbohydrates, and sodium), allowing the reader to make informed choices.<br /><br />The majority of recipes are for straight-ahead, no frills American food - the kind of fare you could easily make on a busy Tuesday night.  About half the dishes are presented in full-color pictures.  Further adding to the practicality of the cookbook is the relatively small number of ingredients required for most selections.  As is the practice with Good Housekeeping, the recipes have been tested and re-tested to ensure reliability and ease of preparation.  I've made a number of recipes from this cookbook, and I've been pleased every time.  I particularly enjoyed the \\"Rigatoni with Beef-Fennel Sauce.\\"<br /><br />In addition to the recipes, a variety of helpful special sections are scattered throughout the book, such as \\"12 low-fat veggie toppings.\\"  Also, handy suggestions for accompaniments are made for many of the recipes, which could be used to develop full meals. As a result, readers could use this practical cookbook to design healthy eating patterns and an improved lifestyle.  Highly recommended for readers who enjoy no-fuss cookbooks.	2004-09-09

Author Sylvia Lovegren discusses the trends and includes recipes from each decade. I rather enjoyed this book; however, I find myself unable to award more than 3 stars. The idea is intriguing as is much of the content, but the book is rather inconsistently developed.<br /><br /> The overarching theme of the book is (seemingly) &quot;how America cooks.&quot; However, the author swerves from highlighting absurd recipes (Banana and Popcorn Salad in the 1920's) to typical at-home foods (meatloaf in the 1980's) to haute cuisine served in fine restaurants (Ciopino in the 1970's). Covering a wide array of food trends is fine, but it feels jumbled. The formatting adds to the confusion: finding the breaks between recipes and text is very difficult ? everything simply runs together.<br /><br /> The inclusion of recipes is also somewhat haphazard and seems dictated primarily by the author?s ability to easily procure reprint permission. Thus, some of the food trends that are discussed do not include representative recipes. By and large, recipes are presented as they would have been made during the time period, with minor adjustments for out-of-date products. Nevertheless, some of the recipes are randomly updated to decrease fat and sugar content for a ?90?s taste.? That would seem to defeat the purpose of the book ? i.e., to serve as a historical document of sorts. Also, some of the recipes haven't been tested by the author ? so she recommends that they not be used.<br /><br /> Overall, the book is rather confusing because of these inconsistencies. I really wanted to like ?Fashionable Foods? more than I do. Recommended with reservations for readers looking for an entertaining read about foods, not a cookbook.	2004-07-22

Although much has been published in the area since 1997, this text continues to be worthwhile.<br /><br />The book focuses primarily on physical violence.  Issues such as basic statistics and the societal influence of family violence are explored.  One of the most interesting sections discusses the prevalence and nature of intrafamilial violence across cultures.  Child mental health professionals will likely benefit most from the sections on child victims of family violence and sibling violence; the latter of which is often ignored in books of this type.  One of the final chapters explores relevant treatment issues; however the emphasis is on legal and programmatic approaches, such as arrest of the perpetrator.  Individual treatment of persons who experience family violence are not considered in detail.<br /><br />Most of the information provided is based on hard empirical data; however, Gelles's extensive experience allows him to include rich anecdotal evidence.  As a result, the book is highly readable and provocative.  Overall, the book is remarkable -- a concise text that explores fully a multitude of issues.  The book will be most appreciated by persons in research or academics, although mental health professionals will likely find it useful as well.  Finally, the text could be ideal for use in graduate classes, with 'Discussion Questions' and 'Suggested Assignments' at the end of chapters.  Highly recommended.	2004-07-21

When the body of a young woman is found in a nearby lake, Beck is called in to assist.  The case proves frustrating, and months pass before any progress is made.  Fortunately, Beck is persistent and sticks with the case, even as it begins to haunt his life.  Originally released in 1967, the plot doesn't rely on high-tech police techniques - just good old-fashioned story-telling.<br />Married authors Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo crafted this fine novel, as well as subsequent entries in the Martin Beck series.  The style of writing is sometimes dry and always factual, which adds a great deal of realism to the story.  At times, the translation is somewhat awkward, particularly in the dialogue, but it doesn't detract much from the overall impact of the book.  Vintage Crime/ Black Lizard has re-released the series, and as always they've done a beautiful job.  Recommended for fans of police/detective stories - I intend to read more entries in the series.	2004-07-18

Many of the stories chronicle his years growing up gay in North Carolina, with his wacky family featured prominently.  Other stories are more contemporary, with glimpses of his current life in France with his boyfriend Hugh.  For his fans, Sedaris and his family have become old friends: I relish every detail that provides insight into his writing much as I savor news about people I know.<br />In addition, I was pleased by some of his stories that go a bit deeper.  Instead of relying on unusual circumstances that he has experienced, Sedaris creates some funny situations through introspection; he's clearly growing as a comic writer.  Some of his fans may worry that he will run out of childhood stories to tell - this collection suggests that he'll continue to put out great writing long after that happens.  Overall, this collection is top-notch; it's incredibly funny and has a great deal of heart.<br />Minor quibble: I was a bit disappointed that a few of the essays were familiar - many of them have been published elsewhere, such as Esquire.  However, this complaint is minor compared to the pleasure I received from reading this book.  A real winner sure to please his fans!	2004-07-18

They enter adulthood during WWII, and their lives follow tremendously different trajectories.  Sarah is the traditional one: she marries early, has three children, and settles into a seemingly idyllic life in the countryside.  Emily is more independent, and she experiences a series of unsatisfying intimate relationships and drifts through life.  The novel chiefly concerns the relationship, or lack thereof, between the sisters and their family.  The story climaxes in the 1960's with mild invocations of the women's liberation movement, and Yates draws clear parallels between the sisters and their times.  Although the time period is specific, the characters remain amazingly relatable and universal.<br />The most exceptional aspect of Yates's writing is the effortlessness with which he encapsulates life: \\"The Easter Parade\\" is a relatively short novel - yet it's remarkably complete due to Yates's talent in creating scenes that so clearly recapitulate a particular period in the sisters' lives.  Yates is best-known for his brilliant debut, \\"Revolutionary Road.\\"  His subsequent novels have received considerably less acclaim - an untenable situation considering the quality and exquisiteness of his writing.  With \\"The Easter Parade\\" the story is simple but heart-breaking; the characters are unforgettable; the final epiphany is indisputable.  Most highly recommended.	2004-07-12

Each song listing includes the artist, writer, producer, and week it hit #1.  This basic information is followed by 6 or so paragraphs telling the story behind the song.  Some of the entries focus on the artist and her/his struggle to hit it big; others talk about what inspired the writing of the song.  For example, Dolly Parton was dieting when she wrote &quot;It's All Wrong, But It's All Right&quot; while holed up in her hotel room, avoiding her crew who were eating fried clams at Howard Johnson's.  If you enjoy country music from this period, you'll find all your favorite artists here, from Merle Haggard, Tammy Wynette, and Glenn Campbell to Randy Travis, Garth Brooks, and Clint Black.  Unfortunately, the book has not been updated, so pick it up while it's still in print.	2004-07-11

This information can clearly help a college-bound student look for an academic setting that will meet her/his needs.  For example, colleges with accessible faculty (e.g., Rice &amp; Grinnell) would be perfect for students who like one-on-one attention.  On the other hand, some students might be more interested in the top party schools (e.g., Tulane &amp; Arizona State).  Other lists are just fun, such as \\"College Towns with Excellent Pop Music Scenes\\" (e.g., Seattle &amp; Austin).<br />However, one major debit exists; although some lists are clearly referenced (e.g., U.S. News's Best National Universities), others are attributed simply to \\"experts,\\" without explication of the source.  For example, the \\"Top Schools for Chemistry\\" doesn't clarify from whom or how the rankings were derived.  Whether the rankings were solicited from college administrators or experts in the field of chemistry makes a big difference.  In other words, I wouldn't simply rely on these listings to pick a school.<br />Overall, I'd recommend this book for students looking for the right college or university.  However, it shouldn't be the primary book they use.  Also add a basic college guide that includes stats about each school.	2004-07-11

Although relatively few things change on the maps, the publishers always add new features and improvements.  This year is the first time that I also purchased this Midsized edition.  At first, I was unsure whether I would use it much; however, I found that it's the perfect size to keep in the car.<br />Recently, I was traveling long-distance and missed my normal turn-off; because of the inclement weather, I was distracted and didn't notice for awhile.  Instead of being forced to turn around and backtrack, I was able to whip out my Midsized atlas and find an alternate route, all without stopping!  The size made it perfect to read at the wheel, and the maps are clear and easy to read.  It was much more manageable to read this atlas in the car than a regular atlas or road map.  From now on, I'll be purchasing the midsized edition each year alongside the regular Rand McNally atlas.	2004-07-10

It also happens to be extremely witty at times.  Chuck Klosterman is a writer for Spin magazine, so he clearly knows pop culture and can write quality essays.  The best of his work here truly encapsulates life.  Who cannot relate to this quote? - \\"Every relationship is fundamentally a power struggle, and the individual in power is whoever likes the other person less.\\"  That profundity, by the way, is from an essay that discusses the merits of \\"When Harry Met Sally\\"; another section proffers the genius of Billy Joel.  Yes, Klosterman is a bit of a hipster geek.<br />Pop culture references are sprinkled throughout the book, but sometimes it stretches a bit too much for the sake of a clever analogy.  In the forward, Klosterman assserts that, at times, he feels as though \\"everything is completely connected.\\"  Unfortunately, he is not adept enough to make all of his essays into a cohesive whole (as other reviewers have noted).  Ultimately, the book feels like a loose collection of unrelated but very funny skits.  Although that debit doesn't sink the book, it does lessen its impact.  In addition, Klosterman is sometimes too self-aware for his own good; several times, he makes reference to liking something \\"unironically\\" - such as \\"Saved by the Bell.\\"  His definitive goal seems to be achieving irony.  While this credo certainly makes \\"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs\\" a funny read, it can become rather tedious as well.  Overall, I'd recommend this book, but with reservations.	2004-07-10

Instead, it's a grammarians dream come true - an enjoyable and illuminating discussion of the history and importance of punctuation (Hmmmm, did I use that dash correctly?). Lovers of punctuation have been decrying the use of \\"netspeak\\" with no or minimal punctuation. Accordingly, Truss wrote this engaging book with the rallying cry: \\"Sticklers unite!\\" However, Truss does not simply attack the web; indeed, she asserts that text messaging and email have made reading more important than it has been of late. However, to paraphrase Bill Clinton, \\"It's the punctuation stupid!\\"<br />Truss's dry British wit (e.g., talking about wanting to marry the inventor of the colon) is used to great effect in her writing. And amusing vignettes are peppered through the text, including the introduction of the \\"interrobang\\" as well as the spread of the \\"Strukenwhite\\" virus. She even manages to make punctuation seem, well, sexy. If you've ever found yourself in a spirited debate about the Oxford comma (i.e., the second comma in the phrase \\"red, white, and blue\\"), then you'll likely enjoy this book.<br />Some reviewers have asserted that American readers may be a bit lost; however, Truss is careful about pointing out American versus British punctuation uses. I was never confused. Overall, this book is delightful - most highly recommended.	2004-07-10

A broad range of grammar topics are covered, including pronouns, punctuation, split infinitives, clich&eacute;s to avoid, easily confused words (e.g., anxious versus eager), words that are frequently misspelled, and \\"words\\" that really aren't words (e.g., irregardless).  You also will find a helpful section on email in this new expanded edition.<br />Fortunately, the guide isn't a stuffy schoolbook; it's actually pretty witty.  The most enjoyable section concerns \\"rules\\" of grammar that can be bent in all but the most formal writing, such as ending a sentence with a preposition.  In addition, examples touch upon great literature (e.g., Shakespeare) as well as popular culture (e.g., Harry Potter), making the book quite entertaining.  I actually laughed out loud several times, not something one usually does when reading about grammar!  O'Connor also strikes a good balance between being a strict grammarian and being pragmatic - she clearly understands her audience.  Some sections aren't as detailed as some readers might like, perhaps the only debit.<br />I read \\"Woe is I\\" in a few hours, and I plan on rereading it every year as a refresher.  I will keep this book by my computer - I know I'll be using it often.  Most highly recommended for writers of all types.	2004-07-09

He recently landed a university teaching job, but he's miserable.  Terrible at his job, Dixon is left wondering throughout the book whether his position will be continued.  In addition to his job woes, he seems to have great contempt for most everyone around him, including his neurotic girlfriend, Margaret.  Things worsen when he's invited for a weekend of music at a senior professor's home and he meets the professor's son - Bertrand.  A buffoonish artist, Bertrand nevertheless has an alluring girlfriend, the lovely Christine.  Dixon unsurprisingly is drawn to Christine, despite her stuffy manner and seeming arrogance.  Embarrassing Bertrand and stealing away Christine become him main priority.  In the meantime, he still needs to prepare a lecture on \\"Merrie England\\" that will be attended by his superiors and local town dignitaries.  Will he survive?<br />The novel is a model of dry British wit - at times laugh-out-loud hilarious.  Dixon is a fantastic literary character - a cynic who personifies the scorn we all feel at times.  As Amis writes about Dixon, &quot;all his faces were designed to express rage or loathing.\\"  In addition to his cynicism, Dixon is incredibly irresponsible and engages in all sorts of mischievousness, resulting in hilarious predicaments.  Nevertheless, you cannot help but root for him to succeed.<br />The writing is spectacular - each scene bristles with detail and nuance.  In particular, Amis beautifully portrays difficult interpersonal situations frankly and accurately, replete with requisite humor.  Although the book drags at times, it's a first-rate read.  Most highly recommended, particularly for readers who enjoy novels set in academia.	2004-07-09

The remainder of the book consists of salad, bread, and salad dressing recipes.<br />The soup recipes that are included, though, are fairly good although basic, including Italian Minestrone, lentil soup, beef stew.  In addition, extensive nutritional information is included for each.  However, the book is rather skimpy with no pictures and minimal text, barely a notch above those &quot;cookbooks&quot; you can purchase in the grocery store check-out line. Unfortunately, \\"Savory Soups and Salads\\" is my first major disappointment from this site.	2004-06-25

The book is targeted mostly toward primary educators, and (despite the title) others will probably find it of limited use.  I'm in psychology higher education, although I did find a few useful tips.  Primarily, however, the book serves as a basic primer for seeking internet information.  The first chapter talks about websites and search engines (oddly, it does not include google).  Subsequent chapters discuss in more detail some education-specific sites.  In reading this book, I was hoping to find some new and &quot;secret&quot; information imparted; instead, it directs the user to fairly well-known sites.<br />If you haven't used the web much, then this book will probably be somewhat useful (I'd bump it up a star for these users).  However, persons who are already web-savvy will likely find little new information here.	2004-06-07

As such, the 5th edition of &quot;Billboard Top Country&quot; is a welcome addition to the library of any country music fan.  This reference book lists alphabetically all artists who have hit the country charts from 1944 to early 2002 - from Jerry Abbott to Gayle Zeiler.  For each artist, basic biographical information is cataloged.  In addition, all their charted hits are listed in chronological order along with peak country position, weeks on the chart, and the peak pop position (if it charted).  The formatting is immaculate, and the text is easy to read despite the incredible amount of information it packs into its 591 pages.  <br />Several informative sections make up the remainder of this book.  A comprehensive Song Title section includes all charted songs listed in alphabetical order, including remakes.  The Top Artists section lists the 400 top country artists (1944-2002) and top artists by decade.  In addition, artist achievements are described, such as the artists with the most top 40 hits, most #1 hits, and streaks of hits.  Next, a Chart Facts and Feats section lists the top country records of all time and by decade, as well as winners of the major categories of the Country Music Association (CMA) Awards and inductees in the Country Music Hall of Fame.  Finally, all #1 hits are listed by year  from Pistol Packin Mama by Bing Crosby &amp; the Andrews Sisters (1944) to Im Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin Song) by Brad Paisley (2002).<br />This informative book contains tons of information and is a great deal of fun to peruse or to use as a reference.  I find myself unable to listen to CDs without it by my side.  Whether you like Hank Williams, Shania Twain, George Jones, or Alan Jackson  theyre included here.  Whether you want to see if George Strait ever won a CMA for best male vocalist (he has 5), what artist was the #1 in the 1950s (Webb Pierce)or who accumulated the most consecutive #1 hits (Alabama  21), youll find it all here.  Most highly recommended for country music fans.	2004-05-26

Instead, he ends up a sheriff's deputy in the small West Texas oil boom town of Big Sands.  Lord hates his job and feels cheated by life.  He grasps at one final straw - a land lease that might contain oil.  When he gets swindled by a small oil company, Lord vows to get revenge.  The plot develops from here and Lord becomes entangled with various low-lifes and swindlers as well as a potential love interest.<br />As with many Thompson novels, the plot is full of glaring holes and coincidences.  However, his protagonists are usually fairly well etched, and Lord joins the pantheon of intriguing Thompson characters.  A number of themes representative of Thompson's work are also included here, such as the main character being a law man as well as the son of a deceased doctor.  However, these themes are not used to much avail here and the plot and characters simply don't gel cohesively.  Ironically, &quot;The Transgressors&quot; was published between two of Thompson's finest novels - &quot;The Getaway&quot; and &quot;The Grifters.&quot;  If you're new to Thompson, then you should read one of these books first.	2004-05-23

The protagonist is Eddie, a piano player in a sleazy Philadelphia bar.  He comes from a family of criminals but managed to escape that life.  At one time, he was a promising classic pianist, but then he fell from grace.  Now, Eddie's brother Turley literally stumbles back into his life, bringing chaos and uncertainty.  At the same time, Eddie begins to tentatively woo a waitress at work.  The plot is full of twists, although it's a bit of a mess at times.<br />The novel was originally released in 1956 as &quot;Down There,&quot; which appropriately reflects the dilemma Eddie faces.  Specifically, the book focuses heavily on fate, which seems to be dictating that Eddie return to \\"down there\\" from whence he came.  The book's name was changed subsequently to reflect the classic 1960 movie it inspired - &quot;Shoot the Piano Player,&quot; directed by French auteur Francois Truffaut.  As with Truffaut's movie, the book's plot is secondary to character and ambience.  Instead, Goodis reflects on small moments, such as Eddie's exhilaration at standing close to the waitress in an alley as they hide from gangsters.  Indeed, the characters are well-delineated, and I found myself truly caring about them.<br />If you like Raymond Chadler, Jim Thomson or similar crime noir writers, then you'll probably enjoy this novel.  Goodis is a skillful pulp writer.  Unfortunately, most of his books have gone out of print - make sure you get this one while it's still available.	2004-03-13

Although a relatively large portion of the recipes are from India or China, recipes from around the world are well represented: Mexico, Greece, Jamaica, Cyprus, Italy, Trinidad, Japan, France, Morocco, the United States and Native America, Costa Rica, Korea, Cuba, Indonesia, Africa, and Lebanon.  Jaffrey also integrates a few recipes that she's developed herself, often borrowing from traditions of several different cultures.<br />The cookbook is divided into 6 main sections, with major ingredients organized in alphabetical order: 1) Dried Beans, Dried Peas, Lentils, and Nuts (azuki beans to urad beans); 2) Vegetables (artichokes to turnips); 3) Grains (barley to wild rice); 4) Dairy (eggs to yogurt); 5) Soups, Salads, and Drinks (cold soups to sweet soups); 6) Sauces and Added Flavorings (chutney to spice mixtures).  Each ingredient is discussed in detail as are basic cooking and preparation instructions, such as peeling daikon, sprouting mung beans, and making basic polenta.  As with all her cookbooks, Jaffrey's recipes are written clearly and easy to follow.  In addition, each recipe has an introductory paragraph, where she explains some of the ingredients, tells why she loves the recipe, gives hints about good accompanying dishes, and so forth.  Reading her recipes is like being in the kitchen with a good friend.<br />The final section is an extensive glossary that describes needed equipment and foreign ingredients.  Finally, Jaffrey includes a one-page summary of places to find unusual cooking resources.  Overall, &quot;World Vegetarian&quot; is one of the best cookbooks specializing in non-meat dishes that I've ever seen.  Although it will be most appreciated by vegetarians, this cookbook will find a welcome home with anyone looking for diverse vegetable dishes or trying to cut back on meat consumption.

Fortunately, the innovative researchers who wrote this book have developed a delinquency treatment with documented effectiveness - multisystemic treatment (MST).  This manual presents the basic tenets of MST, which consist of nine principles.  MST is a comprehensive treatment that targets not only the youth's behavior but also family and community factors.  The treatment acknowledges that adolescents with delinquency problems are affected by factors in their environments, such as delinquent peers, parents who do not monitor their behavior, or poor educational opportunities.  Thus, the treatment is usually conducted in the home and other relevant settings.<br />The goal of MST is to decrease rates of antisocial behavior and prevent the youth from being removed from the home; research has documented that MST meets these goals, as well as being a tremendously cost-effective treatment.  I have used this treatment with a number of clients with great success (I was trained by Dr. Borduin).  A prior reviewer pointed out that one should know about the authors of a psychology book before purchasing it; fortunately, the authors of this book come with excellent credentials.  Drs. Henggeler, Schoenwald, Rowland, and Cunningham are on the faculty at the Medical University of South Carolina, and Dr. Borduin is a Professor at the University of Missouri.  In addition, their research on the treatment has been published in many peer-reviewed journals, including:<br />Henggeler, et al. (1999). Home-based multisystemic therapy as an alternative to the hospitalization of youths in psychiatric crisis: Clinical outcomes. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. 38(11), 1331-1339.<br />Henggeler, et al. (1996).  Multisystemic therapy: An effective violence prevention approach for serious juvenile offenders. Journal of Adolescence, 19(1), 47-61.<br />The manual is very well-written and easy to follow; the authors use many examples to explain the treatment implementation.  Clearly this manual and MST itself have tremendous strengths.  The basic tenets and principles are likely to be useful to any child/adolescent therapist, although some office-based therapists may not be able to use a pure MST model.  A most highly recommended treatment guide.The manual is very well-written and easy to follow; the authors use many examples to explain the treatment implementation.

Countess van Limburg Stirum has written an interesting cookbook discussing the food of the Netherlands.  I'm part Dutch but know nothing about their food other than those cute windmill cookies you can buy at grocery stores.  With relatively few Dutch cookbooks available, I was eager to purchase this book.  Overall, the cookbook is interesting, and the author admirably describes the food and food-related customs of the country.  However, her writing is choppy and difficult to understand at times.  Admittedly, the writer's first language is probably not English, but the American publisher should have done more editing.  Although no photos are included of the recipes, a number of the author's hand-drawn pictures are included throughout the cookbook.  The pictures are fairly odd, portraying a rather old-fashioned Holland.  The cover, for instance, depicts people eating raw herring in a scene that could be straight out of a Rembrandt painting.<br />The recipes are intriguing but often incomplete, expecting the reader to understand Dutch ingredients and techniques without much explanation.  For example, a number of recipes call for boiled ham or beef, without any details.  A large portion of the recipes also call for eggs or seafood, so non-fans of those foods may not enjoy this book.  In sum, you'll probably really enjoy this cookbook if you're interested in learning more about Dutch food and culture.  On the other hand, actually making the recipes may be problematic, as the recipes are written somewhat poorly.	2004-01-06

Viewers of the Food Network will remember him from his show - Taste, where he glorified simple gastronomic pleasures.  Regaling viewers with the perfect tuna fish sandwich was the type of no-fuss presentations in which he excelled.  \\"It's All American Food\\" continues and builds on this excellent tradition.  Specifically, Rosengarten makes a compelling argument for the uniqueness and importance of American food; the cookbook is a love note to America and her food.  Don't feel inferior to the French and their fancy sauces, he seems to implore of the reader.  But what about the recipes?  Well, the cookbook is chockablock with over 400, divided into three main sections.<br /><br />In Part 1, Rosengarten considers different ethnic-American cuisines.  For example, he discusses how immigrants adapted the recipes from the old country to use the ingredients and techniques available in America.  He focuses on how the American tradition gradually shaped the original recipes.  So the Italian pasta sauce recipe isn't a trendy Southern Italian concoction with pine nuts and capers, but \\"Classic Brooklyn-Italian Meat Sauce.\\"  In other words, it's the kind of Italian food that your mother fixed or that you eat at the cheap bistro in the strip mall down the street.  In addition to Italian-American food, sections cover Greek, Mexican, Chinese, Cuban, Moroccan, Indian, and numerous other ethnic traditions.<br /><br />In Part 2, Rosengarten ponders regional American food.  Moving westward from New England, he covers numerous American food traditions, including Pennsylvania Dutch, Cajun, Southwest, and Hawaiian.  Some of the sections include only a couple of recipes but enough to provide the reader with an idea of the region and its food.  In section 3, Rosengarten discusses a variety of classic American dishes that can't be categorized into ethnic or regional foods, such as meatloaf, cole slaw, and macaroni and cheese.  All the comfort foods you ate and loved as a child and continue to crave are in this section.<br /><br />With the proliferation of cookbooks in the last decade, a cookbook has to be truly original to stand out in the crowd.  This cookbook is one of those rare finds to be treasured.  \\"It's All American\\" should be savored like a good novel, not just stuck on a dusty shelf and pulled down to make an occasional recipe.

The 2004 edition includes over 18,000 movies, 300+ more than the prior edition.  Each review details the year of release, length, director, stars, brief plot description and critique, and other pertinent information.  Maltin also rates each movie from Bomb to 4 stars.  In addition, many of the biggest movie stars and their movies are listed in an appendix.<br />The guide is simply the most comprehensive of the major movie guides.  However, some readers may be disappointed by the brevity of each entry; the guide is designed to provide basic movie information, not an in-depth analysis.  If you're looking for that kind of guide, then check out the work of Roger Ebert or Pauline Kael.  The only quibble I have is that Maltin and his editors tend to have rather conservative tastes, so I often disagree with their ratings for more cutting-edge films.<br />If you don't have an earlier edition, then I highly suggest you purchase this guide.  If you have an earlier edition, then you'll likely be pleased with a new addition - a list of 50 overlooked movie gems recommended by Maltin.  Most highly recommended.	2004-01-04

Best known for its tobacco and furniture, the area often gets ignored by tourists.  However, as this guide illustrates beautifully, the Triad is brimming with fantastic trails and hiking areas.<br />The book details information on numerous outdoor areas in the Triad.  The book claims to include 140 trails, but this total clearly encompasses multiple trails in each area.  For example, the Densons Creek Nature Trail map shows a &quot;long loop&quot; and a &quot;short loop.\\"  Nevertheless, this guide is the most complete of its type available.<br />Each hiking area is illustrated in maps featuring the various trails, with numerous pictures throughout the book.  De Hart has written brief descriptions of each area, including information regarding the length and difficulty of the hike.  The book also contains an Appendix with useful contacts, such as local biking clubs.<br />This guide will obviously appeal greatly to hikers in the Triad.  I purchased this book when I moved to the Triad, and I've used it quite often to find new places to walk and hike.  The guide could also be useful for people visiting the area and wanting information.  Highly recommended.	2004-01-03

Have you consulted your thesaurus and found nothing that matched?  If so, this clever thesaurus of phrases is for you.<br />Some of the thesaurus phrases are fairly technical or formal; for example, Einstein's Theory of Relativity can also be described as the &quot;principle of equivalence&quot; and Darwin's natural selection can be called the &quot;law of the jungle.&quot;  However, most of the phrases are more colloquial in nature; for example, look up &quot;down-and-out&quot; and you'll find clever substitutes, such as &quot;in the poorhouse&quot; and &quot;on the skids.&quot;  In addition, a short \\"phrase maker\\" section is included at the end of the thesaurus, which provides words that can be paired together.  For example, look up \\"information\\" and the phrase maker suggests \\"confidential\\" or \\"classified\\" as modifiers.<br />This thesaurus is likely to be useful for most any writer, whether your writing is creative or more technical.  The only debit is that phrases are not cross-listed, so &quot;in the poorhouse&quot; is not an entry; one has to divine the correct listing for the book to be useful.  This problem, however, is a minor inconvenience compared to the likely use writers of all sorts will derive.  Highly recommended.	2004-01-03

From the outside, such contests seem rather boring, with middle-aged housewives preparing grandma's handed-down recipes.  However, much more is percolating under the surface!<br />Sutherland traveled around the country for over a year, attending cook offs and interviewing numerous contestants to write her book.  She covers many of the biggest contests, such as the Pillsbury Bake-Off, as well as smaller ones, including State Fairs and chili cook offs.  These cook offs, some of which have been around for decades, have become big business with huge purses and prizes, leading to increased drama.  Sutherland details the cooking disasters, failed recipes, and occasional squabbles.  Sutherland also paints a vibrant portrait of the cook-off regulars, who calls themselves &quot;contesters.&quot;  These contesters enter numerous cook offs, make many of the finals, and are absorbing to read about.<br />At the end of most chapters, she includes winning recipes from the contests she discusses - so don't flip ahead or the suspense will be ruined!

The book is well-organized and gestures are divided into common-sense categories: arrival (handshake), departure (waving), approval (high five), disapproval (finger wag), mating (hair flip), offensive and profane (chin flick), just for emphasis (finger snap), and &quot;no words needed&quot; (crossing fingers).<br />Although most of the gestures are likely to be familiar to most people, some obscure gestures are included as well (e.g., the fig).  In addition to this basic information, the authors provide interesting facts about the origins and variations of gestures.  For example, making a &quot;W&quot; with your finger to mean &quot;whatever&quot; was popularized by the 1995 movie, &quot;Clueless.&quot;  Likewise, they note that the thumbing of the nose has more names than any other gesture, including &quot;pull a snook,&quot; &quot;japenese fan,&quot; and &quot;pull bacon.&quot;<br />The authors also discuss the meanings of the gestures in various cultures.  For example, in parts of Greece, nodding means &quot;no&quot; and shaking the head means &quot;yes.&quot;  Likewise, making horns with you hand can mean that your a rock fan in the U.S., or signify a cuckold in Mediterranean countries!<br />Fortunately, the authors approach the subject firmly tongue-in-cheek, and I found myself laughing frequently.  Each gesture is also illustrated with a color plate, some of which are hilarious, especially the profane ones that are illustrated by an older woman!  A terrific, well-researched little book that is most highly recommended.	2003-12-19

Allie is a husband and father of four, but he seems to care far more about his &quot;inventions&quot; and radical social ideas than he does about their welfare.  To act out his ideals, he moves his family to Central America to start a utopian society, unencumbered by traditional materialism.  Some of his contraptions work and the community begins to flourish, until his plans become grandiose.  Although the reader can see the tragedy that is to come, Theroux constructs an intriguing plot that keeps the reader drawn into the novel.<br />Some readers may be greatly off-put by Allie and his behavior; however, he is undeniably a magnetic and fascinating force.  Fortunately, the book is narrated from the point-of-view of the teenaged son, Charlie, which allows the reader some distance from the sometimes repugnant Allie.  Other readers may be disappointed by Allie's wife.  She plays a relatively small role in the proceedings, and she seems to blindly go along with Allie, even when she suspects detrimental effects on her family.  However, a man like Allie probably would be married to such a woman, as he likes to be in charge and assert himself on others strongly.<br />Overall, the Mosquito Coast is a one-of-a-kind literary experience, with a fantastic main character embedded in a rollicking-good story.

Cassidy has managed to gain the acquaintance of a legendary French painter, Jacques Debierue, who is so reclusive that his work hasn't been seen in decades.  Interviewing Debierue would be a major, career-defining coup for Figueras, and he's prepared to do anything to get the information from Cassidy.  However, when he hears Cassidy's proposal, Figueras has his doubts....<br />Many of Charles Williford's novels have gone out of print, which is unfortunate as his writing stands with the best noir writers.  The Burnt Orange Heresy is a mean read, with shocks and twists galore.  Some of the plot seems a bit far-fetched, but Williford writes so skillfully that the book withstands this flaw beautifully.  Williford also has a real eye for detail and takes great advantage of the Miami and Florida settings.  Overall, I highly recommended this novel, especially for fans of noir writers (e.g., Chandler, Jim Thompson).	2003-10-14

Published in 1958, the novel takes place in the near-future and chronicles the struggle between the elderly \\"inmates\\" of the poorhouse and the new director, Connors.  Connor is a relatively young man, and he's hated by the poorhouse residents, especially when compared to the previous director, the loveable Mendellsohn.  This hatred seems to stem from mutual distrust and miscommunication.<br />The action takes place on the day of the annual fair, when the residents sell crafts and other goods to the local townspeople.  The fair has always been the residents favorite day, although a burden they simultaneously resent.  When the fair goes less then well, the residents revolt, albeit in rather passive ways, against their new leader, further delineating the lines between them.<br />Updike's greatest asset as a writer has always been his love of language and that gift is present even here, his first novel.  Unfortunately, the novel lacks the stronger narrative drive he subsequently developed in novels such as the Rabbit series.  At times, the novel is confusing and almost free-form in nature.  This situation is particularly pronounced in the final third, when the townspeople converge on the poorhouse, introducing a multitude of new characters and stories.<br />Although brilliantly written, the novel is sluggish at times.  At less than 200 pages, it nevertheless took me a relatively long time to struggle through.  In the end, I appreciated many qualities of the book, but frankly I didn't really enjoy it.  Recommended primarily for Updike completists.	2003-08-03
US	50754297	R15YTP8YRLW7W	0312272057	433455404	Dry: A Memoir	Books	5	173	184	N	N	Another Great Memoir from Burroughs	Augusten Burroughs' last book (RUNNING WITH SCISSORS) chronicled his bizarre childhood, including his dysfunctional family, the even more dysfunctional family he lived with when his mother had a series of nervous breakdowns, and his relationship with a pedophile.  DRY: A MEMOIR picks up about 10 years later; Burroughs has a successful career in New York advertising and is a raging alcoholic.  He's in denial about his problem, so he's surprised when his co-workers stage an intervention and even more surprised when he reluctantly agrees to a 30-day rehab stint.  The book follows his attempts to remain sober, deal with his past, and cope with some harmful romantic relationships.<br />The book often skewers the mental health system, replete with therapy-speak, AA meetings, and self-help lingo, However, Burroughs adopts a fairly benign, almost affectionate, tone toward mental health workers.  Ultimately, DRY is filled with the kind of wit and attitude you've come to expect from Burroughs.  I laughed out loud quite a few times, and I felt some real suspense reading to see whether he'd relapse.<br />Burroughs is quickly establishing himself as a quirky and talented writer.  Although he may be pegged by some as a \\"gay author,\\" his work is pretty universal and likely to appeal to many different audiences.  I most highly recommend this book, and I look forward to reading more of his work.	2003-07-27

Phyllis isn't the most attractive woman, but she's a true seductress.  Huff immediately knows that Phyllis will be trouble, but he can't resist her, and she quickly involves him in a plot to kill her husband.  Things become even more complicated when Phyllis' step-daughter, Lola, enters the scene and bonds with Huff.<br />James M. Cain is one of the indisputable greats of crime noir novels, and he also wrote the terrific \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice.\\"  The plot is fast-moving, and I love Cain's stattaco writing style.  He also includes so much great detail, such as the \\"blood red curtains\\" in Phyllis' living room.  Further, Cain makes the action very believable and doesn't overlook any plot holes, which is not always the case in this genre.  I really liked this book.<br />Having said that, I think that the movie (1944, directed by the peerless Billy Wilder) is even better than the book.  I know that's blasphemous, but the movie is one of the all-time great American movies.  Read the book and don't miss the movie either!	2003-07-22

As always, Updike has produced a book of high quality.  Each month is represented in a four- or five-stanza poem and has two illustrations.  What I like about Updike is his obvious love of language, and he doesn't disappoint here.  My favorite line is for July, \\"And Tabby dozes/in a pool/ of fur she sheds/ to keep her cool.\\"  What a beautiful summation of July!<br />Originally written in 1965, the book was re-released in 1999 with new illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman.  The pictures are stunning and capture the elements of each month.  Readers of Updike know that he lives in Massachusetts, and the poems and illustrations have a decidely northeastern feel.  Most highly recommended for young readers (ages 4-8 years) as well as their parents who enjoy evocative poetry!	2003-07-21

He gets in trouble and is sent to a mysterious camp for delinquents.  He soon meets the other inmates, a strange group of boys who call each other by even stranger nicknames, and they soon dub Stanley as \\"Caveman.\\"  As part of their punishment, the boys have to dig large holes in the desert.  The Warden and other adults say that digging the holes will help build their character, but it soon becomes apparent that there are more nefarious reasons for the holes.<br />\\"Holes\\" is a great combination of mystery and humor, which is dark and off-beat.  Louis Sachar very skillfully pulls together all the bits and pieces for a great resolution.  The book also has good messages about finding a place to fit in and being yourself.  A terrific read for youngsters or adults, especially if you enjoy the Harry Potter or Series of Unfortunate Events books.  I haven't seen the movie but am looking forward to checking it out on DVD.  Highly recommended!!	2003-07-19

That is, a group of strangers assembles in a house to study ghostly phenomena.  However, this book is much deeper and therefore much more disturbing.  The main character is Eleanor Vance, a lonely and dispirited young woman who has never really done much in her life.  She jumps at the chance to go to Hill House, and inevitably, she begins to fall under it's spell.  The ways in which the house affects her are rather hearbreaking, while also being fairly creepy and scary.  Some fans of modern scary stories may be a bit offput by the dialogue - the characters sound like they're from a 50s sitcom.  However, it really is a terrific book, and the oppressed 50s style just adds to its claustrophobic feeling.<br />This novel is the first I've read from Jackson (aside from her famous short-story \\"The Lottery\\"), and I look forward to reading more.  Highly recommended for fans of psychologically complex ghost stories.	2003-07-08

REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is as well written and intriguing a book as you're ever likely to read - a true modern classic.  The plot concerns the increasingly unhappy marriage between surbanites Frank and April Wheeler.  Many other authors have explored similar territory, notably John Updike (e.g., \\"Couples\\").  However, no one has done so with such deft and beautiful writing.  The plot is ultimately somewhat incidental, and you'll likely figure out the resolution quite early.  However, the brilliantly realized characters, including friends and neighbors of the Wheelers, make the book so worthwhile.<br /><br />The meaning of the book is likely to vary for different readers; for example, many people may see a scathing yet subtle indictment of suburban life and values.  However, I read it more as as screed against the dangers of being unnecessarily dissatisfied with your life, particularly expecting brilliance where none exists.  Whatever meaning you attribute to the novel, it's extraordinary.  Most highly recommended!!!	2003-06-28
US	50754297	R30CLXB20NOTFJ	0679733159	488881438	Cropper's Cabin	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Decent Thompson Novel	CROPPER'S CABIN concerns Tom Carver, the adopted son of a poor sharecropper in Oklahoma.  Tom gets involved with the wealthy daughter of a neighboring American Indian.  When the father ends up dead, Tom becomes the prime suspect.  How will Tom get himself out of this predicament?  The book has it's share of twists and turns, some of which are not entirely believable.<br />I'm a huge fan of the writings of Jim Thompson.  CROPPER'S CABIN is clearly not one of his best offerings; Thompson's novels fall into several strata.  If you've never read one of his books, start with one of his acknowledged crime noir masterpieces, such as THE GRIFTERS, THE GETAWAY, or POP. 1280.  This novel is more for completists, although it has it's own kicky appeal.	2003-06-28

The CARNIVOROUS CARNIVAL is another terrific entry - much better than #8 in the series (\\"The Hostile Hospital\\").  This time around, the Beaudelaires are chasing Count Olaf in order to get information about VFD and the potential whereabouts of their parents.  They disguise themselves to hide from Count Olaf and his troup.  It's a great twist in the series, although I really liked the early entries where the family was sent to live with a different foster parent each time.  Overall, however, this book is another great entry in a series of excellent books.  Highly recommended for young readers as well as adults who enjoy well-written, darkly humorous books.	2003-06-28

Garner has spent many years sampling and reviewing NC BBQ, and he really seems to know what he's talking about in his reviews.  He's picked the 100 best BBQ joints in NC and gives a wealth of info about each, including address, phone number, hours, menu items, etc.  Of course, he spends the most time talking about the BBQ.<br />The intro contains a concise history of NC BBQ, including a pretty thorough discourse on the differences between Eastern Carolina BBQ and Piedmont BBQ.  I'm a newcomer to NC BBQ, which usually consists of smoked pork with a vinegar-based sauce, so this background info is helpful.  Most of the places he reviews are well-known locally and are pretty casual, preferring to put their emphasis on the BBQ instead of the atmosphere.  A terrific guide and an enjoyable read.  Highly recommended for NC residents and fans of BBQ.	2003-06-14

The plot centers on a number of characters a small resort town.  Luanne Devore is the town gossip and has alienated/angered most of her neighbors.  She becomes convinced that someone is going to murder her.  Will she be murdered?  And if so, who will do it?  Each chapter is told from the view point of a different character, and the story-telling style varies accordingly.  As a result, some of the chapters are better written and more interesting than others.  The book packs in a remarkable number of well-developed characters and side stories.  Although the story of Luanne is central, I found myself caught up in the other stories as well.  Unfortunately, the ending seems a bit rushed, and the resolution is not entirely satisfactory.<br />I've read about 16 Thompson novels, and THE KILL-OFF is one of the most enjoyable I've read.  It's not as carefully crafted and plotted as his best works, but I still really liked it a great deal.  Highly recommended.	2003-06-06

A number of these suggestions overlap, but I was impressed by the thoroughness of the book.  I have high blood pressure and have been on a low-salt diet for years; however, this book alerted me to many hidden sources of sodium, such as baking soda and packaged cereals.  The book is split into sections, such as getting the salt out of cooking, finding good low-salt fast food, and low-salt sauces.  The author even points out that licking postage stamps adds sodium to your diet!  That's thoroughness!<br />The book also contains a number of low-salt recipes scattered throughout (at least 50).  In addition, Gittleman discusses the various types of salt/sodium and gives recommendations about how to avoid unnecessary processed sodium in favor of healthier (and tastier) natural salt.  The author gives numerous suggestions about low-sodium products that can be purchased in stores or on-line.  I have a number of low-salt cookbooks, but this book is the best in combining recipes with solid suggestions.  A real winner, and I look forward to using these suggestions to further reduce my sodium intake.	2003-05-23

The writing is terrific, even great at times.  I have not read MRS. DALLOWAY (I've read other Woolf writings), but I didn't have any difficulty following the writing or themes.  The book is certainly reminiscent of Woolf (imagery and stream of consciousness play a large role), but it isn't a simple copy of her style.  Unfortunately, I didn't connect emotionally with this book or the characters, which is unusual considering the issues with which it deals.  I'd recommend this book to others, but I didn't love it as I hoped I would.	2003-02-03

It's the story of Burrough's life from the age of roughly 13 to 16.  Burrough's lived a middle-classed life, but the people around him were gradually losing it.  His mother began to have \\"psychotic breaks\\" (although it sounds like she may have had bipolar disorder) and hooked up with a bizarre psychiatrist - Dr. Finch.  Soon, every aspect of their lives are touched by Dr. Finch and his equally bizarre family.  At times, the events are horrifying, such as Burrough's molestation by Dr. Finch's adopted son.  Remarkably, Burrough's manages to find the humor even in these situations.  People are likely to compare Burrough's to another gay humorist, David Sedaris; however, Burrough's stories are far darker than those of Sedaris, although both of them write great funny stories.  This book was a tremendously quick read, and I laughed out loud more than any recent book I've read.  Highly recommended on that basis, but some readers are likely to be highly offended by some of the content.	2003-01-20

The best known of these stories is probably the OLD MAID, which was made into a 1939 movie starring Bette Davis.  It chronicles the complex relationsip between cousins who join together to hide the origins of an orphan.  I also really enjoyed NEW YEAR'S DAY, which tells of a young adulturous woman and the ramificantions her actions have on her entire life.  The story reminded me a bit of THE AGE OF INNOCENCE in its heroine's sacrificing her life for the sake of appearances.  THE SPARK is also terrific, but a bit stagey.  It tells of a young man's fascination with an older successful man who is seen as a bit silly by others.  Unfortunately, the book jacket (included on this site also) gives away a bit too much.  The other story, FALSE DAWN, I found to be too predictable, and the writing was rather stilted.  FALSE DAWN is the first story in this collection; if you find yourself not enjoying this story, stick with the book...it gets better!<br />Overall, this collection is likely to please fans of Edith Wharton and people who enjoy American literature from the early 20th century.  Wharton is an superb author of the finest caliber, and I look forward to reading more of her books.	2003-01-10

The plot concerns goings-on in the fictional African empire of Azania (which is supposed to be off the coast of present day Somalia).  Civil war has just erupted, and an English educated Azanian named Seth ends up the victor.  He gets caught up with the British legation, including frivolous Basil Seal (an acquaintance of the recurring Waugh character - Lady Metroland).  Basil is made the Minister of Moderization and has Seth's constant ear.  Naturally, things spiral downward from there.  BLACK MISCHIEF starts off a bit slow, and the first 75 pages are a bit tedious and confusing.  However, things really take off afterwards.  Waugh is always funny, but this book has more laugh-out-loud moments than most of his novels.  Highly recommended for fans of Waugh and good satirical novels.	2003-01-01

The end result (his first novel) is interesting, but not entirely successful.  The novel features the travels of Will and his best friend, Hand.  Will and Hand lost their other best friend, Jack, six months earlier, and their lives have been forever changed.  Will also came into $80,000 pretty much be accident; unbeknownest to him, his picture was featured in an advertisement for which he received compensation.  Will clearly feels guilty about this money and also that he outlived his friend Jack.  His \\"solution\\" is to plan an around-the-world trip with Hand to give away money to worthy people.<br /><br />The plot sounds intriguing initially but quickly settles into a series of somewhat repetitive vignettes.  To wit, they arrive in a new country with ambitious plans, but then their plans are thwarted and they end up wasting all their time in that locale.  Consider it a kind of cross-breeding between TV's \\"Amazing Race\\" and a vague travelogue.  What saves the book is the sometimes thrilling ideas with which Eggers imbues his writing (e.g., the Jumping people, the librarian in his head); he's clearly a talented writer.  Overall, \\"You Shall Know Our Velocity\\" is a worthy read, and one that will likely leave you wondering about the potential gems with which Eggers will provide us in the future.	2002-12-25

TEXAS BY THE TAIL is not one of his best.  Some of the writing is quite good, and I liked the characters.  However, there were far too many plot holes and coincidences.  Yeah, that can be said about most of Thompson's books, but it's particularly true here.  The plot concerns Mitch Corley, a professional gambler, and his attempts to scam people in Houston.  He has a wife who won't divorce him and a girlfriend who doesn't know he's married.  Plus, he's starting to make some powerful people mad about his gambling cons.  I actually found myself rooting for Corley, but the resolution left me wondering what happened.<br />Overall, this book is second tier Thompson.  I'd recommend THE GRIFTERS or POP. 1280 instead.  However, Thompson completists likely will enjoy it more than the average reader.	2002-12-10

As with some of the other reviewers here, I pre-ordered \\"The Book of Liz\\" long before its publication, and I was somewhat surprised to see how short it is (although at that price, I shouldn't have been surprised).  However, after reading the play I was ultimately satisfied with my purchase.  \\"The Book of Liz\\" chronicles a very sweaty and naive Squeamish Sister (an obvious play on the Amish) who decides to leave her job making cheeseballs and venture out into the real world.  No, I'm not kidding!  The plot is as bizarre as you'd expect from the Sedaris siblings.<br /><br />It should be noted that the play lists Amy Sedaris as the first author, and it definitely reflects her humor more than David's humor.  It's kind of a tame variation of her show, \\"Strangers With Candy.\\"  \\"The Book of Liz\\" is different and fun, and it gave me a few chuckles.  Not bad for such a short and inexpensive tome.	2002-11-11

The protagonist is Bill \\"Dusty\\" Rhoades, a bellboy in a second-rate hotel.  Dusty is a good-looking intelligent guy.  He had to drop his plans for med school to care for his adoptive father, who lost his job in the school district for alleged Communist activities.  Dusty resents his father and misses his mother, who died a few years earlier.  Into the picture walks Marcia Hillis, the eponymous 'swell-looking babe,' who becomes a guest at the hotel.  Dusty figures that Marcia is on the make, but he can't help falling for her anyway.  Mix in a crazy mob figure (Tug Towbridge) and assorted other characters, and you have a rollicking good story.<br />Unlike many other of Thompson's protagonists (e.g., THE KILLER INSIDE ME, POP. 1280), Dusty is not crazy.  He's just a normal, but angry guy who is looking for a way out of his unpleasant life circumstances.  Of course, he does things that the average person would not do.  Making one sympathetic for such characters is one of Thompson's gifts and part of makes him such a great writer.  Highly recommended.	2002-10-27

The protagonist is a seemingly respectable, law-abiding citizen -- small-town Southern sheriff, Nick Corey. He's been pushed around by his wife, brother-in-law, and most other town folks. In the beginning it's clear that Corey has been a very passive sheriff, and his anger at being considered weak is building. The book chronicles how he slowly and dramatically strikes back. Corey's much smarter than most of the town thinks, but he's also probably delusional, which is what ultimately makes this book such a black comic gem. There are more laugh-out loud moments in this book than in most Thompson books. The plot depends on a number of coincidences and stretches of logic, but it's great fun and there are some truly great surprises along the way. Overall, I think it's one of Thompson's most enjoyable and funny books, with some memorable moments and characters.	2002-10-06

From the beginning, you can see where the book is headed, but the skill with which it's written keeps it from being a predictable read.  The herione (?) is Undine Spragg, a social climber on the order of Lily Bart.  Undine is a rather unlikeable protagonist, which leaves one's sympathies with the supporting characters, such as her first husband, Ralph Marvell.  Fortunately, the book is filled with wonderful supporting characters, and the book's point-of-view often shifts between these characters.  The ending is bittersweet, but gives one a great deal of insight into the emptiness of attaining everthying you want.  Another terrific novel from Edith Wharton!	2002-09-15

Unfortunately, it may be my least favorite so far.  The story is about Toddy Kent, a typical Thompson grifter who is working as a door-to-door gold buyer (does anyone really do this job?).  He's semi-legit now because he's working for an honest gold buyer.  However, in a typical Thompson ploy, he accidentally gets into trouble by knocking on the wrong door while trying to buy gold.  In this house, Toddy encounters a chinless man, a Hispanic woman, and a talking dog.  Yes, the dog talks.  I like some surreal writing, but the device of having the dog talk wasn't really used to much benefit here and really just undermined the action for me.  Toddy becomes entangled in various problems related to the chinless man and corrupt gold sellers.  The plot hinges on far too many coincidences for my taste, and it really was just too confusing.  Almost every other chapter ends with someone else clobbering Toddy or pulling a gun on him.  All of Thompson's skills as a crime noir writer seemed to have deserted him with this book, much like Toddy's golden gizmo.  If you're a fan of Thompson, THE GOLDEN GIZMO is a passable read.  Otherwise, I suggest Thompson classics like THE GRIFTERS or THE GETAWAY.	2002-08-22

The plot concerns the arrival in Chandrapore, India of Ms. Quested and her potential mother-in-law, Mrs. Moore.  They come to visit Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny, who is engaged to Ms. Quested.  Ms. Quested and Mrs. Moore are the typical new arrivals, and they desire to see more of the \\"real\\" India than they can see with their fellow Brits, who tend to gather in the state Club and socialize only with each other.  They become involved with Dr. Aziz, a local Indian physician, who promises to show them the famous, nearby Marabar caves.  Dr. Aziz is solicitous toward the Brits and craves their friendship, but he clearly has negative feelings toward them also.<br /><br />At the Marabar caves, an incident occurs (or does not occur) to Ms. Quested that alters all of the characters and their town inextricably.  There is a trial and a bit of a mystery, but the focus is always on the characters and their conflicts.  In particular, the tension between the English and the people of India is beautifully portrayed.  The characters are multi-dimensional, as are their motives, which makes for a fascinating read.  I found the book to be quite moving and sad - a true classic.	2002-06-21

He gets out on parole with the help of Dr. Luther, a discredited and shady psychologist who now works with local politicians.  Pat figures out pretty quickly that Dr. Luther must have had a reason for helping him, but what is it?  Pat becomes involved with a bunch of politicians, lawyers, civil servants, and (of course) women, any of whom might be double crossing him.  The action is fast and the writing is enjoyable.  As with some of his other books, a lot of the action is unbelievable, but so what?	2002-06-10

His parents are convinced that Bob didn't have anything to do with the murder, or are they?<br />A number of different people become involved in and influence the case, each with her/his own agenda, including the DA, Bob's parents, and the local media.  Chapters are told from the viewpoint of these different characters, and this technique is used quite successfully here.  The joy of this book comes not from the suspense of figuring out who committed the crime, but in seeing how the case is effected by each character.  Overall, a highly enjoyable and fascinating Thompson novel.	2002-06-05

Britt Rainstar is the protagonist.  As is typical of a Thompson character, Rainstar owes lots of money and is in lots of trouble.  Enter Manuela Aloe, a sexy and wealthy woman who takes a liking to Rainstar and hires him to write pamphlets for her company.  Aloe is tough and when she finds out that Rainstar is married, mysterious things start to happen to him, including being threatened by a man in a skeleton costume.  Is Aloe the one behind all of it?  The plot could have been quite interesting, but instead is filled with unbelievable coincidences and characters.  None of it really makes much sense and I didn't care what happened to Rainstar.  This was Thompson's last book, and was published after his death.  One can't help but wonder whether it was actually finished at the time of his death.  A real disappointment.  If you haven't read Thompson before, start with \\"The Killer In Me,\\" \\"The Grifters,\\" or any one of his other classics.	2002-05-24

This book is similar in many ways to the Ripley books - male protagonist who is an amoral American living in the European countryside and married to a European.  Sydney is an unsuccessful American mystery writer, who finds himself unhappy in his marriage.  His wife, Alicia, is a bit critical of Sydney and he finds his imagination plotting her murder.  The suspense comes from guessing whether he will end up killing her and whether he will get away with it.  The plot twists are rather clever, although very little of what happens is particularly believable and the ending is a let-down.  Despite these flaws, Highsmith's writing style is so smooth and enjoyable that I found myself liking this book a great deal.  Highly recommmended for suspense book lovers and fans of the Ripley series.	2002-04-26

It chronicles Liza, a young woman who lives in a lower class London neighborhood.  She struggles as she works in a factory and helps her alcoholic mother.  Despite the rather grim setting, the characters are suprisingly full of life and humor.  Liza is a bit of a social butterfly in the neighborhood and is well-liked until she garners the attention of a married man.  This connection grows with tragic consequences.  There is little sentimentality in the novel, and Maugham was apparently inspired by his work as a medical student in the London slums.  Overall, a quick read and a good character study of a young, head-strong woman in late 19th century London.	2002-04-20
US	50754297	R2PEE8PM7DY9NM	0316926108	605334526	Scoop	Books	5	14	16	N	N	More brilliant Waugh	Waugh is one of my favorite authors and his work is consistently funny and scathing.  Scoop is among his best novels.  It relates the story of William Boot, who is mistaken for another person and sent to the country of Ishmael by a London newspaper to cover a possible insurgence.  Waugh frequently writes about characters who accidentally bumble into situations, but this setup is one of the funniest.  Unlike most of his protoganists, William Boot actually succeeds (for the most part) and how he does so is hilarious.  As usual, Waugh has included a fool's gallery of supporting characters that add to the humor.  Highly recommended for Waugh fans.  People unfamiliar with Waugh might want to consider starting with the slightly more serious (and darker) \\"Handful of Dust.\\"	2002-04-05

The main character, Doc McGraw, is a bank robber who is sprung from jail by his wife, Carol, who may or may not have slept with a member of the pardon board.  After he's released, Doc robs a bank and he and Carol go on the run.  Everything that can go wrong does, which builds a great deal of anxiety and mistrust between Doc and Carol.  The book has some great twists and turns and a fairly surreal ending.<br />A 1972 movie was made from the book starring Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw.  That movie is pretty good, but differs vastly from the novel.  Specifically, the movie is a love-on-the-run chase movie, while the book is about the mistrust between cons.  As such, the book is much more complex and enjoyable.  Highly recommended for fans of Jim Thompson and/or crime novels.	2002-04-04

I finally got around to reading the novel and was very impressed.  The book is a very quick read, but manages to pack in a great deal of enjoyable material.  The book chronicles the story of Roy Dillon, who is a second generation grifter.  His mother is Lilly Dillon, who works for the mob, and one of the most ferocious women ever created for fiction.  Roy works the short-con, cheating businessmen and people in bars.  He meets Moira Langtry, who has a history of pulling long-term con jobs with an ex-boyfriend.  She tries to convince Roy that they should team up, with disastrous results.  The book is gritty, with vivid characters and a terrific ending.  I've read quite a few Thompson novels and this is the best.  In fact, it may be one of the best pulp novels ever written.	2002-03-31

It's a collection of mostly country style recipes that were submitted by residents of Madison County, Iowa.  Of course, the fascination with the bestselling novel \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" explains why this particular local cookbook was released nationally.  As such, the cookbook is fine, and there are a number of stories included that some people might find interesting (again submitted by local residents).<br />The main fault of the cookbook is the lack of standardization across recipes, leading to recipes that are sometimes vague.  For example, one recipe may call for \\"1 can of tomato juice,\\" but not specify what size can to use.  Many of the casserole recipes are especially vague; for example, indicating that one should \\"cook one chicken,\\" but not explaining how the chicken should be cooked.  This cookbook would probably make a nice gift for persons who like country style food and who already know quite a bit about how to cook in this manner.  Others beware.	2002-03-16

The recipes were submitted by members of the council and are terrific.  Importantly, the authors made efforts to cut out much of the fat from the recipes and did a great job.<br />I also really enjoy the stories that are interspersed throughout the book.  A number of prominent African-Americans share their memories of Dorothy Height and recount times that they shared a meal with her.  One word of caution - the recipe for Hoppin' John calls for 2 pounds of brown rice...I think this is a typo and perhaps should read 2 cups.  I ended up with a HUGE vat of rice with a few black eye peas.  Otherwise, a very fine collection!	2002-03-16
US	50754297	RYIV0QU67TXLX	0140185232	579488546	The Razor's Edge	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Thought-provoking classic	I really like Maugham's work, especially \\"The Moon and Sixpence,\\" and enjoyed this book.  The basic plot concerns a writer (Maugham himself serves as narrator) who becomes acquainted with group of wealthy Americans.  They come into and out of each others lives over a period between WWI and WWII.  One of these Americans, Larry, decides to drop out of society.  At first it is unclear why he does so, but eventually it becomes apparent that he is seeking spiritual fulfillment.  Equal parts mysticism and social comedy, the \\"Razor's Edge\\" is well-written and thought-provoking.<br />I'm not a fan of novels that deal with religion or philosophy, but I was intrigued nevertheless by \\"The Razor's Edge.\\"  It's the type of novel that sticks with you after you've read it and the characters remain vivid.  I did however, think that Larry is more of a literary device than a fully fleshed out character.  He seems to pop in at convenient times, drop some spiritual wisdom, remain mysterious, and then vanish.  Maugham also spends a disturbing amount of time describing again and again what a wonderful smile Larry has.  The use of Maugham as the narrator is also a bit suspect at times, as he frequently (and needlessly?) elaborates that he is simply relating stories that others have told to him, that he is reconstructing these tales, that he is adding details, etc. - very repetitive.  Despite these flaws, the book is a very worthwhile read, and I highly recommended it.	2002-03-14

I admire his toughness and drive, and so I immediately bought this book when it was first released.  On the positive side, I enjoyed learning more about his background and early life.  However, the writing style is quite irritating.  After putting the book aside for quite a few months, I finally forced myself to finish it.<br />I agree with much of what he has to say, but the book was simply poorly written.  He has attempted to take what works well on his TV show and transfer it directly to print.  His narrative is frequently interrupted with asides that he labels with \\"this just in\\" or other tag lines from his show.  Unfortunately, these asides interrupt the flow of and ultimately weaken his argument.  The topics he takes on and his opinions are familiar to viewers, but really don't flow together well.  He also has a rather bizarre section at the end listing Hollywood performers and movies that we really likes.  O'Reilly, you're not a movie critic, stick to what you do best: grill crooked politicians.  Also, I understand that this book primarily represents his opinions, and is not meant as an academic argument, but the lack of sources and citations is a bit problematic.  Overall, a disappointment.	2002-02-27
US	50754297	RZ81NL59N9OC	0316926116	195949365	Vile Bodies	Books	4	71	72	N	N	Typically amusing Waugh	I read my first book by Waugh a few months ago and have become a huge fan, \\"Vile Bodies\\" being the fourth Waugh book I've read.  Although not a sequel to his first novel, \\"Decline and Fall,\\" \\"Vile Bodies\\" includes several of the same characters and has a similar satiric tone.  You do not, however, have to have read \\"Decline and Fall\\" to enjoy this book.<br />The main plot concerns a group of young people from London's \\"bright young generation.\\"  They have monied parents and spend most of their time searching for the next party and amusing fad.  The protagonist is Adam Fenwick-Symes, a poor writer who manages to live the highlife by being a hanger-on.  He is in love with Nina Blount, but cannot marry her because of his economic status.  The book chronicles his attempts at making enough money to marry Nina.  As with other Waugh books, the characters are passive and do not really do anything, but they manage to have some terrible things happen to them!<br />The supporting characters are extremely funny, including the modern Agatha Runcible, the revolving line of Prime Ministers, and the various people who become the columnist Mr. Chatterbox.  Of course, as with all of the Back Bay Books editions of Waugh's books, the cover and style are lovely.  If you love Waugh, you'll love this book.  Highly recommended.	2002-02-24

The themes explored in these works of fiction are delved into further in this non-fiction work.  Specifically, McMurtry discusses growing up in rural Texas and how that influenced his work.  The main theme of the essays, not surprisingly, is the death of small town Texas as people abandoned the country for the big cities (he focuses on Dallas, Houston, and Austin).<br />Perhaps the most interesting chapter is the last one; McMurtry talks about his family, which includes several generations of Texas ranchers and cowboys.  Many of the stories he tells have made their way into his novels, so one really begins to appreciate just how autobiographical his novels are.  I also greatly enjoyed the chapter about the filming of the movie version of his novel, &quot;Horseman, Pass By&quot; (the movie is called &quot;Hud&quot; - a great classic).  Another interesting section describes McMurtry's road trip across Texas.  Less enjoyable was the chapter on Texas writers pre-1960, which focused on several non-fiction writers of whom I was unaware.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this book quite a bit and look forward to reading more of McMurtry's work.  If you like McMurtry's fiction work, then you'll also likely enjoy this short compendium.	2002-02-18

I'm a huge PSB fan, and reading this book was an excellent way to learn a little bit more about the boys.  I greatly enjoyed &quot;Literally&quot; and think that other PSB fans will also.<br />First, the book is terribly funny.  PSB act like spoiled rock stars at times and then seem like the most normal chaps you could hope to meet.  This schism is appropriate for a group that writes and performs such complex music.  We also learn a great deal about their creative process.  For example, I had always assumed that Chris wrote the music and Neil wrote the lyrics, which apparently is not the case; instead, they seem to have equal say in developing songs.  The boys also seem surprisingly principled and unwilling to bend their artistic choices for the sake of popularity and record company approval.<br />&quot;Literally&quot; covers their tour during for &quot;Introspective&quot; CD (&quot;It's Alright&quot; was released as a single in Britain during this time).  The PSB were in their self-proclaimed &quot;imperial period&quot; - when everything they did went to #1 in the UK and top 10 in the US.  However, times were clearly changing, especially with the proliferation of English boy bands during the 1990s.  Neil and Chris riff on a number of British and American pop stars, and the fun is not diminished by the fact that many of these acts, such as Bros, are fairly unknown in the US.  If anything, the fading of these untalented bands and the continuing (European) success of PSB documents that substance can win over style.<br />Although the book is a bit dated, it?s a terrific read.  Most highly recommended for PSB fans.	2002-02-17

Not much changes from year-to-year, but this edition represents a vast improvement on recent versions.  First, they changed the color scheme.  Neighboring states are now in olive green, instead of yellow as they were in recent editions.  This change helps make it more obvious where borders are and the maps are clearer than before.  In addition, national parks are now bright green, and stand out much better (in prior editions, they were outlined with pink and blended in with neighboring highways).  Of course, each year, they update the road construction areas, which I have been impressed with their accuracy.  This edition also includes a wonderful section highlighting some lesser known events and road trips around the country.  Finally, there is a useful section that includes website addresses for state tourism offices.  Even if you have a recent edition of this atlas, I highly recommend the 2002 version.  Happy travelling!	2002-02-17

Is it a Dickensian flight of fancy?  Well it's been classified as all of these things, but none of these labels is quite adequate.  It is perhaps ultimately best described as a black comedy.  The book begins with the birth of the 77th Earl of Gormenghast, a gigantic castle were ritual rules all.  Gormenghast castle seems to exist in an alternative universe to ours; however, there is no magic or cuddly hobbits, just grim realism.<br />The plot chronicles the ramifications of when the royal family and servants encounter Steerpike, a young kitchen worker who finagles his out of kitchen service (most jobs in the castle are assigned along heriditary lines).  A self-possessed rebel and clever 17-year-old, Steerpike turns their world upside down.  Steerpike is like many people you may know, manipulative, self-serving, and solicitous.  However, the royal family and servants are so exceedingly self-occupied, that they are easily tricked by this young upstart.  Steerpike may just be the most likeable villian ever; it's hard to blame him for the things he does considering the easy targets he selects.<br />The book is packed with other extremely memorable characters, including the sullen royal daughter (Fuschia), the Countess who seems to care only about her \\"pets,\\" innumerable wild birds and and white cats, and her sisters-in-law, the identical twins (Cora and Clarice) who are the primary pawns of Steerpike.  The book also provides splendid details about the castles and its world, not surprising considering that Peake is perhaps best known as an illustrator (a few of his illustrations are included here).  The writing is dense and ponderous at times, but provides so many laughs and pleasures, that it is well worth the time investment.  Of course, Titus Groan is just the first part of an epic.  I have not read the remaining two books yet, but am tremendously excited to do.  A most highly recommended read.	2002-02-16

In addition to traditional recipes for chicken noodle soup, international soups and \\"20 minute\\" soups are represented.<br /><br />However, I found the format and pictures to be a bit too precious for this male soup lover.  Although it's the recipes that ultimately matter, a cook is always influenced by cookbook aesthetics, and this one just didn't do it for me.

The 7th edition chronicles every Top 40 hit through the end of the millenium.  I'm not in the music business, but love seeing what hits each artist has had and how how they went on the chart.  This book does a great job of cross-referencing songs, so if a song is officially credited to Puff Daddy featuring Mase, then it is listed in this book under both artists.  This is incredibly helpful given the recent proliferation of guest artists on chart singles.

He chronicles the animals and people he helps as an active veternarian in Yorkshire, England.  As such, the stories are usually more about the people and their attachment to their pets and livestock than they are about the animals themselves.  Although the time period is not explicitly mentioned and he jumps around in time a great deal, this book seems to cover the period right after his preceeding book (The Lord God Made Them All), the late 50s and early 60s.  Herriot's children are now 6-10 years old and play an increasing role in his practice.  He also includes a touching series of stories about his and his wife's attempts to tame some farm cats.  Every Living Thing was Herriot's final full-length original book, and it is an excellent end to an excellent series.	2002-02-04

However, I was quite entertained and pleased with the audiobook version of &quot;On Writing,&quot; which is read by King himself.  King has obviously mastered the craft of writing solid novels that entertain many people, although by his own admission he is not the kind of author that critics love.  As such, his writing advice is workmanlike but also incredibly useful.  King intersperses his advice with illustrative vignettes from his childhood and early days as a writer.  You can really see how his interest and talent in writing developed.  Although he gives much useful basic advice about writing (e.g., avoid adverbs), perhaps the most illuminating was his description of what it takes to be a good writer ? lots of reading and lots of practice.  It's easy to see how his famous work ethic has lead to his immense productivity and success.  King breaks down the writing process in a way that inspired me to write more after listening to the audiobook.  Highly recommended.	2002-02-04

They also find themselves wanted by authorities for the murder of Jacques Snicket.  They spend the remainder of the book trying to allude the authorities and solve the ongoing mystery of Jacques Snicket and VFD.  The descriptions of the half-finished hospital where they volunteer and the over-stuffed general store are the type of classic creativity we expect from this series.  Unfortunately, the orphans are on their own this time and are not sent to live with a guardian, which detracted from the book for me.  Fortunately, Lemony Snicket has promised that there will be 13 books in this series and I am eagerly awaiting #9.	2002-02-01

The supporting characters are well-drawn as is the town, which is really the star of this book.  I found the character of Silas Marner to be vague and unbelievable.  His growing isolation is described in a fair amount of detail, but his transformation is glossed over too quickly.  It is simply not believable that someone who shuns others would be so willing to adopt a child and change so quickly.  The message that love can transform even the most hardened person is beautiful, and the ending is wonderful, but I found it difficult to make it through most of this book.	2002-02-01

However, the emphasis is NOT on rice, but on different main entrees.  Each recipe has suggestions for the rice to serve with the entree, but does not give detailed cooking directions for the rice.  A disappointment.	2002-01-25

There aren't any pictures or interetsing anecdotes, just tons of rice recipes.  The recipes are from around the world and I've made a number of them, all of which have been excellent.  Highlights include the Indian dishes, Hoppin' John, and Carolina red rice.	2002-01-25

They are grouped by month and take advantage of the fresh produce that are in season.  One of the great benefits of these recipes is that most of the ingredients are relatively inexpensive and healthy (e.g., carrots, onions, celery, beans).  The recipes vary a great deal in taste, although many have similar ingredient lists.  A great testiment to the diversity of soup.  I have, however, noticed that many of the recipes call for a rather large portion of oil and turn out somewhat greasy.  I recommend cutting the oil if it seems excessive.	2002-01-25

It contains about 50 soup recipes that show a great deal of diversity.  Each soup is paired with recipes for a salad and a bread that the author thinks will compliment the recipe well.  Along with each set of recipes is a detailed description and anecdotes.  Well written and the recipes sound great.  Only debit - no pictures.	2002-01-25

Each recipe includes a color photo.  Unfortunately, many of the recipes use ingredients that are difficult to find in the U.S. or are unappetizing to me.  In particular, there are too many fish soups.  If you love seafood soups, you may love this collection, but I was underwhelmed.	2002-01-25

The recipes are outstanding and the variety is great.  Who knew that there are so many different recipes for minestrone?  This cook book is the type I love to just pick up and read, and the author includes many warm vignettes or his family memories associated with these recipes.  Unfortunately, though, there are no pictures of these excellent soups.	2002-01-25

All the traditional favorites are here as well as updated versions of them that are simpler and use more current ingredients.  I made the Beef Burgundy for Christmas dinner and was impressed.  When you have guests coming or are cooking for a special occasion, crack open this book and find a perfect recipe.	2002-01-25

Many of the reviewers here are in high school...when I went to high school I had several friends who read this book and were equally unimpressed with it.  I read it in my late twenties and was blown away with the combination of elaborate language, complex psychological thrills, and genuine scares.  The book must have been quite shocking to its initial audience, and within this context, it still is a shocker.  Read this book and focus on the psychological aspects, and you'll likely have a good time.  Incidentally, the book was made into a brilliant movie, \\"The Innocents,\\" starring Deborah Kerr.	2002-01-24

I recommend Washington Square as a good introduction to his work.  The book is quite short, and the writing is fairly straight forward, but still complex and beautiful.  The story is a classic and has been retold in several movies, including the brilliant \\"The Heiress.\\"  The theme of a person with inner beauty, but who is physically unappealing and awkward being unappreciated by his/her parents and society is certainly relevant, and the novel's herione remains contemporary.  If you like this novel, then move on and sample some of James' more difficult work.	2002-01-24

As such, it was the perfect quick read.  Like all other good \\"vacation books,\\" after it was digested, I completely forgot everything about it.  That's exactly what you want when you're travelling!  Much of the plot is unbelievable, and the main character makes many judgment errors (e.g., repeatedly entering airplane hangars alone at night and then being chased), but the plot hums along.  A good page turner.	2002-01-24
US	50754297	R3CZSR9WYKWITQ	0671753800	72444000	Leaving Cheyenne	Books	2	4	12	N	N	Tiresome	I love several of Larry McMurtry's early novels, such as Horseman, Pass By and The Last Picture Show.  This novel is reminiscent of these great novels (all are set in Thalia, Texas), but falls short.  As usual, McMurtry depicts quite flawlessly the atmosphere of growing up in Texas.  The main character of Gideon is multi-dimensional and intriguing, but Molly and Johnny remain enigmas.  That situation makes for a long read, especially once the main point of view shifts away from Gideon in the later half of the book.  At this early point in his career, McMurtry also did not seem to understand women - seeming to view them as existing primarily to tease and please men.  The story gains momentum and the characters become richer as it prgresses, but by that point, I was just wanting to get through the book.	2002-01-22

If one does not take it at all seriously, then it is a howlingly funny book.  His \\"hero,\\" Paul Pennyfeather, and the other characters float in and out of various kinds of trouble without seeming to learn a single thing.  Best moment - the casual, but horrifying fate of poor little Lord Tangent.  The amusing illustrations drawn by Waugh himself are a delightful bonus.  I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more of Waugh.	2002-01-22

Now in my 30's, I recently picked up his fifth book.  I was struck by how these stories are ostensibly about animals, but say vastly more about their human owners and the need for companionship.  Herriot's writing style is appropriately simple and unadorned, which atcually helps increase the impact of his stories.  However, his writing can be a bit repetitive at times.  There really is not a plot, just a selection of stories from his years as a a vet and resident of a small Yorkshire town.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he jumps around in time a bit too much (from 1947 to the mid-1950s).  For example, he includes journal passages from trips he has taken as a vet escorting animals for sale to other countries.  These stories are fairly interesting, but don't really belong here and are interspersed between all the other stories, further leading to a lack of context.  Overall, a worthwhile, but flawed book that is significantly buoyed by Herriot's obvious love of animals and their owners.	2002-01-17

Although Waugh is a brit who usually writes books about the English &quot;smart set,&quot; he perfectly captures the vacuous and insidious nature of 1930's Hollywood.  The characters have little self-insight, which makes for some wickedly funny moments.	2002-01-10

The beginning is also filled with a great deal of religious rhetoric - a topic that does not interest me.  I had a difficult time maintaining interest in the first 100 pages, but warmed up to the book considerably toward the end.  The main character, the unnamed whisky priest, is initially off-putting, but by the end, I understood his actions and beliefs better.	2002-01-10

The books are perfect for adults who have already read all of the Harry Potter books and want some light, imaginative reading.  I've read the first seven books in the series, often in between more &quot;serious&quot; literature - a good way to cleanse the palate!  Highly recommended for older children to adults.	2002-01-10

The book was made into the movie &quot;Hud,&quot; starring Paul Newman and Patricia Neal.  The movie was brilliant, but different from the book in several notable ways.  The stars of this book are teenager Lonnie and the evocative Texas setting.  However, it is not simply another sensitive coming of age story.  Instead it explores such varied topics as race relations and the death of the Old West.  Look for the town and some of the same characters in McMurtry's &quot;The Last Picture Show,&quot; another beautiful novel.	2002-01-10

However, the book ultimately pales when compared to Updike and others who have written on similar topics (monogamy, death, commitment).  What sank the book for me was the character of Vicki - who was depicted in an outdated (even for 1986) and stereotyped Southern Belle manner.  Embarassing.  I intend to read &quot;Independence Day,&quot; but with reservation.	2001-12-31

As such, the \\"Member of the Wedding\\" accurately chronicles some of the painful situations that all of us experience as youg adolescents. The plot is aside the point, and the anguish of growing up is front and center.  The book is well-written and makes me want to read additional works by Ms. McCullers.	2000-03-28
