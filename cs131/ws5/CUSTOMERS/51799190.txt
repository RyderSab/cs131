This book is a lifesaver - literally. It explains in great detail how to live your life in the moment, and not waste any more time waiting &quot;until I'm thin.&quot;<br />There are chapters on why some people are born to be big genetically due to family heritage, on how culture shapes us to believe that only thin people are attractive and deserving, and on how discrimination against larger-sized people is the last acceptable form of discrimination in the United States. These chapters set the stage for what you can do to change your life and the way that you live it. Next come chapters about how to create your own ideals about body image, how to improve your self-esteem from within, and how to create your own personal style (in clothing, jewelry, etc.) There is a chapter on how to deal with people (friends, family and strangers) who seem to think that you don't know you are large, and feel the need to comment on your size to you or behind your back. (I found this chapter particularly helpful, as it gave good advice on how to confront people about their behavior without being cruel and with an eye on educating.) The book finishes up with chapters on finding ways to move that please you and your body, and describing the &quot;size acceptance movement&quot; that is sweeping the country. At the end is a resource for finding plus-sized clothing, health information and psychological support.<br />I got this book from the library and intend to buy several copies for myself and friends. I have read many many books on this and similar topics, and I feel that this one is the best of the bunch. Just reading it made me feel strong, confident, and better about myself. I know I'm going to need to keep reading it for some time to come before I gain a better self-esteem for good, but I'm looking forward to it! I recommend this book highly to anyone who is dealing with esteem issues because of their size.	2001-08-06

Once I started paying attention, I discovered that this game is anything but simple - in fact, it is very complex and there are rules to cover almost every situation.<br />Bakalar discusses the rules, the players, the strategies, and even has a section on the managers, omners, coaches and umpires. He has a chapter at the end on how to talk like true baseball fan. I found this book very helpful in understanding baseball. I think that even a long-time fan would enjoy reading this book. It would also make an excellent gift for a baseball fan (though not for very young fans, as it is too complicated for a younger reader.)	2001-06-15

The watercolor paintings are colorful without being brash, and the child and animals are all realistic and yet stylized at the same time. I love how the child is not defined by the story as being a boy or a girl, and that it looks ambiguous enough to be either. <br />The repetition of the story makes it easy to read and easy for an older child to learn, and yet isn't the kind of repetition that drives parents wild. As the child gets older, you can drop words and let them &quot;fill in the blank&quot; as they look at the pictures to identify both the animals and the animals' colors. <br />When I was a Nanny my charge and I adored this book and read it at least a hundred times. Now that I am home with my own son, I bought the book for him and he loves it too!	2001-06-15

I honestly believe that this is one of the best parenting books in existence. It gives more information than anyone can absorb in a single reading, and all of it is important. There isn't anything about this book that I dislike. I had the extreme pleasure of meeting Ms. Granju at a conference, and she was just as wonderful as her book.<br />The book starts out with a chapter explaining what attachment parenting is: Bonding with your baby, breastfeeding, responding to your baby's cues, sleeping with and carrying your baby, and respecting your baby as an individual. There is a chapter on preparing for your baby's arrival - what items you will really need, which ones you can probably live without, and planning to breastfeed. There are also chapters on why you should choose breastfeeding over bottle-feeding, all of the reasons why breastfeeding is so important, how and why you should consider sleeping with your baby, &quot;The Working Parent's Guide to Attachment Parenting&quot;, why you should carry your baby, and much much more. <br />Each chapter of this book includes a section with resources - other books you can read, organizations you can contact, and websites and mailing lists you can join. I found these resources very helpful and wish all books were so complete. Granju includes quotes from real families who AP, comparisons of parenting styles in different cultures, and lots of supporting medical references. <br />This book is worth every penny and makes a great gift for new or expecting parents.	2001-06-15

Anyone who thinks that they have even a slightly unhealthy relationship with food needs to read this book. The author really knows what she's talking about, and she knows how to explain her theories so that anyone can understand them. Essentially, she believes that eating disorders do not have an emotional root, but rather that they are caused by dieting. When you go on a diet, your body knows that calories are severely limited, and goes into &quot;starvation mode&quot; - it slows down your metabolism to preserve calories. Then, when you have lost weight and begin to eat normally again, your metabolism is very slow so you gain the weight back quickly. There is also an explanation for why people who are dieting crave fatty, sugary foods - their bodies are trying to save them from what is seen only as a famine.<br />There are sections that describe how to rescue yourself from this &quot;food jail&quot; - you must eat often, whenever you are hungry, until you are no longer hungry. You must understand that initially this will probably cause weight gain, and you must trust that eventually your body will adjust and believe that there won't be any more famines, and then you will lose weight naturally, without trying. There is also a great section on feeling better about yourself - it suggests looking at art by artists like Renior, throwing away your scale, ignoring the sizes of your clothing, and appreciating the things that your body can do, regardless of any extra pounds you may be carrying.<br />The focus is on eating healthy, whole foods when you are hungry, and stopping when you are full. It's so simple, but people with a history of eating disorders need to have it spelled out for them, and this book does that remarkably well. Reading this allowed me to start along the road to recovery from a lifetime of eating disorders, and the weight that I gained allowed me to conceive my son. I recommend this book highly!	2001-02-14

It focuses more on how to &quot;be lazy&quot; and less on what to actually feed your children.      The author recommends that to &quot;save time&quot; you do things like prepare your ingredients in advance and cut up veggies for snacks when you first get home from the grocery store. Obviously, these methods don't actually save any time - they just alter when you expend your time. There are also strange little charts at the end of each chapter that supposedly demonstrate how you can now save time - but they are difficult to understand and seem like wasted space. Many of the time-saving hints are also money-wasting ones.    There are not a lot of recipes in this book. Some of them do not sound appealing. Many of the recipes contain dairy products in some form - cheese, cream, cottage cheese, etc.     I was not impressed by this book.	2001-02-14

I originally borrowed it from the library and decided right away that I wanted my own copy. It explains how to alter your diet from a typical high-fat American diet to a lower-fat, healthy one without a mutiny from your family.<br />It was eye-opening to learn how to read nutrition labels on packaged foods so that I really understood how much fat was in the things I was eating. It was also immensely helpful to see WHY certain ingredients (like hydrogenated oils) are bad for you. There are lots of great recipes in this book, and also demonstrations of how you can change recipes you are already using so that they will be lower in fat. There's plenty of info on what kinds of healthy, low-fat foods you can feed your children for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, and on how you can still eat out without consuming tons of saturated fats.<br />The only thing I found frustrating about this book was the focus on replacing high-fat dairy products with other dairy prodcuts. As someone who is allergic to all dairy, I would hope for some suggestions of non-dairy ingredients with which to replace cheeses and cream, especially since dairy products are so laden with saturated fats. Otherwise, I found this to be a very helpful book.	2001-02-14

It is NOT the best choice for the already-alternative parent.<br />This book has a very well written section on feeding your family healthy, organic foods. It explains why organic is better, offers alternatives for buying organic and whole foods less expensively, and has good nutrition information. It also has interesting sections on what you should allow your children to view on TV and in movies, educating your children, and earth conservation.<br />Strangely, although this book seems to want to be a guide for the &quot;natural&quot; family, it has sections emphasizing the benefits and importance of vaccinations. It also extols the religious virtues of circumcision. I found these two viewpoints in opposition to the rest of the book. There isn't even the slightest hint of suggestion that there ARE reasons to be concerned about vaccinations.<br />I was disappointed that this book wasn't all that I wanted it to be. For families who find themselves in the space between &quot;Mainstream&quot; and &quot;Alternative&quot;, it might be a very good option. It would probably be valuable to demonstrate to mainstream family members that some of your beliefs aren't completely &quot;out there.&quot;	2001-01-11

There are helpful diagrams and charts that illustrate the points the author is making.<br />This book is for women who want to better understand their fertility, avoid or achieve conception, eliminate use of the pill or other chemical forms of birth control, and attempt to conceive a baby of one sex or the other. It explains how you can use your basal body temperature (taken before rising first thing in the morning) and your cervical mucous to tell whether you are fertile or not. This allows you to avoid intercourse if you are trying to avoid pregnancy, and to have intercourse at your most fertile times if you are trying to get pregnant.<br />I think that even women who want to remain on birth control should read this book - it is valuable to understand how your body works and why. For women who are breastfeeding, this book has a whole chapter on using your temp and mucous to ascertain whether your fertility has returned - an excellent tool since chemical birth control while breastfeeding is best avoided. For women who are experiencing infertility, charting your temps and mucous can help you discover why you aren't conceiving, and knowing this can make it easier to seek treatment.<br />There may be more thorough books on this topic out there, but I think this is one of the best basic ones. I recommend it highly.	2001-01-11

It includes everything from more conventional treatments for illnesses to less conventional methods such as dietary changes and homeopathy.<br />This book is also a great reference for parents who are unfamiliar with less conventional treatments - it gives helpful descriptions of what homeopathy and other natural methods actually are, the principles for treatment they use, and why these methods work. It is written in an easy-to-use format and really opened my eyes to alternative methods of helping my child stay healthy.<br />The only thing I feel should be omitted from this book is the section on time-outs - I didn't buy a health book for it's parenting method, and would prefer not to be given parenting suggestions from this author. Otherwise, it's a great book.	2001-01-06

If it has ever even occured to you that the medical system is not infallible, this book will open your eyes to a reality that most people would prefer to ignore. Vaccinations DO cause temporary and permanent damage to children every year in this country, and many of the diseases against which we are vaccinated are not as frightening as the damage caused by the vaccinations themselves.<br />This book focuses solely on the DTaP vaccination. There are many case histories of children who were permanently brain damaged and even killed by this vaccination. In some cases more than one child in a family has been permanently injured. In others parents have had to fight in court to retain custody of their younger children when they refused to vaccinate them following severe reactions in their older children.<br />The companies that manufacture vaccinations are making millions of dollars per year. When a child has a permanently debilitating reaction to a vaccine, the manufacturer is not even held financially responsible - the government uses our tax dollars to compensate families through an official program called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Would this program even exist if it weren't obvious that vaccines DO cause damage in some instances?<br />This book gives great information about the kinds of children who are more likely to react to vaccinations, including those who were born prematurely or with a low birth weight, those from families with allergies and food sensitivities, and those who had family members experience vaccine reactions. It also describes in great detail the kinds of reactions one can expect from vaccinations - and which ones should not be considered &quot;normal&quot; despite what your pediatrician's office may tell you. If your child has received some vaccinations already and you feel uncomfortable about any symptoms he or she exhibited in the days following, READ THIS BOOK before you allow any further vaccinations. MANY children who were eventually permanently injured exhibited reactions to earlier vaccinations that were ignored or considered unimportant until hindsight provided the obvious answer.	2001-01-06

Along with Attachment Parenting, this is one of the first books I recommend to new and soon-to-be parents. It suggests a child-friendly method of raising your baby, a method that is respectful of a baby's needs.<br />There is an excellent section on the first days at home that will answer almost every question a new parent might have - how to know if your baby is getting enough to eat, what all those weird marks and blemishes on baby's skin are, and how much you should expect baby to sleep. One of the best things about this book is that it focuses on the range of normal behavior, rather than on a specific expectation. For example, lots of other books state that your baby should have X number of bowel movements per day - The Baby Book states the range of normal BMs, relieving you from worrying that something is wrong with your baby because he or she doesn't fit the mold.<br />This book also has great sections on babywearing, breastfeeding, health, milestones, and sleeping. It's a book for parents who want to follow their instincts while caring for their baby.	2000-11-17

This is a fabulous book for parents who want to treat their children with respect and kindness. The Ferber method of letting your child &quot;cry it out&quot; is disrespectful to the small baby and child - it doesn't allow  for the fact that children are biologically designed to sleep with parents.  Sleeping with a parent lets infants develop healthy sleeping patterns and  actually can lessen the chances of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome occuring.  <br />This book explains the reasons why small babies are not designed to  sleep through the night - they have a biological need for food every few  hours, and this is why they don't always sleep in the ways that adults do.  If adults understand that babies NEED to wake up, and aren't just being  &quot;cranky&quot; or &quot;difficult,&quot; they are better able to parent  their babies with respect.<br />Sears has excellent ideas for childrearing and  has written a book that clearly explains sleep theories. It won't so much  teach you how to MAKE your child sleep as it will tell you that it's all  right for your child to learn slowly and gradually.	2000-05-22

It is packed full of clear, unbiased information and facts about the common medical interventions that take place during birth, why many of them are  undesirable or even dangerous, and how they can be avoided. It is  fascinating to see how most of the research proves that medical procedures  that American women have come to view as normal are in fact unnecessary.  This book covers topics like Cesareans, the use of IVs during birth, pain  medications, epidurals, episiotomies, and electronic fetal monitoring. It  shows how such common beliefs as &quot;It's better to have a surgical  episiotomy cut than a natural tear&quot; are in fact false, and why the  medical profession has pushed them so frequently that they have become a  &quot;normal&quot; part of giving birth. This book cleared up a lot of  questions that I had and made me decide very firmly that I would prefer a  long and painful labor to an epidural, which might relieve my pain, but  could also cause myself and, even worse, MY BABY, medical problems down the  line.	2000-04-21

It dicusses the many social and family pressures on boys growing up in America, and how we can relieve some of these pressures so that our sons can grow up to be mature,  sensitive adults. It includes such issues as showing emotions,  competitiveness in sports, homophobia, teenage relationships, violence on  TV and in video games, and family values. It offers many opportunities for  the adults reading the book to think about and discuss their own feelings  on their upbringings and personal morals, and shows how these aspects can  shape boys. It doesn't offer any answers, but rather asks the questions in  such a way that readers can make their own decisions about topics.	2000-04-21

While I didn't 100 percent buy the concept, I found the theory incredibly  interesting and believe that the author gives a great deal of information  to back up her beliefs. It was reassuring to know that my pregnancy  sickness is normal and may exist for a good reason. It also made me feel  better to know that it is normal and probably beneficial to be avoiding  most vegetables, since before I had thought that I was being  &quot;bad&quot; by not eating a well-balanced diet. Anyone experiencing  pregnancy sickness would probably find this book helpful and interesting.	2000-01-15

This book is written from the point of view that after some people eliminate all meat from their diets, they might choose to eliminate dairy also.  Since it is written from this strict vegetarian viewpoint, all of  the recipes are fine for people who have dairy allergies as well. Many of  the recipes include soy cheese products - if you are milk protein allergic  you can eat some of these products, but not all of them, so be sure to read  the ingredient lists carefully. Some soy cheeses are made with casein or  sodium caseinate, which are milk derivatives. This book assumes that you  already know what you are allergic to, if anything, and that you know how  to avoid it. Other than the soy cheeses, all other dairy possibilites are  eliminated and milk substitutes such as soy, rice and almond milk are used  in their place. This book is full of wonderful recipes that make the most  of non-animal proteins such as tofu, seitan, and tempeh. Although I'm not a  vegetarian, I was excited to see so many great-sounding recipes that  tempted me even though I've never eaten seitan and rarely liked tempeh. It  includes delicious rich soup recipes and some noodle and pasta dishes  containing a white sauce made with almond or soy milk, something I wasn't  sure was possible until this book. It contains many spicy, creative dishes  as well, something not always common to dairy-free or vegetarian cookbooks.	1999-12-28

It is amazing to realize how early some children learn to backtalk, and how quickly you can break them of that habit (the sooner the  better!) The book tells you how to recognize the difference between rude  backtalk and requests for topics of conversation (sometimes the difference  can be hazy.) It also shows you how to immediately enact a consequence so  that the child is told unequivocally that their behavior is unacceptable  and will not be tolerated. This book has no room for &quot;IF you do this  again, I will do this...&quot;  It jumps right in with both feet -  &quot;BECAUSE you were rude and that makes me feel bad/sad/angry, I don't  feel like doing this nice thing that I had said I would do for you.&quot;  When the child sees immediate consequences, he learns very quickly and the  behavior can be eliminated within a few weeks. This book is straightforward  and exceedingly helpful for adults who interact with children of all ages.	1999-12-28

To make pat judgements about so many topics that are person-specific is wrong and unfair - for  example, Dr Sharon states that allowing a teenager to sleep in on the  weekends will result absolutely in a lazy adult. Both Henner and Sharon  feel that it is unacceptable to allow a child to take a mental-health day  from school. Attitudes expressed about theories and practices that are  well-accepted in many other countries of the world (breastfeeding to a  later toddler age, the family bed) seem flippant and harsh. Just because  certain attitudes prevail in America does NOT mean that they are correct or  healthier. While the question and answer format has worked well in other  childrearing books, it seemed forced and flip here. I can appreciate that  Henner is a comedienne and that a sense of humor is important, but I didn't  always find the sense of humor in this book appropriate and often found it  grating. There are more comprehensive childrearing books on the market.	1999-12-28

It's full of interesting articles about why foods should be cooked certain ways (for  example, how to cook potatoes for mashing so that they come out right and  not gluey.) It tells stories about how to eat foods in certain cultures,  and about new and interesting types of foods that you may never get to  taste. There are also chapters where the author (and often his wife) review  common foods such as ketchup - giving you descriptions of each brand and  it's flavors and ingredients. The author has a quippy sense of humor that I  found cute and relatively fresh - again, I had no expectations of what his  style of humor was going to be. Apparently from reading some other reviews  here there are people who like the author who feel that this book isn't his  best work... but I recommend it to people who are unfamiliar with the  author.  A friend of mine started perusing my copy when she was over and  later got her own.	1999-12-24

It does contain recipes that call for meat, fish, and chicken.     This book was written primarily for those who are lactose intolerant or allergic to milk protein (two separate  allergies.) It contains helpful sections on how to shop for foods, reading  ingredient listings to find &quot;hidden&quot; dairy additives, and how to  request that your food be cooked properly in restaurants to avoid allergic  reactions. The section on which processed foods are &quot;safe&quot; and  which are not is rather outdated and no longer useful. Some of the foods  she has listed as &quot;safe&quot; are not safe now, as manufacturers often  change formulas and rarely make this known. I'd prefer to just see the list  of additives that may contain dairy or dairy derivatives and maybe some  examples of package listings showing how to look for these ingredients.       The recipe section is creatively done - too many allergy cookbooks rely  heavily on substitutions that result in the finished food having a strange  texture or flavor. These recipes contain &quot;real&quot; foods.     There  aren't many better books out there for those with dairy allergies.	1999-12-13

If you don't like SF, you'll probably STILL love this book. An account of many of the true  stories of the author's interesting life, the book is divided into chapters  which mostly stand on their own - so if you aren't a big reader, this book  is perfect because you can read one chapter and then put it down for a time  before going back to it. I gave this book to my Dad (in his early 50s) as a  birthday present. The beginning section of the book tells stories of  Crichton's time in med school, and the remainder describes the many amazing  things that he encountered while travelling throughout the world.

A friend recommended it and I was thoroughly impressed after simply reading it through the first time. It discusses the ethics of many aspects of Pagan religions and encourages the reader to ask  many questions of him or herself. It made me think more deeply than  anything else I've read in the past year and I am truly grateful.	1999-11-24

She explores the emotional rollercoaster that accompanies this disease and offers many valuable suggestions about how to get off the  rollercoaster and let your body take control of your eating. There are lots  of other good books on eating disorders out there and all of them can be  equally helpful - it's just important to remember that what works for  someone else may not be exactly what works for you, so you should pick and  choose from different methods for recovery and take what makes sense in  your life.	1999-11-24

Rosemary Green should be shown sympathy, but should never have been allowed to publish a book full of so many medically unsound, psychologically damaging ideas. The book tells of her trials and  tribulations while attempting to lose weight through a self-created,  dangerously low-calorie diet. At one point in this book she gives an  example of one of her diets - a total of 657 calories a day! No wonder her  body continued to rebel from this starvation diet by binging! She also  suggests things like taking photos of yourself at your fattest and putting  them up around your house so that you are reminded how horrible you are -  as if criticism and self-hatred ever lead to change! She continues to  repeat the medically-unsubstantiated &quot;fact&quot; that fat people die  sooner than thin people, and repeats many times that fat is ugly.  Anyone  who is stuggling with weight and eating issues should read books like  &quot;Overcoming Overeating&quot; by Hirschmann and Munter or something by  Geneen Roth, not this trash.	1999-07-13
