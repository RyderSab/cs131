Then comes Noo-noo &amp; finally all the Teletubbies are hidden. While 1 or 2 year olds who like the show will probably get some giggles out of it, the book's art work is lacking. It's pretty stale fare, especially the sky. Couldn't they have put at least one bird, or maybe the sun with the baby's face in it up there? This seems to be a rush-job to capitalize on the popularity of the tv show. Looks like it worked - the copy we have is a 5th edition. There's many other pop-up books out there that are done much better, but if your little kiddies love the Tubbies, I'm sure they'll dig this.	2001-10-16

It was written during the Cold War by an extremely conservative republican who thought that Robert MacNamera &amp; JFK were sending the good ol' U.S. of A. to hell in a handbasket by reducing our nuclear tonage as a show of good-will to the Soviets. The U.S. was able to reduce tonage because they formed new nuclear weapons that weighed much less, but the author keeps insisting that losing the &quot;tonage battle&quot; was going to &quot;dig our graves&quot; and by now we should be a Soviet colony. Well, things happened exactly the opposite of what the author claimed they would, so she ends up looking like a paranoid right-wing nut case. The cold war is over - America won. The author was wrong. The only reason this book is still available is a sign of just how big a wig-case the author was - she included something in her will that would make this book continue to be available long after she was dead. If you can't sleep one night &amp; need a good laugh, pick this puppy up!	2001-10-12

The book starts out with the aftermath of the destruction of the Christian church by Holme. He leads other thralls in an uprising for freedom, which ends in disaster. Once again, Holme is in trouble and must flee again. Holme goes to see the sympathetic king, and becomes his personal blacksmith. Holme's wife Ausi and daughter Tora move onto the king's settlement as well. <br />   The family who originally owned Holme and Ausi is down to its last two surviving members - the old chieftains wife and their son. The old woman still wants vengence, meaning she wants to own Tora and Ausi once more. She's too afraid to want to own Holme again...he's far too dangerous. However, the son Svien has other ideas. He loves Tora and wants her to be his bride of her own free will. Svien works things out with Holme and things go well with Svien and Tora.<br />   The clash between Christians and the worshippers of the old wooden gods comes to a head, and the battle between thralls and freemen continues. This is a very untraditional tale for the genre, written throughout with virtually no dialogue. Fridegard is a first-class storyteller, and infuses beautiful descriptions of wildlife and settings like a true master. The trilogy is a truly brilliant work of artistic literature.	2001-09-26

It tells the story of Gilgamesh, 2/3 god and 1/3 man, king of Uruk.<br />In the beginning of the story, Gilgamesh is a strong king, building an amazing and beautiful city. However, the people are unhappy with him because he takes all sons from their fathers and leaves no virgin to her lover. There being no man alive who can contend with Gilgamesh, Aruru (a goddess of creation) made Enkidu, a man-beast strong enough for Gilgamesh to respect. After a harlot sleeps with Enkidu, he leaves the forest and comes to town to find Gilgamesh. The two wrestle, and after some time, Gilgamesh is finally able to throw down Enkidu. But Enkidu's strength is admired by Gilgamesh and the two become as brothers.<br />Wanting to forever keep his name the mightiest, Gilgamesh goes with Enkidu and slays the guardian of the cedar forest, Humbaba. This act greatly angered the god Enlil - and this act would ultimately bring great heartache to Gilgamesh.<br />The goddess Ishtar was impressed with Gilgamesh's actions, and she asked him to be her lover. But Gilgamesh then rattled off a list of all the men she had hurt and her wicked actions, and gave her a &quot;thanks, but no thanks.&quot; Angered, she had Anu create the Bull of Heaven, which attacked Gilgamesh and Enkidu. They eventually slay the bull, but victory is fleeting. In the aftermath, Enlil gets revenge by sickening Enkidu with a deathly illness.<br />Gilgamesh now goes on a long journey, seeking everlasting life. He visits Utnapishtim, man of everlasting life. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh about the great flood that wiped out most all of the world - save for what was on his ark. For preserving life on earth, Utnapishtim was given eternal life. But for Gilgamesh to be young again, he must recover a flower at the bottom of the sea. he gets it, but it's quickly taken away by a serpent. Everlasting life isnot to be Gilgamesh's lot.<br />He returns home, and is exalted as the greatest king ever. Gilgamesh lears important lessons about justice and mortality. His journeys and experiences have truly made him a great king.<br />While redundant at points, this is an amazing tale, told in a straightforward manner that makes it a swift and compelling read. A truly amazing work.	2001-09-26

While there isn't much deep philosophical introspection, it is a brilliant story, crystal-clear, with no wasted words. It tells the tale of Shinji, a young man just becoming aware of his sexuality, and his love for a pearl diver named Hatsue. While the love story is very traditional and familiar, Mishima uses subtle and strikingly vivid imagry to make the book fully come to life in the reader's mind. Mishima was a body-worshiping homosexual, and like the romantic works of Pierre Loti, the boy-girl story is probably a cover-up for a boy-boy relationship. Mishima's lust for the male body comes out in this book during his descriptions of the young men at their club meating. The book's ending, a nice twist, also brings into focus that aspect of Mishima's philosophy and lifestyle. I enjoyed the book very much; it was good company during a sleepless night.	2001-09-19

Miller, who if you read multiple biographic works on him, never was much of a &quot;real person&quot;, but some kind of morphic creature who would become fascinated with something for a while &amp; his entire existence would be geared towards that thing. Sometimes it was UFOs, sometimes the idea of what he thought China was....seemingly anything and everything, just so long as Miller could run away &amp; hide from being an actual individual. During the part of his life covering these letters, he was in his &quot;Japanese phase&quot;. Hoki Miller was an attractive woman who was a cheesy lounge singer &amp; wannabe actress working at a Los Angeles Japanese resteraunt. Miller fell in love with some image he concocted &amp; Hoki saw him for the patsy he was. All this woman did was tease &amp; lead on Miller, and like a fool, he went right along. She never gave him the sexual play he so longed for, but he bought her a new white Jaguar that she quickly smashed up. Miller kept tossing money at her, and even went to Japan with her to try to use his fame there to promote Hoki The Hack's failing acting career. The letters in this collection are no literary masterpieces, and would only be of intrest to hardcore Miller fans or maybe somebody looking for a laugh at a rich &amp; famous old man's expense. If you're not really interested in Miller's personal life, I'd suggest spending your money on something else.	2001-07-24

On one of his trips, he sees a young woman &amp; becomes attracted to her. The book has some beautiful imagry that makes me see the sights, hear the sounds &amp; smell the smells of the snow country. But the book just doesn't have the ability to really draw me in to the character's lives. Instead of fascination, I'm only mildly interested. While the sensual imagry is beautiful, it's not masterful, as in a work like People In The Summer Night. I've read another work by this author, Thousand Cranes, and enjoyed it much more. I was really drawn into the world of the characters in that novel, but not here. Overall, I felt that this book, for the author &amp; classic Japanese literature as well, was a letdown.	2001-07-24

This is an interesting &amp; unique body of work, because the hero in this Viking saga isn't the traditional warrior - his slave is. Holme has freed himself &amp; his family from the homestead that kept them as slaves all their lives. Venturing to a fictionalized trade city, based on the actual town of Birka, Holme ends up becoming a master smith &amp; a man well-respected (by some) &amp; feared (by all). Holme is not satisfied with just his family being free, but goes on to fight for all thralls to become freemen. Another theme in the trilogy that gains more importance in this book, is the spread of Christianity into the heathen land where most people worship barbaric &amp; crude wooden gods. As Holme gets used to being around people, his intelligence &amp; philosophy become sharper, &amp; as in the last novel, there's virtually no dialogue and the book will slip from a modern-day narrator to Holme or other character's own stream-of-consciousness narrating the tale. As in the first book, this is a wonderful story, loaded with beautiful &amp; haunting imagry. The descriptions are vivid &amp; striking. The author is a brilliant artist, making this one of the best books I've ever read.	2001-07-24

The book is written in that dry, stale, matter-of-fact style people were &quot;supposed&quot; to write in back in that day. Instead of describing excitement &amp; espionage, this book is more like an Ed Wood film: the writer talks about exciting things supposedly happening, but no excitement occurs. We're just supposed to assume there's adventure. Aside from the constant boredom, only an idiot wouldn't know who the Scarlet Pimpernel was by about page 20. Since it's so obvious, all the mystery is killed from the outset. From what I understand, the novel was never as popular as the play. I guess people didn't just stand around talking about exciting things happening in the play, but actually showed them taking place. If you're up one night &amp; can't get to sleep, read this book.

This fits the bill. The diary is being kept by a tiny, dying old man. The old man finds that bizarre sexual encounters with his daughter-in-law bring him a strangely pleasing vitality. His enjoyment of life increases with his bizarre sexual deviations. One of the funniest parts is where the old man goes around town buying supplies so he can have Bhudda-like cement footprints made of his daughter-in-law so they can hover over his grave for all eternity. This old dude's got himself quite a foot fetish! Mingled in with his sexual thoughts &amp; encounters are listings of medications he's taking &amp; reports of doctor exams. The book balances the sex &amp; the details of his deteriorating condition well. A very interesting juxtapositioning of concepts &amp; actions. Sex being linked to man's vitality is a recurring theme in Tanizaki's works &amp; is the central theme of this very entertaining &amp; well-written book. Get it. You'll love it!	2001-07-10

The book follows the ups &amp; downs of a common resident, who is taken under the wing of the town's richest man. With his rise in the community, Benoni also makes good with the girl of his dreams, Rosa. But one day, Benoni has a bit too much to drink &amp; his tail starts wagging and bragging. Soon word spreads about his drunken scene and his station in the community falls, as does his standing with his beloved Rosa. This is a beautiful work, where Hamsun accentuates seemingly meaningless &quot;trifles&quot;, but it's just these trifles that make up our lives &amp; their defining moments. This work is a fine example of Hamsun's mastery of simplicity &amp; understatement. Benoni is an outstanding work coming from one of the greatest authors of all-time. Get it. Read it.

Whereas Benoni was the hero of &quot;his&quot; book, he's the goat of &quot;hers.&quot; I think part of what I didn't like about this book was that a character I really loved was taken and made a mockery of. Hamsun seems more driven to show Rosa's spitefulness &amp; hatred, which gets in the way of his usually beautifully simplistic style. Instead of having the easy-going flow of most of his &quot;small Norweigen fishing village&quot; novels, it's more of a vitriolic diatrabe. Hamsun is one of the most brilliant novelists of all-time, but this is definately my least-favorite work of all his works translated into English. If you're a Hamsun lover, go ahead &amp; get it.

The cover of the book, a black background with Krishnamurti's disembodied head floating in the middle, is fairly representational of this work. A thinker's simple thoughts are edited so that one gets a mysterious impression of what should be simply clear. Trying to make him a mystical guru ruins his work &amp; message.

The book begins with a woman thrall, Ausi, giving birth to Holme's child after he raped her. (It seems that virtually every sexual relationship begins with/is always by rape.) The Viking chieftan of the settlement orders that the baby be abandoned to die in the woods, but Holme rescues the child (an unheard of act). He, Ausi &amp; the child flee into the woods, living in a cave for a while. They later relocate outside a trading city on an island. The book has virtually no dialogue in it, and is interesting because the book shifts from blind narration to a &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; perspective from the characters even in the midst of a paragraph. The author does a brilliant job of setting the scenes &amp; describing things in great detail. The book is filled with beautiful, haunting &amp; terrifying imagry. Much like many of the works of Knut Hamsun, this is an &quot;unromantic romance.&quot; The book grabbed my attention early on &amp; held it fast. It's a wonderful story &amp; a brilliant work of art.

If you've read some of his stuff, and have been perplexed by some wild-sounding concepts like the ending of thought, ending the seperation between the observer &amp; that which is observed, &amp; immediate transformation without the space of time, this book will really clear up that confusion or wonder. In it, he clearly spells out what he means by the many layers of the mind...the conscious &amp; the subconscious, dreams, &amp; though (both psycological &amp; practical). Many esoteric-sounding themes &amp; ideas are clearly spelled out in that simple &amp; direct language that draws so many to Krishnamurti's teachings.

Krishnamurti uses many words with specific definitions (specific to himself &amp; used throughout his works) that people might not understand if they don't go deeply into particular subjects. This book helps clarify &amp; define several of them. In a nut-shell, Krishnamurti states &quot;How can anyone find God (the unknown) through the known? All one will find is their own thought's known projections. So to know God (if that's possible), one cannot approach God through the known; through knowledge.&quot; This is part of a larger thought of his, which is: don't believe in anything. Don't believe at all. If something comes to you as-is, on its own, fine. But any seeking...through prayer, thought, traditional types of yoga/meditation, or whatnot, is futile, as you will only find the known. Only when one stops seeking, is it possible for God, Truth, Reality, Enlightenment...call it what you will...to come to one. This, like all of Krishnamurti's works, will be of intrest to existentialists, as he states somewhere/everywhere (I've read so many of his works I've forgotten where!): &quot;Truth is a pathless land. You can't follow another to get there, and none can follow you once you've reached it yourself.&quot; If you dig Krishnamurti, get it.	2001-06-29

This title is an excellent introduction. Krishnamurti is very simple &amp; direct, but unless you've read a good number of his works, you might be confused because he has many unique definitions of words and also breaks down the mind &amp; thought into many layers &amp; categories. This collection of talks were given to students, so the philosophy is very simple. Points that are given emphasis here are regarding people doing what they truly love as opposed to what they think they should do, the need to question belief of any kind &amp; breaking free from one's conditioning. Krishnamurti stayed away from classifying himself &amp; his teachings, but he's an existentialist and this &amp; his other works should intrest people into that branch of philosophy and thinking. He's a worthy blood-brother to Nietzsche. Get this. Read it. You'll dig it.	2001-06-28

Each portion is an interesting blend of &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; and psycological drama. The book becomes more &amp; more compelling as you read on.

If there's one thing the world lacks, it's a good supply of well-written, funny-as-heck books. Luckily, aside from A Confederacy Of Dunces, we have this little gem. The characters are drunks, druggies, skanks, prostitutes &amp; nutzoids. The pace is brisk and the imagry vivid. Most of it seemed to be part of my own life, but just where do you find weed that's so potent that 4 people smoking 5 joints stay high for well over 2 hours?! If you want to spend a day or night having a good laugh over a great book, pick this one up. You'll laugh out loud. And as Martha Stewart says....&quot;It's a good thing&quot;.	2001-06-21

Part of the book deals with his annoyance over the affair, especially his anger at &quot;well meaning&quot; beaurocrats &amp; doctors who seem to be putting off his trial &amp; finally letting him off the hook for having &quot;permanently impaired faculties.&quot; Reading the book, you can easily tell that Hamsun is hardly impaired. Proud till the end, Hamsun wanted to stand up like a man &amp; take whatever punishment the court may give him. No excuses. But all they seemed to want to do was excuse him and/or his conduct. But what really sparkles, are the collection of &quot;trifles.&quot; Hamsun was at his best, in my opinion, in his simple, straightforward works about life in small Norweigen fishing villages, where life's true meaning &amp; beauty shines through seemingly meaningless trifles. Hamsun's prose is brief &amp; to the point, loaded with brilliant understatement. Another interesting aspect of the book is that in his real-life recollections, you can see the origin of characters like Per of Bua &amp; Benoni as well as the philosophical undertones of Shallow Soil &amp; Growth Of The Soil. I've loved everything I've ever read by Hamsun (&amp; that's everything translated into English!) &amp; this book is no different.	2001-06-21

Form gets tossed out the window, and this does make the book a bit of a struggle at times, but that's just the point. It shouldn't be easy to understand another man's feelings &amp; it isn't easy getting Patchen's. This book is definately not for everyone, and I'd almost say &quot;read the last half of the book first if you wanna get it from the get-go.&quot; It took me a few weeks to read this, reading several other things while mulling over parts of this &quot;journal&quot;, but I'm glad I stuck with it &amp; kept thinking about it. It's a very powerful work that crackles like a thundercloud. Just don't expect a straightforward novel. That ain't what this is...	2001-06-18
