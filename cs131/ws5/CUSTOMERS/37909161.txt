US	37909161	R3TEBP9WM0T06A	0446364193	597792275	Along Came A Spider	Books	3	3	4	N	N	I know I'm probably alone here...	I know my opinion does not seem to be shared by the masses, but I definitely do not feel that this book was one of James Patterson's best.  Even allowing for the extra description required to set up a character so that a series can be made out of him (i.e. Alex Cross), Patterson drags this story at best. <br /> <br />I will admit that I read the first 250 or so pages VERY quickly, but all of a sudden the novel seemed to lose steam.  Combine this with the budding romance of Alex Cross that was focused on to the nth degree and did nothing to advance the plot and it made for a very difficult novel to complete. <br /> <br />I made myself finish the novel because I was eager to get on to other Alex Cross novels that I knew received rave reviews.  I too do not like to read a series out of order so I forced myself through the remaining pages.  However, I found myself questioning whether or not ANY of the other Alex Cross books would be worth reading (they are, don't worry) during the course of this book. <br /> <br />One last bit before I conclude, I was INCREDIBLY disturbed by the final chapters of this novel and I do not feel much of the description was necessary to get Patterson's view across. <br /> <br />With all this being said, please do not use Spider as a judge for the other books in the Alex Cross series.  I have not come upon these issues again in any of the other Cross novels I have completed.  But, suffice it to say that it took a little while for Patterson to find a rhythm for his most famous leading man.	2005-09-22

This is only the second Patterson novel I have ever had the pleasure of reading (My first was The Lakehouse.) and I can already see the amazing talent that is possessed by this author.  The emotions that are drawn out in Letters are truly touching and I feel that it takes an amazing depth of talent for anyone to go from writing biological thriller to something so family- and love-oriented.   <br /> <br />Through the letters she shares, Sam is painted as a strong-willed, compassionate woman who is eager to pass on advice to her granddaughter, Jennifer, so that she may avoid making the same mistakes in her future that Sam made as a young, impressionable woman.  Interspersed with these letters, we are privileged to see a relationship grow between Jennifer and her childhood playmate, Brendan, which only becomes successful because of the powerful advice that Jennifer is taking in through her grandmother's writing.  This novel will make you cry, but it will also give you a feeling of warmth when you stop to contemplate how important love really is.	2005-06-21

Perhaps, the reason I liked this book so much was because it was the first of James Patterson's novels that I have ever read.  (I didn't even know that it was a sequel to When the Wind Blows until I read the rest of these reviews!) <br /> <br />While I did think that certain aspects of the plot were a little far-fetched, I reminded myself that we're talking about kids with wings here.  This is certainly not a novel that's meant to have any shreds of truth. <br /> <br />I thought it was a great read and I don't think that the fact its a sequel takes away from the novel at all (though I'm very anxious to read When the Wind Blows now).  I am definitely going to seek out more of Patterson's work to enjoy. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  Don't listen to stuck up critiques who are used to a certain mold and who are afraid to break away from that.  Read this book, enjoy it and move on!	2005-06-21

Let me start out by saying that I do not particularly consider myself to be an advocate of women's lib.  However, this novel seemed to throw the concept that a woman does, in fact, have a brain in her head back to the Stone Age.  I did not like how Riley treated Red.  And I like even less how Red didn't stand up for herself.

However, I do know that I spent 340 pages of reading being fairly entertained, and then 12 pages being SORELY disappointed.

But, when Stacey becomes OBSESSED with getting laid (I apologize for being so blunt but, the author did it, so why can't I?) it gets to be too much.  You have to ask yourself why sex is SO important to her...  The notion that she will become a lesser person for going a year without sex is simply preposterous and once you realize this, you will lose ALL interest in reading the rest of the book. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time!!!	2005-03-11

When I first began reading this novel I was a little nervous.  Not only was it the first mystery that Red Dress has released, but it started out with more description that dialogue (a point that ALWAYS scares me).  But, as I read on I realized that the description had a very easy flow as it was written in a fairly conversational tone. <br /> <br />By the 3rd chapter I was hooked and I succeeded in reading all 300 plus pages of this novel in about 4 hours.  I enjoyed trying to come up with my own assumptions about where the mystery was going and I like that there was still a healthy amount of dry wit, character banter and romance that is requisite for any Red Dress novel. <br /> <br />Warning: Some of the language does seem a bit lofty at times.  But keep this in mind, these people are Harvard gradates who (for the most part) have been raised by the nannies who were employed by rich families.  You wouldn't expect them to speak in slang! <br /> <br />I was OVERLY impressed with Ms. Sturman's first novel and I can't wait to get my hands on more!!!	2005-03-07

The dynamics between these three girls, and the way that they work together so well within the story despite their obvious differences makes for a fantastic tale! <br /> <br />I will say that I thought the ending could have been fleshed out a little better than it was, but on the whole I thought it was great. <br /> <br />My favorite parts of the book were the chapters where the \\"omniscient narrator\\" told the story.  (Normally each chapter is told from the perspective of one of the roommates.)  The voice of this narrator was so snide and to-the-point that you couldn't help but laugh out loud at the turns of events! <br /> <br />Two BIG thumbs up!!!	2005-03-04

This novel was certainly not the type to keep you on the edge of your seat.  It was filled with endless pages of character thought processes and when it came to the climax of the novel, everything was so abrupt, that it really didn't give the reader time to fully process what was going on.   <br /> <br />I like the characters and I could empathize with what they were going through.  I just wish it had been written a little more realistically.   <br /> <br />For an evening of fluff reading, this novel is just the ticket!	2005-02-21

So of course when I saw this title, I just purchased without even reading the back flap (which is not something I EVER do). <br /> <br />I, too, was a little put off by the Fu Manchu and the soul patch at first.  And I gotta admit, that everytime I started pretending it wasn't there, Ms. Gibson brought it up again and ruined my mental picture! <br /> <br />However, I did enjoy the book for what it was: a fluff piece.  I knew early on, that this was not a novel of epic proportions.  It's an entertainment read.  And while I felt there were certain aspects of the book that could have been better (back story could have been more detailed, Rob didn't have to be an adulterer, etc.), I still didn't feel like this book was a waste of time. <br /> <br />One thing I would suggest when reading this book is to forget about everything surrounding the characters.  This may not be an easy thing to do, but when you do, you will find that Kate and Rob are actually quite sweet together.  There are also some comical aspects of the novel that come to life this way as well. <br /> <br />Not the best book I've ever read, but certainly not the worst either.  I would certainly give it a chance and I'm anxious to read some of Ms. Gibson's other novels to see what more she can do!	2005-02-18

I LOVE THIS BOOK!  <br /> <br />I first stumbled across Ms. Hill's Cajun series when I was browsing through Target's book racks one day.  It was The Cajun Cowboy and I figured that any book with \\"cowboy\\" in the title was worth giving a try.  It was AMAZING and I immediately set out to find the other novels in the series. <br /> <br />Of course, when I actually found them I was faced with the inevitable fear that it wouldn't be as good as the novel I'd already read and adored.  My fears were COMPLETELY unfounded b/c this novel was AMAZING!!! <br /> <br />I love the way that Ms. Hill make the reader love Remy's scars.  And the legitimate issues that each character overcomes leaves the reader feeling as though he or she has just experienced something real.   <br /> <br />I think this is my favorite Sandra Hill novel to date!	2005-02-15

Before I begin, let me say that I HIGHLY recommend this book.  I love Sandra Hill's sense of humor and writing style and I would read ANY of her Cajun romances in a heart beat. <br /> <br />Now to be fair, I must say that you can tell this one is her first try at writing about the Cajun lifestyle.  If you read this novel first, you won't pick up on her gliches.  But, if you're like me and you sought this novel out after having read all of the other Cajun specialties, you'll see that Tante Lulu hasn't quite come into her own and the Brothers LeDeux don't have the same camaraderie that they do in the later novels. <br /> <br />You also may have a hard time believing that Luc is really struggling with anything, because he always seems so put together in the later novels.  And you might have trouble believing that Sylvie is shy, because she's never portrayed as such in the other books. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the romance is still steamy and this Cajun boy can melt your heart!  Read it, love it, take it at face value, and enjoy your time in the Bajou!	2005-02-15

Whatever suspense Ms. Kelley was trying to convey was completely over-shadowed by the fact that she was obsessed with sex. <br /> <br />Add that to the fact that the heroine is supposed to be scarred with years of issues and suddenly she loses all of these fears in a week and a half and the reader is left empty. <br /> <br />I like sex in a novel as much as the next guy.  And I'll be the first one to say that these romances shouldn't be 100% realistic (it takes the fun out of it).  However, I fell like I lost several valuable brain cells finishing this one and I feel like the author took her readers for granted in expecting them to believe such far-fetched drivel! <br /> <br />DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE!!!  <br /> <br />	2005-02-14

I read Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE before reading ANGELS AND DEMONS as I'm sure is the case with many people.  However, I feel that if I had read this less popular novel first, I may have enjoyed it more. <br /> <br />I agree with some of the other reviews that Brown's formula for these novels never changes.  In addition, I almost feel like he threw the end because he got tired of what he was doing.  Some of these problems may stem from the fact that it was his first novel of this type and he wasn't sure where to go.  I feel that by the time he got around to writing DA VINCI, he was more comfortable with how to mesh the suspense and \\"history\\" in a novel of this kind. <br /> <br />If I had read this first, I would not have been familiar with the brilliant writing that I experienced while reading THE DA VINCI CODE.  Subsequently, I may not have been as disappointed in ANGELS AND DEMONS.   <br /> <br />This was still a good novel, but I certainly would not recommend it as my top choice for a weekend read.	2005-02-11

I really enjoyed hearing about how all the characters worked through their problems and did their best to create happy situations for themselves, despite life's lemons.  I was especially happy that Gert had someone in the end...  Although real life doesn't always allow for this conclusion, I feel like she went through enough that she deserved whatever happiness she could get.<br />My only complaint about this novel is that it did progress slowly at times.  Occasionally I found myself skimming through some of the thought-monologues of Gert's because she seemed to be saying the same hting over and over.  This does not affect the overall power of the book and I would recommend it despite any slow points there may have been.	2004-04-14

I had read &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; and was absolutely blown away by the power of Album's tale...  Of course, when I realized he had written another &quot;inspiring&quot; book, I immediately put it on my &quot;To Read&quot; list...  Once I did read it, however, I did not find that I got what I was expecting...  This is not to say that I was disappointed, I was instead taken off guard by the angle at which &quot;Five People&quot; is told.<br />Anyone who knows what &quot;Morrie&quot; was like know that it is told directly from Album's perspective.  He interacted with Morrie regularly and he wrote his story for all of us to read...  I thought that &quot;Five People&quot; would be similar to this because I knew that Eddie was his uncle.<br />The fact that this book is entirely fiction, based loosely on things that Eddie had told Album while he was still living, changes the angle of the tale dramatically.  Suddenly, the novel is no longer entirely philosophical, as was &quot;Morrie,&quot; but it is now Album's interpretation of what he believed Eddie would say.<br />The story is inspiring at parts and the way the characters mesh together and interact is laudible.  I also enjoyed the factual information that was woven throughout the tale.  However, I can see where many people may be disappointed with the book.  <br />One reviewer stated well that this book is entirely subjective...  Of you are the type of person who enjoys &quot;touchy-feely&quot; reads, then this book is the one for you.  If you are looking for a deep and insightful guide of what Heaven may hold for you, then I'd say that you should pass.	2004-04-07

The plot was dull, the characters were flat and there was nothing gripping to keep the reader pushing through the novel.

But, unfortunately I'm having trouble determining whether I like the book for the books sake or because I enjoyed the other two Chandler boys' stories...  Because he's so shy, Chase is the most difficult to like, so I feel like Phillips needed to work doubly hard to make this book a success...  All in all I think it was the surrounding storyline and the series wrap-up that made me like it so much.  It wasn't the romance between Chase and Sloane and that was dissapointing.  Still a great book; still one I couldn't put down.  But, instead of absolute fireworks, I was left with wanting to know more about what's gonna happen with the other characters than what's gonna happen between Chase and Sloane.<BR>I'd like to suggest to Ms. Phillips that she write another Yorkshire Falls novel, set 10 years or so in the future, focusing on Kendall's sister, Hannah.

As an aspiring journalist I love the way Grisham wrote &quot;The Last Juror&quot; from the point of view of a young, green newspaper editor!  It was a refreshing turn from his usual main characters, the lawyers.  The suspense of the trial and the ensuing events were not the focus of the story as it implies on the cover (a mistake that was no doubt made by the copywriters and not Grisham himself), so do not get your hopes up for a real thriller like &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot;  However, the emotional pull between Willie Traynor and Miss Callie more than make up for the mishap of the cover teaser.<BR>I am severely disheartened by the fact that so many people are giving this novel poor reviews.  In my opinion, &quot;The Last Juror&quot; is one of the freshest novels I have read in a long time and the choice to approach the legal system from a different point of view was a magnificent choice on the part of John Grisham!<BR>I couldn't put it down!!!	2004-02-23

The conversation actually sunk to the level of sounding like, &quot;I was ALL hormonal...&quot;  What professional author actually writes like that?  <BR>Finally, what are the odds that a couple, one of which being a PREGNANT woman, will meet, &quot;fall in love&quot; and decide to get married within a week?!?  Unbelievable!!!<BR>This book was a waste of time and money!  Don't go near it!!!	2004-02-23

This second installment of the Simply Series is even better than the first one!  I love the interaction between Cat and Logan and I feel that the conflict between the couple is better explained and clarified than the one between Kayla and Kane in the previous novel.  I also enjoy the fact that Kayla and Kane's story is continued throughout the book.  I can't wait for the third installment and I HIGHLY recommend these novels to anyone...  Read the first book first though, or else you'll be disappointed.	2003-12-09

I was a little disappointed that the characters were so flat in their emotions.  I would have preferred to see a little more development and explanation for Kayla's feelings toward Kane.  But, despite the minor lackings of the plot, the book was fabulously entertaining, if not mind-blowing.	2003-12-09

The story was not as frustratingly predictable as romances usually tend to be, and there was a great undercurrent of mystery and suspense throughout the tale.  However, Rosemoor did not disappoint in her exquisite sexual description.<br />This book was the perfect way to both get the reader hot and thinking at the same exact time!!!  A DEFINITE TEN!!!	2003-07-18

And I 've read 'em all!<br />This story is captivating and understandable for anyone who is experienceing first love.  Luke and Julie represent the relationship that every teenager wishes he or she could have.<br />The twist of Luke's cancer in the story is a powerful example of why we must live for the day and learn to deal with whatever life tooses our way!  FABULOUS book!!!	2003-07-15

By strategically placing an author's foreword and afterword within the book, she allows readers to enter her psyche and truly understand her logic for creating her story.  <br />Also, the historical context of the novel helps readers not only to learn about what these life-altering situations meant for people in the not-too-distant past, but also to put into perspective what their parents may have gone through in their lifetimes.  This link to previous generations creates a powerful twist in the tale and the parallel between Darcy's mother's illness and the Vietnam War are both compelling, thought-provoking and touching at the same time.<br />In addition, this book is an easy read with a lot of factual benefits for the readers.  Not only do I highly recommend this novel, but I also commend Lurlene McDaniel for being able to put so much of herself into the story!	2003-07-15

Now I'm twenty-one and I haven't missed a Lurlene McDaniel novel since... not to mention the fact that I've scoured the Internet for every out-of-print book she's ever written.<br />This novel hooked me immediately with its touching story and ability to convey the truth about what life is like for some unfortunate individuals.  Too many times in our sugar-coated society, teens are unaware of the horrors that exist in life.  McDaniel has the innate ability to create the awareness that is so desperately needed by teens while still entertaining the reader as well as not scaring him or her completely.  <br />Emotions run rampant in everyone of McDaniel's novels; but this one is a good starting point because it's incredibly gentle in its realities.  Many adolescents may not comprehend the fact that 16-year-olds get AIDS; but this novel introduces those facts and leaves the readers hungry for more.  And, as we all know, awareness is the best preventative action of all.	2003-07-15

As a romantic girl at heart, I constantly fantasize about the perfect wedding...  And this book effortlessly pointed out just how many things are subject to change when planning a wedding in the most comic manner I've ever seen.<br />Amy Thomas is as clueless as me when it comes to the nuances surrounding a wedding.  Being able to see myself in the main character made the book that much better.  I honestly cried half my way through the book because I was laughing so hard!  <br />I;ve thrown this book to anyone within walking distance of me, since I've been finished.  Any woman whose ever had, planned or even been near a wedding should read this book and laugh at yet another reason for why it is so special to be a woman!  :)	2003-07-14

For anyone who has an overactive libido, this is the book for you!!  Meg/Desiree's exploits with Nick will have you turning the pages while you search for a fan to cool yourself!  <br />This novel was the one that introduced me to Harlequin's Blaze series and, boy, am I glad I found it!  Although, slightly predictable (as most straight romance novels are) Just Toying Around employs seduction, blatant sexual conversation and tender romance to entertain the reader and leave him or her wondering about how they can re-enact some of the scenes in their own love life!	2003-07-14

I did not choose to read it...  I would say that people need to worry more about the quality of their work than what people are going to think about it in the long run.  The way people speak when referring to genders does not necessarily reflect the opinions of the speakers as this book seems to suggest.	2003-07-14

I bought this book after some debate in the store, only to discover that my first instincts upon reading the back cover were right.<br />The story never pulled me in and I found myself angry at the fact that the story never seemed to progress beyond its snails' pace and psycho-babble.  Unless you like vast amounts of descriptions that really tell you nothing in a novel, I don't suggest wasting your time with this one.<br />Moody seems to have the heart to write and the ability to use big words, but hopefully with later novels, she will refine her gifts and actually create something that will be entertaining as well as &quot;thought-provoking&quot;.	2003-07-14

Dating Without Novacaine was my first foray into the world of \\"Chick Lit\\" as it has come to be called.  I have never become so engaged in a book as quickly as I did with this one.  To a Chick Lit novice, this book could be seen as slightly frustrating due to the fact that Hannah has a perfect dating prospect right under her nose.  <br />However, the scenarios in which Hannah finds herself are enough to make any woman laugh until she cries.  Since, reading this novel I have gone on to become an avid reader of all the books in the Red Dress Ink series, along with many others.  I highly recommend this novel to those who are just starting out with stories of this nature.  You'll be surprised what you end up entertaining yourself with once you get hooked!	2003-07-14

Reading this book as a new aunt and a wannabe mom, I can say that it is incredibly funny, strangely scary at points and also amazingly touching.<br />Although I feel that Diary of a Mad Bride was more of a laugh-out-loud kind of novel, there were still points in this where I was wiping my eyes from tears of laughter.  I love Amy's references to her Ob/Gyn as the \\"Crotch Whisperer\\" and to her references of pregnancy symptoms like \\"Dog Nose\\".  But, I also enjoy the fact that this novel has more of an emotional pull on the reader.<br />Moreso, than with the first novel, Wolf brings out the feelings of her main character and, therefore, brings out the feeling of any reader who either is pregnant, was pregnant or longs to be pregnant at some point in life.	2003-07-14

However, I find this to be the very reason that Strapless is a winner.  While keeping with the desire to remain an independent woman, Darcie struggles with wanting to be loved by a man who will accept her for who she is.  What woman doesn't want this in life?<br />I feel that this edition to Red Dress Ink is one of the most powerful in the series.  It was certainly my favorite and I think that readers need to take time to step back and accept the fact that change is a good thing.  This novel may not be conventional RDI, but it is valuable with its lessons that are lurking just below the surface.  You just have to look for them and keep an open mind, as with anything else in life!	2003-07-14

I had a slew of other books to choose from, but she insisted I read The Playboy instead.  Not only did I stay up until 2am finishing the novel, but I became hooked on the characters' lives and eager to read the other stories in the Chandler Brothers' Trilogy!<br />This book can be considered predictable, but certainly not dull!  To anyone who is used to using clues to unravel a mystery, some of the plotlines in this story may seem quite obvious; however, the frustration that is shown between the two main characters (Rick Chandler and Kendall Sutton) as they debate with themselves over their budding relationship can be understood by anyone who has ever tried to convince themselves they are not in love.<br />This novel stands alone and it is certainly not necessary to read the other books of the trilogy.  However, after reading one, nothing will stop me from going out and snatching up the others, just as quickly as I read this one!  A+ and then some for this book!!! HAPPY READING! :)	2003-07-14
