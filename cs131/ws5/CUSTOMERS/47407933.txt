I particularly liked his e-book Really Bad Powerpoint (and how to avoid it) (2001) although I haven't been able to find the (free) download lately.<br /><br />It was indeed a pleasure to get my Amazon delivery of his latest - \\"All Marketers Are Liars: The power of telling authentic stories in a low-trust world\\" - the day before a Boston to LA flight. Perfect. Seth has a terrific way of telling his stories in book form as a quick and fun read. I started the book at Logan Airport and finished somewhere over Kansas.<br /><br />This book is a must read for any marketer who wants to break through the noise of one-way, TV-influenced interruption marketing. Stories are authentic. Interruption is not.  I particularly liked the section \\"Telling Stories in an Internet World.\\" Seth explains why good Web marketing through storytelling beats advertising every time.<br /><br />The examples are fun, breezy and easy to grasp in several hours of airplane time. And hey, Seth says the stories can even fib a bit as long as they are authentic, reach the intended audience and not a fraud. Because marketers aren't liars, they are just storytellers. We tell stories that consumers want to hear. Want an example? It sounded great for me to say I read All Marketers Are Liars starting at Logan and finishing over Kansas didn't it? Because Kansas in the middle of the US and anyone can gague the speed at which you can finish the book. Guess what? I lied. I actually read the Boston Globe in Logan then took a nap at the beginning of the flight. The plane didn't even fly over Kansas (I asked the pilot). But I did finish \\"All Marketers Are Liars\\" on the plane and it is a great book. Read it and learn how to be a better marketer.	2005-05-24

When I pre-ordered the book prior to its publication, I was curious about \\"Searching for the Sound\\" because there was no other writer credited. Many biographies are written with the help of professional writers whose fingerprints end up all over the writing. But what a terrific surprise that Phil did it himself! His writing is very much like his bass playing: sometimes forceful and at the forefront (often I was very conscious of the actual writing because of Phil's unusual turn of phrase). And just like on the bass, at other times he held back and told the story through simple narrative lines. But throughout there is a cosmic, trippy kind of vibe going on in his writing that's unmistakably the Grateful Dead.<br /><br />And how great to finally hear the actual tales of what it is like to play the music! Many other books on the band triangulate the band from a variety of perspectives missing out on the making of the music itself.  However nobody but Phil gets the onstage angle to the story. My favorite scene was a terrific ten or twelve pages about Egypt. My wife and I did our honeymoon in Egypt (alas, several years after the band played there). Phil's terrific descriptions of the weird and wonderful Cairo streets and his negotiations with officialdom to play next to the Sphinx are as good as any travel writing can possibly be.	2005-05-05

Rather than complex theories, this book provides substance. I only wish I had come across Zhivago and her ideas when I was starting out in the business world.

Those Who Save Us, while certainly not marketed as one, really is a historical literary thriller in every way. And it's a terrific one indeed. Jenna Blum's writing style reminds me of David Liss more than any other writer.<br /><br />Those Who Save Us is a real page-turner. At the end of each chapter, Jenna Blum left me hanging and wanting (no needing) to know what's next. Yes, I cared about the characters very much -- but like a great thriller, I was also drawn into the plot in a way that I couldn't let go.<br /><br />OK, so the book is about choice and the backdrop of the horrors of the holocaust are terrible indeed, but I was expecting all that. What I wasn't expecting was that the narrative would be so fast-paced. It is quite an accomplishment for an author to deal with moral issues in history and entertain the reader at the same time.<br /><br />So here's my two cents for Jenna Blum's literary agent: If you haven't already, I think you should consider marketing the mass-market paperback rights in the literary thriller category. This book should have a completely different cover, different marketing, different blurbs and different cover copy to appeal to people who buy books in airports and through Amazon's \\"thrillers\\" category. This is an entertaining book! Don't hide that fact!	2005-01-02

I lived in Japan for seven years and read this book on a recent trip back.  Barry Eisler, who was based in Japan for many years, worked for the US Government and earned his black belt at the Kodokan International Judo Center in Tokyo.  This is a rare book set in Tokyo that gets the details of setting and mannerisms correct.  Too many Japan themed efforts are sloppy and just plain wrong.  Your reviewer lived and worked for seven years in and around the exact places described in the novel.  The book was read and this review written around the corner from one of the coffee shops described in the book.  And another rare feat by Eisler  a Japanese-translated version of RAIN FALL was published in Japan to rave reviews from the local media.<br />John Rain is an efficient killer who will take on any assignment where the death needs to appear natural.  But hes a killer-for-hire with particular rules of engagement  he only accepts contracts to eliminate principal parties and he will not touch women or children.  The plot starts quickly when Rain s technologically fascinating killing of a Japanese Government official on a subway train goes wrong.  There are other people who come from the shadows of the subway car suddenly interested in the contents of the corpses suit pockets.  As his fee is deposited into a secret account the next day, Rain steps up his caution.  But he finds himself hanging out with a jazz pianist who just happens to be the daughter of the government official.  And Rains old CIA buddies from Viet Nam are mixed up with the dead man somehow and come after him.  In great mystery tradition, he doesnt know who to trust and there seems to be no way out for Rain.<br />Putnam Publishers says Eisler is at work on another novel featuring John Rain.  If he gets the sophomore book to work as well as the debut, we have a major talent to look forward to.Rain.

Without the technology guru, NeuroStimix's future is in jeopardy just as a new product designed to aid spinal cord injury victims is about to come to market.  Valmont engages PI August Riordan to help find the missing man and we soon learn that the disappearance is part of a larger conspiracy to use NeuroStimix technology for dastardly purposes.  To complicate matters, the missing man is Valmont's buddy and Valmont's own brother, as a spinal injury patient, would benefit from the NeuroStimix discovery.<br />Co-founder of a failed Internet start-up, Mark Coggins injects lots of local color into his work.  Technology-types and dot-com veterans will especially appreciate the Silicon Valley photos and clever quotes, which open each chapter.  Settings and situations will be familiar to industry types, but the jargon is not overwhelming.  The book is even dedicated to the Pets.com Sock Puppet.<br />VULTURE CAPITAL is the second in a series featuring August Riordan, a private eye we first met in Coggins' well-reviewed debut THE IMMORTAL GAME (2000).  THE IMMORTAL GAME received extraordinary attention for a debut title from a very small press.  It was chosen as a Penzler pick and nominated for a Shamus Award.  This would only happen because the book was good.  Expect similar praise for VULTURE CAPITAL.

This taut, fast-paced debut is certain to put Jonathon King on high on the crime series favorite lists.  This is one of those thrillers where time just flies by and pages turn effortlessly.<br />Max Freeman is an ex-cop from the gritty streets of Philadelphia.  Caught in a life-or-death shootout, his career ended at the same moment a bullet from his service weapon ended the life of a twelve-year-old suspect.  Taking a lump-sum payment to leave the force, Max lives to the life of a hermit in an isolated shack in the middle of the Florida Everglades.  He's made himself so far removed from people that he must paddle his canoe through canals and streams to get to the nearest civilization - an Everglades ranger station.<br />But Max's world is turned upside-down as he finds the corpse of a child on his river.  The demons he's beaten back return to push Max to find the killer(s).

The book keeps you guessing `till the end and is filled with just the right amount of twists and turns.<br />Jonathon King is a new novelist to watch.

The Medici Dagger is a fast, light, yet predictable read.<br />Five Hundred years ago Leonardo da Vinci crafted an indestructible and super-light alloy and used it to create the Medici Dagger.  According to legend, bad guys with such a weapon could do unspeakable things.  However, the only way to actually find the dagger is to read Leonardo's long-lost journals and solve the encrypted message within the Circle of Truth.  It is up to our hero Reb, who's day job is a daredevil Hollywood stuntman, to find journals in order to locate the Dagger and thus keep it away from the baddies and save the world from destruction.  Reb is the perfect guy for the job.  His father was a Leonardo scholar and also the curator of the National Gallery of Art, so Reb has been well schooled in the Great Man from an early age.  But, tragically, Reb's parents both died in a mysterious house fire leaving the soon-to-be-orphaned boy to jump from the family home in a foreshadowing of his stunt-man career.<br />This is Cameron West's first fiction.  He's the author of the New York Times best-selling memoir First Person Plural: My Life as a Multiple.  West has quite a skilled literary agent - The Medici Dagger has been sold to Paramount for a movie slated to star Tom Cruise.<br />If a fast-paced mixture of stunts, comedy, hunts for 500-year-old artifacts, international locales, unbelievable set-ups and bad guys with black hats to make certain you know who they are appeals to you, The Medici Dagger may be just the thing for a few hours of adventurous escape.<br />David Meerman Scott	2002-02-03

The initial release includes as the cornerstone a weighty volume of over 60 short stories written throughout her career, now collected together for the first time: The Selected Stories of Patricia Highsmith.

The comprehensive volume brings together stories from Highsmith's five previously published collections: The Animal Lover's Book of Beastly Murder; Little Tales of Misogyny; Slowly, Slowly in the Wind; The Black House; and Mermaids on the Golf Course.  Much has been made of Highsmith's personal life, including her sexuality, expatriate lifestyle in Europe, and the misunderstanding and ignorance of her fellow Americans.  Was she compelled to live in Europe because her works are too twisted for her countrymen?  Or maybe they were ahead of their time?<br />In the Animal stories, beasts and bugs are plotting and intelligent creatures who coldly calculate (in the first person no less) the exploitation or destruction of the neighboring humans.  You've got to love being inside a caged elephant's head as she sucks up a huge trunk of water and sprays the people staring at her or a cockroach's mind as he explains the merits of the crumbs on the various floors of the hotel he lives in.  In a way, Highsmith relates to animals more warmly than she does people.  The collection also includes a series of very short stories, vignettes actually, written in the third person and detailing the women of a suburbia that Highsmith obviously deplored.  In stories such as The Perfectionist or The Perfect Little Lady, Highsmith paints a landscape that's a nice and neat on the surface but full of wickedness and murder underneath.<br />True mystery takes the reader into an unpredictable, twisted and scary world.  Highsmith writes true mystery.  This is most certainly NOT the formula PI novel with a simpleton murder and nice and neat search for the culprit.  Highsmith doesn't rely on simple cat and mouse tension.  Instead, she's a master of an unpredictable world, a cold and dark place where even you, the reader, are capable of murder.  These are not feel-good works.  The good guy usually loses, (that is if you can find a good guy).  But the reader wins big because the work is so utterly interesting.

Living as an outcast, but constantly watched by her parole officer, Rachel begins to slowly pick herself up.  Her seventeen-year-old daughter Amy, just like the long-ago jury, is convinced that Rachel was indeed her father's murderer.<br />But Rachel has had more than a decade to plan revenge.  And she's learned from the best.  In prison, from the outcasts and hoodlums she did time with, she's learned tricks and techniques, plotting a fantastic revenge on the real killer.<br />Throughout the early parts of the book, we're inside Rachel's head as she returns to life on the outside.  The inner psychological drama, while deftly handled, wasn't as appealing as the fast-paced, cat-and-mouse suspense of the latter half.  As the real killer and the one who went to prison for a crime she didn't commit match wits, the pages turn and the heart thumps.	2001-09-25

The novel's New York atmosphere -- reeking, overwhelming, charming, quaint and foul -- makes an unforgettable location for a thriller.  Jim Fusilli's got New York down.  Following Terry Orr from the book's opening death scene as a cabdriver is found slain in the city's downtown meatpacking district, a reader feels compelled to stop, look around and sniff.  You're in New York and Fusilli's New York grabs you and forces you to pay attention.<br />Terry is a man haunted by an act of violence that took his wife and infant son.  She was a beautiful, Italian artist and with her passing, Terry pours his love into his twelve-year-old daughter Bella.  They do cool father-daughter things like go to rock concerts and gallery openings.  After the cabdriver's death, Terry finds himself witnessing other seemingly isolated events including an explosion at a gallery that once displayed his late wife's work.  He's on his way, honing the PI trade that he's adopted to rid himself of his demons.  Terry tends to leave Bella with her Nanny as he moves from one part of Manhattan to another, searching for the people he's lost, but the daughter who loves him may quite possibly be his best hope for survival.<br />The gritty pulse of the city comes alive with scene after scene like a pick-up basketball game in a downtown &quot;cage&quot; court where perspiration from buffed basketball bodies splashes off the page.  Terry studied Turn of the Century New York at St. Johns University and we're with him as he admires a converted bank building in Harlem or the newel post of a Brownstone.

To generate great character motivations for a cool twenty-something female within a novel or story male writers should flip to Tiara for helpful action and dialog.

It's the great telephone worker details and settings that make this book so compelling.  We've got underground warrens of cable below manhole covers, long-forgotten dungeons of telephone technology and cell-phones as part of the plot.  Isn't it great to read a well-crafted and tight thriller that also describes a world we all know must be just behind the \\"danger, no entrance\\" sign but we've never actually seen?  Cops, secret agents, Medical Examiners and the like most often the subjects of thrillers.  But because they are always on TV and in movies, we know something about them and so as thriller fodder they sometimes fall flat.  Not with telephone repairmen, Ledwidge has crafted a wonderful fast-paced tale from their unknown world.	2001-04-16

The author's choice to organize into section such as suits, dresses/skirts, hair and accessories was the right one.  The book would have been less appealing if it had been organized, say, by decade or by music style.  The text supports the photos without saying too much.  All the biggies are here - Madonna's bustier, the Beatles moptops, the Stones suits and Kiss makeup.  Plus many others that are less famous but just as important.  Put on some great music, turn it up and enjoy!	2001-04-12

The book is logically organized.  Section include a well-written introduction essay, a blues timeline to ground us in the history, decade-by-decade highlights, great coverage of \\"blues legends\\" and an A to Z section covering everyone who's important in blues.  Great photographs and insightful captions throughout enhance the text.<br />At first, I found myself looking up my favorites - Albert King, Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, James Cotton but very quickly I was soaked in the stories of artists I knew much less about.  A good read that captures the blues atmosphere in all its forms.	2001-04-12

Great photos from the early days in London and the infamous US tour are included together with groupie shots and record label exec shots.  The photos include both color as well as black and white.  Somehow, the almost dreamlike B&amp;W shots seem to capture the essence of the dark clubs and the punk scene in a different way than color photography, so the inclusion of both enhances the book.  The text and captions are good, adding value without drawing too much away from photos that speak for themselves of a band that created their own rules.	2001-04-10

Every appearance, concert, recording session and disk is cataloged in this amazingly well researched volume.  A must for Floyd fans.  The band's early history, particularly the 1960s, is well documented.  Also done well is the famous Roger Waters / David Gilmour rift - this difficult history is analyzed so we can see each point of view.  As the founding members go their separate ways, they have different paths in the  book's catalog of events.<br />The photographs are great and include many very early shots.  I only wish that captions had been included, however.  I'd like to know if any of the shows I attended were captured on film and included in the book.	2001-04-09

As all good photos should, each tells complex story.  I found myself lingering over most of them.  Great editing and photo selections - young Rolling Stones, smiling Jimi Hendrix, a very colorful Madonna after several pages of black and white shots.  Dig it.<br />Thankfully, the book didn't impose any arbitrary order - no chronological or geographical or other organization.  This helped my enjoyment - somehow the Sex Pistols followed by Bruce Springsteen makes the book better than if the photos were forced into categories.<br />The book also made me a bit sad - so many of the musicians are dead - Keith Moon, Zappa, Hendrix, John Lennon, Brian Jones, Freddie Murcury, Sonny Bono and more...  Fortunately their artistic and photographic record exists.	2001-04-08

Great layouts - the more powerful images rightly stand alone in a spread, while background and other less important photographs appear side by side.  Creative use of color - Black and white photos are often on wonderful purple or red backgrounds that make them jump and don't distract.  Great graphic and type choices are everywhere.  Congratulations go to the book's creative team.  The credits from Vision On Publishing list \\"Book Design by Nuisance\\" and \\"Reprographics by AJD\\" - great work.<br />Of particular note was the well-balanced choice of photos and interviews to include.  Normally, movie books have way too many shots of the name-brand stars.  Of course we hear from Guy Ritchie and Brad Pitt in Snatch, but great coverage of extras, production people and even Holly the Dog (who gets a two-page spread) make this more than the usual fanzine.  In fact, its more like a coffee table art book.	2001-04-08

Am I no longer young?  Am I a different person now?  It seems only yesterday that I was sitting in clubs watching the likes of The Ramones, The Clash, the B52s and the Talking Heads...<br />But wait.  There are solutions for a revisit.  Last summer I packed my wife and seven year old daughter and went to a triple bill - Psychedelic Furs, GoGo's and B-52s.  Way cool.  My kid loved it.  I kinda felt young.  Wasn't quite the same, but...<br />... now I can sit at home and page through these terrific photographs.  Blank Generation Revisited is a perfect way to revisit.  Yes, we're older and that scene is long gone, but this book captures the era with style and substance.	2001-03-29

Game theory (as exemplified by the well-known Prisoners Dilemma) as a backdrop for a novel is unique and refreshing.  And MacDonald is a great writer.  His choice of writing the book in first person, rather unusual for a thriller, was a good one because readers can really get into the main character's head as the mind games unfold and explode.  The settings are fun - delightfully sunny African beaches and dusty stoic Oxford brick.  Fast-paced and memorable.	2001-03-20

A good thriller carries us away from our own lives for a few hours of heart-pounding pleasure.<br />Vernon Gary has succeeded in carving a story out of a strange and misunderstood world.  It's all here - dangerous drug cartels, misfit IRS agents, even fighting Pit Bulls - all surrounded by the corrupting influence of way too much money.	2001-03-17

We get inside views of the lives of performers, laborers, cooks, cleaners and assorted hangers-on.  We travel on the circus train throughout North America and we caravan around Switzerland and Italy.  We meet weird and wonderful characters from many countries.  This book was particularly informative for me as my great-uncle was a circus performer in the `40s and `50s (George Lerch - he combined wirewalking and juggling).  Schmitt knows his stuff and is a terrific writer.  He deftly alternates between the first-person account of the main character's exploits intermingled with a dozen or so vignettes, each describing an important character (even his dog).  Schmitt has taken me into a world I only knew from my great uncle's fading publicity photos and programs - and I thank him for that.	2001-02-25

Our befuddled Englishman meets a couple of beach bunnies and we're off for a wild romp with impossibly funny situations coming at a quick clip.  Crocker knows his California babes well and his English Gentlemen better - pace, language and action are nearly flawless.  Too often inter-cultural conflict hams up or misses the mark on one or the other sides.  It would be great to see an opposite side of the pond version from Crocker.  How about a Walter Matthau-type traveling to London and mingling for a few weeks with a couple of Sloan Rangers?	2001-02-19

This book is not only funny, touching and original, it's also got a thriller-like, page-turning plot.

This is one that gets put on the special shelf to be read a second time.	2001-02-19

Gertler does a great job mixing important back-story details from when the characters were teens thirty years earlier into each of the two narratives as she pushes the present-day stories forward.  Too often back-story is written (and edited) without much thought, simply as a device to provide details to tie things together.  But in Jimmy's Girl, the back-story is more important than the present and is written with power.  This book took me by surprise.  I was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy and expected to read only a couple of chapters, but ended up finishing it in two very enjoyable evenings.	2001-01-11

The Forger has terrific descriptions - of the art world, of wartime Paris, of the tale's quirky characters combined with a thriller-like plot full of suspense and plot twists.  It is a rare writer who can combine these unrelated literary talents - Watkins has succeeded.  The descriptions of the local caf&eacute; are so deftly written I re-read the passages several times.  The Forger is an original, certainly not a fake.	2000-12-31

For me, it's even more powerful than Silence of the Lambs, my standard to which all similar books were (`till now) held.  The Girls He Adored best feature is the way Nasaw deftly switches the personalities of the main character-often several times within a chapter.  We see the killer's strikingly different persona from both his own perspective and from other characters points-of-view.  Nasaw's superb handling of these often rapid switches is flawless.  As an added surprise, the main character tosses around some engaging humor.  In the middle of a chilling scene, he says something such as: \\"Sometimes having a dissociated identity was no frigging picnic.\\"  This fast-paced, well-plotted story with depth of character should appeal to thriller fans and mystery readers alike.	2000-12-23

The book works as we gain insight into the minds of a married copuple through their hysterical thoughts on a subject as potentially powerful as having a baby together.  What a comedy setup.  And Elton's writing is terrific.  Funny almost always, but here and there some sad and serious parts (but not too many!).	2000-12-17

It will turn that permanent scowl of jaded airline travel back into a playful grin (at least for a while).  It's fascinating to see where the various features we take for granted came from - drink carts, flight attendant uniforms, airline company logos, the color schemes of the planes themselves.  Fortunately, Lovegrove took an international perspective and not just a domestic (either UK or US) one.  OK, so do I take the book on my next trip (AA BOS to LAX tonight)?  Sure, and then when the plane is delayed (due to air traffic control the pilot will say) I'll lean back, smile and consider what it used to be like...	2000-12-09

Like a good TV spot, we're with each character for a very short time before we move on to someone else.  Like a good music video, I was drawn in and hooked in the first seconds and interested both in the message and the entertainment value.  Each of Bogosian's well-drawn and memorable characters feels cut off from suburban mall culture, each considers himself or herself somehow above the mall masses, but each has different reasons for feeling superior.  The violent stew created as everyone comes together on the fateful night makes for a great read - and I'm sure will eventually become a successful movie too.	2000-12-03

Let's send it to Aunt Milli to show her we've come this far!&quot;  I can imagine myself saying more or less that, sometime in the mid-1960's, as we're cruising in our Rambler station wagon on the way to summer camp.  This collection is great.  I ran across it in a bookstore, giggled as I paged through it, and immediately bought one as a housewarming gift for the couple who has everything.  But when I got home, I found myself opening the package up to giggle some more.  I felt kind of sad actually giving it away - the same feeling as sending off a postcard.  It goes into the mailbox and it's gone, but not forgotten (at least for a moment).  The collection is not only funny, it says a lot about America.  I guess I need to get my own copy of the book...	2000-11-23

The book's best quality is the first-person narrator.  Seventeen-year-old Neil tells us the story in his own voice, but unlike other first-person teenage narrators, Alan Watt captures the thoughts, actions, fears and emotions of a young person extremely well.  In so many other books the narrator seems like a kid written by an adult, either too wise or to naïve for his (or her) supposed years.  As Neil tells us his story, Watt deftly moves from action to thoughts, from detail of the crime to the results of the action within the walls of his school, at home and in Neil's private world.  Terrific teenage first-person narrative of a multi-layered story makes Diamond Dogs an important book.	2000-11-02

And the music references-just like High Fidelity, the musical detail is packed into every page.  Without the deft pen of Bill Flanagan, this interesting soup of a subject matter could have fallen flat, or worse, got caught up in self-absorption.  But Flanagan has written a novel that works terrifically as a novel-good characters, fast-paced plot, great settings.  The combinations: great music detail, well-written fiction and funny/sleazy entertainment biz cliches make this book a must read.	2000-10-31

Each has boatloads of \\"friends\\" yet each finds herself ultra alone in the world.  Each runs with the A-list crowd.  The collection of stories could have been ultra-repetitive.  But Bushnell deftly chose different literary points-of-view for each story.  Janey is searching for her man in third-person limited.  The dysfunctional couple, James and Winnie, are written in an edgy present-tense by an all-seeing, all-knowing, unnamed narrator (Bushnell herself of course) so we get healthy doses their thoughts about each other.  And nutty Princess Cecelia could only tell us her own story-and she does-in the first person.  The seemingly simple, yet important choice of point-of-view, written by a skilled author turns a good, yet potentially repetitive book into an good collection.	2000-10-30

The writing is down and dirty, like the photographers themselves.  But it works because of the subject.  Get in click the photo and try not to throw up while you're doing it.  Like most Yanks living a cozy life, I didn't know many details about the famous struggles in SA in the early 1990s.  And I wouldn't have chosen to read a straight history.  But the combination of first-person accounts of tragedy together with terrifically vivid and horrible photos and a gripping tale of danger lurking around every corner makes for an ideal way to learn something about that fascinating and difficult time in world history.	2000-10-30
