The story of Eleeri and Tharna is delightful and a must read for any WW fan as well as horse-lovers.  If you haven't read it I highly recommend you get out there and get a copy before it is out of print!	1998-03-09

All of the authors are very talented and stick to the basic WW theme so well.  Again, it is a steping stone for beginning authors as well as beginning readers and fun for both as well as a delight for long time Norton fans!	1998-03-09

This series has got to be one of the most enduring ever written.  It is constantly growing and changing with each new addition to it.  If you haven't read any of Nortons work and love si-fi/fantasy you will never be disappionted here!  The story of Kaththea is a great read.  And worth the effort to find!	1998-03-09
US	52790188	R112DJY8YV7HZ1	0812547438	743664410	House of Shadows	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Fascinating reading!	This is more of a supernatural thriller than a si-fi type book...one of the few that I have read by Ms. Norton (&amp;Miller). The story of Susan and Kuydall house is a nifty tale and well worth the read if you can find it.  A novel addition to any Norton collection!	1998-03-09
US	52790188	R3JWKL071SE4RB	0441784356	553372531	The Stars Are Ours	Books	4	3	3	N	N	An interesting read...yet another thought-line	I would like to see Ms. Norton expound on this train of thought again.  The story of David Norton and the Free Scientists is a good one and worthy of reading.  Ms. Norton often comes up with an idea that makes you think...it is one of the things which makes her one of the genres best.  A good addition to your library if you can find it.  I have read mine many times.	1998-03-09

These stories are well rounded and interesting.  They bring new ideas and flavor to the Witch World saga.  Each book set here, whether by Ms. Norton personally, or a collaboration with another, &quot;fleshes out&quot; the place and the times.  They don't have to appeal to everyone.  That is one of the refreshing strongpoints to the series.  She is not afraid to see new ideas or changes to the world she has created here.  Just one more reason she is who she is.	1998-03-09

These are great stories not only for cat people, but fantasy/si-fi readers as well.  A collection of shorts is a wonderful place for authors to get exposure and feel out new story lines as well as giving beginning and long-time genre followers a chance to expand their tastes.  It is always fun when you see someone new in the older collections grow to become a fine author!	1998-03-09

I have been a fan of WW from the beginning and, while I have the '83 edition of this book, this was the only place I could find the title.  An interesting story of High Hallack and An-Yak and I believe this was the only illustrated WW book.  It you are lucky enough to stumble across it, buy it!	1998-03-09

Each giving a different insight into the WW series.  Bringing new thoughts and ideas...a very satisfying read...as all the books in this trilogy were.  They are all good additions to your library.	1998-03-09

I have the '84 ACE printint of this book and it is still as fresh today as it was the first time I read it.  This is one of the reasons Ms. Norton is such a highly regarded author of this genre.  If you haven't read this one, try an find one.  A very enjoyable read.  She brings Kethan and Car Do Prawn alive!	1998-03-08

Ms. Norton is one of the best  authors in the genre and this book is typical of her work.  If you haven't read it, find a copy and do so.	1998-03-08
US	52790188	RTXY0W70OX3SG	0345351878	347306388	Restoree	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A very nifty story by Ms. McCaffrey!	I have a '67 copy  of this book...much the worse for wear from many readings.  Since she has gone on to expound on quite a few of her earlier works, I would love to see her do the same with this one.  Sara &amp; Harlan are a great two-some and I still think of this as one of my favorite works of hers.  Easily read, it is more than capable of standing alone.  A must for any McCaffrey fan.	1998-03-08

This group if shorit are gread and, in a way, introduce us to several characters that are filled out in &quot;Witch World&quot; novels.  I own the Daw'80 paperback and have read it many times.  If you can find a copy, I highly recomment it!	1998-03-08

The story line is ingrossing, the characters absorbing and powerful.  This is Norton at her best and one of the reasons she is a master of her craft!	1998-03-08

I have all three of these books and can only hope that there will be more.  Once again we are taken into yet another realm of fantasy by one of the genre's most skilled & talented authors.<br /><br />***I would like to restate that my review is for the books themselves and not the vocal tapes. Thank you.	1998-03-08

It didn't hold me as quite a lot of her works have, but it is entertaining and fun to read and if you are a fan of her works, as I am, you will enjoy this one as well.	1998-03-08

I have read it a few times, but not my favorite work by Ms. Norton.  It DOES tend to stick with you however.  A good read for Norton fans who like diversity in their authors.  Not really one of her normal works, but considering the original stories began in '47, quite original for the times!	1998-03-08

It is well written and enjoyable and quite different from other books she has done even though it is in the same genre.  I enjoyed it a lot.  I think you will too.	1998-03-08

I own the June'77 1st. edition of this book and, while it IS a collection of shorts, it isn't a pre-quel to &quot;The Girl Who Heard Dragons&quot;.These stories span decades.  &quot;Lady in the Tower&quot; was copyrighted 1959 and for 1970 &quot;The Thorns of Barevi&quot; was a bit risque.  Each story stands well on it's own with no other additions necessary.  It gives you an insight into quite a few of the realms she has gone on to create.  It's fun to go back and see where a lot of her ideas started!	1998-03-08

If you are a fan of this master, then this book is a must!	1998-03-08

However, these stories are a great read &amp; I have many friends who ARE cat people who, though they don't usually read this genre, read these because I hooked them on them!  Sigh, if it were just dogs it would be perfect...one can but hope!	1998-03-07

I have the whole series...as I do all of her works.  This is a really great premise of 2 extremely different clutures which are remarkably alike.  From the common people to the way their worlds are run...and how they can work together when they work at it.  This is one of my favorite series  period...and I recommend it highly to all of &quot;the next generation&quot;!	1998-03-07

This should have been a short story for one of her anthologies...like &quot;the Thorns of Bavari&quot;.  There was a lot of potential, not only with the main humanoids, but the Coelura as well.  It was a cute, quick read, but NOT enough to pay the price of a paperback today.	1998-03-07

I agree with Smoore...that the story is compleeing and Hambly giving us dragons that don't hoarde gold for greed, but because it sings to them.  I have had my copy since it was first published and it is still one of my favorites...though she has written many others which have captured my heart as well!	1998-03-04

Ms. Hambly does an excellent job continuing her story and I highly recommend the whole trilogy.  While each story is more than capable of standing alone, there is a satisfying sense of completeness when enjoyed in its entirity.	1998-03-04

Hambly continues Joanna's story with this book and continues to develope her cast of personalities.  All the books in this trilogy stand alone, but, again, once you start you want them all.  One can but hope that she will&quot;make more&quot;!	1998-03-04

I did not see the first two listed (Gryphon in Glory and The Crystal Gryphon), but highly recommend all of them.  Each can stand as an individual work as well...something a lot of writers overlook these days.  This is fantasy at it's very best and I recommend it to anyone interested in other worlds/realities.	1998-03-04

In this final installment of her &quot;Dog Wizard&quot; trilogy, you can only home she will do what so many other others are fond of doing today...write andother one!  These books are well written and can easily stand independently of each other, but once you read one you want more.  Today, it seems, you can get halvway through some workd and already see the &quot;to be continued&quot; notice at the back.  There is no feeling of closure to the story and you know you are going to have to buy a couple of more books for satisfaction.  Come on now...Ms. Hambly is a gifted story-weaver and lets each of her works stand on their individual merit.  These books are a must read for any true fan of fantasy!	1998-03-04

Ms.  Hambly weaves a delightful tale of magic, love and good verses evil in this first of her series.  It also shows (in its own way) how people can have things in common when they come from different backgrounds and cultures.  This is one trilogy I would recommend investing in all 3 books for.	1998-03-04
