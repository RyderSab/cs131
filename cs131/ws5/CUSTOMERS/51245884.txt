Zakes Mda, however, has achieved this mixture admirably in this novel of his native South Africa. The political events of pre- and post-Apartheid periods take a central place in the story. Yet he manages to avoid being overly heavy on facts and details as he builds the narrative around the impact of one specific event and its aftermath on one small community, Excelsior. He captures the essence of life under Apartheid and the difficulties awaiting all when the regime ends. Old prejudices and tensions remain and the transition to the new SA adds new challenges and conflicts, including among the black political leadership.<br /><br />Mda uses the 1971 case of the Excelsior 19 as the focus of the first part of his account. A group of white men and black women were charged with violation of the Immorality Act that prohibits intimate relations across race lines. The primary character is Niki, one of the Excelsior 19 women, whose life story is a symbol for this time and place. As a na√Øve, pretty 18 year old, she attracts the attention of a white Afrikaner who assaults her and keeps pursuing her. Escape into marriage is some protection and also results in her confidence growing. Life is good with a husband and her son, Viliki.  Never questioning her role as a servant and second class citizen, a humiliating incident with her white woman boss changes all that.<br /><br />Her rage leads her to take revenge. Realizing her power as a black beauty and the hold it has over white Afrikaners, she applies it deliberately. The mixed-race daughter Popi is evidence of the hushed-up relationship. Despite the indisputable evidence of children like Popi, the charges against the Excelsior 19 are withdrawn.  Still, those implicated and their families have to somehow work out their lives and their various relationships: within families, among neighbours, between Afrikaners, English and Blacks and Coloured.  Niki and her children also suffer the consequences. As the narrative of their lives continues, the focus shifts to Popi and her extraordinary beauty. Her features increasingly reveal her parentage to everybody in the community. In the new SA she can play an important role in the community despite the continuing suspicions against mixed race people, who are \\"not black enough\\".<br /><br />Mda does an excellent job of bringing diverse individuals to life. We see them from different angles, we empathize with them and comprehend them as part of a larger reality being is being played out.  Nothing is black and white (excuse the pun!), nobody is all \\"good\\" or all \\"bad\\". Mda acknowledges that Afrikaners maintain their dreams of returning to power and depicts realistically the political conflicts within the black leadership.  He introduces two kinds of observers to the novel: Father Claerhout, the Belgian priest-artist living in the region and a knowledgeable \\"we\\" narrator.  The \\"trinity\\" (man, Father, painter), as the Father is referred to, is fascinated by black \\"madonnas\\" who sit for him in all their nude loveliness and grace. Niki becomes a preferred subject, mainly because of beautiful young Popi.<br /><br />The chapters open with the description of one of the trinity's paintings.  They create an imaginary world with blue or purple madonnas in lush robes or naked, sitting in yellow corn fields, among surreal bright sunflowers or surrounded by pink and white star like blossoms. The child of the heavy-set full-breasted Madonna is of a lighter shade of brown and with delicate features.  Sometimes other elements are added, creating portraits of life in the rural community. Semi-abstract and dreamlike, the paintings are reminiscent of van Gogh.  They are always a lead in to the chapter and often the protagonists literally walk off the canvas. The transition between bold imagination and reality is fluid. We, the reader, follow with curiosity and emotion. Tocomplement the trinity's visions,  the \\"we\\" observer steps in to reflect on people and events.  Assumed to be witnesses of Popi's generation, they follow her closely and comment in particular on the attention and mixed feelings she draws in the community. Sometimes critics, sometimes voyeurs, they establish the connections between the paintings and the reality of this microcosm that represents South Africa.<br /><br />Mda's novel is wide-ranging and multifaceted. While it moves fast through time and events, it allows pauses to ponder scenes and portraits of life and invites reflection of decisive historical events in modern South Africa. You will come away enriched and keen to read more by this remarkable author.  [Friederike Knabe]emotion.

The brevity of the text doesn't diminish its impact. I came across it by chance, highly recommended by a friend.  Once started, it turned out to be almost impossible to put down. After the last page of this peculiar \\"last will and testament\\" of the young protagonist the emotions lingered on.  Frequently addressing the reader directly, he explains why this confession was written at all, and in haste, why there was \\"no possibility to reread\\" what was written earlier. The narrative talks about secrets and strange happenings, cross-references to points and events to be elucidated later and explaining uncommon terms. \\"It's a pretty word, rememory, I don't know if it actually exists, but it means to recall things.\\"  Distance is measured in \\"legs\\", time in \\"moons\\" and the watch used by the brother has no hands.<br /><br />Two siblings, brothers for all they know, live with their domineering father on a large isolated estate \\"beyond the pine grove\\". They are forbidden any contact with the outside world.  They see nobody other than five neighbours who appear from time to time to meet with their father. The two have created their own world - somewhere between reality and fantasy. Their only toy is a frog which they captured and feed with dead flies.  Their education is founded on \\"dictionaries\\" held in the vast library: biblical texts, Spinoza and other classics.  The narrator is the \\"secretarious\\" whose responsibility is to record everything that is happening. The language they have learned reflects their readings. Their interpretation of concepts is based on what they have been able to grasp from the dictionaries and the father's instructions.  The father, a priest at a young age, has his own reasons for the strict discipline extending to himself as well as to his offspring.  The story begins with the siblings finding the father dead one morning. One of the two has to gather the courage to venture to the nearby village to get a \\"grave box\\". The exposure to the outside world is a complete shock and results in a series of dramatic events that will overwhelm the young people's lives forever.<br /><br />It is difficult to describe the suspense that Soucy is creating with the use of weird language and the often surreal imagery of the protagonist.  We learn about the woodshed named the \\"vault\\" and the \\"Fair Punishment\\" that is living there... The portrait gallery and the \\"ball room\\" carry their own memories, reflected through murmurs of past splendour and laughter or through images visible in the broken, milky mirrors lining the wall.  While the mystery thickens around the siblings as the reader gets drawn into the story, it unravels in bits and pieces continuously at the same time. Clues are dropped and hints provided that enable putting together the bizarre and otherworldly life story of this odd family. A very unusual book that has won deserved praise in Quebec, France and around the world in its English translation.  [Friederike Knabe]he nearby village to get a \\"grave box\\".

You keep all your mental and intellectual capacities, even your emotional ones. You can still identify your \\"self\\". All this is achieved by having your mind \\"uploaded\\" into a perfect body of chosen age and live happily ever after.  You have become a Mindscan.  Not, so fast, though! What about your consciousness, your \\"soul\\"?  Can it really be copied? And what is going to happen to the original biological self?  What about the reactions of family and friends; how do they take this technological wonderwork?<br /><br />What drives people to take this extreme step?  The two protagonists make this choice for different reasons.  Karen Bessarian, a highly successful writer in her eighties, doesn't accept the fast approaching end of her life.  She has more books to write and life to enjoy, so she chooses a younger body.  Jake, the rich forty-something heir to a Canadian brewery, carries his father's genetic marker for a brain defect.  The older Sullivan collapsed into a vegetative state after a row between father and son when Jake was 17.  Jake had put his life on hold to avoid stress and other triggers for brain damage.  Meeting at a sales event for the Mindscan technology, Karen and Jake develop their relationship in different ways - as biological selves and as mind \\"instantiations\\" with new perfect bodies.<br /><br />Once the \\"uploads\\" have passed their first examinations they are let loose on their family and community with varying results. Tongue in cheek, Sawyer cannot resist some small political stabs contrasting US society at the time [as projected from present conditions] with an increasingly broadminded and left-leaning Canadian one.  Jake doesn't fare well as an uploaded new self. His mother refuses to accept his new identity, his love doesn't even look at him.  Sawyer presents a realistic scenario for his exploration of the reaction of the \\"loved ones\\" resulting in most of the story playing out in and around a US court room.  Karen's son, expecting a rich inheritance, challenges the \\"thing\\" that has taken over from her. \\"I don't care whether copied consciousnesses are in fact persons in their own right. The issue is whether they are the same person as the original.\\"  His lawyer, of course, argues that \\"it\\" is not and brings various scientists as witnesses. The other side also has ample expertise on its side and a lot riding on success.<br /><br />Sawyer has created an intriguing speculative fiction world some 40 years hence where mind scans are possible. In his version of 2045, the technology for cloning humans has not been mastered. Instead, the brain is copied - completely and accurately - in a moment of \\"quantal entanglement\\" of the biological brain.  The process  creates a quantum fog that congeals into one artificial replacement brain. The new \\"you\\" takes over from that point.  To avoid the problems of sudden doubles or clones, the original, now a \\"shed skin\\", has to disappear.  Conveniently, lunar explorations have advanced so that a retirement home can provide for the cast-offs - most of whom are old and expect to die within a short span of time anyway.  They are mostly rich and content with their lot. Given the costs involved in the whole process, overcrowding is not a problem and any luxury desired can be provided. However, Jake is not finished with earth life yet...<br /><br />The subject of consciousness and individual self is not a new one for Sawyer. This time, though, he has expanded the complexities beyond what he did, for example, in Factoring Humanity.  Using the present-day hot debates around new findings in brain research and the challenges they pose to our understanding of human individuality and functioning into the near future, he confronts our perceptions and belief systems.  This opens a new dimension for the philosophical/scientific debate on humanconsciousness and identity.  Professionals as well as interested laypersons grapple with the dividing line between neuron pathways as a result of biochemical reactions and brain functions as expression of thought, argument or emotion, the \\"soul\\".<br /><br />Mindscan, while deeply philosophical, is an absorbing, well written and highly enjoyable story. Current scientific research and its impact on our future societies are front and centre of this novel, yet, it doesn't overwhelm the reader and moves easily along with the narrative's flow.  Sawyer has created a complex and very human tale of individuals thriving for their own, unique, personally fulfilling lives.

His book follows in the footsteps of famous explorers of the Sahara/Sahel in centuries past, starting with Ibn Battuta and Leo Africanus to Mungo Park and Heinrich Barth.  Tayler deserves an honoured place among them.<br /><br />An experienced traveler in difficult terrains, as described in previous books, he set himself an unusually challenging itinerary.  He trekked mainly through remote rural areas at the southern edge of the Sahara, relying on local transport and local people for assistance in his quest. The two-month excursion took place in early 2003 (prior to the invasion of Iraq) but the shadow of 9/11 confronted him everywhere, with varying degrees of vehemence.  One of his objectives, in fact, had been to explore the reactions of local people to the conflicts between his home country, USA, and this part of Africa that is predominantly Muslim. He wanted to hear their concerns and how they judged American politics and treated an American in their midst. His fluency in Arabic and French as well as familiarity with Arab and West African Muslim cultures were essential preconditions for this adventure.<br /><br />And it was an adventure in all respects: threat of bandits, lack of safe food and water, breaking down vehicles, military and border bureaucrats' attempts to block his way.  He followed far-flung desert tracks into regions foreigner had rarely ventured to enter. Chad is not on tourist maps, nor is the northern region of Nigeria. Neither is Niger, the second poorest country in the world. Traveling on the Niger River in a local \\"pinasse\\" from Gao to Timbuktu presented its own challenges. Arriving finally in Timbuktu he is rewarded with a beautifully conveyed visit to celebrate the \\"Feast of Tabaski\\" with a Tuareg family an hour's camel ride away in the desert.<br /><br />More than once was he worried about survival and safe return. Quite deliberately he immersed himself in the local habitat and routines. He shared many of the hardships of the local people whose poverty, hopelessness and sometimes anger he describes in detail with deep empathy and understanding.  His skill of observation brings the villages and the people to life.  His portrayal of the beauty of the Sahelian landscape despite the challenges of its harsh climate are superb, his language often lyrical. The \\"harmattan\\", the hot and destructive desert wind, made life difficult for animals and humans.  His real \\"saviours\\", however, were his numerous local travel companions and guides as well as village chiefs and other people encountered.  He records political and philosophical discussions with them and reflects on their personalities and surroundings. Sometimes, it is only with a sense of humour and patience that issues get resolved.  It became evident to Tayler, that even in the remotest oases of Chad or Niger, the local people were well aware of the major crisis between the United States and Muslim states; they voiced their concerns of the US administration and the impending war with Iraq. \\"We always liked the Americans before\\" one chief is quoted, \\"but not now\\".  Many interlocutors saw a clear distinction between an American among them and his government's politics. \\"You are safe here\\", one of them responded as he imagined the wrath of US on his country if anything happened to their visitor.<br /><br />The book is rich in detail and full of fascinating facts. Tayler touches on diverse tensions and conflicts, whether religious or ethnic, internal to the nations he visited, illustrating the dilemmas of the ill-advised post colonial boundaries. Given the distances he traveled, the places he visited and the people he encountered, the book could easily have been double in length.  The expansion would not lose the reader's attention.<br /><br />What makes this book particularly valuable is Tayler's solid knowledge of the long and complex history underlying the socio-political context of the region. Historical information and relevant current data is brought into the flow of the reporting, adding important background information without overloading the narrative. No doubt this is a captivating read and invaluable for anybody wanting to learn more about this fascinating and least explored African region.

Consider it as pure entertainment; for the political intrigue and thrill; or as a virtual door into a foreign place, the lives of far away people, their time or preoccupations.<br /><br />Pamuk has attempted to present us with all three options in one. The reader is exposed to a panoramic view of Turkey's political and religious conflicts and ethnic tensions. His multitude of characters represents every conceivable strand of Turkish society: Atat&uuml;rk secularism and pro-European modernism on the one hand and various religious factions of Muslim faith on the other.  By compressing the events into one locale, a remote, poor and backward town, Kars, in Eastern Turkey, he creates a charged playing field. A major snowstorm has cut off the access roads to the town, bringing the conflicting positions to boiling point. A couple of murders occur.  The mayoral election, which would have been won by an Islamist over a local Secularist, is cut short by a military coup. In addition, the town has become notorious in the Istanbul headlines for several suicides and suicide attempts by the so-called \\"headscarf girls\\". The assumption being that the girls decided to end their life because they were not allowed to wear their headscarf in school.  Yet, their motivations are more complicated than that.<br /><br />Within this complex political turmoil, wanders Ka, the protagonist of the story. A recently unproductive poet, he returned from Germany to attend his mother's funeral. He has also reasons for coming to Kars. Presenting himself as a journalist, he claims to be interested in the stories behind the headscarf girls' suicides. On a personal level, he wants to find a \\"Turkish girl\\" to marry and take back to Germany. The object of his dreams and desire is Ipek, a young woman he admired during their student days and who now lives in Kars.<br /><br />The story is told by Orhan, a close friend of Ka, four years after the events in Kars. Orhan travels to the town to retrace Ka's steps, to find his notebook with the poems and also to shed light on the political dramas of the day. In many ways he describes Ka as a somewhat confused, middle-aged man, whose exposure to the realities of Kars result in his questioning his life so far. He is taking in all political and religious positions, getting increasingly entangled as events unfold. Wanting to please his various interlocutors, he appears to flip-flop his own positions.  In discussions with religious leaders he even wavers in his secular beliefs and appears to be overwhelmed by a sudden spurt of poems that come to him as through some \\"divine channel\\".<br /><br />While going into minute, sometimes tedious, detail in defining time and place, the activities are increasingly repetitive and predictable. The characters, despite being given ample dialogue are not convincing and the rationale for some of their actions seems almost farcical.  The newspaper editor who pre-empts the next day's news headlines, the theatre director/actor and his belly-dancing companion who play leading roles in the secularist movement. Nobody is quite what they want or appear to be. The women, in particular, despite their importance for Ka, are hollow. His love for Ipek is not based in reality but rather on his daydreams, both past and future. Her beauty is praised constantly, but nothing much of her character is revealed.<br /><br />Pamuk himself described \\"Snow\\" as a political novel. Is it convincing in that ambition? For the reader who is not that familiar with Turkey or its language, it is difficult to judge its value in this category. My own interpretation is that Pamuk created a satire on Turkey and its historical and present-day problems.  The exaggeration in the description of Kars, political intrigues, religious fanaticism, military brutality, and Ka's own personality would lead to that assessment.<br /><br />The narrator, Orhan, interjects his own 20-20-hindsight vision of Ka in his interactions with the other protagonists of the story. Several times, he addresses the reader directly and, halfway through the book, reveals what happens to Ka after his return to Germany. An all-knowing narrator can be an effective technique in a story, but it is not very successful here.  Rather than complementing the reader's understanding, Orhan competes with his friend for their attention.  The result is a strange mix of over-detailed reporting on the events and circumstances in Kars during the snow storm and very generalized, almost philosophical commentary on love, poetry, happiness in which the character Ka is embedded.

Is in their genes or do experiences of early childhood create this urge to be on the move? For Kira Salak, these and other questions form the backdrop to her kayak trips into out-of-the-way places such as Borneo, Mozambique or Papa New Guinea.  The trips allow her to \\"unearth parts of myself that I've long since buried as dead... They are, in many respects, processes of rebirth.\\"<br /><br />The 600 miles solo kayak trip on the Niger River in Mali, West Africa - from Segou to Timbuktu - stands out for her as the \\"cruellest journey\\" she has undertaken so far. Some people have called her crazy to attempt this project and, at times, she wonders about it herself.  But the drive to finish the challenge and to see the fabled city at the edge of the Sahara provides her with levels of endurance and strengths that are difficult to imagine. She lives off what she can pack into her little red kayak. She has to rely on villagers along the way for food and shelter... The obstacles are enormous. Traveling the Niger is hazardous even to the locals - and their long dugout boats are better designed to cope with the changes in currents and wind patterns, hippos and more. Then, traveling as a white woman alone in a country full of traditions that don't take necessarily kindly to Western tourists, least to a single boat-woman. \\"Tu-bab! Cadeau!\\" (White! Present!) follows her like a constant echo, the intonation and accompanying gestures reflecting the level of kindness or hostility.<br /><br />Still, Kira faces each hindrance with skill, sometimes luck, and an increasing sensitivity for what is safe and what is not.  Her description of the adventure makes fascinating reading, her fluid style engaging.  We follow her daily paddling routine, her reflections and self-analysis during slow periods in the midday sun and heat on the water, and her observations of her surroundings. Also, we discover with her glimpses of the different peoples who eke out a living in villages along the mighty river. Her reception by the villagers varies enormously. Some offer food and shelter with a smile, in others she depends on the village chief to provide protection - and in still other villages she repacks her kayak as fast as she can to escape.  The different ethnic groups sharing the land along the river vary in the treatment of Tubabs and single women in particular.<br /><br />Two hundred years ago Mungo Park undertook his travels into the interior of West Africa. On his second attempt to reach the end of the Niger, he did make it to Timbuktu and beyond, but did not survive to fulfill his goal.  Salak has studied Park's journals and follows his advice closely. He is her only companion and her travel guide.  Reading \\"some books\\" about Mali prior to travelling, she admits that she was not well prepared for what she encountered. This is probably the major weakness of the book.<br /><br />While adventure travel books are not intended to give in-depth information on the region or country, once the author presents facts and generalized analysis, we expect solid grounding.  For this book, it would have been advisable to complement Mungo Park with some solid research on Mali by approaching some of the many experts around.  As somebody who spent time in Mali and has visited many of the places on her route, though not by boat, I was interested in her descriptions of her encounters with people. Nevertheless, some sweeping statements were not appropriate and some of her conclusions misleading. For example, the pile of rubble, suggested by a passer-by as the spot of the National Museum in Bamako, the capital, suggests to her a country \\"still struggling to find its footing amid the idealism and corruption of post-independence days\\".  In fact, the Museum, established in colonial times, has remained to this day a jewel among museums with extensive collections from pre-historic to modern times.<br /><br />A sense of history and cultural pride is visible all over Mali, in particular among the Dogon people. While there are black market traders selling off artefacts, a deeper exposure to the culture would have informed Salak of the efforts, in particular by women, to preserve and collect them in their community centres.  Women are generally depicted as passively accepting their role in life as subservient and second-class. This may look this way to the superficial observer - it does not represent the underlying reality of many women in Mali.  A better understanding of the societal complexities of this country, rich in history and traditions, would have protected the author from some disappointments and ill-advised initiatives, such as the attempt to buy the freedom of two Bella \\"slaves\\".<br /><br />Despite these weaknesses, the story is a fascinating read and an absorbing account of endurance and pleasure of discovery.  It is helpful to complement the reading with a visit to the photo collection on the website of National Geographic Adventures. Unfortunately, Salak does not provide a reading list to pursue the discovery of the various topics that she touches on.  Further reading on Mali, starting with the numerous websites on the country, its history and cultures, or its famous music and musicians, will be valuable and enriching.

Further reading on Mali, starting with the numerous websites on the country, its history and cultures, or its famous music and musicians, will be valuable and enriching.

They may not appear at a Live 8 concert, but when approached they can be just as generous. The result of one such approach is this highly enjoyable collection of \\"tales\\" told by well known authors from around the world. Nadine Gordimer, the initiator of the project, and 20 authors have donated a story each. The publishers, translators and designers have waived their fees and profits. The book was published simultaneously in several languages. All proceeds will go to HIV/AIDS education and treatment in South Africa.<br /><br />This in itself would be enough reason to buy and look at this book! Yet, there are more grounds for spending your money on it. The stories, selected by the authors themselves, reflect some of the best of each author's writing. They convey diverse personal outlooks or describe real or imagined life experiences. We find John Updike next to Arthur Miller, Paul Theroux and Gabriel Garcia Marquez together with Amos Oz and G&uuml;nter Grass... Several less known African authors, such as Njabulo Ndebele, share a spot with well known Nigerian author Chinua Achebe. In its totality, we have been offered a smorgasbord of excellent story-telling.  It's a partial who's who of current world literature.  The topics presented are as wide ranging as the authors' backgrounds and perspectives. Some are serious, some are funny or satirical. All excel in style and expression. This anthology is one to treasure, to pick up from time to time to read or revisit one of the authors. The ideal gift for yourself and others who enjoy a glimpse into the writing of some of the world's literary greats.  [Friederike Knabe]	2005-07-13

Who can you trust?  What is truth? On which side is the other? Who is the enemy, yesterday, today and tomorrow?  In this latest endeavor to explore the spy thriller genre beyond the cold war, Le Carre explores these and other questions.  First of all, this is the story of two unlikely friends: one English, with a strong colonial background, the other German, with an East German background.  They first meet in Berlin during the late 60s student rebellion. From then on they get drawn together by circumstance or design over years and decades after, until ...<br /><br />The story's centre is Ted Mundy, an unidentified narrator follows him and seems to view the world more or less from the same perspective.  Mundy's on and off reflections of his increasingly complicated life expose him as an accidental spy. He feels like he's having multiple personalities. Drawn by a sense of responsibility toward his student friend, he gets enmeshed deeper and deeper in political intrigues even long after the Berlin Wall comes down. Why does he continue despite the alternative of a fresh start and a small piece of personal happiness?  Does he have a real choice?<br /><br />Sasha, his friend and German counterpart, incorporates traits of young German rebels of the day. He also typifies a certain type of former East German refugee in the West who is torn between dream and reality: anti-west as well as anti-east. The question keeps arising whether he has any real moral standing or is a floater, a prime candidate for the double agent. Several other players who stand out in their respective roles surround the two main characters. There are several attractive women, of course, and English and American spymasters. While all are a bit shady, the \\"honest\\" spymaster remains, not surprisingly, the Brit.<br /><br />Le Carre knows how to draw people and create situations.  His description of life in a student commune in Berlin of the time is brilliant in its accuracy and atmospheric depiction. Ted's childhood in India, then Pakistan, is conveyed through images that explain its influence on him, his ongoing nostalgia for the place and the people. A major strength of the book is these images and the characterization of Mundy as a result of all his experiences.  Being familiar with the events of the time, especially in Berlin, I was captured by the story.  For me Absolute Friends is more than a spy thriller - the core thriller only starts more than halfway through the story.  While the first half is a build up of the two main characters for the later events, it also sets the stage for the ongoing exploration of friendships and the complexities of human relations.  The final drama of the book has led to criticism of Le Carre.  However, while unlikely in reality, within the context of the story it was a logical conclusion.<br /><br />Absolute Friends has attracted friends and foes. Those interested in the European scene up to and beyond the fall of the Berlin Wall will find the story especially interesting. Those looking for the traditional spy thriller may be disappointed in the length it dedicates to the characters and their interactions.

For the western reader it will be difficult, if not impossible, to visualize the utter remoteness of a Siberian village lost in the vast plains of the taiga. Life is completely controlled by nature - winters last seven months or more. Before leaving the land and the people to recover in a short spring, winter hits with another vicious snowstorm. Only the houses' chimneys are seen protruding in the expanse of white. Digging out a path is like hollowing out a deep tunnel back to the surface.  Makine's intricate portrayal of the land's extraordinary beauty, whether under snow or during the spring thaw, reveals his deep connection to nature and his Siberian past. It is a backdrop and, almost, a participant in this engaging story.<br /><br />First of all, though, this is a growing-up story of three local boys: Dmitri, the narrator, and his friends Utkin and Samurai. For them \\"the beauty of the land was the least of the preoccupations in the land where we were born...\\" It was taken for granted. Still, the reader senses the equilibrium between the boys and their natural environment. A vivid account of their thrill at swimming in the icy cold current of the Olyei River and being confronted with unwelcome onlookers. Taking a steam sauna in a remote bath hut in the forest reflects their intimacy and happiness at being friends.<br /><br />Daily life is also controlled by the political powers: the story is anchored in the early 1970s and Soviet rule dominates all aspects of it. Their village, having played an important role in the past and during the war, it is now only a shadow of itself: controlled by \\"gold, the gulag, and the taiga\\".  The boys accept their reality while dreaming of a different world beyond their community on the shores of the Amour River and inhospitable Siberia. The Trans-Siberian train speeding by in the night symbolizes the wider world, the link between Occident and Orient.<br /><br />For the three teenage friends, growing up also includes an increasing awareness of sexuality and curiosity for women and love. Eroticism and sensuality, let alone \\"love\\", had never been part of the local people's vocabulary, going back to the village's founding some 300 years ago by Cossacks.  Carving out an existence has always been rough and challenging.  Now, any sense of reality or knowledge of the outside world was filtered through Soviet-style propaganda: reaching or surpassing the monthly quotas; winning whatever battle was being fought. Women and men were, above all, socialist partners with a mission to fulfill the expectations of the system.  For boys, eager to explore their blossoming feelings, this was not a good introduction.<br /><br />Into this bleak and harsh reality \\"strolls\\" Jean-Paul Belmondo, charming, easy-going and successful ... and the boys and the villagers are changed forever: Belmondo appears on screen in the cinema \\"Red October\\". The impact could not have been more dramatic if he had come in person. The political slogan banners at the Politburo pale in comparison to his big poster in the main village square.  His comedies, the first one in particular, stir the imagination of the boys. He represents a life in the \\"Occident\\" that is fantastic as it is alien.  There, people have an easy time, life is rich, and the hero usually wins the girl.  For the villagers, it is impossible to distinguish between fiction and reality. Through many repeat visits Dmitri and his friends slowly understand the story line. Each scene, every small item is analyzed and interpreted as authentic reflection of life in the West.  The boys increasingly live an alternative reality - they visualize Paris, Venice and more. The West has met the East.<br /><br />Makine's portrayal of the boys, their emotions and experiences of growing up is beautifully presented. There is Olga, Samurai's Francophile older friend, who introduces the boys to French literature and culture; there is Utkin's grandfather and Dmitri's aunt. They all come to life and round off the picture. Humour and irony balance the serious exploration of the challenges faced by young people living in remote places like Siberia and with ambitions to change their lives. They feel torn between Occident and Orient, between the unknown and the familiar worlds.  Despite their different personalities and ambitions, they each have to choose their future direction.<br /><br />Similarly to other Makine books, the story is embedded in a short narrative set decades later in New York.  It sets a frame and also allows for reflection of the lives lived.  Once Upon the River Love is very rich novel. It is specific in its captivating detail of land and people while at the same time raising pertinent general issues of fiction versus fact, imagination versus action and the role of these in forming young people's minds everywhere.  I read the novel in the original French and was captivated by the exquisite style and richness of language. The emotional depth of the story reveals the Russian roots of the author.

Where no Banker has gone before...<br /><br />Timing is an important element in the publication success of a book.  Here, the intention is twofold.  On the one hand Mallaby reviews the ten-year trials and tribulations of the World Bank's outgoing president, Jim Wolfensohn. On the other, he aims to provide a critical overview of the broader world and historical context in which the World Bank has been operating since its beginnings 60 years ago.  While the period prior to Wolfensohn is not accorded the same detail, it is nevertheless treated as an important background to understand the Wolfensohn era.  The author concludes with a few recommendations for the incoming President.<br /><br />As a biography of Jim Wolfensohn, the book is a success and a good read.  It's full of personal stories, gossip and astute observations. Based on extensive interviews with Wolfensohn, other World Bankers and many friends and observers, the author reveals traits of the man that few would know outside the inner circle of friends and some of his business partners.  He is ambitious and driven by his search for accomplishments and adoration, yet his visions are not necessarily backed up by clear strategies and implementation methods. He is a banker, not a development professional. He is also a philanthropist and a musician. Mallaby vividly paints the personality with all his strengths and weaknesses: the duality of a kind of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of development banking. His term at the Bank has resulted in many new ideas, some false starts, and some long-term successes, Mallaby contends. But the route to achieve those was difficult and often confrontational. It was frustrating him and draining on his management team and staff, not to speak of his board.  In real terms, Wolfensohn shook up the World Bank system - with reason - and overall the Bank is a better place for it: it is more focused on poverty alleviation, works more closely with the borrowing countries and has managed to keep the rich lending governments, more or less, on side.<br /><br />Biographers often take the side of their subject.  Events and people are seen through a close-up lens and objectivity is of lesser importance. This is very much the case here.  Mallaby's lens is not only focused on Wolfensohn and the World Bank, he uses a fish-eye lens where anything beyond the focus tends to get distorted or blurred. His bias shows strongly in his repeated, yet generalized, criticism of NGOs, his belittling of the UN Millennium Development Goals and of the UN agencies' capacity to deliver development programs. While it is understandable that details are omitted and development policies and case studies cannot be discussed in depth and breadth, judgemental statements that are not substantiated create uneasiness in the reader.  For example, NGOs are criticized for not embracing the World Bank's new Water Strategy in 2002 without the author giving any indication of its substance or the reasons why NGOs did not want to buy into it.  He laments that NGOs, or \\"No-Gos\\", don't have an \\"off-switch\\". \\"Participatory\\" consultations appear to be described as successful only when the groups consulted agree with the World Bank policy in the end. He almost feels sorry for Wolfensohn in his efforts to reach out to such groups. Finally, Mallaby's condescending comments on Joe Stiglitz reflect more than journalistic arrogance.<br /><br />The question arises about the intended audience(s) for this book.  People interested in fascinating, colourful personalities will find the person at the centre of this story worth their while. The development professionals, such as myself, will read with interest about the internal World Bank struggles during Wolfensohn's reign. They can easily balance the biases and fill in the source gaps from their own knowledge base. However, the general reader might be well advised to consult additional material on development strategies and country programs and accept this journalist/biographer's views with a pinch of salt.

US	51245884	R34SOH52AGIWB7	061823649X	865354621	Spoken Here: Travels Among Threatened Languages	Books	4	22	23	N	N	loving language diversity	Have you ever wondered how you would react if *your* language was threatened with extinction?  Would you miss it at all? What more would you lose than words and phrases? Mark Abley tracked the world for 10 years to pursue these and related questions. His discoveries make for an intriguing read spiked with some learning about local tongues like Boro, Yuchi, Proven√ßal or Manx.<br /><br />Language is used to express the worldview of its speakers, bur does it also shape and influence it?  Are the connotations that a word's meaning carries consciously passed on?  Many traditional languages have in common that they are more complicated in their grammar than modern ones. Some prescribe human kinships in great detail and maintain a different vocabulary for each gender to use.  Does these aspects have a bearing on the human interrelationships?  The author pursues the answers from the elders, language teachers and linguistic experts.  Of particular interest to him are languages that structure sentences around verbs rather than nouns, as we are used to. Placing the \\"action\\" in the centre of a phrase results in a different perspective on life, he argues, making it more inclusive of the surroundings and reducing the primary role of the self.  The Boro language, spoken in northern India, has one-verb expressions that require full sentences when translated into English: \\"gagrom\\", for example, means \\"to search for a thing below the water by trampling\\" or \\"mokhrob\\" - to express anger by a sidelong glance.  Mohawk must be one of the most complex languages in its use of verbs. In addition to describing the action \\"a verb must indicate the agent, recipient and the time of the action\\". There are other elements to consider too, such as the relationships to be expressed or whether it is one-time or habitual; all these components are represented in a series of pre- and suffixes.<br /><br />Another aspect of the diversity of language that captivates the author, is the naming of objects, like the three or more distinct names for \\"blue-tongue lizard\\" in Wangkajunga, an Australian Aborigine language. Nobody seems to knows how they differ from each other. Abley discusses with a Mohawk elder the meaning of the central concepts of Iroquois law: peace, power and righteousness.  All three have complex connotations that for non-speakers require detailed explanations. The last concept, for example, can also mean \\"beautiful\\" or \\"good\\" as well as \\"righteousness\\". This is but one example that underscores a unique worldview of its speakers that is influenced by language. In turn, the speakers' perspective continues to influence the evolving language.  Some languages are flexible and adjust, developing terms reflecting modern life. Still, others are helpless in this regard and are overrun by the majority language or the universal language, English, the \\"Walmart\\" of communication.<br /><br />While Abley discusses certain linguistic aspects of the selected languages in some detail, Spoken Here is primarily a human interest story and quite removed from dry technical linguistics. The author describes his travels to interesting places, his meetings with scientists and researchers. He commends their work on recording a local threatened language and marvels with them at the grammatical intricacies of another.  His primary interest are the individuals who attempt to save or rekindle their (grand)parents' tongues.  He describes their surroundings, their community and profiles them with their aspirations and dreams.  Through him, we meet elders who recall a time when their language was alive and well.  Most activists feel that their language is a vital part of their identity that is worth saving. Others, often the younger people, feel motivated to pick theirs up, almost like a new hobby.<br /><br />Will the threatened languages survive? Some will, he argues, and gives Manx, Welsh and Mohawk as examples. Political reasons, the ambition to restore some autonomy from a strong neighbour, play an important part in the efforts to rekindle a local language. He compares language diversity with biological diversity of plants and animals. Both are in danger of being eroded or destroyed. The world will be a poorer place without them.<br /><br />Abley's account of his encounters make an enjoyable read. His selection of places he visited and languages to explore was to a degree arbitrary and sometimes coincidental, such as the discovery of Boro. He pursued leads from people and from respective studies that intrigued him. At times the reader might lose interest in a particularly detailed description of political events surrounding an endangered language issue.  Africa, a continent extremely rich in traditional and threatened local languages, was unfortunately not on his travel routes.  Experiences there might well have enriched the author's perspectives and deepened the readers' exposure to the challenges and opportunities of Africa's extraordinary diversity.

It is a story of extraordinary emotional intensity. For anybody like me with interest in the Russian \\"condition humaine\\", this is a must read.  While written as fiction, it depicts realities and truths of lives lived during Soviet times and since.  Makine, born and brought up in Russia, emigrated to France in 1987 and writes his novels in French.  He has found an excellent translator in Geoffrey Strachan.<br /><br />Requiem is anchored in the narrator, the last of three generations of one family.  Makine weaves the description of the father's and grandfather's lives into the son's narrative.  It is a story within and told as conveyed to him by a third party.  This technique establishes a lens singling out or highlighting specific details and events. At the same time the method creates a certain emotional distance for both the protagonist and the reader from the vicious excesses of the Soviet regime and the horrors of war. In stark contrast to the depiction of devastation, scorched earth and expanding killing fields, is the description of nature and landscapes in all their beauty and harmony.  There is something nostalgic and even surreal in the soothing power that the land and rural life has over the father and grandfather. It is a refuge sought from the fighting that restores and gives life. It is the dream that sustains the soldier and keeps him alive against all odds. Happiness and love, even if short-lived are possible and experienced here.<br /><br />The unnamed narrator was severed from this nourishing power, his sense of identity lost since early childhood, his \\"own memories falsified from birth\\". Rescued by an enigmatic family friend just prior to the killing of his parents, he grows up as an orphan.  The sense of being an outsider never leaves him. Working as a medical doctor in African countries he moves from crisis to crisis. An offer to join the KGB comes almost as relief; changing identities as required for his life as a spy is the easiest part. He is thrown back into the African quagmire, caught between the Cold War's competing fronts. With a few brush strokes, Makine captures the essence of the increasingly perilous political games being played out in developing countries.  The \\"game of espionage\\" brings the agent and his female partner closer together. While his feelings for her grow deeper, his outlook on life is put to the test: \\"To be able to tell the truth one day.\\"  This is her wish to which he responds by telling her his family's story as conveyed to him by the old friend years ago.<br /><br />The story of Nikolai, the grandfather, and his son Pavel portrays two generations of soldiers caught up in the brutalities of the two major wars and the rise of Stalin. The growing violence of the Soviet regime is illustrated through specific episodes and incidents. Nikolai, fighting with the Red Army, rides off one day from the combat not too far from his home, yearning for peace on his land. Pavel joined the Soviet army to battle the Germans in World War II. He ends up in a penal company - canon fodder at the frontlines. The narrative of the fighting, the loss of comrades and Pavel's endurance is harrowing in its vivid detail. Most haunting is the image of an attempt to free a concentration camp with German snipers still hiding between the barracks. Pavel survives the war only to find \\"home\\" destroyed. Completely rudderless and troubled by the nightmares of his experiences, he drifts, runs, and hides from the deeply disquieting postwar Soviet reality in a remote area in the Caucasus.<br /><br />Makine has an extraordinary talent to create a dramatic framework for his story while directing the reader toward concrete specific events. Nikolai, after deserting from the Red Army, has to confront the local Soviet officials who have been forcing individual farmers to accept the collectivization of theirfarms. Having observed what happened to his neighbours, Nikolai turns the rationale upside down. His farm tools and his old horse are in such poor condition, he argues, that handing them over to the kolkhoz would be equal to sabotage. For Pavel the chances of survival were counted in days, maximum months: the \\"distance that lay between him and death could be measured in the numbers killed\\". There was no point in sharing one's name as the probability of staying alive to the next day was almost nil.<br /><br />The continuation of Pavel's story is the narrator's own story of survival, physically and emotionally.  The end of the Cold War and the subsequent \\"disappearance of the Empire\\" leave him confused and challenge him to establish a new life. He feels the need for an ongoing inner dialogue with his former partner: she becomes the focus of his search for the truth. Finding her comes close to an obsession. The Parisian society crowd that he joins in his quest, speaks mockingly of the Soviet army and of his country, calling it a \\"phantom country\\".  He should react, explain, or contradict the views presented. Yet, he feels unable to intervene, an outside observer, not able to fit in whether it is Moscow or Paris.  Ultimately, his search for answers, his truth and for his peace of mind ends unexpectedly.<br /><br />Makine has created a powerful and profoundly moving portrait of one Russian family set against the dramatic backdrop of the complex realities of  the Soviet era and its collapse. His characters embody real people, individuals with deep emotions showing vigour and endurance in adverse circumstances and surviving on the strength of their roots and connection to their land.

Relaxing after a day's work as No. 1 Ladies' Detective with a cup of bush tea, her mind might wander back to the stories of her childhood.  Those new to McCall Smith's books will find in \\"The Girl Who Married a Lion\\" an excellent introduction into the gentle and caring world of Mma Ramotswe and her friends. The same warmth and affection that McCall Smith conveyed through his Botswana series has found expression in this latest book.  It is a real treasure.<br /><br />Folk tales in any culture, told and retold from one generation to the next, have special meaning within and beyond their geographic beginnings.  They often combine the best of humanity's wisdoms with the local flair of their original source.  Sometimes they are revealing, tongue in cheek irony, usually reflecting on one or the other human weakness or strength.  They end with a gentle lesson in morality and local customs.  The tales in this collection from one particular region of Africa are no different. As in fables everywhere, animals can speak and/or disguise themselves as humans; good and evil spirits test the resolve of the brave and award the deserving.  While we might recognize some themes and characters, such as the hare or the tortoise, in all tales the African context shines through very strongly.  We hear about a colourful bird that gives milk to sustain a poor family.  In another, \\"children of wax\\" shape their restless brother into a bird to help him explore life during the hot sunny day. Or crocodiles that are feeling pity for a young girl too weak to carry the calabashes for the daily water needs of her family.<br /><br />McCall Smith always finds the right tone, the proper nuances and illuminating details to bring the stories alive within their culture and environment.  He has been collecting these tales, told to him over decades while living in Botswana and in what is now Zimbabwe.  His sensitive retelling them for us conveys the local context vividly. Adding some detail on a landscape here or on a different local custom there makes his narratives rich reading.

Rough, deeply scarred hands hardly touching the keys, then hesitating, confusing a note - and the pianist weeps.<br /><br />This chance meeting of two strangers in the night frames like a picture the extraordinary and deeply moving story of Alexe√Ø Berg, the pianist. Alexe√Ø grew up during the years of arbitrary detentions and executions of Stalin's reign of terror. His parents, suspects for a while, seem to have averted the worst. The old violin, played sometimes by a family friend, since executed as a traitor, is thrown into the fire by the father in the hope of avoiding a similar fate.  To Alexe√Ø's ears, the exploding strings make the sound of staccato played on a harp.  This sound is engraved in his memory forever.  Yet, on the eve of his debut concert, their time has run out and he must flee to escape his own certain arrest.  To survive he follows the road west, hides, and, as last resort, takes on a dead soldier's identity. Creating an imagined personality, always conscious of dangers to his double life, he joins \\"his\\" unit on the frontlines in the war against the Germans. Not surprisingly, Alexei's attempts to drown his previous self, that of the high-spirited young pianist on the verge of success in Moscow, only succeeds so far. After the war ends, memories of the past start re-emerging. He can no longer pretend without difficulty. What happened to his parents? Visions of a life not lived lead him to confront his two realities. In the end, it is the piano and the music that heals and at the same time exposes him.  By accepting the consequences of his \\"crime\\" he recovers the connection to his former life and his inner voice of music.<br /><br />Makine does not need many words to convey the intricacies of his hero's experiences.  Using the precise, yet detached, language of an observer, he succeeds in conveying the reality of the Stalin purges, the horrors of war... the challenges of a generation, represented by Alexe√Ø, that is caught in a life beyond its control.  His intention is not to give his readers a grand epic of the man and his time. Rather, like a sculptor crafting a relief, Makine chisels out small pieces, highlighting minute details in some parts and using broad strokes in others to create his masterpiece. It succeeds also by drawing on the reader's understanding of the context, his empathy and power of imagination to visualize what is hinted at but not spelled out.<br /><br />\\"You can never describe the life of another person\\" Makine said in a recent interview, each observer will interpret it based on his own understanding. The \\"perfect novel\\" is beyond description, he asserts, the reader should loose himself in it, observe and contemplate its meaning and, at the end, emerge transformed. Music can have that same quality as it carries the listener beyond the present reality.  With \\"Music of a Life\\" Makine is living up to his own definition.<br /><br />The relative brevity of the story should not be seen as a disadvantage.  On the contrary, this is a highly charged and emotional story. A thin layer of \\"objective\\" reporting by the narrator only obscures for a short time the underlying intensity and the author's deep concerns for his country and its people. This is a treasure of a book, to be read more than once.  This review refers to the original French version. Others have commented on the excellent translation into English.

It was a simple and easily understood concept: those who have more give some of their wealth to those who have less.  Humanitarianism describes this personal level of voluntary aid to lessen the suffering of others, be that as a result of systemic poverty or of natural or man-made disasters.  Unless the humanitarian crisis is close to home, the individual's commitment to help is channeled through a myriad of aid organizations operating in the affected region or country.  Complementing the work of international agencies (UN, Red Cross, NGOs) is the CHARITY OF NATIONS: governments directly engaged with the other players in the \\"humanitarian enterprise\\". However, governments do not operate selflessly.  While, their main responsibility is for the well being of their citizens, they may be very reluctant to have \\"outsiders\\" interfere in their affairs.  In the donor countries foreign policy interests always intrude on their humanitarian response to emergencies. As a result the simple concept of charity has become highly complex in modern times.<br /><br />Smillie and Minear present a thorough and substantial analysis of the multifaceted issues that drive humanitarian assistance. They reflect on the changes in the relief, aid and emergency \\"business\\" since the Cold War. They discuss in some depth the new approach used since 9/11: increasingly, humanitarian demands are being balanced with security concerns. Other novel trends, they explain, are the increasing commercialization of aid delivery and the difficult relationships between military personnel and aid agencies.  The definition of aid agencies as \\"an extension of security forces\\", promoted by the US administration in Afghanistan and Iraq, has exposed humanitarian aid workers to more dangers than ever before.  For many, it has put into question the NGOs' claim for neutrality as they operate among the different sides of the conflict and the essential non-political character of humanitarian aid in all circumstances.  On the other hand, aid agencies have not only become executing agents for official government aid programs, they also rely on the increased security maintained by the military in crisis countries.<br /><br />The authors offer detailed case studies of humanitarian crises, such as Sierra Leone, East Timor and Afghanistan, to exemplify the range of responses by the international players.  They expose the wide ranging difficulties experienced in each scenario.  Summarizing the divergence between assertions and practical applications, they identify systemic problems in the humanitarian enterprise as it is currently implemented. All players, whether governments, UN agencies or NGOs, they each have their own approaches and perspectives, the authors state. They even vary in their definition of the commonly accepted humanitarian principles.  For the recipient governments this multitude of actors is highly confusing. Such confusion, among other reasons, is leading to mistrust and antipathy.  Often it seems that, in particular, the local NGOs are overlooked by the international actors. Those groups, though, \\"for all their weaknesses offer the best long-term hope, also in terms of prevention\\", assert the authors.<br /><br />Three levels of emergencies are being distinguished, with the first level receiving extensive attention and support worldwide, such as Afghanistan, Iraq or the very recent Asian emergency following the tsunami.  The second level is treated with a modest, often  lingering response and describes most of the \\"traditional\\" humanitarian crises.  The third level can also be termed \\"the forgotten\\" disaster or emergency.  Many African crises, whether as a result of natural or man-made disasters, fall into this last category.  Unless the country is strategically important to donor countries or attracts media attention, or is just \\"lucky\\", very little humanitarian assistance and support will beforthcoming.  The authors observe that non-government international aid agencies, themselves dependent on donor contributions in their home country, are also limited in the range and level of support they can offer unless the emergency moves into the media limelight, which the authors term \\"the CNN moment\\". One can name the Ethiopia famine in the 1980s as one such example.<br /><br />The authors criticize the weaknesses of the international humanitarian system that allows such uneven response to human disasters. The right to humanitarian assistance should be consistently and equally applied across the globe. They argue in favour of a new humanitarian crisis management system with a \\"strengthened multilateral core\\" and agreed upon guidelines and principles. Such as system would move towards a new way of financing the response to humanitarian crisis as well as the fundamental next steps of reconstruction and development. They stress that monitoring effectiveness and accountability will have to become essential components of future aid delivery.<br /><br />Smillie's and Minear's study, based on years of research and field work by the authors and the \\"Humanitarianism and War Project\\", extensive interviews with many players from diverse relevant agencies, represents a major contribution to the necessary debate on \\"Humanitarian Action in a Calculating World\\", the subtitle of the book. Despite the difficult and at times technical subject matter, it is written in clear language that is accessible to the interested non-specialist reader. The book is a must for all those engaged at any level with international humanitarian action, policy makers and practitioners. Those concerned with improved systems for sharing resources and expertise between the richer and the poorer countries will find the proposals for increased accountability and monitoring the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance thought provoking and compelling.  Detailed notes, relevant statistics and a selected bibliography assist the further research.

Many books have been written about the topic. Whether in studies, documentaries or fictional accounts, finger-pointing at the perpetrators of the crimes against millions has been part of the process of coming to terms with the Nazi atrocities. For Imre Kertesz, renowned author and Nobel laureate of 2002, there is no other topic. Yet, when he reflects on the traumatic impact of Auschwitz, \\"he dwells on the vitality and creativity of those living today\\" and \\"thus, paradoxically, not on the past but the future.\\" Bernhard Schlink, professor of law and practicing judge in Germany, born in 1944, has attempted to capture the struggles of his generation in confronting the past and the future in \\"The Reader\\".  \\"Pointing at the guilty party did not free us from shame\\", his narrator and protagonist contemplates, \\"but at least it overcame the suffering we went through on account of it\\".<br /><br />The usually unambiguous distinction between villain and victim has facilitated the identification with those who lost their lives or suffered under the Nazi atrocities while all scorn, abhorrence and hate was piled on the perpetrators. Until recently, few books have focused on the after-war generation. While growing up, the children had to come to terms with the, often sudden, exposure of their parents' active or passive participation in the crimes of the Nazi regime.  \\"The Reader\\", set in post-war Germany and against the backdrop of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials of the mid-sixties, takes this new and, for our generations, important angle: in the form of the fictional memoir of Michael Berg. Michael, while not refuting guilt, shame, and atonement, is led to examine and dissect the complexity of inter-generational conflicts in the context of his personal experiences.  Like Schlink himself, he grapples with the fundamental problem of the relationships between these two generations.<br /><br />Michael recounts the most important stages in his life, starting with experiences long passed in his youth.  While his account follows the chronology of events, he progressively interleaves retrospective reflections on his past conduct, questioning his conflicting emotions - his behaviour.  The story starts with Michael's first, secret, love affair at age 15 with a woman more than twice his age. The blossoming erotic relationship strengthens his self-worth and confidence yet, at the same time, increasingly isolating him from his family and peers.  Hanna Schmitz, of whose circumstances and background Michael knew very little, was affectionate and standoffish at the same time, prone to abrupt mood swings. The young lover is completely captivated and eager to please.  He is the \\"Reader\\", in German \\"Vorleser\\" is a person who reads aloud to an audience.  At her insistence he reads his books to her and it becomes an important element of their shared intimacy.  When she disappears one day without any warning, her loss leaves him devastated and scarred for life. He can only seek the reasons in his own actions.  Seeing Hanna again years later and in unanticipated surroundings, triggers a flood of questions about the person he loved and thought he knew. Her behaviour raises many questions and Michael discovers a long secret that puts in doubt the facts as they are exposed.  He also wrestles with himself over his own inaction when confronted with choices.  \\"What would you have done?\\" Although addressed to the judge by the defendant, this question hangs over Michael, as it does over his whole generation.  It encapsulates the primary dilemma of the child-parent generations relationships.  Finally, writing the story of his life, drafting and redrafting it in his head until it is in a publishable form, is seen as a chance for his own recovery and for living his own life.<br /><br />The Reader, while a work of fiction, is deeply anchored in the personal experiences of the author and symbolic for his generation.  His spare and unemotional language underlines the impression of a biographical investigation and is used quite deliberately. The English translation captures the tone and style amazingly well.  Reading this book should not be an \\"easy pleasure\\" as some reviewers have suggested. The Reader covers difficult and complex terrain in a way that it forces the reader to reflect and question their own position long afterwards. Although written directly for a German audience of Schlink's and my generation, the novel, surprisingly, has attracted world-wide attention.  While reviews and reactions among readers are highly diverse and even contradictory, it should be read by as many people as possible and with the care the subject matter deserves.

One can only admire what must be going on in an author's mind to create stories like A HAT FULL OF SKY! Tiffany Aching, young heroine of The WEE FREE MEN, is back capturing the attention of young and older readers alike.  Terry Pratchett has woven a new thread into the Discworld, adding a refreshing, new dimension to the already rich collection of characters, landscapes and goings-on. The Chalk, home of the Achings, is a remote rural region, far away from the bustle of Ank Morpork.  The soft rolling hills, evolved in ancient times from the seas of the ages, are part of an area where reality meets magic...<br /><br />While Tiffany, now 11, has been cautiously applying her special skills, inherited from her much-loved granny, she does not really understand what they mean and how to apply them. It is time to *learn* the witching business properly.  With the help of Miss Tick, the headhunter for young witches, she leaves her beloved Chalk to take up \\"service\\" with an experienced witch, the complex Miss Level. Contrary to common assumptions that young witches might learn to fly on a broomstick or concoct magical potions, Tiffany's new life can only be described as tiresome and tedious... Her chores have more in common with a nurse's training as she follows Miss Level to attend to the old, sick and lonely. While she is much appreciated by their charges, Tiffany has a more challenging time to fit in with her fellow witches' apprentices.  The trials and tribulations of the witches' teenage years are no different from those of \\"normal\\" girls: vanity, jealousy, peer pressure.  Pratchett has a wonderful, sensitive touch when characterizing this motley group.  Tiffany's search and acceptance of her own, real *hat* and the hat itself are wonderful metaphors for her coming of witch-age.<br /><br />Tiffany has several magical talents. With telling herself \\"see me\\" and \\"see me not\\" she can step out of her body to observe her surroundings undetected.  She also has the capacity for \\"third thoughts\\". Those are thoughts that \\"watch the world\\" and \\"think by themselves\\".  They have helped Tiffany in her fight with the Queen of the Fairies in WEE FREE MEN.  But they also can be trouble. Combined, these talents can also prove dangerous.  The Nac Mac Feegle, the funny wild bunch of tiny blue men, a special kind of fairies, are the first to realize that danger is brewing for Tiffany. The hiver, an ancient entity that cannot die and moves from host to host, to absorb their minds, has set its ambitions on Tiffany. She would be an ideal candidate to be taken over... Rob Anybody and his brothers, have a special bond with the young girl, the \\"big wee hag\\".  Their adventures are always hilarious, yet their efforts to protect Tiffany and to reach her before the hiver does is one of those gems that will stay in the mind of the reader.  Mistress Weatherwax, the most revered of the old witches, is well known to Pratchett fans. Here, in her attempt to support and protect Tiffany, new sides of her personality are revealed. The confrontation with the hiver, while unavoidable, develops in unexpected ways.<br /><br />A HAT FULL OF SKY is a delight of a story, for readers with a young mind, whatever their actual age.  As Pratchett fans have come to expect, it is filled with good humour, imaginative witticisms and magic fantasy and, at the same time, with deep understanding and empathy for the foibles of humans and other beings.

Reading Gaiman, \\"gaps\\" take on a much more complex meaning... People can fall through the gaps/cracks, literally, not only down onto the rails but much deeper, ending up in \\"London Below\\".  Richard Mayhew, a young man with nothing much happening in his life, is an unlikely Samaritan.  Still, when confronted with a choice he follows his charitable instinct and assists a wounded rag girl he finds lying in the street. To save her from her apparent killers he goes on a quest and from this moment his life turns into a rollercoaster of discovery and danger.<br /><br />\\"Neverwhere\\" is a brilliant yarn of life in the underbelly of the city, with shady human characters, speaking rats and special \\"guides\\". There is more than one reality for sure. In London Above, Richard and the rag girl, named appropriately \\"Door\\", can be seen but not recalled beyond the moment.  The real-life maze of London underground tunnels, hidden passageways and dead ends provide the existent, yet twisted, backdrop to the story.  Time and distances have no meaning. The names of tube stations acquire new relevance: the Earl resides at Earl's Court, the black Friar monks are in Blackfriars and Islington is an Angel.  Following Door and her unusual companions, Richard discovers the limits of his endurance.  He has to question his existence and reality. While his desire to get back to his normal life keeps him going, his chances to shake loose from the shadowy underworld increasingly appear to diminish...<br /><br />The novel, which expands on Gaiman's successful tv production, is a great read, whether you know London or not (yet).  His style is fluid and engaging, his characters are very much alive and moving the various layers of intrigue along at a good pace.  [Friederike Knabe]	2004-12-05

But will they be enough of a talent to succeed in reviving the moribund postal service of Ankh Morpork?  Moist von Lipwig, aka. Albert Spangler, had run out of luck in his \\"business\\" and was sentenced to death.  And Albert died. Moist, however, was transported to the palace of Lord Vetinari, the city's powerful ruler.  There, he was given a second chance at life in the form of a job with a few strings attached:  Get the ancient postal service working again! Given the decades of accumulated mail filling the Post office and a rather dubious  collection of helpers, this task seems almost insurmountable.<br /><br />To add to his problems, the postal services have been replaced by an ingenious new communication system, based on semaphores and \\"clacks towers\\", a Discworld version of the Internet.  The Grand Trunk Company, created by some shady characters to take over the message sending system, has started to suffer from monopoly symptoms. The Lord is not amused!  Responding to his investors' jitters, company director, Reacher Gilt, has been applying several time-proven capitalist schemes... ever so costly, and not only for the consumers.  If these fail, he is prone to rely less on people skills than force, usually indirectly.  It becomes quickly apparent that Gilt and Moist, competitors at some level, are bound to get into some form of dispute over the postal services... As Moist delves deeper into the intricacies of the Post Office and unearths its many secrets, his resolve becomes  difficult to shake. To find out how the two protagonists match up in their battles, you have to read the book.<br /><br />You can find pearls of wisdom on the human condition or satirical comment on the business affairs of our \\"round\\" world.

French's kind of book about all of Africa. Africa is, after all, a large continent with the greatest diversity in species, ecosystems, peoples, languages and histories.  French does not attempt such a challenge.  His primary focus is the part of Africa that he knows best, Central Africa, and its complex history since independence.  While he draws some general conclusions for Africa, resulting from the colonial carving up of the continent, his concern are the events in \\"the heart of Africa\\".  Given the common misconception that Africa can be regarded as one unitary region, the title \\"A Continent for the Taking\\" strikes me as somewhat unsuitable and the subtitle as misleading. Only a few chapters relate French's travels in other countries, all in West Africa, and almost all struggling with their own post-colonial catastrophes such as Sierra Leone and Liberia.  One notable exception is Mali where recent history has demonstrated that democratic development is possible despite political, environmental challenges and severe poverty of the vast majority of the population. Here, French finds some of hope among the tragedies.<br /><br />French feels privileged for his position given his personal background and family connections in and to the region. As West Africa representative for the New York Times between 1994 and 1998, he traveled extensively in the region. The book records one major political crisis after another: most of those happened to occur in Zaire in the last years of Mobutu's reign.<br /><br />French complements his current affairs coverage with reflections on the impacts of colonial history and political power play during the Cold War.  While he places the responsibility of much of the ongoing crisis in the region at the feet of the former colonial powers, especially Belgian's King Leopold, his outspoken critique is particularly poignant regarding the US and its philosophy of \\"African Solutions for African Problems\\".  Supporting authoritarian strongmen and dictators, he argues, has been more important for American foreign policy than promoting nascent democracy and the protection of human rights. Despite the known brutality and rampant frauds of Mobutu's regime, he was only dropped from the list of \\"acceptable\\" African leaders when another equally ruthless strongman, Laurent Kabila, stood at the gates of Kinshasa, the capital.  French was also a close and disparaging observer of the US welcome for Kabila as the new president.<br /><br />French writes with great empathy and passion for the peoples living in Central Africa, the two Congos, one of them the former Zaire, as well as the displaced refugees from Rwanda. They are the real victims of the regimes and the continuing power plays by western governments.  These are more interested, he suggests, in the exploitation of rich natural resources, oil, diamonds and metals, than in good governance and democratic participation by the population. For example, French follows groups of desperate Hutu refugees from one camp to another exposing the participation of the Rwandan army (post genocide) in massacres and violence against the refugees and related tribal groups in Eastern Zaire.  He laments the Rwandan government's continuing profound involvement with the events in Zaire/Congo and explores the reasons why the US administration failed to intervene.<br /><br />He interleaves his investigative reporting of events with descriptions of his  encounters with many individuals, whether opposition leaders, artists, Hutu refugees or just plain village folk suffering from the fighting in their surroundings.  His direct approach invites the reader to follow his travels into remote areas of the lush rainforests or the wide ranging savanna. He focuses our attention on the individuals he meets and their circumstances.  Reflecting their perspectives on local events, he lets them convey their views directly in dialogue with him.<br /><br />It is somewhat disappointing that an important book like French's, published in 2004, stops in 1998 when he left his position in the region.  One can appreciate his frustration and sense his exhaustion from four years of crisscrossing the difficult terrain.  Nevertheless, the reader would have greatly benefited from and expected some kind of epilogue on the various events still unfolding when he described them. Also, for those not that familiar with the contemporary history of Central Africa, a summary of historical chronology would have assisted in placing the events described more comprehensively.

Similar to the article, the book immediately struck a chord with me.  Those living within and without their own language will find a special connection to this book.  Language as the identification of \\"home\\" and \\"country\\" and \\"language wars\\" are explored here in a rather exceptional way - through the voice and outlook of a growing child.  Like a patchwork quilt the vignette chapters of the book come together for the reader to form an exquisitely drawn portrait. Hamilton's family is pictured against the backdrop of their Irish reality of poverty and want in the fifties and sixties. Complexities are accentuated by his dual identity as a child of an Irish nationalist father and a German mother who left Germany after the war.<br /><br />While The Speckled People is an intimately personal chronicle of his youth, Hamilton's story has significance far beyond the autobiography genre. There are advantages and challenges in using the language of a child.  On the one hand, experiences can be conveyed in a direct and innocent way.  Johannes (Hugo) has not yet learned to query all he observes: \\"When you're small you know nothing\\". He is a sensitive and perceptive child who intuits that there are more untold dramas in the family.  \\"You can inherit a secret without even knowing what it is.\\"  On the other hand, it may be difficult to maintain the language as the boy's capacity to analyze and reflect becomes more pronounced with age.  Hamilton succeeds admirably in keeping his style consistent even where he integrates numerous events from the wider world as they become relevant to the young boy.  As you settle into his style, the narrative becomes deeply absorbing.<br /><br />The experiences of life under Nazi rule as part of an anti-Nazi family, continue to haunt his mother. Her painful memories are conveyed to the son in small doses, like selected scenes from a black and white movie in which she had a part.  Nonetheless, she is homesick for her native country and all things German.  Books, souvenirs and toys arrive regularly resulting in outbursts of happy laughter.  Johannes records his mother's mood swings expressed through either laughter or primarily mental withdrawal and silence.<br /><br />His father feels more Irish than anybody around them.  He insists on preserving Irish culture and on \\"freeing\\" the Irish people from British influences.  His children become \\"his weapon\\" against the enemy.  He forbids the family to speak English. The children tend to \\"live\\" in German as their mother has difficulties speaking Irish. The Irish language has to be protected even if it means losing business.  This can mean that cheques are not accepted from people who cannot spell &Oacute; hUrmoltaigh - Hamilton in Irish.  The language is your home, \\"your country is your language\\", he insists - it identifies who you are.  The pressure on the children to speak German and Irish at home sets them apart from people in Dublin at the time. There, English was the preferred language.  The children suffer from this enforced isolation. The neighbourhood bullies, responding to their otherness and German identity call them \\"Nazi\\", \\"Hitler\\" or \\"Eichmann\\". They attack them whenever the opportunity arises.  While Johannes repeats to himself and to his mother \\"I am not a Nazi\\", he does not defend himself against the assaults.  One of the rules of the house is to adopt a form of pacifist resistance, the \\"silent negative \\" and not to become part of the \\"fist people\\".  As Johannes grows up, he understandably rebels increasingly against these strictures.  In the end, he discovers his own way out of all the identify confusion, his anger and pain.<br /><br />The Speckled People is a memoir like no other.  Any comparison with other Irish memoirs would seem inappropriate to me. While Hamilton chronicles his childhood and growing up, themes and issues beyondthe personal play a fundamental role. In particular his exploration of the complexities of \\"language\\" as \\"home\\" and \\"country\\" gives this book added richness and depth.

She used her time well. Pursuing research topics close to her heart, she investigated what environmental hotspots can teach us about our past and the future of human evolution.  Combining scientific curiosity with enthusiasm for \\"adventure\\", her travels have taken her to somewhat remote places - in Jordan, Iceland, Madagascar, the Galapagos and the high Arctic among them.  She accompanied numerous specialists in biology, marine ecology, anthropology and other fields, plus local experts, on explorations in their field of study.  She meets extraordinary people, confronting delicate and sometimes dangerous situations. She skillfully explains some of the complex climatology and other science for the non-specialist reader. The result is an engaging book, part travelogue, part environmental analysis, within a historical context.<br /><br />With Darwin's journals of his voyage on the Beagle in hand, she traces his footsteps on the Galapagos. There and elsewhere she maintains an internal dialogue with Darwin wondering what he would have made of the ecological destruction she witnesses. Like the local people in Evatraha, Madagascar, who believe that trees \\"carry their own magic of regeneration\\", we are destroying precious resources somehow believing that \\"there will always be another tree\\".  The evidence, Mitchell warns, attests to the opposite. Today, more species are endangered than ever before and some fragile ecosystems are beyond recovery.  Reflecting on the five mass extinctions on our planet, she casts some doubt on our \\"shelf life\\" in the grand evolutionary scheme of the planet.  Unless, that is, we can learn the lesson that nature's resources are finite and we are not in control of the ecosystems.  Mitchell draws comparisons between Darwin's contemporary critics of his new theories of evolution and our own society's inability or unwillingness to \\"understand evolution as it applies to the future\\".<br /><br />In personal encounters with her travel companions Mitchell has a series of questions to pose. The most fundamental one among them is:  \\"Is the human species suicidal?  What could help us pull back from the brink?  What can we learn from past experiences?\\"  While most of the findings expose the serious threats to our habitat and even question long term survival, Mitchell finds also encouraging trends. There are signs, she eagerly records, that people are learning lessons and are working together to make a difference. The most spectacular of these positive development she finds in Suriname, where large areas of tropical rainforest are being protected as part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. The point is, explains primatologist Russ Mittermeier, for rainforest conservation to be sustainable it has to make economic sense to the local people.  \\"Environmentalists who are innocent of economics have no audience.\\" He's the motor driving this and other conservation projects and an enthusiastic buyer of local artifacts.  This particular story, \\"Where the rainforest goes on forever\\", alone makes the book worth reading.  Still, it is only one of the highly informative while at the same time entertaining chapters.  It is, though, the most optimistic.<br /><br />In the end, as she reflects in the remoteness of the boreal forest in northern Canada on her own lessons learned, Mitchell acknowledges that she has been on a \\"quest for hope\\".

There are some books whose message is so pertinent to your daily life that they stay with you for a long time.  Farmer's PATHOLOGIES OF POWER will have a profound impression on you.  Its substance is highly relevant for current topical debates, whether on Medicare and the forty million uninsured in the US, the Canadian government's  ambition to \\"fix\\" healthcare or on strategies to fight health pandemics like HIV/AIDS. Farmer submits an emphatic challenge to the medical profession, to political and business leaders, mainstream media and all of us.<br /><br />Farmer stands emphatically on the side of the destitute, marginalized and usually overlooked. His vivid case studies exemplify the fate of millions of \\"nobodies\\" - the silent majority of the world's population who have none or inadequate heath care. Why, he asks, are health care services not made available to all human beings irrespective of race, gender, locale, or the ability to pay?  Is it not a fundamental human right?  Why do millions in developing countries, in the slums of US cities or prisons in Russia, die prematurely of infectious diseases to which medical research has found successful treatments?  Can we morally accept that medical research prioritizes cures for baldness or impotence over medicines that protect from drug-resistant tuberculosis or malaria?  And, where has medical ethics come to that condones, or even supports, the \\"commodification\\" of medicine?  How can cost-effectiveness and the ability to pay apply to essential medical treatment? he queries.<br /><br />Rooted in his deep belief in human dignity and the fundamental nature of  human rights, Farmer also draws strength from liberation theology as he \\"walks the talk\\". For more than 20 years, Farmer, anthropologist as well as medical doctor, has dedicated his life to the struggle of the \\"nobodies\\" for survival, health and dignity. Working among the poorest and the outcasts, he has lived with the evidence that illness is intimately linked with poverty.  From his base in central Haiti, one of the world's poorest regions, he has embarked on an international crusade for social and economic rights and the right to health for all - and \\"that means every body!\\"  Whether in Haiti, the slums of New York and Boston, in Peru or the prisons in Russia, \\"structural violence\\" has been the underlying cause for the desperate spiral of illness and destitution. Farmer uses the concept of \\"structural violence\\" broadly to describe social inequalities, lack of economic opportunities, activities of oppressive states: the \\"misery of extreme poverty\\".  Nobel Prize winning economist Amartya Sen, one of Farmer's mentors, describes it as the destructive forces of \\"unfreedoms\\".<br /><br />Farmer's book is a passionate testament to his many patients and their struggle for rights and dignity. Consequently, it is a damning critique of current health delivery services by governments, international health experts and aid agencies. He analyses the flaws of the charity and development models to healthcare and concludes that \\"...In a world riven by inequity, medicine could be viewed as social justice work.\\"<br /><br />While his recounting of individual cases makes at times gloomy reading, his empathy and fervour speak directly to us, his readers. We are drawn emotionally and intellectually into this complex and multifaceted challenge.  Drawing on numerous scholars and practitioners, he exemplifies why we should question the underlying fabric of our current approach to human rights, development policy and globalized economy.  Human rights work, he argues, has primarily been viewed from a legal perspective with an emphasis on civil and political rights.  Instead, he insists, the focus needs to shift so that public health and access to medical care are treated as social and economic rights. These, in turn, have to be understood as critical as civil and political rights, he concludes.<br /><br />PATHOLOGIES OF POWER is central to the currentdebates on health, social justice and human rights. It is also an essential tool for anybody involved in any aspect of public health care, medical ethics and sustainable development. Furthermore, it is an extraordinary study resource for everybody interested in the future of human well being.

Climate Change and Global Warming are very complex concerns indeed.  Many people do not want to see the realities confronting us.  Many skeptics argue that climate change is a phenomenon of nature and/or something delayed to the future.  Indications from far away places need not concern us.  Raising temperatures by 0.6 degrees C is hardly worth thinking about.  If it means that we have warmer weather for a few weeks longer, that can only be comfortable for people living in northern climes.<br /><br />Not so, argue Jim Motavalli and his colleagues.  The intricacies of climate change  and recent warming trends  in remote places such as Alaska and the Antarctic reveal that the warming of the planet impacts us all already.  In a selection of \\"dispatches\\" compiled by the editors of E/The Environmental Magazine, a distinguished group of environmental reporters traveled the world - from Australia to the Pacific Northwest, from China to Europe,  to record scientific assessments and human experiences.  What can we learn from their observations?<br /><br />A case of severe human impact on the environment is vividly explored in \\"The Cost of Coal\\" in Mark Heertsgard's report from China. Rapid economic development comes at a very high price.  For the time being, the prime energy source there remains fossil fuels, resulting in extreme air pollution.  Thick smog covers the cities and people suffer from respiratory and other health problems.  Yet, if the alternative is to freeze in unheated houses or slowing down the industrial advances, Chinese see no choice.  Aware of CO2 greenhouse gas emissions almost rivaling those of the (highest emitter) USA, Chinese politicians and technocrats showed little sympathy for the global impact.  They dismiss it as \\"the cost of progress\\".  At the same time, Chinese authorities regulate industry towards high level of energy efficiency.<br /><br />Closer to home for many readers is a wake-up call on raising sea levels.  Motavalli and Barnes paint a devastating picture of what is in store for Greater New York from the underappreciated impact of global warming.  Not only the tourist industries as the beaches of Florida or Fiji will suffer destruction, island states in the Pacific Ocean are already preparing for the exodus of hundreds of thousands of environmental refugees. The trends are unmistakable. On the other hand, examples from Europe provide a glimmer of hope.  No longer waiting or sitting on the fence, Europeans have taken the lead in \\"planning ahead\\", proving that increasing use renewable energy and economic growth can be combined successfully.<br /><br />Writing about insects and other creatures appearing in ecosystems where they don't belong, several articles demonstrate that the ecosystem balance is under threat.  Warming ocean water results in fish and other sea animals moving out of their traditional habitats.  Their food sources may not have done the same and new dangers may loom in the new environment.  The food chain starting with the smallest critters is already interrupted with impacts on animals further up the chain only a question of a short time.  While the field scientists interviewed for the articles remain cautious, stating that not all global warming should be blamed of human impact, the indications of increasing danger cannot be overlooked.<br /><br />FEELING THE HEAT, while written by several authors,  depicts a cohesive and coherent picture from some of the hotspots of global warming.  Although at times depressing and  exasperating, the underlying message is that of early warnings.  The call on us has to be to do whatever we can to reduce human impact on the environment and climate.

You may wonder what jazz could possibly have to do with \\"The Global Crisis of the Environment\\"!  Speth introduces a new term, \\"JAZZ\\", to explain one of three possible scenarios for environmental governance frameworks. The concept, developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, describes an approach to solving global environmental challenges.  Like musical jazz, it uses a multitude of diverse and \\"unscripted\\" initiatives, based on creativity, flexibility and involving a wide range of players.  The good news, Speth insists, is that, increasingly, JAZZ is being played around the world - decentralized and voluntary. Activities are being driven by environmental and consumer and other citizens' groups, supported or at least \\"facilitated\\" by governments. Businesses, recognizing advantages in these developments, now participate in growing numbers and developing new partnerships. Expanding and multiplying JAZZ is one of the promising trends that can move us towards an \\"environmental revolution\\". Nothing short of it, Speth is convinced, will save our planet.<br /><br />In recent years, scientists, environmentalists and policy makers have learned that, solving the problems of the planet in a sustainable way requires an integrated - \\"ecosystem\\" - approach. Results have been slow and efforts must dramatically accelerate.  Steps to reduce our ecological human footprint have to be augmented by the adoption of \\"ecological economics\\".  A long term goal will see the economy serve primarily the advancement of human development and environmental sustainability.  It will no longer remain an end in itself. New \\"compacts\\" with all sectors of society and the governments in the North and in the South will be struck.<br /><br />Speth does not come to his somewhat optimistic outlook lightly and he remains cautious as to its success.  Based on decades of experience in the environmental field, both in the US and as part of the UN system, he submits one of the most comprehensive analyses of the environmental challenges and dangers one can find today.  Filled with facts, figures, and carefully sourced, he paints a devastating picture of the state of the earth's environment. He urges us to face up to \\"ten drivers of environmental degradation\\".  Added to the environmental impact of population size, affluence and technology (IPAT) are such fundamental problems as poverty, market and political failures. Complementing this examination is his excellent analysis of the inadequate international governmental efforts so far to reach global agreements on environmental protection.  He exposes the weaknesses of such compromise treaties as the UN Convention on Biodiversity, Climate Change and Desertification that lack \\"teeth\\" in terms of binding protocols.  He deplores the withdrawal of the current US administration from international agreements, particularly the Kyoto Protocol.  He acknowledges the European leadership at this time in environmental protection and challenges America to take back the role of leader that it had earlier.<br /><br />For each of the environmental degradation drivers he suggests concrete transition strategies.  The most fundamental of the transitions required, he stresses, and probably the most difficult to achieve fast, is the shift in our consciousness. He commends steps already under way in some of the areas, such as slowing population growth, or reducing the use of pollutants, such as DDT and PCBs.  While these are vital steps, Speth cautions that they will be far from sufficient. Hence the call for an environmental revolution and the establishment of a new institution with the mandate to \\"manage the global environment\\".<br /><br />In his recommendations for future strategies, he argues that an institutional approach based on international environmental law  - the second scenario - GEOpolity - might work in combination with JAZZ, and if enforced by binding international treaties. The third scenario - FROG, [First RaiseOur Growth] - he completely discards as not only ineffectual but also endangering our future. This scenario will lead, he contends, to wrecking our environment and our global society.  After having followed his in-depth review of the impacts of current laissez-faire attitudes, you will probably agree with him.<br /><br />While he addresses economic globalization's impact on the environment, he avoids challenging the role of the big transnational corporations.  The food and pharmaceutical sectors could well represent major stumbling blocks. He deliberately remains within the market economy, convinced that the changes needed can be realized within the current systems.<br /><br />Speth's RED SKY AT MORNING is a vital book. His style is clear and personable. The book is well structured and indexed so that readers can find specific topics easily. While at times focusing heavily on the American audience, the book is important for readers from around the world. His resource guide for citizens underlines his conviction that progress will rely heavily on environmental and consumer groups, scientists, the media and enlightened business people - all part of civil society.

US	51245884	R18C93NCOQP8JZ	1565491467	62624452	Bringing the Food Economy Home: Local Alternatives to Global Agribusiness	Books	5	21	21	N	N	From local to global to local	Calculating the true cost of getting your family's  typical dinner on the table would reveal a  shocking price! In addition to produce cost itself, you would have to include the delivery charges for each meal component: from the producer via long distance shipping, packaging, storage, and distribution to you via your local supermarket.  The authors suggest that product travel distance in reaching our table should be calculated in 'food miles'.  The further the distance - the higher the price .  At least that's what it should logically be.<br /><br />However, as consumers, most of us rarely pay the full cost of any food item.  If we did, we would appreciate more readily how the global food system has turned food production on its head.  Thus claim the authors of this concise and illuminating analysis of globalization of the agribusiness and its impacts on our well-being.  While this slim volume might appear otherwise, the study is packed with useful information and concrete data.  It explains why we are facing major problems in the food economy around the world.  In developing and industrialized countries farmers are abandoning their land to large-scale cash-crop agribusiness or big corporations.  The push for crop monocultures is contributing to land degradation and is skewing food supplies. The authors demystify the notion that a globalized  food system is more efficient and economic and question the logic of its processes.  For example, in recent years the UK has been importing about as much milk as it has exported!  The only beneficiaries of this artificial trade balance, they argue, are the transport businesses and the financial speculators.  As tax payers we subsidize the transportation business by allowing governments to subsidize the development of big agriculture to the detriment of local farmers everywhere. The authors encourage the reader to examine these issues and outline what we can do as consumers and citizens, to reverse current trends.  Examples and case studies are interleafed with tables and statistics illustrating the underlying argument of the authors: to restore local food production and closely link it to the consumer.<br /><br />In this well-structured and easily followed study, the authors examine global food issues from all possible angles: food and health, food and economy, food and community; food and marketing ecologies and (local) food security.  In addition, the authors expose the serious environmental impacts of large-scale monoculture farming and the unnecessary transport of food shipped across the globe or from one end of the country to the other (in the US).  For example, US cookies are exported to Denmark while Danish cookies are exported to the US!  Why not, the authors argue, just swap recipes at minimal cost?<br /><br />In each chapter the implications of globalizing the food sector are summarized, critiqued and contrasted with working alternatives.  For example. initiatives of community-based agriculture or consumer-coops are introduced that are springing up in many countries.  While food production and trade in the developing world are not addressed as the primary focus of the analysis, the consistent negative impacts of a globalized food system on the populations in the South have provided the authors with strong arguments for local diversity in food security systems.  Norberg-Hodge, in particular, has a long track record of researching the impact of international development policies on traditional functioning rural communities in the South.<br /><br />The intended audiences of this book are clearly the consumers and citizens in the industrialized countries. The examples given are highlighting the situation in the US and UK. Yet, they also present interesting insights into other countries' situations.  The authors' conclusion is that the food economy needs to be shifted from its current global level to the local wherever possible. This does not mean, they contend, that all food trade should stop or the consumer should no longer be able to buy exotic foods from far away. Instead, they argue, the priority has to be that people produce staple food locally wherever possible.  Food should be imported only where the local resources cannot fulfill the demand of the population.  Local produce is usually healthier, fresher and can be more appropriate for the local diet and culture.  It is also much cheaper if transport, packaging and storage costs for long distance travel are to be included in the true price of food.<br /><br />This a book to absorb and not just to read once.  It calls for action by everyone and is a toolkit for all those seriously engaged in educating people of all ages in health, environment  and all food issues.  A resource guide is added for further study and action.  [Friederike Knabe, Ottawa Canada]food trade should stop or the consumer should no longer be able to buy exotic foods from far away.

Clark is one of those with the right credentials. He has been working in all the camps of the globalization debate. After many years involvement with international non-profit organizations, he joined the World Bank. Since then he has advised governments on civil society issues and distilled his experience also into university-based research projects. Drawing on these diverse backgrounds, WORLDS APART is more than just another solid analysis of globalization issues. Clark manages to confront all parties, whether government, corporation, civil society organization or us as individuals. Clark takes us behind the assorted arguments, dissecting some while debunking others. His conclusions do not lead to a 'battle' striving for ethical globalization but rather to an appeal and well-argued strategies for a new ethics of globalization. He sees civil society playing a crucial role in its realization. Do we have a choice in responding to the appeal? Clark does not think so as the ever-widening gap between rich and poor has become intolerable. Even economic, financial, and political power brokers appear to have recognized that change on a global scale is unavoidable.<br /><br /> Clark builds his arguments through the three parts of his book. In 'Impact of Globalization' he gives the reader an overview of the challenges encapsulated by globalization. While reviewing its processes, opportunities and problems from the economic, trade and political perspectives, he critiques the standard responses put forward by proponents and critics. There are no easy answers and Clark's intention is to explain why globalization is so controversial. By taking a pro-poor perspective he exposes the causes for the increasing inequalities in terms of incomes, wealth, security and power for ever larger sectors of society in developing and industrialized countries alike. At the same time, he presents a strong case for poor countries to open to international trade. In the main Clark concurs with those who argue that globalization as such is not a culprit. Yet he concludes that it has resulted in a 'comparative advantage for some - and an absolute disadvantage for many'. Imprecision in the term globalization itself, he argues, and the self-serving interpretations by a few major industrial powers, among them in particular the US - the 'G1' - have led to the imbalances and resulted in mistrust in governments, transnational corporations and institutions such as the World Bank.<br /><br /> In the second part Clark explores 'How Global Change affects Civil Society'. Fortunately, Clark stresses, new forces are emerging from within civil society that can (and must) provide a countervailing force to existing powers structures. Leaving aside the debate over the definition of the term 'civil society', Clark starts from a clear concept: civil society represents 'collective activities of citizens for purposes of social change rather than individual gain', represented by civil society groups (CSOs). These are giving a voice to the concerns and aspirations of the poor and the majorities marginalized by globalization. This does not mean, he explains, that civil society is homogenous or that all CSOs are always on the 'good' side of the argument. Diversity provides strength so long as it is accompanied by the ability to work together for a broader consensus. Civil society organizations have a crucial and ever-increasing role to play at all levels - from local to international. Strategic networks have been forming to ensure transnational coordination of action. While applauding the increasing importance of CSOs in the global arena, he draws attention to the growing responsibilities that come with their new role. Clark goes deeper in his analysis of civil society and its organizations than most, examining the wide range of challenges faced by CSOs - from accountability and legitimacy to integrity and 'representivity'. He does not ignore the varied, at times even contradictory, ambitions of the different groupings and juxtaposes the relative comfort and establishment perspectives of northern CSOs with the more aggressive grassroots movements of the South. In particular, he challenges US civil society groups for not taking on a stronger domestic political role.<br /><br /> Throughout the book, Clark draws out conclusions, which he expands on in the final part, 'The Path to Ethical Globalization'. Exploring a series of concrete and, according to him, realistic recommendations, he addresses not only civil society but equally governments and international institutions. What is needed, he deduces, is the political will of all to move towards implementation.<br /><br /> WORLDS APART is a very important and engaging book! Combining lucid analysis with the passion of personal experience, Clark argues his case in a clear and direct style. He has the ability to bring the complexity of the issues to the reader without losing their interest. This information-rich book should be read by anybody who wants to learn more about civil society's role in the globalization challenge and those who think they already know it all.

The reason is the disappearing Aral Sea and the urgent need to face the threat and, hopefully, launch a regional campaign to reverse the dangerous trend. The story is also about the politicians who have taken(or maintained control) over the running of the five neighboring states after the collapse of the Soviet system, their politics now and then to plan away this precious water and biodiversity resource.  Add to that situation the ambitions of the World Bank and international consultants to guide the process you get a dangerous mix. Ferguson's account of his one-year stint in Tashkent is a fascinating read that brings to light scenarios that are as hilarious as they are infuriating.<br />It is not giving anything away to hint at the danger to persons: the author gets under suspicion to have been involved in the murder of one of the local recruits. As the story unfolds one can understand why - and it is a lot more complex than it appears on the surface. One major thread is the interaction of the team of local bureaucrats and experts with the international group brought in to work with them.  Ferguson's characterization of the people involved is excellent. They come alive off the page, in particular those of  \\"the other side\\". The sides of friend and foe are not always clear and can change more or less overnight. All the main characters are engaged in this World Bank-financed grand scheme to save the Aral Sea. It should be added that the Aral Sea once was the world's fourth largest inland body of water. Now only 20% of its 1960 size, experts fear that it will have disappeared by 2020.  Urgent action was required and the Bank, with a team of foreign experts, stepped in to move the program forward. How much the local water leadership has been behind the project is another question to explore. Ferguson was hired to advise the public education component, meaning to get the publics to understand the dangers of the disappearing water and to engage them in possible remedies. Following him on his mission to connect with the five public education teams, to share ideas and to get them moving towards the common goal, the reader is drawn into mesh of intrigue, suspicion, greed and much more.<br />On his travels, Ferguson takes time out to visit historic cities like Samarkand and Bukhara (both in Uzbekistan), major centres on the ancient Silk Road from China to the West. His knowledge of the region's fascinating history is solid and he conveys what is useful without overburdening the reader. He has a gift for observation of places and ambiance just as much as of people. Having visited these cities many years ago and forgotten many details, I found Ferguson's vivid description brought them all back with ease. Whether he explores more remote spaces, climbs mountains or drinks tea with village elders; his astute observations and ability to put his impressions into words make this also a reliable travel guide.<br />Rich in culture and tradition based on a long and multifarious history of Kyrgyz, Kazakh, Tajik, Turkmen and Uzbek peoples, this region was artificially divided into five states by the Soviet regime in disregard of where the different peoples lived.  The underlying regional rivalries and resentments have remained major traits of their relationships, at least as far as the soviet-style bureaucrats are concerned who still are in control of the water management systems.<br />Yet, the real and underlying issue of this book are the dangers to the region's fragile ecosystems. Exacerbated by Soviet-controlled industrial development paralleled by mismanagement of its water resources, the dangers to the Aral Sea and its environment have been ignored for decades. The region is fast running out of water to sustain its growing population. It is an object lesson for similar emerging crises elsewhere. Yet, politics and power games continue to overrule environmental protection requirements. Increased international interests in the region, not only due to its position close to Afghanistan but also because of its natural gas reserves, have brought international agencies like the World Bank on the scene. Reading Ferguson's honest account of their involvement raises important questions and one has to wonder whether this venture was a good choice.

Books	5	15	15	N	N	A wonderful African treasure	The inspiration for the No.1 Lady Detective, Ma Ramotswe, came to McCall Smith while he observed a \\"traditionally built and cheerful\\" woman chasing a chicken in a yard in Botswana. Precious Ramotswe became the heroine of this delightful and engaging series. The box set contains the first three volumes and, as an extra treat, an African folk tale from a forthcoming collection.  If you, as I did, just bought the first volume on its own, keep it to lend or give to friends and get the set right away.  Mm Ramotswe's charm, humanity and her special sense of fairness will keep you entertained and your heart warmed.  You will feel like the author who could not leave Ma Ramotswe at the end of the first book - \\"it would have been like leaving in the middle of a conversation\\".<br />The diverse cases handled by the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency, while providing a thread through the books, are not really the main theme.  The stories provide the reader with an insight into social aspects of one African society rarely offered in such a caring and empathic way. With great sensitivity McCall Smith explores rising conflicts between the traditional values of Botswana society and the modern influences brought from the cities across the border in South Africa. Of course, there are also the usual domestic conflicts that are the bread and butter of private detectives. Mma Ramotswe solves these with aplomb and wit, using common sense and her own version of justice.  It is sometimes more important to teach the culprit a lesson and change his ways than to hand him (or her) over to the police authorities...<br />Through all the descriptions of her cases and daily goings on in her life, McCall Smith reveals his love for Botswana, her people and the environment.  With each volume, we get more intimately involved with the main characters.  In addition to Precious, her fianc&eacute;, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, her assistant Mma Makutsi and her father, the late Obed Ramotswe who continues to play an important role in her life are major players.  One would love to sit down with Precious on the veranda of her house on Zebra Drive to watch the sun set behind the trees and, drinking her favourite bush tea, reflect on life and its quirky sides.

(Contemporary Political Theory)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	More than a bright idea	Where does the concept `global civil society' stem from, what does it really mean today?  Where will the vision contained in the concept lead us?  John Keane, the founder of the Centre for the Study of Democracy (UK) and leading thinker in the field, offers readers a thorough and well-argued set of answers and wide-ranging questions to consider.<br /> `Global Civil Society' has developed into a catchphrase within the current globalization debate.  This scholarly analysis of its historical origins debunks some widely held myths and contributes to a much clearer conceptualization. Keane contends that past attempts to build global civil societies failed, drawing on examples from Christianity, Islam, ancient and more recent Empires and socialism Soviet style. To underpin his own definition of civil society, he cites numerous schools of thought. Characterizations range from very broad to very narrow. All concur that civil society is a counterbalance to government. Some see it as all encompassing - including all sectors of society except government.  Others prefer a very narrow, idealist vision that restricts civil society to non-government, non-profit groupings that have a more or less common social and political agenda. Modern Global Civil Society, he argues, has to be understood against the backdrop of the failures of the past.  Whereas he accepts that Western European intellectual elites of the 19th century were among the catalysts for current global societal developments, he refutes the criticism of those who consider today's vision of Global Civil Society a Northern concept imposed on the rest of the world.  The presence of strong and growing movements from Southern countries proves his point.<br />Global, regional or national inter-connected networks of widely differing non-governmental organizational configurations typify the modern civil society movements. Consequently, Keane states, global citizens today are not at all anti-globalization. Instead they are marked by a `cross-border mentality', having created a `special social space' from where they can challenge the powers that be, whether governmental or corporate. Keane identifies one important common thread among the movements: the mutual respect for diversity, compromise and connectivity.<br />He also reminds us of the complex interplay of civil society movements with their societal counterparts.  Governments and the corporate sector, in particular today's `turbocapitalists', have played a major role and the evolution of civil society.  Recognizing that the dynamics between civil society, governments and corporate business is often contradictory, Keane urges all players not to be discouraged in working towards a new global system of governance. He insists that what is needed is bold new democratic thinking for a new world governance system - an `unprecedented world polity' - which he defines as `cosmocracy'. Cosmocracy is an evolving and dynamic system. Even though we do not have all the answers and aspects of it appear confusing and chaotic, reading Keane impels us to boldly go where no society has gone before...<br />While elements of this `global conglomeration of interacting and overlapping institutions and processes' are in existence today, such as the UN, these are not adequate, as traditional thinking will not suffice. The diverse threats and vulnerabilities to global civil society can be addressed, he contends, as long as the gravest danger to its survival is prevented: fatalism.<br />Keane's investigation represents a major contribution to current thinking on global civil society and world governance systems. The meticulous referencing to his sources through extensive footnotes offers the reader more than a glimpse into the academic debates surrounding the issues raised by his study. Anybody with an interest in socio-political studies would be well advised to use this book as a starting point for research and a guide to further reading.

Its rise to the fame reminds me of those exquisite low-budget movies that suddenly appear on the scene and capture audiences around the world. Mark Haddon, an award-winning children's book author, originally wrote the Curious Incident primarily for young audiences, not the general adult reader. Yet, the story and the character are anything but simplistic. Not surprisingly, given its captivating story, its moving main character, and unique style, it won literary awards for youth and children's books. Then, something curious happened as it caught the attention and imagination of the grown-ups... Having just won the Whitbread Prize for the best novel in 2003, it has achieved a rare recognition by winning awards across different literary categories.<br />The story is written from the perspective of Christopher, a 15-year-old youth with ambitions of becoming an astronaut.  It is about experiences in his life, his \\"Special Needs\\" as an autistic youth and his surroundings. At some level he comes across like a younger child that can only react physically to uncomfortable situations, at another he acts like a very mature teenager who can explain his difficulties and reactions. He applies logic and analysis to help him understand real life problems as intellectual puzzles, such as who murdered the poodle. Given a certain rigidity of his systematic thought processes, he cannot give up on a path once chosen, whether intellectually or physically. The resulting problems have to be faced, whatever.  If his parents could have read his book, they would have had a much easier time coping with him.<br />For me Haddon's book is a gem for a number of reasons. It is very real and touching story of a very special teenager that pulls the reader right into it and along with it.  Christopher's ability to observe his surroundings and himself and describe his thought processes in \\"his\\" book allows the reader insights into a personality that we know little about. Haddon describes this environment where autism makes life complicated for Christopher and difficult for his parents with great care, yet he does not allow the special situation to become overbearing. He also demonstrates that people suffering from autism have a lot to offer and their special needs may not as far removed from those of the average normal person.  It is a question of degree.

PEOPLE BEFORE PROFIT does this in a way that places it in the top range of my recommended books.  In addition to providing a wealth of important reflections and very useful facts, Derber covers the complex topics surrounding globalization in a clear and very accessible style.  By placing himself inside the circumstances and arguments he addresses his readers directly, fostering ongoing reflection and dialogue.<br />Derber examines the various uses and misuses of the term \\"globalization\\" that \\"globalizers\\" and \\"anti-globalizers\\" are claiming for their own ends.  He cuts through the ideologies and myths by probing the concept within its historical context - reminding us that globalization and its driving force, \\"empire building\\", have been around for thousands of years. All ancient globalization systems were based on the exploitative relationship between a \\"core\\" and the \\"periphery\\". The net wealth flowed from the periphery (natural resources, cheap labour) to the core (skilled labour, technology) resulting in an ever-increasing gap between the rich core and the poor periphery.<br />Derber compares such uneven co-dependent power relationships to a dysfunctional marriage where the powerful partner can leave or bullies the other into submission. The win-win myth of globalization is in fact a \\"race to the bottom\\" where the corporations alone have the \\"exit power\\".  He emphasizes parallels between early US history and the ambitions of recent US administrations. While confined in those days to one country, the concept of globalization can be applied to the American \\"Robber Barons\\" then just as much as to the US power brokers of big corporations today. Derber contends their desire to expand economic power and political influence is dependent on the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.  \\"Free trade\\" is a misnomer in the context of unequal power relationships between the rich North and the developing countries of the South.  In Derber's comparison today's billions of poor in Southern countries have taken the place of the exploited impoverished workforce during the \\"Gilded Age\\", underpinning his arguments with many pertinent examples. Yet, his main objective is to motivate all participants in the \\"globalization game\\" to learn important lessons from the past. His fundamental precept is that we must \\"reinvent globalization to create a safe, democratic and economically secure world\\".<br />He challenges the narrow economic perspective of corporate leaders, arguing that globalization without democratization will fail sooner rather than later. Insisting that the political, social and cultural aspects of a globalized world have to be given equal prominence, he dissects the world economic and trading systems, such as the WTO, IMF and the World Bank. He emphasizes the importance of the \\"positive rights\\" of the UN system (right to food, shelter, work, etc.).  These issues, he stresses, are of utmost importance in a fairer globalized world.  He deplores the refusal of US administrations to adhere to existing international legal instruments.  At the same time, he examines the \\"antiglobalization\\" movements differentiating between the \\"UN camp\\" and the \\"barbershoppers\\", the latter concerned only with the local community. Derber argues strongly that the localists and the globalists have to come together into a network of global justice movements that recognize that real democracy at one level cannot be sustained without democracy at all levels. He challenges his critics who have called him an idealist or similar with clear arguments, reporting on positive trends in intergovernmental trade debates as well as the democratization processes that have emerged since the Seattle demonstrations.<br />Derber elaborated four principles for a \\"global New Deal\\" designed to bring democratic control to the global system and toestablish fair economic and trade relationships.  One pre-requisite is the dismantling of the Bretton Wood institutions, i.e. the IMF, WTO and World Bank, which he sees as a major culprit for the current unfair global trading system. Real participation of people and accountability to civil society represent other crucial components of his vision. Finally, the \\"global security\\" we all want and need, whether citizen or transnational corporation, cannot be achieved without tackling the extreme rich-poor divide in this world.  Derber concludes PEOPLE BEFORE POWER with a series of concrete action recommendations for his readers.  Read this book, whatever perspective you have on globalization.

Yet, this is the starting point of Singer's investigation into the ethics of globalization. For Singer they describe important aspects of globalization. He argues that despite the trauma created by 9/11 for people in the US, it was a short, sharp, shocking event killing fewer people than children dying each day around the world from poverty and disease. In the longer term it also pales against the ongoing destruction of our ecosystem threatening humanity's survival as a consequence of our rich lifestyle.<br />Many books examine the different aspects of  \\"globalization\\", from the pro- and the anti- perspectives to everything in between. While Singer does not question the realities of an increasingly integrated world, he argues the case for serious scrutiny of the motives underlying the current state of affairs. He urges an overhaul of the principles and standards of globalization politics so that everybody might benefit from it. He is aware of the difficulties in achieving the ideal, and outlines the obstacles candidly.  He pleads the case of the 1.2 billion people who live in abject poverty. Their aspirations for a better lifestyle is as legitimate as ours, yet its realization will remain in doubt as long as the industrialized countries refuse to make adjustments to theirs.  Singer places his arguments for fairer international systems within historical and moral contexts and suggests practical solutions.<br />He asks appropriate, pragmatic questions under each of four major themes that define humanity's \\"one world\\": environment, economy, law and community.  We all share one atmosphere where overexploitation of the environment in the industrialized countries can result in ecosystem destruction in developing countries. We are also increasingly interdependent in the trade and economic systems that may be \\"free\\" but not necessarily fair. We claim to have one workable international legal system, but it requires that all states participate to make it effective. Finally, we are all part of a human community, so we need to consider our actions accordingly.  Singer challenges our assumptions while dissecting the effects of laissez-faire attitudes among policy makers and corporate leaders. In the chapter \\"one atmosphere\\" he elaborates why the US government's refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol is morally unacceptable and totally unethical. His analysis of the reasons is followed by a proposal that builds on four principles of fairness.  The thrust of his critique is addressed at the power brokers in today's globalized world and less to the average citizen who is treated more or less as an observer. Still, he provides his readers with solid arguments that they can apply in their dealings with their representatives. His call for engagement in the global ethics debate culminates in the chapter \\"one community\\". Here, Singer asks us to contribute towards building a fairer world by very practical means. He analyzes why humans tend to be more caring for those close to home and in their own country.  However, he argues that the concept of  the `nation state' may become obsolete as global communities develop. He urges the reader to empathize with those in need wherever they are and share of what they can spare with those less fortunate than themselves.<br />Most of the content of the book was written in 2000 following a lecture series. Singer updated the text prior to publication in the light of 9/11 and recent trends in international trade and politics.  While his questions on international trade, focusing particular on the WTO, are relevant, some of his conclusions have been superseded by current developments. His cautious optimism of a fairer trade system for developing countries in the context of the WTO was evidently premature. Similarly, his expectations that the US will in the end join the International Criminal Code and the Kyoto Protocol appear doomed.  His hope for a \\"more democratically controlled system of regulation that promotes minimum standards for environmental protection, worker safety, union rights, and animal welfare\\" may remain a dream for some time.  One World presents a useful overview of the different aspects of ethics and morals that an interdependent globalized is required to confront if it wants to survive and thrive in the future.

At the same time, they usually present the partners and their surroundings with distinctive challenges. Yet, these must pale in comparison to a love bond between a homo sapiens and an evolved modern-day Neanderthal. Ancient DNA expert Mary Vaughn of Toronto met Physicist Ponter Boddit of Saldek (the Neanderthal equivalent to Sudbury in Northern Ontario) after he was thrown into our version of earth by a quantum computer accident. After various exploratory visits, mainly by scientists, between the parallel universes, a constant portal is established allowing a regular exchange of scientific knowledge and philosophical ideas.  The two lovers are determined to bring the two parallel realities closer together.<br />With great skill and immense empathy for this alternative to the homo sapiens' world Sawyer builds a far-reaching vision of Neanderthal society covering all aspects of its environment, its people and their accomplishments.  Exploring the scientific innovations of \\"Barast\\" culture provides him a platform for discussing the latest thinking in genetics, consciousness studies, brain research, and physics. His comprehensive knowledge and enthusiasm for scientific subjects shine through all levels of the narrative without becoming heavy or too demanding for the reader. At one level, the Neanderthal version of the universe is presented as a mirror of what could have been in our world. Take the environment: the dialogue between Ponter and Jock, Mary's boss, during a copter flight over New York beautifully illustrates the differences between the two versions of earth as it leaves a deep impression on Jock:  Manhattan IS the \\"Island of Hills\\" - devoid of skyscrapers, people and traffic. It makes him wish that we \\"could start all over again with a clean slate\\".<br />As Mary spends more time in Ponter's world she learns to accept the differences, up to a point. Many aspects of Barast society are so markedly different that it is not be easy to adapt.  For one, our concept of individual freedoms does not mean much here.  For example, while the ubiquitous communication system allows instant contact between people, it is monitoring all movements and discussions for the archival record. As one result crime is almost non-existent. Men and women live pretty much separate lives, each with a same-sex mate and their monthly four-day heterosexual coming together - `Two become One', is treated like a holiday.  Children are born according to a predefined generational schedule, allowing the society to maintain population levels stable.  Besides the timing, the lovers' wish to conceive a child appears impossible due to the difference in their chromosomes. Sawyer just loves to explain complex genetics in layperson's terms! But DNA research has advanced, mainly in Ponter's world, and new possibilities emerge. The technology is also open to abuse and causes ethical dilemmas. There are more complexities to delve into concerning genetics, above all the potential existence of a specific set of genes, a \\"God organ\\".  The question of religion has been a major theme throughout the trilogy and here it ends in a dramatic climax.<br />Sawyer's fluent style and clear, lively narrative make this one of best reads around.  At the same time, you learn about some fascinating new research and scientific discoveries and can ponder some important questions about the society we live in. If you have not read the first two volumes of the Neanderthal Parallax, don't feel discouraged. The indispensable background to understand the story is sprinkled throughout this volume.

She has the tools: a cast-iron frying pan, a piece of string, an unusual book of recipes, and, above all, the memory of her very special granny. To rescue her brother, Tiffany has to enter a fairyland, full of strange and dangerous creatures, all controlled by an evil \\"Quin\\".  Fortunately, she has inherited \\"first sights and second thoughts\\" - a powerful combination for a budding witch.  These are essential talents for her to distinguish between reality and dreams: \\"to see what is really there\\" and what is imagination created within a dream.  \\"Follow your dream\\", Miss Tick's advice to Tiffany, builds up to a real challenge when Tiffany, after fighting wild animals and dream-creating dromes finally confronts the Queen.  She has to peel off layer after layer of their dreams to escape from being taken over by them, then use her own dreaming power to find a way back to her own reality.<br />Tiffany's quest wouldn't have a chance at being successful - and would be a lot less funny -without the Nac Mac Feegle.

Yet the evidence, literally dug up from beneath thousands of years of Sahara sands, established that habitation in this dry region goes back nearly half a million years.<br />Excavations also revealed that the level of adaptability of the people to their arid environment reflected the rise and fall of empires of which little was known before.<br /><br />The Dakhleh Oasis, a two thousand square kilometre area in Egypt's Western Desert comprises a patchwork of villages, palm groves and farmed fields. The casual visitor would find it difficult to imagine that this area of sand, rocks and lush green fields holds a unique historical record into our ancient past.  Tracing the fascinating history of the Oasis and its surroundings, Thurston conveys the extraordinary story of this region and of the research project and its findings over the last 25 years. Presented in a conversational style, Thurston chronicles the discovery of the extraordinary treasures of this land based on two visits to the Dakhleh Oasis Research Project (DOP) and many discussions he had with project members over the years.<br />Initiated by two adventurous Canadians, fascinated by ancient Egypt, the project was launched in 1977 in collaboration with the ROM (Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto). Ever since, it has been expanding in size and scope, attracting an international team of experts. It is unique in its mandate and methodology. The mandate has been the study of human adaptability to a dryland ecozone and human activity's impact on it, from prehistory to today. It has required a team with very diverse scientific expertise.  The research addresses archaeology, genetic makeup of early humans, ancient flora and fauna, land and water resource management, climate change and much more.  This multidisciplinary approach allowed the team, over time, to map the history of the oasis, its peoples' living conditions and environment, identifying it as probably the world's oldest uninterruptedly lived-in location.  Dakhleh was blessed above all else by the interminable availability of water from an underground aquifer, supplied by artesian wells. As long as the resources were used responsibly, Oasis dwellers benefited from fresh water irrespective of changing climatic conditions. Thurston reports on the earliest agricultural societies, their rise to becoming the breadbasket of Egypt followed by their fall when land and water resources were overexploited.  A remarkable result, explains Thurston, has been the emerging understanding of the fundamental influence of climate change on human development and, in parallel the potentially devastating impact of human behaviour on fragile ecosystems.<br />His thoroughly researched study of the history of the Dakhleh Oasis is a treat for anybody interested in the history of human civilization and the interdependence of human development and fragile ecosystems. Thurston succeeds in presenting the reader with a fascinating and gripping story, \\"a microcosm of the human drama being played out on our planet\\". He argues convincingly that by understanding the past we can learn lessons for the present. \\"In essence, it's about water, its exploitation and conservation\\".<br />The book is so information rich that you want to go back to it, each time following a different theme or historical time frame. The chapters follow the historical chronology so that it is easy to select certain cultural periods. Unfortunately, for those interested in following a specific theme through time, the index will not help you much as it omits the all-important cross-references to topics and issues. The bibliography on the other hand is useful and leads to more specific readings.

Even the Discworld is not quite what Pratchett fans can identify. Magic is only like a whiff or shadow appearing from time to time. We encounter few of the regular heroes or places.  Borogravia is not a major spot on the Discworld map. The small country is embattled in apparently never-ending wars with its neighbours about who knows what.  Its rulers claim it to be a peace-loving place - thus it's always somebody else's fault. With so many battles, the army is running out of recruits so that a troll, a \\"reformed\\" vampire (having replaced his craving for blood with one for coffee), an \\"Igor\\" (known for his ability to stitch severed limbs and other missing parts back on people), a couple of lost youths with nothing better to do, and one following a religious calling, are enlisted. And, above all, a girl, disguised as one of the boys, wants to join the fun: Polly Perks or \\"Private Parts\\".<br />Polly is young, smart and courageous.  With her hair cut short, in men's clothes and imitating some \\"typical\\" male habits, she easily fools the recruiting officers. Or does she?  Polly has several reasons to join the war effort - she needs to find her soldier brother who has not been writing home. Also, she has not really much to look forward to in this country.  Borogravia is run by a Duchess who may or not be alive, and Nuggan, the local deity, who issues strict rules for his followers, reflected in an ever expanding list of \\"Abominations\\". These become stranger as time moves on. They include a ban on the colour blue, having your picture taken, newspapers, or the use of garlic. Women's lives are especially restricted: not only should girls not wear trousers, they cannot own land, houses or run a business.<br />The story follows Polly, a skillful observer, who always asks pertinent questions.  What is the purpose of the war, the upcoming battle, the enemy and the truth in all she hears and sees: \\"We are still winning this war, aren't we?!\\" Sergeant Jackrum, an old hand in the business of war, guides the motley crew of new recruits towards the battlefield. There is no time for training, really, but as the archetypical military father figure, he intends to \\"look after my lads\\".

The constant thread in this story of the daily life of a regular, sort of, family is the Friday night movie club - Harriet Browning, her two children, and neighbour and journalist friend Dinah Bloom.  Discussions among the movie buffs focus on characters rather than plotlines: comparing the acting skills of Cary Grant or Marlon Brando or the good looks of Katherine Hepburn or Greta Garbo. The latter has a special place in the household of Harriet, author of some notoriety and the primary selector of films to watch - she looks a bit like the enigmatic actress, hidden laughs and all. The films appear to be more important than the daily realities. Only Harriet's husband Lew provides the link to the realisms of the outside world - he travels to distant places and brings back impressions and a special souvenir for Harriet.<br />We are invited to share the daily life of Harriet's family and neighbours - through the better part of a year that included the ice storm of 1998.  The story takes place in a close-knit neighbourhood in Ottawa. Hay sets the scene of the cozy community in which every body knows everybody and they all interact frequently. Emotions, concealed or expressed, flow between the various characters.  The arrival of aunt Leah, widow of a Hollywood screenwriter, and her stepson Jack bring upheaval to the daily routines. Some relate better to them than others and relationships become more complicated.  Leah is an astute observer of people and knows how to rub salt into the proverbial emotional wounds. Harriet's problems with the goings on are aggravated by her inability to sleep: she watches the old movies over and over again and at all hours of day or night - no wonder she has sleeping problems! Her ongoing musings on her life, her relationships and her surroundings are shared in frequent, un-mailed letters to real-life movie critic, Pauline Kael.<br />For movie expert Kenny, the teenage son of Harriet and Lew, actors and their abilities are more important than real life concerns. His probing mind is focused on the silver screen. In the meantime, his problems in school can only be pushed aside for so long...<br />Hay has a unique talent to make this family and her surroundings breathe; she brings each character into his or her own. Her portrait of the place, the time and - of course - the weather - are gems in descriptive power. Let's not ignore that there is a story line to follow, endearing and captivating, which flows effortlessly carrying the main characters along. Hay has created a wonderful story that deserves to be read, and not only by classic movie aficionados.

US	51245884	R1OZ9PCL6X9ARC	0151007640	240499638	Crabwalk	Books	5	11	13	N	N	Missing notes in the scaleÔøΩ	The events  surrounding the biggest naval disaster in history and its tragic outcome are not an easy topic to bring to the attention of the reader of fifty-some years later. \\"Why only now?\\" is a good question and one that starts CRABWALK. The Wilhelm Gustloff, a \\"Strength through Joy\\" cruise ship turned refugee carrier, sank after a Soviet submarine attack on January 30 1945 leading to the death of more than 9,000 people, half of them children and infants. Although the details of the sinking have been known since then, there has been reluctance to publicize them. Grass has found a way to break the silence. At least one aspect of his motivation for doing so revolves around the disaster's aftermath in today's society and emerges clearly towards the end of the book.<br />Tulla Pokriefke, one of the survivors of the tragedy, cannot find words to describe what she saw on the ship as the torpedoes hit: \\"There's no notes in the scale for it...\\"  Nevertheless, for years she has been insisting that her son write it all down - the way she remembers it.  Paul Pokriefke, a second-rate middle-aged journalist, born on one of the rescue ships at the time of the sinking, reluctantly takes  on the \\"job\\". He's pressured into it by the major background player, Grass himself. Paul timidly argues with Him about the format, scope and depth of his book. He is in favour of a neutral documentary on the ship, its history and its namesake, a Nazi \\"martyr\\" and hero. His disinclination to take on this project at all speaks volumes about his generation's reluctance to relive and confront all aspects of the German past. Paul is typical in other ways too...  But He nags and guides Paul through the details: take the central theme of the sinking of the ship and trace its history; bring out the lives of the people directly connected with it; don't forget Tulla, yourself and your son - make it personal. The outcome is a description of historical characters like Wilhelm Gustloff, the Nazi activist, David Frankfurter, the German Jew who killed him in 1936, and Alexandr Marinesko, the submarine captain who sank the vessel, interwoven with Paul's and his family's life, from then to now. Three generations of Pokriefkes, deeply influenced by the disaster, have to deal with it and the wider Nazi history in their individual way. None of them is comfortable with their present-day life.<br />It takes a specially gifted writer and authoritative critic like Gunter Grass to make this tragedy public in a format that is meaningful today. Having referred to the sinking of the Gustloff in previous novels, \\"it seems that He knew Tulla when she was young\\", he had been reluctant to expand on it until he had identified the right fictional frame in which to embed the facts. He found it in the strong character of Tulla, 18 at the time of the disaster and turning completely white on that day, who epitomizes the successful survivor and practical realist of her generation. She remains in the East, seemingly switching allegiances without effort to the Stalinist regime, defending it long after the Wall has crumbled.<br /><br />Gunter Grass' language and literary skills are undeniable; but his often difficult language (at least in German) and his complex imagery and use of metaphor have brought him admirers as well as critics. In CRABWALK, both the language and the imagery do not present any difficulty for the reader. In fact, the text flows relatively smoothly: it reads fast despite the subject matter. Walking sideways like a crab and \\"scuttling backwards\\" to move forward describes the flow of the story.  Slowly the characters come into view and the different strands merge to form a comprehensive picture.  Paul's more or less ongoing commentary about his writing efforts, his reactions to family and Him, his jumping back and forth in the story, results, at times, in a somewhat lighter, more conversational tone.<br />Grass deliberately uses the structure of a traditional `novella' (not specified in the English version) to convey the historical events and their impact on his group of Germans.  An addition to being a `short novel', a novella is usually more tightly structured and focused on a single major event. It often comprises a didactic angle or moral message.  All of these elements can be found in CRABWALK. Grass' message in particular addresses the after-war generation(s). He integrates into the story the recurrent problem of young neo-nazis, skinheads and the danger of hate websites on the Internet characterized through Paul's son Konny. He reflects on the inability of the parent generation to come to terms with the children as well as their own reality.  He criticizes the lukewarm attitudes towards politics and history by many Germans of Paul's generation. He is concerned with what the future holds.  The German word `Krebs' - CRAB also means cancer. Although not stated directly the reader of German cannot avoid reflecting on this connotation. Like cancers, totalitarian and fascist systems infect society, then go into remission, come and go. Can we be wholly cured of them?  CRABWALK is on many levels an important book, which leaves you with ample food for thought.

Accompanying his reflections on the traumatic impact of the air war against German cities are essays studying the very diverse reactions of three `witnesses' of that time as reflected in their post-war literary works. In AIR WAR AND LITERATURE, originally presented as the Zurich Lectures, Sebald delves deeply into some very uncomfortable questions. The air war on 131 German cities killed some six hundred thousand civilians and destroyed more than the homes of seven and a half million people. Why have these events resulted mostly in public silence for decades? Why have so few literary works attempted to speak to the traumatic impact on the population? Most Germans seem to have tried to come to terms with the realities of the war years by suppressing their immediate pain and the longer-term suffering. Sebald has thoroughly researched a multitude of authors, both in fiction and non-fiction. Yet, he deems their explanations unsatisfactory.  Heinrich Boell is cited as one of the early exceptions, yet publication of his book, The Silent Angel, was delayed by forty years.<br />Sebald contemplates the different causes for this persistent silence. For example, basing himself on a range of contemporary sources, he confronts the reader with a detailed description of the Hamburg firestorm. As disturbing as his account is, Sebald's reflective style makes it readable. His objective reporting neither criticises the Allies' campaign nor does he apologise for German actions leading to the war. He wonders, though, whether the depth of the traumatic experiences of this and other air attacks may have left many people numb and dazed, unable to express their reactions for a long time. The account of a young mother wandering through the station confused and stunned is one of several examples. Her suitcase suddenly opens onto the platform revealing the charcoaled remains of her baby.<br />Sebald's intent is not to shock but to explain the deep sense of loss that must have been felt by people like her. He further contends that at that time in the war, the growing acceptance of guilt for the Nazi's atrocities led in many civilians to an acknowledgment of justified punishment by the Allied forces.  Last, not least, after the war many Germans experienced a `lifting of a heavy burden' that they felt they had lived under during the Nazi regime.  Concentrating on building the new Germany focused their minds on a better future. The publication (in German) of his Lectures in 1997 resulted in a range of reactions from readers. He reflects their varied views and comments in a postscript, thereby adding a fascinating 1990's dimension to his \\"rough-and-ready collection of various observations, materials, and theses\\".<br />The three authors who are the subject of the essays in this volume may be better known to students of German literature and culture.  They represent a fine example of Sebald's skill as a contemplative and sensitive literary critic. At the same time, these essays complement Sebald's Lectures in a more fundamental way.  In terms of coming to terms with the Nazi period and its atrocities, each one represents a specific type of German with his own means and ways of dealing with the recent past.  Alfred Andersch is presented as having reinterpreted his personal history to fit his vision of self-importance in post-war Germany. Jean Amery, of half Jewish parentage, suffered through SS torture and survived various concentration camps. For the rest of his life, which he ended himself, he did not lose the nightmares of his torment. It was not until the mid-sixties, that he found his voice to impart his experiences in the form of essays on exile, genocide and resistance. Peter Weiss, who had lived in exile most of his life, found his self-expression mainly through painting and theatre productions until he published late in life his major fiction work, Aesthetics of Resistance.<br />This collection of \\"mediations on natural guilt, national victimhood, and the universal consequences of denying the past\\" is a significant socio-political document. Its importance for today's reader goes beyond the concrete German situation. As it addresses more fundamental issues of dealing with a society's traumatic past experiences, Sebald also confronts the need to develop the capacity to heal while learning and sharing the lessons from that past.

Most people who delve into the story will have read HOMINIDS and understand the basic philosophical and scientific concepts presented. Those who have not would be well advised to pick up the first volume before getting too deeply into this one. Otherwise they may miss out on depth and complexity of what is presented.<br />HUMANS is a very entertaining read, fast paced and engaging. There are also very funny moments. The two key representatives, Mary, from \\"our\\" Earth and Ponter, from the Neanderthals' universe, continue to explore their respective realities in a multitude of ways. Ponter `returns' to Canada and Mary has the opportunity to explore the `other side'.  Their continuing dialogue and interaction form the centrepiece of the novel. Subjects range from such topical scientific questions as the impact of the possible collapse the Earth's magnetic field to the exploration of societal structures and human relationships. Above all, discussions return regularly to Mary's religious side of life. Ponter, having reflected on faith as a conundrum for a Neanderthal scientist ever since he left this earth, becomes more deeply drawn to the question of spirituality and morality on his return visit.<br />Sawyer introduces new players to complement the set of characters well know from HOMINIDS. In particular, the Neanderthal women round off the depiction of life in their world. The global leadership in the Neanderthal's universe, the High Gray Council, deliberates at length whether to reopen the portal to the \\"Gliksin\\" world. The opportunities of this new kind of globalization are too tempting to miss. Tentative exploration of cultural, commerce and scientific exchange, however, does not turn out as easy as the proponents might have liked and even anticipated.

Eminent economist (Nobel Prize Winner no less) Joseph Stiglitz has been directly involved with some of the most serious financial crises in recent times. Not limited to academia and economic theory he served in high profile policy positions including as senior VP and chief economist in the World Bank. For me, it's also important that he spent extensive time with people in the affected countries.  The description of modern international economic management: \\"from one's luxury hotel, one can callously impose policies about which one would think twice if one knew the people whose life one was destroying...\\" (p. 24) does not apply to him. His case studies provide the backdrop for his analysis of globalization as well as concrete evidence for some of his critical contentions.  This is not a dry economics book; it is a captivating read that offers a very accessible examination of global economic and financial systems.<br />To position Stiglitz up-front: he is not against globalization - in his estimation it is quality-neutral as a conception and it is here to stay. The aim of his study is to show what lessons need to be learned and applied to make globalization live up to its potential for the majority of the world's populations. The red thread of the book is the examination of the primarily negative impact that globalization has had on many developing countries and the two billion or so poor who live on less than $2/per day.  His reasoning why this has been the case and what is to be done to bring about positive change makes this book an important resource for the critics and the proponents of globalization alike.<br />Due to its vital role in global economics today, he focuses his criticism on the IMF, fundamentally disagreeing with major policies of the Fund as applied by its senior representatives.  But GLOBALIZATION AND ITS DISCONTENTS is much more than a personal rebuke of his former colleagues and associates. Anybody who has worked in and with developing countries, local policy makers and civil societies, will find themselves in tune with many of Stiglitz' salient points. Several times he comments on new strategies being tried out on \\"powerless\\" countries like Ecuador and Romania, too weak to resist the IMF and resulting in the experiment's highly negative consequences for the countries. (p. 203) The East Asia crisis (1997 onwards) features prominently in Stiglitz' account. What went wrong and why didn't the prescribed (IMF) medicines bring the ailing economies back to health?  Other major examples are the `economies in transition' - in particular Russia and the former Soviet Bloc countries.<br />In a summary one cannot do justice to the wealth of information contained in GLOBALIZATION AND ITS DISCONENTS. Stiglitz' analysis follows several major themes. At the core of his arguments stand the dealings of the powerful \\"Washington Consensus\\" - the combined economic and financial force of IMF, World Bank and the US Treasury deciding on the \\"right\\" policies for developing countries. (p. 16) One of his fundamental criticisms of the IMF is that it is no longer transparent in the pursuit of its objectives and that it moved away from its original mandate: \\"The IMF was founded on the belief that there was a need for collective action at the global level for economic stability.\\" However over time, the Fund has taken to \\"champion market supremacy with ideological fervour\\" (p. 12). The IMF was designed to complement the World Bank, whose mandate was \\"reconstruction and development\\" following World War II, now the major international agency for the eradication of poverty. By the 1980s the Fund and the World Bank had become increasingly intertwined with each broadening their range of influence. As a result, while the IMF \\"does not claim expertise in development - yet it does not hesitate to weigh in\\". (p. 34). Within the Fund's primary focus for macro-economics, Stiglitz argues, \\"market fundamentalism\\" has been the economic philosophy of choice with the result that financial institutions and international lenders have usually been the primary winners from each of the major financial crises. Yet, he stresses that the IMF policies are \\"not conspiracy more a reflection of interest & ideology of western financial institutions\\". (p. 130)<br />Another criticism voiced throughout the book is that the IMF prescribed economic remedies tend to be identical whatever the economic and financial crisis encountered: one size fits all. There is hardly any choice for a government in crisis. This approach, combined with the admitted lack of knowledge of the broader development context, can in some cases plunge the country into further recession rather than stimulate recovery. High unemployment in countries without an adequate social safety net is habitually a harmful side effect of the austerity measures imposed on the government by the IMF.  Another victim of these policies is the environment. The wider social and political context of a country or region is often overlooked, Stiglitz contends, resulting in social unrest and worse: IMF-inspired riots. (p.77) Recession and civil strife further set back the development agenda and Stiglitz refers to numerous World Bank studies that confirm his assertions.<br />Stiglitz describes alternative approaches, presenting the evidence based on his own vast experience. His proposals can be subsumed under the term \\"balance\\". For example, any privatization of industry and markets should be gradual and sequenced, and must be balanced with strong institutional and legal structures. Rather than using \\"shock therapy\\" and forcing rapid privatization of capital markets, the \\"gradualist\\" approach ensures better results in the short and longer term (Russia vs. Poland).  In the same vein he recognizes the need for balance between market forces and governmental interventions. He reminds the reader that the advanced industrialized economies all went through growth periods when government regulated the markets and capital flows. He asks that developing countries be given a real and honest chance to sit in the driver's seat when developing locally adapted international economic models.  (Friederike Knabe, Ottawa Canada)\\"market fundamentalism\\" has been the economic philosophy of choice with the result that financial institutions and international lenders have usually been the primary winners from each of the major financial crises. Yet, he stresses that the IMF policies are \\"not conspiracy more a reflection of interest & ideology of western financial institutions\\". (p. 130) <br />Another criticism voiced throughout the book is that the IMF prescribed economic remedies tend to be identical whatever the economic and financial crisis encountered: one size fits all. There is hardly any choice for a government in crisis. This approach, combined with the admitted lack of knowledge of the broader development context, can in some cases plunge the country into further recession rather than stimulate recovery. High unemployment in countries without an adequate social safety net is habitually a harmful side effect of the austerity measures imposed on the government by the IMF.  Another victim of these policies is the environment. The wider social and political context of a country or region is often overlooked, Stiglitz contends, resulting in social unrest and worse: IMF-inspired riots. (p.77) Recession and civil strife further set back the development agenda and Stiglitz refers to numerous World Bank studies that confirm his assertions.<br />Stiglitz describes alternative approaches, presenting the evidence based on his own vast experience. His proposals can be subsumed under the term \\"balance\\". For example, any privatization of industry and markets should be gradual and sequenced, and must be balanced with strong institutional and legal structures. Rather than using \\"shock therapy\\" and forcing rapid privatization of capital markets, the \\"gradualist\\" approach ensures better results in the short and longer term (Russia vs. Poland).

He reminds the reader that the advanced industrializedeconomies all went through growth periods when government regulated the markets and capital flows.

US	51245884	R3DOQTKAYOI6KC	0375726659	814842893	No Great Mischief: A Novel	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Family ties	It is amazing how many stories one can pack into a day.  Alistair McLeod let's his protagonist's mind wander through the lifetime of several generations in just a few hours. What emerges is the absorbing family history and much more.<br />At one level this novel is the story of Alexander MacDonald, his twin sister and their older brothers, belonging to a family of tremendous loyalty and commitment, steeped in tradition and history.  We follow them from early childhood when tragedy befalls them, leaving them orphans, through their adolescent years and to adulthood.<br />At a deeper level, it is a testament to 'blood is thicker than water'. The MacDonalds trace their roots back to the legendary Calum Ruadh (&quot;the red Calum&quot;) and his brood of 12 children who arrived in the New World in the 1770s as one of the early settler families in Cape Breton.<br />The descendents of the founding father, Alexander and his siblings, remain cocooned in the close-knit family, protected by the strength of family ties and values which help them through the sometimes painful dramas in their lives.  The past stays vividly in the minds of all its members; the grandparents reminding the younger generation constantly through stories of lives lived. Time seems &quot;to compress and expand almost simultaneously&quot;; events are repeated to allow the author to present them from different perspectives. Convictions are expressed almost like mottos throughout the novel: &quot;Always look after your own blood&quot; or &quot;We are all better when we're loved&quot;.<br />While Alexander and his sister, living in the relative comfort of their grandparents' home, are encouraged and financially supported in their academic ambitions, the older brothers have to fend for themselves. Poverty is their primary school as they struggle to keep themselves and the farm alive. For the young twins a visit to the brothers is always an adventure where no grown-ups rules apply. McLeod portrays the different characters well - reflecting the particular affection that Alexander has for the grandparents.  Most intriguing is the other grandfather, a quiet and withdrawn man, who lives by himself having lost wife and only daughter through tragedies. Despite his doubts about himself stemming also from the stigma of being a single mother's child whose father died before he was born, he exudes strength and compassion and plays an increasingly important balancing role in the life of the family.<br />To escape increasing financial difficulties, the older brothers leave the island for the uranium mines of Ontario and elsewhere. However, the location of home is never in doubt and it draws them back forcefully. After one of the MacDonald team is killed in the mine, Alexander, having progressed well in his academic studies, drops everything to join the brothers to make up the required number.  His action manifests the strong loyalty to the family while allowing McLeod to continue the narration from Alexander's perspective. Life in the mining community is well drawn in its crudeness and harshness. While there, the MacDonalds are pitched against a group of francophone Quebeckers. Tension and outright hatred between the two leaders add another layer of complexity and provide in the end an explanation for another major story line - the here and now of the day in the life of...<br />McLeod's enthralls the reader with his portrayal of the land of Cape Breton, its history and mores.  It would be difficult to find a more hauntingly beautiful description of the landscape, of the impact that the seasons have on the surroundings and the ever-present power of the sea.

Hartmann's UNEQUAL PROTECTION is a great case study: here, it's one person, a court reporter, who changed history with a set of &quot;headnotes&quot;. Thom Hartmann discusses the case of J. C. Bancroft Davis and his impact on globalization today in his fascinating study on the rise of corporate dominance around the world. At the same time, and in the spirit of Margaret Mead, he also calls for grassroots and community action.<br />Hartmann's starting point is the question: How did corporations manage to become persons before the law with, at least, the same rights as human beings?  How did corporations change from being &quot;virtual entities&quot;, meaning that they were subject to the controls and supervision by local governments (and humans), into becoming legal entities equal to citizens but without the restrictions and responsibilities placed on people. How have &quot;multinational corporations become the tail that wags the dogs of governments of the world&quot;?  Well it's the result of a US Supreme Court Decision regarding the Fourteenth Amendment. Or is it?<br />Hartmann delves deep into US Constitutional history to set the framework in which the fundamental issue of corporate personhood has to be understood. He traces the concept to its roots in 1886, and to court reporter Davis, the official recorder for the Supreme Court Case: The Southern Pacific Railroad vs. the Santa Clara County. Corporate personhood was introduced during this case, but not, as constitutional and corporate lawyers have assumed for some 120 years, by the Court  - but by David in the headnotes. That meant it had no legal basis whatsoever. The evidence found by Hartmann confirmed that the Supreme Court specifically decided NOT to rule on the issue of corporate personhood.<br />Hartmann explores possible reasons why this application of the Fourteenth Amendment became so popular with corporate lawyers. He also states categorically that &quot;he is not looking for culprits but to point out a flaw in the social system.&quot;<br />The impact of the misinterpretation of the Supreme Court decision since 1886 has been fundamental and has reached far beyond the United States. Hartmann traces American history from &quot;the birth of American democracy through the birth of corporate personhood&quot; ending with the rise of transnational corporations and their role in world trade. He reflects on the emerging conflicts between government and corporations, citing no lesser authority than President Thomas Jefferson and his conviction that &quot;freedom from monopolies are one of the fundamental human rights&quot;.<br />Hartmann devotes a chapter to the analysis of the &quot;unequal consequences&quot; on all major aspects of civil rights and responsibilities: protection from risk, taxes, wealth, trade and (political) influence, to list a selection.  He concludes on a more positive note with a call to all concerned to redress the power balance and to restore the sharing of responsibility for the Global Commons.  This book should be essential reading for all interested in and concerned in our modern trade systems, whether in the US, in other countries or globally. This well researched study is a dramatic read and leaves the reader with ample food for thought.ible reasons why this application of the Fourteenth Amendment became so popular with corporate lawyers.

He presents the reader with a different view on life on earth - but not from the usual perspective of 'aliens' coming from outer space as he has done in previous novels. He imagined an alternative hominid reality - that of the Neanderthals - existing in parallel with ours.<br />Ponter Bobbit, a physicist in this parallel universe, literally drops into ours, seemingly out of nowhere and is found floating in a tank of heavy water. An accident in his quantum computing department opens up a brief window between the two realities. The people in the science lab in Sudbury, (Ontario) were taken by surprise, to say the least. They require some time to work out who he is and what his appearance represents. This is the hook that leads to a clever and imaginative description of human (homo sapiens) attitudes vis-&agrave;-vis the unexpected. An engaging story of sharing and mutual learning from both realities in this multiverse develops from there. In particular the exchange between Mary Vaughan, the geneticist brought in to examine the Neanderthal's DNA, and Ponter explore some pretty fundamental issues in both societies.<br />While Ponter is learning how to communicate with an ethnically diverse group of homo sapiens, in his Neanderthal reality his disappearance leads to a completely different set of problems. A small pool of heavy water provides the only hint of something having gone wrong. But, a person cannot really disappear thanks to the \\"alibi archives\\" that record where everybody is at any time.  So, his friend and colleague, Adikor Huld, is charged with his murder. Alternating this second storyline with the first, Sawyer uses Adikor's case to share with the reader his vision of a completely different social reality.<br />The dissimilar worldviews are constantly juxtaposed. Ponter brings his experiences and perceptions into our reality and, having mastered the language, confronts fundamental issues delving deeply into all aspects of human experiences - from religion to science to interpersonal behaviour. Mary becomes his responsive interlocutor.<br />Sawyer bases himself on thorough and wide-ranging research into paleoanthropology, evolution, Neanderthals' fossil evidence and more. He develops a vision on how a Neanderthal civilization might have evolved and drawing interesting conclusions from  starting from the fundamental differences of a non-agrarian, hunter-gatherer society.<br /><br />This is a fun book to read. It flows well, the characters are drawn with empathy and sensitivity and the two parallel realities that deal with Ponter's appearance and disappearance respectively give ample food for thought as well as reasons for smiles. Read it now as the second volume of the trilogy is already on its way.d, having mastered the language, confronts fundamental issues delving deeply into all aspects of human experiences - from religion to science to interpersonal behaviour.

She lives a reasonably comfortable life thanks to the inheritance of her father's house and a job as a local schoolteacher. Through her diary entries and exchanges of letters, mainly with her more glamorous younger sister Nora, Clara reveals herself to the reader. Wright has created a believable character that &quot;grows on you&quot; as her personality emerges little by little. Life's difficulties during the Depression years, in particular for a single woman in rural Southern Ontario become apparent through the description of daily events. However, a very dramatic personal incident and its aftermath force Clara to confront her new circumstances in a very direct manner.  While she was accustomed  to express her daily experiences and reflections in poems, events interfere and poetry becomes impossible. She recognizes &quot;how suddenly a life can become misshapen, divided brutally into before and after a dire event.&quot;  Her beliefs are challenged and so is her self-contained whole-ness as a person.<br />Clara's personal story is embedded in the realities of the mid-thirties where unemployment is rife and poverty spreading.  Although at the periphery of the main thrust of the book, Wright alludes to the emerging pre-war anxieties. He touches on the contrasts between city and rural living, utilizing Clara's reluctance to accept such innovations as the telephone, as an example. Yet, the regular Saturday trips to Toronto, perceived by her as a necessary escape from the village, lead to a new, important phase in her personal development, giving her also a new taste of independence.  She visits her sister in New York, although in rather difficult time in her life. Cleverly, Wright lets her visit pre-war Italy as a third party to her sister's vacation.  It allows the author to add impressions of the growing political conflicts in Europe as a backdrop without losing the focus of the story.<br />The counterweight to Clara is Nora, who could not bear small-town Ontario and leaves for New York to &quot;make it in radio&quot;.  She becomes successful as a radio voice in daytime &quot;soaps&quot; and her personal life seems to take on some aspects of a soap opera itself.  Nora is privileged in finding a solid rock in a glamorous female friend, Evelyn, while her on and off affairs are far less successful. Clara, always concerned about her sister and her superficial lifestyle, attempts to remain the firm family base for her sister, but her own life story places her more and more on a shaky ground. She finds advice and empathy through her correspondence with Evelyn.<br />Clara Callan is a very engaging story indeed.

It also establishes a methodology for reporting farmer and community initiatives to a wider international audience. Agriculture has been around in Africa for a very long time.  Early domestication of such staples as wheat and barley took place in Africa, coffee originated there and many food crops and plants still maintain their highest levels of biodiversity anywhere.  Above all else then, FARMER INNOVATION is a testimony to creativity, originality and resilience of small-scale men and women farmers in different parts of Africa. As the editors state, what they found and are reporting on represents 'just the tip of the iceberg'; even then they identified over 1,000 innovators during the two-year study.<br />Reij and Waters-Bayer have gathered evidence of farmer innovation from more than a dozen countries in East, West and Southern Africa. Their research was a collaborative effort with two major, Dutch-funded, regional development programs.  The individual field reports followed a clear set of selection criteria and reporting standards.  The editors provided the framework, introduction and conclusion and invited a number of research and extension teams, mainly African, to present the individual case studies.  The result is the portrayal of  'best farming practices' introduced and/or refined by African men and women farmers, which have proven successful against environmental and economic adversity.<br />The book is grouped by themes and relevant case studies from each region are summarized. For example, we find a report on how farmers &quot;increase and diversify plant biomass&quot; through the development of planting pits in Burkina Faso, or the use of such pits for improved maize production in southern Tanzania.  &quot;Farmer-to-farmer communication&quot; among communities in Tigray (Ethiopia) facilitates the spreading of effective land management techniques, proving that building partnerships and sharing knowledge is an important practical trait of farmer innovators.  Farmer Innovators do not work in isolation and their ideas and experiments can have a major impact on the neighbouring community and beyond.  It will be important to study lessons from these experiences to influence policy and political and economic leaders: small-scale farmers have an important role to play if agriculture in Africa is to be successful and sustainable. In their concluding chapter, the editors also raise questions regarding the prevailing north-south technology transfer that has been the mainstay of African agricultural development intervention.<br />FARMER INNOVATION, although not a difficult read, is more designed for the research, extension and agriculture/development community than for the general audience.  In order to demonstrate the consistency of their methodology, the editors allow for a certain amount of repetitive description of the consultation and investigation processes involved.  The case studies themselves should motivate the reader to persevere.

However, in NIGHTWATCH, we are discovering something like the program's temporal prime directive. It is one thing to be transported 30 years back in time through some magical fluke.  It something else to ensure that events there do/will not distort the present. The present is a past and will lead to a future.  What would you be coming back to?<br />Sir Samuel Vimes, the Commander of the City Watch in Ankh Morpork, is catapulted out of the present at a sensitive and important moment in his personal life.  Together with the criminal Carcer, who he was about to arrest, he is transported into an earlier, smaller and much less organized city.  It would not be true to his character if he just laid low while waiting and hoping to get back to the present/future.  Disguised as another copper, he involves himself in the city's business.  He meets a number of well-known Discworld luminaries in their earlier selves, from Nobby Nobbs and Fred Colon to a smart young Havelock Vetinari and learns how Reg Shoe becomes a zombie.  And, of course, we encounter the young Sam Vimes who is still very na√Øve. He is in need of a role model and hero and Vimes, the older and still disguised, has to step into the part.  Suffice to say, that the events are unfolding in good Pratchett fashion.  Sam Vimes is in the thick of it - a rebellion to be precise.<br />As a result of Vimes and Carcer's presence, events happen not quite as they were suppose to have happened. That is where the temporal prime directive becomes an important aspect leading us to a more reflective and pondering Sam.  He knows how history will report the past that he is reliving, but not as himself.  Will he jeopardize his own future if he tweaks reality in the past?  Will there be his wife, Sybil, and the child yet to be born?...  Those familiar with Pratchett's Discworld will remember time shifts and alignments and those who tinker with them in THIEF OF TIME. Not surprising therefore that the Sweeper has to make an appearance, this time accompanied by a character similar to one in Star Trek - playing with time and space.  To find out about the importance of lilac, you have to read the book.<br />NIGHTWATCH is a great book - rich in the story and the reflections on politics, power, violence and teamwork.  And of course, Pratchett's famous and unsurpassed one-liners, such as, when referring to the old Watch &quot;in the sea of adventure, you're bottom-feeders&quot;.

De Villiers and Hirtle have criss-crossed this vast expanse and its surrounding regions extensively over many years. Their intimate knowledge of land and people permeates the book. Exposing the reader to a multitude of colours, smells, shapes, sounds - they relate all facets of the landscape and its inhabitants. Readers with any knowledge or interest in this geographic region will find SAHARA a treasure trove.  Having followed some of the desert tracks and visiting quite a few of the places portrayed, I was quickly drawn back into the magic of it all: the white sand dunes of Ouargla, the palm oases of the M'zab and the complex rich history of Timbuktu and the Niger river.<br />In conveying the richness and diversity of the landscapes in their historical evolution, the authors combine travel descriptions from the Middle Ages with those written by explorers in more recent times. De Villiers and Hirtle ground themselves on famous travel writers, starting with Ibn Battuta who recorded his travels in the region in the mid-fourteenth century, Leo Africanus in the early 15th and the accounts of early European explorers since the late eighteenth century, such as Heinrich Barth, who spent six years among the Tuareg in the deep Sahara. Their own experiences mix seamlessly with that of the other travellers and all in all build a comprehensive picture. At times, one would have preferred to be able to distinguish between de Villiers' and Hirtle's travels and that of the others.<br /><br />SAHARA is, however, not a 'travelogue' and even though travels in many directions are vividly described, the emphasis of the book is, as the subtitle suggests, the natural history of the Sahara.  The overriding perspective is historical, to the point that the reader is taken on a journey through time as well as place. The authors succeed in evoking the intricate bond between the land, its scarce resources and the Saharan peoples who have managed to survive there for at least a thousand years.<br />In the first part of the book - the Place Itself - De Villiers and Hirtle approach the Sahara from various angles: the sand seas, the winds, the water and the massifs. Each aspect is vital for our understanding of the progression of the Sahara as a desert. They also explain why and how life continues to thrive despite the many adversities.  A particularly fascinating chapter is the one on water: the description of unexpected springs, surprising waterfalls in hidden valleys as well as huge aquifers underground.  The authors follow the Tuareg and other desert wanderers in search of water and remark on the intricate knowledge systems related to this source of life. They address the impact of global climate change on the Sahara's desert expansion as well as the reciprocal impact of Saharan landmass on the global climate. For example, indications are accumulating that suggest a direct link between the rain patterns in the Sahara and the development of hurricanes that batter the East coast of the USA.<br />The second part of the book - The People who live there - describes the historical roots of today's societies.  The reader discovers the highly developed civilizations of West and Central Africa, going back some 900 years, their culture and commerce. The acceptance of or confrontation with Islam played an important role in their societies' development. Their commerce and trade was based on salt and gold and it explains the economic wealth of these ancient empires.  The early trading routes established regular contacts between peoples from Morocco via the ancient Ghana (with the capital in what is now Mauritania) via Mali, Niger and Lake Chad to Egypt. Although no longer as important, the trading routes continue to move goods and people today. De Villiers and Hirtle offer us insights into a fascinating mosaic of cultures, peoplesand personalities of rulers and leaders. Many of the earlier ethnic groups and tribes have disappeared, most likely absorbed by conquering peoples. The Tuareg are among the best-known surviving groups today. They are the proud and mysterious traditional rulers (or bandits) of the deep Sahara who continue to play an important political and cultural role across the borders of  Algeria, Mauritania, Mali and Niger.<br />Among the few weaknesses of the book are the endnotes, which are somewhat too short providing only a brief overview of sources and reference materials. There is a certain amount of duplication in the description of aspects of life and history of the Saharan peoples between chapters and the index is important for checking the cross-references.<br />Some reviewers have argued that the description is too \\"dry\\". This is not a book for the novice or unappreciative visitor of deserts. But for anybody interested in drylands in general and deserts in particular (or fascinated by them), SAHARA is a fascinating journey into the depth of the continent, its history and the life of the people in the arid lands.s and personalities of rulers and leaders.

The first part of the book covers one hot summer day in rural England in 1935 where the tragedy unfolds. The atmosphere is masterfully evoked and the evolving drama sensitively depicted.  To this reader the most successful facet of the chapter and the novel overall is the characterization of Briony. In many ways, this is Her story, seen from different angles and from different time perspectives. She is, as the late arrival to her parents, a typical mix of a spoilt and neglected child. She lives in her own fantasy world where the realities of her surroundings are mixed in with the wild imaginations of a romantic of her age.  McEwan captures the capricious teenager very well indeed.  He also paints an excellent portrait of the upper-middleclass family and its open and hidden frustrations and tensions.  Cecilia is also well drawn as the returning fresh (women's) college graduate. She tends to replace the mother for Briony and a set of cousins, but at the same time she is uncertain of her own identity.  This part of the book is the most engaging, it draws the characters well and builds up the tension up to the 'crime'.<br />The rest of the novel does not maintain the momentum created. The story picks up five years later with Robbie at the front in France after having spent the intervening years in prison for THE crime, which he did not commit. Briony, obviously in part as a result of her guilt for blaming Robbie rather than the real aggressor in a false testimony, has decided to train as a nurse in London.  We also learn that her actions resulted in her sister refusing to communicate with her and the rest of the family.<br />One wonders why the very detailed description of the retreat from the front to Dunkirk with a wounded Robbie as the main character was necessary. Based on extensive research of historical documents, McEwan offers an excellent account of the dramas of that retreat, however, its significance for this particular story is not evident.  The incidental facts one learns about the intervening years, the protagonists and their changed relationships do not justify the importance given to this chapter.  The exception is the description of Briony's life as a nurse which is more to the point.  An extensive duty period where she is suddenly confronted with the dramatic influx of seriously wounded soldiers leaves a deep impression. The learning curve that changes her from an innocent and irresponsible 18 year old to an adult during those hours is well drawn.  Her actions following this experience, although somewhat unconvincing, are intended to demonstrate her resolve to confront her 'atonement'.<br />The novel ends with an epilogue set some 55 years later. It depicts Briony as a successful writer of a certain age.  While preparing for a birthday party in her honour, she reflects not only on her life but also on the question of atonement.  I agree with those reviewers who commented on the weakness of the ending of the novel.  The concept of a story in a story and the author's privilege to change major aspects of the story line to give it more of 'happy ending', does not sound quite convincing. Atonement is not achieved by making the characters survive and live happily ever after.  Briony, even at 77, remains the capricious little person that she was at 13.  She still invents fantasies and refuses to take responsibility for her actions.front to Dunkirk with a wounded Robbie as the main character was necessary.

The short answer to Homer-Dixon's question in the subtitle of his book &quot;Can we solve the problems of the future?&quot; is: it depends.  INGENUITY GAP is an exploration of a large number of major and increasingly complex problems facing human society. We will require all the ingenuity and political will that we can muster to deal with these successfully. An ingenuity gap is the difference between &quot;the set of instructions&quot; needed to find solutions for specific problems and the capacity of the people, community or state to take the right actions in solving them. As the problems become increasingly multifaceted the development of the matching sets of instructions require more talent and competence.<br />Ingenuity comes in two forms - technical and social. One without the other will not provide us with lasting solutions.  Technical solutions might even lead us down a garden path without complementary social ingenuity. It is the latter that guarantees results taking economic, ecological and cultural needs into account. To make his point, Homer-Dixon explores a wide range of examples demonstrating tremendous levels of ingenuity at work all over the world - both technical and social. His contention is that they are available to us if we look properly.<br />H-D, or Tad as he is usually called, takes us on a tour around the planet, using concrete examples to amplify his argument. Obviously, the result is not your usual travelogue and we are not visiting popular vacation spots or tourist attractions. Visiting Vegas, London's Canary Wharf or Patna, India, he believes that a personalized approach facilitates the following of his arguments. While some reviewers have criticized that H-D places himself too much into the story, it nonetheless contributes to the readability of the often exceedingly complicated issues he is addressing.  He also conveys his own learning through interviews with some of the foremost scientists in the various fields he covers: from soil scientists to climatologists, from computer science to economy and architecture.<br />His in depth deductions from the wide range of interviews with scientists represent one of the highlights of the book. For example, while exploring the latest research into the human brain as the central point for ingenuity development, Tad takes his questions to one of the world's leading experts on frontal lobes, Donald Stuss. His conversations with Stuss provide fascinating insights in the importance of frontal lobe abilities to process change and integrate experiences and learning. This part of the brain handles our creative and intellectual capabilities. With aging, the ability of the brain to absorb new information lessens while the ability to digest and process complex interrelationships increases. His conclusions are far reaching - changing the way we assess leadership and identify those who are best qualified to meet the challenges of our corporate and administrative hierarchies.  After each of these in-depth conversations, H-D reflects on the substance of the dialogue and returns to his overall theme - how can we minimize the ingenuity gap that is widening all the time.<br />Tad groups his book into sections, each addressing different aspects and disciplines from which to review the ingenuity requirements of the modern world. He depicts environmental problems and those related to continuing rapid population growth, which to him is a major challenge for the planet's future. He does not have a lot of patience with the 'economic optimists' or the 'techno-hubris'. He expands on incidences which demonstrate that a single-minded and, in some way, na√Øve belief that technological advance alone is capable of solving the world's problems will fail.<br />It's impossibleto do justice here to the many strands of global analysis that Homer-Dixon presents the reader with. His many years of research, in particular into environmental scarcity and civil violence allow him to assess ingenuitygaps from many different angles. The criticism that he does not supply adequate answers and does not show a way forward, is oversimplifying what H-D is attempting to achieve. The modern world is at a level of complexity that no one person can comprehend. As a consequence, it will take the ingenuity and political will of many to address the wide range of issues confronting us. In the pursuit of answers, he urges intellectual humility and thinking outside the box.  He encourages his readers to take up the challenges, explore them further, and question any simple or easy solutions being offered by political leaders. This is an important reference book to be read more than once.genuity gaps from many different angles.

US	51245884	R2KYEHQQ27LAOV	1565847318	75199562	Blue Gold: The Fight to Stop the Corporate Theft of the World's Water	Books	4	40	43	N	N	Threats to Blue Gold	There are not many surprises in BLUE GOLD.  The primary message of Maud Barlow and Tony Clarke's book echoes the Blue Planet Project, a global campaign to assert the universal right to water, of which Barlow is one of the international leaders. It is the 'battle against the corporate world' - here in particular the 'theft of the world's water'.  Of course, it is not so much a 'theft' of water - the world's water supply has been more or less stable since the beginning of time - rather the increasing control by a small group of multinationals over the water's allocation to the peoples of this planet.<br />Consequently, the strength of the book is in its coverage of the multi-national corporations, the 'Global Water Lords', and the exposure of their expanding power over water delivery and processing systems around the globe. Initiatives to privatize water delivery at a national level probably started with Napoleon III in France in the middle of the 19th century.  At that time, governments were usually in charge of water management. Since then privatization has spread from France to the rest of the world. Today,  Barlow and Clarke maintain, some 10 corporate players dominate the global water industry. Two French companies hold the lion's share. Most of these major players are multi-utility providers, which increase their hold on the water resources of countries and regions. Once a government opens a door to privatization of any of the water related services, such as water delivery or waste management, it abandons its right to take back control at any stage even if water user groups complain about bad or no service or the company does not live up to the contract. The rules and regulations of the WTO see to that, the authors claim. Although the percentage of national water systems controlled by multi-national corporations at the present time is small, Barlow and Clarke want to warn of the trend and its implication.<br />Examples are described where things have gone wrong: poor quality of project implementation resulted in water pollution and environmental damage, and/or communities and local business lost the water supply altogether. In these instances corporate water suppliers maintained their profit margin through cutting back in previously promised investments and/or increasing consumer rates. The latter was implemented without any regard to the capacity of the poor to pay. As a result, they could be cut off from the service.<br />Barlow and Clarke's analysis of the progression of the global water crisis and its origins is less satisfactory.  A reader unfamiliar with complex topic of water might find the tour d'horizon overwhelming. The review of the diversity of root causes at local, national and regional levels is superficial and tends to present generalizations where concrete examples would have been more meaningful. The tendency to paint a black and white picture with big business as the main villain sidelines other major reasons for water crises around the world. Agriculture is only mentioned in passing, although some 70% of all water resources are used by agriculture: agribusiness and millions of small-scale and mid-size farmers across industrialized and developing countries. Implementing water conservation methods (through improved irrigation, drought tolerant crops, etc) could lead to substantial water resource savings.<br />Recent initiatives against global corporate water control highlighted in the section 'Fightback' are selective, emphasizing well-known international as well as North American cases. The approach is usually confrontational with clearly identified opposing sides. Examples of constructive multi-stakeholder collaboration efforts in many parts of the world which attempt to tackle water scarcity are not given enough recognition.<br />The 'Way Forward' spells out fundamental principles and recommends a series of standards that should be included in any agreement of public-private partnerships in the water delivery sphere. These include the involvement of water users in the planning of the systems, local stewardship and watershed protection, strengthen water preservation and reclaiming of polluted water systems.  Underlying all these standards is the recognition of water as an essential part of life and the right of all beings to water whatever their social or economic status.  A call for capacity building and education of consumers, communities, government officials and private sector actors at all levels should be added.<br />BLUE GOLD is an easy read, maybe for some too easy considering the seriousness of the topic. It covers very important ground, often in an overview fashion that tends to generalize and take a black and white stand. Although it is obvious that the authors did comprehensive research in preparation of the book, it shows a certain lack of thoroughness by not providing citation references (footnotes), adequate source listings and a bibliography or reading list.r delivery sphere.

Books	5	8	8	N	Y	More crop per drop - fewer drops for all	Sandra Postel goes well beyond a simple answer to the question posed by her subtitle 'Can the Irrigation Miracle last?'  This book is an important resource for anybody trying to understand why water scarcity is such a major and escalating problem at the dawn of this century.  Rather than adding to the generalist debate of the economists on water as a commodity or the projection into future problems presented by policy analysts and environmentalists, Postel analyzes particular examples in the past to explain the present and to make recommendations for the future.<br />Postel opens by reviewing major early societies in history, from Mesopotamia to Babylon, Egypt to ancient China, showing how they developed into major civilizations and why they fell.  Yes, fell.  Almost all great irrigation-based civilizations (Egypt being a rare exception) collapsed as a result of reallocation and overuse of water resources resulting in salinization, silting, soil degradation, etc.<br />Have we learned any lessons form the past? Postel argues that it does not seem so. She gives a factual account of a wide range of irrigation systems of the modern era, comparing methodologies and results to those in the past. The development of huge irrigation areas in India (Punjab), China and the US have either already demonstrated a repeat of the old mistakes or will do so in the near future.  The groundwater tables are overused without being replenished and aquifers are tapped that have little chance to recover even in the long term.  She describes two kinds of water wars: farms versus cities and nature and irrigation versus water scarcity. Water is reallocated and shifted from one use to another, but in some way, we are all living downstream from somebody else. Robbing Peter to pay Paul has its limits: the earth's fresh water resources are finite.<br />Against the backdrop of increasing water scarcity around the globe, Postel sees as humanity's main challenge the growing of enough food for our future population in a sustainable manner. She describes the pitfalls and the short-term fixes that will result in even greater problems in the future. At the same time, given the substantial increase in crop yield thanks to irrigation, she is realistic in her assessment that agriculture will not be able to do without it.  As a result, the objective will have to be to reduce the amount of water we use for agriculture while at the same time producing more crop per drop of water.<br />Postel has traveled the world to review water systems, big and small, wasteful and efficient.  Water needs saving in all areas of use, industrial, private and in agriculture. As agriculture uses by far the most of the global water resources, savings here will have major impacts down the line. She demonstrates on the basis of examples and statistics what is possible and how irrigation in agriculture can become highly effective and water conserving and restraint. She touches on the need to develop 'water-thrifty' plants, but, unfortunately, does not examine the traditional African crop varieties that are known to be drought tolerant and pest resistant. Postel appears to underestimate the importance of crop biodiversity; focusing on 'major' crops like wheat, maize and rice.  Traditional farming systems developed in the earth's drylands could teach modern agriculture some important lessons.<br />Her main conclusion is that water management systems, whether public or private are most successful when they involve the local users and are based on a fair sharing of water resources at the community levels.  Water markets and water trading provide options for the future as long as there is a fair and equitable basis for water access and use.<br />'Pillar of Sand' is clearly presented and easy to read.  It will remain an important book in the intensifying debates around water use and mis-use, the increasing tension around demands between agriculture and other uses, and the privatization of water resource systems and the right of human beings to have the essential water they need to live.ter resource systems and the right of human beings to have the essential water they need to live.	2002-08-23

With the debate around water scarcity expanding across the globe, Vandana Shiva's Water Wars is an important book to read. With it, she has produced another collection of thought-provoking and well-researched essays.  A physicist turned environmental activist, Shiva has a passion for the &quot;essence of life&quot;.  Water, she argues, is intrinsically different from other resources and products and can NOT be treated simply as a commodity: without water people and the environment cannot survive.  To subject water to commercial restrictions and to control its availability to people and communities is unacceptable.<br />Vandana Shiva discusses the failures and successes of diverse water management systems, past and present.  She builds her case by reviewing traditional water systems and evaluating the impact of modern dam building. She examines the recent and current conflicts around water and access controls between countries and peoples.  Contrary to others who claim that water scarcity will lead to conflicts in the future, Shiva brings evidence that water wars are already with us and are happening all over the world.  She is furthermore convinced, based on her research, that conflicts will become increasingly violent as fresh water resources dwindle.<br />Destruction of fragile ecosystems and the displacement of people and communities have resulted from the construction of the huge dams, so popular in the sixties to the eighties. She describes the impacts of some of the best-known big dams in India, the United States, Mexico, and China.  Using her in-depth knowledge of the Indian Subcontinent she strengthens her arguments with many examples from that region.  But she has also studied the conflicts surrounding the Rio Grande rerouting and the big Hoover Dam that has channeled huge amounts of water from Texas and other crop growing regions to satisfy the ever-increasing water hunger of California.<br />For some readers, Vandana Shiva's focus on Indian examples of water system mismanagement may seem a bit tedious.  However, it is worth persisting as there are important lessons to be learned from her examples, in particular, as numerous successful projects have also emerged from India.  The successful traditional and present-day initiatives, which she cites, are primarily based on locally managed and community controlled water systems.  Experience in many developing countries confirm her conclusions that water is most valued and best preserved for people and environment when managed at the community level with user participation.  The chapter 'Food and Water' is a reminder and warning of the fragility of our food production systems.<br />Privatization of water resources and systems is a major concern to many and Vandana Shiva adds her strong voice. The World Bank estimated the potential water market at $1trillion.  Shiva cites examples where the privatization of water has resulted in profits for a minority while increasing the economic burden on the poor. She warns of the consequences if water scarcity develops into a marketing opportunity for private business and transnational corporations.<br />Vandana Shiva's focus on ethics does not come as a surprise to the reader. Her 'Principles of Water Democracy' take a strong stand for water rights in the current debate whether water is a &quot;human need&quot; or a &quot;human right&quot;.  She ends with a reminder that water sources have been sacred throughout history.  If we were to understand 'value' without its monetary connotation, usually implicit these days, we could treasure natural resources like water and biodiversity without a price tag - as major elements of the global common. This well-researched and well-written book should be read, whatever side of the current debate the reader may be.of water system mismanagement may seem a bit tedious.

Sandra Postel published LAST OASIS - FACING WATER SCARCITY  back in 1992, year of the RIO Conference on Development and Environment, also called the Earth Summit.  Re-issued in 1997 (with a new introduction) it formed the basis for a PBS documentary in the series \\"Cadillac Desert\\".  Is it still relevant today?  So much has been written on water issues since, from environmental concerns to promoting the privatization of water, that the question is valid.<br /><br />Still, as we approach the 10-year review conference of RIO in Johannesburg, politicians, government officials, economists, environment and development experts and activists meet to take stock of what happened to the many promises of RIO - reflected in Agenda 21.  In this context, it is interesting and useful to read LAST OASIS with a view to weighing the global water situation today against the problems and possible solutions outlined ten years ago.<br />Postel, a long-time specialist in environmental issues, traveled across the globe to review problem areas as well as conservation initiatives and solutions first hand. In addition to giving us an overview of the problems, she also outlined projects and initiatives representing a variety of approaches to address the challenges: either by living with and adapting to water scarcity or by finding solutions for preserving and replenishing the finite clean water resources available to us.<br />When it was published, Postel presented a comprehensive examination of the causes for water scarcity across the globe.  Although not up-to-date anymore in terms of statistics, her analyis of the issues and her review of  danger zones have not lost relevance. We are still facing the same dramatic divide: On the one hand, close to one billion people live without access to clean water and their daily requirements can only be met through enormous physical strain, in particular on women and girls who are the traditional water carriers. The inaquate water resources threaten the mere survival of the majority of the world's poor who live on the land and off the land to secure their livelihood with small-scale subsistence agriculture. On the other hand, water in industrialized societies, and also increasingly by the elites around the world, is treated as a cheap commodity: too often wasted and its safety jeopardized through carelessness and/or through industrial pollution. A major culprit in the long term destruction of safe water resources was then and remains today large scale agro-business.  Postel argues the reasons for that and also reviews alternative and small-scale systems that have proven to be successful in delivering good crops as well as reducing the strain on the soil and the water table. Postel's 1999 book \\"Pillar of Sand\\" focusses on irrigation systems.<br />It is only unfortunate that the book was not updated in 1997 (or since).  Some of the encouraging initiatives Postel described were \\"pending\\" or in progress and it would be good to know if any of them have come to fruition.<br />Is LAST OASIS still relevant today?  Yes, it should be in any collection of books for those interested in and concerned with this most fundamental of environmental issues. It is a good starting point for informed debate on the future of water availability and safety. Will future generations debate a right to clean and adequate water ?  Postel's call for a new ethics on water and the development of a \\"water security\\" system do not go quite that far, but she makes a strong case for it.  She argues on two major fronts. Water conservation can be achieved and encouraged through \\"proper pricing\\" of water and by creating incentives for wise water use. If industries, and in particular agriculture had to pay the real cost of water, efficient and ecological systems would be designed. Complementing this policy of water  pricing would be a new \\"water ethic\\". This ethic would focus on our responsibility for comprehensive water ecological systems; it would have to accommodate our short-term needs for water with our long-term responsibility for water conservation. Postel knows that this ethic would require a major philosophical shift and that it would lead to other fundamental questions on quality of life, on the need to bridge the gap between the haves and the have-nots.  It would change the agenda for economic growth towards ecologically based sustainable development.to accommodate our short-term needs for water with our long-term responsibility for water conservation.

It is July 1945, the time of the Potsdam Conference.  Kanon' s ability to take you virtually by the hand and to lead you through a place is exemplary.  Here, it is particularly dramatic: ruins, bombed out houses, roads blocked by rubble, empty spaces where, before, Berliners had lived - and where the protagonist himself had lived as a journalist.  Jake Geismar, supposedly reporting on the Conference, is really in Berlin fulfilling a promise, a quest. Kanon's portrayal of Berlin is accurate - based on visits to the modern Berlin and his in depth research of the Berlin at the end of WWII and the changes since then.  You could easily use it as a tour guide of a different kind.<br />But of course, Berlin of 1945 is not the story. The story of the returning US journalist and his German girlfriend leads the reader like a red thread through the book. Her family is mixed in with the plot.  The description of day-to-day life in difficult times gives the story reality and perspective.  People do a lot just for a package of cigarettes.<br />Jake's search for his love of the happier pre-war days through the ruins, the alleyways, is becoming increasingly desperate.  Is she still alive?  Where would she be?  Finding an individual in those early post-war months in Germany was almost impossible; no records were available, the houses where they had lived often destroyed and no forwarding address - unless you were really lucky.<br />The story unfolds slowly at first, a hushed-up murder, and several dead-end leads. But things turn out to be a lot more complex as you go: more deaths and threats, intrigue and false allies. And the tension grows.  It is a thriller after all: a thriller with political messages as well as interesting character developments.  In addition to Jake, the protagonist, and Lena, his girlfriend, we meet intriguing characters, in particular among the Germans. While the Russians dismantled factories, taking home whatever technology they could find, a special team from the US's occupying forces were rounding up the scientists and experts who designed the technology in the first place. The Russians realized the problem and tried to get in on the act.  Would it work? So, who is the Good German?<br />The events around the Potsdam Conference provide a useful backdrop. It fits the story well to observe the increasing tension between US and Soviet soldiers who easily turn to an exchange of gunfire to mask more sinister intentions.  The context is the beginnings of the next war (the Cold War), at least in the minds of some US officials and military.<br />Kanon's book is in a category of its own.  More than a thriller and more than a romantic story, it is a skillfully put together account of a complex situation in a difficult moment of time. It is successful as \\"a good read\\" and as a chronicle of events that gives the reader food for thought and reflection.in particular among the Germans.

A Past in Hiding is the story of Marianne Strauss-Ellenbogen and her extraordinary survival during the Holocaust.  Presenting us with one young woman's real life story, Roseman does not paint a picture of a saint but that of a real flesh and blood person who, like us all, had great strengths and also weaknesses.  She was, after all, in her teens when she was confronted with events too difficult for her to comprehend. She was only a couple of years older than Anne Frank, but what a different reality!  Roseman's investigation into Marianne's history engages us deeply in the day-to-day life of herself, her family and friends. We can follow how and why they misjudged the increasingly dangerous environment they lived in.<br />The book has a lot more to offer than that. Given Roseman's extensive knowledge of modern German history, he is able to draw a multi-layered picture of every day life for the Jewish community in Germany during the Nazi period.  The investigation into the role of the Abwehr in protecting selected Jewish Germans is pertinent for the recent debate around the complicity of the regular army with the SS and Gestapo. Moving between historical chronology and present day commentary and personal reflection on Marianne, the author pieces together a mosaic like a jigsaw puzzle. For most readers it will shed new light on the complexities of this period in recent history like very few other books I have read.<br />Roseman writes in a style that combines the historical with the intimate personal.  He conveys his assessment of the characters and situations with empathy for their situation and struggles.  At the time he reflects on discrepancies in their statements and recollections of the past. One of the most dramatic documents in the book is the diary of Marianne's fianc&eacute;, Ernst.  He was able to smuggle it out of the concentration camp Izbica thanks to an unconventional courier. One of the family acquaintances with probable links to the Gestapo, was nevertheless willing to act as courier for parcels from Marianne to Ernst; he also brought back this very rare contemporary account of life in the camp. Roseman digs into historical records to verify and complement the description.  As part of his investigation, he interviewed the courier's widow as well as others who could add to the story.<br />I started reading A Past in Hiding primarily because, as a child growing up after the war,  I knew some of the people connected with Marianne and the \\"Bund\\".  It was Bund members who provided shelter to Marianne while she was on the run from 1943 to 1945, thus risking their own lives and security.  The Bund was a small but committed group of humanitarians and socialists who helped numerous victims of the Holocaust. One of the survivors protected by the Bund, Lisa Jacob, became a friend of my family. She influenced my life more than she ever knew and also much more than even I understood for many years while growing up.  However, my interest in this extraordinary book grew with each page that I was reading.  It was difficult to put down.<br />A Past in Hiding has a lot to offer to the reader.  Roseman's research into the life and times of Marianne brought him together with her and her family members as recent as the late 1990s. He also interviewed numerous other \\"witnesses\\" of her life and survival during the Nazi period. It was fortuitous that so many family documents as well as official records survived.  Roseman studied diaries, correspondence and countless historical documents. His notes and the comprehensive bibliography reflect the thorough research that has gone into the book.  As a result, at some level A Past in Hiding reads like a detective story, fully absorbing and dramatic.  At another level, it is a very personal and critical account of Marianne and her contemporaries. At a third level, it is a study into the changed memory phenomenon, which can occur as a result of traumatic experiences. Last but not least, Rosemanintroduces the reader to the almost unknown movement of the \\"Bund\\" and their role in supporting victims of the Holocaust.  An extraordinary book that should have a place in the mind and heart of many people.troduces the reader to the almost unknown movement of the \\"Bund\\" and their role in supporting victims of the Holocaust.

Where does the creator of George Smiley, expert spy master of the cold war, go find a new theme?  Le Carre readers must have asked themselves this question.  Fortunately, after a couple of attempts in different directions,  Le Carre has found a new cause: Pharmaceutical companies and their dealings, in particular in Africa.  He tackles a highly sensitive and complex set of issues. As he says himself in the acknowledgements, in comparison to real life, his revelations are as 'tame as a picture postcard'.<br />We learn about the almost random testing of drugs on innocent Africans who believe that the men in white will cure them. We learn about the multi-national complexities of the pharma industry and the decision makers who are far removed from the African reality.  We follow the scientists who, having signed deals with the company,  were pressurized to either ignore or falsify the evidence of fatal side effects of the drug under investigation.  &quot;The drug is good&quot;, says one of the inventors of the drug, &quot; we just did not have enough time to test it out before releasing it.&quot;  The complete disregard for the lives of human guinea pigs who 'would die anyway' reveals an incredible cynicism of the promoter of the drug in Africa, who repeats 'I love Africa'. The comprehensive network of evidence cover-ups, disappearance of bodies and destruction of records, paints a bleak picture of the goings-on in a country like Kenya.  The deals made by the Foreign Service in London as well as Nairobi,  bring a touch of familiarity to the intrigue and the plot.  It is a novel, let's not forget it, although the reality of Kenya today is pretty realistically drawn with the corruption of the system, the readiness of the governments to strike deals with multinationals as well as the brutal police force, the &quot;Moi boys&quot;.  Le Carre is true to his reputation as an expert in character development.  With fine attention to detail, he creates a set of characters who are as much stereotypes of British Foreign and Secret Service operating in Africa as they are real and complex individuals.  The most intriguing character and the one who will attract most compassion from the reader, lives only through the descriptions, dialogues and daydreams of others.  She lived life fully until caught up in the drug scandal.  We know early on what happened to her, but Le Carre builds the events in a quest of discovery by her husband, the constant gardener.  He is changed in the process of the quest and brings the story to a logical conclusion.<br />In the current debate around GMO (genetically modified organism) research, the difficulties some scientists experience when publishing critical research results on pharmaceuticals, the newly rekindled interest in Africa by western politicians, THE CONSTANT GARDENER is a very topical book.  It is also captivating, and, despite the gravity of the issues, a good and intriguing story.are as much stereotypes of British Foreign and Secret Service operating in Africa as they are real and complex individuals.

It is easy to find books that claim biotechnology is the answer to the developing world's woes.  It's much  more difficult to find considered and well researched investigations from southern experts and scientists on the challenges the &quot;benefits&quot; of biotechnology are bringing to their cultures.<br />MONOCULTURES OF THE MIND is a collection of essays representing such a &quot;southern&quot; scientist's vital perspective. Shiva makes provocative contributions in the ever expanding debate around what (and who) will feed future generations of humans in the developing world.  She argues that a mono-agriculture society - where trees are seen as nothing more than timber and crop yield is the only measure for economic value of cereals - reflects a mental and political system that will lack in vision and complexity in general.  However, diverse knowledge systems are necessary to address the challenges ahead of us.  For example, in traditional societies, trees have multiple purposes, from food, water reservoir and shelter to nutrients of the soil around them. Timber value is only one (small) part of the whole. Traditional knowledge systems contribute in major ways to the understanding of biodiversity, ecological sustainability and cultural, including agri-cultural, diversity.<br />Vandana Shiva is a geneticist as well as an environmentalist and her expertise comes to the fore in her analysis of threats to biodiversity and the dramatic loss of species and varieties in modern times.  She also reviews various negative impacts posed by biotechnology on fragile southern ecosystems and the dangers to southern economies.<br />You don't have to agree with all of Vandana Shiva's views, BUT, you should read some of her books for what she has to say and what she represents.  MONOCULTURES is a good starting point.ad some of her books for what she has to say and what she represents.  MONOCULTURES is a good starting point.	2001-02-10

Although set in the future, starting somewhere aound 2010 and going well  beyond the next couple of centuries, the speculative fiction aspect of the  book is an intriguing but not the most important aspect. It is part  thriller, based around the disappearance of a soul-mate brother in the  polical unrest in Hongkong, part social critique of the situation of street  people and other outcasts in the near future. Finally, it is part romance  and exploration of time, relationships and art. The most fascinating layer  of this fully engrossing book is the evolving main character, a woman  photograher, who step by step learns to see in completely new ways thanks  to the growing influence over her by a blind paleontologist who sees with  his hands and feels the history of life in ammonite fossils.	2000-08-20
