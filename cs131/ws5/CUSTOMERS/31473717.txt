I wasn't disappointed-- you get John Waters' strange youth and the stories behind his early freak film experiments in the 1970s.  Some of my favorite quotes:<br /><br />\\"Parents should worry if their children haven't been arrested by the time they turn sixteen.  Being a juvenile delinquent is a birthright and as much a part of a healthy adolescence as smoking cigarettes or getting pimples.\\"<br /><br />\\"Whenever I hear a friend casually mention an interest in a sporting event, I immediately reconsider our friendship. . . .  All sports are contemptible.\\"<br /><br />I absolutely love how compleletely unconcerned young Waters was with societal expectations.  While most young boys worry about grades, sports, or the pretty girl, young Waters fetishized the street-fighting bad girls and ditched school to drop acid and watch trashy low-budget horror films.  And best of all, his alternative education seems to have worked out wonderfully for him, as he gathers an appreciative cult of like-minded freaks around him and takes the world of underground cinema by storm!	2005-08-29
US	31473717	R3UDI40US0ORAZ	0375705457	931553433	Camp Concentration: A Novel	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Sorcerers of Death's Construction	\\"Camp Concentration\\" reads as an early foray of what would later be called the \\"New Wave\\" of SF: literary and countercultural, in the vein of Dick, Delany and LeGuin.  Whereas \\"Golden Age\\" SF writers were in thrall to the \\"American Dream,\\" here we begin to see the darkness of the realities of power.<br /><br />Louis Saccheti (shades of Sacco-Vanzetti?) comes off as a rather bland and bloated fellow early in the novel, primarily concerned with the prison food he is being served as a conscientious objector to the massive nuclear war being waged by the U.S.  However, we then witness his transformation after the government injects him with a syphilis-derivative spirochete which multiplies his intelligence as it consumes his body within months (see the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment).<br /><br />As Sacchetis' intellect explodes, so does his vocabulary, sending me scrambling to look up several words per page in the unabridged dictionary.  Saccheti's intellect also manifests itself as the loss of his religious faith, sending him back to the atheism of his teens.  An interesting idea: perhaps the flights of hormonal teenage minds are closer to \\"genius\\" than the dulled edges of their elders'.<br /><br />The book is not perfect.  In the middle, we take a lenghty detour when some of the geniuses try to perfect the ancient magick of alchemy with the philosopher's egg, and the general in charge of the camp buys it all hook, line, and sinker.  I found it somewhat unbelievable (even though it is well-established that some of our past senile Commanders-in-Chief subscribed wholeheartedly to astrology).<br /><br />I found it interesting how the story of the camp concentrated much of human history, beginning with aspirations towards alchemical magick, and ending with a confrontation between an absolute, Naziesque scientific materialism and the poetic dreams of Saccheti.  Disch has managed to fit much of the human story into this slim allegorical volume.	2005-08-15

Even as a youngster he was a madman, stripping naked in front of billboards and leaping from apartment rooftops into swimming pools.  He even had sex with his dad's girlfriend and smoked herb when he was only 11 years old!  Even when he was a homeless junkie, lurking in parking garages to shoot up H, he had relations with unbelievably gorgeous girls.  How does he do it...?  The guy has mojo.<br /><br />I was more into the book at the beginning because I dug the youthful insanity.  After Blood Sugar Sex Magick came out and Anthony became a superstar, he's no longer striving, just buying million-dollar mansions, vast amounts of heroin and coke, and living like your typical rock star.  Anthony drugged solo in motel rooms, really more of a junkie than a partier, and there's also tons of rehab-speak that sounds like it was taken straight from the Big Book...  Not as fun.<br /><br />It's cool to read about the bandmates.  I always thought Flea was the insane bass genius, but he seems normal in this book, staying away from drugs and raising his daughter.  Frusciante is really interesting, since he is pretty much the key to the Chili Pepper's mainstream success-- everything he touches is golden-- and yet he was so conflicted about success.  An autobiography by Frusciante about this period would probably be a bit deeper and more interesting.<br /><br />And after all the madness, Anthony is still peaking as a rock star, with \\"Californication\\" and \\"Scar Tissue\\" still pumping from every radio.  He really has had a blessed life compared to the 9-to-5 pencil pushers, if only he stays away from the needle and the damage done.	2005-08-10

As a huge GTA: San Andreas fan and reader, part of me was intrigued by the idea, part of me saw it as a blatant ploy for the couch-potato South Park generation.<br /><br />I would recommend this book as an extremely breezy read for those curious about what's going on in brain science.  Johnson describes how our brains are always on endogenous drugs, be they the love potion oxytocin, the stressor cortisol, the confidence-building serotonin, etc.  He also recounts some pretty interesting experiments where his mind is connected to electrodes and fMRI machines and his mental processes monitored.  I have to admit, though, I wanted something a little meatier and substantive about the human mind, and wasn't quite sure if the book was limited by the state of brain science or Johnson's attempt to simplify for the everyman.  Most people are aware that the mind is a neurochemical network, so there isn't anything particularly revelatory here.<br /><br />Johnson rarely gets abstract.  He discusses the \\"qualia\\" of consciousness only to sidestep it.  (I found myself wondering why the metaphysical qualia of consciousness is even necessary; the illusion of a unified \\"I\\" must have some evolutionary advantages over a machine-like processor.)  At the end he tackles Freud, but I found his attempts somewhat simplistic against the godfather of psychoanalysis.<br /><br />In sum, while an interesting read, the book stretches out a little bit of information a long way.  A lot of this information could have been in one magazine article.  And I did fear that Johnson was trying to dumb it down a bit; I wouldn't mind more intensive scrutiny of the actual neurochemical components of the mind.	2005-08-05

I decided to finally check out this novel after a favorable blurb on the jacket of \\"The Corrections.\\"  If that book was the literary version of a crowd-pleaser, I feel that \\"White Noise\\" would please no crowds-- it's the hermetic cousin on the frigid mountaintop, left to his own abstract and intellectual pursuits.<br /><br />A reviewer called DeLillo's prose \\"cool and evocative;\\" I would say \\"cold and cerebral.\\"  The characters are genuinely passionless and speak in the language of cryptic philosophers.  The plot seems to exist only to tease-- the \\"toxic airborne event\\" appears halfway through, hinting at a thriller, before instantly disappearing as the book reverts to the everyday.  The book is completely \\"unconstrained\\" by any requirements of realism, and virtually every interaction is latently improbable.  How can a book be a true and powerful statement of our times if intrinsically unreal?<br /><br />All of this means that the novel is not compulsively readable, and is the epitome of big-L Literature.  At times, I feel that Literature is merely another genre, but with stringent lack of plot and constant attempts at poignance.<br /><br />That said, I found the book's thematic concerns interesting, especially how we are inundated with the \\"white noise\\"-- the babbling of the modern era, all concealing the latent fear of death.  The novel struck me as deeply Heideggerian-- Being-towards-Death is our true nature, and we live our lives constantly trying to shroud this plain fact.<br /><br />Perhaps I am approaching this novel wrong-- it is not actually a work of fiction, but of philosophy.	2005-07-29

His mother constantly hounds him to find gainful employment, leading him to bizarre misadventures as an office clerk and hot dog vendor.  How could this situation not be funny?<br /><br />Some reviewers talk about the latent sadness in this book.  It's hard to see, unless you empathize with Ignatius, or imagine that the author empathized with him.  I myself empathized with Ignatius-- perhaps a little too strongly-- as I read this book during a period of unemployment and have always had academic aspirations.  Some will easily discredit and dismiss Ignatius and his pen pal Myrna-- but isn't it somewhat sad that someone as astute and creative as Ignatius won't find a place in this world unless he fits into some kind of occupational niche?<br /><br />But hey, maybe I'm being a bit too heavy-- the book's damn funny.  My favorite scene: when Ignatius writes a fake letter, pretending to be his boss, threatening to \\"lash the pathetic shoulders\\" of an unsatisfied customer.  If only one could be so bold and brazen in the working world.	2005-07-29
US	31473717	R1LYHZTQJGCCZU	0312421273	647099960	The Corrections: A Novel	Books	5	10	12	N	N	Excellent Novel	\\"The Corrections\\" is the best novel I've read for some time.  The form is a sweeping family epic, switching perspectives among the various family members to provide an amazingly detailed and intricate tapestry, similar to Steinbeck or John Irving.  Each of the characters is intricately wrought, from the conformist-but-optimistic Enid, to the descending-into-madness Alfred, and their children: the liberal academic Chip, the mortgage broker Gary, and the coming-out chef Denise.  It's very, very difficult to write a sympathetic and completely accurate portrait of a character like Chip, well-versed in modern scholarship but at sea in so many other ways, and then switch over to an equally sympathetic and accurate portrait of Gary, the devoutly materialist mortgage broker mired in depression and locked in a power struggle with his wife.  The characters in this book are, simply, amazing.<br /><br />However, this book is more than the story of a family, as shown by the recurring sociopolitical themes.  At first, when Chip's critiques of late capitalism collapse so readily when challenged by a flaky student, I shivered at the thought that the book might devolve into some sort of Ayn Randish conservative polemic.  But if the book fully reveals the limits and inconsistencies of Chip's worldview, it does so equally for each of the other characters, including Enid and Gary.<br /><br />An excellent, excellent book.  I don't understand the negative reviews: perhaps those who quake in terror when they encounter a word they don't understand, and stick to Grishamesque plotboilers.  Or perhaps they worship that modern media goddess who rejected Franzen when he didn't prostrate himself sufficiently to kiss her ring.	2005-07-18

I might have stayed away because of the femme cover/title, and the inside art is all over the place quality-wise.<br /><br />I'm wishing that I had picked it up sooner, though, because the storylines here are among the best in the series, and maybe in comicdom.  One story I loved: yuppies at a pharmaceutical company distribute a crack that kills the bodies of users and leaves them as empty vessels for the yuppies to \\"joy ride.\\"  Another: the back story of Lord Fanny and her psychosexual \\"spirit quest\\" to become a transsexual witch.<br /><br />For those who haven't been exposed to The Invisibles, you need to check this series out.  I find it more twisted, more compelling, and more fringe than any of the other series I've read, including Transmetropolitan and Preacher.  In fact, this is light-years beyond anything published in drab-text \\"Literature.\\"	2005-06-20

Compare the terse, stripped-down language of \\"Gun, With Occasional Music\\" with his hyperverbose description in \\"Fortress of Solitude.\\"  The man is a literary chameleon, a ventroliquist of strange new voices.<br /><br />Of what I've read so far, my favorite two Lethem stories are \\"Mood Bender\\" from The Best of Crank! anthology and \\"The Happy Man\\" from this one.  Like what other reviewers have said, the rest is a mixed bag.  Most are interesting, and might show the beginnings of Lethem's literary aspirations, as they are more vignettes than traditional stories (\\"Light and the Sufferer,\\" about crackheads shadowed by strange mute aliens, is the best of these).  Frequently, I found myself impressed by the ideas far more than the stories themselves.<br /><br />But the collection is definitely worth reading, especially for fans of Philip K. Dick looking for something new in SF.  I enjoyed them much more than his more recent novels, where he takes a nose-dive into big-L \\"Literature,\\" with its endless description and dearth of plot.	2005-06-20

Whether this is true or not is never made clear.  Hoppy Harrington, an overeager, limbless young man, would seem to be a sympathetic figure in traditional SF, but is actually a power-mad misanthrope whose dreams are fulfilled by the holocaust.  He eventually tries to snuff out Walt Dangerfield, the somewhat cheesy radio announcer who circles the earth endlessly in his satellite after his mission to Mars was thwarted by the apocalypse.  Dangerfield's radio program is the sole source of media interconnecting the post-holocaust society; he is beloved by the survivors, who listen to him addictively.  And along the way, we are shown a uniquely phildickian world, where even the animals are mutating into sentience and people need to design robotic animal trappers to chase and subdue them.  (If you like these ideas check out Jonathan Lethem's \\"Gun, with Occasional Music.\\")<br /><br />The only problem with this book is the same problem with all of Dick's books-- the prose is kind of clunky and the world is never sufficiently described, at least to my tastes.  Several modern SF authors present more compelling and emotionally resonant glimpses of the apocalypse, such as Womack's \\"Random Acts of Senseless Violence\\" and Octavia Butler's \\"Parable of the Sower.\\"	2005-04-22

The \\"President\\" is an android figurehead who regurgitates what its masters want, and the true battle is which cartel will produce the \\"President\\" (shades of Dubya).  The First Lady is an eternally youthful woman replaced every generation with a new actress-- shades of the smiling empty-vessel First Ladies we've come to expect (demand?) and the sniffling over pretty strangers like Princess Di.  Better than any other SF writer, Dick shows how we live in a bubble of media myth manufactured by those who hold the reins.  While the goverment presents this perfect facade, it is secretly arranging \\"talks\\" with Goebbels through time travel, apparently to negotiate an end to the past Nazi menace, unbenownst to the benighted masses.  Typical.<br /><br />There are plenty of other great Dick ideas in this novel, such as the fact that the pharmaceutical cartels have arranged for psychotherapy to be outlawed.  No more talking cure, just jack up the serotonin.  How could Dick see our future present, when even M.D.s are prescribing Prozac merely to increase somatic energy levels?  He also shows a world where people pay outlandish prices to be a member of a particular \\"community,\\" and how these communities become xenophobic about outsiders and strive to rise above them-- yet another insight into the mind of the human animal, so eager to rally around any totem.<br /><br />There can be no doubt about it: Dick was a genius.  This is one of his better works in my book, up there with Martian Time-Slip, before he became overly abstract and theological (see Valis and especially his Exegesis).	2005-04-14

You can also tell that Houellebecq is wounded, that we are all wounded in his eyes.. and aren't we?  When you strip away all of the comforting illusions, the religious nonsense and the self-help books?  How could you NOT be wounded in this dead world of capitalist mechanized machinations, soulless suburbia, Jesus freaks on the media creep?<br /><br />I picked up this book on the cheap, and I would never expect it to be a hit in America.. This country is too consumed with its own childlike capitalist chest-thumping, popping Prozac and \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" as it ignores the rest of the world, content to have its quasi-retarded leaders bomb it into submission.  Just mainline Jesus, freaks, on your drive through the McDonalds/Motel 6 wasteland, and forget about all this bad nonsense-- Escape via medicinal and/or theological means, and go easy into that eternal oblivion nipping at your heels.<br /><br />But if you are one of the few homo sapiens with a useful brain, and enjoy dark existential visions (I'm thinking Solondz films, esp. \\"Happiness,\\" \\"Vernon God Little,\\" Hunter Thompson, etc.), then you MUST buy this book.	2005-03-28

Read it closely-- this is what happens when the religious right wins.  I am amazed that Atwood was able to see our future so clearly when she wrote this book in the early 1980s.<br /><br />In \\"The Handmaid's Tale,\\" the Bible Thumpers have overtaken our government, demolished the church-state barrier, and installed their own vile brand of theocratic fascism in the Republic of Gilead.  (Take note: they rise to power by citing a constant threat of unnamed terrorists, necessitating police state measures.)<br /><br />In Gilead, everyone is segregated into a strict caste hierarchy.  Men may be the Commanders, who are in charge, the Eyes, who are the agents of the Panopticon who whisk away any deviants, the Angels who wage the faraway wars, etc.  Women's options are more strictly delimited: they may be the Wives of the Commanders, Econowives of the lower ranks, the Aunts who dominate and control women of the lower ranks, the Marthas who do menial household chores, the prostitute Jezebels, and the Maids like the narrator Offred.<br /><br />As a Maid, Offred's sole purpose in life is to breed with her Commander.  The manner in which Commander Fred attempts to \\"fertilize\\" Offred simply must be read to be believed.  Interestingly, the Gileadans cite Biblical precedent to support this bizarre method of surrogate conception.  Maids are terminated if they prove unable to conceive.<br /><br />Since Offred's life options are so severely restricted, most of the novel takes place in her head.  She reminisces about the time before, when she was able to marry, own property, and have her own children, the gradual increase in restrictions, and her failed attempt at escape.  The novel is crushing in its illustration of a life thwarted, stunted, and defeated, and a woman made into an empty childbearing vessel.  Reading the book, I was reminded of prison memoirs-- Offred has no chance of an external life, and is trapped in a life of solitude and regret.<br /><br />Some people might say that such a future is unthinkable in our democratic society.  I would recommend that you speak to any member of the extreme evangelical ministries, which view Jefferson's separation of church and state as a lie and an illusion to be abolished, and believe in the literal, inerrant truth of the Bible.  I would also recommend that you read V.S. Naipaul's \\"Among the Believers,\\" concerning the Islamic revolutions in Iran and Pakistan.  Gilead's corporal punishments for heresy, dismantling of all democratic institutions like the press, and mandatory \\"Prayvaganzas\\" closely track what happened in Iran after the Ayatollahs overthrew the Shah.<br /><br />I would place this excellent book on par with \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World.\\"  \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" is necessary reading in this day and age.pped in a life of solitude and regret. <br /> <br />Some people might say that such a future is unthinkable in our democratic society.

The cowriter is Neil Strauss, who also co-wrote the Motley Crue book \\"The Dirt.\\"  Both books are packed with all the juicy sex, drugs, and rock n' roll, without being watered down by TV decency standards.<br /><br />The only reason I give the book 4 stars instead of 5 is because it hits a wall around page 200.  Up until then, it's a racing story of Jenna's descent into addiction and entrance into porn.  But at page 200, we get WAY too much information about her sad childhood with a distant, endlessly name-dropping single father.  Zzzz.  (Isn't it also kind of kinky to have sultry nude pics of Jenna interspersed with her childhood photos throughout the book??)<br /><br />Up until that point though, the book rocks.  I have wondered what makes a woman go into porn, and always assumed that it came about from putting money over relationships, much like prostitutes.  (See \\"Brothel\\" by Alexa Albert for a behind-the-scenes look.)  But this book presents Jenna as not only a calculating sex diva, but also a real person who had to struggle with a background of drugs and biker gangs.  Howard Stern always assumes that porn stars were sexually abused as children, and when young Jenna is raped by a biker overlord named Preacher, you go \\"Hmmm.\\"<br /><br />That said, I'm not so sure that this book really is a \\"cautionary tale.\\"  Jenna had tough times, but look at her now-- a multimillionaire in a seemingly stable marriage with her (admittedly very effeminate) husband Jay.  Whether or not it was \\"worth it\\" depends on your own moral calculus, but there's no denying that it looks like a hell of a ride!	2004-12-13

Larry is at his best pointing out the deranged hypocrisy of the right-wing Bible Thumpers, who spout mythological platitudes to advance an anti-poor, anti-minority, anti-privacy agenda.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to those impressed by the always individualistic and libertarian Larry Flynt.

In straightforward, no-nonsense language, he documents exactly how the radical conservatives (\\"Radcons\\") have hijacked and perverted the language of public morality, prosperity, and patriotism.<br /><br />First, Reich discusses how the Radcons have intruded into the private realms of people's bedrooms, trying to decree what is and is not acceptable sexual morality for others.  The Radcons argue that the poor need \\"guardrails\\" in order to keep them in line.  Reich turns this reasoning on its head: sexuality is not the realm of government, but corporate malfeasance certainly is.  Reich wonders why moralists so concerned with private sex acts completely ignore the rampant looting taking place in the upper socioeconomic echelons.  Reich argues that conflicts of interest a la Enron and Arthur Andersen are not rare exceptions, but are the way the game is played.  Where are the \\"guardrails\\" for those at the top?!<br /><br />Next, Reich disputes the Radcon interpretation of \\"prosperity.\\"  Radcons worship the free market and subscribe to simplistic tenets like \\"a rising tide lifts all boats.\\"  Reich uses statistics to prove that this is conclusively untrue: the richest percentiles have grown astronomically more wealthy in recent decades, the middle has risen little if at all, and the ranks of the poor have increased.  The \\"free market\\" is not something deserving of slavish worship for its own sake; too often, it is used to argue for vast tax cuts for the wealthy that help no one else.  Reich argues that this money could be spent in better ways, such as education and health care programs that actually benefit the non-wealthy.<br /><br />Finally, Reich tackles the \\"negative patriotism\\" of the right.  The O'Reillys of the right label everyone who questions this Administration and its decision to go to war as traitors and terrorists.  In calm and reasoned language, Reich points out that dissent is one of our most cherished rights under the First Amendment, and indeed is what separates us from more fascistic regimes.  In the words of Teddy Roosevelt, \\"To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.\\"  America is made of sterner stuff than the right-wingers think, and petty resorts to McCarthyesque suppression only destroys that which we are trying to protect.<br /><br />In sum, Reich deconstructs the high-flown rhetoric of the Radcons in only 200 pages of clear, well-reasoned argument.  It would be great if conservatives read this book to see if it affects their ideologies, but I doubt that they would.  In conclusion, Reich urges progressives to gather together and organize to resist the tide of Radcon unreason.  I can only hope that others heed his clarion call.ished rights under the First Amendment, and indeed is what separates us from more fascistic regimes.

His writing is always witty and urbane, but also packs a political punch.  Thankfully, he doesn't delve into the depths like many political writers at the moment.  Instead, he relies on the facts and his wit to make his points, and respects the intelligence of his readers.  If you are not familiar with his work, I urge you to pick up a recent issue of \\"The New Yorker\\" and read his pieces in \\"The Talk of the Town\\" section.<br /><br />This book is an impressive archive of Hertzberg's writing over the past 40 years.  Most of the book consists of his writing in the 1980s for \\"The New Republic\\" and his more recent pieces for \\"The New Yorker.\\"  While his writing has always been impressive, I found that it become more cogent, direct and \\"punchy\\" as time went on.  His articles are organized into a variety of sections, from \\"Enough About the Sixties\\" (the hippies and classic rock), \\"Great Men,\\" (articles on Carter, Reagan, and RFK), to \\"Judeo-Christians,\\" \\"Wingers,\\" \\"Wedge Issues,\\" and \\"The Wayward Media.\\"<br /><br />I found \\"The Ghost in the Machine\\" section on proportional representation especially interesting.  Not only would such a system do away with pointless anachronisms like the electoral college, but it would obviously be more democratic and representative.  Unfortunately, we will most likely never see such a system because it is too threatening to the Powers That Be-- namely, the two major political parties.  Sadly, we are much more likely to see a constitutional amendment so that a specific Viennese weightlifter can be President.<br /><br />This book is a treasure trove of wit and wisdom, and I learned a great deal about recent political history reading it.  I urge you to add this invaluable resource to your library.	2004-09-22

Hell, if the F.B.I. kept a file on Ernest Hemingway, they certainly have one on Nicholson Baker after this brave book.<br /><br />The novel is written as a transcript of a taped conversation between two friends, Ben and Jay.  The book's a quick read at just a little over 100 pages and can be devoured in a few hours.  The intense conversation captures Jay's rage at Bush and his bloody crusades in Iraq, and while Ben empathizes, he is the voice of reason trying to keep Jay under control.  Jay rails about the mutilated Iraqi children, Bush and friends' shameless self-enrichment while others suffer, etc.  Ben, who appears to be more interested in history than the present, tries to get Jay interested in photography, and tells him that he has to concentrate on the beautiful trees, not the metaphorical gnats swarming around him.<br /><br />If you're at the library or bookstore, do yourself a favor and breeze through this book.  Anyone should be able to feel an echo or twinge of Jay's rage when he depicts the gross aggression and hypocrisy of this Administration.  While the reader probably won't agree with the entirety of what Jay says, the dialogue is powerful and affecting.<br /><br />This book will be even more grimly relevant if Dubya manages somehow to win the upcoming election.  The neocons are itching for more war and the silver-spoon simian is happy to appease them.  We are a few small steps from reinstatement of the draft and other morbid reminders of Vietnam.  If this happens, I am sure the streets will be filled with Jays.	2004-09-21

He explicitly shows the religious torture of the Inquisition, witch-burning, Native American genocide, etc., and brings us to the modern-day medieval zealotry of Muslim suicide bombers, attempts to stamp out necessary scientific research, etc.  His book is a clarion call to resist the tide of religious fervor, be it a literalist belief in holy mythology or more moderate forms of acceptance.<br /><br />I came upon this book in a Salon.com review, where the reviewer criticizes Harris for attributing the horrors of religion to religion itself.  Of course, while there may be other motivating factors in acts of atrocity, the factor of heartfelt conviction and belief in the words of an ancient holy book commanding you to annihilate the \\"infidels\\" should not be so easily discounted.<br /><br />However, by chapter four, I found myself wondering who this Harris character is.  He actually points to the Middle East's faith in Islam as an argument for our expansionist policies in the Middle East, and pathetically attempts to debunk Chomsky's foreign policy analysis with some of the most inane and insipid arguments I have ever read.  In a few pages, Harris \\"argues\\" that weapons are not perfect, so we should be resigned to \\"collateral damage\\" (a la Timothy McVeigh), as \\"intent\\" is all that matters.  Bush supposedly has \\"good\\" intent, whereas the terrorists' are supposedly \\"bad,\\" and that's all that matters, consequences be damned.  Harris should talk to his mentor Dershowitz-- full knowledge of the consequence of one's actions may be a species of intent and may be a sufficient finding for \\"depraved heart\\" murder.  \\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\\"  When Harris argues in favor of torture, I had the feeling that I was reading one of the Justice Department's memos of mangled legal reasoning by some punk who had spent too much time in philosophy seminars.<br /><br />Harris gets even more nutty after that, and by the final chapter, where he argues that Buddhism is somehow a more rational and scientific practice of self-scrutiny than any other religion, I was just shaking my head.  Really!  Buddhism may have merits that other religions lack, but Harris certainly does not explore these reasons with any proficiency beyond stating that Buddhism is concerned with \\"getting beyond the ego.\\"  Why is \\"ego-annihilation\\" a positive practice, moreso than, say, building up your ego?  Harris does not say to any degree of satisfaction, and it is obvious that he relies on his own \\"faith\\" when making such specious arguments.<br /><br />In sum, this book has some interesting kernels in it, but at the end I simply feel betrayed.  Don't take us on a journey, promising to eviscerate the absurdities of modern mythologies, and then end up arguing \\"Foreign Policy for Idiots\\" and the merits of your own particular brand of mythology.  Harris' idea that his own cockamamie opinions are somehow more \\"rational\\" is, in the end, laughable.

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	5	20	26	N	N	An Insightful Look at Modern Conservatism	This book is required reading for those who wonder how the Republican Party, which represents the interests of the wealthiest elite, has risen to dominance among the blue-collar lower-income employees in the red states.  Traditionally, it has been common knowledge that the GOP helps the wealthiest with tax cuts and deregulation, while employees lose any protections they might otherwise receive through those regulations.  Why then have these lower-income employees turned to the GOP?<br /><br />Frank provides an insightful and compelling analysis.  He shows that the \\"culture war,\\" a.k.a. the \\"backlash,\\" has been an effective tool to bring these lower-income whites into the GOP.  The right-wing pundits bemoan the control of the \\"liberal elite\\" and the \\"liberal media,\\" and emphasize wedge issues like abortion, school prayer, and indecency in the media.  (Of course, these paranoiac fantasies of control by a \\"liberal elite\\" are as fantastic as conspiracies of the Mason, the Illuminati, or the Elders of Zion.)  The right-wingers thus bring their dittoheads to a boil, all the while doing absolutely nothing on these issues.  Abortion and school prayer can be altered only by the Supreme Court, not Kansas regional politics.  And when it comes to indecency, Republican deregulation only helps the \\"race to the bottom\\" we see.  Thus the GOP has hit on the perfectly intangible issues: ones that will never be solved, but that will only be amped up to the GOP's assured benefit.  Of course, for all of their moral posturing, the Republicans that the Kansans send to the legislatures quickly buddy up to corporate backers and launch a campaign of tax cuts and deregulation for their benefactors, which can do nothing but hurt lower-income Kansans.<br /><br />Frank depicts a truly a sad state of affairs.  One wonders how this repulsive hybrid of laissez-faire economics and Christian fundamentalism can ever be resolved.  In the end, I hope only that their idiocy can be contained, and will not spill over into my life or the lives of my loved ones.  Perhaps these Kansans richly deserve what they get-- the transformation of their state into one of stridently Christian, anti-science, impoverished labor.not spill over into my life or the lives of my loved ones.

There are those who wish to emphasize the mind as purely matter, an intricate neurochemical network (reflected in this book by Kandel's work on the minds of sea slugs). Slater is not in this camp-- she invests psychology with a more emotional and human perspective, which of course veers closer to literature and the humanities. As Slater notes, this inherent tension in psychology has existed since Freud.<br /><br /> That said, the book is a fascinating recounting of the most revolutionary psychological experiments in the past century. I took few psychology classes in college, but the only things I took away were the &quot;rats on cocaine&quot; experiments, endlessly pushing a lever to trigger &quot;fixes&quot; while they starved to death. As a layman reader, this book truly fleshed out my understanding of the dramatic experiments of the past, and also brought me up to speed on some of the present controversies in the field.<br /><br /> While Skinner's behaviorist studies and Milgram's obedience experiment have been around for a long time, many people (like my wife) refuse to accept their disturbing central findings. The experiments show that the psychological is always political/philosophical, and reflect the tension between free will v. social construction. Slater doesn't try to artifically structure the history of psychology for consistency, but actively courts these tensions.<br /><br /> For example, Slater covers recent studies that are extremely controversial. The &quot;Rat Park&quot; experiment challenges the &quot;rats on cocaine&quot; experiments and the inevitability of physical addiction-- this can't help but be controversial, as it challenges the central tenets of many recovery programs. Loftus' experiments also challenge the notion of adulthood recovery of repressed childhood memories, which I'm sure would infuriate most survivors of abuse.<br /><br /> Slater is passionate in courting these controversies and pushing buttons, but this all helps to create a living, breathing history of psychology and its players. The controversies are still there, even for the older &quot;classic&quot; experiments of Milgram et al., and I personally would rather have these controversies explored than ignored or supressed. (For those of a more scientist (reductionist?) bent, I would recommend &quot;The Blank Slate&quot; by Pinker.)abuse. <br />  <br /> Slater is passionate in courting these controversies and pushing buttons, but this all helps to create a living, breathing history of psychology and its players.

(Of course, if you are right-wing enough, everything appears to be to the left.)<br />Conason also shows how &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; as a doctrine was developed by religious right characters who want to enforce archaic &quot;biblical law&quot; in this country.  (Scary stuff!)  In addition, Conason gives plenty of details on the Bush family's &quot;crony capitalism&quot;-- i.e., using their government connections to enrich themselves and others (see Halliburton)-- while espousing &quot;free market&quot; theories and deriding government intervention.  Talk about hypocrisy!!<br />Regardless of your political position, this book is a catalog of carefully detailed FACTS that will help you understand what is really going on.  Right-wingers, who value self-enriching tax cuts and/or Christian fundamentalism above all else, would probably shrug at these facts.  Those same right-wingers have devised a well-funded &quot;echo chamber&quot; to spread illusory memes like &quot;liberal media&quot; or &quot;compassionate conservatism.&quot;  If you want to dig beneath the echo chamber and see the man behind the curtain, I highly recommend this book.  (I also highly recommend Franken's &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars,&quot; which contains a lot of the same information but is presented more amusingly.)	2004-06-21

For anyone who has pondered how it all started, how it will all end, or such ideas as whether the universe has a boundary, this book offers a fascinating discussion of our current understanding of these matters.<br />Hawking first explores how our view of the universe has changed since ancient times, then explains the revolutionary theories of relativity and quantum mechanics.  Einstein developed the idea that space-time is &quot;curved&quot; and exists in four dimensions with his theory of relativity.  Quantum mechanics was especially interesting-- the idea that matter can be viewed as either a wave or a particle, that matter and forces consist of the same particles with different &quot;spin,&quot; or that all forces might be different incarnations of the same absolute force, was especially interesting.<br />Hawking also explores the most cutting-edge issues in astrophysics.  He shows how the universe can be considered like the earth, with time beginning at the North Pole and ending at the &quot;big crunch&quot; at the South Pole.  The question of &quot;what happened before the big bang&quot; thus becomes immaterial, as space-time was infinitely curved and &quot;time&quot; as we know it did not exist.  He also suggests that space-time may be curved and therefore &quot;finite without a boundary,&quot; a fascinating idea that I found difficult to visualize.  Hawking asks what role a Creator might have if the universe is a &quot;closed system&quot; like this.<br />This book packs an enormous amount of information into few pages, but it is not as difficult a read as your average physics textbook.  I highly recommend it to anyone concerned with the eternal issues confronting humankind.	2004-06-14

Several of these vignettes are genuinely, laugh-out-loud funny.<br />Beyond this &quot;culture clash&quot; humor, the book makes no deep statements on the interrelationship of Eastern and Western cultures.  Perhaps her criticisms were more relevant when a glut of hippies saturated India in the 60s and 70s, but the glut has dried up.

I picked this book up at an airport in India, and I have to say it's the best book I've read in years.. and I read a lot!  The narrator, Vernon &quot;God&quot; Little, is the most genuine and sympathetic character I've ever encountered in fiction.  I was completely caught up in his struggle, and I really, really wanted him to have a happy ending.<br />Be warned: The comedy is black, and fully explores the sordid underbelly of modern American life.  The women are all obese and fixated on the latest diet fads.  The media are a pack of jackals, and actively worsen the tragedy for their own profit.  The criminal justice system is an absurd sort of game show with someone's life hanging in the balance.  Perhaps these are exaggerations, but isn't that the purpose of satire?  At any rate, any trip through Texas or flip through cable TV channels will show that the novel isn't as exaggerated as we might like to think.<br />The book features stellar writing and a fine tweaking of American sensibilities.  I can't recommend this outstanding book highly enough, especially those who enjoy black satires (i.e., &quot;Happiness&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Dollhouse,&quot; Ellis' &quot;American Psycho,&quot; or Hunter S.

Pinker is undeniably brilliant, and his explorations of the debate are thought-provoking and stimulating.  Pinker sets out to debunk three popular notions: the Blank Slate (that people are born blank and their identities are forged by their environment), the Noble Savage (people are born inherently good and are corrupted by society), and the Ghost in the Machine (that some metaphysical soul directs individuals).  Pinker capably challenges all three, but levels most of his attacks against the first two traditionally liberal doctrines rather than the latter conservative one.<br />Which brings me to a problem with this book: Pinker mentions actual studies involving brain damage and twin similarities, but his arguments extend well beyond those supported purely in empirical evidence.  Pinker delves into politics, gender, and the humanities, all the while claiming that his somewhat conservative-skewed slant is supported by hard science.<br />Pinker's claim that all of his views on these matters are supported by science is dubious.  For example, at one point he attacks liberal scholars who suggest that modern man has difficulty seeing through the bombardment of media images he is exposed to.  Instead, Pinker claims such fears are misplaced because man is endowed with an innate common sense.  However, man's mental capacities evolved in a far different environment than today's media, and it's difficult to see how Pinker refutes the ideas of the liberal scholars.<br />Pinker repeatedly levels vitriolic attacks against these &quot;liberal&quot; scholars, especially those in sociology who emphasize the importance of culture.  As an inatist psychologist would, he argues that men are individuals first and members of society second, and that society and culture are formed by individual men. True in the abstract, but difficult to reconcile with the fact that we are born into a world with a preexisting culture and society.  One who attempts to exercise control over the culture they are born into will find their influence extremely limited.<br />This book is an insightful exploration of modern biological and philosophical issues on what it means to be human.

It follows in the vein of the earlier existentialists Camus and Sartre, but rather than featuring alienated individualist narrators, the book brings existentialist themes into the world of politics and human relationships.<br />Kundera raises the question: If life is lived only once, never to be repeated, how can we know that our course is right, rather than randomly determined?  We can never compare our course with alternatives or rewrite history.  Therefore, life becomes a light and insubstantial thing: hence the \\"unbearable lightness of being.\\"<br />The book concerns Tomas, a successful doctor who is eventually forced into become a truck driver under the Communist Czech regime, and Teresa, who suffers as a result of Tomas' infidelities and has morbid dreams of death.  Their love seems to arise from a series of random coincidences, yet leads to a lifelong romance.  During the course of that romance, Tomas sacrifices his medical practice to return with Teresa to oppressive Czechoslovakia, but has difficulty sacrificing his womanizing.<br />The book also charts the relationship of Sabrina and Franz, which exhibits the miscommunication between people even when they're speaking the same language.  The list of misunderstood terms between the two, with each's very different connotations, shows the limits on language's ability to create a shared world.  This dictionary of difference was one of my favorite parts of the book.<br />I also enjoyed the part where Franz becomes a political \\"agitator\\" in Cambodia.  The section was especially biting and satirical in showing the inefficacy of such toothless agitation, and also in showing that agitation in the name of ideology is not always driven by the abstract ideology itself.  In Franz' case, he is motivated by his fetishized image of his lost Sabrina.<br />All in all, the novel features an interesting interplay between story and philosophy.hy.	2004-03-26

Turow develops the world of Kindle County far beyond that seen in &quot;Presumed Innocent.&quot;  And Turow doesn't sacrifice plot development for the sake of these characterizations, as he tended to do in &quot;The Laws of our Fathers.&quot;<br />Turow's development of his characters is simply masterful.  In more Grishamesque works, the characters all seem to think in the same manner, and the book is driven only by twists and turns of the plot.  Here, the characters are all clearly different people, and their internal dialogues reflect that.  We know that we're in former judge and junkie Gillian Sullivan's head because of her negativistic doomsday thinking, and that we're in Arthur Raven's head because of his romantic heart and idealism.<br />Not that Turow is a slouch when it comes to plot, which concerns a gruesome triple murder in a restaurant in 1991.  The book flashes between the investigation of the crime and 2001, when Rommy Gandolph obtains Arthur Raven as his attorney for a federal habeas petition.  The assumption that Rommy Gandolph committed the crime, which seemed obvious in 1991 due to his &quot;confession,&quot; becomes increasingly unraveled as the novel continues.  We see that the law is an imperfect mechanism and that things that seem obvious are not always so, but that sometimes the law can work if those in the system possess a certain amount of idealism and play fair.<br />All in all, this is Turow at the top of his game, and highly recommended reading.	2004-01-26

If you think that can be realized in a book, perhaps you should read something else-- maybe one of the self-help books arcing through the bestseller lists before it disappears into oblivion.  Siddhartha is a seeker, and probably only seekers-- those who have not adopted wholeheartedly a certain doctrine or dogma-- will appreciate this book.<br />Since Siddhartha is a seeker, he makes many &quot;mistakes,&quot; but those mistakes are necessary for his individual enlightenment.  At first, he is obsessed with spiritual fulfillment, leading him to leave his comfortable Brahmin life and become an ascetic Samana.  He meets Gotama the Illustrious One and is aware of the Buddha's enlightenment, but realizes that enlightenment cannot &quot;rub off&quot; on him from the Buddha.  At that point, he realizes that he should not smother his Self, but should appreciate his Self and the struggles of external reality (Samsara).<br />Eventually, Siddhartha becomes disgusted with the wine, women, and song of Samsara, and considers suicide, when he begins to approach true enlightenment.  Some have called this the &quot;leap of faith,&quot; others &quot;hitting bottom.&quot;  In any case, only by hitting the depths of despair does Siddhartha attain true enlightenment.<br />I wholly recommend this book to those interested in spiritual themes and greater truths, but are not ideologically &quot;stuck.&quot;  Siddhartha suggests a great truth: that while Samsara might not lead to true happiness, one does not appreciate Samsara and Nirvana until one has experienced both.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful little book that will start the mind thinking of greater truths lying beyond our day-to-day lives.  If you are perfectly satisfied with your day-to-day existence or have a certain ideological worldview that neatly explains higher truths, you will not appeciate this book on the same level.thinking of greater truths lying beyond our day-to-day lives.

Even so, his columns reveal his increasing disgust and bewilderment at Dubya's plan to give handouts to the already obscenely wealthy and eviscerate federal programs.<br />Krugman is at his best lambasting Dubya.  Krugman shows how Dubya took part in Enron-like schemes at Harken Energy, and intends to gut the S.E.C., so Dubya's lip service about increased corporate governance holds little weight.  Krugman details Dubya's repeated broken promises, including promises for aid to New York City, and we see that Dubya seems incapable of carrying out his word.<br />Of course, Dubya is primarily a tool of the radical right.  Krugman shows how the right will settle for nothing less than the dismantling of the federal government and its programs (except for a constant state of war, of course), akin to Henry Kissinger's paper on &quot;revolutionary powers.&quot;  Nobody likes paying taxes, but Krugman shows how deeply stupid and impractical such an agenda is: are we going to gut all government services, like the FDNY?  9/11 would have been much, much worse if the right had its way.  That's what the conservatives who argue against public airport security want-- they think that corporation do everything better, even though the sole purpose of every for-profit corporation is the bottom line, not security, safety, education, etc.  Do you really want security run like McDonald's?<br />Basically, Krugman explores how moronic it is to believe that gutting the federal government will make life better for the average person.  Does your kid want to go to college?  Sorry, your A kid won't qualify for federal aid-- only rich kids like C-student Dubya will attend the Ivy League.  The rich are getting richer, and the poor poorer, and Dubya is helping to exacerbate the economic divide.  But even talk of rich and poor, while obvious to the most casual observer, will set off the right about how liberals want &quot;class warfare.&quot; One conservative I know put forward the idiotic argument that Dubya was being &quot;persecuted&quot; for being the son of a President-- if &quot;persecution&quot; means attaining the office of President solely through birthright, persecute me!<br />There is much more to this book, and I urgently recommend you read it, especially before the 2004 election.

The short stories are all vignettes out of the lives of the addicted and the desperate.<br />What this book does, better than any other book I've read, is capture the beauty and tragedy of these lost lives.  Johnson is great at imagery, whether the misty, sunlit dive bar on a rickety pier, or the deserted drive-in in the snow.  He's also great at writing from the inside of these characters-- their tragic worldview makes sense through their eyes.  The hallucinatory beauty of these &quot;prose-poems&quot; goes hand-in-hand with the altered perceptions of the characters-- these people live as if in a dream state.<br />If you're ready to write off people on the fringes of society, then you probably won't appreciate this book.  Like he did in &quot;Angels,&quot; Johnson takes these forgotten people, and makes them live and breathe on the page.  Many times, his characters seem more truly alive than those who would write them off or forget about them.	2003-12-08

I've read &quot;Cryptonomicon,&quot; &quot;Snow Crash,&quot; and &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; by Stephenson.  All were fun, stimulating reads, with healthy doses of action and ideas, as well as vivid, fascinating portrayals of the present and near-future.<br />Be warned-- NOT SO HERE!  I got to page 200 of this verbose tome before giving up.  The main reason for this is that the ideas, which are usually the cornerstone in Stephenson's works, are sparse, not fleshed out, and anachronistic.  Rather than revelling in cutting-edge near-future ideas like virtual reality, cryptography, and memes, Stephenson is rewinding to hundreds of years ago, when most people's understanding of science was next to nil.<br />That would be okay, but the beginning of the book is primarily concerned with the Royal Society and Isaac Newton's first scientific experiments.  In hindsight, the experiments seem deeply retarded, cruel, and almost evil (see the parts where they dismember dogs and try to get a severed head to speak).  And there's no insight or analysis of just how horrific these experiments are.<br />Stephenson is the master of &quot;geek chic&quot; and when he lets his imagination free, it roars.  Here, we just have the geeks stuck in the ancient times of yore, conducting deeply stupid experiments.  Not stupid for their time, of course, and yet I really don't love science enough to spark the slightest flicker of interest in their blind gropings.<br />If you want a gripping, historical read, check out Clavell's Shogun.  This book tries to do the same thing, and fails... miserably.	2003-11-05

The movie was most enjoyable for its vision of a gritty dystopic future and its action sequences.<br />The book, like other works by PKD, is about ideas.  There is little &quot;action&quot;-- the android killings are basically executions.  PKD was never a &quot;prose stylist&quot; like Gibson, who could make a scene live and breathe.  Rather, he's concerned with the &quot;big issues&quot;-- primarily, the meaning of human existence.<br />The book is more challenging than the movie.  In the movie, the androids just seem like slightly stiff people-- people who had the misfortune of being created rather than born.  While they commit evil acts in the film, the ending clearly wants us to empathize with the androids.<br />In the book, the androids completely lack any empathy with any other creatures.  They care little when other creatures are killed, and seem to even lack a survival instinct.  That is why the Voight-Kampff test is used to test for androids-- it measures emotional reactions to the death of other living beings, which androids lack.  (This wasn't explained at all in the movie!)<br />What I found very interesting is that the Voight-Kampff test measures involuntary emotional reactions to the deaths of animals, which is taboo in this future world.  (The radioactive dust has killed of many species, making them a rare and precious commodity.)  Clearly, this can't be an intrinsic empathy that humans have-- we kill animals now!  Is this &quot;empathy&quot; something we get from the society we live in?<br />The book also dwells far more on the &quot;value&quot; that animals have in this future world.  The animals are supposed to be precious because many have been killed off by the war and the radioactive dust that lingers afterward.  The Mercer religion in the book puts primary value on other living things.  But how does this empathic &quot;value&quot; compare with the great monetary value of the animals?  Rick Deckard constantly pulls out his Sidney's to get the money value of animals he sees, as someone would with used cars.  What PKD does so great is show how the empathy cult of Mercer, which represents basic idealism and altruism, contrasts with the base capitalist valuation of these animals.<br />I found Mercerism to be one of the most interesting aspects of the novel.  It seems to be the primary way through which people are able to merge together and share an empathic group consciousness.  However, questions are raised as to whether Mercerism is literally true-- one can see clear parallels to Christianity.  By showing a meaningful religion based on lies, I was reminded of Bokononism in Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle.&quot;  Sadly, PKD never enjoyed the literary success of Vonnegut...<br />There is a lot going on in this novel-- one could probably write a novel about this novel.  There are endless ideas and twists upon twists.  However, don't come into it expecting anything like the &quot;cyberpunk&quot; action movie Blade Runner.animals?

This short, simply written novel manages to reveal the latent absurdities in our most cherished institutions: politics, religion, and science.<br />The novel centers around ice-nine, developed by the idiot savant Dr. Hoenikker (sp?).  Hoenikker invents it as something of a game, but its first use will cause the oceans to freeze and the devastation of the world.  We see clear parallels to the nuclear bomb and the rationalizations of its creators: according to them, they are advancing &quot;pure knowledge,&quot; and the consequences are not their concern, even if it results in worldwide devastation.<br />The novel also targets religion in the form of Bokononism, a religion whose own creator admits that it is &quot;foma&quot; (lies).  Even so, the Books of Bokonon cited throughout the book are absurdly sweet and insightful.  The Bokononist practice of &quot;boko-maru,&quot; or merging of soles, also seems to be one of the rare ways to achieve genuine pleasure with one's fellow man.  We see how religion, even where it may be technically false, may give great peace to its believers.  When I first read this book in high school, I was tempted to become a devout Bokononist myself!<br />Vonnegut always emphasizes the importance of family and genuine interhuman relationships, rather than the abstract absurdities of &quot;granfaloons&quot;: nations, parties, sports teams, etc.  This short, spare novel tears apart such granfaloons, and through it, we may see a glimmer of what is genuinely important in our lives.	2003-10-30

That's why it's taught in all the schools.  On the other hand, we have the particular creation myth of the bible, which has no more or less truth than the standard myths of the Romans, Norse Gods, Indian tribes, etc.<br />In this book, Dawkins is trying to give insight into how evolution has operated to make us as we are today.  In so doing, he refutes the primary creationist &quot;argument&quot;: that evolution is random and cannot create complex life.  Of course, natural selection is anything but random.  Organisms that are more successful in surviving tend to pass on more of their genes, creating increasingly successful organisms-- Biology 101.<br />Sadly, the creationists' websites still cite Reverend Paley's &quot;complexity requires design&quot; argument as if it were authoritative.  The &quot;cavemen of creationism&quot; need their belief system and will not succumb to mere reason!  Plenty of people still ascribe to the belief that the world was created 10,000 years ago because the bible says so, when there is plenty of evidence to the contrary.<br />Therefore, the educated skeptic would do well to ignore the one-star creationist &quot;reviews.&quot;  This book provides an interesting introduction to evolution, and neatly counters some of the standard creationist arguments.  While it may not be enough to convert the blinded bible-thumper, it is a stimulating read for those with an open mind.	2003-10-28

In &quot;One L,&quot; Turow supposedly studies 15 hours per day and &quot;learns to love the law&quot; (blech).  In &quot;Brush with the Law,&quot; Marquart and Byrnes ignore law school until the night before finals, and spend most of their time smoking crank and gambling away their student aid.<br />While most law students probably don't smoke crank (at least I didn't), a lot of things in this book are right-on.  First, the fixation on the bell curve of grades.  GPA, Law Review, and big firm jobs become determinants of social worth.  The social scene is so small and insular that gossip and cliques become as big a deal as they were in high school.  Marquart and Byrnes don't buy the B.S., and their outsider perspective on this soul-sucking gamesmanship made me empathize with them as kindred spirits.<br />That said, the ending left something to be desired.  We're brought to the brink of existentialist nihilism, but then the authors have &quot;epiphanies&quot; at the end that seem unconvincing and slapped-on.  Read this book for the take on law school, not for the ending.	2003-10-22

Books	3	19	26	N	N	Fun, Not Deep	First off, let me say that I consider myself a liberal and hate how Dubya is bankrupting our nation and getting our nation mired in frivolous foreign wars.  Whatever happened to the &quot;WMD&quot; and the Iraq-al Qaeda link?!<br />Saying that, this book isn't really fulfilling as political commentary.  Al Franken's &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars That Tell Them&quot; and Brugman's &quot;The Great Unraveling&quot; reveal Dubya's idiocy far more thoroughly.  In fact, in reading this book, I felt that Moore was concentrating far too much on inconsequentials: the fact that Dubya had the bin Ladens escorted out of the U.S. after 9/11 doesn't mean very much, since the bin Ladens have disowned the black sheep Osama, and might have been subject to post-9/11 backlash here.  By concentrating on conspiracy theories rather than facts, Michael Moore seemed almost like the Rush Limbaugh of the Left.<br />I've probably managed to irritate people on both sides of the poltical spectrum now, but I have to state my opinion.  There are many more reasons to despise Dubya, based on sound economics and foreign policy, that Moore doesn't touch upon.<br />Moore is far more talented in filmmaking.  The family being evicted from its home on Christmas in &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; is a far more powerful indictment of right-wing politics than anything in this book.	2003-10-21

Someone is finally standing up to the right-wing rhetoric that the media inundates us with day in, day out.  It's absurd: every time you turn on cable news, some right-winger is bellowing about the downfall of morality in modern times because of the &quot;liberal-controlled media.&quot;  Funny: I can't find one single liberal news show, and believe me, we need one to balance out the bellowing of the right-wingers.<br />While the right-wing morons generally out-shout their opponents, Franken uses humor to deflate their absurd arguments.  He reveals how Fox News is operated and controlled by the right wing, and how preposterous their claim to &quot;fair and balanced&quot; reporting is.  It's a sad state of affairs when a &quot;news&quot; channel can lie outright about its content, and then sue Franken when he exposes these lies.  Someone really should sue Fox News for false advertising or unethical business practices under Cal Bus Code Section 17200.  Fox News is less &quot;fair and balanced&quot; than O'Reilly's last gig on &quot;Inside Edition.&quot;<br />Franken makes short shrift of Coulter, O'Reilly, and Hannity.  It's refreshing that there are voices like Franken's out there.  If one were to go by cable news alone, one would think that America was a nation of brain-dead sycophants in a cult of slave worship to their Chimp Prince Dubya.	2003-09-18

If you've forgotten how bad those jobs were or have never worked one, I highly recommend this book.<br />Beyond that, I'm not sure how useful the book is.  The author purposefully seeks out the worst jobs, which of course she will find.  For example, she leaves a waitressing job to seek out a job as a hotel maid.  Anyone with an ounce of common sense would work their way up in waitressing to better, higher-tipping restaurants.  Everyone knows that being a hotel maid is one of the worst jobs out there, but she is dedicated to working as one.<br />If anyone purposefully seeks substandard jobs, it's not especially surprising that they will find them and that they're going to be quite bad.  I think a better issue to explore would be why people end up in these jobs.<br />The author also tries to portray these jobs as challenging and deserving of respect.  If these jobs are equally challenging, but pay virtually nil, that again raises the issue of why people end up in these jobs.<br />On the other hand, there are real people working these jobs full-time beyond their high school years.  They are human beings and we should empathize with them.  A lot of them probably were trapped in these jobs because they made mistakes in their youth, and now they have no free time to get an education or otherwise improve themselves.<br />I for one would like to know the \\"why\\" of their low socioeconomic positions.  I would also think that education or similar self-improvement would do them better than something like unionizing, which would probably only increase their pay a few dollars per hour.<br />Basically, I thought the book was a good look at the lower rungs of the social strata, but it left a lot unsaid.	2003-09-11

His unique blend of graphic sex and philosophical musing seem distinctively French.  I haven't seen a similar blend in American writers, who tend more towards idealistic puritanism.<br />The narrator here, who is a removed and cynical individual as in the other Houellebecq works I have read...goes through transformations in this work.  At first, he is a mid-level bureaucrat enjoying a prepackaged Thai tour.  He has little respect for the other Frenchmen on the tour but enjoys his brief sojourns to the massage parlors, if only temporarily.  He seems as one resigned to fate, who is used to happiness being rationed in tiny portions.<br />Upon returning to France, the narrator Michel establishes a relationship with Valerie.  How this exactly happens is unclear.  In French writings, the existentialist tendency of things happening to the narrator seems to outweigh the narrator's ability to make things happen. (Somewhat like Vonnegut.)  While it seems unlikely that an antisocial mid-level bureaucrat would find love with an attractive and successful woman like Valerie, it allows us to see the transformation of Michel-- not necessarily into someone more idealistic, but someone more capable of happiness.<br />I won't discuss the ending, as I read about the ending and its overhyped comparisons to \\"real events\\" prior to reading the novel, and this somewhat spoiled the experience of reading it.  Suffice to say that in Houellebecq's worldview, happiness is a fleeting sensation in a world defined by tragedy.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book...	2003-08-31

His writing is just barely adequate.  I would recommend this book only to those  who, like myself, are fascinated by Hunter S. Thompson and want to know  more about the man.  This book is overly long and drags at points.  Some of  the funniest and most exciting stories are marred by a writing style that  borders on the drab.

The book starts off really strong for the first 100 pages or so.  You get to read a detailed, journalistic account of Ramirez' crime spree, and some interesting  information about his youth as well.  But about halfway through, the novel  transforms into one of the most boring courtroom &quot;dramas&quot; you  will ever read.  Carlo details all of the legal maneuvering, but Ramirez is  so blatantly guilty that it is all rather pointless.  And considering how  the lawyers that strive to defend him are so shallow and fame-seeking, and  the groupies that adore him so nasty and mindless, Ramirez almost seems  like the most respectable person in the book.  More detail about the crimes  and less of the courtroom would have made this a far better book.  Ramirez  is only an interesting character because of his sociopathic tendencies.  What happens after his capture can only be trivial and dull by comparison.	1999-06-17

If any book makes reading an effortless exercise, it's this one.  The writing is sharp, tight, and exhilirating.  The action is relentless.<br />Of course, if you're looking for precise historical accuracy, look  elsewhere.  Some have criticized the limitations of Clavell's Japanese.  It  seems obvious that the book uses only a few words for limited effect; it's  not meant to be a primer in the language.<br />The greatest thing about this  novel is its presentation of action, romance, war, and all that good stuff.  It is also interesting to see Blackthorne move from hatred of the Japanese  towards an appreciation of their culture.  It's great when Blackthorne sees  his former comrades-in-arms near the end and feels mostly disdain for them.  Blackthorne seems to feel this disdain because they are not civilized and  sanitary in the Japanese sense.  The Europeans are definitely the  protagonists at the beginning; we can only sympathize when they are beset  by the tortures of Yabu.  But throughout the 1200 pages, Blackthorne learns  and changes.  It's a great journey to be on.	1999-06-16

The characters weren't fleshed out fully enough and the ending was weak.  As someone stated earlier, I found it hard to care that the  killer turned out to be the silent police officer.  We don't know him well  enough to be really shocked.  And why do Alex and Kate have to go their  separate ways?  The book seems to endorse this idea that the two must  remain in their self-enforced isolation, but for no apparent reason.  The  only reason seems to be so that Alex Cross can go on another adventure  without any attachments from a previous novel.<br />The killers themselves  were just plain cheesy, even when we &quot;see through their eyes.&quot;  Their motivations and drives are never satisfactorily elaborated.  Throughout the novel they are described as virile, intelligent, handsome,  athletic men.  But the cop seems a far cry from these descriptions,  silently belligerent and glowering.  And the killings seem to begin through  repressed sexuality, a desire for a woman that can never be realized  because of social inadequacy.  But then how can the killers be so smooth  and attractive at a later date?  I want more from a novel.  Not that I want  it explicitly explained, but give me some insights.  You never really see  in the killer's worlds; their inner monologues are limited to nursery  rhymes.	1999-06-16

If you're looking for a plot moving  towards some ultimate &quot;truth&quot; or resolution, it sure isn't here.  The classics have already done, and overdone, that.

The story goes on to  detail how Michael's life changes and he helps the homeless, but the  transition isn't quite convincing enough.  Grisham is great with quick,  active scenes, but when it comes to inner monologues or personal  transitions, he could use some work.  He describes the external events, but  what exactly IS going on inside Michael's head?

The most fascinating aspect of this novel is its realistic depiction of the legal system.  It shows how ideals become  subverted within the courtroom, where legal machinations tend to take  precedence over altruistic intentions.  It requires a novel of this size to  make that realization felt; you need to suffer through Schlictmann's  journey with him, to the ultimately quixotic ending.  The movie was too  fast, slick, and short, never fully exploring the ambiguities present in  the novel.  The film feels as if it always wants to break into a  Grishamesque chase scene but never quite builds up the steam.  The novel,  on the other hand, allows the space to explore the interior worlds of all  the players.  Is Schlictmann an idealist or an ambulance chaser?  Like the  real world, the answer is none too clear and defies black-and-white  answers.	1999-06-14

I am pretty used to graphic nastiness, having read &quot;American Psycho&quot; and all that good stuff, but this one made  me twitch nonetheless.  Bruce Roberson, as he claws his infected rectum and  strokes himself in a grimy stall, is the most despicable character I have  ever run across in fiction.  His acts aren't quite as vile as the acts in  &quot;American Psycho,&quot; yet he is such a filthy and self-tortured  bastard that it is more painful to read.  And yet the novel is gripping.  Bruce Roberson's worldview, though dementedly skewed, also holds true for  the most part: everyone is a spastic out to screw him over.  And Bruce's  philosophizing tapeworm is damned funny: all of the good intentions in this  human being reside in a simple parasite feeding off his intestines.  It  makes you wonder what it means to be human, or a tapeworm.	1999-06-14

He is, of course, one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century.  He has been much criticized for his participation in the Nazi party, and one could draw a  direct connection from his politics to his philosophy of &quot;falling into  the they.&quot;  We fall into the &quot;they&quot; to avoid the anxiety of  separation.  &quot;There is no I, only the one.&quot;  Human interaction  usually lacks real meaning, consisting of comforting &quot;idle talk.&quot;  His critique of the Cartesian tradition of rationality mind-body dualism  is beautiful, though.  He wrote how rationalism is a derivative abstraction  from emotion. &quot;Being-in-the-world&quot; ontological existence precedes  ontic categories of rationalism.  Rational analysis takes a back seat to  something's direct usefulness &quot;to-hand.&quot;  He also gets into the  nature of time and &quot;Being-towards-Death&quot;... People are always in  the process of Becoming an ideal that is never attained; the ultimate goal  of all life is Death, but we must supress this awareness in order to exist.  An amazing philosophical system that challenges assumptions and shatters  paradigms.	1998-11-20
