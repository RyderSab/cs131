This is a great book for at least 2 key reasons :<br />1) they did it and it works ! They created a SUCCESFUL agency with an 100% ownership equally allocated between every employees ! Whatever are the next step of the story (we enter in recession, and their model will be tested) they had the courage to do it and it worked both one &quot;our&quot; terms (money, growth, ...) and theirs (fun, creativity, ...). I seriously doubt you can export the model beyond the &quot;professional services&quot; sector given the &quot;agency cost&quot; (not ad agency, but &quot;Jensen annd meckling&quot; agency problem) and even but forget theories : this book is about practice and St luke will remain in the history of &quot;organisation design&quot; beyond the agency. Anyway, they did it and it score 1 - 0 for them versus the rest of us.<br />2) The other point is that the book is very well written and that is not so common to find corporate history with such good writing skills combines<br />All done, a very good book where you learn as much about business that about &quot;how ready you are to do it&quot; (being myself an entrepreuneur)	2001-07-23

Let's work on how to repair this !<br />It should be obvious for any executive that this situation occurs everywhere today even though the diagnostic and recommendations are differents : delegation, Key performances indicators (let's focus on these and forget the rest), time management, etc, ...<br />The point is that before the books goes in the implications of attention management (from ch. 8), you read more than half of the book. In the meantime, you learn great thinks about the bioligical reactions of apes, basic stuff about e-commerce techniques, and various other subjects.<br />The book use an original packaging inside (eyes catching tricks) but more attention on the sequence of the book would have provided a roadmap that distinguishes academic readers and attention deficit victims (as myself).<br />I read most of Tom Davenport books and found them excellent but this one deserve an &quot;improved edition&quot; to allow the reader to grab the key issues before he is bored !	2001-06-02

Having work extensensivly in Data Warehousing in the Banking world, I was still able to get some good hints for my projects (and improvement suggestions for already implemented data warehouse)<br />I would suggest any data modeler to read its industry specific chapter before a new project. Also, I would not recommend to duplicate these models : they allow you to focus on the &quot;firm specific&quot; side of your model, so take the benefit of time to customize it rather than duplicate it.	2001-04-10

A Data Warehouse and CRM consultant I was finally expecting the industry reference that would present the role of the Data Warehousing in CRM in clear terms and with authority.<br />In many sense, this is the right book : it provides a broad and knowledgeable overview of the various CRM tools and architecture and how they interact.<br />The problem is that it goes slightly beyond by replacing Data Warehouse by the &quot;Corporate Information Factory&quot; (CIF) Inmon and Inhoff framework which is anything but cristal clear because it adds the Operational Data Store in the picture without answering the real question : why an ODS rather than process automation through EAI ? The book has a whole chapter on the ODS subject but you do not find a real answer to the &quot;do I need one ?&quot; question<br />If you have to do a project after, you might want to read &quot;Designing a Data Warehouse : Supporting Customer Relationship Management&quot; by Chris Todman, very similar title but more data modeling and project oriented.	2001-03-25

The  only difference is that it comes from people who did it and do it day to  day, not from the academia, the examples quoted come from mr.

In 92, during my MBA, I read &quot;Infrotrends&quot; of Mrs Keyes and thought it was a brilliant book. I just finished this one, as a IT banking consultant and I can assure it is very disapointing.<br />First, An  unorganized collection of article is not a handbook, specially not this one  with articles of 5 to 15 pages that cannot dig in the various subjects they  develop.<br />Second, the articles quality is poor to average (except 2 or 3 -  Regarding the &quot;security industry of 6 articles, I skipped but the  previous review might apply)<br />Third, Mrs Keyes contribution is minimal,  with an intriductory chapter about TQM in IT, which does not provide  anything new about the subject. If she is the editor for &quot;fishing  customers&quot; (it worked for me) it's a bad mistake for her long term  reputation ... Four, if you expect to learn anithing specific about IT in  Financial services, you will be disapointed : its mainly, five years old IT  ideas, with a few FS cases. Let remind that, we are speaking about the most  IT intensive industry and a lot could have been written about the core  subjects (new Front and Back office packages emergence, IT Alignement with  strategy, BI and KM implementation, ...). Some of these subjects are evoked  but the analysis is (almost always) too limited ...<br />Unless you want to  decorate your library, don't buy this book, it will save you a fortune  ($175!)	1999-02-21

If you have no clue of  what managing a bank is, you have to read this book. The problem is that if  you work regularly with banks, you will have to dig hard in &quot;bank  management 101&quot;, in other words, all the traditional management model  (BPR, ABC - where Ms Mabberley is an expert, TQM, KAIZEN, ...) in another  fashion ...

The &quot;killer app&quot; principle is very well formalized : prior to that people said &quot;technological innovation that allows you to gain a competitive advantage&quot;.

Some articles are excellent like Clemons that describes the &quot;killer app&quot; (although the term was not coined at the writing) principle and its  relations with pricing and customer base. Most articles are well written  but the treatment is MBA oriented rather that for practitionner. Also, most  authors have a marketing backgroung with gives a bias toward &quot;market  oriented strategies&quot; rather than &quot;ressource based&quot; , alas,  in most case the truth is in the middle ...	1999-01-23

It explain you the &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot; and the challenges that you can expect. The &quot;big lie&quot; chapter alllowed me  to understand the &quot;confusion&quot; between Sales automation and  &quot;close&quot; topics and was very refreshing.

As usual with  this type of books, the &quot;using the information&quot; chapters are a  bit a dry, even thought some interesting ideas are described regarding  &quot;customer information&quot; In summary, a must read for any person  trying to implement a performance indicators or Balanced Scorecard systm in  its bank (&quot;financial institutions&quot; in the title is actually  retail or commercial banking) PS : I am not an E &amp; Y employee ... so  this is not an advertising review	1998-12-03
