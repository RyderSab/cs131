As a physical object, Aughton's &quot;Endeavour&quot; is superb - from the quality of the paper, to the typography, to the richness of the reproductions. The design and layout is novel, imaginative and very attractive. Nota bene - this book is printed in Italy - a provenance for all that is fine in the craft and style of the printing industry.<br />Content wise, you will find most of this material elsewhere, but Aughton's compilation is what makes it such a special work. An illustration of Mataroa Island in New Zealand drawn by one of Cook's companions shows prominent Maori fortifications and villages. This is the site where Cook claimed NZ for the British Crown. Go there today and it has been reclaimed by forest and is home to the endangered SaddleBack bird. It is fascinating to see what has happened in 232 years.<br />Aughton provides an insightful interpretation as to why Cook put so much time and effort into exploring, mapping and &quot;discovering&quot; the East Coast of Australia (pka New Holland). Aughton notes that after completing his successful astronomical mission to Tahiti, Cook opened his secret orders from the Admiralty. &quot;Head west along the 40th Parallel until you reach Terra Australis Incognita&quot;. Beating their way into the teeth of the Roaring Forties winds took a toll on the Endeavour. When he reached Australia, he spent months trying to find a suitable place to careen, refit and re-supply his ship. Aughton implies that the howling westerlies of 40 degrees south may have led indirectly to the British colonisation of Australia. The alternative of course is that Aussies could have been francophones, living in Terre Napoleon.<br />&quot;Endeavour&quot; is a beautiful Cook book. A feast for the eyes as well as the mind - but keep it away from the kitchen.	2003-10-02

It looks closely at the history of the Ozzie wine scene and the trail-blazing vignerons who have elevated this country's wine to world-class status. Nicholas Faith's thesis is that Australians have underplayed the importance of \\"regionalism\\". He then demonstrates that each Australian wine district has very distinctive and attractive attributes. <br />This book is the first comprehensive study of the Australian wine business written by a non-Australian. Faith is an Englishman with expert credentials. He made his name with The Winemasters, the classic 1978 study of Bordeaux. As a contributing editor to the London Financial Times Faith combines a knowledge of wine as one of life's essential joys together with a sharp commercial understanding of the wine industry. <br />The history of the Australian wine scene is covered in more detail by other authors, but Faith, with his international perspective puts the last 200 years of development in a very relevant, topical and balanced context. Faith's stated purpose in writing the book is \\"an attempt to explain the success of Australians in the international wine market since the early 1990s\\". For those readers familiar with the early pioneers and the renaissance of our industry in the 1960s, it may be tempting to skate over the 275 pages it takes Faith to get to the current era. <BR> <BR>With an Englishman's appreciation of pedigree, Faith reminds us there are now dynastic Australian wine families eg the Smiths and Wynns, with up to five generations of viticultural, oenological and wine marketing skills behind them. Interestingly, members of these families are still at the cutting edge of wine innovation.<br />Faith looks at the very topical issue of the two opposing trends in our industry. With the recent large-scale mergers and international rationalisations eg Rosemount/Penfolds and Hardys/Constellation- there is a risk that Australian wine making will become \\"commodified\\". Some critics (particularly the French) argue that industrial scale wine production (even at a high technical standard) leads to bland and characterless wine. The discounting power of supermarket liquor buyers and the squeeze they are putting on the growers and winemakers (both large and small) is seen as the biggest threat to our industry's continued success.<br />Thankfully, there are still the innovative smaller-scale producers who are prepared to experiment and \\"push the envelope\\" when it comes to making their vines and wines sing and dance for our pleasure. Faith reminds us of the increasingly important role of estate-grown (individual vineyard) and \\"hand-made\\" wines.  He assures us Australian producers will continue to carve out valuable niches at this premium end of the market.<br />Faith is optimistic that the most of these competent \\"tin shed\\" wine makers with access to good fruit will survive, despite the increasing dominance of the Big Five wine makers and the pressure of retail liquor discounting. He sees cellar door, mail order and direct sales to restaurants as the key. When coupled with wine regions presented as attractive tourism destinations, the identity and survival of the small labels must be assured.  In support of this, Faith tells us of the habit of the serious French wine consumer who likes to buy wine direct from the producer.<br />The most provocative passage in Faith's book looks at the relative economic power between the grape grower and the wine maker.<br />\\"The whole of Australia is now coming to resemble Champagne, another region of blended wines produced by firms that are renowned for the value of their brands but - with a few exceptions - can supply only a small proportion of the grapes they require.\\"<br />On first reading, you might think Faith has seen too many bottles on the shelves of Sainsbury's bearing the label \\"Product of South-Eastern Australia\\". However, statistics are on Faith's side. Recent numbers from the Australian Wine Industry Directory (Wine Titles 2003) show that the Top 22 winemakers own or lease only 20% of the total area of Australia's vineyards. To the outsider, the power would seem to be in the hands of the grower but, increasingly, the winemakers apply a rigorous grading system when buying fruit, and will reject grapes that are of inferior quality.<br />A close reading of the book reveals a few annoying typos and oversights. One example is the name of Penfold's former Chief Viticulturist in South Australia: David Murdock. Faith spells it Murdoch.<br />Late in the book, he tells us that the Margaret River region of Western Australia is the only region in the world that was recommended geologically as having soil-types suitable for wine-grape growing - this was before the first vine was planted. However, in an earlier chapter we are told that the founders of the Barossa Valley region in South Australia in the 1830s also consulted a mineralogist before committing to their vineyard plantings. <br />Faith demonstrates that terroir and regionalism does underpin much of the qualities that we see in Australian wine. He reminds us that Brian Croser's bold move into the Adelaide Hills and Andrew Pirie's rigorous selection of Pipers Brook was driven by a belief that the soils and climate characteristics of Burgundy could be found in parts of Australia. The emergence of great local pinots is a result of this combination of science and passion.<br />One familiar aspect of both the earliest and current generation of Australian vignerons is the large number of medical doctors who got themselves involved with grapes and wine. Faith tells us about the pragmatic and pioneering doctors of the 1800s who grew grapes and recommended wine as a health-giving tonic. The modern generation of winemaking medicos seems to be more inspired by the need for relief from the pain of taxation. Either way the restorative power of Australian wine is firmly based. <br />When you finish reading \\"Liquid Gold\\" you may be obliged to lift a glass and thank Mr Faith for writing such an informative, provocative and entertaining book.	2003-07-15

Of course, the publicity machines have gone into hyper-drive. Media coverage has been worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster. And following a first reading, with all the anticipation and hoopla we have been given, this book is a disappointment. <br />In terms of production quality this book (the OZ edition) is printed on very cheap , paper-back quality paper. Not a good look for an expensive hardcover...<br />As for the content .... it's more than 30 years since the Women's Lib movement gave women the confidence to make their names ... and stake their claims in their own right. However we still have many women whose profile and identity is purely a product of what their husbands are ... or were. <br />But has the path that Hilary Clinton's life has taken warrant the beatification ... she now expects. Does this memoir give us something of substance? No ... it's full of ephemera and trivia, and as a purported history it will surely be classified by future scholars of \\"The Clinton Years\\" as just superficial marginalia. It's a shallow package that only highlights and confirms the duplicity and deceit of many of those who \\"make it\\" in high political office. <br />It's a shame there is no reference in \\"Living History\\" to the \\"fact\\" that Mrs Clinton was named after that famous New Zealand mountaineer (Sir Edmund H). This is according to a 1999 interview in NZ with her mom Dorothy Rodham --- It's now exactly 50 years since Mt Everest was climbed and 56 years since Hillary Rodham was born. In 1947, Sir Ed was an unknown Kiwi beekeeper. It looks like tall stories are the only things the two Hillarys have in common.	2003-06-13
US	48499195	R38D1HPIQAPSJH	0224050060	482257920	Australia : A Biography of a Nation	Books	1	4	4	N	N	RETURN OF THE EXPATRIATE	.<br />Phillip Knightley says English journalists, when visiting Australia for the first time, can't help but exaggerate their experiences. After such a long absence from Australia you would have to call Knightley more a Pom than an Aussie. Right from the first chapter of \\"Australia - A Biography of a Nation\\" the author falls into the journalistic trap of not letting objectivity get in the way of a good story. <br />Knightley has the typical view of the expats who left Australia during the 1949-66 reign of the Liberal PM Sir Robert Menzies. He has little time for that remarkable man and the uninterrupted growth in prosperity he delivered. To reinforce his prejudices he tells us that Menzies came from a privileged \\"born to rule\\" background. In fact Menzies came from a family of modest means. His father had a general store in a small country town in Victoria and his mother's father was a leader of a gold miner's trade union. The fact that Menzies was a \\"scholarship boy\\" belies Knightley's description. <br />Let's flip forward to another notable Australian Prime Minister of the last 40 years. Edward Gough Whitlam had a very brief ascendancy. He was PM for 2 years and 10 months. For those who idolise him it will remain \\"The Whitlam Era\\"; and so Knightley's Chapter 17 is duly titled. <br />We all know \\"a week is a long time in politics\\" but you would need to invoke time dilation and Special Relativity to turn 34 months into an era. <br />The dismissal of Gough by the Governor General Sir John Kerr on November 11 1975 sees Knightley wheel out his favourite conspiracy theories including shadowy CIA sponsored possibilities. <br />One of the most remarkable admissions by Knightley is the fact that his wife (at the time) was a telex operator in the London office of the Pakistani commodity trader Tirath Khemlani. Khemlani was appointed by the Whitlam government to find a four billion-petrodollar loan to help fund the massive spending spree that they had embarked upon. When theMinister responsible (Rex Connor) was told to terminate the negotiations because of the unsavoury associations, Connor persisted in his discussions. When you recall Knightley's familiarity with the spooky world of Philby and Profumo, the existence of leaked telexes which lead to a government's downfall has an unusually strong scent of intramural associations. <br />Whitlam's fall is also, in part, attributed by Knightley to Rupert \\"The Dirty Digger\\" Murdoch. Murdoch's energetic promotion of Whitlam's cause in 1972 followed by the equally harsh criticism in 1975 was seen in Labor circles as traitorous. Of course, those who were the beneficiaries of Whitlam's patronage saw his short and inept reign as being beyond criticism. <br />Knightley correctly identifies that a real Australian success has been managing the transition from a mono-cultural Anglo-flavoured society into the confident, outward looking, culturally diverse nation that it is today. <br />Knightley portrays Arthur Calwell the Labor Immigration Minister (1945-49) as some xenophobic relic. In fact it was Calwell who encouraged the migration of Southern Europeans to Australia at a time when Briton's were still amused by the expression \\"Wogs start at Calais\\". <br />We now have 2nd generation Italian and Greek Australians as leaders across Australian society. Knightley denigrates Calwell and gives no recognition to his pioneering role in making a multi-cultural Australia. <br />Knightley's viewpoint is blatantly Sydney-centric. This is not surprising when he admits that he sees Britain through the eyes of Londoner. This geographic blinkering can lead to a lack of objectivity. He names the alma mater of Germaine Greer (every thinking Australian males pin-up girl(?)) as Sydney University. In fact she was a graduate of Melbourne University who happened to move up the road to do her MA. <br />Knightley sees the Sydney Gay Mardi Gras as the most emblematic of the cultural shifts that have occurred in Australia.By a remarkable coincidence so did Robert Hughes in his recent TV series which re-visited the \\"The Fatal Shore\\". <br />In the past 10 years, advancement of indigenous Australian's rights has become central to much public debate. Knightley recognises this and the progress that is being made. However he ignores one of the key fallacies underlying the new policy agendas. <br />Knightley, together with many other commentators, unquestioningly accepts the wisdom of the Mabo High Court decision. This case marked a watershed in Aboriginal rights in Australia. It overturned the concept of Australia being a \\"terra nullius\\". The test case applied to a group of Torres Strait people who are of Melanesian origin. They are distinct culturally and ethnically from the mainland aborigines. These Islanders have long established traditions of \\"gardening\\" in contrast to the traditional hunter-gatherers who lived on the mainland. The Mabo Case has been extended to the recent Wik decision. This has profound implications for land holder's rights throughout Australia. <br />Knightley's own definition of \\"terra nullius\\" (p314) includes land that is uncultivated. Mainland aborigines have never been observed to till and harvest their land in a continuous and systematic manner. <br />Knightley's \\"Biography of a Nation\\" falls short in many areas. Australia is the only nation occupying a continent. It is a very ancient landmass. Can we have a meaningful biography of such an entity? If the term can be applied to a nation, then a more intensive, broad reaching and balanced consideration should be provided. Instead, this book is one man's attempt to try and catch up with all that he has missed out on during a mere (in geological terms) 40-year absence. Contrast this with the latest news from anthropologists. Australians have been around for 50,000 years. Happy Birthday Australia!	2002-10-19

Structurally the text contains frequent convolute passages and at times, repetitious detail. Particularly annoying is Gurney's tendency to refer to his characters' ages in many passages. Yet often we are not given the year in which he's talking about and it's impossible to work this out from the context.

No evidence is provided by Gurney that the 3 countries were in a race, as the title of the book boldly purports.<br />By most people's reckoning, the most exciting phase of Antarctic exploration would have to be the real race, the one to the South Pole that took place in the early years of the 20th Century. Gurney's book serves really only as a preliminary \\"backgrounder\\" for readers who wish to understand these later events.

When do you say alternately or should it be alternatively? These are words we hear everyday; but they are often confused and misused, even in the mainstream media. Help is at hand. The famous English author Kingsley Amis's last book The King's English will provide professional writers and those who care about their language, expert guidance in the usage of English. <br />Amis is best known for his novels such as Lucky Jim and the Old Devils, but he was also a skilled observer and commentator on late 20th Century life and language. Amis died in 1995, with this book being published posthumously, two years later.<br />In this book, he takes us from the classic formalism of old-school academic scholars with their groundings in Latin and Greek, through to the street-wise pop-media of the contemporary world. He bridges the gap between the rigorous, proscribed rules of the original 1926 classic H.W. Fowler's Modern English Usage and the modern, pragmatic world where English is recognised as the global language. Despite being an Englishman, Amis acknowledged the ascendancy and the practical \\"correctness\\" of American English.<br />Amis in his book is very careful not to be too pedantic with his comments. In his entry on the pronunciation of kilometre, he argues against the common practice of stressing the second syllable and therefore making it sound like a device to measure items grouped in thousands. Amis assures us such a device once existed, but he concludes \\"not many people know that, or would care if they did.\\"<br />Amis has fun criticising - and gently mocking - fashionable trends in writing, particularly in the field of newspaper journalism.  In his entry on headlines, Amis gives examples of sub-editors stringing together three or more nouns to make a headline, such as, SCHOOL COACH CRASH DRAMA. He also criticises the journalistic trick of overloading descriptions in one sentence, which he calls the \\"gorged-snake construction.\\"<br />Political abuse of the language is also put under the Amis spotlight. How often do we hear politicians \\"refuting\\", when all they are doing is denying, and not proving the falsity of the allegation, which is what the word really means?<br />The King's English is not an exhaustive guide to language use, but anybody who makes a living from writing or takes other people's writing seriously will want to keep a copy of this book close by their dictionary. Should we be implying or inferring this? Either way, this book is inspirational, amusing as well as instructive.	2002-08-06

It is near impossible to avoid the effects of its toxic content.  <br />If you like joyless and bleak writing, that reads like a transcript of a very bad dream, this book is for you. If you would enjoy inhabiting a world were everything is covered with slime, mould and other sundry excrescences you may find pleasure in this book's pages. When you read this book, you are immersed in a delusional and deranged mind-space.<br />Van Dieman Land  (p.k.a. Tasmania) in the first half of the 19th Century provides one of the most gothic settings an author could ever want for a novel. The greatest Australian book, Marcus Clarke's \\"For the Term of His Natural Life\\" remains the definitive tale from this time and place. When you couple the British-Australian involuntary tourism system (ie. convict transportation 1788-1852) with the sad demise of the Tasmanian indigenous population you have very powerful ingredients with which to build a tale or two. Richard Flanagan in this novel takes us into every dark, dank cranny and crevice he believes this world was made of.<br />Flanagan's style shows schoolboyish delight when he wallows in words like \\"putrefying\\" and \\"purulent\\". He does this so convincingly, that repugnance and nausea could result in the squeamish reader. He unashamedly, takes us into a world which, in his own words, is an \\"alternative reality\\", with its sustained hallucinatory passages.<br />Towards the final chapters, Flanagan attempts to draw some meaning or lessons from this morass of splintered and sinister ugliness. In the sub-text, he is asking questions such as \\"should contemporary Australians carry the blame and guilt for the undoubted barbarisms committed nearly two centuries ago?\\" The whole dramatic locution is deflated when his earlier puffed-up strident hyperbolism is punctured in the later, more reflective passages. The blunt shtick of fashionable post-modern cultural relativism, when employed by Flanagan, leaves us answerless. <br />Having \\"dipped his quill in demons\\" the utility of this book remains in its role as a purgative for those who need such things. The following passage sums up Flanagan's lead character's approach to physical (and psychic?) self-help.  \\"Vomiting is not a bad thing, it rids the body of unwanted fluids & humours & prevents the continuing horrors of crapulence and flatulence the following day\\".   <br />Flanagan is constantly decrying what he considers the abuses of the \\"scientifick\\" approach to the natural world, which was at its zenith in the early 1800s. The founder of botany, Linnaeus, is dismissed as just a collector and classifier of flowers.<br />Flanagan's cleverness has him using \\"The Enlightenment\\" as a euphemism for sexual intercourse, and \\"The Great Philosopher\\" was a perfume bottle pressed into service as a dildo, which was in the shape of a bust of Voltaire. <br />The dilemma of all creative people is posited by Flanagan, when his protagonist Gould claims \\" I was hurt by this world into making my soul transparent for all the world to see\\", but the artist and writer's rewards flow when \\"... his preposterous opinions are deemed significant\\"<BR>      <BR>For the non-Australian reader, a dictionary of Aussie slang would be a handy companion to this book. Sayings such as \\"Cobbers aren't dobbers\\" could confound many [translation: true friends don't betray each other]. Flanagan even gives us some \\"Tasmanianisms\\" which many \\"Mainlanders\\" could struggle with. Try \\"deadflog\\" for size.  It's word still used in Tasmania, which must have been first coined by the whippers or the whippees of 200 years ago.<br />It seems that all books in Flanagan's world, including \\"journals of record\\" are just \\"unreliable fairy tales\\". They are not \\"flotsam of the romantic past ... but evidence of a rotten present\\".<br />With his convict-era protagonist being a forger and his present day narrator being a faker of antique furniture (to be sold to gullible American tourists), the loop is closed when the author reveals unashamedly that everything in the book is built on manufactured \\"realities\\". This is all very clever, but at its nub, this book is no more than a charade or parlour game relying on verbal gymnastics, and hypnotic literary mirrors. This is a book posing as something of substance but when you've polished it off there is nothing left but a puff of insubstantial ephemera, and a very bad taste in your mouth.	2002-03-22

There's no math to frighten the innumerate and everything is written in challenge-free language. The average tabloid newspaper browser with the reading age of a 12-year-old would be comfortable with this book. <br />The scope of this book could not be broader. It's &quot;everything you want to know about light&quot;, written from a historical perspective. It takes us from the wisdom of the ancients, through the insights of Galileo and Newton and ultimately to the exciting possibilities of our post-Einsteinian world. With all this ground to cover, Brain Clegg never really attempts to penetrate or take his topic apart, but rather he just skates around the surface. With his lightweight journalistic style, he sees his role as closer to entertainer rather than educator. There is no serious attempt at elucidation (shedding of light) beyond a feint, superficial illumination.<br />The structure of the book is in the form of a chronological series of potted biographies of the great luminaries. The author obviously found himself a &quot;Boy's Own Bumper Book&quot; of amazing scientific history and strung together all the references he could find on light and optics. It's very formulaic and it shows. There's not an original insight, in sight. <br />It is acknowledged that there is a well-deserved place for popular science books in the market place. The real test of their effectiveness is their ability to build a reader's curiosity and to generate a desire to explore a subject in more depth. Instead, after reading this book, you feel bloated as if you have just ingested a big bucket of popcorn. It's all sugar coated literary carbohydrate. Your appetite for the science of optics is blunted, but not satisfied, just like at the movies, you are still in the dark, and the lights have yet to come up.<br />When considering this book claims to explore the possibility of time travel (as promised by the title), we have to work our way to the last few chapters before the strange world of quantum phenomena is even touched on.<br />We get a few titillating references to some recent breakthroughs in  &quot;superluminary&quot; phenomena but it is all very tentative and less than convincing. The author would have been better of giving us more details on well -established quantum phenomena and its applications in (opto-) photo-electronic technology.<br />He gives us a few words on lasers and holograms, but the amazing world of semiconductors and the related field of photonic devices such as LEDs which are now so commonplace, is barely touched. He tantalizes us with the implications of entangled photons, and what that might mean for Star Trek-like teleporting, but the exciting breakthroughs that are happening in the world of quantum computing are not even hinted at.<br />While it is great to see more books targeting that growing audience which wants to learn more about science, books such as this one doesn't venture further than a typical Readers Digest article or Discovery Channel program. To his credit, Brain Clegg gives Richard Feynman (one of the greatest scientists and communicators of the 20th Century) rightful prominence in this book. However readers would be better off reading Feynman's very accessible  &quot;QED:The Strange Theory of Light and matter&quot;.<br />It's interesting to note that when this book was originally published last year (2001) in the UK it had the simpler title &quot;Light Years&quot;. For the North American market we got the addition of &quot;... and Time Travel&quot;. Crossing the Atlantic certainly involves some time travel, but you can be sure this book will never make it as an instruction manual for aspiring Captain James T. Kirks.	2002-01-22

One thing is for sure; it is not a history book. It is, instead, a garbled, confused and at times, barely literate attempt at writing a psychodrama based on the life of that most famous of navigators, Captain James Cook.<br />You would think an author who wants to write about voyages of discovery, and purports to have done his research by following his subject's tracks around the globe would have his basic geography under control. We have Dugard wandering around London (UK) not knowing what side of the Thames River he is on. He takes us on a walk from the Deptford Docks near Greenwich (on the south bank) to Cook's house in the East End of London, without crossing the river! He takes us along famous London thoroughfares like Regency (sic) Street and Savile (sic once again) Row.<br />You would hope a book like this might have some useful maps. There is an attempt at one. Right up front of the book we get a chart of the world showing the tracks of the ships taken in Cook's three voyages. This map however is totally useless. The essence of Cook's peregrination around the Pacific saw him often crossing his paths and doubling back. The map in this book has tracks without arrows. You can't tell where he's come from or where he's going!<br />Dugard's inventiveness really comes into its own when he attempts to go inside the head of Cook. He gives us the passionate details of his relationship with his wife Elizabeth. The fact that Mrs Cook burnt all her correspondence with her husband before she died, and the total lack of details in Cook's own records of his personal life is a real convenience for the imaginative author.<br />Dugard's thesis is that Cook's eventual downfall at the hands of the Hawaiian BBQ Kings was due to an egotism that was verging on psychotic. Whenever the author starts to develop a case for a particular aspect of Cook's personality or a behavioural trait he goes and destroys his own argument a few pages later. Take the following two extracts as an example.<br />On p124 we have, &quot;Cook had always taken a quiet pride in being in touch with his crew's emotions. Their worries and fears became his, for in his heart he was still one of them.&quot; Only 26 pages later we have, &quot;He had always been detached and reclusive, absorbed in his own thoughts and dreams. But after this trip he became even less aware of other's needs&quot;.<br />Dugard also invents another motive for Cook's zeal for discovery. On at least 6 occasions in the book he claims Cook wanted to &quot;wipe off the map&quot; previous explorers contributions to cartography. The author provides zero evidence for this. In fact, immediately prior to one of these repeated claims on p216, he had just provided a quote from Cook's journal which shows the great navigator (contrary to Dugard's thesis) was only too willing to recognize the work of the explorers who went before him.<br />When Dugrad writes about common maritime practice and procedures, even the lay reader would be left gasping at his ignorance. In one account where Cook's ship is wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, he tells us (twice) that it was Cook's &quot;gut instinct&quot; that the evening tide that day would be higher than the previous high tide seen during the day. Even a weekend sailor could have worked that out from a few prior observations.<br />Dugard's attempts at literary &quot;style&quot; fall in a heap. He tries to conjure up some 18th Century atmosphere by using lingo like &quot;unbeknownst&quot;. A few paras later he goes and shatters it with modern metaphors like &quot;laser-like intensity&quot;.<br />As an historic travelogue to places familiar to the 21st Century tourist, any visitor-info website could replace this book. For example, Dugard describes the entrance to Sydney Harbour as being between &quot;two towering basalt heads&quot;. The golden cliffs of sandstone that erode to make thefamous beaches of Bondi must have popped into existence in the last 200 years!<br />There is no shortage of great books written about the life and times of Captain Cook. An AMAZON search will give you the Penguin Classic &quot;The Journals of Captain Cook&quot; (you cannot go past the man's own words) or John C. Beaglehole's &quot;The Life of Captain James Cook&quot;.<br />It is sad to see the publishing industry churning out &quot;pot-boilers&quot; like this book. With all the bloopers, inconsistencies and non sequitur logic in this text it hard to believe there were any editorial disciplines interposed between the author's manuscript and the printing press.<br />As a Cook Book this one belongs in the bargain bin --- right alongside titles like &quot;101 Recipes for Olde English Style BBQ&quot;.the famous beaches of Bondi must have popped into existence in the last 200 years! <br />There is no shortage of great books written about the life and times of Captain Cook.

AND SOMETHING DEEPER	.<br />Many of us as children would have first discovered the wonder-full world of science, by doing chemistry &quot;experiments&quot; and studying minerals. Oliver Sacks, when recounting his boyhood, takes us back to that time, when chemical reactions with their magical color changes, would open a child's imagination. This could feed their curiosity, and in turn, put them on a path to knowledge. <br />Sacks writes with crystalline clarity. He describes his childhood passion for science in a way that is intense, immediate and refreshing. Have chemical properties ever been described so lyrically? &quot; The color of lilacs in spring for me is that of divalent vanadium. Radishes for me evoke the smell of vanadium&quot;.<br />Science for young Sacks went well beyond the bounds of facts and figures.  For him it was almost a sensual and at times a spiritual thing. He uses musical analogies when describing the harmonics inherent in the symmetries of the Periodic Table of Elements. <br />Sacks unashamedly worships his scientific heroes. The great French chemist Lavoisier, was the first to develop a symbolic notation for chemical reactions that went beyond the simple icono-graphics (shorthand or cryptology?) of the alchemists. Sacks equates Lavoisier's &quot;Elements of Chemistry&quot; with Isaac Newton's &quot;Principia&quot;. <br />With the invention of new scientific languages (eg chemical equations), advancement was no longer limited to the empiricism of the laboratory bench.  New materials and processes could be conceptualized as &quot;thought experiments&quot; or put on paper, well before their actual discovery. Sacks marvels at the ability of the pioneering chemists who predicted the existence of new elements, purely by reason and deduction.<br />To the average person, science is often seen as a dry, cerebral, passionless activity. Sacks's strength as a writer is his ability to capture the exuberance and enthusiasm that underpins and drives most scientific ventures.<br />Many of Sacks's observations, although superficially simple, are in fact, profound. He reminds us that the crystalline symmetries seen in minerals are reflections of underlying atomic structures. Metals look metallic because of their surface's interaction with photons.<br />His personal voyage takes us from the simple causes and effects of the pre-quantum mechanical world of his younger days to the probabilistic uncertainties of the causeless (blameless?) adult world.<br />Sacks' writing provokes the thought, &quot;how many quantum-related phenomena can we now see in our macro-world?&quot; The random walk of Brownian motion (at a micro level) is everywhere, but the inverse-squared relationships (at a macro level) that are a consequence of Brownian paths, lead us to those step-like jumps that define &quot;events&quot; all around us, for example, everyday photoelectric phenomena.    <br />Oliver Sacks must take the prize for being the most accessible writer of things cerebral. He doesn't allow his own intelligence to get in the way of being a clear communicator. His modesty is engaging. The understated revelation that it was Sacks as a 12 year-old on a British radio quiz show in 1945, who got Glen Seaborg to reveal the discovery of the latest trans-uranic elements, is buried in footnote 11 on p210.<br />One of the key messages in these memoirs is the importance of mentors to the young, growing mind. It was the advice, influence and support from Sacks' relatives, in particular Uncle Dave (U. Tungsten of the title) that allowed Oliver's potential to blossom.<br />There is only one detectable blooper in this biography, but whether it was Uncle Tungsten's or the author's is unclear. It is on the subject of the origin of diamonds. On p37. Uncle Dave is quoted by Oliver as saying &quot;they are brought to the surface in kimberlite, tracking hundreds of miles from the earth's mantle, and then through the crust, very, very slowly, till they finally reached the surface&quot;. Yet, on p129, one of Oliver's heroes, Sir Humphrey Davy is &quot;burning a diamond&quot;. Most geological textbooks will tell you that for diamonds to make it through to the earth's surface they have to be transported from the mantle extremely rapidly to avoid being turned into graphite or CO2.<br />The underlying theme of &quot;Uncle Tungsten&quot; is the convergence and ultimate unity, between man, the material world and the transcendental. It takes somebody with the intellect and power of communication like Oliver Sacks to convince us that our physical world, the domain of mind and ideas, and whatever is beyond, are bound together inseparably.<br />This book has to be rated as one of the best memoirs of its kind. Oliver Sacks' earlier works must now become essential (re-) reading.	2002-01-06

In &lt;&lt; Fury &gt;&gt;, he certainly gives the Summer of 2000 in New York City the old Sodom and Gomorrah treatment. <br />To really get into this book it pays to have a dictionary of classical Greek mythology handy. All the references to residents of Olympus such as Kronos (aka Old Father Time with his scythe who does the deed on his daughter) and other sundry deities and demons may need a bit of explaining.<br />Similarly, Old Bill the Bard gets a fair workout as well. Rushdie lifts lines from Shakespeare's plays (often without attribution). I guess this is OK since Bill's been dead 400 years, and nobody reads him now anyway.<br />Rushdie uses the dramatic devices seen in &lt;&lt; King Lear &gt;&gt;, where the madness of the principle protagonist, is mirrored by the chaos and storms in his surrounding physical world.<br />Rushdie, like his hero Malik Solanka has an obvious love-hate relationship with NYC and the USA. He is charmed and intoxicated by the vibrancy and creativity of the city and the culture it breeds, but at the same time is repelled by the decadent, transient vicariousness of it all.<br />Some excerpts from &lt;&lt; Fury &gt;&gt; show how close Rushdie came to forecasting the mid-summer madness of the first year of Millennia III.<br />On p.44 his observation  &quot; America, in the highest hour of its hybrid, omnivorous power&quot; is compared to &quot;the last days of Rome&quot;.<br />We have Solanka riding in a cab, and with his knowledge of the Urdu language understands the blasphemies and curses of Ali the newly emigrated Pakistani taxi-driver. When Ali screams at other road users, Solanka (or more likely Rushdie) sees &quot;... some misguided collectivist spirit of paranoiac pan-Islamic solidarity, he blamed all New York road users for the tribulations of the Muslim world&quot;.<br />The spookiest paragraph in the book is on p114.<br />&quot;A Concorde crashed in France, and people imagined they saw a part of their own dreams of the future, the future in which they too would break through the barriers that had held them back, the imaginary future of their own limitlessness, going up in those awful flames&quot;.<br />Rushdie's incorporation of mid-2000 contemporary events both as background and central scenes gives a strong immediacy to the novel. He even takes us to the South Pacific, where a thinly disguised Fiji and the coup it experienced last year becomes a pivotal event in the denouement of the story.<br />However, once our lead character escapes the realities and intensities of New York, the narrative descends rapidly into melodrama. After all the real-time buzz and credible scenes of the front end of the story, the cathartic nemeses we expect of a classical scholar like Rushdie, arrive far too predicably. <br />In the book, we have Rushdie and his characters, considering the possibilities of open-ended, collaborative, cyberspace linked, story telling and game playing. <br />Perhaps the author should have put down his pen for 12 months in mid-2000, and let the realities of 2001 complete the story for him.	2001-11-12

The copper embossed dust cover hints at the treasure buried within. From its binding, to the choice of paper to the fine etched illustrations, this is a very classy book.<br />Winchester takes us aboard one of the most effective literary time machines ever to land on a bookshelf. His writing sweeps us back 200 years to an England that was going through an industrial, scientific and social revolution.<br />Coal was king. Coal was the fuel for steam power. In turn, steam drove Britannia's economic engines.<br />William Smith was skilled as a geologist, engineer and cartographer. His observations and maps allowed landowners to discover and exploit the coal resources that lay beneath their land.<br />Smith's science went well beyond that of defining the strata containing the valuable coal. He devised the concept of stratigraphy, which would allow the relative age and spatial distribution of sedimentary rocks to be quantified. <br />It was this work, that inspired Smith's fellow geologist Charles Lyell to write &quot;The Principles of Geology&quot;. When Charles Darwin went on his voyage of discovery it was the geological insights of Lyell and Smith that allowed Darwin to conceive of the vastness of the geological time scale. It is Winchester's thesis that Smith's map changed the world because of this direct influence on the most revolutionary scientific thinker of the 19th Century.<br />In the mid-1800s thanks to Darwin, geology was considered to be &quot;The Father of Sciences&quot;.<br />The beauty of Winchester's writing is his evocation of the world in which Smith lived 200 years ago. His description of the English landscapes brings home to us the relationship between the underlying rocks and the aesthetics of the natural scenery we see around us. <br />Winchester's skills as a travel writer shine through. He surveys not only the landforms but also the social and political landscapes of this era. His clever use of the vocabulary of the era gives us a world inhabited by such people as beadles, tipstaffs and summoners.  We travel in a conveyance called a myrmidon. His research is impeccable. We learn that there was an actual prison in London called &quot;The Clink&quot;, and that the game of rackets or squash was invented in a debtors jail. <br />This book deserves its status as on of the great books of 2001. It should encourage readers to go back to Winchester's early work, particularly his travel writing. For readers who wish to learn more about Smith's influence on science should read Lyell's &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; which still in print as a Classic. This is the book that Charles Darwin took on his voyage of discovery. &quot;The Map That Changed the World&quot; will take you on your very own voyage of discovery.	2001-08-09

In those days, it was the newspapers (and not the TV networks) who called the shots.<br />Evelyn Waugh in his inimitable, over-the-top style goes right to the heart of the media business. It's not about delivering news; it's pure power politics. The egos of the media owner are the prime drivers of the machinations of this industry. Their bungling underlings are constantly in damage control and covering up their incompetencies.<br />Only Waugh could get away with these observations on indigenous Africa. His descriptions of the supposedly fictitious Democratic Republic in Africa (20 years before most of the continent went independent of their colonial masters) is pure clairvoyance.<br />Most of Africa today is just like his Ishmaelia. So-called democracies run by autocratic Presidents-for-Life.<br />This book as well as being a primer for foreign correspondents, is an excellent manual for students of African politics.<br />Unfortunately, for many readers on the West Side of the Atlantic, Waugh's subtle ironic style might be at times impenetrable. Rule one with Waugh is never to take things at face value. He was a brave and clever man to get away with the demolition jobs he does on his own class ridden British society.<br />Once you twig to his wit, his writing becomes a pure pleasure. There is never a dull moment. His observations on society, politics, business and the human condition are timeless.<br />Waugh is the master of 20th century satirical literary humour. Scoop is one of his best.	2001-08-07
US	48499195	R2O7CQWAFVILDZ	1589040058	192486984	The Child and the Machine: How Computers Put Our Children's Education at Risk	Books	1	12	20	N	N	OR WHY COMPUTERS MAKE OLD-STYLE EDUCATORS FEEL INADEQUATE	.<br />We can presume this book's intended audience is the legion of teachers and education bureaucrats who cringe every time they hear the phrase \\"computers in the classroom\\". <br />Their biggest dilemma and their most justifiable concern are the expense of the hardware and the short-life of your typical PC. Educational dollars are finite and mistakes can be expensive. The big bonus though, is that as computers have become more powerful, they are at the same rate becoming cheaper.<br />Alison Armstrong and Charles Casement in their book make a fundamental mistake in their approach to the impact of computers on children's education. They focus predominantly on the hardware and human interface issue. Surely the power and impact of IT is not all about the box that sit on our desks but instead it is the world of knowledge and the creative tools that brings value, pleasure and rewards to all of us.<br />Since this book must have been written for an audience of educators, academics and \\"concerned parents\\", it sensibly provides us with a comprehensive set of footnotes and bibliography. Unfortunately, the index is useless. I thought I'd check out references to Yahoo! There are two, the second being on page 200. Nowhere is Yahoo mentioned on that page. Similarly references to Nicholas Negroponte. We found a couple of references to his \\"Being Digital\\" when reading the book, but the writers casually dismiss his ideas in a few lines . Whoever indexed their book should polish up their search tools since the index often leads us nowhere.<br />When you consider  Yahoo searches are damned by the authors, and considered  to be such a difficult and confusing task for a child, imagine how a serious reader of their book feels when references to Yahoo in their own index lead you astray.<br />[The writers] still see knowledge as a Cartesian world of library shelves and card index files. The new technology and its impact on education are not simple computer aided instruction tools or smartish auxiliary teachers. Instead, they offer a gateway into a whole new world.  Cyberspace is all about a network of relationships; not a series of neatly catalogued and cross-referenced facts and figures. <br />The authors remind me of the guys who walked in front of the first steam locos waving a red flag. This time round its the youngsters who are driving the trains ( and designing and building them) , and its the parents and teachers who are cowering in fear of the new technology. <br />This book relies mainly on anecdotal accounts when developing their arguments about the dangers of computers in the classroom. There is very little objective statistics or fact-based research in this book. All this book succeeds in doing is reinforcing the prejudices of the anti-computer lobby. Its Canadian origins shine through with its none too subtle references to the tainted world of American commercialism. <br />To be more credible the writers could have broadened their field of research to the Scandinavians (particularly the Finnish) who are leaders in the application of IT in education. <br />Since the topic of this book deals with such an important area for all of us it is disappointing to see it treated in such a shallow and one-dimensional manner.	2001-07-24

They nearly always have a sinister, sometimes scary story line. &quot;Clay Boy&quot; is no exception.<br />The concept of a clay boy that comes to life is very reminiscent of Pinocchio. An elderly couple known as Grandpa and Grandma are lonely now that their children have grown up. The clay boy is to become their child substitute.<br />There is one big problem when he comes alive. He is insatiably hungry. He eats and eats, and he grows and grows until he ate all the food in the house. &quot;More More&quot; he cries.<br />Now things get a little macabre. He's seen gulping down whole live chickens, and then the geese, cat and dog are consumed. Then it's Grandma and Grandpa's turn to be on the menu.<br />By now, Clay Boy is of giant proportions.  In one bite, he eats a man, a wagon, a horse and a load of hay. GULP!<br />He is still unsatisfied, after swallowing everybody in the village.<br />But then, he meets his match.<br />A very cunning goat (check out the face on this Billy) offers to jump straight into Clay Boy's mouth, but on one condition: Clay Boy has to close his eyes.<br />The goat took a great leap straight at the big fat belly.  Clay Boy broke into a hundred pieces and all the people and animals that he had swallowed tumbled out. The goat was the hero of the village and had his horns painted gold. Such rejoicing!<br />No explicit moral is given in this story. But what does this folk tale tell us? Will insatiable greed and endless consumption lead only to annihilation? <br />There is also a modern message here. Now that most of us live far removed from our parent's homes, perhaps we should spend more time with our folks so they don't get lonely. And for Grandma and Grandpa, they should accept that their children have grown up, and should not try to find substitutes for this loss.<br />The last page brings this home. The role of Grandparents is to instil and pass on their wisdom to their grandchildren. The best way to do this is to be a story- teller for the young ones and ideally, pass on the stories that you heard from your parents and grandparents.	2001-07-04

This story however, is told well without being strident and lecturing.<br />&quot;Peter's Place&quot; gives us an unashamedly powerful environmental message. Oil tankers that run aground can cause serious harm to the marine environment.<br />The power of Michael Foreman's illustrations, as in all good children's picture books, delivers at least fifty percent of the value. They portray the spectacular wild beauty of the Cornish (?) coastline.<br />The atmospherics are intense, focussing on the power of the sea. That line between the ocean and the land is a fragile interface. It is where the activities of man can have the most impact. The shipwreck of a tanker is the key event.<br />Young Peter loves his coast and the wildlife that lives there. His rescue of the oil-covered eider ducks is the most touching moment in the book.<br />The coast recovers and life goes on. The duck brings his family along to meet Peter. The survival instincts of nature triumph. Thankfully, doom-laden catastrophe scenarios, often portrayed by proselytizing eco-warriors, haven't overly influenced this book.<br />The most important message in the book is not the evils of oil tankers, but the tenacity of life.

They often seem so contrived and sometimes downright corny.<br />Not so in Alison Lester's &lt;&lt; Magic Beach &gt;&gt;. This book deserves the status of a classic in contemporary children's literature. In fact, the book is regularly listed in the Best Seller lists in Australia, where the author resides. ...<br />All children love the freedom and fun of a trip to the beach. Alison transports us to one of the childhood's favourite playground, that place where the land meets the sea. The real joys of beachside fun are joined with pleasurable and harmless seaside fantasies.<br />On alternate pages, we are taken from beautiful realities to even more captivating fantasies.  We go from a scene with a sparkling sea to an exciting world where we can ride waves pretending they are &quot;wild white horses&quot;.  We go from sandcastle building to a land of fire breathing dragons. We explore rock-pools and their magic world of starfish and crabs, and then go to an evenmore magic Kingdom where we can ride seahorses.<br />The beach is still magic when it's a cloudy and gray day, our imaginations will help us discovered a treasure chest. We can go boating in the safety of bay, and then let the wind and our fantasies take us to the &quot;edge of the world&quot;.<br />We fish and laze on the jetty, and in our daydreams, we catch a monstrous shark.<br />It is now evening-time, we are toasting marshmallows around the glowing fire, and in the shadows, there may be smugglers hauling in crate-loads of booty.<br />It's time for bed, and to the sounds of the ocean, we drift off to sleep on the evening tide.<br />This is a fabulous book which has universal and popular appeal.

Instead you'll get some hyped up, impressionistic flim flam hoping to move us, and entertain us with the exciting new world (as it was) of the Internet (circa mid 90s). The movers and fakers come straight from central casting.<br />The book floats along with Clark's cyber-yacht &quot;Hyperion&quot; as the centerpiece of the action. The fate of this boat, with its over-engineered, 25 SGI workstation driven technology was a disaster waiting to happen. Its bloated pretentiousness and lack of real connection with maritime fundamentals  (just forget about the weather) is a good allegory to what was going on in those 5 fantastic years that followed the Netscape IPO of 1995. Those investors who went along for the ride thought they had discovered the fail-proof money making machine.<br />Lewis as a writer and Clark as an engineer, turned billionaire and aspiring yachtsman, appear to know very little about the fundamentals of sailing. You can't cross the Atlantic Ocean &quot; in a straight line as quickly as possible&quot; as Clark commanded his skipper. ( p316). There are some basic elements such as winds, currents and the curvature of the earth to contend with.<br />There is no doubt that Clark is a driven man, unashamedly escaping his past. There is a strong element of psychobiography in this book. For Clark everything has to be new. The mystery of the old tarnished tuba from Clark's schooldays, which sits in a corner of Clark's guestroom, is one of the keys to the past that Lewis reveals to the reader.<br />The most worthwhile part of the book (p398) is when Lewis reflects &quot; Why do people perpetually create for themselves the condition for their own dissatisfaction?&quot;<br />On the following page, he observes &quot; People who are unhappy with theway things are, tend to remain unhappy even after they have changed them.&quot;  These are profound insights. It is a shame that Lewis distracts us with all the trivia in between.<br />This book confirms that the two high points of the Californian economic miracle (Silicon Valley and Hollywood), are both a product of a systemic frustration with the shortcomings of reality. What else do we need to drive our hoped-for progress as a civilization and at the same time &quot;enrich&quot; our popular culture? Materialism, whizz-bangery and vicarious thrill seeking fills the gap.<br />Those readers who have limited familiarity with the technology behind the Internet revolution, deserve more explanation of the significance of the key underpinning developments that were central to Clark's enterprises. Microsoft and the Browser Wars get a good run but surely the role of non-Windows operating systems such as UNIX warrant some passing comment in this book.<br />Lewis's writing style can be tiresome particularly his use of the F--- expletive on almost every page. Adding color to the dialog is one thing, and it may reflect the way some people talk, but it is more distracting than useful in a work of non-fiction like this.<br />The author evidently resides in Paris (France not Texas) these days. From that locale, you would think he would be less parochial when discussing the eating habits of non-Americans. He sneers at the cheese sandwiches the young Dutch investment analysts eat for breakfast, and what's worse, on two occasions when talking about the two smartest engineers on Clark's payroll (who just happen to come from India) he refers to the faint smell of curry which follows them around. This has more than a faint smell of racism about it. We are given a number of references to Filipino monkeys (seaman) just for good measure.<br />The climax of the book is when the Hyperion has engine failure in mid Atlantic. If this book is ever going to make it as a movie, it will need somegood continuity work. On page 345, with the yacht's motor stopped, the engineer goes down to the engine room --- &quot;It was hot. It was loud enough that Robert needed ear mufflers&quot;. Did he forget to turn the Hi Fi down?<br />With so much emphasis in this book on the ups and downs of stock prices, you would think the author and Clark would know when things were heading south. Most of the time they were at sea in the Hyperion no one knew the direction of the wind. The yacht with its over-reliance on technology is reminiscent of lots of bloat-ware that choke up our PCs. The Hyperion was lucky it didn't disappear into a fatal blue screen of oblivion.  <br />The most fascinating scene in the book is where Clark, only two days into the voyage across the Atlantic, becomes totally bored with his new toy boat. This says it all.<br />&quot;The New New Thing &quot; provides a valuable insight into one of the key personalities of the Internet market frenzy of the late 1990s. Unfortunately, since we all seem to be consumed these days by chasing newness, this book (and the lessons it teaches) will be totally forgotten in a few years time. Henry Ford would be at home in Silicon Valley today. History is still all bunkum when technological advancement, takes precedence over people or nature<br />For readers who want real insights on where the Web came from, the people who were responsible for it, and the business cultures that have emerged in its wake should read &quot;Architects of the Web&quot;, Robert H Reid's great book from 1997. &quot;The New New Thing&quot; in contrast looks like a tired relic from the last century only two years after publication.	2001-04-17

One with a pedigree&quot;.<br />Courtney is the least popular dog at the Dog's Home. Perversely, it was the children's' choice.<br />The parents reaction was &quot;What on earth have you got there&quot; .... He's a mongrel&quot;<br />Courtney turns out to be a real wonder-dog. He was a top chef, who could entertain the family with his violin playing and juggling, and in his spare time could do the house work and save baby from a house fire.<br />Is there some sort of class-consciousness here? Courtney is a great servant to the family, but he is very poorly bred and no doubt, poorly rewarded. There is no meritocracy in Courtney's world. When this marvellous dog decides to leave the family, all Dad could say, &quot;If they are not thoroughbreds you cannot rely on them.&quot;<br />The climax of the book is the great sea rescue, where the children are pulled to shore in their runaway rubber boat by some mysterious force. <br />&quot;I wonder what it could have been&quot;, is the lingering last line of the book.  We all know who it was. After all the insults from Dad, it was the last favour old Courtney was going to give that family.<br />Another strange book from John Burningham. It is illogical and confused. Ill considered messages are his trademark.<br />His illustrations are ink drawings, colored with blunt crayons and crudely applied watercolors. This naive style when done well can be effective.  In this case, the ink lines are hesitantly staccato, tracing still visible lead pencil sketching. Not a good look. Not a good book.	2001-03-26

This might have something to do with little person's low-eyelevel perspective.  Most young children play in a miniaturised world, Little boys with the toy cars and trains, or little girls with their baby dolls. Playing on the floor or out in the garden, small things look large, and big things look huge. <br />In this story, Grandma transports the children to a world where they live in a snail's shell house. They have three adventures. The great earthquake when the apple fell; baby gets lost when she climbs the dandelion; and the day the thrush almost got their snail but was scared away by a cat.<br />One of the charms of the book, is the way the children interrupt their Grandma as she tells the story, and ask questions and make suggestions. Does that sound familiar?<br />We are never that far from the real world. On each page, outside the frames that contain Grandma's story we see the children with their grandmother or shown scenes close by her house. We are reminded that traffic is humming on the distant road and &quot;headlights are gleaming in the gathering dark&quot;.<br />This is one of those rare picturebooks where the story and illustrations mesh perfectly. The story within the story is a neat device, perfectly matched and supported by the illustrations, which show both the &quot;real world&quot; at Grandma's house and the &quot;story book&quot; micro-world of the adventures with the snail.<br />Gillian Tyler's portrayal of the miniature scenes in the garden is superb. The details and activities going on beyond the written story will intrigue and capture the attention of all youngsters.<br />There is just a hint of mystery in the story. In the last scene, we see young Hannah out on the verandah  &quot;standingyet, gazing into the muffled blackness of the garden&quot;. <br />&quot;The Snail House&quot; shows us that gentle, lyrical writing, and charming and soft but detailed pictorials still have an important part to play in making a children's picture book work successfully. It is a refreshing change from a lot of the garishly, overly styled, supposedly smart and sometimes very cynical children's books that we often see.	2001-03-26

They are often seen as the epitome of high-order human endeavour. The astronaut explores outer space and the neuroscientist looks into the world of human inner space.<br />Antonio Damasio is a neurophysiologist who puts a great  emphasis on the hardware side of the human thinking process. His clinical studies often seem to revolve around cases where the patients have had some trauma or have had a part of the brain removed or modified. The conclusions drawn from this approach are reminiscent of the backyard TV repairman without a circuit diagram who starts pulling components off the circuit boards to see what happens.  NASA wouldn't try this method on the space shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;.<br />Damasio emphasises the architecture of the brain. Brain chemistry and the processes and controls at work are surely of equal or greater importance. As an example, we are given only a passing reference to the function of serotonin, which is now recognized as one on the key neurochemicals. Damasio dedicates a large part of his book to discussing the links between emotion, feelings and consciousness. His neglect of the reality that our physicians are prescribing huge amounts of psychotropic drugs for mood disorders is a yawning omission.<br />Damasio's previous book, &quot;Descarte's Error&quot; ran the argument that an emotional component is an important element in the reasoning process. In &quot;The Feeling of What Happens&quot; he goes one step further and builds a distinction between our emotions and our feelings and how they link to the state of human consciousness. He puts feelings above emotions on a hierarchical table of &quot;Levels of Life Regulation&quot;. (page 55). His attempts to define the difference between emotions and feelings become very tenuous. His arguments are often circular and fall into a morass of semantic subtleties. His acknowledgment at an early point in his book (p42) that emotions andfeelings may in fact be part of a continuum shows what follows,  is perhaps no more than a contrived argument to push some fanciful ideas.   Damasio's position that emotions and feelings are different beasts can lead to some strange conclusions. He tells us that emotions are more fundamental than feelings and they are typically induced. He sees external stimuli as the prime input to our emotional behaviour. Where does this leave mental states which have an almost certain endogenous cause and at the same time make billions for the pharmaceutical corporations?<br />Feelings, he tells us are things we internalize, whereas emotions are externalized. Damasio argues that emotions are public property and readily observable, but on the other hand our feelings are private and internalized. Something doesn't mesh here. Surely, things that are externalized are more readily controllable and capable of being masked. This goes contrary to his argument that emotions are inherent and therefore less malleable.<br />Damasio's definition of a mood is a sustained emotional state. We hear all the time about the great modern affliction of mood disorders. If we follow Damasio's line this pathology would be a prolonged, externalized emotion. When you consider the internalized, private world of feelings ( according to Damasio) surely our mental health practioners should be looking to diagnose &quot;feeling disorders&quot;. Now, they sound really painful and personal, but surely less embarassing and inconvenient to onlookers than mood disorders. <br />Another notable gap in Damasio's work is any detailed discussion of that greatest and least attainable emotion, happiness. Despite the advances of brain imaging technology and the widespread use of antidepressant and mood altering drugs,  there is no real roadmap out there showing us the way to a sadness free existence.<br />If you follow Damasio's classification, pleasure would be an emotion and happiness a feeling, but try telling that to a dog wagging his tail. Trying to bundle our emotional states into the same sort of pigeonholes  as bodily functions cannot work. Why is happiness such a transitory, difficult to attain state (particularly if you work on it too hard), but on the other side, why can sadness be such an insidious almost cancerous condition for some people?<br />Damasio is on the right path, however he needs to better integrate his work with the other great advances in understanding the human condition. His contrived classification of the most vicarious of our emotional states can only lead to a blind alley. Perhaps a solution is close at hand. Maybe recognition of the happiness gene is all that is required?	2001-03-20

The tension and suspense is fantastic as each creature in turn gets aboard. The donkey is a smart critter since he knew how to balance the weight of the cow.

It has an almost iconic status with people who grew up in the early Baby Boomer years. <br />Way back in 1946, toy stores were quiet uncrowded places. In one toy shop there was a rocking horse, a GI Joe Doll and a few cuddly soft toys ........ and one grumpy red painted tugboat called Scuffy.<br />Scuffy was ambitious. He thought he was meant for bigger things, than just sailing in a bathtub.<br />The toy shop owner (with his memorable polka dot tie) and his little boy, took Scuffy off to a laughing brook. It was springtime and the brook was running fast. Scuffy was soon off on his adventure.<br />The pastoral world he passed through seemed placid, but at night the hooting owl gave him a fright.<br />The river got bigger and busier. Scuffy was proud because he knew it was HIS river. He was nearly squashed between two logs that were on their way to the sawmill. With the spring melt a great flood burst the rivers banks. A lady and her cow had to be rescued off her roof.<br />Pushed along by the floodwaters Scuffy arrived in the big city. It was a very noisy and busy place. When Scuffy tooted nobody noticed.<br />Scuffy was just about to be swept out to sea. He wished the man with the polka dot tie and his little boy could rescue him. Miracle of miracles, there they were just as Scuffy was about to pass the last bit off land. He was rescued. <br />Scuffy realises that sailing in the bathtub is not such a bad thing ...... in fact he said &quot;this is the life for me&quot;.<br />The illustrations by Tibor Gergely are what make this book so appealing. The scenes are full of life and activity, be it the pastoral river scene with its friendly animals and the colourful towns and cities. Look for the details in the city scene. Try to find the horses. <br />Tibor Gergely was a great children's book illustrator from this period. In addition to his artwork in Scuffy you can enjoy his illustrations in those other &quot;Little Golden Book&quot; classics,  &quot;The Little Red Caboose&quot; and &quot;Tootle&quot;. These three books are perfect companions in any young person's library.	2001-02-05

Who wants to get out of bed? None of us do, least of all Mr Sun.<br />The snow is thick on the ground and the stars twinkle in the sky. Two wisps of smoke swirl skywards from the cottage chimney.<br />The story line from Nancy White Carlstrom is almost poetic. Take these lines as an example.<br />&quot;the house snores peacefully under the blanket,   of new snow&quot;.<br />&quot;snow, shining, silvery   the moon,  the moon - get the sun out of bed&quot;<br />The illustrations are perfect. We get views of this little world from all perspectives. From an aerial scene we see animal footprints leading to the door. A subtle humour pervades the illustrations. The quirky Alaskan origins of the story shine through.<br />We get a view from space. We see the large cratered moon in his last quarter. We see planet earth sleeping below, with the chimney smoke on the horizon. There is Mr Sun still asleep in his Four Poster bed under the covers.<br />Now we are taken inside the cottage and we see the warm glow of the fire and the hissing kettle. <br />Curled up in her basket beside the fire is the most beautiful, black rabbit. This bunny called Midnight is the little boy Nicholas' pet. Nicholas is fast asleep in a Four Poster bed just like Mr Sun's.<br />We are all asked to solve the riddle of who does wake up Mr Sun? One guess is that it was Mr Moon, for it was the moon &quot;who nudged awake Midnight&quot;. It was Midnight who nuzzled Nicholas awake, and together they both stood at the window and greeted the dawn.<br />There is only one minor criticism of the book. It shows the sun rising while the moon is setting. This only happens around when the moon is full, yet in this book the moon is only a quarter full.<br />In summary this is a fabulous book. Lobby the publishers and get it back into print. The best editions are printed in Italy where it seems some of the classier children's books get printed. The vivacity and warmth of the colours is a trademark of Italian printeries.	2001-02-05

A child's world was uncomplicated and full of innocence.<br />The story could not be simpler. The caboose always came last. He was sad because the loco and the wagons got all the waves from the children. He thought, &quot;nobody cares for me&quot;.<br />However, one day, the train was so heavily loaded that it started to slip backwards when going up a tall mountain. The caboose slammed on his brakes and kept the train from sliding backwards. He saves the train.<br />The illustrations by Tibor Gergely are what make this book so appealing. The scenes are full of life and activity, be it the forests with its friendly animals and the colourful towns, farms with lots of happy people.<br />Everybody loves the era of steam trains with their solid, comforting dependability. Go back and revisit the world of &quot;The Little Red Caboose&quot;. There were still some horses and buggies on the roads back then, but there is a portent of the busier modern world soon to come. In one scene we see an airliner in the sky.<br />Tibor Gergely was a great children's book illustrator from this period. In addition to his artwork in the Caboose you can enjoy his illustrations in those other &quot;Little Golden Book&quot; classics,  &quot;Scuffy the Tugboat&quot; and &quot;Tootle&quot;. These three books are perfect companions in any young person's library.	2001-02-05

In his latest flight manual he sets out to convince us that everything on planet earth is an inter-connected, consciously aware, intelligent machine.<br />Like so much writing done on the fringes of the social sciences his ramblings get dangerously close to the murky world of pseudo-science.<br />In order to give his &quot;opus&quot; an allure of credibility and robustness the book is well endowed with footnotes and a bibliography. In fact they take up 150 pages of this 370-page book. It's a shame that he does not check the veracity of his citations. On page 59 we have the &quot;in the wild&quot; aggression of chimpanzees throwing stones at tigers. It's a shame that tigers are only found in Asia and chimps are restricted to Africa. That chimp had a strong arm!  It's this sort of sloppiness that gives the behavioural sciences a bad name. The recent imbroglio over the anthropological studies of the Yanomamo Indians in the Amazon jungle is a product of such ill-disciplined research.<br />Bloom's book claims to cover the &quot;Evolution of the Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century&quot;. We are given endless details on the sex-life of Archaeozoic primitive life forms and gory descriptions of pornographic Neolithic cave paintings (p103 -104). The flowering of western civilization in the past 500 years with the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and the last 150 years of technology development is dismissed in a few flimsy chapters.  Surely if there is a Global Brain emerging the best evidence would be seen in the work of Galileo, Newton and Einstein. Our Italian seer is dismissed by Bloom in a few lines as an improver of telescopes, whereas Isaac and Albert don't rate a mention in his book at all.<br />Bloom seems to endorse the mentality of the mob. He gives himself away when describing the maverick ants (p38) who go hunting for new food sources away from the colony. Bloom says they merely  &quot;stumble&quot; on food, they don't explore systematically or work rationally towards their discoveries.  This behaviour which can result in saving the colony from starvation is done by individual trailblazers, not by the &quot;mass mind&quot; of the collective machine.<br />Bloom weaves his way on a convolute voyage along the paths already well worn by followers of Darwin, Marx and Freud. Despite his many tenuous arguments and his histrionic style Bloom may just be right after all. The real test will be when the Global Brain takes up chess.	2001-02-03

We see a spirit of adventure and at times there is mischievous fun to be had.<br />When two children have names like Wild and Woolly (we suspect brother and sister) we can anticipate something out of the ordinary will happen.<br />Every child's fantasy is realized when they dig a hole in their sandpit and fall through it to the North Pole. Their dog (who remains nameless) comes along too.<br />We all know who lives at the North Pole and it just happens to be Christmas. Turkey and Christmas Pudding are on the menu. They enjoy the feast and its time for bed,<br />The next day they continue their trek. They visit all the famous fairy tale characters and at each of their houses they are welcomed with generous hospitality, and given a magnificent feast.<br />Each day they arrive at a new place. Their itinerary (and menu) included angel cakes and sugar kisses at the Good Fairy's, royal trifle and rhubarb fool at Prince Charming's, sea-grapes at the Little Mermaid's, salami sausage and pickled cucumbers at the Pirate King's and goulash and dumplings at the Gipsy Queen's.<br />After all these feasts they eventually find their way home.

A little boy is playing with his toy water wheel.<br />We learn about the trees that grow along the riverbank and the roles they play.

Turn the transparent page and the eggs are hatching with the chicks heading towards the water.<br />Now the kingfisher is diving for a fish into the river. Turn the page and he's caught a minnow.

Abel has to leave his family and travel to find work. They are not a prosperous family, the front gate squeaks and the garden is overgrown. There is no TV or video games in this house. Instead they sit around the fire and tell stories. Somehow they look happy!<br />There are 3 children Adam, Noah and baby Ben, and of course Skipper the dog. The boys know how to entertain themselves, such as playing at being wild animals. Mabel and Ben love dancing to the music on the radio. When Abel is back home he tries to write up the stories of his travels but the noise from the family is too much. He has to go out into the garden to get some peace and quiet in order to work.<br />Abel's stories about his adventures are full of tales about monkey's swinging through trees, crocodiles in muddy swamps and travelling on riverboats to remote places.<br />Once again it was time for Abel to set out to find work. The boys missed their Dad very much.<br />The boys turn the old writing table that Dad had used out in the garden into a camp. They are sure they can hear monkeys in the trees.  They then turn the table upside down to make a pretend boat.  They paddled it through muddy crocodile infested swamps with only the moon to guide them.<br />Adam one day decided that the writing table could be turned into a moon machine with the addition of few planks of wood to make some propellers. Under the light of the full moon Adam looked out at the moon machine in his garden.<br />Adam had a remarkable and profound thought. &quot; He knew that the moon was shining down on him, and Abel too. It shone down on all the people who loved each other and couldn't always be together, beaming down on each and every one, no matter how far away they were&quot;.<br />With his strong sense of imagination Adam planned that one night soon, he and Noah (and Skipper if he behaved himself) would take off in the moon machine, and drop in on Dad, wherever he was. <br />Soon Abel would be back home with his family. The boys would then tell Abel all about THEIR adventures.<br />You get the message that Abel's sons have just as strong sense of imagination as their father does. You guess his crocodile stories may be just as real as Adam's trips in his moon machine. <br />&quot;Abel's Moon&quot; is a delightful story. The illustrations capture the era and the atmosphere perfectly.	2001-01-30

Auberon and his father Evelyn were masters of the English language. Together they perfected the use of ironic wit.<br />&quot;Will this Do?&quot; is much more than an autobiography.  It is an encapsulation of an era and a culture. His work covers that incredible period of British history (1960 - 1980) where the &quot;old order&quot; Establishment, with its upper class &quot;born to rule&quot; social structures were overthrown.<br />In that period political satire became part of popular culture. Witness the rise of &quot;smart&quot; young men like David Frost and the circle of comedians that arose from the Cambridge Footlights. The weekly newspaper &quot;Private Eye&quot; was one of the most influential outlets for Auberon Waugh where he wrote a column for many years. The &quot;Eye&quot; did more for exposing political and social scandal in Britain than any other forum.<br />Waugh's membership of both the &quot;upper&quot; class and influential, activist intellectual circles put he him in a unique position to observe and comment on the quirks and absurdities of his Britain.<br />Occasionally he was overtly a political activist.  The most prominent example was his very public support of the Biafran cause in the Nigerian Civil War in the early 1970s. This put him at loggerheads with the British government.<br />In Waugh's biography his ironic tone is pervasive. Even those readers who know his work well, will at times struggle to figure out whether he is joking, serious or merely &quot;going over the top&quot;.<br />Auberon's humour didn't travel too well across the Atlantic. He found American's far &quot;too earnest&quot;, who take his words too literally. However the gulf in styles of humour between the Anglo and the American world must have been closed to some degree thanks to Waugh's writing.<br />Waugh's influence on the world of wine was huge. For many years he wrote a wine column in the English &quot;Spectator&quot;. In the early 1980's he &quot;discovered&quot; New World (Australian and Californian) wine. Although the Spectator at that time had a subscription base of only 14,000, it was hugely influential. The cellars of the House of Lords were probably restocked on the advice of Waugh. When you look at the exponential growth of New World wine exports since that time we may have a perfect example of viral marketing, thanks to one man's words in an obscure journal.<br />Many people who are not familiar with the style and wit of Waugh may find his writing pompous and haughty. It is well worth persisting though. He was probably the first writer to do a demolition job on Political Correctness. His favourite targets were the self-righteous. If they happened to be humourless as well (a strong correlation?) they would get both barrels from Waugh.<br />The influence of both Evelyn and Auberon Waugh will be felt for many years. Any body who loves the English language should read Auberon's autobiography. His work is the ideal example of that old aphorism &quot; The Pen is Mightier than the Sword&quot;.glish &quot;Spectator&quot;. In the early 1980's he &quot;discovered&quot; New World (Australian and Californian) wine. Although the Spectator at that time had a subscription base of only 14,000, it was hugely influential.

This is a great name for a green python, especially one with musical talent who could tap a tune with his tail.<br />Verdi was a thoughtful little snake. He went off to seek some wisdom from the older snakes.<br />The first python he spoke to was Umbles and he was a grumbler. Ribbon was a complainer and Aggie didn't like being stared at. They were so boring thought Verdi. After speaking to Dozer he concluded old green pythons were lazy, boring and rude.<br />He wanted to stay yellow forever, but one day he noticed that he was starting to turn green. Verdi headed to the river, to scrub himself but a big fish almost took him. He got covered in mud and when that dried and fell off he was greener still.<br />Undaunted, Verdi climbed to the top of a tall tree towards the golden sun which he thought would make him yellow again. He startled a flock of colorful birds (Australian Rainbow Lorikeets) and then fell back to earth.<br />Verdi hurt himself badly, and the old green pythons had to nurse him back to health. He listened to the snakes tell stories of when they were young and adventurous. Now they preferred the quiet life.<br />One night when Verdi was well again he listened to the forest come alive with nocturnal activity. Under the light of the full moon Verdi could see the beautiful white CusCus and that wonder of the bird world, the Tawny Frogmouth.<br />For the first time Verdi noticed the passage of time with the waxing and waning of the moon. Our friend might just be slowing down.<br />He was now so green he blended perfectly with the leaves. Life has now turned full circle and two young yellow pythons start mocking Verdi for being old and slow.<br />But Verdi was still Verdi and he showed the young ones how to do a perfect Figure Eight.<br />Verdi is a magnificent book. The bright luminous illustrations match the breezy and witty story line. This is a great tale on the trials and pitfalls when we slither, swing and occasionally slip and fall alongthat pathway from youth to maturity.<br />At the back of the book there are some &quot;Snake Notes&quot; which gives some useful zoological details on snakes,  and pythons in particular.<br />This book appeals on many levels. It is visually very attractive, the story line is amusing and there is an educational element that will expose young people to the marvels of the snake world and no doubt encourage further interest.<br />It is refreshing to see snakes portrayed as frolicking fun lovers, rather than the traditional sinister stereotype we normally see.	2001-01-25

The patch on the eye and the parrot on the shoulder are all part of the game.<br />The hero of our story has an older brother called Peter who's got a pirate suit. Of course Peter has all the fun, gets all the treasure and makes our little friend walk the plank when in a sea of crocodiles.<br />When the boys grow up a little our friend inherits the pirate suit. However he doesn't get to experience the pleasures of being a pirate since Peter is now a lion tamer. Now, guess who is the lion? It looks like young brother is about to get his revenge.<br />Lobby the publisher to get this fun book back in print.	2001-01-19

He is the smart hero in this classic story.<br />The real lesson in this tale is shown in the fate of the tigers. Their greed and arrogance leads to an argument over &quot;who is the grandest&quot; when dressed in Sambo's clothes. They get so angry with each other that they forget why they are fighting but just go on getting angrier until they chase each other into oblivion. We see avarice, leading to pride, aggression, and ultimately to destruction.  This is a profound lesson for all of us.<br />The big jar of melted butter (ex-tiger) that Sambo's dad collected from under the palm tree let Mom cook up a big pile of pancakes to feed all the family. <br />The only criticism that can be levelled at this book is &quot;tigerism&quot;.<br /> Make sure you get a genuine re-issue of Miss Bannerman's 1921 original classic not one of the bowdlerized (and supposedly sanitized) &quot;updates&quot;. The 21 illustrations in the original have a delightfully naïve quality and form an essential part of this book. Look out for other books in the &quot; Wee Books for Wee Folk&quot; series.

We also see inside the hermit crab's shell and the time he does his house-moving!<br />If you love to eat shell-fish, you will adore the pictures of the oysters, mussels and scallops. By turning the page you see inside the shell. They look good enough to eat. By the way, why do so many chefs discard those gorgeous roes on scallops?<br />The scene of the wading birds (curlews and oystercatchers) is done particularly well, We get an &quot;underground view&quot; of the burrowing molluscs and the long curving beaks of the birds at the surface hunting for their supper.<br />The illustrator's art is at its most brilliant when we are looking at a curtain of brilliantly colored seagrasses. There is something lurking behind here. Turn the page and you are face to face with a moray eel.<br />Track this book down or lobby the publishers to re-print it.

A dictionary like the OED has its real power and value in its use as an etymological tool. It's the origin of words and where they were first used that gives us a fundamental understanding of our language.<br />For lovers of Shakespeare there are references to words first appearing in his works on almost every page of the OED. A great on-line project would be to hyperlink a &quot;Complete Works&quot; of the Bard to the OED with all the non-common words he uses.<br />One word of warning to book lovers and potential owners of the OED ---- Make sure your four feet of shelf space is well shielded from direct sunlight.  Those gorgeous royal blue fly-covers will fade very quickly if over exposed to UV.<br />If you were given the choice of what books you could take to that hypothetical desert island, the OED would have to be the linguaphiles choice. It is the perfect encapsulation and guide to what our language and culture is all about.<br />As a footnote you have to admire that quirky but subtle British humour that shines through even in the serious world of dictionary publishing. Check out the spines of Volumes VII and XVII where they are indexed with the first and last word in each volume. <br />In Volume VII we have &quot; Hat  -- Intervacuum &quot;.  Is the OED subtly telling us what lurks under a Stetson?  Volume XVI is indexed from &quot; Soot -- Styx'. Is this evidence that there is a hot and smoky welcome on the other side of that river between here and hell?	2001-01-07

This sets the tone for the rest of the book. Pure flim flam.<br />The  Bodanis approach includes giving us salacious details on the love life of Voltaire's mistress. His dumbing down of basic chemistry includes a description of Lavoisier's oxidation experiments as &quot;some of the gases must have flown down and stuck to the metal&quot;.<br />With the speed of light as the critical element to his story he persists throughout the book in giving its speed in miles per hour (670 million).  To impress us he squares it and gives us all the zeroes. Wouldn't he be doing everybody a favour if he introduced scientific notation and even occasionally referred to the International System for units of measurement? After all, those French guys 220 years ago did come up with metres and kilograms, without which modern science would be impossible. Those relationships between mass, time and energy (which is what this book is meant to be all about) are unlikely to have been realized without the introduction of the metric system.<br />His description of radioactivity is almost comic when we have radiation &quot;squirting out&quot; of Marie Curie's uranium ores. We are told poor Marie's fate was sealed when &quot;radioactive dust slams into the DNA of her bones&quot;. We are given no mention of her inhaling all the radon gas emanating from that radium she so famously discovered. It is the effects of this radon that is now generally acknowledged as the most probable cause of her death.<br />In many places in the book he confuses nuclear fission and fusion, at one point drawing similarities between the processes at work in a star and what makes a uranium bomb work. For example, he writes &quot;our sun explodes the equivalent of many millions of such bombs every second&quot;<br />The most fundamental fallacy in the book is theway Bodanis links directly Einstein's equation of 1905 and the unleashing of man-made nuclear energy in the early 1940's. The Special Theory of Relativity of which the famous equation is central had nothing to do with the development of the A-Bomb. The essence of Einstein's argument (and equation) is that energy has inertia, and inertia has energy. There was no reference in his work as to how the energy may be released; yet Bodanis persists in referring to &quot;the full power of Einstein's equation&quot; when he talks about the events of 1905.<br />Glaring contradictions are found throughout the book. On page 169 Bodanis writes &quot; when that great mushroom cloud appeared E=mc^2's first work on planet Earth was done&quot;. A chapter or so later when talking about natural process at work within the earth he gives us &quot; Volcanoes exploded upward - powered by the constant E=mc^2 derived heat beneath&quot;.<br />The sad irony of this book is seeing a significant topic dealt with in such a lightweight manner. Worthwhile (and readable) science books for general audiences do exist.  The superficial, error-ridden and vacuous crassitude of this book is most disappointing.	2001-01-03

Such a simple story: - a white dog with black spots becomes a black dog with white spots after a day's romp, followed by a temporary identity crisis.<br />Harry is one of those children's books where the story and the pictures mesh perfectly. The home-life and street scenes that Harry experiences are straight form the wholesome 1950's. Springtime daffodils are everywhere. In fact the green and golden colors are the only two colors that were on the illustrators palette. The pictures by Margaret Bloy Graham are at least half the charm of the book.<br />The drawings of Harry's family, their house and neighbourhood couldn't be simpler. The magic of this drawing style shines through when you see how she has captured the smiles and gasps on their faces.<br />All dog lovers know how dogs can smile. After Harry's homecoming, his bath (and hard scrub), and dinner we see Harry with the biggest doggy smile, you have ever seen. <br />This book will sure to be around and enjoyed by children for another 50 years.	2001-01-02

Their almost human expressions seem to tell us that they are something special.<br />The three little owls in &quot;Owl Babies&quot; are certainly intelligent creatures. They soon realise when Owl Mother has gone she must be off hunting for food. Big sister Sarah keeps their morale high when doubts arise about their mother's safety. Little Bill can only say, &quot;I want my mummy&quot;.<br />When they begin to fear the worst (foxes loom large in their imagination) they close their eyes and wish Owl Mother would come home. Their faith is rewarded for soon &quot; softly and silently she swooped through the trees to Sarah, Percy and Bill&quot;. Isn't that great alliteration and imagery?<br />The pictures that accompany the story focus on the expressions of the three owl babies. Since it is night time we don't see much beyond the safety of their tree. The pen-and-ink drawings of our feathered friends are superb. Those droopy little pink beaks and big brown eyes have a strong plaintive appeal.<br />&quot;Owl Babies&quot; will be a rewarding book for all readers. The strong two-way bond between parents and children could not be better expressed.<br />.	2000-12-18

One night the patch of ice, on which he sleeps, breaks away and he starts drifting south on the ocean. Luckily Lars finds a barrel on which to float and after a long time he finds himself on a tropical beach. In this new land everything is green when compared to the whiteness of  the North Pole.<br />Lars meets Henry the hippo and they soon become good friends. Despite the wonders of this new land Lars becomes homesick and wants to find his way back home. Henry suggests Marcus the eagle could help since he has travelled all over the world. Marcus arranges for Samson the whale to take Lars back to the North Pole.<br />Riding on Samson's back across the oceans Lars eventually is reunited with his father, who is so pleased to see Lars, he catches Samson a nice big fish.<br />This is a delightful story and is universally acclaimed as a Classic having been published in many languages. The Swiss author Hans De Beer has done both the story and the superb illustrations. The English translation is by Rosemary Lanning. The clarity and crisp attractive style of this book perhaps reflects its Swiss origins.<br />There is a subtle message to the young readers of this book. The contrast between the all white world of the North Pole and the colorful Tropics could not be stronger. It will give children an awareness and appreciation of the diversities we experience when we travel.  <br />.	2000-12-14

It is in part inspired by Jan's earlier success with &quot;The Mitten&quot;.  We see Hedgie the hedgehog getting his nose stuck inside a woollen sock.<br />The beauty of the book is in the clever use of the double page format of the illustrations. We have a large central panel, which is almost like a window, where we see most of the activity. Along the top of the page we have a long narrow panel which shows the clothesline, with the items gradually disappearing as they are borrowed by the animals. On the left side we have an oval &quot;mirror&quot; which shows young Lisa (the owner of the hat and other clothes on the line) going about her household chores. <br />In the right panel we have another small oval pane, which tells us who is coming next. We get to see the succession of animals (hedgehog, hen, goose, cat, dog, pig, and horse) each eventually wearing an item of clothing they have stolen off the line. We don't see what the animals have done in the main frame until the end of the book. It's one of those picture books that you can go back to many times to pick up the various clues. <br />The use of the four windows on each double page gives an almost split-screen cinematic quality to the book. We get a multi-threaded and linked  storyline which any web oriented reader would appreciate. This innovative approach works very well and we can expect to see more picture books pick up on this story telling technique. <br />The illustrations are enhanced by the use of warm bright colors within the winter greys, from the Danish flag flying on the thatched farmhouse, to the red colors of Lisa's clothes, to the vivacity of the  farm animals. The accuracy and beauty of the drawings is outstanding. The keen observer will even see moss and lichen growing on the north side of the trees. We know this because we can see the dim winter sunshine on the southern skyline when looking through the forest.<br />&quot;The Hat&quot; has to be one of the classiest children's picture books published in recent years. It will bring great joy to both children and their parents.<br />.	2000-12-14

Instead, she lets her beautiful artwork do most of the talking.<br />In &quot;The Story of Rosy Dock&quot; our focus is drawn to the harsh beauty of the Australian desert.  The vivid desert red ochre colors shine out from every page. The level of realism that Jeannie has achieved in her collages tease the eye, with many quirky little details which are almost hiding in the huge landscapes. <br />The highlight of the story is a time when the dryness and harshness of the desert is inundated with rare flooding rains.<br />The human dimension is sensitively handled, where we see the elderly widow rescued from her little shack, when the floodwaters almost cover its roof. There is humour as well, where we see the widow's armchair high up in a dead tree when the floodwaters subside.<br />The sight of a small group of kangaroos and camels marooned on an island of high ground is touching. We see the spectacle of hundreds of pelicans coming up from the coast, seeking out the lakes created by the retreating floodwaters.<br />The environmental message comes through when we recognize the impact of the plagues of rabbits that burrow away in the sandy soil of the desert. The key to the story is the Rosy Dock plant, which was innocently planted by the widow in her precious little garden.  This escapes and is propagated all over the countryside. The damaging impact of non-indigenous fauna and flora is a particularly severe problem in Australia.<br />The negative environmental impact of the Rosy Dock is clearly explained in an &quot;afterword&quot; by the author at the back of the book. In brief, it is the power of these introduced species to &quot;change whole landscapes and push many (endemic) plants and animals to extinction&quot;.<br />.	2000-12-13

It is a tale of a young girl (almost certainly Jeannie) visiting her grandmother's house.<br />The story couldn't be simpler, but it is delightfully charming. The real beauty of Jeannie Baker's books is her amazing ability to create the very life-like collages that illustrate her pages.<br />Grandmother's house is almost hidden behind a wildly overgrown garden. The subtle message is that because of her age (and widowhood?) the garden has got away from her. The architectural detail of the house is magnificent, with filigreed iron lace work on the exterior and a superb carved mantle around the fireplace.<br />You suspect Jeannie's artistic talents must have been inherited from her grandmother for in the garden are carved stone figures that she said she carved long ago.<br />We share the simple joys of sitting with grandmother in front of the fire drinking tea and eating chocolate cake, and helping to knit a scarf of rainbow colors.<br />For those readers who know Jeannie's later works it is interesting to see how her style and technique have evolved since 1978. These days her work has a much stronger environmental message such as seen in &quot;Where the Forest Meets the Sea&quot;. Her collage methods of illustration have become increasingly sophisticated, but the very domestic scenes and sentimental story line seen in &quot;Grandmother&quot; is genuinely appealing.<br />Hopefully we will soon see this book back in print.<br />.	2000-12-13

You have to guess what is next on the menu. You only get to see part of the fruit or vegetables and a few descriptive adjectives, before you turn the page and get the answer. Then you see our little friend chomping his way through his feast.<br />He works his way through turnips, carrots, corn, peas, berries, grapes, apples and watermelon. The more he eats the bigger mess he makes. There are spills all over the table cloth and all over himself.<br />After all that food it's time for a nap. He leaves a technicolor trail of debris on the way back  to his hole.<br />A little while later, that nose emerges from the hole again &quot;SNIFF, SNIFF&quot;. It's dinnertime!   A funny thing has happened.  All the mess is cleaned up and no doubt the table has been restocked with goodies. Kids really love these circular stories.<br />The funniest part of the book is found on the very back page.

Books	5	11	11	N	N	MOTHERLY LOVE ----- TWELVE TIMES OVER	.<br />Some readers (particularly adults) may find this recent book by the venerable Eric Carle a little bit on the repetitive side or even short of plot. However the target audience for this book (2 to 4 YO's) are expert practitioners in the art of the repeated question .... with slight variations of course.<br />This book will appeal to the instinctive nature of young children to want to learn by covering the same ground (with slight variations of course) by going over a topic again and again (and again!)<br />The success of this book, shows the value of well structured rote learning. When done in an appealing way, like Mr Carle does, it is totally natural. The dynamic links between each question, page and animal will draw children along. The reward at the end of the book is the assurance that &quot;animal mothers love their babies just as yours loves you&quot;.<br />If you find yourself saying to your kids &quot;how many times do I have to tell you&quot; then perhaps spending some time with this book may be just as instructive to you  as it is to the children.<br />This book compares well with &quot;The Hungry Caterpillar&quot; where we learnt about numbers and time and tummy aches! In the &quot;Does a Kangaroo..&quot; we learn the importance of the loving relationships between parents and their offspring (BOING.... BOING) <br />Another great book by Eric Carle.

With the increasing ascendancy of the New World wine makers and in particular the influence of the Davis campus of the University of California, viticulture and oenology are now rigorous, scientific and commercially oriented professions. This is reflected in the &quot;Oxford Companion to Wine&quot; which has to be the most comprehensive, authoritative and accessible resource dealing with all aspects of the world of wine.<br />Jancis Robinson who edited this encyclopedia of wine is a highly respected wine writer and educator. She is also very well credentialled, holding the prestigious title of  &quot;Master of Wine&quot;. <br />The real power of this book as an information source is the very effective use of cross-references. Its great fun to see how far one reference will take you on subjects of particular interest to the reader. It would be good to see this book published as a CD-ROM. Hyper-linking all the cross-references would make it even more powerful.<br />The changes in the wine business over the past generation have seen the previously exclusive, &quot;clubbiness&quot;, almost snobby world of fine wine appreciation opened up to everyone. It is books like this that have provided the sources of knowledge which give people the confidence and curiosity to pursue their interest and enjoyment of wine.<br />France is the traditional home of fine wine. The French approach to wine making is still dominated by practices and methodologies that go back centuries. It is interesting to see in the &quot;Oxford Companion&quot; the strong contrast between the empirically rigorous New World (particularly USA and Australian) methods and the mystery (or mystique) that even today, shrouds much of the French industry.<br />One of the best illustrations of this dichotomy in the Companion is the entry on &quot;Terroir&quot;. This French term encapsulates the mystique that defines a particular vine growing area. It goeswell beyond the issue of soil and microclimate but instead embraces everything that makes a particular wine unique.<br />In the &quot;Companion&quot; the terroir debate seems to come down on the side which believes the term is used to cover vagueness and explain characteristics that are otherwise difficult to explain. This allows sometimes ordinary wine to be passed off as something special. <br />Compare this to the innovative, scientifically supported approaches used in the New World. A good example is the development of &quot;Canopy Management&quot; the varying techniques used to optimize the yield and ripening characteristics of a grapevine.<br />Similarly we have see the arrival of &quot;flying winemakers&quot; from Australia into regions like the Languedoc-Roussillon area of France. They have introduced stainless steel fermentation vessels, temperature control and meticulous cleanliness, to what was previously a very rough and ready local business. They are now producing some of the some best Merlots, acknowledged by even the French.<br />This book will no doubt become the definitive reference book on all matters to do with the world of wine. It will be of the highest value to both the wine professional and the enthusiastic wine lover.<br />.	2000-12-12

You will have to be in good voice since many of the characters often burst into song. Can a Broadway musical be far away?<br />The illustrations are also by the book's author Norman Lindsay, one of Australia's greatest artists of the early 20th century. Each page is graced with his masterful charcoal drawings humorously depicting the action. The pictures perfectly depict the quirky and amusing antics of the &quot;Magic Pudding&quot; characters.<br />Some young readers may find the language a little difficult. It's a combination of high Edwardian with sometimes archaic (but very colorful) slang. However it's the hilarious imagery, both written and pictorial, which will captivate children's attention.<br />Some of the language is almost Shakespearian but it's worth persisting.  Take for example Bunyip Bluegum's burst of oratory..... &quot; Base, indeed, must be the scoundrels, who, lost to all sense of decency and honour, boldly assume the outward semblance of worthy citizens&quot;.<br />Lindsay's writing includes some beautiful political social satire with observations like ... &quot;you only have to wear a top hat to be a respected pillar of society&quot;.<br />No doubt the animated movie version of &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot; will introduce a new generation to this classic story. Hopefully many of the children (and their parents) will be encouraged to read and enjoy Norman Lindsay's original.<br />.	2000-12-11

There were 245 titles on Amazon's database at last count.<br />This story of our blue bell bonneted buddy is Part 12 of the &quot;All Aboard for Toyland &quot; series. Some romance comes into young Nod's life in the form of Tessie Bear. They get quite seriously involved, particularly when they lose Farmer Straw's milk-churn and basket of eggs, which was tied to Noddy's new kite which lifted the milk and egg up into the sky, while Tessie tries to get the hens back into the hen-run after she left the gate open. Got all that? <br />If they get caught, Noddy volunteers to take Tessie's share of the spanking. Tessie says &quot;You're so nice and I do like you so much&quot;.  <br />Enid was obviously such a high-flying authoress back in the 1950's she was apparently immune from the rigour of the editor's blue pencil.<br />A bad blooper occurs in the continuity of the story between page 46 and 47. On page 46 we have &quot;..... the milk-churn wasn't up in the sky any longer. The string had broken and the churn had fallen down....&quot;. On the following page we have &quot;.... Tessie kept her eye on the swing milk-churn high up in the sky..... &quot;Noddy, Noddy - the churn's falling down, it's falling!&quot; Woops!<br />You can't deny these stories are classics. The language and the sentiment in these tales is very Edwardian, that is, very stern and stilted. There is always a moral to the story, typically revolving around the virtues of charity.<br />Fiona Cummings has rewritten this series of books in recent times, under the Enid Blyton trademark. They have been greatly abridged with the illustrations more cartoon like.<br />Despite the quaintness, the unintended humour and sloppy editing, the originals by Dame Enid herself are the best choice.

It's good to see that it is still in print.<br />&quot;Where The Forest Meets the Sea&quot; is truly a work of art. It is an ideal companion to her most recent work &quot;The Hidden Forest&quot;. It is fascinating to see how her style and technique has evolved and become increasingly sophisticated over the past 12 years.<br />Jeannie has an unashamedly environmental message to deliver, with her simple story lines dealing with the fragility of very special, ecologically unique areas. She doesn't push too hard with the rhetoric but lets her beautiful, ultra-lifelike, 3 dimensional images provide the perfect supporting context.<br />Having recently seen an exhibition of Jeannie's work that provided the images for &quot;Hidden Forest&quot; it is clear that it is the visual power of the images that is the most effective means of convincing people of the value of a particular environment.<br />In the dark forest scenes there are hidden dinosaurs and aboriginal figures providing a mystical quality to the book. The message that comes through is the timelessness of the natural environment.  <br />We are reminded at the end of the book of the potential for man to radically change the environment for the worse. It takes books like this to provide us with insights and observations that will prevent this from happening.<br />.	2000-12-07

Of course they thought he was talking about dragonflies.<br />Pooh became convinced that dragons were very real. That night he was very concerned that the dragon would come and steal his honey.<br />Next day Pooh and Piglet made a net to catch the Dragon. They went down to the stream, but all they managed to catch was Tigger.<br />Then a dragonfly appears and Pooh realizes his mistake.<br />Another fun day in the 100 Acre Wood.<br />.	2000-12-07

The author is in fact Fiona Cummings who was commissioned to write another series of Noddy Stories under the Enid Blyton trademark. Dame Enid gets full credit on the cover and title page but you have to look on the publisher's details page (ISBN etc) to see that the story is in fact by Fiona Cummings. <br />The story is written 40 years after the classic 24 title Noddy Series &quot;All Aboard for Toy Land&quot;.  A good example of the original is &quot;Noddy and Tessie Bear&quot; The fate of the new generation &quot;Mr Plod and the Stolen Bicycle&quot; is very similar to what has happened to Pooh Bear and Tigger in recent years. We have gone from the quaint Edwardian language of the original to the uncomplicated, perhaps, trivialized language of the contemporary versions.<br />We have lost all of the &quot;Englishness&quot; of the original.  Strange vocabulary and sentence structures could be off-putting to children used to a cartoon/comic dominated diet. Old fashioned concepts such as manners, politeness and deference have been expunged.<br />The illustrations have also been sanitized. Compared to the pictures in the original series they have lost their bright hard edges and have drifted into a more pastelly palette.<br />Although the original series of Noddy could be heavy going for some of today's young readers, we have seen how JK Rowling has demonstrated that the reading appetites of young readers can include sophisticated content. <br />Look out for the &quot;Noddy Classic Library&quot; and avoid the &quot;Toy Town Stories&quot;, As bedtime stories go,  the Classic Noddy will give you a 30-minute passage to dreamland. In contrast the modern versions like &quot;Mr Plod and the Stolen Bicycle&quot; would be lucky to give you 3 minutes of story. What child would be satisfied with that? <br />.	2000-12-07

All our favourite animals are here. <br />1 elephant, 2 giraffes, 3 gazelles, 4 hippos, 5 lion cubs, 6 zebras, 7 parrots, 8 crocodiles, 9 chimpanzees and 10 snakes.<br />A really clever feature is the index tabs around the top and side of the book. There are ten tabs, each with a picture of a jungle animal. From the front cover you see one tab for each animal but as you open it up, page by page, the tabs get larger and larger, accommodating the number of animals in each scene. Of course on the last page we have ten snakes around the scene.<br />A great way to get the young ones confidently counting up to 10.<br />.	2000-12-07

It gives us a portrayal of the lives of bears in the wild. It takes us into the real world, well beyond the saccharine confines inhabited by the average Teddy B.<br />All &quot;First Discovery&quot; series of children's books have transparent pages as their key feature. Every page is a treat. We see mother bear in her den, and when you turn the page you see her view of the wintry world outside. We see the polar bear with his nose down a hole in the ice. Turn the page and you can see him catching a seal.<br />Everybody loves Panda's. In this book you'll see mother Panda on one page, and when you turn the clear overlay, there is the cub suckling from mom. This is a gentle way for children to pick up some facts of life.<br />Hopefully this book will still be back in print. It certainly deserves to find a wider audience.	2000-12-06

The tempo and rhythm can't fail to grab a child's attention.<br />It's got the perfect mix of pace, suspense and humour.<br />A really neat touch from the illustrator (Helen Oxenbury) is the alternation between color and black and white pages.  The monochrome pages coincide with the recognition of the various obstacles along the way. <br />Another attractive effect is the way the early pages are bright and colorful and as the family gets closer to the bear, the scenes become darker and gloomier. <br />A key scene is where the children's dog comes face to face with the bear. The expressions on the animal's faces are superb.<br />The link between the story and the illustrations is at its best when the family has to quickly retrace their steps with the bear in hot pursuit. To heighten the pace we now get three frames per page.<br />The penultimate page is a double spread with everybody (including the dog) safely at home under the covers.

If your child is a budding birder here's a book that will both entertain, as well as inform.<br />Boonaroo Bay is normally a peaceful place but  one day the spoonbill, the darter, the cormorant, the curlew and the oystercatcher had a big dispute over who had the best beak in the Bay. But luckily Pelican who is the wisest of the birds was watching this noisy argument and decided to hold a contest to settle the question.<br />The contest was very cleverly devised since there were five events: - collect shrimp from the mud....spearing fish......extract a pipi (clam) from its shell....find a worm in the sand....and finally catch a slithery eel.<br />Each bird won the event for which its beak was best suited. This is a very good lesson in life.<br />Narelle Oliver is both author and illustrator.

It's easy to see why.<br />The beautiful water color illustrations accurately portray the area around the scenic seaside village of Lorne, located west of Melbourne Australia.<br />Elizabeth Honey is responsible for the pictures as well as the words in &quot;Not a Nibble&quot;. It's rare to see great authorship and artistic talent so effectively combined. Her story although centred on our little hero Susie, will also have great appeal for boys. After all, the story pivots around that globally popular pastime of fishing.<br />To the non-Australian reader some of the fish names may seem strange. Overcoming that,  is Elizabeth's portrayal of one of childhood's most enjoyable pastimes. The appeal of dangling a line off the end of a pier, must be a universal pleasure.<br />Susie together with Mum and Dad and three brothers have a seven-day camping holiday at Lorne. Susie is the most determined to catch a fish but she has the least luck. In fact she catches nothing! Getting teased by her brothers doesn't help. But Susie gets a special reward for her patience. While staring out to sea, almost ready to give up, she is the first to see a mother Southern Right Whale and her newborn calf.<br />This is a very rewarding book and will appeal to boys and girls of all ages.<br />.	2000-11-22

We are presented with 12 different natural environments ranging from the desert to the Arctic.<br />In each of these ecosystems there is one or more animals which must navigate through a hazardous world to find their way home. Typically, what they must avoid, are other species of animals which are their hungry predators. For example, baby turtles must try to escape to the sea before being eaten by swooping gulls. <br />Children will learn about the relationships between the different species and the local ecology.<br />The appeal of this book is in the subtle messages that come from solving the mazes. They are:- <br />There is always a path to safety..... The pleasure in being united with family at home ...... The reward is worth the search.... Confront the hazards of life and find a way around them <br />One of the best tricks in solving the mazes is to try and focus on the goal and the starting point at the same time. When you've got that, try and simultaneously view the big picture, looking at all the possible paths. With luck you'll be able to see the solution without having to trial-and-error down each possible path. <br />Each maze contains up to 21 different species of animal. At the back of the book we are shown the solutions to the mazes together with a detailed paragraph on the characteristics of each animal that features in that maze. <br />This book is the perfect combination of a game together with a valuable learning experience. This book is in the same class as Graeme Base's &quot;Animalia&quot; and deserves a wide audience.	2000-11-18

This version is retold by Polly Lawson, and is an English version of the German title &quot; Ein Marchen im Schnee&quot;.<br />The appeal of this book is in the subtle and charming illustrations done by Loek Koopmans.  <br />As each animal (in order of size and incredibility) is invited to shelter in the warmth of the mitten, the snowfall becomes heavier and heavier. When the bear appears the snow is almost a blizzard.<br />It is the woodcutter's little dog who finds his master's lost mitten and sees all the animals inside.<br />The snow has stopped.  The animals leave when the little dog barks. The old man arrives. If only the little dog could talk.	2000-11-18

Read Alison Lester's &quot;My Farm&quot; and you will be captivated by her reminiscences. <br />You will follow young Alison and her two brothers and sister through the highs (many) and lows (a few) of their young rural lives. <br />There's lots of Aussie bush humour shining through. Painting clay stripes on an old black horse gives you a &quot;Native Australian Zebra&quot; and entering your Kelpie sheep dog in the dog high jump is all part of the fun.<br />We are not shielded from the harsher realities of life in the bush. We are threatened by bushfires; round-up runaway cows and we even assist mum to deliver a newborn calf.<br />We enjoy the bounties of nature and go picking wild blackberries and field mushrooms.<br />There are some esoteric references to which only Aussies might relate, such as children swinging on the rotary clothesline, best known as the iconic Hills Hoist.<br />Alison's illustrations have a quirky charm. Faces are simply drawn, but the atmospherics of the landscapes and farm scenes are exquisite.<br />&quot;My Farm&quot; is the most sophisticated of Alison's works and neatly supplements her other works such as &quot;Bouncing and Bumping&quot; for the younger reader and &quot;Imagine&quot; her most successful book. <br />Some readers may want a glossary of Aussie terms eg chooks = hens, drover = cowboy, mobs = herd, but these all give a delightful flavour to a book which will have great appeal to all young children.	2000-11-17

Just as importantly (if books are to compete with TV) it is also very entertaining.<br />The layout of &quot;Mammals&quot; follows the zoological classifications of the various &quot;Orders&quot; such as carnivores and marsupials. It even includes a section on the monotremes, those egg laying exotic mammals from Australia, namely, the platypus and echidna.<br />This book is a refreshing change from the typical TV nature show where animals and their behaviour are often anthropomorphised. You know the thing ...... &quot; Bwana the baboon beats his chest boastfully after his latest conquest&quot;. <br />The highlight of the book is a four page panoramic fold out depicting the scene of the annual mass migration of wildebeest, zebras and gazelles across the African plains.<br />This book provides an ideal launching pad for those children who are keen to learn about the animal kingdom.	2000-11-16

He puts great  emphasis on the human dimension of science as well as on the purely  physical phenomena and theories he describes so well. The mini-biographies  of the scientists are fascinating in their own right, particularly when  looking at the historical context and the geographic, social and academic  connections/parallels that have led to these great advances in human  thought.<br />Gribbin guides us along those amazing scientific paths of the  past half millennia , from Galileo and Newton to Einstein and Hawking. He  has this reader convinced  that we are very close to realizing the ultimate  dream of a Grand Unifying Theory (GUT) which ties together all the links  between  the forces of nature. His work is right up to date and includes   the latest ideas on M-branes and superstrings.<br />The best way to read the  book is to open it at random , find a topic of interest and see how far the  hyperlinks can take you. Bliss for a net-head! The real strength of  Gribbin's writing is to help us cover that great spectrum (in time and  space) between the sub-atomic microworld of Quantum phenomena through to  the edges of the Cosmos.  Somewhere in the middle is the human dimension,  dare I say,  the \\"real world\\".<br />It was our friend Douglas Adams who posed  that trickiest of tri-lemmas ... What is the answer to that ultimate  question, that is, the Meaning of Life, the Universe and Everything ? He  told us ... it is 42 ! <br />John Gribbin's agrees - look up his section on  Planck. What is the smallest unit of time?  Answer:  zero, decimal point,   FOURTY TWO zeros, one second. <br />Before Planck time nothing much happened  ... but then again ...	1998-11-09

He meets all his friends, the elephant, the snake, the hornbill, ant-eater - they all make beautiful sounds, but none of them are for Tiger Cub - until he runs into his friend  the frog - his call needeep-needeep gives cub such a surprise - he lets out  a loud roar - &quot; ah that's the sound for me!&quot;<br />The beauty of the  book is in it's format - only 5 inches square , in hard, child proof card -  alternate pages are either cut-outs showing what's gone before - or in  front, with every second page having a transparent window with a bird,  butterfly etc. The whole effect gives a magical 3-dimensional experience as  the child works his way through the book.<br />My 16 month old son's reads  Tiger Cub first thing each morning , and last thing at night - It's his  number 1 choice from his 100+ title library (which ranges from Animalia to  Zeuss)<br />The only trouble is tracking  down more in the series ( Magic -  Look Again Books) - our copy was published by Readers Digest Australia in  1995. They cannot help me find more in the series.<br />I'm working my way  through the friendly amazon.com forest, and hopefully we will find some  more	1998-10-30
