However, one cannot help being caught up with the political drama--and learn something too. Listening to the unabridged audiobook version brings each character to life for me.  It would be tough to choose a favorite between No Safe Place, Protect and Defend and Balance of Power.  Hopefully we haven't heard the last of Chad Palmer, Kerry Kilcannon and especially Sarah Dash, hint, hint Mr. Patterson?	2003-11-08

I had thought nothing could come close to Envy, but The Crush came close.  Each new revelation about the characters' past kept me on the edge of my {car}seat.  The editor's review above managed to slam both the author and readers alike with the \\"aimed toward eighth-grade readers\\" and \\"trite phrases\\" comments.  Hopefully Ms. Brown will \\"laugh all the way to the bank\\".  Yes, I am a long-time fan of Sandra Brown and thrilled to report The Crush is a winner.  I could just see the scene at the wedding reception where Rennie and Wick meet for the first time.  Imagine Brad Pitt in a suit and wearing cowboy boots.  Whew!  I loved it that the surgeon heroine was beautiful, intelligent, successful and independent (but lonely).  The hot-headed cop hero respected her, but wasn't intimidated: \\"You couldn't melt ice on her ass\\".  Great book, suspense, romance and laughter, who could ask for more?  Well, maybe Brad Pitt...	2002-10-11

The cover art was as intriguing as the premise - I'm glad I took the plunge.  The heroine's character was likeable and the hero was a hunk.  My favorite part was her dream about the virgin sacrifice, well worth the price of the book.  It would make a cute movie with perhaps Brad Pitt playing the lead---not Sylvester Stallone, please.	2002-09-12

In Out of the Storm, two strangers seek shelter from a storm in a gamekeeper's hut, finding instant passion with each other. Introduced formally two weeks later they discover a relationship by marriage (his father recently wed her mother). Ms. Johnson did an excellent job describing the characters' emotions: lust, shame, bewilderment, pride and pain. I would recommend Delighted for this story only.	2002-06-25

Linda Howard, Julie Garwood, et. al. watch out, Sandra Brown has surpassed your latest efforts by miles.  The technique of inserting a book within a book was gripping, the hero tragic, even the education about book editing was intriquing.  The language may be shocking, but let's face it, realistic for both fraternity brothers and a man bent on revenge for the past 14 years.  &quot;That's not even a word!&quot;  &quot;What, thoroughly?  It is too.&quot; Ha!  That passage cracked me up.  Do yourself a favor and listen to the unabridged audio version of Envy.  The narrator's husky, southern voice adds to an already great script.  I got so impatient for the ending I had to buy the hardback book to read before the last two casettes.  Thank you Sandra Brown for an excellent novel.  I put Envy up there with Mirror Image, Where There's Smoke and French Silk.  More, more, more!	2001-10-23

The higher you climbed, the deeper you plunged.&quot;  This sentiment could describe my reading experiences this year, until Baby, Oh Baby.  In fact, it gets my early, albeit imaginary, vote for Best Contemporary for 2001.  The characters were deeply realistic, yet likeble.  Jake's return to the fertility clinic (&quot;The clinic was sterile.  Just like the patients who came here.&quot;) made me choke up.  Annie's attention to &quot;signs&quot; and intuition was touching, not silly.  Her steadfast resolve not to be second place was admirable:  &quot;I want a no-holds-barred, not-holding-anything-back, in-it-with-everything-I've-got kind of love.&quot;  The ending scene at the courthouse was perfect, and had me singing along...&quot;Baby, oh baby...&quot;	2001-06-14

(Referring to unabridged audio book version)  Dalden sounds great, too bad he chose Brittany as his life-mate because she slept in his arms so comfortably.  Boy, was he robbed.  Brittany's skepticism became so nauseating I started to hope one of the Sha-Ka'an creatures would take her out.  I dearly love all Johanna Lindsey novels with this big exception.  Save your money and buy older Lindsey novels.	2001-06-04

He loathed the familiar devices, the predictable ends.&quot; Fallen has neither contrivance nor a predictable end. Emma Jensen takes a ghost story, a timeless ballad, and the Isle of Skye and gives us a wonderful sequel to Entwined.  Both hero and heroine feel they are failures, undeserving of love and happiness.  I enjoyed the parallels drawn in this story and especially liked Gabriel's retrospections on life growing up with his grandfather.  The author hints that another story is on the way, write faster, please!	2001-06-03

Patti is a damn fine storyteller	Looking for a hero made me want to go to St. Augustine, spyglass in hand, wandering the shoreline for my very own pirate.  Neither Wife for a Day nor Born to be Wild can hold a candle to this feel-good tale.  Our hero was scarred inside and out, but still clung to his humanity.  Kate had a lovely child and thought of her dead husband with affection.  How refreshing!  The epilogue was one of the sweetest I've read in a long, long time.  Thank you Ms. Berg for this charming story.	2001-05-30

Either the driver was a heap-big male stud cowboy or they'd trained one of the bulls to drive.&quot;  Said cowboy, of course, is Kane Taggert, twin brother of Mike from Sweet Liar.  Humor is a staple in many of Ms. Deveraux's novels, but I think I hurt myself reading Matchmakers the first time.  It has a special place on my bookself for when I need a laugh.  Now I want an audiobook version to listen to while sitting in traffic. Please?	2001-05-29

Imagine yourself perusing the paperback section of your local grocery store when you see this book cover.  The couple seem to be dancing cheek to cheek while dressed semi-formally.  The title is All Night Long with the following summary: &quot;One passionate night can last a lifetime..&quot; Did someone put the wrong cover on the book I read?  This cover belongs on a tale of erotica, not Ms. Jerott's novel.  Rik is an earthy, forthright dairy farmer, still stinging from the betrayal by his ex-wife with his ex-best friend.  Annie is an author of documentary non-fiction trying through her book to reunite a family wrenched apart by war 160 years ago.  All Night Long is a wonderful story, even better than A Great Catch.  Do yourself a favor, ignore the ridiculous book cover and enjoy the story within.	2001-05-29

Way wrong.  I remained confused until the hero's disguise was finally revealed, then went back and re-read the beginning, ah-so!

My purchase was an attempt to complete my Suzanne Brockmann collection and I wasn't disappointed.  There was only one storyline, not three, as in her more recent offerings, for which I was grateful. The contrast between Pete's surface machisimo and inner turmoil was thoughtfully portrayed.  Likewise, I could feel Annie's frustration with being put upon for free consulting work by her boyfriend.  Her solution was ignoring his telephone messages, to which he wasn't oblivious:  &quot;I'm begining to consider taking your answering machine to the party at the musuem instead of you.  I've spoken to it more often in the past few weeks.&quot; You go girl! The maneuver reminded me of Richard Gere in Pretty Woman when he asked an ex-girlfriend if, while they were dating, she spoke to his secretary more than she did to him.  She replied simply, &quot;She was one of my bridesmaids.&quot;	2001-05-22

I prefer to think of a brown-eyed Mel Gibson. Mmmm... Remember in the Lethal Weapon series how reckless and suicidal Mel's character was? Also, it is far more appealing to think about Mel in jeans and a T-shirt. I may be naive, but I found it disturbing the way these government agents thought nothing of \\"pillow talk\\" to obtain information. Harry's profanity seemed realistic to me. Any cop that deals with these mob types isn't going to talk like Prince Charles. Did anyone else think that Baby Jane Doe had actually been adopted by the mob guy? Whew, glad I was wrong.	2001-05-22

My reading experience didn't suffer from reading them out of order.  I dearly love the tortured hero role and Ismal Delvina is one of the best. He achieved redemption after ten years penance as a government agent assigned all the worst cases.  Our heroine was no simpering ninny either.  I loved her reaction when Ismal confessed.  The long wait to see them get together was well worth it.  If only there had been an epilogue... dare we hope to see these characters again?	2001-05-19

Be forwarned, the prologue to The Last Hellion may lead to symptoms of melancholia. The cure, I'm happy to report, is found by reading the rest of this wonderful story. Grenville is more than a match for Vere, both in Vinegar Yard and in the bedroom. My favorite part was the wedding night when our hero pounded on his best friend's bedroom door: \\"The door swung inward and six and one-half feet of dark, arrogant, half-Italian, so-called friend advanced to fill the doorway. 'Ah, Ainswood. Come for instruction, have you?'\\" Hilarious. I was also glad to see Bertie from Lord of Scoundrels get some respect. His thought processes are disturbingly familiar. Do yourself a favor and read Lord of Scoundrels, The Last Hellion and Captives of the Night. Great reads, all.	2001-05-19

My audio book version of Temptation is so worn from use I'm ordering another as a Mother's Day present to myself. No such danger here. Several times while listening to this audio-book I wanted to smack Nell. Conversely, second-character Riley inspired different, ah, emotions. The story's best pattern (pun intended) was the symbolism represented by the characters' taste in china. Now I know why I wasn't jealous when my older sister got grandma's china. Thank you Ms. Crusie for a lovely story, keep it up!	2001-05-11

Likewise, after listening to The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, my camping gear was sold at the next yard sale.  While I can laugh off vampires and resurrected pets, getting lost in the woods could happen to anyone.  Trisha's indefatigable courage was awe inspiring.  I don't think I would last nine hours alone in the forest, much less nine days.  Anne Heche's child-like voice as nine year old Trisha is perfect and the story is wonderful.  Please, Mr. King, give us more books like this.  (This refers to the unabridged audio-book version)	2001-05-09

Jed's struggle with alcoholism is uncomfortably realistic and his vulnerability is touching. Kate has her own demons as well, making their story memorable.

I passed on this book on the first run through Sandra Brown's work because of the tawdry title and cover that belonged on an advertisement for an adult pay-per-view movie.  Big mistake. Cash Boudreaux was certainly no milquetoast.  He gets my vote as best hero in a Sandra Brown novel, and in my all time top ten.  I enjoyed everything about this book, especially the realistic dialogue and vivid descriptions.  I could feel the bite of mosquitoes and smell the swamp while reading in an air conditioned hotel room.  I'd love to hear the true interpretation of the rattlesnake in the story.  There was no epilogue, dare we hope to see these characters again?	2001-04-25

I read the hardback edition first, then listened to the abridged audio book and did not feel cheated on story.  In fact, the only misstep by the narrator was her Ricky Ricardo impression when Kevin was demanding an explanation from Molly.

Finding Home contains three stories, Duncan's Bride by Linda Howard (1990); Chain Lightning by Elizabeth Lowell (1999) and Popcorn and Kisses by Kasey Michaels. Of the three stories, Chain Lightning was my favorite.  I had already read Duncan's Bride and prefer Linda Howard's more recent offerings, although the ascerbic waitress character tickled me.  Popcorn and Kisses was light-hearted fun reading but a tad formulistic.  Chain Lightning by Elizabeth Lowell grabbed my attention and never let go.  I felt as though I were on an island and I didn't want to leave.  This is the first book I've read by Elizabeth Lowell but it won't be the last!	2001-04-07

For one who swore off Stephen King after Gerald's Game, Hearts in Atlantis brought me back into King's fan club.  The combination of William Hurt's narrative coupled with King's imaginative descriptions made &quot;Low Men  in Yellow Coats&quot; my favorite.  When Stephen King's voice began telling  me about college life at Chamberlain Hall in l966 I was hooked like Pete  Riley and the card game. King's Foghorn Leghorn imitation alone is worth  the price of the audiobook.  I remain confused with &quot;Blind  Willie&quot; and hope someone will explain it to me.  Perhaps I'll  &quot;start to understand it in time&quot; as Sully John did the old  mamasan.  Hearts in Atlantis is 21 hours of entertainment and years of  thoughtful enjoyment.

The first person POV of John Corey is as captivating as the peek into the mind of the terrorist, Asad Khalil.  I am a huge fan of The  X-Files and couldn't keep up with all the references, hilarious!  The  in-joke about the movie critic that bashed The General's Daughter was cute  too.  I have read most of Mr. DeMille's work and have also listened to  several of his books on audio tape.  The interview with Thomas Block and  Nelson DeMille on the Mayday audio tape was enthralling as was DeMille's  solo interview on the Spencerville audio tape.
