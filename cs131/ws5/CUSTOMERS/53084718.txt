Good JKR	The author redeems herself in my eyes with this sixth installment.  It had some very good red herrings, or at least a good mystery throughout. <br />What I didn't like about 6 is what I didn't like about 5 - the nothing happening, going on forever, no action-first 3/4 of the novel. <br />I missed the something special at the beginning, and I missed the interesting things that used to happen to these kids in classes throughout the year. <br />One feels as we continue through the series, that ORDER OF THE PHOENIX and HALF-BLOOD PRINCE were nothing until the reader gets to the ending.  Ah well, still 75% better than anything out there!!!!!  Still keeps me turning the pages, running outside at lunch to read it in my car, and looking forward to Book 7. <br />My favorites are still PRISONER OF AZKABAN and GOBLET OF FIRE with 4 being slightly ahead.

Oh she solves it again, isn't she wonderful!? Not.  And oh he loves her so much, isn't that wonderful?!  Not.  She so much smarter somehow than her highly-educated anthropologist husband and his experienced FBI agent friend?!  Not. <br /> <br />This Gideon Oliver mystery installment was wonderful in its idea of an anthropologists' convention, and that the anthropologists would have such vast knowledge, and such.  And the bones turning out to be whose they were was a great treat too. <br /> <br />But overall where was the mystery?  There was no satisfaction as to the motive, no satisfaction for the reader as to the old murders themselves.  The book just sort of ends quickly wrapping it all up in this lame excuse of a motive.

Shame on them.<br /><br />Not only was the entire story childish, but it was ridiculously adolescent. I did not care for our gallant viscount having sex with the sheep farmer tied to a chair, nor blackmailing her.  Disgusting.  I hope I never have a daughter who reads this kind of trash.<br /><br />Both characters were written like 14 year olds, boorish, silly and unlikeable.

Very nicely done, good ending, satisfying characters, and plenty of mystery left for lots more sequels. Not sure about D'Agosta & Captain Hayward's weird relationship.  But the title was so un-Preston/Child.  Yuck.  I loved their other titles, so unique and catchy.  This title is a dud.  Who picked it?  I heard the title to their next novel and love it.

I have never throughout all my education and reading understood Israel the way I did through Raquela's eyes. I had no idea the British were involved in that way, and was disappointed to learn of it.

It was so much more interesting and anthropologically intriguing than its predecessor.  I was enthralled with the piecing together of native american history. <br />The hero, Gideon Oliver, is still an overly horny devil, and that's a bit much, but when he's in \\"professor\\" mode, he's quite a likeable character.

I wasn't expecting gore or extreme horror, or even Victorian ghost stories.  But there wasn't a single good story in this bunch of duds.  And certainly NOT the supernatural or anything you'd get from reading the back of the bookcover.  <br />This book literally would put me to sleep.

I highly recommend it.  I haven't enjoyed a book so much since I read AZTEC by Gary Jennings in 1995.  Or Connie Willis' DOOMSDAY BOOK.

The author weaves a tale about Conan Doyle's beloved famous Sherlock Holmes.  <br /> <br />I'm a little tired of Holmes' brother Mycroft showing up in Holmes fiction.  The settings are atmospheric, and the Victorian time period involving.  But overall the plot plods along so slowly it was like watching grass grow to get through it.   <br />Carr doesn't come close to Conan Doyle's amazing talent of crafting a complex intelligent mystery.  Nor impressing us with Holmes' wicked skills of reason and deduction. Things are just sort of figured out or come to light and it's all rather unsatisfying to the reader.   <br />Then just when it got a little good, the novel is over.  <br />Recommended:  Laurie R.

Where have I read that before?  But what might set Gideon Oliver apart in future is his specialty, physical anthropology.  The author calls him a \\"the skeleton detective\\".  His asian Hawaiian sidekick John Lau is endearing, and my husband is also a Hawaii native who smiles and laughs a lot so I could relate to Lau.  <br />But overall the plot was a bit ridiculous with these star-crossed spies, so stupid as to spill over and trip over each other's investigations, on not one but both sides.  And the author NEVER explains the very first attempt on Gideon's life at the start.  How did things get rolling so fast when Gideon had only just arrived?  I felt let down by the whodunit solution and was not surprised by the identity of the culprit.  I had suspected him from the beginning of being involved on the wrong side.   <br />Even though I give this first installment only three stars, I will read the next couple of books by Elkins and see what happens with Dr. Oliver & Detective Lau. <br />Recommended:  THE OWEN ARCHER series by Candace Robb & THE MARY RUSSELL & SHERLOCK HOLMES series by Laurie R.

I'd seen alot on TV lately about Tom Cruise & Scientology.  I wanted to know more and to form my own conclusions. <br /> <br />This book was extremely helpful to me to see the money involved in the church of scientology.  It is an eye-opener.  I do not have a lot of respect for Hubbard.  Especially after reading this book.  20 years ago in college, I saw a DIANETICS stand having a prize drawing.  I put a card in for a prize giveaway with my name & address.  The scientology Hubbard people mailed me letters & postcards for the next 12 years until the USPS got tired of delivering them.  They were relentless in mailing me letters and postcards to join DIANETICS.  It was awful.

I needn't have worried!   <br />I loved the book.  It was an exciting page-turner, filled with exotic intrigue and bits of history about 1924 India/British relations. I could not put it down. <br />There were a few things I didn't like:  a slow, hard-to-get-into start; a seemingly unnecessary appearance by Mycroft; Mary's disguise as a man was unbelievable; and it seemed rushed to an ending with a premature wrap-up. <br /> <br />I would say one thing to readers - these novels are about Mary Russell, not Sherlock Holmes.  Holmes is the supporting character here, Mary Russell is the main character.  This does not bother me in the least once I got past firstly, the huge age difference, and secondly, that they actually married.  Their marriage was a bit hard to fathom, I felt they could just have remained friends as Holmes & Watson were.   <br /> <br />I love Ms. King's Mary Russell series and can't wait for the next installment!

The dialogue was interesting, the characters were interesting, and the relationship was building as well as the backstory of Ruthven.<br /><br />But then when the power in Ruthven Tower went out and they were attacked, before any real story got off the ground.  Reading Divine Fire at that point became about 183 pages of boredom.<br /><br />What I didn't like:  I felt no interest whatsoever in the deformed, insane doctor who'd \\"created\\" Ruthven, or cured him.  And the evildoers' stalking Ruthven and Brice in the dark building was not in the least bit scary or horrific.  It just seemed silly and contrived.  There the plot fell flat and became rather dull and stole attention away from what could have been a truly imaginative and engaging story.  Time and again I was tempted to skip pages.  Did I trip into \\"Diehard\\" in the middle of a halfway decent paranormal romance with a literary theme?  That literary theme has to be what gave this novel the hype it received.	2005-03-26

But without Low Down,the book would not have been as good.  I really enjoyed the details of the book and wish there'd been more detail to her work in the house, their work on the farm, etc.<br /><br />Another reviewer is right about Max, he was nothing to write home about as far as romantic men go.  But what Louise fell in love with was the family, the house, the home... all the things she'd never had.<br /><br />Any man would fall in love with a woman who not only is a workhorse cooking, cleaning, farm chores etc., but also has a gorgeous healthy, voluptuous body and strips for him in the kitchen.  Please.  Louise was like slave labor and free sex for him.<br /><br />But what really cost this book the 5-star rating I'd have liked to have given was the lame ending.  Why oh why didn't she tell him at the end she was carrying his child.  That just killed me and annoyed me to no end.  That the reader doesn't even get the satisfaction of knowing the reaction of the man.  The same man who swooned over Philadelphia when he thought SHE was carrying his child.	2005-03-09

I enjoyed her talking to the animals and relating to them, and I enjoyed the way he responded to her.  The horse \\"Finn\\" was great as he came around to Eliza.  Eliza was a genuine character, but Hunter wasn't too compelling.<br /><br />But the rest of the book was OK.  A nice little mystery with Blue was resolved strangely indeed.

Ms. Bacall surprised me as an insightful, funny, real down-to-earth human being!    <br />I always thought of her as this aloof ice-princess...  tall, blonde, gorgeous, ethereal... marrying THE hunk of the day, having children by him, marrying Robards, more children, etc.  But I was wrong.  This is a real woman married as a child.  Mr. Bogart truly fell in love with a mere child who grew up fast as a wife and mother and then was alone.  Ms. Bacall describes the events following Bogart's death with incredible depth and realism.  Those feelings are exactly what any young, widowed mother would feel.  Especially being woo'd by Sinatra.  I applaud her for being able to see he was not for her. <br /> <br />How can you not fall in love with this memoir?  Such honesty is refreshing in a time when the comments from stars of the day are so censored and so carefully controlled.  There's no honesty anymore, everybody's afraid to speak the truth.

Oh, do grow up gentlemen.<br /><br />Is talent now driven by publishing house requests for books \\"like\\" DaVinci Code?  BRIMSTONE was terrific, and yet it was a huge disappointment.

Either careless editing, poor research or a mistake.  But in any case a nasty distraction taking the reader right out of the story.<br /><br />The authors overall in RELIC, RELIQUARY, and CABINET OF CURIOSITIES have not done a really good job of making the reader remember a darn thing about Pendergast's family.  I had to go back and search the books on Amazon.com's \\"search inside this book\\" feature to fill myself in on the details.  Apparently those family tidbits are now become important to a future plotline.<br /><br />Preston/Child have created a very interesting character in Pendergast.  And I will continue to read their books.  But there is an ever-present smack of commercialism to this one.  It makes me think publishers are clamoring for specific storylines; telling the authors what types of scenarios to write about.  Am I wrong?  Has publishing become like Hollywood movie-making?

The heroine, Jane, is flawed, not perfect like most cookie-cutter romance novel heroines.   <br />I liked the ending.  It was enough to know for me that they found each other. <br />As I read the pages of Island of the Swans, I was reminded of Wuthering Heights and Diana Gabaldon's Dragonfly in Amber, as well as the triangle between Rhett, Scarlet & Ashley Wilkes in Gone With The Wind.  But Jane is much more a woman of honor than Scarlet O'Hara ever was, and Thomas Fraser more of a man than Ashley Wilkes.

I enjoyed the heroine's realistic responses to the situations.  Good satisfying ending.  Interesting characters, not one-dimensional cardboard cut-out's. Kept me interested along the way by the mystery of who was the villain who tried to kill the hero.<br /><br />I give 5 stars only to perfect books like GONE WITH THE WIND, LONESOME DOVE, THORNBIRDS, or AZTEC by GARY JENNINGS.  So 4-stars is very high from me.  This was a really good romance and I've been reading a lot lately including Joanna Lindsey, Judith McNaught, Julie Garwood, Ciji Ware, Mary Jo Putney, and Teresa Medeiros.  Kathleen Woodwiss is the only author whose books I've enjoyed more in the last year.  I also heartily recommend THE WOLF AND THE DOVE, and THE FLAME AND THE FLOWER.	2005-02-15

This is my third Julie Garwood novel, the first having been \\"RANSOM\\".  I enjoyed THE BRIDE very much.  What I liked most was the heroine's loyalty to her family and husband, Beak, the way the clans fell in love with her.  What I enjoyed least was the bickering dialogue between Alec & Jamie, the sub-plot was a little thin, I figured out the killer too early based on Jamie's comments, and there were some shallow, confusing scenes that should have been fleshed out a little more. <br />The fact that Andrew got all those jewels stuck in my craw - the guy shouldn't have received anything.  The scene did not have the emotion to me that the author intended.  Instead it left me  a little ho hum at the end. <br />Nice relationship between Alec & Jamie, nice heroine, simplistic novel, but it was really enjoyable overall as escapist romantic fiction.	2005-02-13

There was no spark or chemistry between Edward or Robyn at all.  No build up of their romance or attraction for each other.  They just loved each other at first sight?  Not believable. <br /> <br />Collin was not likable at all.  Jo barely, Joy less so.  Deirdre was fun but underdeveloped as a character.  The reader never knows whether to like or distrust these characters, it was frustrating.  I didn't feel I knew anyone, even Robyn very well.  They were all paper cut-outs or comic strip characters <br /> <br />Again, the premise gets 4 stars, but the story itself was weak and the love story even weaker.  I didn't sense any of Gabaldon's famous passion between this author's hero & heroine.	2005-02-12

I was 20 years old and a lifelong reader when an old married lady handed me SKYE O'MALLEY.  I thought \\"Boy, how bad will this be?!\\".  Wow, was I in for a, um, thrill!  I'm now 40 years old and married myself and this book still lives in my memory as an absolutely enthralling work of romance fiction.   <br />Of course it's romance, and total escapism, but it was also total FUN!   <br />I don't recommend this book to anyone under 21.  You have to be aware of enough to understand that romance fiction is 99% pure fantasy.	2005-02-07

The plot was complicated with ridiculous characters and kingdoms you don't even find out about until three-quarters through the novel.  I kept having to refer back to see how the heck these people were related and who the heck they were. <br /> <br />The beginning of THROUGH WOLF's EYES is wonderful, engrossing,  <br />and exciting.  <br /> <br />But once they get to court, you want to dump the book on the nearest coffee table from frustration and boredom. It really, and I mean really, gets nutty talking about a million characters you don't know, can't understand who they are, and don't care a chit about. Get back to the protagonist please!?   <br /> <br />The whole war was half-hearted and not compelling at all.  All I cared about as a reader was what was to become of Firekeeper, was the real Lady Blysse really dead, would Holly find out who Firekeeper really is....  and who was Blind Seer really, a royal wolf?  The author NEVER explains that one.   <br />I love dogs of all kinds, I'm 40 years old, and I love good fantasy. Maybe I would have enjoyed this book more had I been an eighteen-year old.  It just seemed the promise the book held remained unfulfilled.  When it ended, I just held it going, \\"huh.\\".  That's it? <br />	2005-01-24

Please.  It was also a bit strange on the religious front.  I was offended somewhat by the author's portrayel of the whole thing, and I'm not even a super religious person.   <br /> <br />The writing was childish.  No way in heaven is this in the league of Diana Gabaldon.  Not even close.  The relationship between RaEm and Cheftu is like comparing a match to an inferno with Jamie & Claire. <br /> <br />I was disappointed.  And even more disappointed when I picked up the next book only to find \\"oh look, they've travelled to a new time now\\"... here we go all over again.  Boring, yawn.

The killer came out of no where... not believable at all.  It was all too tidy and trite.  And the relationship between Carlos & Olivia was ridiculous.  Give me a break.  Only a male author would write such nonsense.  Oh yeah, and the father's just going to be fine with it, yeah OK.  I just felt it was a farfetched story to begin with.   <br />It was a dark and dreary, seedy and grizzly novel, and I did not care much for it.  It was also very confusing at times.  I didn't have as much trouble with Umberto Eco as I had with this novel.	2004-11-26

Their blurbs on the front cover sold me, so I bought the book.  It was SO obvious I could scream. The bad guys, villains, were utterly predictable from the first.  No shocks there whatsoever.  And the entire short novel felt very much like I was reading young adult fiction geared toward 16 or 17 year olds.   <br />I was not impressed and felt cheated by the other authors who gave this book great blurbs.  It should have been a graphic novel for little boys.  Oh, and Joe Pickett?  Very boring, very boy scout-one dimensional.	2004-09-20

A keeper.  I should get two.  I can actually picture some of my favorite places when I look at Tasha Tudor's illustrations.

So after 40 years of loving them, I've read almost everything by everyone about them.  I'd seen Disney's Thomasina as a child, so when I saw the book for sale used I grabbed it.<br /><br />I am enthralled by its beauty, depth and charm.  The story wound its way around my heart and never let go.<br /><br />I also recommend THE UGLY DACHSUND - a funny out-of-print story about dogs and TAILCHASER'S SONG, a watership-down type story, but wonderful.  And two of my all-time favorites, THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY and WHERE THE RED FERN GROWS.<br /><br />Nothing I've read in the last 15 years, no fiction at least, can touch these beloved stories.<br /><br />If you enjoy non-fiction and enjoyed Thomasina, read THE DOG WHO RESCUES CATS about an adoreable little mutt Ginny who finds and rescues injured and needy stray cats.

The wonderfully unique and important message, and philosophy, of the protagonist takes a backseat to the superfluous, neverending details of the settings in this overlong novel.  It needed a better editor.   <br />It is a masterpiece, no doubt, but I had to work to get through the descriptions of everything to the plot.

S.L.W.C. was my fifth Preston/Child book having read RELIC, RELIQUARY, THUNDERHEAD, and CABINET OF CURIOSITIES. <br /> <br />But, I did not like the following-  <br />a) somewhat one-dimensional boring characters,  <br />b) that the gross turkey factory had nothing to do with what happened,  <br />c) that what did happen was just sociological and that took the fun right out of it,  <br />d) there was something wrong with the whole atmosphere of Kansas.

I found myself frustrated with her whereas I had more respect for Gwen in the Kiss of the Highlander.  It was terrible that Silvan tells Daegus that he's the favorite over Drustan, no father would say that to one of twin sons.  And the whole story about a tortured hero who can be saved only by the one mate, and uttering a binding spell was shamelessly unoriginal and imitative of Christine Feehan's &quot;Dark&quot; series... Otherwise he will become &quot;a dark one&quot; and lose his soul, again just like Feehan's series.<BR>Easy ending, too easy.

Very cute, very different cadence to the narrative.  Enjoyed it.  Not a strong plot, especially if you like page turners.  This book meanders like a collection of short stories.  America-bashing while glorifying Botswana.

The characters are entertaining, but again the plotlinein this book is dull. The novel is just barely worth reading for the pleasant local color, but as far as mystery fiction goes, I would rather reread Ellis Peters, Anne Perry, Elizabeth Peters, or Cynthia Peale. <BR>The back cover led me to expect &quot;the case that tugs at her heart, and lands her in danger, is that of a missing eleven-year-old boy, who may have been snatched by witch doctors.&quot;  What?!  Where?!  The missing boy case was a teensy part of the book, and certainly did not tug at my heart strings at all.  There was barely anything made of it at the end.

This book was great - action, mutated godzilla-sized jungle creatures, explosions, dismemberment, head shrinking, a dash of kinky sex, poison darts, treachery, greed, medical science, lost tribes, plague threatening the world, prehistoric plants, and regenerating body parts! Whew, to name a few.    (...)	2004-04-05

Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette, and Me	Books	5	18	20	N	N	It was a sentimental testament to a failed relationship	I enjoyed this book.  It was a love story, no more no less between two young people.  Michael was her boyfriend, she meets JFK Jr. and is swept off her feet by the idea of being married to a rich gorgeous guy who is American royalty and the most eligible bachelor in the world!  BUT, she retains feelings of lust or love for Michael.  Ah, the classic triangle.  <br />Whether he said &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, I don't believe in the end Carolyn had the strength to leave JFK Jr.  She probably belonged with Michael because he made her feel needed and special.	2004-03-31

How anyone could read it, then go off believing such ridiculous racist nonsense is unbelievable.  Are people really that stupid?!  It wasn't even a good story, so simplistic in writing style.  <br />Maybe if you're a boy 15 to 25 and used to reading graphic novels and comic books you might enjoy it.	2004-03-18

I do not understand why anyone would think their faith is better than someone else's.  I cannot imagine equating tolerance of evil with tolerance of a buddhist friend, or a non-christian friend, or a muslim friend etc.  This book was ridiculous, but it was also scary.  <br />What would Jesus do?  I try to think of that.  He would invite everyone in to dine with him and love us all.  After all God made all of us in his image, we are all here for a reason.  Maybe that reason is to love one another and accept goodness and acts of kindness from even those who do not share our own faiths.	2004-03-05

Next I would like the author to write a similar history of dissent amongst the Christian religious groups in the world today from Roman Catholicism to born-again christians to Lutherans, to the Church of England.  <BR>I see nothing different about people.  <BR>Whether they are Jews or Christians, Muslims or Hindus, Buddhists or Sufi, people will always disagree, they will always see things from their perspective, and there will always be dissent even amongst members of the same church or same parish.  <br />The challenge that the author fails to address is how any religion can avoid fractious politics.

I found it to be nothing more than a platform for the author's very christian conservative views.  <BR>I absolutely do not agree with the author's statement, &quot;our children are being raised in a society that has largely rejected the concepts of truth and morality&quot;.  No way.  Our children are being raised by parents and peers as they have been for thousands of years.  We are responsible for their upbringing, not society.  And we need to teach them religious tolerance. Not the type of venomous hatred this author seeps into his narratives.	2004-03-05

He has seen it all and offers behavioral solutions as well as indications of medication that may offer help to the helpless.  Anyone who thinks medication is &quot;thrown at the dog&quot; is wrong.  Dr. Dodman obviously cares, and we know that human beings with psychological issues are very often helped by medications.  Why should our beloved dogs be any different.<br />I loved this book.  I learned so much.  I learned to not play with flashlight beams with puppies and not encourage those types of behaviors.  I learned how to react, and not react, to a dog's fear of loud noises or thunder.  <br />I thank the author and publisher for making this book available and opening the door to the public about dog behavior.  I look forward to reading his next book A-Z.	2004-02-13

The time-traveling vampires had me so intrigued, as did the back cover, that I jumped enthusiastically into FOREVER AND THE NIGHT.  Unfortunately what I found there was trite, nothing new, and downright silly.  <BR>The heroine Neely is ridiculous, and stupid.  The plotline about the bad senator was ludicrous.<BR>Aidan is a pathetic protagonist. They fall in love immediately, gak, give me a break.  A family of vamps with 2 little eerie girls a la Anne Rice, a warrior angel with such an original name, &quot;Nemesis&quot; oh lordy my eyes were rolling.  Silly.<br />Read the second one, FOR ALL ETERNITY - that was great!  Five stars.  Or read Christine Feehan's &quot;DARK&quot; series which draws you into its own reality and legend, you won't be able to stop reading those &quot;DARK&quot; books.  Or find Charlaine Harris's &quot;Dead Until Dark&quot;. Also superb.	2003-12-29

Thank goodness Valerian is back!  Cheers.  Maeve is an awesome character, the romance with Calder and his history was interesting, especially set in the Civil War, but the battle with Lisette and the consequences of the outcome.... WOW.  Cool vampire romance.  I still favor the Christine Feehan &quot;Dark&quot; series, but I will definitely be reading the next two L.L.Miller vamp novels!  I also enjoyed the combined PB issue, SPRINGWATER SEASONS by L.L.Miller.	2003-12-29

However, I was a bit disappointed in the latest book after having read and loved the last one in which he travels to Wales.  <BR>The Cross-Legged Knight was very dark and depressing.  Owen is unhappy and unfulfilled, Thoresby is old and depressed, Lucie is sad and depressed.  Jasper's character was utterly unused as were Bess &amp; Tom Merchet &amp; Brother Michaelo (OK he spied a little).  <BR>I usually finish one of Robb's Owen Archer novels on a thrilling high, smacking the book shut with utter satisfaction.  This time it was not to be.  I can't help wonder if the author was distracted away from Owen's tales by her new baby, the scottish medieval series. <br />What I disliked most about this one aside from the dark and depressed atmosphere was the dangling unresolved question of how did the murderer and victim know each other.  I felt betrayed by the author, who's never left me the reader like that before.	2003-11-26

The whole scenario was annoying and far-fetched with the jewels.  The reunion of the two lovers was touching.

Bravo to the author for finally giving loyal fans a visit with the the other characters we all fell in love with... Jacques & Shea, Gregori & Savannah, Desari & Julian, Darius & Tempest.  Whatever's going on with the Prince & Raven and Aidan & Alexandria?  The Prince never seems to leave his castle.<br />The love story in this book was beautiful.  It was very original to have the lifemate be pregnant already.  I loved Dark Symphony also, unlike a few others reviewers, I thought Byron & Antonietta had a very beautiful love.  My least favorite I would have to say were Dark Magic and Dark Fire, both disappointingly simplistic and not moving.  Such potential with the two possibly most enigmatic sexy Carpathians of all, Darius & Gregori!  <br />What I would love to see more of is a flushing out of the Carpathian storyline.  What's happening with their people?  What's going on in the Carpathian Mountains with the Prince and Raven.  Who has had children?  What happened to the young telepathic girl living with Francesca who lived wolves?  <br />I'm really not too interested in the author introducing all new South American characters.  I had trouble adjusting to the long-lost Darius clan, and hate that the books have drifted away from Mikhail and Raven so much.  So I will probably get Dark Destiny and Dark Secret in the library.<br />But when and if this author comes out with a novel that reaches back to the dark roots of the Carpathian Mountains and the Prince, then I'll be pre-ordering from Amazon.com for sure.	2003-11-09

Beyond the wonderful writing, there is amazing plot, divided loyalties, real emotions, intrigue, always unexpected twists, realistic problems filled with drama.  I loved this book as much as Robb's previous 'Owen Archer' novels.  <br />The way in which this author manages to convey the thoughts and myriad of motivations behind her characters never ceases to amaze me.  Everyone is so real with their own loyalties, and their own interests.  Even Owen and Lucie's relationship is made all the more special to this reader because of the true way in which the author conveys their own doubts sometimes about each other, sometimes about themselves.  I am enchanted by Wales and Owen's roots there.  I'm intrigued by St. David's and the Welsh history of the time.<br />I can't wait to read the next book.  And I'm considering going back to APOTHECARY ROSE and starting all over again.  These mysteries are wonderful.	2003-09-14

I enjoyed The White Crow as much if not more than the first and second books in the series.  Her characterizations are excellent (and not just the main characters!), the plot is entertaining and well-planned, and the way she captures old Boston at the turn of the century is nothing short of brilliant.

It kept my interest throughout the evenings of an exciting vacation.  I very much enjoyed the details about the characters involved in the story.

Certainly Holmes is almost nonexistent... but it kept me turning those pages furiously.  <BR>I truly relished Ms. King's glorious descriptions of Old Badger Place and Justice Hall.  The return to England for this book was an excellent choice.  I enjoyed this book as much as her first two, maybe more in some ways.  The unravelling plot took exciting twists and emotional turns.  <BR>I wasn't crazy about O Jerusalem, less so even The Moor.

I understand the Voldemort returns factor had to be dark and foreboding, but this book lacked any of the humor of the last four.  The book seemed to need editing in the first 600 pages.<br />A few nice surprises explaining a few things.  But the death didn't have the punch I think the author intended.  It just sort of happened, lackluster.  <br />Harry's anger bothered me.  He was whiney and cranky as another reviewer mentioned.  Overall, there just wasn't a lot of excitement in the first 800 pages.  You learn a few things key to the story going back and looking forward, but what I really waited for was exposed in the final few chapters.<br />Of course I'll anxiously await the next one.  And of course I'll probably reread Goblet of Fire.	2003-07-07

I read it out loud with a significant other when I was 21.  And now, picking it up the other day and crying in the bookstore as I read the opening chapter, I just finished this book for the third time.  Needless to say, I love it.  Right up there with The Incredible Journey, The Black Stallion, and Mary O'Hara's Flicka/Thunderhead series.  As well as James Herriot's unabridged dog stories.  <br />Where the Red Fern Grows taught me about devotion, hard work, and dedication to your dogs.  I still have dogs, now I have three and yes one is a big 98 lb. red hound.  And I wonder looking back if that's why I picked him. <br />Just read this book.

Although Robin's relationship with Richard was unclear throughout the lengthy book, it could have been flushed out a bit better.  I enjoyed the book.  I'll look for the sequel as well.

I loved the setting and the way the author wove the Nantucket scenery, folklore, and history into the plot.  I felt almost like I was on the island.  But the reason I didn't give it more stars was because of the constant strife and antagonism between the two lovers Jane and Mac.  It just didn't make a good heartwarming lovestory.  They should have been trying to solve the Judith mystery together, finding themselves falling in love as they worked side-by-side at something... I don't know.

I really enjoyed this page-turning, exciting action-packed papal conspiracy piece of vampire fiction!  I did not like AT ALL what happened at the beginning of the epilogue - it was not in keeping with the rest of the story and was a let down.  But Christopher Golden really has created a great mythos here and I read the book in two days!  I loved Peter, Meaghan, George, and Cody.  I can't wait to read the rest.  <BR>My only other complaint is that some of the violence read like a graphic novel, or something written for teens, and the giant monster with multiple vaginas... please, too gross; I noticed there were no multiple-phallused demons, ahem.

In that Mr. Eisner succeeds tremendously in telling a unique and touching story of Francisco and Brother Lucas, Andre & Isabel.  I really enjoyed this historical novel, although it is not an epic, and that's OK.  <BR>The scenes in the prison hole touched me most of all, and the ending was satisfying, not overdone.  I highly recommend this novel, not because it's \\"historical\\", but because it's a lovely story set in an interesting time and place.	2003-04-12

Good thing I didn't read this first or I'd never had read another Krinard book.  This book was such drivel I can't believe it earned 4 1/2 stars out of 22 reviews.  The romantic lead, &quot;Luke&quot;, is such a totally unlikeable, one-dimensional, nasty character nobody could love him even a bit.  And there was no chemistry in the love scenes, they were downright dry.  The interesting mystery about Joey's missing parents could have been the saving grace, but it was a total dead end.  <BR>There is really nothing I can recommend about this book.  I would recommend Christine Feehan's Dark series or Sherilyn Kenyon's work if you like fantastical romance, lovespell etc.	2003-03-31

It was quite disturbing and insightful psychologically into sexually-abused women, bisexual women, and sadomasochists. <BR> <BR>But overall I have to agree with the reader who said, \\"The book is really well written and I might be willing to read another book by this author.... but this book is just too ugly.<br />I had nightmares after reading this book, it bothered me for weeks.

I really enjoyed The Scarletti Curse and Ms. Feehan did a nice job of weaving the two stories together.  She captured the gothic sense of the palazzo and managed to weave in the Carpathian lifemate theme as well.  Byron was a little too patient at times.<br />The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star book for me was the ridiculous drivel about the dragonseekers and wizards.  Ooh boy, enough silliness already.  I hope it goes nowhere because it was nonsense.<br />Antonietta was wonderful.  The book really rocked at the end.  LOVED the Borzoi Celt being introduced.

These two didn't seem as perfect a fit as Gabriel and Francesca.  I loved that the other couples are mentioned more often in this installment of the series.  I enjoyed Jaxon's past as a paramilitary trainee and saucy policewoman, but she just flopped as a heroine.  She was just a whimp and I expected more strength and maturity from that type of character.  And give me a break, a sniper from one mile away straight through a spinal cord?  ha ha.  And very unlikely that the oldest ancient and most cunning hunter didn't have a clue?  I felt that Gabriel needed Francesca more, Francesca was so strong and confident.  I hoped for some of that in Jaxon but got none of it.  <BR>I really enjoyed the ending, great ending.  But overall not as good as Dark Legend, Dark Gold, Dark Magic, or Dark Challenge.	2003-02-16

The love scenes were super steamy, but also tender.  Kudos to the author on pulling that off!<BR>I've been entranced by Christine Feehan's Dark Carpathians series lately and await Dark Symphony so this was the first time in a few weeks I've read anything different and I was not disappointed!

Like other readers, once I started this series, I have been unable to put them down.  After ten years of diligently scouring the so-called respectable fiction aisles at bookstores looking for a thumping good read and being disappointed regularly, I finally decided to give romance a try again.  Since I'm a vampire fiction fan, I thought the Feehan Dark series might appeal to me.  <BR>This book makes up for any repetition in the last novels.  It is original.  The hero is incredible.  The heroine was brilliant and her being a carpathian healer who's avoided detection by carpathians is a stunning plot twist.  <BR>I loved the entire story - Brice, Skylar, Lucien, the Paris setting.  I absolutely loved that Francesca sought Aidan's help and was thrilled Aidan sent a human couple to Francesca &amp; Gabriel's aid.  It was very satisfying and not predictable at all.	2003-02-09

The story lacks mention and history of the other characters - how could you not mention to Tempest that Raven was human, hello!<BR>The author should have just called her Rusti, it was a much better name.  <BR>I could see the Barrack Sindyl thing coming a mile away in the last book. <BR>I'd like to read about Julian & Desari's visit to Aidan & Alex who I loved, not just read a passing sentence that they went.  And I'd like to read about Gregory & Darius meeting, and Barrack & Sindyl's visit to Carpathia to meet Prince Mikhail.  The author does a disservice to her loyal readers not to keep those characters alive.<BR>OK! OK! I get the idea - light to his darkness, lifemates, three blood exchanges, human psychic women, the male suddenly sees things in color again, dirt & saliva heals, feed but don't kill, sleep in the ground, shapeshift, etc.  The plots are so repetitive I could be reading the same books since Dark Gold.  Independent gorgeous woman rebels against the dominant sexy Carpathian male.  After a few romantic interludes she falls deeply in love and is now 100% devoted.  About two thirds into the novel, suspense of the story kicks in and it becomes a thriller at the end where they're threatened and attacked either by an ancient vampire or some fanatic vampire hunters.  <BR>The honey baby stuff was cloying.	2003-02-06

I was enjoying this book so much, I was stealing away every chance I could to indulge in reading.  However their love fell apart when Robert showed up. From there it was downhill all the way.  I don't care how expertly you bring them back together or whatever, the love just never recovers from that jolt.  It ruined the entire novel for me.  Even the epilogue couldn't save it.  And don't insult me by telling me you brought back Alex & Jordan for fans!  If the author can't come up with an original story for these two wonderful characters, she should have left them out entirely.  I am so tired of authors feeling they've satisfied readers' requests if they simply mention prior characters somehow.  It's a cop out.  Ian was a very romantic, dashing hero and Elizabeth was great, but she should have actually used her pistol skills to shoot someone!  The author weakened her in my eyes by making her so over-gentle.	2003-02-05

OK Desari had some skills, but still disappointing.<BR>The heroine, Shea, of Dark Desire is a reknowned surgeon and there's a lot of intelligence there.

Why not have &quot;The Dark One&quot; come to aid Julian and Darius, at least in some small way?  Weird.  It seemed really odd to me.

What can I say?  I loved the journey through Wales, the pilgrimage.  It was great to meet Martin the Fleming again (Jasper's old friend).  Sir Robert and Michaelo were wonderful.  Tangwystl, yes what a beautiful name.  It was fascinating to find out Owen's feelings upon revisiting Wales, crossing the Severn, meeting up with countrymen and family.

I didn't like the ending because I felt saddened and left hopeless by it.  But I didn't want the book to end in the first place.  <BR>It was total escapist historical fiction; 1100+ ages read like 300.

I felt it has such potential, but just lost my interest when it went nowhere.  I don't know what people thought was so wonderful about the ending (other reviews), I thought it was ho-hum.  The story, or plot, should have been interesting, but it wasn't.  <BR>The best thing about the book was the Polish driver's history, and the mystery about the protagonist's true nature.	2002-09-12

It was so boring and oversimplified.  The only interesting characters were &quot;Skip&quot;, Nora's brother, and &quot;Black&quot; the midden-heap archeologist.  The authors need to practice character development.  The plot was more of a plod until they actually got to the city, then it picked up.

I really enjoyed the book and left it feeling good about it and wanting to read the rest in the series.  However, there were pages I skimmed through full of superfluous descriptions of air and dirt (to me).  I had the sense the author was pandering to a minority audience to sell books.  But overall I liked it.  I much preferred Hambly's two vampire novels, and Dragonsbane/Dragonshadow.  But I must admit when I'm done with Steven Saylor's Roman mystery series and Candace Robb's Owen Archer series, I'll return to Hambly's Benjamin January series.	2002-08-15

I believe it would be ignorant to say the possiblity does not exist that Pope Joan was real.  There is just too much historical evidence to the contrary through the 1300's.  That being said, this novel was a work of historical fiction, and had some romance thrown in for good measure to explain the stillborn babe.  I thoroughly enjoyed Joan's pursuit of academic knowledge and learning, and could definitely empathize with women of the period.  I am a religious, 39 yr. old married woman, and my opinion is that men rarely give women of history the credit they deserve in literature.	2002-08-12

It was so interesting, exciting, but in just the right amount to keep you intellectually stimulated.  It was believable and so well-written I just loved reading it so much.  The end was fine, I was a little confused about it, but I liked the book so much I would read something by Mr. Lindsey again in a minute. I could hardly put this book down.

Not mature enough to make good decisions, selfish and wicked enough to wish people harm and definitely immature enough to not realize that there is a reaction to every action.  Well done.

What I liked about the book was the descriptive passages about the mountains of tibet and the streets of calcutta.  The various theories about shambala were also imaginative.

The book had so much potential, but unfortunately midway through the plot takes off after the nasty bad guy who nobody cares about reading, and remainder of the book was boring and useless.  The second half seemed disjointed from the first half.  Why couldn't it be a book about how they survived and trials they went through cultivating land, trading, exploring the bronze age world?!?!  Very disappointing.  The second half of this book ruined it for me, I felt tortured having to read through it to find out what happened at the end.

The characters were so beautifully developed, the scenery so vivid, I was &quot;there&quot;.  I hated Bill Jaxon and that character went nowhere - that's my only criticism.  None of the miners' characters went anywhere, they were sort of superfluous.	2002-06-17

I am a thirty-something adult and horror novel fan (non-King stuff mostly).  I was very impressed with Pike's ability to build suspense and to scare the pants off me.  Most of the reviews here are by folks who've been reading his books for years, or read his other books as young adults.  <BR>I thought Lauren and Jennifer were ridiculously young for us to believe....especially Lauren in her astronaut and m.d. role.  This evoked an adolescent feel to the novel.  <BR>And the ending just wrapped the whole thing up too easily by twisting the two stories together, and that disappointed me.

It didn't hold me right away - I wasn't hooked until Jamie &amp; Claire stayed with Aunt Jocasta - but the book seduced me and by the time they set off from River Run, I was reading in the car at lunch, reading through dinner, and devouring the story.  The author's description of the American setting enthralled me, as did the goings on of farming, economy, indian relations, etc.  Claire and Jamie's scenes together were still the best in the book, but I did enjoy Bree &amp; Roger's relationship toward the end, but still not as much.

Stirling's review on the cover, &quot;One of the best fantasies I've read in 15 years, bar none&quot;, I couldn't wait to read this book.  I was so disappointed.  It read like it was written for live-at-home (in the basement) young adults.  There was no flow to the story, it was choppy and badly strung together.  There was no development of any relationship between Ash and her officers.  The author tries to hook the reader with a gratuitous sexual violence scene in the first five pages that I found boorish, foul, and unnecessary, especially as it concerned an eight-year old girl.  The e-mail's inserted were stupid and extremely distracting to the story, not adding but detracting.

The author enthralls us with magical powers and romantic history and dreams that all erupt in tragic terror.  A horrid and tragic book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading.  Now I will close my mind for awhile and pretend I never read it to recover.	2000-12-14

Despite that it is a beautifully imagined and beautifully written book, it lacks the magic to make it a great or wonderful novel.  I enjoyed reading it, but I was disappointed in the character, her development or lack of it, and I guess I just felt the book was missing something.  My expectations were very high because it was highly recommended.  I would read Delia Sherman again.	2000-12-12

I couldn't put it down during what was supposed to be a romantic clipper ship cruise out of old mystic village harbor for my anniversary.  Boy I never lived that down with my spouse.

Besides, don't we always see ourselves differently than others see us anyway?  Duh.  Would you expect anyone else to write the same biography of you as you'd write in your own autobiography?

The solution came at the end out of nowhere in the plot... it seemed just gratuitous to be written as a mystery at all. And it had such potential!  The relationship between the protagonist and his sons Eco and Meto was fabulous and engaging.  The existence of a mysterious mine and thousands of bones and skulls could have really gone somewhere.... but in the end the last 8th of the book just bored me to tears and I found myself skipping speech after speech about the politics of the time rather than the plot just to find out how the book ends.	2000-11-15

It still keeps the reader enthralled from beginning to end.  However, the marriage between Holmes &amp; Russell seems even more odd in this chapter of their lives.  There's something awkward about it certainly.  It does seem odd that he calls her Russell and there's a certain lack of physical affection.  But overall, a good book with a red herring.

I cried near the end, and it has been years since a book made me cry.  The author brought me into the lives of the people in the 1300's, I felt as Kivrin did. It was surprisingly spiritual, especially through the religion and belief of the parish priest.  The two stories, present and past, were related, but unrelated.  It was so clever and all came together and made sense in the end.  The story addressed loss and love of fellow mankind in a very effective way.  I really cared about the danger Kivrin was in, I felt the author portrayed the dangers very realistically making us readers feel the fear and helplessness Kivrin must have felt, as well as Mr. Dunworthy.	2000-11-02

It was hard to get into at first, but once I caught the cadence of the dialogue, I was hooked.  The book was very thought-provoking, enjoyable, at times it was horrible to endure the graphic imagery of the violence against the &quot;New Christians&quot; ---with tears in my eyes.  There was deep, spiritual love.  So much violence and hatred also.  But the author handled it realistically in that the aftermath the &quot;Old Christians&quot; seemed to sugarcoat what they had done to be able to deal with the atrocity of their actions.	2000-10-26

We must remember that this is one man's viewpoint.  And again, he was not there.  The book seemed to me to try too hard to minimize the facts, and put them into some kind of &quot;author's personal perspective&quot;.  It reminded me of books I've read trying to downplay the Holocaust, diminishing the number of innocents killed.  Does any of it really diminish the power of the Inquisition?  Even if it was fear and power, people still were tortured and died.  I just felt there was too much self-promotion of the author's lifelong views in the book.	2000-10-25

I picked up &quot;NIGHTSHADE&quot; at the library, and I have to tell you this is a thoroughly enjoyable book.  It's well thought through, the plot is  delicately planned, leading the reader this way and that.  IT's a whodunit,  a mystery, a family novel, a thriller, a detective story, but most of all a  true ghost story.  It had my heart pounding at times, and I had to read the  final 200 pages well into the night to get to the end or I wouldn't have  been able to sleep.  Well done, Mr. Saul.

Excitement at every chapter, intrigue, wonderment, adventure, so so very well written and the character  development was exceptional.  I loved it and wish I'd read it sooner.	1999-02-03

DID NOT DISAPPOINT	WATERBORN sat on my bookshelf for awhile, untouched.  Then one day after reading another great review I began to read....and read....and read.... and before I knew it I was absorbed in this fabulous tale. I have  recommended it to everyone I know and can't wait to read the sequel!	1999-02-01

I picked it up in the doctor's office and never put it down.  It wasn't the great american novel, but it was highly readable, interesting, surprising, and I enjoyed the read very much.  I will read more of Ms.  Lindsey.	1999-01-06

Initially, I chose to read this mystery because I was in the mood for a good mystery and it was one of the shorter ones on my bookshelf; but as I got into it I found the author does a really nice job of telling a story.   I'd recommend the book, especially as a read at bedtime.	1999-01-06

I liked the characters, especially the college professor lost in the woods and Mrs. Pentland &amp; Nora Bonesteel.  But I didn't think the book was a five-star novel, nor the best novel of  the year as the cover touted.	1999-01-06

Suffice to say in my short little review  here that I loved it.  Yes loved it.  I miss this book, and I miss Mixtli.   Gary Jennings, who are you and what do you have inside you that enabled you  to write such an incredible story of such awesome historical detail?  But  it is not the historical detail that make this book a masterpiece; it is  the characters, the story, and the compelling emotion I still feel when  thinking about AZTEC three years later.	1998-09-25

The  promise of a thumping good read in historical fiction-- my favorite.  But  as I read on, the story is continuously, unexpectedly , interrupted by odd  segments of gratuitous sex that read as if they were inserted to satisfy  the romance genre.  While I loved the premise of the heroine and hero,  their characters did not captivate me.  The character development somehow  did not have me giving a darn about these people.  I'd turn the page and  end up somewhere lost in a sudden change of scene.  My personal review of  three stars was given due to the wonderful historical detail and plot, not  to the writing itself.  But I would read something of hers again...there's  something that smells of promise here.  This book just wasn't as fulfilling  as I had hoped.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.  But a good read  overall, and as I mentioned earlier, excellent historical detail!	1998-08-14

How I wish I had  discovered her novels when I was younger (hey maybe they weren't written  yet?).  But even now, as a 35 yr. old, I enjoyed her books tremendously and  the spirit of her heroines captured my heart.  Wonderful stories, truly.   Better than other fantasy fiction I have read for adults, and better than  other fantasy fiction writers.	1998-08-14
