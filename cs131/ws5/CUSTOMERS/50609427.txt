As an introduction, I am a health care professional whose math in college really only consisted of multi-variable calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and statistics.  I'm studying tensors to follow Relativity mathematically (and it might just be useful for some research projects I'm involved with).  To that end, I'm looking for clear, easy books teaching me tensor analysis.<br /><br />This book is a nice one.  Although written in the 1930s, it is surprisingly clear.  Concise.  McConnell conveys things in simple, direct terms that make concepts so obvious what others can't ever get around to saying.<br /><br />Much of it may be that unlike many books on tensors, McConnell doesn't jump into affine transformations or elasticity applications-- he starts with tensors in rectilinear coordinates, the plane, the straight line.  Concepts that for me were so well-understood/ingrained they were intuitive.  Then, how tensors made complex calculations in these settings simple.  How powerful tensors are!<br /><br />He transitioned to cones and quadrics.  Then curves, surfaces, rigid bodies.  Finally applications.  Electricity and Magnetism, stress analysis, some fluid dynamics.  Lastly, Special Relativity.  It effectively builds you to this point.<br /><br />Drawbacks?  It was so succinct, that in a few places I didn't completely understand (more likely a lack of background for fluid dynamics, for example), it was hard to figure out why/where the deficit was coming from.  Few answers to problems despite claiming otherwise.  And no real look at tensors in gravitation theory beyond Special Relativity.<br /><br />For such a short book, very helpful.	2005-03-16

It focuses on the ongoing adventures of Jack Shaftoe and the Duchess Eliza in alternating chapters.<br /><br />The good: more frequently witty, a real plot that is interesting at times, less European history didactic, some real adventure.  We see a much more focused purpose behind the plot, like the story is actually going somewhere.  I think it effectively builds for the climactic third volume such that you end up looking forward to reading System of the World.  There are some real cute revelations that made me nod with appreciation, and some dialogue that I admired as quintessential distillations of that era, although many of the characters started sounding tiresomely alike, at times.<br /><br />The bad: it's long, and tiresome at times.  For all that it's 800-ish pages, the story is wearisome in detail in places that seem to serve no purpose, but yet will jump about plot-wise at seemingly key junctures.  For example, Jack is a multi-zillionaire with hijacked gold whose adventures to get that gold we have experienced through clever and well-written narrative.  The next time we see Jack, he is a destitute fugitive in the Middle East, donating his blood via a gazillion insect bites to a local scientist.  The gold is gone.  What happened?  This happens again and again, and it's just bloody bizarre.  One still follows the storyline, and I see now why he did some of it now that I am reading Book Three, but I still am not convinced it was Stephenson's intent or an editor's scalpel to effect some of the transitions that way. While not as obvious with Eliza's storyline, this still occurs to some extent.  Perhaps because I have not yet finished Volume Three, but there were some scenes that could have been deleted altogether.<br /><br />The ugly: Daniel Waterhouse's storyline is addressed, but is essentially put on hold.  Like a two second cameo in a movie-- I'm still here, I'm still alive.  I'm thinking about something grand and am planning an epiphany, but it hasn't happened yet.  Newton/Leibniz likewise takes a significant back seat in this volume, and their roles were certainly the most intriguing part of the storyline.<br /><br />I am about one-third through System of the World.  Newton and Leibniz are back.  So far, I give it 4 stars again.  I'll let you know when it's done...king about something grand and am planning an epiphany, but it hasn't happened yet.

US	50609427	RSWTNSTO2H7CR	0520088174	604749078	The Principia : Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy	Books	5	43	47	N	N	Wonderful overview, somewhat overwhelming.	This is a wonderful reference, but frankly, it was overwhelming for me.  Let's just say that while the first two sections of this book were clear, informative, meticulously and thoroughly footnoted and annotated, the last section-- the actual translation-- proved beyond my abilities.  I'd HIGHLY recommend a college-level geometry course before attempting to read the actual translation of Newton's revolutionary work.<br /><br />Frankly, the combination of archaic verbiage (Cohen kept a number of obsolescent terms in translating from the original Latin), combined with a predominately narrative style (reading in an entire paragraph what can in modern mathematical symbology be articulated in a single line) combined with my lack of working analytic geometry enabled me to follow this seminal work conceptually, but not in detail.  Other reviwers have suggested that a working knowledge of calculus and Newtonian physics is required.  I disagree.  To follow Newton's proofs in detail, it is Euclidean geometry that is required.  Newton's Principia CONCEPTUALLY utilizes calculus, but the proofs themselves are Euclidean with the concept of \\"infinitisimally small\\" added to the equation.  I have single- and multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, differential equations (first-, second-order, and partial), and graduate-level statistics under my belt.  Junior high school geometry is insufficient to understand his work.  So far, I am studying tensors, differential geometry/exterior calculus with respect to gravitation physics without too much difficuly.  Geometry!<br /><br />Otherwise, this book was wonderful.  Section One is a thoroughly researched historical background.  Social setting, scientific thought at the time, the controversies of the times, historical perspective, insights into Newton himself.  Wonderfully referenced and annotated.<br /><br />Section Two is a clear \\"How to Read\\" section-- discussing section by section of the Principia what the main concepts and issues are, even critiquing Newton's flaws and obvious attempts to fill in gaps or alter data when existing data were insufficient to his theories!  Cohen even guides us step-by-step through some of the more important proofs in the Principia-- proofs that for the most part I followed, except for certain geometric assumptions that I had to assume were true.<br /><br />My fascination has always been relativity... which I am working on understanding now.  When finished, I may read a college-level text in analytic geometry, then come back to this.  But I was impressed by the sheer breadth of conceptual material Newton covered.  Certainly entitling his last book of The Principia \\"The System of the World\\" was justified.s flaws and obvious attempts to fill in gaps or alter data when existing data were insufficient to his theories!

Rather than a sequel, he has embarked on an epic prequel.  After reading Quicksilver, the first of a trilogy set in late 17th Century Europe, I still think he's bloody brilliant, but felt that I should develop a measuring system for whether folks will like this book.  Give yourself the indicated number of points if you agree with the following statements.  At the end, total your points, and I'll provide a scale as to~~ whether you will like/love/dislike/hate this book.<br />You love European history:  +3 points<br />You love lots of details in what you read: +3 points<br />You're into Newton/Leibniz and things scientific: +2 points<br />You think Neal Stephenson is bloody smart: +2 points<br />You loved Cryptonomicon for its detail: +1 point<br />You loved Cryptonomicon for its style: +1 point<br />You loved Cryptonomicon for its wit: -1 point<br />You get bored by endless detail: -2 point<br />You like a strong plot in the novels you read:~~ -1 point<br />You like a plot, however strong, at least clearly stated: -1 point<br />You are turned off by graphic descriptions: -1 point<br />You like a lot science in your science-based novel: -1 point<br />You like an easy read that flows well: -2 point<br />Score: >=10 You'll love this book!. 6-9 You'll like the book but find some of it tedious. 1-5 You'll like minor parts, but wonder if it was worth it. -1 to -5 You'll dislike this book. &lt;-5 You'll hate this book.<br />I usually read trilogies after all the~~ books are published.  But I made an exception here because I love Stephenson and because I am also coincidentally reading Isaac Newton's PRINCIPIA (translation by Cohen).  Sadly, we see Newton and Leibniz in glimpses only in this book, and instead are treated to Daniel Waterhouse, the ancestor of Cryptonomicon's Lawrence Waterhouse; Jack Shaftoe, the ancestory of his Cryptonomicon counterpart; and Eliza, a former Turkish harem sex slave.  As in Cryptonomicon, we see a great genius through the~~ more limited eyes of a very bright, but not brilliant protagonist (in Quicksilver we are treated to Waterhouse's interactions with I. Newton, W. Leibniz, R. Hooke, and others of that era; in Cryptonomicon it was Alan Turing).<br />Shaftoe is initially almost just to tie plot elements together and supply some much-needed comic relief.  Eliza gives us eyes into the political machinations of Louis XIV, William of Orange, and various changing English monarchs.  You can read more about plot in other~~ reviews, and I do not wish to spoil it here, suffice to say that particularly early in this book, it seems that we are just getting a slightly humorous lecture on European history.<br />Given that I have some background knowledge on Newton, the era, the controversies involved in his theories, etc., I can honestly say that I am astonished by N.S.'s detail and accuracy.  He captures the theory, the socio-political circumstances, the religious conflicts, even I.Newton's personal issues with a~~ clarity that boggles my mind.  He even goes so far as to project somewhat on why Newton uses geometry in his Principia, rather than calculus, to prove his theories-- and it seems consistent to what I have read in Cohen's excellent book.  I can only assume that the detail regarding the other issues, and the projections N.S. makes regardng them-- revolutions galore, religious conflicts, economic issues-- is likewise as clear.  It is certainly immensely and profusely detailed.  The scenes with~~ these great minds are truly to be relished-- N.S. captures the essences of these great historical characters into believable dialogue and interactions.  How penetrating N.S. must be to make such characters real from the dry library research he must have spent thousands of hours doing!<br />But some of the detail is too profuse.  The endless political shenanigans and counter-shenanigans motivating each and every noble are a bit much for all but the true fan of European history.  Fortunately, it~~ does not all need to be understood in such detail to follow a fairly simplistic plot overall.<br />This first novel of the trilogy is scene-setting, some plot, character building, for 600 pages.  In some places it is tedious.  Some of the dialogue is entertaining, some of the character's thinking processes amusing, but N.S. does not hit his stride until after 600 pages.  The final 300 are amusing, entertaining, even thrilling.  N.S. somehow turns the delivery of a baby scene into a triumph of~~ spirit, ingenuity, and tension, for example.  In Cryptonomicon, I was laughing every other page from page one.  In Quicksilver, I chuckled a few times, and was entertained about a third of the time.<br />I am hoping that future volumes are more direct, briskly paced, and less endless detail and trivia.  Some of it is excellent for scene-setting and mood building.  I am truly grateful I do not live in 1690s England after reading this book.  But others are just tiresome and exasperating.<br />OTOH,~~ N.S. has a unique, unmatched talent.  His characters breath like real people.  You come to understand their motivations, their emotions-- like a real-life friend.  This may come about by his endless, detail-driven meandering style, and so changing one destroys the magic of the other.  But I would think he could manage with just a little less narrative.<br />Still, all in all, you must experience N.S. at the peak of his powers.  He has evolved from Snow Crash to Cryptonomicon to this, a splendid~~ insight into a revolutionary, chaotic time in our world history.

His stories have historically been fun, straight-forward entertainment.  High fantasy in the classic tradition.  Magic and warriors galore.  Likeable characters.  Good, easy reading.<br />That being said, Feist has fallen into a predictable pattern lately.  This book, King of the Foxes, contines where Talon of the Silver Hawk left off.  The protagonist is rather one-dimensional.  His motivation is revenge for the slaughter of his village/family.  Unlike other main~~ characters, such as Pug, Aruthra, and Jimmy the Hand, Tal seems to lack some charm.  Feist has attempted, I think, to inject some grittiness in this story that is ill-suited to his writing style.  Tal comes across as cardboard thin, predictable, without personality or complexity.  Feist has never been one for complexity, but he made up for that with charm and wit.  Tal has none of these things.<br />The story proceeds along what are becoming stereotypical Feist lines.  Tal, an accomplished~~ swordsman, uncovers the big bad plot that is not really what it seems.  The man Tal holds responsible for the massacre of his village is, in fact, a puppet to a much more powerful, evil, magical being.  In some ways, Tal becomes the decoy for Pug and his son, Marcus, and their cadre of powerful magicians, to address the true problem behind the obvious.<br />Usually, Feist includes clever dialogue, amusing moments, and moments of true tenderness in the storyline to add variety.  Both books in this~~ Conclave series so far have been so focused and tunnel-visioned, that it wasn't nearly as fun.  This has something to do with Talon's character, I'm sure-- he is a single-minded, focused individual with a fairly pure emotional drive.  But combine that with the fact that Talon is pretty much the only protagonist in this book (unlike the much more entertaining combo of Pug and Thomas from Magician)-- and you get a pretty single-minded-- and predictable-- book.<br />In contrast, Feist's work with~~ Wurts on the Empire series, while featuring one character: Mara of the Acoma-- was nonetheless filled with a combination of emotions, including self-doubt, revenge, love, loyalty.  Not to mention a vivid new world of exotic beauty, politics, and &quot;technology&quot;.<br />Without totally revealing what happens in this book, it's true this book finishes off what started in Talon of the Silver Hawk.  I suspect, however, that the series will continue with some of the plot elements started-- Talon gets a~~ &quot;new&quot; purpose in life, and the big bad evil is still out there.  This is similar to the SerpentWar saga.  The invasion was stuffed in book three, but there was a book four to deal with the big bad guy (or gal in that case), and finish up some things.<br />Maybe Talon is still in the evolving process.  And he seems to have, at the end of this book, found a new direction, one that might open him up as a character.  But this has clearly not been Feist's best, and IMO, he has been slipping since~~ the SerpentWar saga (which, IMO, was excellent).~h~~ Wurts on the Empire series, while featuring one character: Mara of the Acoma-- was nonetheless filled with a combination of emotions, including self-doubt, revenge, love, loyalty.

I'd written a review for Vol.2 awhile ago, but had to imply that there was a Vol.1 to be read, as well.  It's been a while, and others have already gotten to it, but I thought I'd plug in my 2 cents...<br />WONDERFUL!<br />In retrospect, there is some mystery here.  BaGua, as with many Chinese martial arts styles, is all about your instructor, your instructor's instructor, etc.. Your lineage is key.  BaGua has a very complex geneaology, stemming~~ from Dong Hai Chuan (various phonetic spellings) the legendary Grandmaster.  In fact, two key branches of BaGua (since Dong Hai Chuan only taught experienced martial artists-- most whom he purportedly defeated in combat) are those that seem very BaGua like, and those that seem Hsing-Yi-ified.  Those are my terms.  In my experience, you can take the forty or so BaGua styles, and classify them as fairly &quot;pure&quot; BaGua (circular, evasive, fine, intricate), and those that have integreated~~ significant Hsing-Yi principles-- linear, power, direct.<br />Park Bok Nam's style is more pure BaGua in terms of evasiveness, footwork, and hand-techniques.  His teacher, the legendary Lu Shue-Tien, is a bit of an unknown...  Even in this book, there is no real claim as to who taught Lu Shue-Tien.  Other sources I have speculate...<br />That being said, this book is a wonderful, detailed work that describes basic techniques-- footwork, some foot-trapping, and elementary strikes down to the~~ smallest level of biomechanics.  How to move your feet, knees, pelvis, abdoman, to generate power, for example.  In more detail than in any other book on any other style I've ever read.  Superb for anyone who is trying to understand the underlying principles of this art, or even for the advanced practitioner trying to compare this or that, or to glean insights.<br />This is not a forms book.  Park Bok Nam gives some simple palm changes that are basically qi gong postures with circle walking. ~~ It's a mechanics book.  A superb one.<br />Finally, the lineage is important.  BaGua varies significantly from style to style.  The techniques can be dramatically different, as can the mechanics at the more superficial level.  But I think from a basic concepts level, the biomechanics are all pretty much the same.  So this is an insight into one family, not all.  But I think confining it to mechanics kept it manageable, and pure.  No hullabaloo or flash.  And eminently useful.<br />Wonderful,~~ clearly written, adequate pictures (get the videos for better illustration of Park's technique).  A must for the martial artist.~~ It's a mechanics book.

This is what I've determined.  In Chinese culture, it was the essence of enlightenment to pursue numerous virtuous pursuits felt to advance one's spirit or soul.  Master Cheng fulfilled this ideal-- he strove to master calligraphy, Chinese medicine, philosophy, as well as Tai Chi, among others.<br />His 13 treatise(s) are the basis of this one man's perception of the world.  Its foundation is, of course, qi/internal development, based on the principles of Tai Chi.  But they cover a number of topics, including his perceptions on Chinese medicine, personal behavior, cosmology, Tai Chi development, and others.<br />There were approximately 3 or 4 pearls that I will take away from this book for my own internal martial arts practice, and that in alone is of inestimable value... Perhaps there is no more than that, but I keep looking for a book that delves into detail about things-- from mechanics and techniques to stages of development and evolution.  Cheng touches on these things in his treatises, but does not explore.  In the FAQ section at the end, many students' questions seem to be striving for these same details, but Cheng's answer is &quot;There is no more&quot;, it is complete.<br />That's all well and good, and it may be true.  It may be that our discovery of whatever else there is must be unique and unexplained.  But I still sought something deeper when finished with the book.  In addition, his assertions that there is &quot;no more&quot; left me skeptical because his chapters on using Eastern medicine to &quot;cure&quot; tuberculosis were clearly based on limited insight into what TB really is.  I don't think Cheng really had TB from his description.  He may have had pulmonary fibrosis from a condition resembling silicosis, but not TB.<br />That limitation is no fault of Master Cheng, but it does unfortunately color my opinion of his insights.  Is there indeed something more, just no good way to explain it or expand on it given his cultural and temporal background?  I don't know.<br />A good book, and as a classic an important one that must be read.  As much as anything, the pictures of his form were valuable.

Appropriately, this book both expanded my<br />awareness of the concept of qi, enhanced my understanding,<br />yet failed to provide a coherent, simplistic answer.<br />Before reading this book, I had come to the conclusion that<br />there really was no such thing as qi.  I was right, and I<br />was wrong.  But I feel significantly closer to true<br />understanding.<br />Highly recommended!  My only criticism is that for such a short<br />book, too much time was spent on extended quotes.  Yes, they<br />added to the text as examples, but I would also like to have<br />seen more in-depth exploration of major concepts.  If space was<br />a limitation, then I would have preferred more brief quotes, and<br />more narrative exploration.<br />This is a must read for anyone seeking to understand the concept<br />of Qi, that has yet to find the answer, or is not sure of the<br />answer.

This will ultimately bring unrealized prowess.<br />I liked how Mr. Lowenthal unpretentiously stated this, and gave examples.  But I was a little disappointed when he talked up how arduous it was for him to finally understand how to project power while his arms were completely relaxed, but then never even attempted to describe his epiphany, leaving me wondering, at least until I figure it out for myself.<br />A nice little book.  A nice little tribute to Master Cheng.	2004-03-06

As I've stated before, finding<br />English translations on any text is difficult, because Chinese<br />ideograms are themselves sometimes associated with different<br />meanings based on context, and because, especially with regards<br />to religious symbolism and internal alchemy, the symbolism can<br />be quite esoteric.<br />This book is divided into sections.  The first is Cleary's<br />direct translation.  The second is his commentary for each verse.<br />The last is an afterward regarding the &quot;technques&quot; espoused in<br />this book relevant to modern life.<br />Personally, I would have found the commentary more useful<br />integrated directly after each verse.  The translation is still<br />highly symbolic, and the commentary adds a little to<br />understanding what is trying to be said.  As it is, I found<br />myself re-reading the translation verse by verse, at the end of<br />each verse thumbing to the appropriate commentary.  I did not<br />find the direct translation so poetic that the interruptions<br />would have destroyed any aesthetic sense from reading it.  At<br />the very least, commentary at the end of each chapter would<br />have been better.<br />To a layperson like me, this book provided illumination  in<br />glimpses only.

I<br />loved Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn.  One of the few books/series<br />to ever make me cry.  Otherland just didn't do it for me.  Too<br />much.  This, his latest, The War of the Flowers, is somewhere in between.<br />First we have to take into consideration that it is one book,<br />not one book in a series.  There is one major character,<br />someone from our own 21st century world-- a down and out singer<br />with personal issues.  He gets transported into the world of<br />Faerie,an interesting interpretation of Fairyland on Tad<br />Williams' part.  I suppose that fans of Fairy-like things will<br />find his interpretations and extrapolations interesting.  But I<br />wasn't all that impressed.  Compared with the detail and<br />richness of the worlds in his other books, even Otherland<br />(Otherland's storyline didn't grab me, but his world and<br />descriptions were nice, and some of the characters were nice),<br />this one was a bit-- not shallow, just underexplained.<br />Sometimes, IMHO, Williams tends to describe so you can picture<br />something, but there isn't as much soul or substance underneath<br />as I would like.<br />The protagonist is pretty straight-forward.  He matures,<br />evolves, and becomes a better person.  The issues aren't<br />complex.<br />Neither is the plot.  The protagonist struggles to survive<br />through Fairyland, and somehow manages to triumph by a<br />combination of inspiration and coincidental timing (ie luck)<br />over impossible odds.  There is betrayal, love, and friendship,<br />but it is all understated.  The action is basically running.<br />Magic doesn't play an overt role, but is more profound than in<br />Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn.<br />A solid fantasy all in all.	2003-10-30

Interesting new world with some history, some suspense, some novel new ways of looking at things.  I didn't fall in love with this book, however.  Somehow, it came across as slightly vague.  Some of this might be intentional-- exactly what magic is, its basis, its history, even the bad malignant threat to humankind are amorphous.  There are concepts of intangibility that are discussed, explained, so you know for sure that its supposed to be insubstantial.  Then there is just plain vague.  Too many things in this book left me feeling-- what?-- it gave me a feeling of being lost and confused as opposed to mysterious.<br />This is true of many of the characters.  They lacked depth.  This is forgivable-- there are many characters, and a lot of plotlines that needed to be developed and then brought together for a climax that really does fit the bill and leave one fairly satisfied.  How much the editor had to do with this is an interesting question in my mind-- there seemed to be whole scenes missing at times, with a quick transition written to explain events.  I think Robert Jordan spends too much time writing words that accomplish nothing.  I got the sense sometimes that Keyes' just wanted to get through this book.<br />The book is gritty, and the characters are real, with realistic abilities (except where the supernatural take a direct hand).  The bad guys are bad, and supernatural, and I had a difficult time at times when one armored bad guy suddenly pulled lightning from the sky, or this supporting character did something similar without any sense that they were supernatural at all.<br />In a genre where quality writing is sometimes scarce, Keyes' is on my list of to-read.  He's not one of my favorites, but I certainly enjoyed and was entertained by this book.  I'm hoping that subsequent volumes elaborate somewhat further on the vagueness I mentioned.  This book struck me like Tad Williams' Otherworld series.  Took about 1400 pages to really start grabbing you.  Fortunately, it didn't take me as long to get through the first 500 pages as Otherworld did.o really start grabbing you.

He has a simple, direct style.  His plots are interesting, uncomplicated, good vs. evil, make you care but nothing too convoluted.  He has likeable characters that you come to know and love.<br />He's not going to win any awards for sophisticated, elegant prose, but his writing is clear and vivid and direct.  He's not going to paint any masterpieces with his descriptions, but he conveys the story well.<br />All in all, when I read Feist I expect to be entertained, to be taken on a rolicking adventure in good fun, and feel good at the end about the outcome.  I've always had a slight problem with the apparent power disparity in magic vs. sword.  The best warriors can slay 10 bad guys.  A powerful wizard can take out ten cities.  Feist does a little to correct that in this series.<br />So what I expected from Talon, Feist's most recent work, is what I got.  Enjoyable, fun.  A new, likeable good guy, the return of some favorite old supporting characters, new bad guys.  Basically a good time.  Not a lot of incredibly complex politics or plot tests.  Just a good read that goes by fast.<br />One small nitpick-- Feist is trying to be a little more gritty in this series-- there's a touch shade of darkness, evil, foreboding in this book that's slightly different than in his other novels.  It doesn't work for me with Feist's style.  Feist always had his characters face incredible odds with a heroic gallantry that I found refreshing.  Good guys were good, bad guys were bad.  The simplicity was fun. Feist tries to do a little more here, and it doesn't work quite as well.<br />All in all, a fun read.	2003-10-21

She thought about it for years according to her interviews.  She wrote the Pliocene Series as a means of introducing the reader to many of the concepts she thought might be difficult to digest  without it.  According to her, she wrote the first two books of the Pliocene Saga in like two months!  Unbelievable!<br />That being said, I thought Intervention and the Galactic Milieu series were a touch below the Pliocene.  There was less of what I loved-- vivid, textured imagery evoked by her silky smooth prose.  Despite being set in a 22nd century universe controlled by psychics, the setting of these books were more mundane than the Saga.  While some of her descriptive prose was lovely, it didn't dominate as in other books.  I almost got the sense that May felt like there was too much to convey, too much to write, without enough space.  What was planned as a Trilogy became Intervention plus Galactic Milieu. And even then there was so much to cover.<br />I also felt that for the events that changed the face of humanity, she could have come up with better antagonists.  Pliocene always had an epic sense-- this one didn't even though the fate of humanity was at stake.  I still very much enjoyed May's characters-- but somehow they lacked the soul that I was used to from her earlier works.  In fact, the only character I felt I knew as well as any of the major protagonists from Pliocene was Uncle Rogi-- and while lovable, he owns a bookstore... he has none of the angst that many of May's characters from Pliocene had that made them so dramatic.<br />Still, May is one of the best in the business, and she creates a fascinating, creative universe in Intervention-- the beginnings of the Galactic Milieu.	2003-10-10

She makes her worlds seem alive, ultra-real, and her characters are the deepest in the genre.  How she somehow managed to create so many characters of such soul in  so few pages for this series is beyond me.<br />I laughed with Aiken Drum, cried with Elizabeth Orme, sympathized with Bryan Grenfell, and trembled at Felice  Landry's rage.  Our heroes embark on escaping the servitude of the alien, psychically-powered Tanu.  The plot thickens, the action escalates, the characters evolve-- some even die, sometimes fulfilled, sometimes not.  This is space opera at its finest.<br />Even secondary characters-- certain alien Tanu that actually sympathize with enslaved human-- are touching.  You understand something of their motivations, their soul.<br />All while reading in disbelief, wondering how May writes such effortless, vivid scenes.  Her creativity is unmatched-- the world she sees must have color, sound, texture all magnified to the umpteenth degree.<br />Yes, you might need a dictionary to read some of her books.  But what joy, to learn such new, colorful words, and savor how she uses them!	2003-10-10

The breathtaking conclusion to the Saga of Pliocene Exile,<br />we are confronted by three principals-- King Aiken Drum, former misfit; Elizabeth Orme, former psychic, now ohmbudsperson of the Many Colored Land; and Marc Remillard, felled leader of a Rebellion against a 22nd century galaxtic civilizatio.<br />I cannot emphasize my admiration for May's writing.  Her style is vivid, smooth, alive.  In this book, Remillard takes center stage, the most provocative character in sci-fi.  He is Milton's fallen Lucifer-- brilliant, driven, obsessed to the point of cruelty-- ultimately noble, self-sacrificing-- in this way he is reborn<br />But don't think that May ignores her other characters.  They continue to evolve, gaining substance, soul.  I never found myself saying &quot;No, that doesn't fit&quot;-- she makes this incredibly complex work while remaining true to the personalities of her characters and the scenario she has created.<br />The tension in this book is less about epic battles with armies of thousands (although there is that here), as in Nonborn King, and more about a war of wills, manipulations of chess pieces on a board by the principals.  Somehow, the story gets still deeper, then comes to a satisfying, appropriate conclusion.<br />IMO, the best sci-fi series ever written.	2003-10-10

Julian May continues in her tradition of exotic, colorful,<br />vivid landscapes and characterizations in the Nonborn King, book three of the Saga of Pliocene Exile.  IMO, this is the best writer for descriptive, smooth prose in the business.<br />Book Three centers  on Aiken Drum, a trickster misfit  who has emerged with awesome psychic powers, and leader of a faction of Tanu-- those psychic aliens that had enslaved humanity as they traveled back through time to the Pliocene from 22nd century earth.<br />Aiken maneuvers his faction to attain dominance among the Pliocene-- there are titanic battles, politics, intrigue, nobility, and deception.  All in May's wonderfully smooth, adjective-laden writing style that is never too complex, never  cluttered, just easy-breathing wonder.<br />We are also introduced to Marc Remillard, my favorite character in sci-fi.  While Aiken is Wagner's Loki, Remillard is Milton's Lucifer.  Puissant, noble, the defeated idealist, utterly focused, driven at the expense of those he loves or loved.  A magnificent character that plays a role throughout May's later Intervention/Galactic Milieu books  as well.<br />Books One and Two set the stage, were eminently satisfying, left us begging for more.  Nonborn King delivers... An epic penultimate climax leaving you wondering how she's ever going to top it.	2003-10-10

A stunningly talented writer whose prose makes me envious.  Colorful, vibrant, textured verbiage make her worlds come to life.  This world, set 200 years in the future, features humans having colonized and exploited two of our galaxy's spiral arms--thousands of worlds.  Megacorps dominate all aspects of society-- but big business is corrupt.<br />May ups the ante in this concluding volume of the Rampart Worlds Trilogy.  The antagonist is now a xenophobic alien species secretly usurping our technology in a covert attempt to eventually overwhelm the human species and take over our worlds.  They need &quot;breathing room&quot;.<br />The tension in this one is certainly a bit higher than the other two books in the series-- the stakes are higher, and her protagonist, Asa Frost, is in dire straits when the book opens.  Still, this wasn't a page turner like a Ludlum thriller.  The twists and turns of this book were fun, tongue-in-cheek, goofy at times, with just a bit more seriousness than the first two.  I must commend May-- I never tired of Asa Frost,although all three books are written from his perspective.  Despite this, I still felt like her supporting characters were relatively undeveloped.<br />What do I mean by relatively?  Hey-- she still does a better job than  99% of sci-fi writers out there!  May is a brilliant writer, with fresh ideas and perspectives that are a joy to read!  By all means, read all her books, including this series, concluding with this finale, Sagittarius Whorl.	2003-10-09

It continues the story of a disenfranchised former cop framed by big business to keep him from uncovering their corruption.<br />Orion Arm continues the Julian May tradition of creating worlds described with vibrant adjectives that make her worlds a feast for all five senses.  Her prose is perhaps unmatched in science fiction, and it is a joy just to read her works to see how she puts together her sentences.<br />Orion Arm continues in the vein of sort of goofy, tongue-in-cheek action adventure and humorous cynicism  from rough-around-the-edges protagonist Asa Frost.  The plot thickens, becomes at once more serious and complex than in the first book.  The first one was definitely more fun than adventure-- this book adds just a bit of suspense, making it more enjoyable.  Much of the new tension comes from the shifting of emphasis from evil megacorprorations to a xenophobic alien race with ulterior designs on our galaxies-- it sets up the action for book 3.<br />All in all, I enjoyed this book a tad bit more than the first, but still rate this series slightly behind May's earlier works.  Unlike Pliocene Exile Series, where I found myself admiring May for her ability to let us come to know even secondary and tertiary characters, this series' supporting characters were somewhat superficial.  Oh, compared to most sci-fi, Ms. May's characters are all vivid and deep, but compared to her own unusually high standards-- this falls just a bit short.  Still, entertaining, imaginative a good read.	2003-10-09

May is a velvety smooth writer whose prose reads like a vivid oil painting done by a master.<br />The Many Colored Land starts off a little slow-- she introduces at least eight major characters whose stories the reader will follow throughout the Exile.  But while one is digesting what is ultimately a very complex beginning to a very complex tale, one can bathe luxuriously in the radiance of her vibrant, adjective-filled prose.  This world starts to come alive, folks!  Sight, sound, smell, touch, and soul!<br />The basis is in the Galactic Milieu-- our galaxy of the future, where more and more humans are being born with fantastic psychic powers, and all are mind-linked in a harmonious galactic mind-- well, all of those with psychic powers.  For those humans without psychic abilities, there are those that feel stifled by the growing order of progressive civilization.  Those free-spirits, radicals, criminals that just don't fit in get a choice-- mental reprogramming/rehabilitation, or exile.<br />Exile is via a one-way time machine that can send people back 6 million years to the Pliocene-- where ramapithicenes and the occasional wooly mammoth roam.<br />The Many Colored Land introduces us to the eight members of Group Green, a motley collection of the rebellious, the bored, and the depressed.  As the story progresses, May breathes life into these characters like some deity-- they live, breath, and feel.  May left me gasping at times-- &quot;That is exactly what that character would say in that situation!&quot;  I felt like I knew them like my best friends.<br />Our heroes are quickly confronted with a Pliocene dominated not by sabretooths, but by an alien hegemony with psychic powers!  They are imprisoned, enslaved, and slated for menial labor or sexual servitude or programmed breeding depending on their genetics.<br />The action is only beginning in this book-- the other three only propel this series to greater and greater heights.

Her books are always imaginative, detailed, witty, and colorful.  May is unmatched in her ability to string together sentences with multiple adjectives used in novel ways to create a world with sight, sound, texture, and soul.  Reading May is like reading good poetry-- effortless, provoking, flowing.<br />That being said, Perseus Spur, the first of the Rampart Worlds Trilogy is a different kind of book for her.  A new universe, 200 years in the future, dominated by megacorporations plotting and scheming to make a profit by exploiting the resources of our arm of the galaxy.  There are no world-smashing psychic powers or Pliocene-era ramapthicines here.  The protagonist is a former police officer, framed by the megacorps, and exiled to a tropical paradise where he has nearly drunk himself to death.  He is a quasi-cynical, what-the-heck rough-around-the-edges sort with lofty, wounded ideals set against the galactic might of big business.<br />This book has a sort of sardonic, tongue-in-cheek feel to it.  May's imagination and vision  can leave you breathless with the images she provokes, but the overall plot is pretty basic.  This is no Ludlum thriller or groundbreaking sci-fi epic a la Asimov's Foundation.  What it is is a good fun, smile at Ms. May's sense of humor and imagery, and cheer on the good guy type of book.  She also has a number of pretty interesting sci-fi ideas for the concepts-- with a strong genetic component as did her Galactic Milieu/Pliocene Exile series-- that I can appreciate.<br />The Pliocene Exile series is still my favorite from Ms. May.  This one fails to deliver the depth of character for some of the supporting players in the story that her other series did.  I feel like I understand the protagonist well, but not a lot of the others.  Still, I had a great time reading it.  Thanks, Ms. May.  How about a sequel to the Pliocene Series?

Waysun Liao is not personally known to me, but according to the sources in this book, he is an avid believer in Cheng Man Ching's perspective on Tai Chi.  I am in no position to critique one perspective or another, but my take on this book was that it was tinted significantly by Master Cheng's perspective.  That being said, I have not avidly studied Master Cheng (although I intend to read some of his/students' work), but there was a consistent underlying bias towards one way of looking that I wasn't convinced was originally intended by the \\"classics\\"authors.  I'll try to explain what I mean in the paragraphs below.<br />The first section is an abridged history of Tai Chi.  The next two chapters are on ch'i and jing, respecively.  These two chapters are nice.  They are Master Liao's (the author)insights into the concepts of ch'i and jing.  He provides some nice descriptions and definitions of what he feels these terms mean, as well as medititative approaches to trying to develop ch'i and jing.  As with the majority of books I've read, these definitions are things like \\"life energy\\", \\"internal energy\\" and \\"intrinsic energy\\"-- and the outcome after practicing his meditative technique is that you should soon \\"feel your ch'i\\".<br />Liao attempts to be more precise and detailed then that, but ultimately, as with many things, the reader is still reduced to \\"life energy\\" as the basis of all things.  His descriptions include many analogical/symbolic diagrams that are sometimes helpful, but for me, mostly added nothing-- in fact, when he attempts to use real-life analogies, it's clear that his understanding of Newtonian physics is inadequate to truly use these types of examples to try and explain what he means.  Ultimately, ch'i as the \\"energy of the universe\\" and \\"immune to the laws of time and space\\" is inadequate to the subject.<br />OTOH, his treatise on jing is interesting and informative, although still relies to heavily on his abstract definition of ch'i.  Utilizing a hammer and nail analogy left me shaking my head in dismay.  Liao does not always correlate his text with his hand-written diagrams.  I did like his explanation of shoong, or relaxation.<br />His perspective pervades his Tai Chi Classics translation.

So I looked forward to reading Vol. 2.<br />I was disappointed.  Whereas Vol. 1 was focused essentially on breathing and mediation, and gave nice descriptions, as well as step-by-step exercises to better master and understand this form of meditation, Vol.2 was scattered.  Frantzis, is an eloquent writer, so I was never bored or confused, and his stories/analogies are always amusing, albeit sometimes difficult to completely believe.<br />However his treatment of Ba Gua Circle Walking is far too basic.  Follow these footsteps and breath like in Vol. 1 is essentially what it comes down to.  At least Vol. 1 really got into what Frantzis viewed as appropriate steps in the Water Meditation process-- starting from the very basic, and getting to the somewhat advanced.  In Vol.2, Frantzis covers a broad range of topics superficially.<br />I agree that including sexual techniques was a bit misplaced.  Chia, at least, has the sense to write separate volumes when distinguishing between martial meditative and sexual qigong approaches.  How to improve your sexual sensitivity by fingering tofu--?  Come on, Kumar!<br />Vol.2 also began expounding somewhat on the esoteric, that is difficult to confirm.  Reliable friends of mine have attended Kumar's seminars-- he basically asks how many attendees are qigong instructors, then trashes and humiliates them in front of everyone else.  Not very classy.  According to my friends, he never proves his own abilities, either, merely plays mindgames.  My friends agree that Kumar has some skill and knowledge, but his arrogance shows up in his books, and this trait apparently manifests profoundly at least at the two seminars I've heard about.<br />This book is more in this vein.  He claims a lot of things, and tells a lot of stories and makes a lot of anecdotes about wonderful spiritual achievements, but these things are so \\"advanced\\" that I cannot confirm them, and wonder if I ever will.  I do think I've experienced some of the more esoteric things Frantzis talks about in Vol. 1, so you never know...

Ideograms (Chinese characters) can have different meanings in different contexts.  Combine that with the Chinese penchant for exaggerating and analogizing things, and any translation of original Chinese texts must be taken with a grain of salt.  At the very least, a deep understanding of the context is required in addition to fluency in the language.<br />For those of us with primarily Western backgrounds, Peter Ralston's book Cheng Hsin is wonderful.  He relies more on personal experience, takes quotes from the classics to support his narrative, to define what he feels is the key to understanding the internal martial arts-- specifically, effortless power.<br />Although some of his sentences are complicated, and take several readings to completely understand, this is forgivable.  Finding the precise words in English to convey his meaning is a difficult task, and Ralston does so effectively-- albeit not simply with respect to grammar.<br />What Ralston does is break down all those esoteric principles you've read and or learned from studying internal martial arts-- be it Tai Chi, Ba Gua, Hsing-I, or others-- and put them in understandable, and IMO, realistic terms.  There is no actual spirit here, or internal energy, simply awareness, understanding, consciousness, and biomechanics.  To me, a wonderful, realistic interpretation that makes sense from a Western standpoint.<br />Having ongoing formal training in this area, I can tell you that unlike other reviewers, I found this book delightful.  It corroborated all the teachings that I had gathered from my instructor and guest intructors and readings, and put it in another perspective, adding increased insight.<br />In many respects, it IS a step-by-step guidebook for developing improved structure, internal awareness-- and better yet, there is no quasi-mythical/symbolic gobbledygook to confuse you!  To native medieval Chinese, references to earth power and qi may have been intuitively obvious, but I have been trying to understand these terms from a Western point of view.  Ralston makes a great stab at it-- right or wrong-- he strips out the spiritual per se-- and gives us something to really focus on and work on.  Yes, he talks about consciousness and focus and awareness and being, but anyone who has worked in meditation or internal arts will instantly grasp what he means. Ralston does a nice job of DEFINING what he means when he uses these words.<br />When the world-famous Chinese master says to you &quot;Move your qi here...&quot; and you say... &quot;Okay, what do you mean by qi, and how exactly should I move it?&quot;  You get different answers from different masters... many high-level masters downplay qi.  Ralston eliminates that all together.  This is what he discovered, this is how he interprets it.  Fantastic.<br />Now, the only question is whether he's missing something or not...<br />A must read.  If I had my own school, this is the one book so far that I would make mandatory...ok to confuse you!

I kept reading it, hoping I would glean some insight, some guidepost,but it never happened.  This book was terrible.<br />Okay, if you're a philosophy major, maybe you'll get something from this book.  But for a man of Western science, struggling to apprehend the subtleties of higher-order Eastern martial arts, this was of no benefit to me.<br />Shi Ming asserts that we need to use Western science to more fully define Qi.  He then admits that while technology is progressing, it is still not sufficient to this need.  He implies that defining Qi scientifically will result in considerable benefit to humanity.<br />Shi Ming talks about the history of China, particularly how the various political upheavals were detrimental to the transmission of Qi understanding through the generations.<br />Shi Ming pulls out every big word he can think of, and uses them in repetitive tautological reiterative fashion, to state that the world must try and advance itself, enlighten itself.  That understanding Qi is the key to overcoming political, religious, and philosophical barriers.<br />Tidbits that I almost found useful: Shi Ming alleges that Qi is real.  That it is something beyond the \\"zone\\" that professional athletes sometimes talk about.  That it is beyond an instinctive ingraining of skills (such as Olympic boxers) from intense training.  But he never quite tells us what he thinks it really is, and he never hints at how to develop or find Qi, except to find a good instructor.<br />I'll match my education resume with anyone's.  I'm no dummy.  But I have to admit that sometimes I'll read philosophy and not even have a clue whatis being talked about.  This book was like that.  All I can tell was that Mr Shi Ming has some nice ideals for a better world, and that somehow he thinks Qi cultivation is the answer.  But Higher Martial Arts?  Too high.  We're talking about World Peace, and all I want to do is become better at internal martial arts.<br />Maybe this book would be good for that individual on the cusp of attaining enlightenment or sainthood.  I'm not close to that, so it did me no good at all.  Maybe if I reach that cusp, I'll try to re-read the book and see what I get out of it....

It is like many Mantak Chia books,detailed and well-organized.  I know that some reviewers complained about the organization, but what Chia does is give step-by-step instructions for a number of exercises.  It gets confusing when trying to digest it in totality.  Like reading a math text cover to cover.  It helps if you read a part, practice it, master it.  All of a sudden, the next chapter makes sense, and it works!<br />I think the reason why Chia does not focus more on energy is because he does that elsewhere.  He has a number of books. He's focusing on the specific techniques for this specific process-- Iron Shirt.<br />I agree that one should not practice without an instructor. But it is impossible to really learn this stuff from a book. Internal martial arts in general.  External martial arts, for that matter, too.  Meditation, qigong, it all benefits from having an instructor.  Books are ancillary materials.  As are videos.  References only, a different perspective.  Supplements.<br />Particularly for those looking at enhancing your Wu Chi posture structurally, this is a great book.  For standing meditation exercises, this is a great reference.  As for danger with packing-- I always stick with Kumar Frantzis' 70% rule... do something 70%.  As you progress, that 70% will become more and<br />more.<br />I particularly liked the way Chia mechanistically describes what to do step-by-step.  When your instructor says, work on your chi belt and you stare and say-- how?  Then your instructor says, feel this, now do it!  And you say-- that's really cool, but I'm still not sure how to do it-- Chia gives you a roadmap.  Or even if your instructor tells you how, Chia gives you a roadmap to compare with.<br />As for who is right/wrong, where Iron Shirt really came from, what preliminary exercises should go with this or that-- I think there are many paths to any one goal.  This is one.  There are others.  Now go find the one that gets you where you want to go.<br />I'd recommend this book for those who are still walking the path.  For those who've reached the end of their journey, why'd you buy the book in the first place?This is one.  There are others.

Although this book didn't teach me much, it did confirm<br />a vast amount of information that my Tai Chi instructor<br />has been trying to pass onto me.  It's nice to get a second opinion!<br />For those who took a Tai Chi class at the YMCA or community<br />college and aren't sure whether you got legitimate instruction<br />in traditional Tai Chi concepts or not, this is a great book to<br />find out with!  For beginners looking for a good teacher, this<br />is a good guide.  For experienced practitioners, it seems more a review, but I picked up a pearl or two, and as we all know, sometimes you can attend a weekend seminar for just one new insight!<br />Looking at it scientifically, Chia very effectively describes<br />what I have been taught is the proper way to practice Tai Chi.<br />How to hold the various parts of your body, where force/qi<br />should be exerted, how to think about your internal structure or<br />posture when practicing Tai Chi.  From what I can tell, many people who study Tai Chi do not learn these fundamental concepts (do not confuse fundamental with easy-- these concepts are easy to read, but are difficult to practice).<br />Chia gives general principles first.  Body structure, breathing, meditation/qi circulation practices.  This is the best part of the book.  He then describes several different ways to practice Tai Chi, focusing on different elements each time.  This is so true!  There is so much to perfect in Tai Chi, it's almost impossible to work on all of them at the same time!  You pick one element, practice it until you get it better, then pick another... and on and on.  Then Chia gives specifics for individual postures.  However...<br />Chia gives a very short sequence-- a Tai Chi Qigong form that is quite simple, so that you can concentrate more on structure, qi meditation, and less on memorizing the sequence of postures.  The form is essentially Yang family style in terms of the postures/movements presented.  Unfortunately, this cuts out many postures you might find even in the Yang Short (24 movement) Form, so you don't get Chia's interpretation for structure for a lot of the classic, well-known postures found in the short form.  That's unfortunate, because reading his description of the individual movements was quite helpful, and reading his decription for all the movements would make this a better, more comprehensive book.  Based on his catalog, it seems Chia practices the Yang long form or a variant thereof.  How about a book, Mr. Chia?<br />Overall, a nice book that I will re-read and refer to as I continue to progress in my practice.  Highly recommended!movements presented.

It took me about a year to do so and<br />to get a good sense practicing what it preaches.  As with many of us, I seek not Enlightenment (yet), I seek to understand qigong.  What is qi?  Specifically.  As a Western scientist, I want to know what qi is/does.  Is it physiologic?  Is it truly spiritual?  Psychological?  A mixture?  What I do know is that it is not something that someone can teach, or prove/disprove.  Once I find the answer, I can have that answer only for myself.<br />That being said, this book by Mantak Chia is an extremely long, comprehensive, step-by-step guidebook on establishing the Microcosmic Orbit through a series of meditation practices ranging from the beginning to the advanced.  Some reviewers are arguing that it is right/wrong, that imagery is right/wrong (let me guess, you're from the Kumar Frantzis camp, right?)-- well I'm here to tell you that I'm simply looking for what works.  I don't care about right/wrong.  Does it work for me?  Chia goes on to explain that eventually, you can dispense with such ancillary tools as focusing on the breath, or imagery, or others, but in the beginning, they help facilitate mastery.<br />This was a great book.  A nice roadmap of things to try.  I've been trying now for awhile, and I believe I am feeling my microcosmic orbit, the energies that Chia describes from the earth and cosmic forces.  I have even begun experiencing, ironically, what seems very much like the \\"mindstream\\" described by BK Frantzis in his Water Meditation Books (which I have also reviewed), by using some of Chia's techniques.  Ironical, eh?<br />So far, I have gathered together an eclectic sequence that WORKS FOR ME.  This is a great source of information for meditation techniques.  I have adapted some from Frantzis, as well as from translations from Cleary and others.  On top of formal instruction in regular classwork.<br />I doubt I'll use it all, but for any of you out there looking for at least one roadmap, this is a good one, IMO.  I think there are many paths to this journey.  This is one path.  I will probably walk many paths before espousing a route of my own...is is a good one, IMO.

I also own two of the tapes that go along with it. I'd agree with other reviews-- as comprehensive a history and lineage tree as you're likely to find (still incomplete, however, and some errors in lineage, too, but it's an impossible task). The forms as demonstrated in the video have a WuShu flavor to them, and the Eight Palms depicted seems to bear considerable resemblance to WuDang Ba Gua technique-wise and energy-wise, although the sequence appears out of order.  Sequence and technique-wise, they strongly resemble Original Palms from Fu Family, but the energy of them in the video is WuShu.<br />I'd also agree with the opinons about applications-- too simple, pictures scattered about. Nice fundamental descriptions of movements in the form, but not a lot about internal work or energy mechanics-- the more advanced concepts inherent in the forms.<br />The translations of classic Chinese texts are invaluable-- but I'd like to point out to San Angelo, TX that a translation of \\"Sun Lu Tang's Study of Bu Gua Zhang\\" is available from Joseph Crandell's Smiling Tiger Publications, sold online at many internal martial arts websites.<br />Nice overview of Ba Gua, with a beginning, intermediate, and weapons form to demonstrate flavor.

It presented a wonderful history and philosophical background for Hsing-Han Liu's Ba Gua, but the palms shown were the simplest levels (predominately qi gung), the applications were rudimentary (perhaps even watered down), and the mechanics simplistic.  For a book that started to emphasize energy, proceeded to walking qi gung palms, a more appropriate finale would have been more sophisticated energy applications and/or development.  Real insights from this incredibly experienced Ba Gua master would have been nice, and invaluable.	2003-03-24

Readers are better off buying the first volume of his water meditation series.  This book covers basic dissolving ideas, some interesting stretches/exercises, and a zillion points throughout our qi body to direct our dissolving efforts.  It's a nice, simple introduction.  But only experts are going to memorize every point, and Mantak Chia does a better job at going through the points and explaining WHY.  The stretches and exercises are interesting, good for the beginner, but more directed at physical relaxation in a way than energy development.  That's not exactly accurate, but it's the best way I can think of to describe what I feel when trying them.  Perhaps I'm just not advanced enough to understand.  But for pure energy/biomechanics, which is what I'm into, this book didn't really strike me as useful.<br />OTOH, with respect to my own meditation practices, I usually begin with Chia's Inner Smile, then Frantzis' dissolving techniques as outlines in this book.  Breathing, as in Frantzis' Water Mediation book (Vol. 1) is part of what I do throughout-- and most useful for understanding the breathing process for any activity-- meditation, Tai Chi, whatever.  Finally, I do Chia's Microcosmic Orbit, and beginning to use his Fusion of Five Elements.  It's been interesting so far.	2003-03-24

If you're looking for one man's opinion about a dozen different martial arts systems, this is a good book.  This is Kumar Frantzis' biography, essentially, wherein he recounts his most interesting experiences.  It is difficult to validate some of the more esoteric, spiritual accountings, because this is not a technique book, not a secrets book, not a how-to book.  While Frantzis is a very clear writer, some of the arrogance I hear about from several independent sources who have gone to his seminars seeps through.  Especially the way he trounces on some martial arts styles that &quot;lack&quot; this or that.  All in all, a good read.  But it's more a story than anything else.  If that's what you want, it's entertaining and you can choose to believe or not...	2003-03-24

A wonderful, intricately written, detailed book describing the fundamentals of Ba Gua training. Emphasis is on the complex biomechanics behind Ba Gua stepping, striking, and training methods, including introductory chi kung. This is not a book describing Master Park's Ba Gua Palms or advanced forms, but it is a DETAILED description of fundamental techniques appropriate as a learning aid for the beginning or intermediate Ba Gua student.<br />Along with Vol. 1, Mr. Miller and Master Park take the reader through step-by-step descriptions of body motions for various strikes, stepping techniques, circle walking, and basic chi kung. Especially valuable in my opinion were the detailed descriptions of the strikes-- concentrating on the all-important pelvis and trunk as the generators of power.<br />For the intermediate-advanced student, there is not enough (in my opinion) description or discussion of body structural alignments, power generation while moving, or combat theory. I also would have liked to see sample lesson outlines-- typical training progression over a ten year period, for example.

I was chortling with amusement practically every other page-- Stephenson's cynical, incisive editorial adds wonderful flavor.  The utilization of Lawrence Waterhouse, a brilliant but nearly idiot-savant-like mathematician, to characterize a story surrounding the role code-breaking played during World War II was inspired, and Stephenson portrays Waterhouse intricately and magnificently.  I found myself feeling like I was living behind Waterhouse's eyes while reading-- a wonderful way to keep what is obviously intended to be a particularly brilliant character more down to the level of the book's readers.  I loved this character!  I wanted more of this character and his interactions with Alan Turing.<br />Some nit-picky complaints: 1) the book was clearly the first of a series, and the end, while appropriate to the storyline, was a little anti-climactic given the superlative job done in the body of this work.  2) the math is far too rudimentary for mathematicians of the calibre of the characters, but I understand why this may have been done, 3) there is a little too much dwell-time on bodily fluids for my taste.<br />Nonetheless, I can't wait for the sequel!
