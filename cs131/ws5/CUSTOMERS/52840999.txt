US	52840999	R2X6FOAB1FGSF	0930289528	333940954	V for Vendetta	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Cruel Brittannia	At its heart, \\"V for Vendetta\\" is about two very similar men, separated and drawn into a bloody duel to the death, and yet bound together by an umbilicus called the Fate Computer, each willing to sacrifice anything and everything for an idea.<br /><br />In this regard, \\"V for Vendetta\\" is a tale about cruelly separated twins, a kind of \\"Prince and the Pauper\\" for the Orwellian post-nuclear age.<br /><br />The men? The anonymous terrorist firebrand 'V', cloaked and booted and features masked in the costume of Guy Fawkes, the infamous 17th century terrorist who plotted, in vain, to blow up Parliament.<br /><br />On the other side of the looking glass, the titular 'Head' of a post-apocalyptic, riot-ravaged England's fascist government, Adam Susan, a man buoyed to power on the shoulders of the Norsefire brigades that brought order out of chaos in the final days of a tottering, damned British Empire.<br /><br />Both men are extremists in their fashion: willing to kill for their ideals: one for pure, unfettered, anarchic Liberty, the other for Order.<br /><br />Both offer ideas they will kill and maim and ruin for.<br /><br />Both embody and enshrine a Grave Lady as the incarnation of their veneration: both of these Dark Ladies, Lady Justice, and Lady Fate, have betrayed their idealistic lovers, in fashions that will not, until late in the tale, become apparent in scope or nastiness.<br /><br />Is it not startling, not dreadful, the extent to which we Men, mere brutes in clothes, will draw daggers and plunge them bloodily deep for our mistresses, our Despot, tyrant Ideas?<br /><br />It is best, I think, to leave you only the barest of essentials as to the nature of \\"V for Vendetta\\", because you're best to experience the cold grue of our rooftop bomb-thrower for yourself, with no preconceived ideas.<br /><br />Know this: the World of the 20th century has ended. It has boiled over, and burned away. The Cold War flared hot: the missiles traveled up over the Poles, crossed, rained down on the adversaries. The American silos in Britain, long protested, had been rendered toothless, the missiles moved off British soil: and so Britain was spared, while Europe died.<br /><br />In this cold, guttering world of Death and brutality, this charnel house London that lies prostrate beneath the blackened spires of Westminster, is it not too difficult to conclude that the Dead are the lucky ones?<br /><br />The story is simple and stark: that the graphics and colors by David Lloyd are comparatively crude (by the standards of Moore's \\"Watchmen\\", which I read immediately before \\"V\\") only enhance the feral, desperate quality of this brave new world. The chary illustrations and the bleeding colors only underscore a sense of wan desperation, of brutal plans drawing to a close, of beauty profaned and lost.<br /><br />This is all you should know: young Evey is filched from the deadly clutches of the Head's sadistic Fingermen, seconds after her bumbling attempts at an assignation go horribly wrong---filched from their clutches into the chordite-lined 17th century gloves of \\"V\\", a brooding vigilante who stalks the chimney pots of this Dead New London, spinning out couplets, unleashing death and destruction.<br /><br />She survives, and regains her health, in the confines of his lair, and becomes willing---but uncomprehending---accomplice to his war against Adam Susan's 'tyranny'.<br /><br />The devilish brilliance of Alan Moore's \\"V for Vendetta\\" is that Moore never forces us to choose sides. Granted, we are given very little of the Disloyal Opposition's view, while by contrast we are bathed in the ambivalent, enigmatic world of V's Shadow Gallery.<br /><br />Both V and Susan promise liberation: one from the shackles of tyranny, the other from the jaws of disorder. Susan gives us shadow-men pounding on your door at 3 in the morning, anonymous death by truncheon out behind the chemical shed: V gives us terrorist bombings and enlightenment through torture?<br /><br />How can we choose? And what greater horror, really, is concealed behind the Mask?<br /><br />JSG	2005-10-01

In the forest primeval, that meant with teeth and claws; then spear and sword, catapult and blackpowder rifle.<br /><br />And so we tread fearfully upon the stage of the Present: the Curtain is raised, the stagelights turned up, the audience restless, shifting and murming and coughing out in the Dark. The first act of this play---\\"Watchmen\\"---will literally be a highdive to the pavement, performed, most appropriately, by a player known as The Comedian.<br /><br />It's a real showstopper.<br /><br />It is the Present: October 12th, 1985. Nixon is still in the White House, a white-hot popular four-termer and still as paranoid crazy as a hungry sewer rat; Man is still red in tooth and claw. And he still hungers for the blood of his fellow; but this time, he fights with nuclear-tipped ICBMs. The Doomsday clock stands at 5 to Midnight, and the Hour is far later than we think.<br /><br />At its core, it is a very simple tale, as the best tales usually are: it is a murder mystery.<br /><br />The calculating subversive brilliance of Alan Moore's legendary \\"Watchmen\\" is that it takes the notion of the superhero---masked avenger of Justice and the American Way---and inverts it.<br /><br />Case in point here: what is the use of a costumed crime-fighter, dedicated to protecting Man against thugs and robbers and supervillains, when Mankind itself is on the chopping block? What's the good of a cape, a mask, and a stealthy Owlship---or all the money and acumen in the world---when the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are about to ride out, led by nuclear missiles arcing up over the poles?<br /><br />And to make things a little stranger: why now, after all these years, and when Humanity is on the verge of extinction, is someone murdering the old crimefighters?<br /><br />And so we begin, with an entry from Rorschach's diary as that most troubled and cannily paranoid of crimefighters puzzles his way into he mystery of who would have beaten the life out of the Comedian, then flung him through his plate glass apartment window to do a belly flop on the hardtop hundreds of feet below. That thread weaves its way through the lives of Watchmen's heroes, old and new, flitting back and forth between the seemingly more innocent Golden Age and back again into the Darker present.<br /><br />And maybe that's why \\"Watchmen\\" serves up such a shock: it delivers us into a mythology and a world already created. There is a backstory here, just as established and confident by its lights as that of Batman, Superman, or Spider-Man, yet seamier, more rueful, more flawed. Infinitely human.<br /><br />Initially we are on the outside looking in: into a world where the elderly crimefighters and their young successors have lost their government sanction and move into early retirement, where the brutal, anarchic knot-tops rule the streets while pundits chatter nervously about Nuclear Brinksmanship, a twilight world of regret and loss and nostalgia, where the old Night-Owl rents a pre-war apartment over his auto-garage while his former arch-nemesis Moloch the Magician rots from cancer a few blocks away.<br /><br />We don't stay outside long. Moore is a genius when it comes to pacing: we arc in deep and long on Watchmen's central characters as they come to terms with their own demons and the central mystery of the story. Rorschach, mind whirling behind its living mask; the new Night-Owl Dan Dreiberg, awash in a paunchy middle-age but compelled by events to something more.<br /><br />Or Laurie Juspeczyk, the new Silk Spectre, increasingly unhappy with her lover Dr. Manhattan (less human by the day and reeling from a vicious PR attack) and fearful of turning into her vain and lonely mother. And finally Adrian Veidt, the vaunted superhero Ozymandias and now globe-trotting billionaire and business tycoon, the \\"smartest man in the world\\".<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" is a wry concoction of its times, insanely idiosyncratic, though it is not hard to imagine it conjured up today in our own troubled age: there is the looming threat of nuclear annihilation, mankind poised on the brink of apocalypse, menaced by the two tribes of the USA and the USSR, each on the verge.<br /><br />There is the notion of superhero as plaything of his times, with the exception of the 'freak' Doctor Manhattan, girded for war by an eager Pentagon, more superweapon than superhero.<br /><br />And there is the omnipresent question central to those who man the lonely ramparts of civilization against savagery, illustrated by the juxtaposition of the pulpily gory \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\", with its desperate, inventive, deeply moral hero transformed into a beast by the hellscape through which he must venture to save his imperiled family---an echo of the \\"Quis Custodiet\\" implied by the title.<br /><br />This is rich, heady, deliciously vorpal stuff, beautifully mounted with rich trappings and sumptuous depth of plot and character. Though I guessed the author behind the mystery early on---it's really a question of asking 'who gains?'---the question Moore is fascinated with---that of, what will save us from ourselves?---and the answer he comes up with, and the means by which he illustrates this little dilemma, are so mesmerizing, so gorgeous, such a feast of malice and high adventure and nostalgia and regret, that \\"Watchmen\\" deserves its rightful place in the pantheon of great art.<br /><br />JSGthing more.<br /><br />Or Laurie Juspeczyk, the new Silk Spectre, increasingly unhappy with her lover Dr. Manhattan (less human by the day and reeling from a vicious PR attack) and fearful of turning into her vain and lonely mother.

Fukuyama, writing as the ramparts of the Soviet Union collapsed, contended that \\"history\\"---defined as the chronicle of deadly clashes between Power and Creed---had ended. The Winners: Western Liberal Democracy & Western Liberal Economics.<br /><br />Not so fast, warns Huntington.<br /><br />Just as the diplomacy of the 19th century was stoked by multi-polar Great Power politics---with each of the Great Powers, no single one capable of individual dominion---played their enemies off against one another; just as the mid to late 20th century served as the silent, icy cold battlefield for a global chess game between the USSR and the USA;---so too will the first quarter of the 21st century see the rise of confict, consensus, and cooperation built on the bedrock of civilizational ties.<br /><br />The spoils of war haven't changed, according to Huntington: they are still riches, and resources, and citizens, and territory. But the players, and their motivations, have changed: the motivating question of the age is no longer \\"which side are you on\\", as it was in the age in which Adam Smith duelled Karl Marx, but rather \\"who are you?\\".<br /><br />Huntington sees the future of geopolitical coflict---and combat---boiling up from what he calls \\"Fault Line Wars\\", bubbling up from the world's low-intensity warzones, defined as the places where one culture meets another: a close encounter of the deadliest kind, with the potential to draw in first regional, and then civilizational, allies.<br /><br />It's worth noting who Huntington sees as the major flag-bearers of global civilizations. They are: The West (defined principally as the United States and Western and Central Europe), founded on the primacy of man, rule of Law, checks and balances to state power, and free market economics; Orthodoxy (The former Soviet Union and its Russian and Greek Orthodox satellites and fellow travelers), founded on obedience to State power.<br /><br />Then there is Islam, a rising, powerful movement sweeping Asia and Africa in its religious fervor, currently without a core state but nonetheless dangerous in its volatility and chaos; Sinic, comprised chiefly of China but spreading out among China's Confucian fellow travelers and dependencies; Japanese, consisting of Japan itself; and Hindu, consisting of India and its satellites.<br /><br />In Huntington's analysis---for good or ill---South America and Africa get short shrift, the former being an appendage of the West, the latter sliced up between Islamic domination and demographic apocalypse (though the future status of South Africa---which, with a little luck and leadership moxie, could constitute the core state of an African civilization---could make all the difference).<br /><br />Now: it is unfair to boil down Huntington's thesis; far better for you to encounter it, to wrestle with it, on is own terms. Huntington's writing style is certainly a challenge, but grappling with it---it is not so much dull as mechanically precise---serves as its own reward. It is to Huntington's credit to say that while not every passage excites, or stirs the blood---every single word serves a purpose.<br /><br />The purpose, as it turns out, is a warning beacon to our anesthetized elites, who still labor under the delusion that American values and virtues and creeds are universal, and that a rival civilization merely needs to take enough \\"Democracy Poppers\\" down the hatch (with a glass of water, perhaps) to become a happy, unwitting toady to Western values, whatever those are these days.<br /><br />That is adangerous attitude: our blood enemies now indulge in the trappings of Western civilization, wear bluejeans, listen to gangsta rap, and communicate with each other via cellphone, even while plotting the vilest atrocities they intend to carry out in the guts of western cities.<br /><br />Huntington makes a solid, compelling case, and it is depressing to look on \\"The Clash\\" as prophecy, though certainly it owes more to prophecy than to jeremiad. It was written well before 9/11, yet the Devils of which it warns now jeer at us in our daily headlines. It warns that the single most dangerous thing the West can do is to intervene militarily in the affairs of another civilization, and yet even now we attempt to graft the alien construct of representative democracy in the very guts of what was ancient Babylon, with bloody results.And there is little here to cheer the Western blood.<br /><br />Our universalist delusions are just as deadly to our security as our PC multicultural self-hatred, warns Huntington: in the last 20 years, it can no longer be claimed that English is the 'lingua franca' of the world: more people on Earth speak Chinese than English. Nor is demographics on our side: the birthrates in Islamic, Hindic, and Sinese civilizations are exploding, coupled by an economic fervency on the part of Asian countries: by contrast, the West is merely replacing itself, if that. And with the cards on the table, it appears that if Europe has a future, it is an Islamic one.<br /><br />Huntington moves from the diagnostic to the prescriptive: if the West is to survive, it must circle up around that which makes it distinct, and form up its alliances with its civilizational partners, while reaching out to those civilizations not immediately hostile to it---Japan, India, and the Orthodox East.<br /><br />Seen in the context of the gloomy, confused, tumultuous days before 9/11, \\"The Clash of Civilizations\\" is Prophecy.

Kudos as well to Charlie Adlard, WD's illustrator who took on the unenviable role, in Volume 2, of replacing initial artist Tony Moore.<br /><br />It is to Adlard's supreme credit that his panels have approached the sumptuous level of detail and shadowplay that characterized Moore's initial efforts, throwing enough visual Crawling Kingsnake creepiness into \\"Safety Behind Bars\\" that Adlard deserves the ultimate compliment: he's making me not miss Tony Moore all that much.<br /><br />The ruined world through which Rick and his companions travel is sick, haunted, blighted and deadly, but Kirkman and Adlard have made it brutally, addictively compelling, being as miserly as they can be with plot-twists and mysteries, while keeping the story's edge sharp enough to keep me coming.<br /><br />Eat up.<br /><br />JSGcharacterized Moore's initial efforts, throwing enough visual Crawling Kingsnake creepiness into \\"Safety Behind Bars\\" that Adlard deserves the ultimate compliment: he's making me not miss Tony Moore all that much.  <br /> <br />The ruined world through which Rick and his companions travel is sick, haunted, blighted and deadly, but Kirkman and Adlard have made it brutally, addictively compelling, being as miserly as they can be with plot-twists and mysteries, while keeping the story's edge sharp enough to keep me coming.  <br /> <br />Eat up. <br /> <br />JSG	2005-09-17

In the ancient world, the Romans, launching their civilization into war, carried out a simple but meaningful ritual: the temple priests opened wide the portals of the Temple of Mars, the War God---left them opened wide to signify the spirit of War unleashed on Rome's foe, a God of Battle red in tooth and claw.<br /><br />Simple. Brutal. Symbolically powerful. Effective. The Ancients were onto something.<br /><br />Times change. After having lived through one of the most ferocious and deadly centuries in our planet's history, humanity remains furiously optimistic and convinced of a new golden age of peace and globalism.<br /><br />After the end of the Cold War, so we're told, man's nature has changed, or can be changed with education and international relief aid, sparing humanity from fruitless war and suffering. Even the economic and financial theories sweeping the nineties and thriving during the Tech Bubble confirmed this astounding new liberation from the shackles of genetics: we had now emancipated ourselves from the Business Cycle, all Hail the New Economy!<br /><br />Indeed, the breathtaking speed of technological advances only served to heighten this sense of a world in flux. True, humanity is on the threshold of a marvellous age in technolocal innovation and revolution, and we may very well be the first generation in human history to control not only the definition of longevity, but its quality as well---to say nothing of the growing power to define, and to alter, the very notion of what it means to be human.<br /><br />Not so, according to Robert Kaplan, whose gem of a book \\"Warrior Politics\\" suggests that Ecclesiastes may have had a better bead on the future than Francis Fukuyama and Bill Clinton: there is nothing new under the sun.<br /><br />Kaplan's marvellous little tome \\"Warrior Politics\\" comes as a blast of icy water on our assumption of our modernism, and the book's first chapter is appropriately entitled \\"There is no Modern World\\".<br /><br />Kaplan cautions that this distinction between the 'ancient' and 'modern' world is an artificial and potentially dangerous one; to Kaplan, the age in which we live, though more technologically proficient than ages past, is no different from any other time in human history, and can be perceived and dealt with by distilling and using the wisdom of ancient (and not so ancient) political and military philosophers from Greece, China, and Rome.<br /><br />To that end, Kaplan has divided \\"Warrior Politics\\" into chapters that distill the wisdom of political and military theorists like Sun-Tzu, Thucydides, Clausewitz, Machiavelli, Livy, and Churchill, and succinctly and deftly apply their experiences and philosophies to modern conflict. The analysis spent on each philosopher is brief, but in the brevity the casual reader gains precious insight into the unchanging nature of human events, and the experienced reader may view a Machiavelli or Churchill in an entirely new fashion.<br /><br />According to Kaplan, human nature has not changed. Man is still ambitious, avaricious, and greedy, and tyrants and belligerents eager to enslave their fellow man or seize precious resources will be checked only with force, prudently and intelligently applied. Diplomacy, harsh words in international bodies and in Alpine peace conferences, and appeals to human dignity are all well and good, but only if those velvet words are undergirded by steel and force of arms.<br /><br />Kaplan buttresses his use of the military philosophers with some social theorists as well, including Hobbes, Malthus, and Immanuel Kant, and emphasizing that a Kantian utopia where all men are viewed as \\"ends in themselves\\" may be desirable, but highly impractical. \\"Utopia\\", after all means \\"no place.\\"<br /><br />Finally, Kaplan ends this delicious and imminently readable little book on an eccentric note: he suggests the Roman emperor Tiberius as a model for governmental stability. For all his later cruelty, Tiberius maintained the borders of Empire, eschewed costly conflicts, and left the coffers of Rome richer than when he first succeeded Augustus.<br /><br />The synthesis of Kaplan's book can be viewed through the gimlet eye of his final chapter: global governance requires global stability, and order is best fostered through a cold-eyed, realistic, and pragmatic view of human affairs.<br /><br />Why a pagan ethos? Because the pagan philosophers saw human affairs as they were (those Pagan gods were hardly idealizations, but earthy creatures with desires and furies as human as their adherents), whereas Christians saw humans as they should be.<br /><br />But in the real world, we can ill afford to have our policy guided by good intentions. And \\"Warrior Politics\\" ends with a coda: the wars we fight in the future may be with warriors, not soldiers. The excellent chapter on Achilles and Troy is instructive, in that it warns of a new class of economically disenfranchised young men (particularly in the Arab world) who give themselves over to the \\"glory of bloodlust\\", finding meaning and importance through martyrdom, terror, and chaos.<br /><br />Santayana warned that those who are ignorant of history are condemned to repeat it; in the wake of 9/11, that warning takes on considerably more ominous significance.<br /><br />Kaplan's excellent book is a thoughtful and well-paced anodyne to our own short-sighted modernity, and a roaringly good read.<br /><br />JSGr cruelty, Tiberius maintained the borders of Empire, eschewed costly conflicts, and left the coffers of Rome richer than when he first succeeded Augustus.  <br /> <br />The synthesis of Kaplan's book can be viewed through the gimlet eye of his final chapter: global governance requires global stability, and order is best fostered through a cold-eyed, realistic, and pragmatic view of human affairs.  <br /> <br />Why a pagan ethos?

Compelling. Breathtaking. Horrifying. It is a remarkably deft, cogent, pithy little sorcerous book from the Master of \\"Big Idea\\" science fiction, so gripping and lucidly written that it will take about three hours to read through it, and three years to think through its implications.<br /><br />Bear's anti-hero is the socially inept but staggeringly brilliant Vergil Ulam, a cellular biologist who makes a startling discovery with genetically modified human leukocytes (white blood cells Ulam has been tampering with), attempts to contact a rival genetic researcher, gets caught, and promptly finds himself out of a job and---more importantly---out of a laboratory.<br /><br />With a discovery in hand that could catapult him to the forefront of the field of nanotechnology (the science of creating molecular-level machines that are capable of self-replication), what's a Mad Scientist to do?<br /><br />He injects himself with the little nanites, of course, and then goes out for a night on the town.<br /><br />Greg Bear is a consummately gifted science fiction thinker who typically sacrifices character development, plot, and pacing to the more visceral and esoteric ramifications of the science at the core of his stories. \\"Blood Music\\", then, is even more of a rare gem, a book in which Bear's scientific acumen and literary craftsmanship come together.<br /><br />In the first few chapters, \\"Blood Music\\" takes on the pace and grue of a horror novel. At first the nanites in Ulam's body do nothing, and the scientist suspects they've been consumed and destroyed; then it becomes apparent that the modified leukocytes are reinventing Ulam, improving him, making benign little modifications: restoring his eyesight overnight, improving his stamina, and tucking his spine under a sheath of flesh (the better to protect it, of course).<br /><br />What's the harm?

The Devil!<br /><br />That's the Deep, Dark, shadow-haunted question, which reeks of sulphur and brimstone, into which erstwhile publicist and intellectual romper-stomper Howard Bloom takes a merry spelunk.<br /><br />Bloom, former PR generalissimo and uber-strategoi for pop-culture uber-titans Prince, Michael Jackson, Billy Idol, and Run-DMC, has brewed up a brilliant, acid, caustic, but constantly engaging and entertaining little read in \\"The Lucifer Principle\\". It's a deft, dense, and wickedly ripping yarn you can read on the course of a Red Eye from Logan to LAX, and be engaged all the way, and between its covers---given heft by a forest of footnotes---Bloom ponders a singular question:<br /><br />Where does Evil come from?<br /><br />It's no idle question: it confounded the Ancients, addled theologians, fired the brains of Popes, Imams, and mountain Holy Men alike, and has set off revolutions, Crusades, Holy Wars, and Inquisitions.<br /><br />Is it Nurture or Nature, Communism or Capitalism, the Devil or the Deep Blue Sea that takes a thinking ape who can dream of peace and yet sharpens a stick, or thrusts it into his neighbor's guts, or sacks all of the cities of the Northern Steppe and salts the ground on which they stand, or stacks the skulls of his countrymen? Or for that matter, imbues him with a frenzy to set off a bomb in a crowded shopping plaza, or flick the switch that shifts Defcon 1 into blazing, thermonuclear apotheosis?<br /><br />Bloom's thesis this: the Devil is holed up in every single one of us. The desire to brutalize, murder, pillage and destroy, to revel in the weeping of the Enemy's women---all of that \\"evolved apes behaving badly\\" stuff---is literally hard-wired into our very genetic guts. It's what binds us into evolution, advances are flag and standard, sews our seeds into the next generation.<br /><br />It's true: neither Angels nor Beasts, Men can dream up Heaven; but they're mostly capable of living out Hell. The blood-drench 20th century provides all the backup Bloom needs for that, and our young 21st century is already making up for lost time in stuffing the carnage of one hundred years into its first decade.<br /><br />At its foundation, Bloom's thesis is essentially Social Darwinism: each organism competes for limited resources, food, shelter, sex. But Bloom takes one step beyond into heresy: it is not just individual competition that drives evolution, but social competition. We are like single cells in that respect, welded into competing social organisms, struggling 'superbeasts'.<br /><br />Bloom breaks his theoretical napalm out into five key ideas:<br /><br />1)Competition & the Self-Replicators: like semiconductor and cell phones, Nature revels in throwing together chunks of biomass and spitting out new organisms---all in the name of Evolution. Those little self-replicators are you and me, and we're totally, astonishingly cheap and utterly expendable.<br /><br />2)Superbeast! We're social creatures: no \\"The Man in Black fled into the Desert, and the Gunslinger followed him\\" here, children---we're joiners. We're the unsung gladiators of a massive arena battle between macro-organisms larger than ourselves.<br /><br />3) The Meme: ideas have consquences---one of which is that in just a million years, they've managed to outpace genes in organizing disparate flesh and welding it into a force for global dominion.<br /><br />4) The Neural Net: Memes ride the tide of a gargantuan global learning machine.<br /><br />5) The Pecking Order: It's lonely at the top, because everybody is trying to get there. And since no super-organism is clawing away for Downward mobility, something's gotta give. That's going to be *your* place at the table, pilgrim.<br /><br />Half the fun of \\"The Lucifer Principle\\" is in the getting there, so I won't spoil your first encounter with Bloom. Suffice it to say that binds the sinews of his theory together with tasty junkets to the jungle fastness of the Yanomamo, the \\"Fierce People\\" of the Amazon who put a premium on wife-beating and savagery, to the war camps of gorillas and chimpanzees, to a hunt for capitalist rotters in the dark dungeons of China's Cultural Revolution, to the parliament of Victorian England and the Congress of Superpower America, both shambling along a trail of tears branded 'good intentions'.<br /><br />This is a thick, rich, rollicking read, certainly not orthodox, but all the more prickly and provocative for it. Believe or skewer, you'll be hard pressed to forget \\"The Lucifer Principle\\".<br /><br />The Devil, after all, is in the details.<br /><br />JSGyour first encounter with Bloom.

You just want to bury yourself under the ground, crawl down into sweet dark deep oblivion, sleep for two hundred years---or two thousand?<br /><br />In Alex Ross's and Mark Waid's \\"Kingdom Come\\", Superman has done just that. The World's 'oldest Boy Scout' has doffed his mantle as Metropolis's protector, and retired to his arctic Fortress of Solitude. There he uses technology to conjure up the pasturefields and corn as high as an elephant's eye of his \\"boyhood\\" Kansas. Where he can idle his time away, concentrate on the things that matter. Like Routine. Like Sanity.<br /><br />Superman hasn't changed, but the world around him has. Jaded, faded, and pierced, it wants its superhero protectors more ruthless, more brutal, more exciting than the spit-curled shiny-locked Code Against Killing batch of the naïve fifties: it wants super-warriors trained and ready to slaughter those who threaten society.<br /><br />Mankind gets its wish in spades.<br /><br />The new superheroes---referred to as \\"Metahumans\\", shades of X-Men--- kill without conviction, without code; kill with glee. They battle each other for style, for props, for kudos, for chatter on talk shows and the evening news.<br /><br />When \\"Kingdom Come\\" opens, Pastor Norman McKay consoles his long-time friend Wesley Dodds (and, unbeknownst to McKay, the erstwhile Sandman), now raving about the Apocalypse on his deathbead; we pan out the hospital window, to a cityscape---a ravaged cityscape, the tops of the skyscrapers gutted, torn asunder, oddly truncated, girded with scaffolding. The world of tomorrow belongs to the new Metahumans, and is no longer so much their protectorate as their playground.<br /><br />While the world languishes under titans less interested in fighting evil than in scoring airtime on \\"Springer\\", the original JLA languishes in retirement: Wonder Woman is stripped of her title and exiled from Paradise Island; Green Lantern broods above Earth in his gleaming emerald space station, a sentinel against alien threats; Batman, body now feeble and hair gone white and thin, has Gotham in a grip of law, order, and terror, policing the city through computer wonks and manipulating his army of robotic drones below the decrepit ruins of Wayne Manor.<br /><br />Destruction and madness tends to the extremes: a little superpowered barfight between new-fangled hypgerpowered superhero Magog's vigilantes and a supervillain (?) named Parasite gets out of hand, obliterating Kansas in a nuclear apocalypse and irradiating the American heartland.<br /><br />Now, in any world where Superman and Wonder Woman have anything to say, NOBODY is gonna irradiate the heartland without payback. So Supes comes back, augured as \\"The Second Coming of Superman\\", makes a speech before the UN (backed up by the classic DC heroes: Green Lantern, Hawkman, Wonder Woman, Red Robin) to set things right---and heads off to Kansas to throw the worst super-offenders in a specially constructed gulag.<br /><br />For the uninitiated: Alex Ross, who scored his sergeant's stripes with \\"Mythology\\", tears out jaw-dropping panel after jaw-dropping panel here, capturing the iconic glory of the DC pantheon of superheroes---Superman, Green Lantern, WonderWoman, Hawkman, Red Robin, Aquaman, Batman---at the very Twilight of the Gods. Of course, the Gulag doesn't hold.<br /><br />Of course, Lex Luthor is crawling around the halls of the United Nations, introducing Billy Batson (aka \\"Captain Marvel\\") to the literati and jet set, and brewing up plans---and perhaps even cementing an alliance with Batman?<br /><br />The story aside, you're in for a lavish feast in terms of Ross's artwork: outside of \\"Mythology\\", DC's pantheon has never looked this good, been captured in such lavish high style. The word \\"photorealistic\\" has been bandied around in reviews.<br /><br />But `photorealism' captures the world in, at best, two dimensions: \\"Kingdom Come\\"'s magic lies in the way it stakes out the superhero on canvas, and then plumbs down into that 2D illustration for the core truth, the ambition, the drive, the motivation, behind such a God among mortals.

Their men simper and pout, their women are hairy and have moustaches. The French smell; it is difficult to see the streets of Paris for the garbage, to say nothing of the particularly charming custom the French have for urinating in their own streets.<br /><br />And why wouldn't they? The only place in France where you can take a sh*t in a clean restroom that doesn't resemble an open sewer---mind you, without being charged---is in a French McDonald's---at high noon packed to the gills, it should be noted, with hungry French, who while packing greasy fries into their Froggy gills simultaneously decry the \\"McDomination\\" of their Gallic state.<br /><br />The French happily harbor, court, and countenance terrorists, bankrolled Saddam Hussein, maneuvered craftily to check America's move to topple him, and even played gracious host to the late and unlamented tyrant the Ayatollah Khomeini.<br /><br />The French screech insanely around their reeking cities in ridiculous, tiny, smoke-belching little cars, and work 30 hours a week in cramped, hideously ugly little office blocks made of ticky-tacky; the 'modern' Parisian business district of La Defense makes Detroit look like---well, Paris.<br /><br />The greatest general in French history wasn't even French---he was Corsican; the last great French military victory is nearly 200 years past. The French simper, whine, smell funny, and get in the way.<br /><br />Only France would name its nuclear arsenal 'Le Force de Frappe', something that sounds more like a breakfast pastry than a technological terror of awesome destruction. And the French---never forget---think Jerry Lewis is hysterical.<br /><br />As Homer Simpson said, it *is* good to hate the French.<br /><br />Which is why the gimlet-eyed \\"Our Oldest Enemy\\", the exegesis of French perfidy and a rattlingly good romp by John J. Miller and Mark Molesky, is such a tasty read.<br /><br />Franco-American relations have entered dark days. And yet, when pressed to the wall and cornered for the diplomatic machinations against the hated 'hyperpower' of the United States, the French bare their ratty, yellowed teeth and scream: we are your friends!<br /><br />Are the French truly our 'bon amis'? Au contraire, according to Mssrs. Miller & Molesky. Their rakish thesis: that far from being our most enduring friends, the French have been our oldest enemies.<br /><br />You'll choke on your brie and spit up your Merlot when you discover that at every turn in American affairs, a Frenchman was scowling beneath his beret (or tri-corner), ready and able to give our young Republic the bitter gallic finger.<br /><br />*The French & Indian Wars: Rage as the French and their Indian allies massacre colonists on the frontiers, allowing their war-painted comrades to drench themselves in the blood of prisoners of war, take their scalps, bash the skulls of infants before their terrified mothers---even while their French paymasters smeared the name of George Washington as a war criminal---all in the name of colonizing a New France!<br /><br />*The American Revolution: Yeah, Lafayette was a noble, stand-up guy---but the much-touted 'French aid' during the Revolution was coldly calculated, part of a global strategy France plotted against the British. It was shrewdly granted, administered with incompetence and inconsistency (the French are great eaters, but indifferent warriors), and featured a French warship firing on naval hero John Paul Jones, who nonetheless---despite the sinking of his Bonhomme Richard---managed to take the British destroyer Serapis *and* escape French duplicity.<br /><br />*La Belle Epoch: Was the 19th century truly an 'era of good feelings' with our buddies in Paris?

Ann Coulter is a national treasure: intelligent, aggressive, fiery, assertive, unapologetic, patriotic, unequivocally politically incorrect, and not afraid to say precisely what is on her mind, no matter the situation.<br /><br />Combine equal parts Ambrose Bierce and H.L. Mencken, add a spoonful of Camille Paglia, and spice with a dollop of George Sands, and you have Coulter, the political analyst, Cornell grad and high-powered attorney who fires her third broadside at American liberals, \\"Treason\\".<br /><br />With this third volley, the Right's Queen of the Night asks three intriguing questions:<br /><br />1) What is patriotism, exactly?<br /><br />2) Why is it that questioning the patriotism of the American Left has always been off the table, and why have those raising questions about Liberal patriotism been reviled as \\"McCarthyites\\"?<br /><br />3) And finally, speaking of McCarthy, was he really an enemy of American civil liberties, or was he a vindicated crusader against subversion and communism at a time of great peril?<br /><br />With an eclectic central thesis like that, and particularly considering the vitriol, confidence, and scholarship with which Coulter delivers it, is it any wonder this pungent, refreshing, and hysterically funny little tome and its brave author have drawn so much fire?<br /><br />In this methodically researched (the book is bristling with more than 45 pages of footnotes, most of which are taken from liberal columnists, writers and scholars)and bracing assault on liberal sensibilities, Coulter analyzes the behavior of self-professed American liberals from the beginning of the Cold War to the Second Gulf War, and comes up with a number of troubling points:<br /><br />1) Why did liberal Americans throughout the Cold War routinely understate the bruality of Soviet regimes, downplay the USSR's hostile intentions, work with 'peace' protestors to unilaterally disarm the United States in the face of an aggressive Soviet build-up?<br /><br />Why did American liberals preach 'moral equivalency' between the United States, which can't keep immigrants out, and the USSR, which built walls to keep citizens in?<br /><br />2) Why have the American Left constantly and lavishly praised ruthless dictator Fidel Castro, lauding Cuba's health care and education even as millions there are tortured and imprisoned by the vicious Caribbean tyrant for \\"political sedition\\"?<br /><br />3) Why have liberal Americans and their interest groups (including the ACLU and People for the American Way) been in the vanguard of those attacking symbols and traditions associated with American patriotism and love of country, including the Pledge of Allegiance, the Ten Commandments, and the Flag?<br /><br />4) Why has the American Left and the Democrat party allied themselves with America's enemies (the UN, France, Russia, Palestine and other Middle East terror states) and worked to undermine our friends (notably Israel)?<br /><br />5)Why, after 9/11, has the American Left and the Democrat party been eager to a) attack President Bush for taking unilateral action to protect Americans against terrorism?; b) been quick to accept uncritically the most unflattering and demagogic attacks on the White House, but reserve judgment on the terrorists who have sworn to destroy America? c) why, in the wake of the arrest of 'dirty bomber' Jose Padilla, did the New York Times rush to brand \\"a rising McCarthysm\\" as a threat far greater than that posed by Islamic fanatics who aimed to render Manhattan uninhabitable?<br /><br />6) Finally, why is it that the Chief Boogeyman of the American Left is former Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, who dedicated his political life (and ultimately sacrificed his political career) to ferreting out Soviet agents and fellow travelers in the U.S. State Department and military?<br /><br />More to the point---why McCarthy, but not true monsters like Lenin, Stalin, Ho Chi Minh, Mao Tse-Tung, and Fidel Castro, among many otherswho are generally revered in the university departments dominated by American liberals, and exonerated or apologized for by liberal leading lights like Noam Chomsky?<br /><br />The conclusion that has rattled teeth: American liberals hate their country.<br /><br />Coulter contends Liberals hate America with a black passion (for a variety of political, social, and psychological reasons) and are, effectively, traitors who wish to see America humiliated and submerged beneath a largely socialist global order---if they even have a goal that coherent.<br /><br />Regardless of what you think of Coulter's conclusion, it is hard to come away from a reading of \\"Treason\\" with any doubt about the Left's passionate hatred and contempt for traditional America. Another mark of American liberalism has been a movement to redefine patriotism to 'support the liberal agenda', writes Coulter: a true patriot, according to a Liberal, doesn't wave the flag or support the Pledge or go to church, but supports gay rights, multicultural studies, affirmative action, and mulilateral institutions like the UN.<br /><br />But that doesn't jibe with the true definition of patriotism: a love of country, of patria, of the Homeland, and a desire to further its interests over those of other lands and foreign institutions. Treason, by contrast, is disloyalty to country and fealty or providing aid and comfort to its enemies. If the current campaign by America's left-Liberal dominated press and its Democrat candidates to belittle the War on Terror and discredit the administration is not comfort provided the enemy, then what is?<br /><br />More to the point, Coulter addresses what many call the 'death of treason', meaning that in the new Liberal lexicon even the high crime of treason itself is rendered meaningless and extinct. In that perverse mind-set, John Walker Lindh (the 'American Taliban') was guilty merely of misplaced idealism, not treason; to the American liberal, Lindh was just a young man discovering himself, much like Bill Clinton marching against the Vietnam War in the streets of Moscow in 1968.<br /><br />Coulter's language is strident, passionate, angry, and vitriolic, to be sure; but it is a manifesto and a screed against a rot that endangers a country she loves. In that sense, \\"Treason\\" is both an engaging and often blackly funny read, but it is also a revolutionary document.<br /><br />\\"Treason\\" is an engaging read, a meticulously well-researched book on the American Left, and a rousing fusillade in the American Culture Wars.

If you haven't had the pleasure of encountering H.P. Lovecraft's \\"Call of Cthulhu\\" (Kuh-THOO-Loo, for those struggling with an idiom not meant for the human tongue and larynx) before, then I envy you---particularly if you're hunkered beneath the sheets of an antique bed in the garret bedroom of an 18th century Yankee farmhouse where all you can hear---now and then, when you strain your ears and dare to listen---is the beating of your own heart, and the squeak of an errant floorboard.<br /><br />H.P. Lovecraft himself is something of an enigma in the world of 20th century American Letters. The scholarly, polite, bookish recluse of Providence corresponded with so many of the great fantasists of his day (including R.E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith), yet traveled rarely, sharing with fellow New Englander Emily Dickenson a reticence of the body offset by a wanderlust of the mind.<br /><br />It is a marvel, having shivered through the entire works of what I regard as a Grandmaster of American horror, that such an intensely, acutely private man could have conjured up such vistas of the Weird, the Bizarre, the Malignant, and Apocalyptic, and could have presented them in such an indelible, blackly intimate, leeringly diabolic fashion.<br /><br />Del Rey's \\"Best of H.P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre\\", while scant on extras and certainly not one to lavish the adoring treatment afforded Lovecraft's work by Arkham House, nonetheless gets the job done. This is a seminal collection of vintage, unalloyed Lovecraftian goodness, 16 classic tales that will slake the dark thirst of the jaded Cthulhu aficionado while simultaneously scaring the bewhooskers out of new readers.<br /><br />\\"Bloodcurdling Tales\\" gathers together all of Lovecraft's classic terror tales (with the exception of \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\", which can be found in Del Rey's equally tasty \\"The Road to Madness\\"). In \\"The Rats in the Walls\\", the scion of an ancient New England line comes cheek to ratty jowl with the implications of his inheritance; \\"The Picture in the House\\", one of my favorites, is a homely paean to recrudescent terror and the joys of home cooking. \\"The Colour out of Space\\" proves the American family farm really *is* in trouble, \\"Pickman's Model\\" is a devilish black joke on the old axiom \\"Art Imitates Life\\", and \\"The Thing on the Doorstep\\" serves as a cautionary tale on the perils of yet another form of Black Magic: Love & Marriage.<br /><br />Then there are the three jewels in this cancred Crown: \\"The Shadow over Innsmouth\\", one of Lovecraft's finest and most operatic works (and recently adapted into the rippingly good movie \\"Dagon\\" by Stuart Gordon) is a slithery, subversive riff on the infamous theme of the Very Unfriendly Town. \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" is a globe-trotting epic, the very lodestone of the Cthulhu Mythos, and features a special guest appearance by none other than Cthulhu Itself---the reason for the Season, if you will.<br /><br />\\"The Dunwich Horror\\" is an equally nasty and seminal piece of grue, and all of Lovecraft's favorite ingredients are in place: the warlock who went one step too far, forbidden knowledge as cancerous and transformative rot, invisible horrors that stalk through shady New England thickets, and the shocking decay of formerly noble Yankee bloodlines.<br /><br />In Lovecraft's malignant universe, there are timeless horrors older by millennia than man. There are shapeless, hungry things that call the derelict and forgotten subways and caverns beneath Boston and New York their bowers and lairs, and would blast the sanity of a modern man schooled in reason and the scientific method. There is a reason Man is afraid of the Dark.<br /><br />There are Nightmares here: monsters tampering with space-time itself and hungry to break through into what we call Reality, beasts that shamble in defiled churches and ravaged tombs, ghouls hungry for flesh, madmen hungry for power.<br /><br />Sorcery and necromancy really works in a fashion: Lovecraft himself is proof of it. Though the author lies interred in Swan Point Cemetery beneath a hulking goblin tree festered with white fungus, he yet lives through his diabolic and shivery words, and exerts a far greater influence in our 21st century---through film, through image, through art, through books---than he ever did in the whisper of time he walked the streets of Providence. Lovecraft's work is powerful proof that literature can serve as Incantation.<br /><br />JSGrcery and necromancy really works in a fashion: Lovecraft himself is proof of it.

Lovecraft, while proving handy at mastering all three of the aforementioned timeless old chestnuts, suggests there is a fourth category: Man versus Thing.<br /><br />Any connoiseur of the frenzied scribblings of old Adbul Al-Hazred in the Necronomicon will find this second Del Rey collection indispensable as 1) a grimoire chock-full of searingly useful material on the recondite pursuits of those lovable, tentacled beings we know and love as the Elder Gods---mind your manners, sonny boy, they were devouring souls and mastering the Time-Space Quanitplex back when your ancestors were hobnobbing with euglena and paramecium; and 2)Scaring yourself silly.<br /><br />Man versus Thing, indeed.<br /><br />Lovecraft was a God among insects, a true literary Giant in the Earth, and the potent, vicious, soul-unhinging madness flowing from his deliciously warped mind is astonishing. Lovecraft took the great disillusionment that stemmed from the Great War and ratcheted it up to the next step, pounding the final nail in the coffin of scientific positivism, and his horror is Cosmic; therein lies his peculiar brilliance. Lovecraft is more than purpled prose and tentacles, in that he has created a world peopled with bloodless, bookish men of science and set them up against uncaring stellar horrors, leaving them with no appeal to God or Goodness. The crucifix won't help you against the horror bubbling out of *that* particular crypt, my good man!<br /><br />In Lovecraftian fiction, Mankind thinks that by harnessing the marvels of science and high technology, He will improve himself and advance the cause and course of civilization.<br /><br />Lovecraft knew better. In the Lovecraftian universe , Man is still a primitive, shambling neanderthal in trousers who lives in a dark, slimy, relatively unexplored cave. Science is a guttering tallow candle he holds before him in his trembling hand, throwing light on bulbous, slithering neighbors we had previously only dimly imagined.<br /><br />And that's the *good* news. The bad news is that Man's newfound, eldritch buddies are now awfully interested in him. And hungry.<br /><br />The supreme horror discovered by Lovecraftian heroes throughout the stories here---from the refugee from a German U-Boat in \\"The Temple\\", to the curious scholar who fumbles with a singularly wrong Device (shades of the Lament Configuration, possibly?), to the hapless spaceman trapped \\"In the Walls of Eryx\\"---all of them learn that Science is no friend, and Good and Evil are remote and relative terms on this tepid, livid blue-green orb hurled through cold and unblinkingly alien galaxies.<br /><br />The stories collected in \\"The Road to Madness\\" offer a spyglass into Lovecraft's literary development, but that's less interesting than the gleefully ghoulish, elegant sliminess of some of the ghastly tales offered here like gemstones in the darkness: \\"Cool Air\\", \\"He\\" and \\"The Terrible Old Man\\" chronicle the dangers of befriending or robbing antique old gentlemen in Yankee alleys or Paris garrets; \\"The Unnameable\\" is a tasty little ghoul's kiss in a graveyard in which Lovecraft taunts the typical critical assessment of his prose style; \\"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\\" serves as a clever riff on the Strange Travelogue Tale, ghost-written for illusionist Harry Houdini.<br /><br />But these tales, tasty as they are, are but molehills to the mountains offered up by the three jewels in this Lovecraftian crown. \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" is surely Lovecraft's masterwork, chronicling forgotten horrors that threaten the sanity of an Arctic expedition---and possibly the world. \\"Herbert West: Re-animator\\" offers an epic account of what some good old-fashioned Yankee ingenuity and a syringe of corpse-reviving re-agent can accomplish. \\"The Horror at Red Hook\\", a jaunt into some of Brooklyn's seamier quarters, advances a sound argument for urban renewal if ever there was one.<br /><br />Road to madness?

In the still of a country night you can feel them, pressing close on the wind: the forlorn gods who whisper about the crumbling hillside shrines. The nautical, bloodthirsty gods of the tropic Deep, who rose out of sea-slug haunted temples in the Pacific to feast on the anguish of Captain Cook's sacrificed sailors. The lonely gods of the abandoned wastes, bereaved for worshippers and curses that once worked but now, like dying tapers, gutter and go out.<br /><br />Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany, had magic in his fingers and a suspiciously lucid familiarity with the Gate of Sleep and the Real of Dreams. Some of his most powerful and affecting gems are displayed in \\"The Hashish Man\\", an indifferently bound but decidedly choice collection of his short tales of fancy, wild whimsy, the fantastic, bizarre, and strange.<br /><br />In the 26 tales collected here, not one fails to astound, to awe, to move, to raise the hackles. Dunsany is a masterful author: what most writers would take thousand-page volumes to do, he can achieve in a few graceful sentences.<br /><br />And the tales themselves: for instance, what could make ancient, fearful Charon, the ferryman of the Styx, smile and weep? Or what of the young Lord in London, who orders a table set for two, spends the night in conversation with an invisible companion, and caps off his meal with an astounding dessert?<br /><br />You'll learn of the piratical Captain Shard and his freebooting crew of the Desperate Lark, who, pursued by the bristling galleons of the Danish, French, Spaniards and English, affix wheels and axles to their ship and steer her across the African sands to the Atlantic.<br /><br />Or you can shiver to the tale of the Doom that came to the shadow-haunted wizard's tower of Thlunrana, or to the account of the feral man roaming the English wilds with his Three Deadly Jokes; or the weird marble goddess to which ships pray---their figureheads muttering heathen verses---at the Temple of the Sea, whence they steer when all the sailors are drunk and slumbering; you'll hear of fabled, many-spired Bethmoora, abandoned in a day, and of imperial Perdondaris, which celebrated its Great Ivory Gate made of the vast tooth of a fearsome beast, until the beast came looking for its fang.<br /><br />These are not just tales you'll read and consign to memory: there is not a page here lacking a gnome's treasure of wonder, and glory, and deep, dreadful fear, tinged always with melancholy, and a surprising gentleness, and perhaps a whiff of regret.<br /><br />Dunsany is certainly a wizard. He wields, with dangerous precision, the totemic power of the printed word, ever a double-edged sword. There has never been a writer on Earth who conjured up the fantastic, the haunted, the doomed and the damned like Lord Dunsany.<br /><br />If his sorcery-infused writings, heavy with the aroma of deep sleep, were traded in the bazaars of his tales, a single page might bring a wagon-load of precious spice, or a vat of deadly nightshade or darksome myrrh, or a trunk of gold. If I had to, I would willingly trade half the libraries of Christendom and Araby for a single volume of Lord Dunsany.<br /><br />So read on, savor and relish these tales of madness, and doom, and desolation, and irrevocable curses, and wanton cruelty, and wildness: drink deep of the draught, but beware---there is potent magic here.<br /><br />There may indeed be gods, and if there are, Dunsany was their Prophet and Oracle: Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany and Votary of the Strange.

Ya know, sometimes---to paraphrase the Lucrezia Borgia of our time, Hilary Clinton---it takes a jailhouse to raise a writer.<br /><br />Just ask Eddie Bunker, who serves up a crackling, earthy, deadpan honest and infuriatingly good read in \\"Education of a Felon\\", which just goes to show that if our man Eddie had been born on a beach in Tunis about two thousand years ago, he would probably have been St. Augustine.<br /><br />No, seriously: stay with me for a second. I'm not just trying to get a rise outta ya.<br /><br />But first, let's get all the turkey and trimmings out of the way: \\"Education\\" is a rippingly good true-crime read about a kid born and raised in the seamier shadow of Hollywood, a few years after they sheared \\"Land\\" off the famous hillside sign.<br /><br />Bunker is a kid whose chorus girl mother left his alcoholic stagehand father, a kid who made the rounds of every boarding school, military school, and afternoon-orphange in town, a kid who wanted to get out there---you know, out there, Man, on the drive, around the town, in a loud, lavish 52 Chrysler, with a hot blonde bombshell on his arm, doing the town. A kid who made one stupid move after another, engaged in petty crime, and ultimately spent the bulk of his life in one p*ss-reeking cell after another in San Quentin.<br /><br />Eddie Bunker might not have been born to be bad, but he sure grew that way.<br /><br />Now: because American society languishes, for the most part, in the suburbs, and because most reasonably-heeled American men go from cradle to corpse without running afoul of the law, there is a mystifying tendency in America to glorify, to idealize, to ennoble the badman. The Noble Outlaw, the exciting Other, the bandito festooned with his bandoliers and blazing pistols, stalking into a bank, brandishing his hot irons, and looting the place.<br /><br />It's romantic, isn't it?<br /><br />No, actually, it isn't. You'll get a lot of gritty true-crime in \\"Education of a Felon\\", all told with honesty, verve, and a surprising glibness. Just get past the first 5 pages---with are lumpy, and heavy, and a little goofy, and might make you cringe---and you'll see that Bunker is a natural writer who has really taken pains to hone his style, to craft a story that tells, that rivets, that engages, that entertains. Like I said, it's a ripping read.<br /><br />But that's not really what makes \\"Education of a Felon\\" such a delicious experience: no, it's the fact that while Edward the Thief does one stupid thing after another to get himself locked up in the Bighouse, end the end it's the Bighouse that serves as his monastery, his respite from his own worst instincts, and the proving ground for his experiences and the solitude in which he can write them down, and make them talk.<br /><br />The true crime bit? C'mon. In his rounds at San Quentin and pretty much every other California penal institution, Bunker runs into the true criminal mad dogs and masterminds of his day: Caryl Chessman, death-row lawyer and small-time monster, for instance. But most of these guys---the author included---are in for small-fry stuff: robbery, theft, drugs, pimping, the usual. Next to Bugsy Siegel, Meyer Lansky, Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, or even the Popes of the Middle Ages, Bunker's crimes are strictly small-time.<br /><br />It's the writing that transcends the man, and the writing got done in the Bighouse.<br /><br />Now: the solitary writer, the caged mystic, is not a new phenomenon in the world of letters. Jesus Christ had his wilderness; St. Anthony had his cave full of demons. The suicidal Yukio Mushima penned his Samurai epics locked up in his tiny writer's study, where behind a solid, locked wooden door he gave vent to his hungry demons; Hemingway did it in tiny bungalows on Hawaii and Cuba.<br /><br />Bunker needed iron bars and the Hole to get the fire out of his system. And if you read \\"Education of a Felon\\", you'll see that: when he's in the Big House, he writes likea fool. He bleeds his life into the paper. When he gets out, even with all the tools supplied him by Hal Wallis's wife Louise (including a swank bachelor pad), he leaves off writing to go wrangle chicks and booze and drugs. And back to the BigHouse he goes, to think and write.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a gripping read you can finish in two hours. There are some beautiful sequences, all written in the same gritty, steady hand: a few stolen moments in the Neptune Pool at San Simeon, or spending a fleeting instant with the Old Miser himself, William Randolph Hearst, a man locked in a very different sort of cage.<br /><br />Check it out.

Somebody once said that given an infinite amount of time, a roomful of monkeys with typewriters could produce the entire works of William Shakespeare.<br /><br />Now that might be true, and it might not. But one thing's for damned sure: give two monkeys a year on Wall Street and a book royalty advance, and they'll produce the rank, reeking, greenish-brown turd that is \\"Monkey Business\\".<br /><br />What \\"Monkey Business\\" wants to be: an arch, caustic, crass little volume that channels up the spirit of Michael Lewis (author of the howlingly funny Wall Street tell-all \\"Liar's Poker\\") and just lays it all out, tells it like it is, conjures up a few nuggets of humor and a few gut-laughs about the modern Roman Galley slaveship that is Wall Street.<br /><br />What \\"Monkey Business\\" actually is: a dull, unedited, whiney diatribe by two junior i-bankers who managed to last ONE SINGLE PALTRY YEAR at the elite investment bank Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, and were consigned to the copy-room, making oodles of copies of pretty promotional material used to market their Masters' services to Fortune 100 clients.<br /><br />But let's back up a moment: co-authors Peter Troob and John Rolfe went straight from B-school (Harvard and Wharton, respectively) to Wall Street. That alone was a miracle, as their writing, and general grasp on how deal-making on the Street works, will quickly attest. They got coveted Associate positions with a powerful and savvy Wall Street firm, and quickly discovered they didn't like being at the low end of the totem pole. And from this bitter pill, they concluded that the way to get ahead on Wall Street is just to pay your dues, bide your time, and cross the 3 to 5 year desert that leads from corporate serfdom to a plummy VP role in, say, syndications, or M&A, or structured finance, where you get 500 grand base and a multiple of that in yummy bonuses, all the while throwing a telephone at Carstairs's head or chomping that stogey while screaming at T. Boone Pickens.<br /><br />Wrong. The biggest problem with \\"Monkey Business\\"---other than the writing itself, written in *two different fonts* so you can figure out who is doing the story-telling (though both voices are at the level of an obnoxious eight-year old with remedial writing skills), is that it demeans and cheapens the real madness, and mystery, and financial wizardry done by twenty-somethings on Wall Street every day of the week.<br /><br />Troob and Rolfe never made the effort to get beyond the copy-boy stage of investment banking: as a rookie i-banker, I put in the 100+ hour workweeks too. I signed the divorce papers and faxed them to my wife, too, because---as my Managing Director confided---I wouldn't have time later. I showed some grit, some ambition, a brutal attention to detail, and an utter disregard for ulcers---and was rewarded by heading up big M&A projects in the Netherlands and South America---and all in my first year. I didn't get handcuffed to the Xerox machine, like Troob and Rolfe.<br /><br />The point here is this: the working world is what you make of it. \\"Monkey Business\\" is a caricature of the business, not a first-hand account, and worse still: a caricature 'written' by two guys whose Maximum Pain Index went no further than one year.<br /><br />What's next? A tell-all account of consumer-giant Wal-Mart, penned by two disgrunted one-year veteran clerks? A scathing, brutal account of wheeling and deeling at Exxon, written up by a fuming gas station attendant or pump jockey?<br /><br />Trying to get a handle on Wall Street by reading this book is like trying to get a feel for what a circus a ringmaster does by reading the diary of a circus monkey---and about as rewarding.<br /><br />A better use of time and money?<br /><br />1) For a non-bitter account by a Street veteran, try the legendary \\"Liar's Poker\\", by Michael Lewis---which is actually scathing, scalding, and really funny.<br /><br />2) For a highly bitter account by a guy who also lastedjust one year---but has some killer points to make on Wall Street and New York City in general---try \\"Riding the Bull\\", by Paul Stiles.<br /><br />3) For a riveting account, bitter and not, of Wall Street shenanigans and hedge-fund double dealing from a guy who has way too much fun in the world of high finance, check out Jim Cramer's \\"Confessions of a Street Addict\\", which is pure high-octane hilarity.<br /><br />Monkeys belong in cages with bananas: leave these guys to it.

You *are* the car you drive. You *are* your house, the imprint on your credit card plastic, the wallet they're encased in, the fit and make and texture and fabric of your suit jacket.<br /><br />This is your Life, and it's ending one day at a time: every single thing you do and say and buy, what brand is embossed on your plastic you wave at the culmination of the tasty dinner---and whether said dinner is done at Spago or the Olive Garden---marks you with the cauterized brand of Class.<br /><br />Paul Fussell's deliciously wicked little study \\"Class: A Guide through the American Status System\\" still remains the darkly funniest, if not the most authoritative, primer on class relations in the officially 'classless' American society. It is required reading: not so much if you believe it, or take the little class quiz at the back---for in the grand scheme of things, on this dying little planet heated by a flickering gas giant in our universe's back-of-beyond---let us agree none of it really matters.<br /><br />Let's back up a second: America, we are told, is a 'classless society'. True to our Pilgrim and Virginia tobacco farmer antecedents, true to the articles of faith of a nation built by scrapers and confidence men and the hopeless poor and deranged and criminal and visionary, we are a society where class---your origins, your breeding, your ancestry---doesn't matter. It's what you achieve in America that counts, right, and class be damned. Right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />For Fussell, the cultural bestiary of American society is rich, brutal, and distinctly defined, and he creates his own taxonomy of class relations and rule in this acid, wicked, acerbic, and nastily funny little tome. Like Caesar's Gaul, the American Caste System is divided into three ports: Upper, Middle, Lower. And each of these classes are further bifurcated: Upper into Top Out-of-Sight, Upper, and Upper Middle; the Middle into Middle, High Prole, Middle Prole, and Low Prole; and the abased Lower into Destitute and Bottom Out-of-Sight.<br /><br />And for all of this, then, the bulk of this slight tome is a treatise as to what Class looks like. It is certainly where you're from, to start with: geography is a determinant of destiny. You're from Newport, Rhode Island? Right this way, young man. You're from Truth & Consequences, New Mexico? A polite cough, a roll of the eyes.<br /><br />It's how fat you are. As late as the 19th century, corpulence was a mark of high class, as those with no money starved. Nowadays, things have been ratcheted upside down and inside out: Kate Moss is the gossamer Marquise, thin folks traipse across the 18 holes of exclusive country clubs, and the fatties herd along the commercial lanes of Wal-Mart and Ross Dress for Less.<br /><br />It's what you drive, but not necessarily so: to Fussell, the truly wealthy don't want you to see their estate---parked behind gates and trees and, preferably, crenellations and moats---and could not care less how beat up or dented or falling apart their 1975 Volvo is. The vast American middle class cares about looks, appearance, class climbing. If you care, if you worry, if you fret about appearance, about mowing the lawn and trimming the hedges on Saturday: well then, Gentle Knight, you're a hopeless Middle.<br /><br />Fussell devotes some time to one of the more hellish features of American class life: University inflation. Because having an education---however useless---has always been esteemed as a mark of the Uppers, not only have grades inflated, but community colleges have swelled beyond their modest, mediocre credentials: every city college a university! Every mail-order diploma a Mark of Recommendation to the Local Duke, Marquis, or Count!<br /><br />For all the taxonomy, *why* Class is remains more elusive than *what* it is: Class in America remains a moving target. JFK famously quipped of his sweating, blinkered opponent Nixon \\"that guy has no class\\"---but what is it, exactly? You can't buy it: Donald Trump has (at this writing, anyway) plenty of one C-word (cash!) but not the other (Class!). Old Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt made himself a fortune and sailed on his yacht to England, entourage in tow, yet he was ridiculed as a classless nabob and shunned at Court: 150 years later his descendants rule the Class roost---or at least one rung of it, anyway.<br /><br />Fussell's little magnum opus is not, Praise God, a formal work of sociology. Far from it: this is a nasty, gimlet-eyed little treatise on the way people dress, shop, buy, drive, eat, fatten up or trim down, and do so in a way that brands them forever as creatures of Class. It is done so wittily, acerbically, and in an illustrated fashion: you can laugh nastily at the little pictures indicating the tiny brow and advanced hairline of the low Prole, or cough at the bedroom of a high prole teen, festooned with the signet of the age: unicorns (or nowadays, gargoyles).<br /><br />You'll find useful stuff here on basic fashion: my hat is doffed to Monsieur Fussell for pointing out the hideous Prole Gape, where a man's jacket collar doesn't fit neatly with his neck, and juts out and inch from the collar line. Read \\"Class\\" and see Prole Gape everywhere.<br /><br />Finally, as with any Philosopher King, Fussell creates an escape hatch: the mysterious X-Class, an atavistic forerunner to David Brooks's over-achieving and blase Bobos in Paradise.<br /><br />In the end, of course, \\"Class\\" is not a Bible---unless you're a hopeless, and harried middle classer---but instead a wicked, deliciously saucy little ride through our twisted, tormented world of Great Expectations and Few Answers. You'll get a devilish little laugh out of it.<br /><br />JSGut what is it, exactly?

It is done so wittily, acerbically, and in an illustrated fashion: you can laugh nastily at the little pictures indicating the tiny brow and advanced hairline of the low Prole, or cough at the bedroom of a high prole teen, festooned with the signet of the age: unicorns (or nowadays, gargoyles).     You'll find useful stuff here on basic fashion: my hat is doffed to Monsieur Fussell for pointing out the hideous Prole Gape, where a man's jacket collar doesn't fit neatly with his neck, and juts out and inch from the collar line. Read \\"Class\\" and see Prole Gape everywhere.     Finally, as with any Philosopher King, Fussell creates an escape hatch: the mysterious X-Class, an atavistic forerunner to David Brooks's over-achieving and blase Bobos in Paradise.     In the end, of course, \\"Class\\" is not a Bible---unless you're a hopeless, and harried middle classer---but instead a wicked, deliciously saucy little ride through our twisted, tormented world of Great Expectations and Few Answers. You'll get a devilish little laugh out of it.     JSG	2005-06-20
US	52840999	R2NGUA5QII731O	1401201105	112811195	Lovecraft	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Writer's Block	Let's talk for a while, while the oil-lamp gutters and the moon rises over the ridge, about the reclusive Hermit of Providence: Howard Phillips Lovecraft, better known to his readers as \\"H.P.\\", the crepuscular spinner of tales both terrifying and fantastic. Lovecraft served as midwife to \\"The Cthulhu Mythos\\", a name taken from Lovecraft's titular tentacled beastie, an Elder God of mind-bending evil and frightening power, mercifully bound in slumber in the antediluvian City of R'lyeh.<br /><br />Sleeping, but not dead---for with strange Aeons, the Necronomicon told us, even Death may die.<br /><br />That Lovecraft penned scores of these scarifying night-gaunt atrocities, conjuring up their teeming legions of cosmically indifferent interstellar monsters, their rural cannibals and warlocks practicing their antique and horrible appetites in dark thickets and remote outposts---that Lovecraft did all these things is a matter of historical fact.<br /><br />As is his contention, made until his dying breath, that he wasn't superstitious in the least; didn't have a credulous bone in his body.<br /><br />As a committed atheist fired in the feverish nihilism of a broken age, Lovecraft declared that, if anything, it was his own nihilism that he poured full-bore into his tales of the Bizarre: if the stars above us harbored interstellar Monsters, then no power of Heaven or Hell would protect us in a world bereft of either Good or Evil.<br /><br />At any rate, Lovecraft said, it was all fiction. There was no Necronomicon, no Mad Abdul Al-Hazred torn apart by invisible demons for transcribing forbidden invocations: Lovecraft invented it, made it up out of whole cloth. The same went for star-spawned Azazoth, the Witch House, Arkham Asylum, Cthulhu and his minions---none of them were real.<br /><br />All of it was fiction: the legendary book of evil, the star-spawned eldritch horrors, the works. They were Lovecraft's literary creations, after all, they didn't really exist.<br /><br />Lovecraft lied.<br /><br />In Hans Rodionoff's bracing, nasty, feverish graphic novel \\"Lovecraft\\", the Old Man of Providence has taken the Writer's Motto to heart: write what you know. Lovecraft knows that the lining between our world and Madness has grown thin and frayed. He also knows there are ways to tear the lining just enough to let the Things that gibber out in the Darkness into the Light, into our World, where they can giggle, and scamper, and Eat.<br /><br />Most of all, Eat.<br /><br />Rodionoff and artist Enrique Breccia have conjured up a pungent, potent, nasty, merciless little concoction of dread, horror, grue, and slaughter in \\"Lovecraft\\", a ghoulish tale the Master would have loved. Indeed, the Master is front and center here: rather than the atheistic tale-spinner he presented himself to be, \\"Lovecraft\\" assumes the scholarly recluse served as a kind of watchman at the gate between the worlds.<br /><br />An unwilling and reluctant gatekeeper, to be sure: damned by his father's insanity and cursed with the Lovecraft version of the Family Bible---a copy of the accursed Necronomicon---young Lovecraft is forced to write the tales of the Cthulhu Mythos in order to keep the star-spawned monsters from getting through into this world. Talk about a writer's block.<br /><br />Now: the things between the two hard covers of \\"Lovecraft\\" are the stuff of nightmares. Interspersed throughout Lovecraft's life---his discovery of Arkham, his complicated and ambivalent relationships with women, his collegial stint with Harry Houdini, his professional forays into pulp fiction---are intrusions by the denizens of that Other Realm.<br /><br />The Gang's all here: the leering, cosmically wizened \\"Wizard\\" Whateley; the ravenous Brown Jenkin; beasts glimpsed in city streets, gone suddenly, subtly 'wrong', their faces masses of writhing, angry raw red flesh beneath top hats; Pickman's model makes an appearance, and even Yog-Sothoth itself shambles forth. It is true that for thedevoted Lovecraft reader, much of the shock of reading the stories has worn off, and so many editors and imitators have settled in to stories that comfort rather than threaten.<br /><br />It is a credit to the sublime, supreme artistry of Rodionoff and Breccia (along with adapter Keith Giffen) that they manage to make Lovecraft sick, warped, and disturbing all over again.<br /><br />\\"Lovecraft\\" is no less than a revolutionary act: Rodionoff and Breccia have effectively bearded the Master in his den, by literally envisioning and rendering in illustrated form and shape what Lovecraft himself had declared unthinkable, nameless, formless and shapeless. They have caught the Night Gaunt leaping on its prey, tracked the ghoul to its gore-spattered feast, surprised the hunter of the shadows in the bowels of some forgotten Pacific island oubliette.<br /><br />They have painted a vision of horror, death, and interstellar madness that might have sent the jaded artist Pickman to an asylum. Is it scary? Exceptionally. Is it good? Rippingly so.<br /><br />I see, now that the oil-lamp light is dying, that you tremble---fear not, the lantern plays tricks with my shadow. Let me douse the light. That's better---now that it's Dark I have something to show you...<br /><br />JSGbles forth.

Up to that point, it would have merited five well-earned stars---and then King just seemed to drop everything, poured on the gothic theatrics, and managed to destroy a creepy, creaky, meticulously created atmosphere with a few destructive taps of a word processor.<br /><br />That's a pity, too, because \\"Bag of Bones\\" had so much wicked potential. The book gets down to business quickly, and had me by the throat by the time King's haunted author, Mike Noonan, hears what he thinks is a little boy crying somewhere in his Maine summer home.<br /><br />It *can* be a ghoulish and genuinely unsettling book, and if you do decide to read it, you'll want to make sure all the doors are locked and you're tucked in a warm bed---with a good view of the closets.<br /><br />Whatever the critics say, Stephen King can write with a muse of fire when he wants to, and he writes best when he keeps things simple.<br /><br />I have always said that Stevie King is the William Faulkner of Horror Country: the man knows the way the four seasons dance with each other, knows about the secrets of thickets in Maine, is well-versed in the petty, powerfully interesting gossip spread from the corner store to the locally owned gas station, senses how old folks talk about those 'summer city people', is familiar with a town's seamy secrets, long forgotten in smoke-houses and woodsheds. These are his strengths, and when Stephen King is at his best---and he's often there---he plays to these strengths.<br /><br />Established writers are always telling younger ones to 'write what you know', and King does this, to telling, haunting, and often horrific effect.<br /><br />And at first, that's exactly what King does. \\"Bag of Bones\\" is all first person, and the reader gains an immediate, friendly, and easy intimacy with its writer-protagonist, still grieving over the freakish death of his wife and suffering from what must be the world's worst case of writer's block.<br /><br />Writing---even sitting down before a blank sheet of paper---makes him literally physically ill, and with a publisher and editor breathing down his neck for the next breakthrough novel, Noonan decides to take a sabbatical up at Sarah Laughs, the Western Maine cabin on Dark Score Lake that he and his wife had loved and visited every summer---until last year.<br /><br />Noonan wants to be a recluse and deal with his demons privately, but he soon becomes drawn into a custody duel between young Mattie, her daughter Kyra, and the child's multi-millionaire computer tycoon Max Devore, who has returned to the land of his boyhood and vowed to take the child at all costs.<br /><br />There is some fine raw material here for a first-rate horror story: Noonan's growing suspicions of his dead wife's trips to Sarah Laughs the summer before, the increasingly violent conflicts with the malevolent and ruthless DeVore, Castle County's own dark and buried history, and a nastily haunted Sarah Laughs. And for a while, King serves up some of his best literary work in years, and manages to ratchet up the suspense and terror as Noonan is forced to confront both his demons and the increasingly restive computer magnate.<br /><br />There are a number of homages in \\"Bag of Bones\\", chiefly to the melancholy \\"Bartleby\\" of Dickens (only King could make that character horrific)and Daphne du Maurier's \\"Rebecca\\": the loyal and beloved wife with a dark secret, the recurring nightmares, the lake and its victims, even the villain's name.<br /><br />And there really are some first-class terrors here, particularly Noonan's hideous dreams of his wife and the lumbering, dark things that stalk him in his nocturnal walks to the cabin: until his confrontation with DeVore and a particularly wicked assistant, King had me, and I was riveted.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Bag of Bones\\" is vintage King: he opens up a creaky cellar door to his musty Subconscious and shoves us down the stairs, into the inky black of that basement---without a lantern. But the final fourth of the book is akin to King having switched on the cellar light, revealing an empty room with a bunch of faded horror movie posters.<br /><br />Without spoiling the plot, we're cheated of a classic villain, and the central motivation for Noonan's peculiar inward journey is removed and replaced with something far less plausible. It feels cheap, contrived, jerry-rigged, as if Noonan's merciless profit-minded publishers had come out of the book and forced King to get cracking and crank something out. It took me completely out of the story, and I read the final 150 pages just to see what happened. It wasn't enjoyable reading, and it wasn't scary; it was a complete letdown.<br /><br />That said, there are terrors here, and the first three-quarters of the book is so enjoyable, and so genuinely creepy and unnerving, and King had built up such a rich, mounting sense of unease and menace, that I was screaming at the book as I finished it.<br /><br />The book's title refers to the old aphorism that \\"compared to a living being, the most meticulously drawn fictional character is but a bag of bones\\"---but by the disappointing end to this promising story, King's characters aren't even *that* substantial.<br /><br />JSGty Subconscious and shoves us down the stairs, into the inky black of that basement---without a lantern.

The dark delights of the gifted Stephenson's ripping good yarn is not the trip from Point A to Point B---which happens, for all of the detours---but the getting there.<br /><br />The poor young Knight: Hiro Protagonist, Knight Errant and warrior Prince of our near future cybernetic Underworld, freelance hacker and information runner, stringer for the Central Intelligence Corporation (formerly Agency, but in this day and age, baby, you gotta incorporate).<br /><br />Oh yeah, and Pizza Delivery Boy.<br /><br />Or rather, Deliverator, as Hiro styles himself---for Cosa Nostra Pizza, which serves up---along with its piping hot, delicious pizza pies---an offer the customer can't refuse: pizza in 30 minutes or it's on us. And you get a free trip to Sicily, and Uncle Enzo landing on your front lawn in his JetRanger 300 series, paying homage to you for the inconvenience.<br /><br />See, Cosa Nostra Pizza turns the Offer You Can't Refuse around on the Deliverator: 30 minutes or less, or the Deliverator is out of a job. And out of a life.<br /><br />By Page 5, our boy Hiro finds himself in the former situation, if not the latter. Out of a career, and back into the guts of hacking. He wields twin katanas, which speak louder than the micro-gun issued by Cosa Nostra to back up pizza delivery fees. He shares a storage locker out by LAX he calls home with underground rocker sensation Vitaly Chernobyl.<br /><br />Oh, and being one of the founding programmer fathers of the Black Sun, along with buddy Da5id, Hiro is a mover and shaker when he patches into the Metaverse, Stephenson's stand-in and prophetic forerunner of the World Wide Web---which he conjured up when the WWW was a faint glimmer cresting the binary monochrome of the old Dos/UNIX command line.<br /><br />In Real Life, Hiro is a nobody. In the Techno underworld of the Metaverse, he's Nobility.And someone is trying to kill the Metaverse and its hacker and programmer princelings, spreading a designer software virus called Snow Crash that crashes your system and fries your brain, reducing you to gibbering, drooling insanity.<br /><br />Talk about a computer bug.<br /><br />Who---or what---is behind Snow Crash? What is the connection between it and telecommunications mogul L. Bob Rife, who bought up the USS Enterprise to use as his own personal yacht, and has since made a few---erm---modifications? Who is this bad dude Raven, him of the Aleut looks, razor sharp javelins, \\"Low Impulse Control\\" tattoo on the forehead, and a black hog with a thermonuclear warhead joyriding in the sidecar? Why is Uncle Enzo and the Mafia so interested in Snow Crash? Who is this Kourier chick Y.T., and why is Uncle Enzo so interested in her? And will Hiro ever get enough real world dough for a decent pad?<br /><br />\\"Snow Crash\\" is absorbing, hyper-kinetic, eminently readable, and constantly intriguing: I polished it off in about 3 years one rainy Sunday afternoon. It's like that. For all the Tower of Babel imagery and Sumerian mythology Stephenson weaves in, this is not a meticulous and measured work of literary craftsmanship like Dumas's \\"Count of Montecristo\\", in which, if you removed a single word or altered a phrase, the entire structure would tilt, topple, and crash.<br /><br />Indeed, Stephenson seems to almost unwittingly channel William S. Burroughs's \\"Cut-up\\" style: any passage, any chapter, could be cut and pasted before or after any other and it wouldn't make a great deal of difference to \\"Snow Crash\\".<br /><br />But this is a giddy good read, constantly engaging and neat to poke around with like a new techno toy.

With the Living Dead among us, ambling out from those innocent looking farmhouses, barns, county courthouses?<br /><br />Always having to live on the edge? Always in fear? What would that turn you into, assuming you could survive?<br /><br />\\"The Walking Dead Vol 2: Miles Behind Us\\" is the next collection of comics in Robert Kirkman's ambitious saga of a world gone mad, gone dead, gone insane---and struggling to come back to life.<br /><br />The story arc that ended in the final, wickedly nasty frame of Volume 1---Shane's lust, madness, betrayal and death---is capped off in the first few pages of Volume 2, with Lori Grimes paying respects---and hatred---to a man who got her out of Kentucky, got her and her son to the outskirts of undead Atlanta intact, and then---to her lights---betrayed her. And came close to killing her husband, trooper Rick Grimes.<br /><br />Monsters, indeed. And not all of them eat flesh.<br /><br />The old gang---the survivors anyway, including de facto leader Rick Grimes, his wife Lori, his son Carl, and the rest of the troop---have moved on, first to the Wiltshire Estates, 20 miles south of the dead Atlanta, a luxury subdivision buried by snow, haunted by a few zombies---but defensible.<br /><br />Or so they think.<br /><br />Kirkman's story, and his characters, are just as compelling: we add to the simmer and spice of the pot by throwing in former NFL quarterback Tyreese and his \\"family\\", and Kirkman lunges into Poe territory by introducing gentleman farmer Herschel and his clan. Farmer Herschel represents respite, sanctuary, nobility, and hope---for a time---but that story arc begs the question, \\"what's in the Barn\\". That question gets answered, far too soon.<br /><br />\\"Walking Dead Vol. 2: Miles Behind Us\\" is good---but it's not as tasty as its predecessor. You'll *see* that from the first page: Tony Moore's amazing artwork graces just the cover, with Charlie Adlard taking over the bulk of the artwork and Cliff Rathburn filling in the grey tones. The art, consequently, suffers: it is far less detailed, less suggestive, more amorphous, and far less ominous than the first volume, and that hurts the story as a whole. Please, Kirkman: bring Tony Moore back!<br /><br />In the end, though, if you want zombies and the Walking Dead who have to fight them and live on in a world where sanity has gone AWOL---then \\"Walking Dead\\" is still a satisfying little morsel of gruesome delight.<br /><br />Dig in.<br /><br />JSGAdlard taking over the bulk of the artwork and Cliff Rathburn filling in the grey tones.

Let's talk, for a second or two, about the coming Zombie Apocalypse, the subject of Robert Kirkman and Tony Moore's ambitious and brutally beautiful graphic novel series \\"The Walking Dead\\".<br /><br />Let me break the bad news to ya, big guy. You're not going to survive it.<br /><br />Everyone watches zombie flicks with the notion that they'll survive. They're going to be one of the shotgun-toting mall-rustling heroes when it dawns on everybody that the Army ain't showing up.<br /><br />Well let's put it to you this way: the Zombie Apocalypse is coming, and you're not going to make it. You're going to go get your mail, or be carrying your groceries out of the supermarket, and that's when you're going to meet your first Zombie. You've got a billion things flying through your noggin, Champ: pick up the kids, college tuition, your crazy stock portfolio, war and rumors of war, bio-terrorism, the big presentation at the Office tomorrow.<br /><br />The Zombie is very Zen. It clears its mind. It has one single, driving purpose: it wants to sink its yellow tusks into your flesh and sample a little human pad thai.<br /><br />Isn't that the way it always is---these things, like summer guests, always occur when you're just not prepared?<br /><br />That's the guts of \\"The Walking Dead\\". Writer Kirkman states out front that he's less interested in a straight-out horror story---zombies springing out of the darkened woods and chowing down on some filet-au-Bob---than he is in exploring the dark thickets of the human brain exposed to what Kirkman calls \\"Extreme Situations\\".<br /><br />Exactly.<br /><br />The story follows Kentucky police officer Rick Grimes, thrown into a coma after a routine traffic stop goes bad. Just like \\"28 Days Later\\" he wakes up in an empty hospital. He buzzes on the nurse call-button; nobody shows up to help him. Which is, as we will shortly find out, probably a good thing.<br /><br />Why? Because the hospital---most of it, anyway---is a tomb. Dead. Silent. There's a corpse, supine, fallen between elevator doors, his guts exposed, partially devoured. But for that single dead man, Grimes finds, to his horror, the hospital is deserted.<br /><br />Of course, there's the matter of the lunchroom, stuffed to the grills with the Living Dead.<br /><br />You could call it \\"While you were Sleeping\\", but it's not romantic, and it certainly isn't a comedy. While Grimes was out cold, the World Ended. The Dead Walked, and ate, and infected. Civilization ground to a halt. His town is dead; his house, run down; his wife and son, missing. The neighbor's house claimed by squatters. Word is everyone has gone to Atlanta, where the military has cordoned off the city and is protecting civilians. Grimes, in search of his family, in search of answers, takes a police cruiser and heads South.<br /><br />To be sure, in zombie flicks I always root for the flesh-eaters, and here, whatever Kirkman says, you're reading \\"The Walking Dead\\" to see zombies, not follow a soap opera. But happily, Rackerton invests enough details in these characters to make them compelling: each has an agenda, obsessions, private vices, prejudices.<br /><br />In other words, real people.<br /><br />It certainly doesn't hurt Kirkman's story to have an artist as fine as Tony Moore bringing his vision to life. The black & white panels, the shadings, the crispness of the art---all of it is gorgeous, helping to accentuate the horror, but also to highlight the brutal beauty of a world gone feral.<br /><br />Life, say the Buddhists and Christians, is Suffering. Suffering shapes us, molds us, ennobles us or breaks us apart. This is what is at work in \\"The Walking Dead: Days Gone Bye\\": you see the characters change, shift, mutate, evolve---into stronger creatures, true, and into weaker, viler, sneakier creatures as well.<br /><br />But if this is a hard world, Tony Moore's artwork makes it a bleakly gorgeous one. Take a hard look at the scene around a campfire in a wintery wood, seconds before horror intrudes: the downy snow, the shaded woods of the thicket, the faces sunk in shadow, backlit by the fire.<br /><br />Some scholar once said that the Living can never stand up to the Dead: they are too many, and their hungry, avid minds are not freighted with the conscience of the Living.<br /><br />Kirkman and Moore have put that contention into question in their first auspicious volume of the \\"Walking Dead\\". Doubtless the Dead will Walk, and the Walking will die---but who will survive, and what will become of them?<br /><br />I'm hungry for more.<br /><br />JSGene around a campfire in a wintery wood, seconds before horror intrudes: the downy snow, the shaded woods of the thicket, the faces sunk in shadow, backlit by the fire.  <br /> <br />Some scholar once said that the Living can never stand up to the Dead: they are too many, and their hungry, avid minds are not freighted with the conscience of the Living.  <br /> <br />Kirkman and Moore have put that contention into question in their first auspicious volume of the \\"Walking Dead\\".

And, oh, a firestarter named Liz Sherman.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't find the plot here all that interesting. It's very elementary, lots of nasty mutated frog-hemoths, Grigori Rasputin, opening up of Doors that were not meant to be opened, that sort of thing. Very basic.<br /><br />But here, basic is good. First off, Mignola's chiaroscuro artwork is amazingly engrossing. It's intense. It's brutal. For all its minimalism, and it *is* minimalist, it manages to express a maximum degree, and arc, of emotion.<br /><br />Now: it is also amazing beautiful, proving that the pulpiest of pulp fiction can be artistic. The art here, by Mignola, is gorgeous, making up for the starvation-diet writing, which is competent but scanty.<br /><br />Now: \\"Seed of Destruction\\" is an origin story.

Africa roils with carnage and catastrophe, her plains and rivers running red with the Butcher's bill of AIDs, mass genocide, tribal slaughter, and even slavery in the Sudan.<br /><br />But for Beverly Daniel Tatum, the world has stood still on its axis for decades. For Dr. Tatum, it has been, is, and always will be 1953---perhaps even 1859: before the sixties, and bussing, and Brown versus Board of Education, even before the Civil War and the emancipation of the slaves.<br /><br />This is the gist of \\"Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together In The Cafeteria?\\": that America will forever be culturally racist. Even the most well-meaning liberal whites are wired by tAmerican culture to view skin as social virtue.<br /><br />Dr. Tatum strategically redefines \\"racism\\" to suit her theory, winning her battle before the first shot is fired: Tatum says racism is no longer the active practice of ascribing superiority according to racial characteristics, and consequently judging a man by skin color.<br /><br />Racism is a \\"system of advantage\\": count up the US GDP, tabulate the value of all US assets, then break down the wealth according to race: white Americans hold all the cards, because they are economically advantaged. White society cannot help but oppress \\"people of color\\" through passive racism. And because racism---and social oppression---can only be practiced by those who hold societal power and privilege, only whites can be racist.<br /><br />Tatum's conclusion? Black children self-segregating is not necessarily a tragedy---quite the contrary. To effectively 'deprogram' young black children of a subliminal inferiority complex (Tatum calls this \\"internalized oppression\\") hard-wired into them by racist White American culture, they must band together, and affirm a positive racial identity not fraught with mixed (ie: white and wicked) messages about beauty, language, success, and politics.<br /><br />Before moving on to dissect what's wrong with Tatum's theory and 'analysis', a few questions:<br /><br />1)Why *are* all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria? And for that matter, why are all the punks sitting together? Or the Goths? Or the Stoners, Metalheads, and Jocks?<br /><br />2) Is race the most important---or even *an* important---measure of a man? And if so, is forming exclusive cliques based entirely on racial characteristics, with the express goal of \\"forging a positive racial identity\\", the best way of coping, and thriving, in a multiracial (or even racist) society?<br /><br />3)If White racism plays such a deadly role in the development of young blacks (and other racial \\"minorities\\"), then why are some of the most powerful, successful, and wealthiest Americans black men and women?: TV hosts like Oprah Winfrey, government officials like Colin Powell, Clarence Thomas, and Condoleeza Rice, actors like Danny Glover and Wesley Snipes, entertainers from Wynton Marsalis to Dr. Dre, basketball players like Karl Malone and Shaq, even academics like herself (Tatum is now President of prestigious---and all-black and female---Spelman college---no minor feat) and Harvard's Cornell West.<br /><br />4) Finally, if inveterately \\"racist\\" white American culture sends out subtle signals affirming \\"white\\" standards, then why has black culture so powerfully shaped and transformed American society? From the Declaration of Indepence to our modern State Department, from jazz to the Notorious B.I.G., black culture has become inextricably linked with American culture. Dr. Tatum should go figure out the racial breakdown of rapper 50 Cent's CD sales.<br /><br />The problem with Tatum's analysis is threefold: 1) Why do black kids sit together in the cafeteria? Because race---how another man looks---has always been the lowest common denonimator of social organization, the most primal organizing principle. Go to a prison, Dr. Tatum, and ruminate on why black prisoners congregate together---or, for that matter, Chicano prisoners, and Nazi White Pride skinheads. 2) Tatum's approach is as a psychologist, which means the book is entirely anecdotal. This is not a scholarly work (although it is force-fed on university students as such)---this is a highly personal, completely biased screed against an imagined Enemy.<br /><br />But frankly, 3) Tatum's prescription against racism---drawing together with \\"those of your kind\\"---is a bullet fired into the brain of the considerable progress we have made in this country in the last 40 turbulent years. The glory of America is that we can transcend the arbitrary limits and classifications of skin, size, and geographical birth. Demographics, at least in our nation, is not destiny.<br /><br />Dr. Tatum rightly condemns anti-intellectualism among black schoolkids as a means of \\"getting back\\" at White society. But her prescription would only aggravate that tendency. And that is where I begin to suspect Dr. Tatum, who has based an entire career on chronicling oppression and racism, has an ulterior agenda: it is in her interest to foment a divide based on the pure fiction of racial difference. It makes her money to do so.<br /><br />For Beverly Daniel Tatum, as with her fellow racialist profiteers Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, time will forever be stalled, progress completely becalmed, the clocks of the country stopped dead at 5 minutes to 12, December 31, 1953. It would impoverish them, decimate their race-shackled constituency, and deprive them of nationally televised, publicly funded bully pulpits to acknowledge anything else.<br /><br />For Beverly Daniel Tatum, it is always---and will always be---the day before a brave young Alabama woman named Rosa Parks made her stand by sitting in the *front* of a Montgomery public bus---with her fellow citizens, white or otherwise. Dr. Tatum's message in this book comes across loud and clear: Rosa Parks should have stayed at the back of the bus.denonimator of social organization, the most primal organizing principle.

Lovecraft\\" is far more than a tribute. It is an update, a confirmation of the First Article of Faith of the Esoteric Order of Dagon: that with strange aeons, even Death may Die.<br /><br />It is a collection of illustrations and poems and wickedly twisted tales that pay homage to the Grandmaster, the Old Man of Providence---and then venture further into the darkness, without an oil lamp. Here you will find stories of a world inverted, of reason cast into the mad grinning abyss of the Universal and Uncaring, of a universe itself unhinged and gone mad. The writing is mad; the illustrations themselves, with which this nasty little volume is peppered, scream their insanity. This is not a safe volume. Here you will find no reclusive bachelor scholars penning correspondence to other sequestered academics.<br /><br />This book will not comfort you. It will not give you a whiff of the familiar. It will not tuck you into bed at night. Quite possibly, it will pull itself across your floor with its toothy, fleshy suckers, crawl into bed with you, and introduce you to the glory of the polymorphous Azazoth. Here are 21 short tales (two of them pen-and-ink depictions), four \\"essays\\" on Lovecraft (penned, evidently, by deranged former academics in rubber rooms) and the collection's crowning glory, John Coulthart's masterful graphic adaptation of Lovecraft's seminal \\"Call of Cthulhu\\". This is a black tome of infestation, sexual evil, corruption.<br /><br />Think back to the first time you read H.P. Lovecraft; what disturbed you? What was it about \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\", or \\"The Colour out of Space\\", or \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", or perhaps \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" that pinioned you with its nasty pinkish-grey suction pads as you lay there reading---what peeled off your skin and got into your system, infected your blood?<br /><br />For me it boiled down to two things: the uncaring, merciless, godless void of the universe, in which good and evil were meaningless conceits batted aside by the gibbering monsters barely conscious of petty, pathetic man. The other was the strong undertone of perverse, perverted Sex: think of the miscegenation implicit in virtually all of Lovecraft's work, from \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" and \\"The Shadow over Innsmouth\\" to \\"The Horror at Red Hook\\" and \\"The Thing on the Doorstep\\". There are deep and dark vanities to be sated, perversions to be explored that would not have survived the light of the Puritan day, deals to be struck, bloodlines to be entwined, new works of the Flesh to be consummated.<br /><br />These Beings---these nihilistic Gods, these savage Beasts---don't just want to eat and rule. They want to breed. They want to corrupt. There lies the horror of Lovecraft: there lies the stink, the deadly pallor, the ripe rot, of this glorious collection.<br /><br />I hate Lovecraft pastiches; those hollow imitators, happy to rob the Master's tomb and string together words like \\"eldritch\\" and \\"antediluvian\\". Only Brian Lumley's \\"The Night the Sea-Maid went Down\\", \\"Ward 23\\", and---surprisingly---Alan Moore's overwrought \\"The Courtyard\\" get anywhere near to that territory, and even then skirt the worst excesses of the Lovecraftian pastiche.<br /><br />By far the best tale in the volume is David Conway's warped, wicked, revolutionary \\"Black Static\\", which throws SETI, bio-technology, and virtual reality into the cauldron, mixes thoroughly, sets to boil, and conjures up a black feast of horror that takes the Mythos to its logical conclusion.<br /><br />Ramsey Campbell's fine \\"Potential\\", Simon Whitechapel's \\"Walpurgisnachtmusik\\", and Robert Price's \\"A Thousand Young\\" are all juicy, gory, nasty little tales of amoral players who find themselves played. J.G. Ballard is at his least obtuse and most shivery in the lyrical \\"Prisoner of the Coral Deep\\", while William S. Burroughs conjures up the Interzone, espionage, and horrific corruption in \\"Wind Die You Die We Die\\".<br /><br />Grant Morrisonis both sick and clever with his \\"Lovecraft in Heaven\\" a delicious literary spurt of rotten, leathery decrepitude, a revelatory little tale of realization achieved on the Old Man of Providence's deathbed, when he realizes his nihilistic little horrorverse is all too real. \\"Pills for Miss Betsy\\" actually made me physically ill---not because it's gory, but because it's patently out of its mind.<br /><br />A few of the stories in \\"Starry Wisdom\\" are deranged trash---as you would expect of any Cthulhu cult, particularly at the extremes---upper and lower---of the intellectual bell curve. \\"Hypothetical Materfamilias\\", while ambitious, is one of them; \\"From the Mouth of the Consumer: Rotting Pig\\" is another. Ignore them. Or submerge yourself in them, if you're that far gone---shoggoths don't care about the sanity of their adherents.<br /><br />I adore \\"Starry Wisdom\\". I adore it because it is the very embodiment of anti-pastiche: it takes everything you know about the Lovecraft Mythos and turns it on his rubbery head. And frankly, Lovecraft himself was a man far ahead of his time---and even he hadn't lived through the horror of World War II, of the atomization of human cities, the development of brutal biological weapons, mass genocide in Africa and Southeast Asia, the insanity of 9/11 and suicide bombers. His lonely New England woods and tottering Yankee farmhouses are paved beneath strip malls and 6-lane superstreets and big box stores that only get bigger and more impersonal: would he write about reclusive scholars now?<br /><br />\\"Starry Wisdom\\" carries Lovecraft to the next level.

It's always interesting the way genius deals with its surroundings: most writers go to Gotham to stoke the fires of imagination, leash a muse, and gain enough inspiration to unleash their literary Djinn.<br /><br />America's Old Man of Providence and Grandmaster of Horror H.P. Lovecraft didn't: he despised New York.<br /><br />That is the central theme and unifying device of these five stories, written during H.P. Lovecraft's \\"New York period\\", and fleshed out by scholarly biographical notes and commentary by Lovecraft scholar S.T. Joshi.<br /><br />Even as he hated it, the great metropolis worked on Lovecraft's fevered imagination. His stories of star-spawned, ancient, slumbering Evil are choked with revulsion and loathing for the tired, huddled masses of teeming immigrants, and for the clanging of industry that accompanied them.  Lovecraft saw them as alien agents busy swarming over and erasing the old gambrel-roof settlements of Brooklyn that so reminded Lovecraft of his own Puritan haunts.<br /><br />With that in mind, this a tight little collection comprised of the five stories most directly influenced by Lovecraft's years in New York, which Lovecraft scholar S.T. Joshi brands \\"the most miserable of his life\\". It is a startling observation, but one that jibes well with the undertones flowing like a Stygian underground river through Lovecraft's tales of gelatinous horror and ancient evil.<br /><br />For one thing, Lovecraft was hardly a reclusive rustic: some of his most pungent tales---\\"The Dunwich Horror\\", \\"The Colour Out of Space\\", and \\"The Picture in the House\\" all come to mind---take place in isolated backwaters, shrouded by forests and strange high hills, their antique villages cloaked in ignorance, cut off from civilization and plunged in a fever swamp of fear and superstition---all the better for star-spawned seeds of evil to take root and grow in nasty, throbbing good health.<br /><br />Lovecraft adored Boston and Providence. So why did he hate New York?<br /><br />The answers can be found in these choice little tales. His aversion to the swarms of immigrants, \\"dark and swarthy\\", chattering in their Babel of tongues and overrunning the stately purity and clean antiquity of an older, nobler Yankee America is most notable in \\"The Horror at Red Hook\\", a delicious little screed that makes today's concerned debate over open immigration seem quaint by comparison.<br /><br />\\"Cool Air\\" has always been one of my favorites, having nothing to do with Lovecraft's star-spawned Cthulhu Mythos but everything to do with the New York---and it all takes place about a block from where I used to live. Here we have riotous, teeming, clanging, steam-belching and smoke-snorting mortal industry side by side with ripe, rotting, putrescent mortality---even, as it turns out, helping the Decay pose as a living man.<br /><br />\\"He\\" is even better, and also has little to do with the Mythos. The nameless narrator---clearly Lovecraft---loves midnight constitutionals in the older quarters of the City; he loves combing the alleyways and antique Yankee squares of the Village. He falls in with a fellow night-walker and lover of the weird and antiquarian; accompanies the old fellow (dressed in cloak and tri-corner, even sporting a pig-tail) home, and the fun begins. Turns out those Manhattan aborigines weren't very happy with the pittance our Yankee ancestors paid them for the Island, and they come calling for payment in full---with interest. Brrr.<br /><br />Less compelling---from the standpoint of the collection, and only because Lovecraft penned them as \\"escapes\\" from the City to his beloved demon-haunted New England---are \\"The Shunned House\\" and \\"In the Vault\\" (the latter a nasty little morsel of American Gothic black humor).<br /><br />If you're a Lovecraft enthusiast, you have not only read all five of these tales a million times, but you probably have them in countless collections. So why pick up \\"From the Pest Zone\\"? For one thing, while itis delicious to encounter the stories on their own terms---any graveyard meeting with the Master is a treat---it's interesting to see Lovecraft's New York works grouped together thematically.<br /><br />Another reason: you get ample scholarship and a tasty biographical introduction by the erudite Lovecraft scholar S.T. Joshi, supported by David Schultz. Read the stories themselves, then soak up all the ghoulish incunabula Joshi has provided on this strange and fertile, yet---according to the author---deeply despised period in Lovecraft's life. Oh, and points for the ghastly, luminously wicked cover: I have see few collection covers that so succinctly, so brilliantly, evoke the interstellar madness residing beneath the mundane that the Master conjured up in his prose.<br /><br />Yeah, it's still true: if you can make it *there*, you can make it anywhere.

Its literary scope and scale and historical sweep is nothing short of revolutionary, and for all of its grandeur and jaw-dropping perspective, it is unfailingly intimate, brutally so.<br /><br />\\"The Count of Montecristo\\" is the story of young Edmond Dantes, a French sailor aboard the merchant-vessel Pharaon in 1815, who returns to the port of Marseilles with the glorious Catalan girl Mercedes waiting to be his bride, and with a promising future as the captain of the merchantman ahead of him.<br /><br />Or so he thinks: for there is no poison so bitter, so brutal, or so deadly as envy. And as Old Scratch slithered forth as a serpent to poison even earthly paradise, so too Dantes is stalked by an envious trio of the sort that put Caesar in an early grave: the bitter and calculating Danglars, supercargo of the Pharaon; Danglars's drinking buddy Caderousse; and Mercedes's cousin Fernand, hopelessly in love with his cousin and aghast at her impending marriage to Dantes.<br /><br />It is 1815; a time of shaky stability for France and Europe. The Ogre of Corsica has just been put down, exiled to Elba---but Bonapartist clubs assassinate Royalist generals in the capital, and the alleys of Marseilles are rife with whispers of Napoleon's return.<br /><br />It is into this poisonous, heated, feverish atmosphere that this trio of serpents work their vindictive magic, and with the flick of a plume the happy Dantes, on the very day of his wedding and at his nuptial feast, finds himself surrounded by soldiers, held at bayonet point, and hauled before the implacable gaze of Justice. And fatality!---Justice consigns him to the wretched dungeons of the Chateau D'If, a heartless, impregnable rock off the coast of France---for the rest of his life.<br /><br />To say anything more would be to give far too much away, but know this: \\"The Count of Montecristo\\" is both black book of revenge and horror tale: a consumptively engaging story of double Betrayal, Death, and Despair: a Man consigned to death and rot by his supposed friends and colleagues, buried beneath the Earth in a great black tomb, forgotten by his best beloved, lost to everything, left for the teeth of rat and Time.<br /><br />And it is also a tale of Resurrection---and Revenge.<br /><br />You'll want to get a copy of the unabridged version; Random House's The Modern Library edition (published in 1996) is a fine choice, and just so you can check (be warned: the shelves are full of sliced and diced pretenders) the unexpurgated version clocks in at a hefty 1462 pages. That means once you're through with it, you can use it to forestall a burglary or brain an assassin.<br /><br />Never have 1500 pages moved so swiftly and deftly. A rumor, bandied around the streets of Paris in Dumas's day which resurfaced in Perez y Reverte's mesmerizing \\"Club Dumas\\", is that the jolly-faced Dumas signed a blood-contract with Satan, and in return for his soul he was given a diabolic gift to be prolific.<br /><br />Diabolic or Angelic, there is no doubt that Dumas is pure genius: you marvel at the simultaneous breadth and depth and intimacy of \\"Count of Montecristo\\". There is no padding here; not one sentence is superfluous and every word tells. A paragraph sliced away here, a sentence taken out there, and the perfect, brutal, logical, coldly calculating structure would fall apart.<br /><br />In the meantime, the reader is introduced to some of the most fascinating and memorable characters in history: the tragic, beautiful Mercedes; her dandyish son Albert; her husband, the stiff and martial Count Fernand de Mortcerf.  We see, in his middle age, the ever-calculating banker Danglars and his miserable family, including the boyish, driven, devious and ultimately foolish Eugenie; the Prosecutor of the King, Villefort, and his fascinating family: the hopelessly innocent Valentine, the paralyzed, rabid old Jacobin M. de Noirtier, and the Prosector's young---and tragically greedy---trophy wife.<br /><br />Beyond these characters, \\"Count of Montecristo\\" gives us even more, taking us deep into the lives of France's Rich & Famous---and villainous! We come face to face with the Old Ogre of Corsica himself, Napoleon Bonaparte. We pass the time in Latin and philosophy with the foppish, foolish, overly confident King Louis XVIII, who would rather count the angels on the head of a pin than martial his troops against the lively spectre of Bonapartism.<br /><br />And I have but scratched the surface: this story is the very essence, the pure, undiluted blood, of swashbuckling fantasy.

We have mad monks, and midnight assignations, and foundlings and changelings and villainous [...] sons appearing out of the blue. We have plots, and poisonings, and murder, and villainy, and great heroism; we have connections to the marvellous, tragic downfall of the great Abyssinian hero Ali Pasha.<br /><br />In short, we have a marvellous witch's brew of high treason and infamy, a Devil's Codex of revenge, retribution, and absolution.

Did China have a hand in 9/11?<br /><br />\\"Unrestricted Warfare\\" means exactly what it says: that modern-day Communist China is dedicated to any means available to destroy its rival for the status of global superpower, the United States---and excerpts suggesting asymmetrical warfare against high-profile, high-casualty civilian targets not only suggest our own conflict against international terrorism, but ups the ante---the book even mentions Osama Bin Laden by name, and notes the destructive effect of an \\"explosion in the World Trade Center\\".<br /><br />China: even its name, Zhongghua, means \\"Middle Kingdom\\", the point at which Heaven intersects with Earth. It is the birthplace of great warrior-poet-philosophers, the cradle of gunpowder and high mathematics, for thousands of years the very bastion of civilization against a tide of barbarians.<br /><br />At the end of the 19th century, in the wake of the brutal \\"Opium Wars\\", millions of its people languished in the addiction of opium brought by European traders, who staked out their markets by bringing in the gunboats of their home countries.<br /><br />China became a slave nation. But only 50 years later, Mao Tse-Tung---another warrior-poet in the tradition of Sun Tzu---had mobilized the people to rise up against Western control, against the Japanese military, and finally, against the pro-Western regime of Chiang Kai-Shek.<br /><br />Today, China may very well want to be a global hegemon again, and if \\"Unrestricted Warfare\\"---supposedly a copy of a super-secret Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) handbook---has any credibility, then China was the shadowy hand behind supposed Islamic radical and terrorist kingpin Osama bin Laden's devastating blow against the United States---China's only real rival---on 9/11.<br /><br />Ask yourself this question: who *really* benefitted from the suicide attacks against the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001?<br /><br />Did Yemeni-born rich-boy-gone-bad Osama bin Laden, and his brutal Islamist terrorist group Al Quaeda? Since 9/11, Osama and his iron lung have been confined to high Afghani mountain paths or the depths of caves, tracked by Delta Force and the blackest of U.S. Black Ops. It's true that President Bush has been criticized for not bringing us the head of OBL, but let's face facts: Osama is never going to enjoy a nice chardonnay at a plush restaurant on the Champs D'Elysees again.<br /><br />Was it good for the Islamist movement? With terrorist redout and Islamist paradise Afghanistan having now gone through its first elections---ever---and elected the pro-Western Hamid Karzai, with women striding the streets of Kabul without chadors or burkhas---and with Iraq's Saddam Hussein hauled up out of his spider hole and elections soon to follow---you tell me.<br /><br />Who gained? In the early days of the Bush presidency, a harsh spotlight had been fixed, by the White House, on the global spectre of rising Chinese adventurism. Warnings had been issued regarding Taiwan. Congress had convened to debate China's coveted Most Favored Nation status, an economic treat the Clinton White House had always proferred to Beijing. Then in April 2001 the silent war with China took a more heated turn, when an American EP-3 spy-plane was forced by a Chinese fighter jet (destroyed in the process) to crash-land on the Chinese-controlled island, with its crew held hostage by the Chinese government for 11 days, during which relations between the two countries were tense.<br /><br />The stand-off crystallized a view in the White House that China was the new global threat, and forces---and resources---were mobilized by the Bush strategy team to re-assess the U.S. strategy towards this potential global hegemon.<br /><br />And then the brutal attacks on 9/11 occurred, and our view shifted over to Islamic fundamentalism. Who gained?<br /><br />According to this military review meant for China's senior deicision makers, the United States may have the strongest military on Earth, but its citizenry---and its political chattering classes, best embodied by the mainstream media and the New York Times---have an aversion to body count. The writing is terse and dry---calling to mind Zen Koans or the astringent military tactics of Chairman Mao himself---but the overall meaning of \\"Unrestricted Warfare\\" is clear: hit the Enemy in his population centers, terrify his citizens, confuse and numb him, intimidate the citizenry with the prospect of thousands of flag-draped caskets riding home in military transports, and the battle for global supremacy can be won without facing a technologically superior foe on the battlefield.<br /><br />This is changeless Chinese military policy, lifted from 4th century BC Sun Tzu to modern day China: strike with surprise, and strike hard. Never let the Enemy know where you're coming from. Use spies, assassins, messengers of terror.<br /><br />The point here is not to disparage China: she has her own interests, as well she should, and pursues them as any great power ought to. I have great respect for China, have always been fascinated with that beguiling land, and am stunned by the rapidity with which Mao took a humiliated third-world nation and turned it into a military and economic giant. But if China has its future strategy with regard to the U.S., mapped out, we---if only to secure the blessings of liberty for our posterity---must be ready for her. \\"Unrestricted Warfare\\" is a first step in mapping out the uncertain road ahead.United States may have the strongest military on Earth, but its citizenry---and its political chattering classes, best embodied by the mainstream media and the New York Times---have an aversion to body count.

George W. to his friends and admirers, Shrub to his milder rivals, \\"=Hitler\\" and worse to the bitter, bile-spitting crazies.<br /><br />Whatever the moniker, he's American 43rd President George W. Bush, and if you're willing to give \\"Misunderestimated\\" author Bill Sammon the benefit of the doubt---well, misunderestimate the the guy at your peril.<br /><br />With a platoon of books hitting the beaches to delve into every aspect of 43rd American President George W. Bush---his beliefs, his political career, his family, the Bush dynasty, even the Bush twins---why spend some quality time with Bill Sammon's \\"Misunderestimated\\"?<br /><br />For one, it's a rattlingly good tale well told and moves like a Texas brushfire.<br /><br />Two, author Bill Sammon, senior White House correspondent for the Washington Times, had unlimited to the President and all the President's Men (and Women), and he made the most of it: Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, Andy Card, Karl Rove, Colin Powell---all are here, up close and personal, and about as candid as White House senior staff can be.<br /><br />But more to the point, Sammon paints in deft strokes a brilliant, stirring portrait of President Bush, moving past the sometimes jumbled syntax and dangling participles to give the reader a real insight into the man himself. The result is intimate, honest, and occasionally profound: a rich and honest assessment of the most powerful man in the world---and, inexplicably, the most vilified.<br /><br />Sammon hits the ground running and moves in on his subject at an angle so steep, and with enough G-force, as to make a Spectre-gunship pilot blush: we get dropped into the zone: \\"Little Beirut\\" itself, as the President's father dubbed Portland, Oregon. The opening chapter is the stuff of high drama, and it moves at a rapid clip even as it underscores the baffling, violent hatred directed towards this genteel, soft-spoken Texas politician.<br /><br />From the first paragraph we're immediately at the President's side: riding with him in his limousine heading for the Portland Hilton, as he wrestles with his own thoughts on Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, an invasion of Afghanistan, and the larger dangers of the war on terror. Outside the streets have gone mad, as protestors scream obscenities and scramble for the President's limo like zombies from \\"Dawn of the Dead\\".<br /><br />Why do they hate him? Who cares! The fun in Sammon's incisive little tome is the fatal tendency of Bush's opponents to take George W. Bush for a fool---including former Texas Governor Ann Richards (who jibed at Bush's father, and whose political career was subsequently steamrolled by the \\"misunderestimated\\" son); Al Gore; John Kerry; and even Saddam Hussein, all of whom get walk-on roles---and rue not taking W. seriously---in \\"Misunderestimated\\". The temptation is to conclude, because Bush fumbles his sentences, that the man is a moron, and to act accordingly.<br /><br />The result is politically fatal, as demonstrated by the ranks of those either tilted off their high horses---like Richards, Gore, and Kerry---or who have been forced to fall on their own swords, like the New York Times, the BBC, Dan Rather, and Tom Brokaw. I like Bush's word-invention \\"misunderestimate\\"---and I'll wager you this: in another 2 years, it will be adopted into Webster. Nothing succeeds like success.<br /><br />Sammon cuts right to the chase: the President's enemies, most often Ivy-League educated East Coast liberals, have long confused words---mere symbols of symbols---with power, with efficacy, with ability. Sammon talks to pundits and politicians on both sides of the aisle: from The New Republic's Jon Chait, to Canadas's modern day Mencken Mark Steyn; from Bush strategist Karl Rove to London mayor \\"Red Ken\\" Livingston, who declared Bush \\"the greatest threat to life on this planet\\".<br /><br />In the end---surprise!---Sammon concludes it's what he *says* that confounds and infuriates the haters, not just the way he says it. Bush is no roaring Demosthenes, to be sure.<br /><br />But what emerges from Sammon's portrait is a man of deeply considered principle and solidly moral instincts: Bush is a deeply flawed man---like all of us are---a deeply religious man, a man who doesn't have to keep his finger in the wind and consult his pollsters each day to know where he stands. Only George W. Bush could have declared Jesus Christ his favorite \\"political philosopher\\" in a national forum---and not just any forum, but one of the crucial first presidential debates. According to Sammon, Bush's opponents hate him for that---and his admirers love him for it.<br /><br />I'll end this with a little Full Disclosure: I'm not neutral on George W. Bush. As an American, I love the man: in a time of moral darkness and great peril, we should be hungry for a leader with the courage of his convictions. As a historian, I believe that in 50 years, when all the sound and fury has died to a whisper, Bush will be judged, impartially, as one of the five greatest presidents in American history: a man who took his own counsel, and acted according to his faith and belief. We have a nation no longer swooning to big government, but marching to a new ownership society; we have a foreign policy no longer willing to appease and drift, but a martial, vibrant, muscular new pre-emptive approach to Darkness and Danger.<br /><br />Yes, Bush mangles his syntax. And yes, the Republicans now control the White House, Congress, and a majority of the governorships. 61 million Americans stand tall behind the President.<br /><br />Misunderstimate that.ds and infuriates the haters, not just the way he says it.

Why is Zell Miller so angry?<br /><br />According to Miller, the Democrat party has fallen and it can't get up. And that doesn't suit the tough old Georgia Marine one little bit. \\"A National Party no More\\" is Miller's shot-across-the-bow to his political colleagues, a catharsis for his own revulsion with the party, and an angry, often strident, always passionate call for reform. More to the point, it is a gripping account of the fall and rise of a real Rebel Angel that parallels the national self-destruction of the Democrat party.<br /><br />It is a rippingly good read, not only for disaffected Democrats, but for Republicans as well: can our Republic survive without a serious, solid, patriotic loyal opposition party to keep the other side in check? Is it really a good thing for a major American political party, with a constituency of millions, to be in a permanent state of paranoid schizophrenia?<br /><br />For those who don't know, Zell is a lifelong Democrat, a gruff U.S. Marine, a wildly popular two-term Georgia governor, a guy who paid his dues serving as Lieutenant governor of the state for sixteen years, and one of the most successful, colorful, brazen statesmen of the American South.<br /><br />And just for the record, Miller---a true rags-to-riches American success story, propelling himself from humble beginnings in a backwoods stone cabin to the U.S. Congress---was invited by President Bill Clinton to give the keynote address at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. But Miller astounded his colleagues and infuriated Democratic pundits when in 2004 he appeared as the keynote speaker---and a flushed, red-face, visibily angry speaker at that, lambasting the decline of his Party---to quite a different convention: that of the Republican Party in Manhattan!<br /><br />Back in 1992, Zell Miller saw Clinton as the embodiment of everything that would assure a new national Democratic majority: sound economic policy, a dedication to pro-growth initiatives, a sensible shift away from divisive, anti-American rhetoric, an ambition to make the Democrats strong on national defense, and a strategy to return the South---each year, at the time, trending more strongly Republican---to the Democrat fold.<br /><br />Miller is disgusted because that dream became a nightmare.<br /><br />Miller contends the Democrat leadership of the last 12 years---including Clinton, DNC chieftain Terry McAuliffe, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and strategists lik James Carville and Paul Begala---have squandered the promise of a serious national Democrat party that would restore the leadership and strong defense policy of FDR, Truman, and JFK.<br /><br />The payoff for the Democrat's poverty of ideas, aversion to risk-taking, and bitter revulsion over American use of force abroad, has been brutal: when Clinton came into office, Democrats held both Houses of Congress, the Presidency, and a majority of the governorships. Today, Republicans control Congress, the White House, and a majority of the gubernatorial slots---and stand poised to reshape the direction and content of the Supreme Court.<br /><br />How did this happen? How did a once powerful, coherent, and aggressive national party like the Democrats, once thought to have even American demographics on its side, come to such a pass?<br /><br />Miller accuses the DNC leadership of poisoning its own ideological well and of frittering away long-term greatness for short-term gain. The Party, he says, has tacked left and pandered to thost divisive elements of their shock troop constituency---with disastrous results.<br /><br />Miller replays the Democrats' one-time Greatest Hits: Woodrow Wilson idealistically paving the way for international law and a Congress of Nations; FDR successfully re-building American military might and taking the fight to two global Evils; Harry S. Truman pledging the United States to a bold Cold War against Soviet aggression; JFK slashing taxes and staring down the USSR.<br /><br />But according to Miller, the Age of solid, serious, strong Democratic statesmen is over. Gone are party stalwarts like former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, John F. Kennedy, Henry \\"Scoop\\" Jackson, even Lyndon Johnson---all political pit fighters who who were happy to rip and tear for their constituents on Capitol Hill, but nonetheless stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their Republican rivals on a strong American national defense and a fight against our collective enemies, at home and abroad.<br /><br />Miller laments a new party leadership that seeks to divide and conquer, but only divides; political hollow-men like Al Gore and John Kerry, who mouth patriotic platitudes while undercutting America's deadly, desperate fight in the Middle East; and the Democratic death-clutch of modern party luminaries and culture-assassins like Al Franken and Michael Moore, who only push the Party further into the abyss of American-hating extremism, and alienate centrist voters.<br /><br />No empty jeremiad, Miller's book is nonetheless no dry, scholarly, hermetically sealed work of political science: it is an angry battle cry, and contemporary Democrats ignore it---or worse, ridicule Miller---at their peril. Miller's \\"A National Party no More\\" is required reading for all American patriots, pundits, politicians, political junkies, and maybe---just maybe---ambitious future Democratic strategists who might find this a valuable handbook to blaze a trail to recovery.ing down the USSR. <br /> <br />But according to Miller, the Age of solid, serious, strong Democratic statesmen is over.

The stories suggest a writer with tremendous promise and some magic in his keyboard.<br /><br />I first encountered the noxious \\"The Cage\\" in an obscure horror anthology.  It is a shivery little morsel of pure dread concerning the fate of a stout descendant of the auspicious Hoegbotton clan. But it's what the story doesn't say---the dark things it hints at---fungus! dwarves! Truffidian priests!---that intrigued me, and led me, at long last, to Ambergris.<br /><br />Try \\"The Cage\\": you'll like it.  Upon my first reading, I found wicked, brimming with subversive, infectious evil. I wanted more.<br /><br />Alas, Vandermeer never fashions a crown for his crown jewels.  Expect an Ambergris any fuller or richer than that glimpsed in the five main short tales? Expect to be disappointed.<br /><br />But those short gems do gleam in the darkness, and for them Vandermeer merits a chance.  I have written already of \\"The Cage\\". \\"The Transformation of Martin Lake\\", about the strange life and stranger death of the prolific and powerful Ambergrisian composer Voss Bender, reminded me quite a bit of Stanley Kubrick's \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\": it is all about secret assignations, and night-haunted fog-shrouded alleyways, and dead men telling no tales.<br /><br />Then there is there is the apocalyptic \\"Dradin in Love\\", which is all about madness and obsession and disease and death, and the short and deadly \\"Learning to Leave the Flesh\\".  The moral of both tales, if there is one, seems to be to avoid talking to strange dwarves with tattoos.  The nasty \\"In the Hours After Death\\" brings an entirely new meaning to the phrase \\"dead on his feet\\". All of them are masterpieces of excellent storytelling: all of them leave the reader begging for more. All reek of ancient horror, of all too finite and feeble human lives, and of melancholy and madness, in equal doses.<br /><br />Why couldn't Vandermeer have worked this kind of magic over the course of a book, in which these stories really do interweave and suggest something larger---rather than merely cleverly self-referencing?<br /><br />The book also suffers from preciousness in presentation: like most collages, the book uses physical gimmicks as an alternative to cohesive storytelling. Alexandre Dumas used the power of his words alone to tell the tale. J.R.R. Tolkien aided his story merely with a map.<br /><br />Vandermeer, by contrast, needs the aid, presumably, of a full-time graphics SWAT team: \\"City\\" uses dozens of fonts and typesets, encryption, baroque chapter heads, all manner of squidy illustrations.  This is not storytelling, it's graphic design.<br /><br />\\"The Early History of the City of Ambergris\\" is a prime example of padding which could have served its purpose of unifying the five tales---but instead makes a point of using a war-fleet of footnotes and teensy tinsey marginalia to assault the reader's eyeballs.  Ugh. And please, don't get me started on \\"The Strange Case of X\\", in which the author unforgivably inserts himself into his own creation like some sci-fi version of Woody Allen.<br /><br />Worse, Ambergris itself is largely a clone of Byzantium (modern day Istanbul): a chaotic pastiche transplanted out of space and time to the \\"River Moth\\", cobbled together of place-names and battle-sites and historical figures Vandermeer has intellectually grave-robbed from the tomb of Byzantine Imperial history.  When Conan creator Robert E. Howard was creating his absorbing, living, breathing *world* of Hyperborea and cobbled together or corrupted the names of actual kings and kingdoms of antiquity, he was called a hack.  In our less demanding age, Vandermeer does this and is called \\"brilliant\\".<br /><br />Recommended, though, if only for these wondrous little short nuggets of terror and melancholy nearly buried in the offal of the overall book.  The little glimpses we see of an Ambergris---the fungal growths, the constant patter of rain on Albumuth Boulevard, the grisly and carnal orgies that accompany the Greater Festival of the Freshwater Squid each year, the menacing Grey Caps---all of these things make me wish Vandermeer had been more ambitious, and truly wrestled with his creation to give us a living, breathing city.meer has intellectually grave-robbed from the tomb of Byzantine Imperial history.

In our less demanding age, Vandermeer does this and is called \\"brilliant\\". <br /> <br />Recommended, though, if only for these wondrous little short nuggets of terror and melancholy nearly buried in the offal of the overall book.  The little glimpses we see of an Ambergris---the fungal growths, the constant patter of rain on Albumuth Boulevard, the grisly and carnal orgies that accompany the Greater Festival of the Freshwater Squid each year, the menacing Grey Caps---all of these things make me wish Vandermeer had been more ambitious, and truly wrestled with his creation to give us a living, breathing city.   <br />	2004-12-02

Let's take a deep breath: whatever your political beliefs and whoever you voted for November 2nd, two points are clear:<br /><br />1) Democrat presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) made Vietnam not only an issue, but *the* issue in his campaign for the White House.<br /><br />Kerry contended his mysteriously abbreviated 4 month Tour of Duty (standard Tours were 1 year) made him an authentic American war hero. Accepting his party's nomination, he underscored this martial campaign touchstone with a flaccid salute: \\"Private John Kerry reporting for duty\\".<br /><br />2)But wait---Kerry campaigned to a battle-weary nation as a hawkish \\"war hero\\", who nonetheless had opposed USD 87 billion in funding to soldiers whose presence in Iraq he had voted for---but more than this, Kerry had appeared before Congress in 1971, in full military regalia, to brand his fellow soldiers \\"war criminals\\".<br /><br />John O'Neill, himself a decorated Vietnam veteran who served with John Kerry, had faced the man who met with the VietCong in Paris, agreed to all of their political demands, and denounced his fellow soldiers as war criminals even as thousands of them languished in Vietnamese prison camps. But he had not seen the man who now polished up his medals and dusted off his military uniform for political service---this new John Kerry, who now presented himself for the highest office in the land he had formerly reviled.<br /><br />As a result, we have \\"Unfit for Command\\", a brilliant, toxic, honestly angry little fusillade against hypocrisy, cant and treachery.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is O'Neill's compelling case:<br /><br />1) John Kerry describes himself as a 'war hero', but his own tour of duty was just 4 months---8 months short of the 1 year standard tour. Kerry merits the dubious distinction of being the only Swift boat sailor to leave Vietnam early, an indulgence he was able to obtain by citing his three purple hearts as a mitigating factor in getting outta Dodge.<br /><br />2) But O'Neill drills down into those three Purple Hearts that Kerry has made so much of politically. A Purple Heart is awarded to a soldier for sustaining an injury in combat. O'Neill, backed up by his 260-man band of brothers, contends Kerry inflicted at least one of these wounds, and as a result returned home while his brother servicemen fought, campaigned, were killed and even taken prisoner.<br /><br />3) O'Neill acknowledges that it's difficult to delve deep into the specifics of Kerry's war record, because Kerry himself refuses to sign a simple two-page release for (the Form 180) that would enable full access to his military record. Why not? For such a decorated American \\"war hero\\", who after all based his entire presidential campaign on his military heroism, it seems that would be the most natural thing in the world for John Kerry to do. So, O'Neill asks, why hasn't he?<br /><br />4) But let's stop for a second and consider: why such vitriol on the part of Mr. O'Neill? Why bring this up, so many years after Vietnam?<br /><br />I think that's an easy question to answer: because when someone like Kerry attacks you at your very core, calumnies you and your fellow soldiers as war criminals, and contends (as Kerry did before Congress in 1971) that \\"war crimes in Vietnam are the rule and not the exception\\", then it is too much to bear that this man would in turn use that very military service he so ridiculed to endorse his own run for the White House.<br /><br />Yes, O'Neill faced off against Kerry on a 1971 episode of the \\"Dick Cavett Show\\", and his own website touts the fact---and underscores the appearance was done at the behest of the Nixon White House. Kerry defenders say this appearance casts doubt on O'Neill's veracity.<br /><br />So? Should not truth and honor call out to truth and honor?<br /><br />Kerry branded his fellow soldiers with the charge of \\"war crimes\\"; tarnished them with the insult of atrocity. O'Neill and his fellow Swifties fought back, armed only with the truth. The document of their service is \\"Unfit for Command\\". Their statement of efficacy is the demise of the Kerry presidential campaign.<br /><br />That is the nature of colossal tragedy: that an impudent, politically ambitious cipher chose to clamber up society's pole using the corpses of his fellow soldiers as ballast---and in turn, they, armed with no more than the truth, sunk him.tion\\", then it is too much to bear that this man would in turn use that very military service he so ridiculed to endorse his own run for the White House.  <br /> <br />Yes, O'Neill faced off against Kerry on a 1971 episode of the \\"Dick Cavett Show\\", and his own website touts the fact---and underscores the appearance was done at the behest of the Nixon White House.

The Left despise him because they know he knows.<br /><br />David Horowitz realizes two critical truths that still escape many Americans and brandishes both like AK-47s in his brazen, brilliant and dead-on accurate \\"Unholy Alliance: Radical Islam and the American Left\\": 1) We're in a bloody, brutal war for our very lives; and 2) Our deadliest opponents aren't necessarily drawing up schematics for the next great atrocity in some Afghani cave-bunker, or squatting with RPGs and AK-47's in Fallujah---they're among us, holding high office in Congress, teaching our children, entrenched and deeply tenured in our highest institutions of learning.<br /><br />\\"Unholy Alliance\\" launches an intellectual bunker-buster against liberal hypocrisy. Since the atrocities of 9/11, Horowitze wonders:<br /><br />1) Why the Left responded within two weeks of 9/11 with protests decrying racism and oppression targeting Muslims, assuming Americans would react with bigotry and hatred---when in fact very few such acts actually occurred?<br /><br />2) Why the Left, historically a champion of Womens' Rights and Gender Equality in America, is uncharacteristically silent when it comes to acknowledging Bush's triumph in providing the women of Afghanistan with the first political and social freedom they've experienced in history? Where is the celebration among Leftist \\"sisters\\" for the emancipation of these Afghani women from their chadors and burkhas?<br /><br />3) Why have Leftists and their representatives in Congress tried at every turn to stymie, stall, ridicule and defeat President Bush and Republicans in their effort to democratize the Middle East, and spread freedom as an antidote to the 7th century Islamic depotisms now breeding hatred, violence, and terrorism in that region?<br /><br />4) Why have Democrats not rejoiced in the noble experiment of democracy conducted in the very heart of what was the old Abbasid Caliphate, in the very bowels of once tyrannical Babylon?<br /><br />In \\"Unholy Alliance\\", Horowitz points out that the typical American Leftist critique of the war for the liberation of Iraq is indistinguishable from the orthodox Islamist attack on it: that Bush is merely serving the demands of his rich oil company backers and an influential cabal of \\"neo-conservative\\" policy wonks who have stormed the commanding heights of the White House. Horowitz underscores his point by showing how this is identical to the party line coming of of Wahabi mosques from Mosul to Riyadh.<br /><br />But why? Why would a movement that has historically fought in the trenches against racism, discrimination, and sexual oppression join hands with radical Islamism, a deeply religious and fascistic political force advocating full-blown theocracy, gender apartheid, death for homosexuals, severe curtailing of free speech and human rights, slavery (in the Sudan, for instance), and terror and genocide directed against opponents of religiously received orthodoxy? Isn't the Islamist threat the very embodiment of the ugliness of human nature that modern day Liberalism supposedly sets itself against?<br /><br />Horowitz: Yes, and yes---but it doesn't matter.  The Alliance between the American Left and Islam is one of convenience: the one side believes it will discard the other when it ceases to be useful.  The other side believes it will either convert or kill its \\"Ally\\".<br /><br />Horowitz's point is that the American Left has always been willing to enter similar \\"Unholy Alliances\\" as a marriage of convenience designed to undermine the Right, and take power in American institutions: American leftists and their fellow travelers in major national newspapers, Congress, universities, and even big business have been willing tomake common cause with dictators and tyrants. Noam Chomksy scoffed at reports of Pol Pot's atrocities and proclivity for skull-stacking in Cambodia as \\"CIA lies\\", and his leftist useful idiots took him at his word. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter took tyrannical dictator Fidel Castro at his word while condeming George W. Bush as \\"pursuing an illegal war\\" against Saddam Hussein. Former U.S. presidential candidate Senator John Kerry met with the vicious, nihilistic child killers of the VietCong in Paris while simultaneously condemning his fellow GIs as \\"war criminals\\".<br /><br />\\"Unholy Alliance\\" contends that modern American liberalism, like Nazi Germany with its Soviet Non-Aggression pact of 1939, is willing to sign a peace treaty with the Devil if it can use it for ammunition to seize political power in the United States.

Bush, who he contends has seized the White House and Washington as a 'revolutionary power' with contempt for representative Democracy. He's angry at Al Gore's defeat, and presumably the loss of the prominent position he doubtless would have played on a Gore economic team. He's angry at the stock market crash, angry at the stock market boom, angry at failures in corporate governance, angry at the expanding federal deficit.<br /><br />Metallica has nothing on Paul Krugman when it comes to being angry.<br /><br />\\"The Great Unraveling\\" is both mind-rippingly frustrating and elegantly instructive. The book is frustrating in that it is evident that we have lost Professor Krugman, a scholar who loved his subject and made it accessible to the general public, and that what remains is a partisan and pundit, a man stripped of credibility, reduced to churning out this collection of more than 100 columns from the New York Times that comprise the book.<br /><br />These columns, taken together, boil down to the same four arguments: 1) Bush is evil; 2) the Republicans are evil; 3) Privatizing Social Security accounts is Evil; and 4) Tax cuts destroyed the 'Surplus', and thus are, well, Evil.<br /><br />Why is \\"The Great Unraveling\\" instructive? Because it serves as a real-time account of an unraveling, alright---the unraveling of the mind of a once skilled and savvy economist, forced from analyzing economic events to scribbling out political spin. The two stars I've generously provided this screed stem from its use as a voluntary psychological study of the increasing derangement of a great mind.<br /><br />Krugman is obviously a gifted writer and, once upon a time, a precociously talented economist with a knack for explaining complex ideas in cogent layman's language. And to Krugman's credit, the book is well written, and teems with charts and graphs and statistics, marshalled and quartered to support Krugman's central thesis: that the Bush administration is \\"bad economics wrapped in right-wing politics\\", and that the end result will be a country rife with growing inflation, a massive budget deficit, and declining growth rates.<br /><br />But isn't this all familiar? Doesn't this feel like deja vu?<br /><br />It should, because it's the same argument Krugman advanced in his 1991 book \\"The Age of Diminished Expectations\\", in which he contended that increasing budget deficits (all Reagan and Bush I's fault, naturally) would cause the American savings rate to fall, investment to plummet, and growth to fall and ultimatley stagnate. In that tome, Krugman argued that the good times were gone for good, but that Americans would condition themselves to accept diminishing expectations.<br /><br />None of that happened. In spite of Krugman's panicked fulminations, foreign investment, judiciously applied business tax credits, and a cut in the capital gains tax, coupled with American companies that emerged lean and mean from the merger-driven eighties, bolstered U.S. economic efficiency, boosted growth, and drove U.S. investment to the highest levels in history.<br /><br />But being an economist is lonely, thankless work, and the worst of it is that taking a stand and making a forecast means, inevitably, that you leave a paper trail behind when you're wrong. That said, Krugman hasn't learned his lesson, and his new arguments are oldies---but not goodies. And in the face of Krugman's dire warnings, current events have already proved him wrong. Consider:<br /><br />1) Krugman argues that the series of Bush tax cuts decimated the 'Clinton Surplus', and sparked the 2000-2003 recession. But the recession started in the last quarter of 2000, well before Bush was inaugurated. Similarly, the stock market began to plunge in March of 2000.<br /><br />2) Krugman is nominally a Keynesian, but only if a Democrat is in the White House. Keynesian theory argues that in a recession, loose monetary policy is called for---cut taxes and spend like crazy. Yet in the face of a recession made worse by the 9/11 attacks, Krugman would have the President's economic team *raise* taxes and *cut* spending, a recipe that would have curtailed investment and tightened the money supply. In other words, Krugman criticizes Bush for doing the very things that a good Keynsian (the Keynesian Krugman used to be) would do to stave off a recession.<br /><br />3) Krugman blasts the Bush Administration for currying favor with big business---like Enron---by pushing for business-friendly loopholes. He's right to call for corporate governance reform, but it's hard to take his tirade on Bush's Enron connection seriously, given that in 1998 he was a paid Enron consultant (taking in more than USD 50,000 per year from the firm) and a member of Enron's Outside Advisory Board of Directors. Moreover, contrary to Krugman's analysis, for all Enron's political donations, the Bush White House did nothing to save the firm.<br /><br />4) Finally, with year-to-year growth in 2003 projected at 5.7%, unemployment falling (at its worst we flirted with 6%, half that of most Western European countries), profit margins at their highest (13.7%) level since 1997, and stock markets roaring again (as of this writing, the NYSE is up 33% since April and the Nasdaq up 70% since October 2002), it's obvious that Krugman is just whistling in the wind.<br /><br />Krugman's book is that most dangerous of works, a disingenuous political broadside masquerading as economics. To those who want to read the book as an inside account of a once fine economist's fall from grace, fine; but to those who want to learn about how the country's economy works, and how government can be used to stave off both inflation and recession, \\"The Great Unraveling\\" is worse than useless.2) Krugman is nominally a Keynesian, but only if a Democrat is in the White House.

Chomsky's tired old flesh serves as a roadmap of where we've been and why we're here: a radicalizer. A revolutionary. A ghoul. A man whose tirades, screeds, and bromides against America are critical to understand in order to better grasp the vast divide that made our last two presidential elections such potboilers, have cast a once vital and moderate political opposition into something akin to a secular outer darkness, and today leads so many of our commentators to wring their hands at what they consider a divided nation.<br /><br />Read Noam Chomsky in the same way you might read \\"Mein Kampf\\" by Adolf Hitler. Read it to drink in the sickness of a diseased mind gone wild with the fever heat. Read it as a diary of madness. Try not to be infected. Read it as a literary warning beacon.  Read it to better sense the ravings of a gifted lunatic.  With that in mind, a little Chomsky is called for, not a lot.<br /><br />\\"9/11\\" fits the bill perfectly for the uninitiated: it is a pure distillation of the red rage and intellectual fossilization that has characterized Chomsky since the sixties, when he turned his passion for linguistics into a fixation on the injustice and evil of a nation, the United States of America, that had provided him with leisure and a sounding board. It is a sounding board for the modern Democrat party, for a party that stands days away from electing the frothing-mad Howard dean as its titular head, from anointing Michael Moore as its patron saint, heart, and soul.<br /><br />Chomsky's \\"theories\\" make up a fearsome if fossilized triumvirate of ideas:<br /><br />1) America's consumerist culture of death has resulted in a kind of uber-political \\"shop til you drop\\" institutional structure that hates starving children and seeks to export its greedy, amoral capitalism abroad.<br /><br />2)Israel is the primary beneficiary of this consumerist, Mickey Mouse \\"Culture of Death\\".<br /><br />3)9/11 occurred precisely because of our neo-imperialist retro-colonialist desire to export our consumerist Armaggedon through Israel into the Arab world.  In Chomsky's distorted, sick, twisted, paranoid world view, America is guilty because the indigenous cultures---The arabs, the pygmies, the Zoroastrians, the Hindus---want to buy what we're selling. Never mind their free will, we should have been advanced enough never to sell, let alone manufacture, the goods we offer up in the Arab soukh.<br /><br />4) As a result, according to Chomsky, we deserved 9/11.  Stop.  Breathe.  Focus.  Because of our policy---that is to say, our preference for democracy, property rights, privacy rights, freedom of speech---in a time of peace, 3000 plus people who did nothing more than put on their trousers and go to work deserved to be vaporized.<br /><br />This is the very anatomy of a diseased mind, of a degenerate nature, of a diseased soul.  Pick up 9/11 and read it: to bear witness to its madness is to serve as bailiff to the mind of Evil and insanity.

THE FOLLOWING IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF AN INTERCEPTED AND DECRYPTED ONE-WAY TRANSMISSION RELAYED FROM SAC-NORAD AT CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN TO THE WHITE HOUSE:(BEG. TRANSMISSION)<br /><br />My Dear George W.!---or should I call you POTUS? Or better still, shall I call you ZRggg'thl'ngh'aa, as I used to refer to you back in those cerulean-telium hazy days of our young reptilehood back on Neptune? At any rate, congratulations on the Election, and one thousand Weishauptian regrets for the tardy conveyance of my congratulations. I would have transmitted sooner, but I just back got in from the Deimos moon-base and you know how it is re-adjusting to Earth gravity. My hyper-baric chamber here in the Project Mandrake Level of Cheyenne Mountain is alright---it's got a nice steamy pool that reminds me of home---but I miss the roomy quarters, \\"human food\\" holding tanks, and flesh vats of Denver International Airport.<br /><br />Maybe I'll get back that way soon. Oh, and sorry we kept hush-hush about the Election results until the day after---we like 'em to be squeakers these days. Keeps the stupid humans at each other's throats and the boys back home love it. Hell, I bet if we moved up \\"Project Big Unveiling\\" to tomorrow, both the GOP and the Democrats would be all over each other to get our vote in time for the next elections.<br /><br />Stupid humans.<br /><br />Anyway, I wanted to write a quick note about David Icke's \\"The Biggest Secret: The Book that will Change the World\\". Talk about a goose walking over your grave---they never briefed me on this when I left Deimos. Hey, ever read Anne Rice's \\"Vampire Lestat\\", where the vampire guy is talking about how rattled his fellow vamps were at seeing \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" in print? That's how I felt when the USAF base commander showed me this thing Icke has written.<br /><br />Look, I know Headquarters is big into this \\"get it all out in the open\\" strategy these days---ya know, flood the zone with Bavarian Illuminati, Weishaupt, the Carlile Group, the Denver Airport and its \\"luggage conveyer belt\\" (even that gave me a giggle, I admit), the real builders of the Egyptian pyramids, the whole deal---it's the spaghetti effect, throw everything up on the wall and see what sticks. Information overload. Sensory overkill. When somebody pokes into the truth, the Public just assumes they're loopy. Aren't we calling it Project Art Bell these days? Brilliant, really classic.<br /><br />But now that I think about it, maybe dangerous. Icke's book lays it all out, George! Maybe I'm old fashioned, but is it really good having our whole New World Order game plan all over the Internet? I tell ya, it makes me long for the good old days of \\"you saw a weather balloon\\", Roswell denials, and our trusty little Men in Black. Things were so much simpler back in the fifties, when we let \\"Elvis\\" (good old Buba'buba'crkk'crkk---I saw him on leave at the Neptune station)ride shotgun on pop culture and the disgusting humans hadn't developed such a mental resistance to the Fluoride treatment.<br /><br />Listen, George, I'm gonna have to wrap this up soon; every time I get this detestably ugly human skin-suit, it always makes my scales break out in a nasty rash while I'm acclimating, and I can barely get my claws---I mean, \\"fingers\\"---to work on this human-sized keyboard. Ugh. The truth is, Icke makes me uneasy---ever see that flick \\"They Live\\"? Imagine what a small *army* of Rowdy Roddy Pipers could do to us (even though Piper was one of us---Ha!---the blind human fools!). I'm sure you get my drift.<br /><br />In summary, I think in my absence the grad-student wing of our Reptilian invasion vanguard has pushed it too far---the murals at DIA, the new \\"Star Wars\\" movies, the London Eye, cattle mutilations, Eminem's new CD---things are way out of control. The humans may be insects, George, but even an insect realizes when his wing is being pulled.<br /><br />For Cthulhu's sake, some of our fellow special ops are way too high profile: Babs Streisand and Michael Jackson are walking around in LA *without* their make-up, for Dagon's sake! Something has to be done, order has to be imposed. Michael Jackson actually *let* a film crew see him without a nose! Send someone in your wetworks division at the CIA to give *him* a good look at the man in the mirror, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />I guess in the final analysis Icke's book is the funniest thing since the \\"Nixon\\" (good old Bzzzzz'trat'trat'Ooble---how I miss him) presidency. Do you think any of the humans are onto the real kicker?---that Icke is one of us? He's being re-assigned to the Mars Genetic Research station, but the damage may already be done.<br /><br />Look, it boils down to this: put out a new Presidential Executive order. If we really *must* carve Masonic symbols into public buildings and put up murals that reveal through symbology all of our sinister plans---yeah, I know you guys think it's funny to rub it in the humans' sheeplike faces, but use a little restraint---we've got to be careful. From now on, put up our little \\"inside jokes\\" in public buildings that don't get a lot of scrutiny. Do it in public libraries, for instance---humans *never* go in there. Or maybe churches.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm off to a fine dinner of fricasseed lab-rat with a hardy helping of sauteed Earthling. I really hope this thing with Icke doesn't backfire, or it's my Dorsal Fin that's on the line. By the way, good job on bonding a little with \\"Hillary Clinton\\" (Ssszt'la-ik-blghhhh)---you guys actually seem collegal. I know you grew up on Mars and she grew up in the birthing vats of Venus, but remember: she's HQ's pick for 2008. Got it? You've got to get along.

Do you think any of the humans are onto the real kicker?---that Icke is one of us? He's being re-assigned to the Mars Genetic Research station, but the damage may already be done.    Look, it boils down to this: put out a new Presidential Executive order. If we really *must* carve Masonic symbols into public buildings and put up murals that reveal through symbology all of our sinister plans---yeah, I know you guys think it's funny to rub it in the humans' sheeplike faces, but use a little restraint---we've got to be careful. From now on, put up our little \\"inside jokes\\" in public buildings that don't get a lot of scrutiny. Do it in public libraries, for instance---humans *never* go in there. Or maybe churches.

That super-secret hush-hush Project the military was supposed to have under control has torn a rift into another dimension just ten miles from town, and maniacal flesh-hungry monsters are pouring through by the score, tearing their shrieking victims apart and turning the world as you know it into a charnel house. You've got to pack up and get outta Dodge quick---but what to take? Clothes, boots, food, hunting knife, guns and ammo, extra fuel cans, chainsaw---oh, and if you're a horror junkie like me, you've gotta have reading material during the Siege, right? And since you'll be holing up a long time---maybe forever---the tome you choose had better be a good one.<br /><br />Forced to haul one single volume off your horror shelf before you pack everything into the heavily armored civvie Hum-Vee, I would choose David G. Hartwell's masterful compilation \\"The Dark Descent.\\" This Leviathan of a book is chock-full of more than one-thousand pages of the best horror ever written by some of the Grand-Masters of the genre (H.P. Lovecraft, Poe, Stephen King, M.R. James) and some of their lesser known adepts and apprentices.  For such a modest price, having this much shivery, ghoulish goodness stuffed between the covers is nearly an embarrassment of riches.<br /><br />Anthologies are often treacherous ground, and success hinges on an editor's style and judgment. Hartwell demonstrates his impeccable taste and considerable acuity in the selections he makes; best of all he begins the collection with a remarkably astute, entertaining---and mercifully concise---little essay tracing the evolution of the terror and horror tale. Certainly we are treated to the seminal classics of the genre, and a few of the tales are overly represented in many other collections---but as horror crown jewels, they have their place here. H.P. Lovecraft is represented by two ensanguined ambassadors: \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\", a sweeping account of global panic, terror and slaughter spread by the resurgence of a primitive cult of an obscure Squid-God, and the Poe-esque \\"The Rats in the Walls\\". M.R. James has a less auspicious presence, \\"The Ash-Tree\\" being one of his less powerful works and an inadequate introduction to the Master.<br /><br />Hartwell's King selections are slightly puzzling; \\"The Reach\\" is too languid for its own good, while \\"The Monkey\\" is tacky and underawing---but then Hartwell knocks it out of the ballfield with the relatively rare Lovecraftian \\"Crouch End\\" which, serves up a viciously psychedelic and very different side of King, to say nothing of providing a little side-trip to a part of London (thankfully) not on any map.<br /><br />Karl Edward Wagner's \\"Sticks\\" presages by a quarter-century the discovery of liches in the woods by \\"Blair Witch\\"'s unlucky film students, Clive Barker details an experiment in mortal terror gone horribly awry in \\"Dread\\", Joyce Carol Oates proves there is a fate worse than Death in \\"Night-Side\\", and Lucy Clifford chronicles what happens to naughty little children in \\"The New Mother\\".<br /><br />There are at least ten riveting tales of vintage dread here, any one of which justifies the price of admission. If you haven't met late British terror-writer Robert Aickman, you have three opportunities in \\"Dark Descent\\", although \\"The Hospice\\" is by far the most ambiguous---and disquieting. \\"Seven American Nights\\", an apocalyptic travelogue written by a young Turkish man traveling through a wasted and genetically twisted future America, is by turns terrifying, acutely repulsive, and melancholy, a peculiarly potent spiked little horror-potion cloaked as travelogue by fantasy master Gene Wolfe. Taken together with Thomas Disch's disorienting \\"The Asian Shore\\", they might make you rethink getting away from the tour group the next time you spelunk through a strange land.<br /><br />Algernon Blackwood's \\"The Willows\\" conjures up the horror of the spheres that's moved its haunts to remote islands in the Danube; Walter de la Mare's \\"Seaton's Aunt\\" is a rich, deliciously unhinged little crawlfest instantly recognizable to anyone who has forced himself through an unpleasant evening with an unctuous, intimidating in-law.<br /><br />Hartwell includes a number of authors who rarely ventured into the horror genre: William Faulkner does Southern Gothic proud in \\"A Rose for Emily\\", Flannery O'Connor demonstrates the wisdom of never judging a book---even a Bible---by its cover in \\"Good Country People\\", and Edith Wharton whips up a kind of delayed-blast spook in \\"Afteward\\"---to say nothing of writing one of the finest ghost tales of all time.<br /><br />Hartwell makes some missteps, perhaps unavoidable in such a massive collection. Bishop's \\"Within the Walls of Tyre\\" is pretentious and dull, and \\"The Roaches\\", \\"If Damon Comes\\", and Philip K. Dick's time-twisting \\"Little Something for us Tempunauts\\" may give you chills, but they left me cold and bored. But these are forgivable lapses in a collection so varied and rich.<br /><br />One story in particular that I can't stop thinking about is Michael Shea's unexpected, grisly little delight \\"The Autopsy\\", about an aging, cancerous coroner called to a remote mountain town to conduct autopsies on the bodies of miners killed in a mysterious mine explosion---and who rapidly, terrifyingly shifts roles from examiner to subject. It's not a perfect story---not in style, nor even in its final revelation---but that said it's nasty, and remorselessly surgical, and you'll never forget it. Like most of the darksome little nuggets of terror in this vast volume, it's like a tooth you've had removed---you can't stop yourself from digging your tongue into the raw, fleshy gap.<br /><br />So remember---as civilization collapses and the howls of the mutated and deranged grow closer to your hideaway, throw the bolts, load the rifle, and tuck yourself in with \\"The Dark Descent\\"---at least you'll have the ultimate grimoire containing the very finest tales of terror until those crafty army scientists come up with a solution to save the day. And if they don't? Well, you *do* have 1,000 pages to tide you over.Walter de la Mare's \\"Seaton's Aunt\\" is a rich, deliciously unhinged little crawlfest instantly recognizable to anyone who has forced himself through an unpleasant evening with an unctuous, intimidating in-law. <br /> <br />Hartwell includes a number of authors who rarely ventured into the horror genre: William Faulkner does Southern Gothic proud in \\"A Rose for Emily\\", Flannery O'Connor demonstrates the wisdom of never judging a book---even a Bible---by its cover in \\"Good Country People\\", and Edith Wharton whips up a kind of delayed-blast spook in \\"Afteward\\"---to say nothing of writing one of the finest ghost tales of all time. <br /> <br />Hartwell makes some missteps, perhaps unavoidable in such a massive collection.

This is a tasty spiced October brew of ghosties and ghoulies and long-legged beasties, but in Campbell's England there are no Saints left to preserve us.<br /><br />\\"Darkest Part\\" starts with a peculiar kind of homecoming for the Price family.  The mad patriarch Lennox Price, presiding over a circle of his fellow inmates in a Brichester madhouse, issues a mysterious summons to his estranged wife Margo, a London artist starving for inspiration; stoic daughter Heather, now a university librarian struggling with her listless teenage son, Sam; and Sam himself, still wrestling with what he thought he saw as he camped in a tree shelter one night, something so vast and shadowy that he lurched off the platform in terror and snapped his leg.<br /><br />Lennox Price was formerly a brilliant toxicologist who came to the Goodmanswood in the Severn Valley to study a peculiar fungus in the depths of the forest. The most perilous Science has a habit of devouring the scientist, and Lennox promptly fell victim to the mind-warping hallucinogenic properties of the fungus he discovered, categorized, immortalized in print, and named; now he spends most of his days tittering and gazing across the lowering woodland outside the window of his sanatarium.<br /><br />Price's \\"invitation\\" is rather sneaky: the family converges on the insane asylum---known as the Arbour---where he is imprisoned, after Price's doctor telephones Margo with the warning that Lennox and his band of followers have escaped into the woods that surround the madhouse. Lennox is a uniter, not a divider: his nocturnal flight into the woods even manages to call up the Price family's other daughter, the more whimsicial Sophie, from her mysterious travels in America.  She arrives unannounced in Brichester days later, and bearing not a few secrets herself.<br /><br />When I was in graduate school in upstate New York I lived in a cottage that backed up directly onto a deep, dark woodland. I remember resting my eyes for a few minutes from my studies, and gazing out through my study windows at the lowering trees; practically every day I would go for long walks in the wood, meandering walks for the most part, but walks that would unfailingly lead me to a sort of central circle of ancient, gnarled giants, which held court around a huge, venerable maple. That tree had presence, power, authority: I nicknamed it \\"Grandfather Tree\\", and it became a centerpiece of my private mythology.<br /><br />I always found myself replenished, fortified, by these walks, but I never felt I had been alone in the lonely woodlands. On some nights, cast in a shroud of darkness by the New Moon, I unwelcome and would quicken my steps, as if intruding on some sylvan ritual, resented by the thick leafy groves and twisted, wooden sentries.<br /><br />Woods have an atavistic power---even Campbell's besieged Goodmanswood, its territory threatened by a new highway bypass, has something cloaked within, something corrupt, hungry, growing and eager to push its tendrils into neighboring Brichester. This is what I mean when I say that Campbell has returned to his old haunts. The very best of Campbell's horror derives much of its magic from the juxtaposition of the teeming, seedy, guttering modern United Kingdom with the ancient secrets that sleep fitfully below its new glittering plastic, steeland neon surface of superhighways and strip malls.<br /><br />Campbell is fascinated in the interplay between ancient and modern, between the horrible banality and tedium of contemporary life and the seething, soul-searing horror of the cancred tomb and unquiet grave. Campbell uses all the magic in his trunk to terrify the reader, and he is particularly intrigued by transformations. Can a family, ensconced in a nettle of horror and magic, ever truly be free of it? The neighbors, sensing the Price family drawn back to the haunted forest, turn on them, and yet what are the malformed, moon-pale heads peering up over log-piles and rock walls? What is the thing with burning hands and buzzing face that Sam glimpses in the woods? What of the elongated, pale \\"Sticky Man\\" the schoolgirls talk about in terrified whispers, growing taller and thinner with each full moon?<br /><br />The less said about the plot here, the better: this is a novel bursting at the seams with ideas, and Campbell lures the reader deeper into this forest at twilight, ever more mazelike with each page, ever more engrossing and disturbing, with its increasingly stealthy, sinister, and sneaky tale of ancient sorcery that flourished in Goodmanswood---named after the \\"Tall Man\\" that would show lost travelers out of the wood, or in darker tales, draw them farther in---sorcery, and worship, and secrets ancient when Rome was an infant.<br /><br />With that in mind, a word of caution: Campbell is no King or Koontz, and his terrors are subtle, almost reticent. A work by Campbell is a work of secrets cloaked in skin, bone, and earth, a work of layers, and it takes a while for \\"The Darkest Part of the Woods\\" to really pick up steam. Initially I was annoyed by its pace, and almost gave up on it.<br /><br />How fortunate for me---and unfortunate for my sleep---that I soldiered on! Campbell an admirer of classic ghost-tale wrangler M.R. James, uses many Jamesian techniques and draws on the ancient power of his silent, looming woods to craft up some delicious, mortifying terrors. There are two sequences late in the book---one involving a confused pursuit through the forest, the other involving a spelunk into the sooty, twisting cellar of a ruin---that are among the most terrifying ever set to paper.<br /><br />For all his deftness and misdirection, for all the creepy Autumn richness of this book, Campbell has written a work of sheer, skin-crawling horror. Like an October storm, \\"Darkest Part\\" starts up with a flurry of crinkled leaves, the kiss of a zephyr, the flash of heat lightning and the soft cough of far off thunder, and then---before you can get out of the way---you're caught up in the torrent and forced to seek shelter for the night in the forlorn cottage in the middle of the forest---in the very darkest part of the Woods.ng plastic, steel and neon surface of superhighways and strip malls. <br /> <br />Campbell is fascinated in the interplay between ancient and modern, between the horrible banality and tedium of contemporary life and the seething, soul-searing horror of the cancred tomb and unquiet grave.

US	52840999	R2POQ3Y1IXZOMM	1932382321	807524210	George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead	Books	1	21	24	N	N	Blood Thinner	When there's no more room in Hell, Steve Niles will walk the Earth---doing a panel-for-panel redraw of George Romero's \\"Dawn of the Dead.\\" If you're reading this, chances are you have an insatiable appetite for the Dead, and the very prospect of the prolific, imaginative Niles (who turned out the thin but entertaining \\"30 Days of Night\\") paired up with Romero's classic flesh-eaters makes you hungry. Hungry, if not for brains, then at least for a rousingly good graphic novel with ample amounts of blood, gore, brains, fear, loathing, and of course zombies.<br /><br />If that's what you're looking for, then you've come to the wrong place.<br /><br />I had just gleefully plucked up a copy of Anchor Bay's lavish \\"Dawn of the Dead Ultimate Edition\\" DVD set, and so my guard was down as I wandered into that wretched hive of scum and villainy, my local comics shop. That's exactly how guys get it in zombie flicks---they go into the dark warehouse without the shotgun, without a flashlight, totally unprepared. In seconds I was overpowered by the blood-red cover of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", captivated by the slack, staring eyes of a zombie, its hungry eyes devouring me from the cover, staring out of a crowd of the undead, their hands pressed up to tear my face off and devour me alive.<br /><br />In other words, I was dead meat.<br /><br />By the time I was infected---meaning, by the time I had bought the thing and taken it home with me---it was all over. Far from being thrilled, nervous, or satisfied, I felt bored, disappointed, and cheated. Worst of all, as I turned my blank-eyed, slack-jawed face up to the sky, I had nobody waiting with a shotgun to put me out of my misery.<br /><br />What do you get? 1) A panel-by-panel reshoot of \\"Dawn\\" comprising three \\"issues\\"---literally a redraw of the movie, from the frenzy at the newsroom, to the grisly raid on the Project, to the flight to the mall, and back onto the whirly-bird. If you've seen \\"Dawn'\\", then you know what you're getting---and you're getting no more than that. 2) A quick intro blurb by George Romero---he's getting royalties so you'd think he would give us something juicy, but it's barely a paragraph with a note of thanks to the design team---don't blink or you'll miss it. 3) A few pages of stills from the movie. Wow.<br /><br />Now, if you're like me, even the idea of a strict reshoot of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" in graphic novel form---with Niles at the helm---sounds intriguing. But sadly, Niles is so slavish in following the original film that there's absolutely nothing of interest here, no risks taken, no funky little sideroads explored. It was so dull that I dozed off about midway through, and finished the thing the next morning.<br /><br />The artwork is slightly amusing, though---artist Chee missed his calling doing airplane safety-pamphlets. The artwork here looks like it has uniformly been culled from the illustrations you can find in any 747 magazine holder, which to me (sicko that I am) is blackly funny. Imagine seeing those funny , unreal cartoon passengers sliding off a yellow airplane escape slide, being chased by the hungry living dead (drawn in the same style), and you pretty much have the artwork of \\"Dawn of the Dead.\\"<br /><br />Chee shoves the pedal down hard when it comes to the gore, but frankly---it's just too over the top and cartoonish to have much of an effect, and it's certainly not worth the price of admission. When Chee's red stuff starts flowing and viscera starts flying, it's not Gray's Anatomy---it's more like your mom's week-old lasagna. If that does it for you, dig in.<br /><br />The three issues bound here are also extremely bare-bones, so even some of the signature scenes from the movie---the zombie Hari-Krishna, for instance, who just makes a cameo appearance here---are cut from the comic. The only thing you get here that you won't get from Romero's classic is a single panel of an undead Elvis impersonator---great for a giggle, but not worth the cover price.<br /><br />There are fresher corpses in the graveyard, folks. Pass.orth the cover price.  <br /> <br />There are fresher corpses in the graveyard, folks. Pass.	2004-10-16

Ghost tale anthologies are always a mixed bag: a few tasty, grisly chillers to spike an otherwise tepid punch bowl of lackluster stories included to plump up the book and appease the publisher. \\"Meddling with Ghosts\\" provides no exception to the rule, but British horror grandmaster Ramsey Campbell keeps an exceptionally tight focus to his collection and consequently serves up the a few rare, ghoulish treasures amidst the fodder.<br /><br />Campbell (\\"Alone with the Horrors\\", \\"The Hungry Moon\\") is a horror-fiction giant in a landscape ridden with dwarves, and the best of his own writing has always drawn on the stylistic and thematic qualities of fellow English ghost-writer Montague Rhodes James, provost of Cambridge and Eton and a genius at crafting the true tale of the unsettling and bizarre.<br /><br />James has no equal in English letters when it comes to brewing up a terrifying tale, and : a common theme is the scholarly bachelor loner who, drawn to some remote locale, or forgotten tome, or garden folly found in his newly inheireted country home, stumbles on some ancient, reticent, mouldering secret thing and unleashes something unpleasant. Unpleasant for the bachelor-scholar-hero, that is---but gloriously fun for you, tucked under the bedclothes with the cat in the wee hours of the morning. With that in mind, \\"Meddling with Ghosts\\" assumes the reader has ample affection for James; if you haven't gotten a taste of M.R. James yet, then at the very least go read \\"Count Magnus\\", \\"Oh Whistle and I'll come to you, My Lad\\" and \\"Casting the Runes\\" to get a taste for the Old Master before you fork over lucre for this worshipful collection.<br /><br />Campbell sets up a few ground rules, all of them Jamesian: the stories in \\"Meddling\\" must involve malignant spirits, true horror, and an attention to historical detail. And James, more than any other horror writer, was a master when it came to conjuring up the truly unsettling, the brain-rattlingly wrong, with a minimum of prose. Stephen King has written \\"whenever possibly, I try to terrify---but when I can't terrify, I go for the gross-out.\\" James never had to settle for the gross-out, for his writing never fails to terrify.<br /><br />Campbell opens up with a puzzlingly brief introduction, which is terse but tastily creepy and appropriately sets the mood. \\"The Familiar\\", the first tale in the collection, is a rare piece by J. Sheridan LeFanu, but a few spooky bits aside was too dry to get my blood flowing. F. Marion Crawford's \\"The Upper Berth\\" is a rousing tale of spectral nastiness, but it really isn't very Jamesian, has been anthologized a million times, and you've probably read it by now. \\"Let Loose\\", \\"Death Mask\\", \\"The Red House\\", and \\"The Moon Gazer\\" are grindingly dull, and \\"Thurnley Abbey\\", while fleetingly spooky, is the ghost-tale equivalent of going out for Japanese food: 15 minutes later and you'll be hungry again.<br /><br />But there are supple, scary treasures here. \\"Petey\\", by the inimitable T.E.D. Klein, is intensely Jamesian and frankly terrifying, and will have you making sure the curtains are pulled tight. Sabine Baring-Gould's \\"Glamr\\" is only scantly Jamesian, and yet is, in my opinion, not Jamesian at all, but I confess a weakness for terror tales from the Scandinavian mountains, and besides---once you read it you'll understand---as bad a troll as the awful Glamr is, how much more nasty is the unnamed dead thing that killed him out in the frozen wastes beneath the mountain?<br /><br />The two best tales in \\"Meddling\\" are worth the price of admission alone: Campbell apprentice Terry Lamsley's \\"Two Returns\\" accomplished the twofold task of freezing my blood cold (his story is a masterwork of icy grue) and introducing me to his work, and Campbell's own \\"The Guide\\", omitted from his larger collection \\"Alone with the Horrors\\", is archetypically Jamesian, and centers on the all-too-curious author himself and---well, an *admirer*.<br /><br />Campbell finishes off the collection with Rose Pardoe's scrupulously detailed bibliography of ghost-tale writers who have incorporated Jamesian elements, all tasty stuff to be sure and thoroughly researched.<br /><br />So if you're still wrestling with yourself as to whether you should buy it, wrestle no further and give in. Settle in beneath the covers, turn down the lamp, listen to the wind howl and the tree branches fumble and claw at your bedroom window, and settle in to \\"Petey\\" or \\"The Guide\\". What's a few pence compared to a night of pleasant terror, anyway?

The Master at work.	\\"Desperation\\" is one of Stephen King's finest works, a riveting scream of a horror novel that gets right to work, grabs the reader by the throat, and insists, all 500+ pages of gore-dripping goodness of it, on being read straight thru 'til morning.<br />The secret of Uber-horror writer Stephen King's success is amazingly, masterfully, insidiously simple: he takes harmless little slices from ordinary life and then, bit by bit, lets the Horror seep in. Certainly King's world features ghosts, vampires, deranged scientists, spooks, dopplegangers and madmen galore, but the protagonists are every-day, commonplace men and women who venture out of their sun-dappled suburban subdivisions to do battle with Evil.<br />King plays a fine riff on this eternally yummy and harrowing theme in \\"Desperation\\", which begins as Peter and Mary Jackson, driving back to New York from a trip with relatives in the Pacific Northwest, get pulled over by a policeman on a particularly desolate Nevada stretch of Highway 50, the loneliest highway in America.<br />See, that's it, right there: King knows that it's a peculiar, highly particular, completely inimitable, spooky and slinky funny feeling you get down in the pit of your stomach when you peer into the rear-view mirror and see those red-and-blue police flashers. It's embarrassing, being pulled over, and it's---let's admit it---just a little scary and confusing. You know exactly where your driver's license and registration is, but you fumble it all the same, don't you, while the stony-faced trooper is peering in, maybe shining a flashlight into your car's interior.<br />Looking for---what? Guns? Drugs? Bodies in the trunk?<br />Anyway, King moves at 120 miles per hour into the guts of this grim little Nevada spookshow creepfest, introducing us to an interesting variation of the American nightmare: the Super-sized Highway Patrolman with a *really* bad attitude.

US	52840999	RAVIB5BR99XX6	0743224876	831264336	Confessions of a Street Addict	Books	5	28	32	N	N	Like a shot of Adrenaline: high-octane exciting read!	James J. Cramer, opinionated and bellicose founder of the Street.com and hedge fund manager distills his fire-breathing personality and stock-market enthusiasm and serves it up in this riveting and compulsively readable tell-all of Cramer's life and times on Wall Street.<br />Cramer rips through his early life as a young Pennsylvania kid fascinated with stocks, zips through his years as an undergrad and burgeoning journalist at Harvard, shoots through his days as a rookie reporter at the L.A. Herald Examiner and his nights sleeping in a battered Ford Fairmont---and by page 14, we're already knee-deep in Cramer's passion, the stock market.<br />Cramer writes engagingly and keeps up a roaring pace, and reading his material is like being ensconced inside the guy's feverish, always calculating head. It's about as close as most will come to having a seat at a hedge-fund trading desk, and whether you're just interested in the Market or have years of experience, you'll find \\"Confessions\\" a tasty and addicting read.<br />The writing is amazingly candid, and the most refreshing thing about \\"Confessions\\", apart from the fact that it's rippingly good fun and fine writing, is Cramer's honesty. For all his bluster and arrogance, and for all his consumptive attention to outperforming the indexes and his rivals (and for better than 13 years, his hedge fund Cramer Berkowitz did just that) Cramer is willing to accept the lion's share of the blame here. Who threw bottled water and telephones at the heads of his henchmen on bad trading days? Who pancicked and wrote a capitulatory \\"get out NOW!\\" article on TheStreet.com on October 8th, 1998, just as the worst had occurred and the markets were beginning the roaring rally that would not end until 2000? Who, surprisingly, had abolutely no clue what was going on in the company he had poured his name and his money into, and didn't have any kind of feel for the circus of the coming IPO?<br />Cramer, Cramer, and Cramer. There are really three Jim Cramers in \\"Confessions\\": Cramer the trader, Cramer the stock-market commentator and journalist, and Cramer the dot-com businessman and New Economy darling. Guess which \\"Cramer\\" gets him in the most trouble?<br />But let's cut to the chase: \\"Confessions of a Street Addict\\" is loads of fun and a wild perch to look out on what has been a real revolution in the financial markets; Cramer's honesty, experience, wide-ranging connections and candor make this the funniest and most introspective book on Wall Street since Mike Lewis wrote \\"Liar's Poker\\"---and hey, Lewis even has a cameo role in \\"Confessions\\", in which he's credited with coming up with the name \\"TheStreet\\" for the company that became TheStreet.com.<br />That's just one character in a roster that looks like Who's Who of Wall Street, 1982-2003: Cramer meets up, socializes, trades and schemes with Robert Rubin, Roger Ailes, Joe \\"The Big Kahuna\\" Kernan, David \\"The Brain\\" Faber, and Mark Haynes.<br />He crosses swords with Barron's Alan Abelson and Money's Frank Lalli, and engages in the time-honored Wall Street passtime of making fun of the corrupt Dan Dorfmann. During his Harvard Law years, he works as a research grunt for high-powered defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, putting together briefs on the Klaus von Bulow case (and, apparently, played by \\"some Indian guy\\" in the movie \\"Reversal of Fortune\\"). He gets interviewed by Oliver Stone's research henchmen when he's a salesman at Goldman Sachs, and, according to Cramer, serves as Stone's inspiration for getting Buddy Fox in to meet Gordon Gekko in \\"Wall Street\\". He even opens his uber-restrictive hedge fund up for redemptions when a major client, Elliot Spitzer (then running for Attorney General of New York), asks to withdraw some funds to fuel his campaign, and suffers a nearly disastrous run on the fund that almost swamped him.<br />But the real attraction of \\"Confessions\\" is the way Cramer weaves his life and career into the seminal events that have defined modern Wall Street and moved us through a financial revolution, and we get a trench-level tour of the really seismic events: the 1987 Black Monday crash, buying into the 1991 Iraqi war, the implosion of Long Term Capital Management, the Asian Contagion and Russian collapse that nearly ended a 16-year old Bull Market, and the stock bubble that defined the twilight years of the \\"New\\" Economy.<br />Having read \\"Confessions\\", I thank God for a man like Jim Cramer: it shows me our hard-charging capitalist system is still working if it can produce a man like him. Cramer's chief virtue is that he says what's on his mind, an attribute, noble as it is, that got him in trouble in the SmartMoney event that he chronicles. In a way, Cramer is like Wall Street's answer to G. Gordon Liddy, a man who says and does what he pleases, and damn the torpedoes.<br />And Cramer is, was, and always will be a tireless and funny stock promoter, and his enthusiasm is infectious: if you aren't already gunning for equities and watching that ticker, you will be after you read this book---just be careful to take the lessons herein to heart.<br />\\"Confessions of a Street Addict\\" is a high-octane shot of raw adrenaline and compulsively addicting, and provides a 20 year ride inside the mind of a premier hedge fund manager---for that alone, it's worth the price of admission.e defined modern Wall Street and moved us through a financial revolution, and we get a trench-level tour of the really seismic events: the 1987 Black Monday crash, buying into the 1991 Iraqi war, the implosion of Long Term Capital Management, the Asian Contagion and Russian collapse that nearly ended a 16-year old Bull Market, and the stock bubble that defined the twilight years of the \\"New\\" Economy. <br />Having read \\"Confessions\\", I thank God for a man like Jim Cramer: it shows me our hard-charging capitalist system is still working if it can produce a man like him.

US	52840999	R1SYD0IIP3G88V	0679777547	582743995	The Club Dumas	Books	5	11	13	N	N	Like drinking brandy in a dark room of a Secret Libary	That's the feeling I get with this erudite, mesmerizing, creepy little tome by Spanish bibliophile Arturo Perez-Reverte: the book is deliciously rich and positively reeks of forbidden knowledge, and the sensation one gets while leafing through its pages (hopefully you can purloin a hardback edition)is akin to having a good pipe over brandy in a darkened, hidden room of a secret library.<br />There is a handful of authors who are entranced by history, but view it not with the mortician or embalmer's eye so much as the explorer's: history is not so much a fixed narrative as it is an amazing necropolis, a labyrinith, a series of catacombs winding beneath the present. Umberto Eco is such a writer; John Crowley is another; and happily for \\"The Club Dumas\\", Perez-Reverte is still another. For Perez-Reverte, there are many secret entrances and recondite passages linking the adventurer in the present to the dubious past.  For the Lucas Corso, rare-book dealer and protagonist of \\"Club Dumas\\", the trick, having gotten through one of these hidden apertures, lies in getting himself out again with skin, and soul, intact.<br />The book begins with Madrid book-seller and rogue Lucas Corso having been presented with two mysteries: one, an unpublished chapter from \\"The Three Musketeers\\" called \\"The Anjou Wine\\" and reputedly written by Alexandre Dumas, sold by the book collector Enrique Taillefer hours before his suicide. The other is his commission from book dealer and magnate Varo Borga, who wants Corso to travel across Europe in an effort to determine whether Borga's copy of \\"The Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows\\", a grimoire printed by 17th century Venetian printer Archimedes Torchia, is a forgery or authentic.<br />Two mysteries for the price of one, and we haven't even talked about \\"The Nine Gates\\" yet. Corso is told that only three copies of the grimoire exist: Borga's, one in the crumbling Portuguese estate of Victor Fargas, and one in the Paris townhouse of Baroness Frieda Ungern, specialist in the occult. Oh yes: \\"The Nine Gates\\" is an infamous work, chiefly because it contains everything a wizard needs to summon up Satan himself. Why is Borga interested in authenticating his copy, again?<br />The attentive reader and cinephile will know that Roman Polanski chose \\"The Club Dumas\\" as the source material for his fine and thrilling film \\"The Ninth Gate\\", but while Polanski distilled the raw (and diabolic) elements from the book, \\"The Club Dumas\\" contains far juicier (though quirky, whimsical, and eccentric) fare. Like Umberto Eco, Perez-Reverte is not an author in a hurry, and he's more than happy to take his reader on a saunter down a curious (though shadow haunted) literary lane.<br />One difference between the film and the book is the character of Corso himself: the character in the book is infinitely more complex, sad, and interesting. Corso is a rogue in search of lucre, true, but he's also a man bereft of his love who spends his idle hours wargaming, re-fighting the Napoleonic campaigns (particularly the Battle of Waterloo), and winning for his beloved Emperor, to say nothing of avenging his French grenadier ancestor.<br />Another difference is the way in which the Dumas manuscript figures in the story, entwining itself with the hunt for the diabolic grimoire, and playing with Corso's literary fancies: the shadowy pursuers become the emissaries of Dumas's fiendish Milady de Winter, while a skulking, lurking, mustachioed rogue becomes the Three Musketeers' nemesis Rochefort. And don't worry, even the villainous Cardinal Richelieu makes an appearance.<br />The result is a heady and luxurious read, full of whimsy and erudition---but don't let that fool you. Beneath the meandering turns into Dumas, Dickens, and Melville, among the interested musings on the fate of the old Ogre of Corsica, lies the book's dark diabolic soul that so fascinated Polanski. Perez-Reverte neatly binds the disparate threads of his narrative up, and the ending is more explicit and troubling than that of the movie.<br />Light your pipe, fill your snifter with brandy, and make sure that secret door to the main library is locked: you'll want to make sure you're undisturbed as you savor \\"The Club Dumas\\". Just don't try any of the incantations.e ending is more explicit and troubling than that of the movie. <br />Light your pipe, fill your snifter with brandy, and make sure that secret door to the main library is locked: you'll want to make sure you're undisturbed as you savor \\"The Club Dumas\\".

His life depends on keeping up a charade, on cloaking his intentions and lying about his work. He can trust no one but himself, and he keeps an eagle eye on himself.<br />To make matters worse, a botched defection at the Berlin Wall sends Leamas's career into free fall, prompting his recall to London, a subsequent reassignment to a desk job in Personnel, and, simultaneously, the hatching of one of British intelligence chief Control's more byzantine little schemes: use Leamas's fall from grace as a means of ferreting out and destroying Hans Dieter Mundt, a high-ranking East German master spy and Leamas's shadowy nemesis.<br />To say more would be unfair to the reader. Le Carre, himself a former British intelligence officer, is perfectly suited to composing the elaborate, excruciating fencing match between London and Moscow that lies at the heart of so many of his best tales. The typical Le Carre protagonist and his handlers are not James Bondian pulp heroes with Union Jacks painted on the pommel of their 9MM Walther PPKs; instead, they tend to be bland, non-descript ciphers, poker-faced and cynical creatures who hide their machinations under bland exteriors.<br />\\"The Spy\\" is Le Carre at his deftest, and the Cold War at its coldest. Leamas is re-introduced into the world as a potential defector, but his ruse is haunted by the unexpected relationship with a British librarian he leaves behind in London. And really, the relationship, and the emotions it awakens in this grizzled Cold Warrior, is what makes \\"Spy\\" so compulsively entertaining and riveting: Alec Leamas wants to love and to reveal himself, just as his East German interrogator Fiedler wants desperately to believe in the purity of the Revolution and in the ideals of Communism.<br />But this is a Le Carre novel, and ideals and emotions are the luxuries of the dead or the doomed.<br />\\"The Spy\\" has the advantage of excellent pacing and deft characterization, and as with many of Le Carre's best novels, it manages to condense a considerable amount of treachery in a minimum of exposition. Le Carre is not only a good storyteller and a master at plotting out the grim duel between his spies, he is also a consummately gifted writer who uses words like a surgeon uses a scalpel. Best of all, \\"The Spy\\" is a nastily clever work, in which the plot turns in on itself suddenly and viciously, casting some light on a dark arena in which no one can be trusted.<br />\\"The Spy who Came in From the Cold\\" is a classic in espionage and a timeless literary masterpiece, but it is also a ruthless and jolting work whose cynicism is horrific. It is a bracingly good read and completely unforgettable.es \\"Spy\\" so compulsively entertaining and riveting: Alec Leamas wants to love and to reveal himself, just as his East German interrogator Fiedler wants desperately to believe in the purity of the Revolution and in the ideals of Communism. <br />But this is a Le Carre novel, and ideals and emotions are the luxuries of the dead or the doomed. <br />\\"The Spy\\" has the advantage of excellent pacing and deft characterization, and as with many of Le Carre's best novels, it manages to condense a considerable amount of treachery in a minimum of exposition.

AVOID	Oxford University Press has committed an outrage---a violation!---and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves. Montague Rhodes James (1865-1936) is, for me, the Grand Master of the Terrifying Tale, and for those not acquainted with his works---well, I envy you the chilling delight of meeting up with James's menacing, atmospheric prose for the first time. Read the tales and relish their keen sense of terror, which belies the avuncular, scholarly style and antiquarian sensibilities in which James was so well-versed.<br />That said, it's a shame that so many readers will encounter James for the first time in Oxford's new collection of \\"Casting the Runes & Other Ghost Stories\\", which is the cheesiest, shoddiest edition of James's work I have ever encountered. In light of James's dark brilliance, this slipshod edition is the equivalent of serving Kristal Champagne in a plastic coke bottle, or offering Sevruga caviar from a tuna can.<br />I was initially excited at getting all of my favorite Jamesian tales of terror bound up in a new hardback volume from OUP. Imagine my intial shock when the tiny tome arrived---and I do mean TINY. Check out those book dimensions carefully, folks: this edition is a teensy vanity hardback about the size of the little abridged poetry volumes booksellers stock during the holidays for stocking stuffers, usually kept at the cash register.<br />Think about that for a second. Think about getting twenty-three James tales, 293 pages in total, into a teeny-tiny little book. Think of just how miniscule the print on those stories would have to be, or how absent the book would have to be of anything resembling normal margins.<br />Well, think about it, and then think hard before wasting your money on this edition, because this is pretty much M.R. James for Lilliputians. I have 20/20 vision and I need a magnifying glass to read the type comfortably. Oh, and remember all the scholarly annotations supplied by James scholar Michael Cox in the previous edition? As one reviewer noted, the asterisks are still there, but the annotations have been gutted.<br />Even better, apparently to save on paper and space the Oxford editors, in their infinite wisdom, cut out the James essay \\"Stories I Have Tried to Write\\" that appeared in the previous edition. Mind you, this is an essay that has graced *every* edition of \\"Casting the Runes\\" since the first publishing run, and they just---cut it out.<br />Oh, it gets better. In place of the erudite Cox, we now have Michael Chabon's witless introduction, in which Chabon appears eager to show how many literary works he is familiar with, but proves unable to get the name of James's protagonist in \\"Oh Whistle and I'll Come to You, Lad\\" right. Given that Chabon professes in the first sentence of his review that \\"Oh Whistle\\" is one of the finest short stories ever written, one would think M. Chabon would realize the name of the story's hero is Parkins, not Parke.<br />This edition is so shabby, cheap, and shoddy as to make even the most fervent bibliophile yearn for a good book-burning. James deserves better, and I hope his ghost haunts Oxford University Press.vious edition?

I had great profs, true, but they were teaching theoretical concepts from theoretical textbooks. Sure, you learned the basics: CAPM, net present value, basic options and futures, Arbitrage Pricing Theory, VAR and TEV, but I have always maintained that the best way of learning a subject---particularly corporate finance---is by getting your hands dirty and digging into the guts of the material.<br />Since Corporate Finance, off-balance sheet instruments aside, isn't very dirty, the best way to get a hands-on practical approach in terms of Capital Structure, the appropriate discount rate to use in pricing an asset, risk, and optimal debt and dividends is to program in Excel and Visual Basic. The problem is that many top finance texts don't offer supplemental material to translate the theoretical concepts into actual valuation and spreadsheet models, which any financial analyst will contend is the life-blood of the industry.<br />With that in mind, Simon Beninga's \\"Financial Modelling\\" is a kind of \\"Joy of Cooking\\" for initiate investment bankers, corporate financiers, controllers, analysts, and anyone who wants to use core Corporate Finance concepts in the real world. Beninga goes through the standard laundry list of Corporate Finance text topics---from the optimal risky portfolio to the term structure of interest rates---and shows you how to translate these concepts into workable spreadsheet models that can illustrate, illuminate, and get to the heart of a problem.<br />If you're a new MBA or financial analyst, you'll find much to love in Beninga's approach, and by pairing the newly expanded 2nd edition up with a top theoretical finance textbook (Ross, Westerfield et al.'s \\"Corporate Finance\\" is a fine example) you'll get the most out of your MBA program and have a solid foundation for building Excel and Visual Basic financial models that work.<br />I liken \\"Financial Modeling\\" to a cookbook, in that Beninga provides all the ingredients necessary to the model at hand: he begins with a sprinkling of theory, whether it's modeling a bond portfolio's immunization, calculating the cost of capital, estimating a portfolio's Beta with no short-selling, or pricing put and call options using both the binomial theorem and Black-Scholes. His writing is spare, terse, and to the point, but I have learned more about advanced corporate finance theory through Beninga's marvellously pithy writing and copious Excel examples than I have in reading ten 'top of the list' finance books.<br />In addition to nicely expanded sections on options (including portfolio insurance) and leasing (including the technically sophisticated subject of leveraged leasing, which requires Excel to comprehend), Beninga concludes his sprightly little tome with a section on getting the most out of Excel (useful little shortcuts that a financial analyst will need but may not have heard of) and a nice little introductory primer on programming in Visual Basic.<br />\\"Financial Modeling\\" is an absolute essential if you're going to make Corporate Finance your profession. For an equally elegant and practical treatment of building discounted cash flow models for businesses, the reader would be advised to pick up Beninga's \\"Corporate Finance\\", which, while not equally oriented in spreadsheet modeling, is one of the most terse, accessible, and reasonably technically sophisticated Corp-Fin books on the market today.in Beninga's approach, and by pairing the newly expanded 2nd edition up with a top theoretical finance textbook (Ross, Westerfield et al.'s \\"Corporate Finance\\" is a fine example) you'll get the most out of your MBA program and have a solid foundation for building Excel and Visual Basic financial models that work. <br />I liken \\"Financial Modeling\\" to a cookbook, in that Beninga provides all the ingredients necessary to the model at hand: he begins with a sprinkling of theory, whether it's modeling a bond portfolio's immunization, calculating the cost of capital, estimating a portfolio's Beta with no short-selling, or pricing put and call options using both the binomial theorem and Black-Scholes.

Let's cut to the chase: if you like tautly paced little terror tales loaded with atmosphere, then you should buy \\"Dark Ladies.\\"<br />Fritz Leiber was a Grand Master of Fantasy and Terror fiction, and I pretty much grew up on the sly and cynical exploits of his Sword & Sworcery adventurers Fafhrd & the Grey Mouser. Leiber's stories seemed to my adolescent mind to be more worldly, more sophisticated, than the Conan or Tarl Cabot sagas I devoured when I was 12; Fafhrd and the Mouser were themselves street-smart and cunning, dispatching mortal and demonic foes with a style and alacrity usually lacking in other Sword & Sorcery epics.<br />Leiber brought that same sense of style and airiness of prose to his terror tales as well, and \\"Dark Ladies\\" is a fine example of his literary wizardry over the span of three decades: the book contains two superlative tales of sorcery and the malevolently supernatural intruding into modern life, \\"Conjure Wife\\" (written in 1943) and \\"Our Lady of Darkness\\" (1978). Both tales are linked by the thread of sorcery, to be sure, but are also reflective of Leiber's tremendous debt to both H.P. Lovecraft and M.R. James: they are heavily atmospheric, pulse with ghostly malevolence, and have at their center unassuming, mild-mannered scholarly protagonists who are unwittingly and reluctantly drawn into dark adventures.<br />I must confess that I read \\"Conjure Wife\\" last, anticipating that it wouldn't be very interesting. It deals with Norman Saylor, a senior professor of Sociology at a small university in rural New Jersey who discovers his wife is a witch. As a rational thinker, Saylor is appalled, and orders his wife to give up her sorcery immediately; she does so, and the fun begins. From the premise, I wasn't very excited; the story seemed a little too \\"Bewitched\\" to be scary.<br />I'm happy to report that I was wrong, and \\"Conjure Wife\\" is one of the nastiest, most riveting, and frightening little gems of pure horror ever written.  The kind of tale that has you glancing nervously at dark corners, \\"Conjure Wife\\" was a pleasure to read, though the ending came far too quickly and left me wanting more.<br />\\"Our Lady of Darkness\\", surprisingly, is the weaker tale of the two, though it was equally atmospheric. San Francisco horror writer Franz Westen, looking at the ragged hilltop of Corona Heights through binoculars, spies a pale, lean, brownish figure cavorting on the hill, which appears to wave at him. The next day he hikes up to the hill; finding no one there, he turns the binoculars on his apartment, two miles away; to his horror the figure appears in his own window, waving back at him!<br />This tale is erudite and exciting, and plunges Westen into the occult theories of Thibaut de Castries, who lived in San Francisco at the turn of the century and was at the center of a secret society of famous writers, including Jack London and Clark Ashton Smith. More interesting, the story delves into de Castries' notions of megapolisomancy, the theory that cities conjure up unhealthy and malignant energies of their own. Poor Westen has drawn the attention of such a creature, and the tale becomes a kind of scholarly cat and mouse.<br />Like \\"Conjure Wife\\", \\"Our Lady of Darkness\\" ends far too swiftly, and leaves the reader wanting more. I would imagine that's a fairly insignificant criticism, and it's certainly better to leave a reader wanting more than the reverse. \\"Our Lady of Darkness\\" is also a studied homage to the works of both M.R.

San Francisco horror writer Franz Westen, looking at the ragged hilltop of Corona Heights through binoculars, spies a pale, lean, brownish figure cavorting on the hill, which appears to wave at him. The next day he hikes up to the hill; finding no one there, he turns the binoculars on his apartment, two miles away; to his horror the figure appears in his own window, waving back at him!<br />This tale is erudite and exciting, and plunges Westen into the occult theories of Thibaut de Castries, who lived in San Francisco at the turn of the century and was at the center of a secret society of famous writers, including Jack London and Clark Ashton Smith. More interesting, the story delves into de Castries' notions of megapolisomancy, the theory that cities conjure up unhealthy and malignant energies of their own. Poor Westen has drawn the attention of such a creature, and the tale becomes a kind of scholarly cat and mouse. <br />Like \\"Conjure Wife\\", \\"Our Lady of Darkness\\" ends far too swiftly, and leaves the reader wanting more. I would imagine that's a fairly insignificant criticism, and it's certainly better to leave a reader wanting more than the reverse. \\"Our Lady of Darkness\\" is also a studied homage to the works of both M.R. James and H.P. Lovecraft, though his tale fails to achieve the soul-curdling terror of either of those masters.<br />That said, if you're looking for the perfect spooky book to curl up with beside a roaring fire (preferably with a sleeping cat on the other sofa, and lightning flashing outside), then \\"Dark Ladies\\" is for you.	2003-06-25

For instance, there is \\"The Chair\\", a nasty little shocker about a deformed and lonely chairmaker who gives in to his fantasy of being sealed up in a chair of his own making: at first to steal from the hotel in which the chair is placed, and then, by degrees, to derive his own pleasure from the sensation of being so close, separated only by cloth and leather, from the bodies of those who sit in the chair.<br />There are two other stories in this little volume that approach the raw grue of \\"The Chair\\": \\"Two Crippled Men\\", a tale of somnambulism and trickery, and \\"Caterpillar\\", a nasty, perverse little story about a woman and her horribly maimed husband, a veteran with no limbs and no ability to hear or speak; this last story resembles in form and in tone the classic French 'contes-cruelles', where the greatest of horror is found, not in the supernatural, but in the perversities and nastiness that men practice on their neighbors, friends, and lovers.<br />The other tales in the book are variations on the same theme: committing the perfect crime. These are typically well staged, slightly eerie, and all make good use of their Japanese settings, but ultimately the redundancy becomes tiresome, and the stories lack that nasty final bite that characterizes the true tale of terror. Even with the stunning \\"Chair\\", Rampo manages to undermine his own ending, sapping the tale's initial unsettling power.<br />\\"The Chair\\" is unique; it is hard to imagine a similar horror tale that manages to creep under the skin so effectively; for that reason, I give Rampo's little volume 3 stars. If you're intrigued by the prospect of \\"The Chair\\" and \\"The Caterpillar\\", then by all means buy the book, but don't expect Rampo's other tales to have the pungency of evil and the thrill of these first two stories.book are variations on the same theme: committing the perfect crime.

How do I hate \\"Prey:a Novel\\"?----let me count the ways.<br />1) Michael Crichton's tale of nanotechnology is crammed full of filler and fluff; indeed, the first 1/3 of the book (sadly the best part) has nothing to do with nanotechnology, and everything to do with our protagonist Jack's life of house-husbandry and slowly (ever so....slowly) crumbling marriage. Even the *title* of the book is fluffy, for pity's sake: \\"Prey: a Novel\\"???? A Novel? As distinguished from what, \\"Prey: a Coloring Book\\"?<br />2) Fluff, if it's well-written, can be good, if it is used in the service of a higher goal and the novel pays off. Sadly, the novel does not. In a nutshell, the plot: Jack, unemployed computer programmer and devoted house-husband of Julia, worries (for 1/3 of the book) about his fraying marriage, and Julia's increasing distraction and strange behavior.<br />You see, Julia, a senior executive of biotech start-up Xymos, is evincing the signs of a woman having an affair. She's distracted, she's cranky, she's irritable, she's distant, she works late and takes a shower when she gets home---and she's starting to really shape up! After his wife's car accident, Jack finds out the lovely Julia has been spending entire days at Xymo's microchip fabrication plant, and gets hired as a consultant to figure out what's going on.<br />What's going on? The Gentle Reader can probably figure it out. Xymos, you see, is making little biomechanical machines on a nano (extremely small) scale, and the little devils have gotten out of control. When Jack gets to the lab, the little devils (actually nano-sized military cameras for battlefield surveillance) are outside the lab---but for how long? Worse, because nanotechnology replicates, they're breeding---a little swarm of nano-cameras buzzing all over the desert, and they're not out to have you say 'cheese.'<br />3) If I've made \\"Prey: A Novel\\" sound more exciting than it is, and I have, then I'm sorry. We've seen all of this before in Jurassic Park, except that book was fresh and interesting. This is just a boring rehash, a book that dissolves into a frantic chase when our hero gets to the lab and finds the little velociraptors (I'm sorry, nanomachines) devouring anyone they can find. Go ahead and slog through the first 1/3rd of the book hoping for a payoff---you'll regret it.<br />4) Nanotechnology is an exciting concept that many companies have already employed; doubtless we'll see more extensive and imaginative applications of it in our lifetime. But Crichton has taken this marvellous concept (with its ominous implications, as both K. Eric Drexler and Greg Bear have suggested) and turned it into a monster-of-the-week novel---and a long, tedious, boring read, at that.<br />If you want to see what the nanotechnology-gone-horribly-wrong theme looks like in the hands of a master, then grab the appalling and unsettling \\"Blood Music\\", by Greg Bear.

Let's say you're seriously twisted and you want to become an investment banker; you get admitted into a top MBA program, prepare yourself for two years of High Finance boot camp, and hop a plane to the school of your choice. Bad news---the plane crashes, and you spend two years on a deserted island before going to Wall Street. What three books do you wish you'd packed away before your flight?<br />If you're like me, \\"Corporate Finance\\" is one of them. The world of financial publishing is a vicious and nasty little gladiatorial arena where a few steely-eyed finance texts shed blood and greenbacks vying for MBA-school presence. But if you're a new MBA, if you're a finance major contemplating a career on Wall Street or business school, or if you just want to lay a nice foundation in core Corporate Finance concepts, \\"Corporate Finance\\" is a must-have work.<br />What professors Ross, Westerfield, and Jaffe have done here is remarkable, and possibly a miracle in the often turgid world of finance publishing: they have turned out a remarkably cogent, clear, concise, yet detailed workbook designed to help MBAs and Finance BAs get the most out of core financial concepts like CAPM, Equity Valuation, Present Value, Bond math, options theory, Risk, and Financial Analysis.<br />All of the vital Corporate Finance theory is covered in crisp language, studded with useful examples, and punctuated by real-world economics, finance, and accounting illustrations; there are also topical articles on essential concepts that shed additional, and practical, light on areas that typically confuse finance novices (the section on Net Present Value and its theoretical competitors is particularly solid).<br />Capital Structure, Financial Risk, Valuation, Dividend Theory, and Option Theory are all covered in detail, and the clarity, quality, and comprehensiveness of these sections are all excellent. For students struggling with other MBA-level textbooks that purport to cover the basics, here's the bottom line: stop struggling and buy this book.<br />One caution: Corporate Finance is a foundation book, meaning that it is best used to gain a broad, solid understanding of the key concepts in Corporate Finance and Investment Banking. This is not an Excel-oriented or modelling-based text, nor does it approach subjects like Bond analysis or Options Theory with anything like the academic depth of a John Hull or Frank Fabozzi.<br />That said, Corporate Finance provides an excellent basis for a broad and deep knowledge of modern corporate financial theory; it covers all the essentials, and it does its job thoroughly, engagingly, and very competently. It is crisp, concise, user-friendly, and comprehensive, a rarity in finance textbooks.<br />Oh---the other two Desert Island MBA books, you ask? Easy: Mike Lewis's hysterical \\"Liar's Poker\\" and Simon Beninga's invaluable \\"Financial Modeling\\".e bottom line: stop struggling and buy this book. <br />One caution: Corporate Finance is a foundation book, meaning that it is best used to gain a broad, solid understanding of the key concepts in Corporate Finance and Investment Banking.

Greg Bear is a consummately gifted science fiction thinker, an author more interested in the unintended consequences of wayward scientific theories and ideas than he is in plotting, character, description, dialogue, and flow of the action. Occasionally the idea is so compelling that this is forgivable, as with Bear's brilliant, gripping, terrifying and oddly optimistic \\"Blood Music\\", which starts out as a nanotechnological horror story and ends up playing with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.<br />Darwin's Radio, sadly, is not such a book. In one sense it is typical Bear, in that the Big Scary Scientific Idea at the center of the book is engaging and forces the reader to think through the implications. The trouble, of course, is that the author pays too much attention to the idea behind Darwin's Radio---discontinous evolution---and too little attention to character development. The result is a book that is hard to get into, hard to stay interested in, and ultimately disappoints and bores the reader.<br />The plot, in a nutshell, is vintage Bear: an anthropologist, Mitch Rafaelson, stumbles across three mummies in a cave in the Alps: a Neanderthal man and woman, and a baby, the latter evidently Homo Sapiens. Recovering in a Swiss hospital after an Alpine storm strands his team in the mountains and kills the other two members of the party, Rafaelson learns that researchers and scientists are curious---too curious---about the nature of the 'baby'.<br />In the meantime, a plague is sweeping across the planet, causing pregnant women to miscarry, delivering dead fetuses that are horribly deformed. The rest of Bear's characters---including retrovirus researcher Kaye Lang, CDC investigator Christopher Dicken, his Machiavellian superior Mark Augustine, and a horde of other researchers, scientists, and bureaucrats---race to discover what is behind the virus, and as the book lumbers towards its turgid conclusion, the \\"virus\\", a series of immaculate births, and the mummified infant all come together.<br />By the time they do, the reader really doesn't care. The idea, that human evolution occurs discontinuously and not gradually, is an interesting one, and the science in \\"Darwin's Radio\\" is well developed enough to spur me to research the subject on my own. But the characters, the settings, and the action itself are poorly developed and generic. I would have thought, before reading \\"Darwin's Radio\\", that it would be difficult to make a boring novel about the extinction of the human race; Bear succeeds in doing exactly this.<br />\\"Blood Music\\", Bear's breakthrough novel about nanotechnology gone wrong, succeeded in that it took a scientific concept, pushed it to the worst-case scenario (with little nanites getting out into the world and rewriting the ecosystem), got the story to the point where I thought I knew what was going to happen---and then completely shifted course, catching me off guard and making for a delicious, unnerving, and unpredictable read. With \\"Darwin's Radio\\", the link between the mummy infant and the global virus is pretty clear to the reader by about Page 50, but Bear keeps his characters lumbering along in search of a connection between the two. In the best murder mysteries, the characters are operating on the same level of knowledge as the reader; in the worst, and \\"Darwin's\\" qualifies, the reader is about 250 pages ahead of the characters. This disconnect kills any suspense Bear could have developed, and when the Big Cool Event finally happens---it elicits a yawn.<br />Two stars for the interesting concept and the discussion of real-world retroviruses; spare yourself the trouble and get a copy of \\"Blood Music\\", which is startling and vintage Bear.onclusion, the \\"virus\\", a series of immaculate births, and the mummified infant all come together. <br />By the time they do, the reader really doesn't care.

Buckley, mix with a spoonful of Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, stir in a dollop of David Horowitz, and leaven with a pinch of Hunter S. Thompson; boil, simmer, and stir----and you have Tom Wolfe, acerbic and acid observer of 20th century American society and possibly one of the keenest society writers since Ambrose Bierce. Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers is a slender little tome, with just 152 pages comprising two essays that cut to the quick of race and class relations in American society during the \\"Summer of Love.\\"  These two witty and mesmerizing little essays cut to the heart of the bizarre practice of society's elite espousing radical causes, and effectively capture and explain the seeming paradox of that strangest of modern beasts, the Limousine Liberal.<br />The first essay, \\"Radical Chic\\", is Wolfe's account of the high-society party thrown by New York Symphony conductor Leonard Bernstein and his wife for members of the Black Panthers, at the time a rising group of racialist incendiaries, revolutionaries, and terrorists.  But as Wolfe points out, to the jaded, bored, decadent Central Park elite, they were exciting! Glamorous! Naughty! And highly fashionable, which is why the Thing to Do in New York High Society in 1969 was to throw penthouse parties for radicals.<br />What caused this? And why is it that so many of the affluent and wildly rich of today's American high society sport such radically leftist views, championing causes from banning fur to banning handguns to abolishing capitalism? According to Wolfe, it's a tactic of the newly rich called \\"nostalgie de la boue.\\" Translated as \\"nostalgia for the mud\\", it takes the form of romanticizing the trappings, fashion, style, and even radical philosophies of the underclass in pursuit of irony, social aplomb, and prestige. While Wolfe doesn't mention this, even Marie Antoinette engaged in her own \\"nostalgie de la boue\\", meticulously recreating a 17th century French peasant village on the grounds of Versailles, where she and her ladies-in-waiting would play at being French peasant women.<br />\\"Radical Chic\\" takes the reader on a fascinating trip inside Bernstein's Park Avenue luxury apartment, but the reporter-style writing is actually drier than the more engaging \\"Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers.\\" And best of all, \\"Radical Chic\\" offers a hysterical running dialogue between Lenny Bernstein and Black Panther Don Cox that Hollywood itself couldn't improve upon---with guest appearances by Barbara Walters, the Belafontes, and Otto Preminger!<br />\\"Mau Mau-ing the Flak Catchers\\" is more flamboyant, and, oddly enough, more interesting. \\"Mau-mauing\\" operates as a sort-of handbook for inner-city psychological against the \\"Man\\" (read: white middle-class social services bureaucrats) for fun, prizes, and most of all, money. Interestingly enough, Mau-Mauing (getting some friends and going down to the local social services office for a demonstration) played off white dread of the Racial Other, but Wolfe notes how effectively the largely white bureaucracy of the time used the system to co-opt the Revolutionaries. As Wolfe himself notes, \\"maybe the bureaucracy isn't so stupid at all. All they did is sacrifice one flak-catcher, and they've got hundreds, thousands.\\"<br />Best of all, the second essay shows the early literary seedlings and ideas which would germinate in \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\", including the idea of mau-mauing for fun and profit, wily social services operators who did (and do) understand the fear that white liberals have of appearing racist, the \\"pimp roll\\" and \\"pimp style\\" that infuriated Bonfire's young Assistant D.A., and even the Radical Chic parties that crop up in Bonfire and Wolfe's later novel, A Man in Full.<br />Both essays are fantastic reads, full of perceptive observations that illuminate how the Other Half was living the Summer of Love, and providing some insight into our own upside-down world of American race and class politics.and class politics.	2002-12-25

And Patrick Buchanan doesn't feel fine. The erstwhile presidential candidate, Nixon aide, polemicist, and political commentator is possibly one of the most wilfully misunderstood and maligned political pundits writing in America today, and when I began Death of the West I wasn't certain what to expect.<br />I was therefore pleasantly surprised, and subsequently riveted; Death of the West escapes the typical political clunkiness and idiosyncracies that plague Buchanan's columns, and delivers a stark, depressing, and alarming portrait of the nation in which all of us will grow old. The Death of the West maintains that demographics is destiny: affluent, decadent, morally relativistic Westerners are not having children and not replacing themselves, while the more fecund but impoverished Third World population is exploding. Buchanan projects that if current population trends continue, America and Europe will be third-world countries with alien cultures by 2050.<br />Death of the West is not just a dire Malthusian screed; Buchanan spices up his jeremiad by moving from the West's demographics of death to the skirmishes and routs of the American Culture War. Buchanan's treatment of the development of Cultural Marxism and its influence on American liberal thinkers and revolutionaries in the 1960s is scholarly and full of new insight, and highlights the role that grey little scholars like Gramsci, Marcuse, Adorno, and Lukacs had on creating the world of political correctness and moral relativism in which we live.<br />According to Buchanan, while revolutionary Marxism died throughout the world, cultural marxism was inseminated in the American academy by these scholar-revolutionaries, and from the sixties to the present American leftists conducted a successful \\"long march through the institutions\\", seizing the cultural high ground from which to shape, change, alter, de-christianize and destroy traditional American culture.<br />The Death of the West is a solid, gripping read, although it is depressing and melancholy in only the way that a eulogy to a once vital civilization can be. Conservative or traditionalist readers will find it a revolutionary book, while liberals might be surprised by the intellectual taproots of their philosophy.ad, although it is depressing and melancholy in only the way that a eulogy to a once vital civilization can be.

Whether you're already the Power Elite, the Power Elite in-waiting, the Wannabe Power Elite in-Waiting (Hollywood Assistant Directors, Wall Street undergrad analysts, and Washington DC interns), or just in the mood for a delicious little primer in power politics, Greene & Elffer's fine little tome is a witty, erudite, engaging, and very useful read.<br />There are only a few truly great books about attracting, amassing, building, and expanding one's personal power, and this is one of them; the others would include Machievelli's Prince & the Discourses, Stanley Bing's What would Machiavelli Do?, Musashi's Book of Five Rings, and Sun Tzu's Art of War. As with its notorious predecessors, \\"The 48 Laws of Power\\" takes as its central premise that human relations aren't pretty, that Hobbes was dead right, and that life in the state of civilization is nasty, brutish, and short---that is, unless you manage to carve out a chunk of the spoils for yourself, get the keys to the executive washroom, and install yourself in all the important trips on the Gulf Stream.<br />\\"The 48 Laws of Power\\" is a distillation of millennia of advice to the power hungry, centered about the 48 immutable laws, which are illustrated and studded with fascinating nuggets from the lives of Napoleon, the Caesars, Clausewitz, Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, Otto Von Bismarck, Al Capone, and even conman Yellow Kid Weil.<br />The Laws themselves are great fun and highly useful, some of them obvious and others obscure, and all great for a laugh---while you commit them to memory. The historical illustrations are juicy, well written, and always engaging, but be warned: the book is a little too absorbing. Having bought the book at the World Trade Center's Barnes & Noble, I opened it up on the subway (meaning to go to midtown), and snapped back to reality when I realized I was in the Bronx, leading me to invent a 49th law of power: \\"Don't read the 48 Laws of Power while riding on the 1, 2 or 3 train.\\"<br />Required reading for you and *your* children---but keep the thing away from anyone else, particularly your rivals at the office.ading for you and *your* children---but keep the thing away from anyone else, particularly your rivals at the office.	2001-05-13

Ah well, even the best have to pay rent.<br />Second, there is no finer fictional chronicle of diabolism, either ancient or modern, in English, and none that I know of in most of Earth's other tongues. Each of Blish's characters is deftly crafted with a minimum of prose, a compliment which can extend to the rest of this slight and delicious book; Blish accomplished in a few pages what today's pompous and prolix authors take hundreds of pages to say...Stevie King, though the man can write when he wants to, comes to mind.<br />Finally---and a mild criticism---while it is delightful that Blish takes care to present Malefica as a discipline, it is (or was, for when I first read this I was merely thirteen) somewhat disenchanting to see that Blish gets most of the Satanic formulae, Latin incantations, and demon summoning paraphernalia hopelessly wrong. I have since found older grimoires to draw upon, though, and Black Easter is a work of fiction, so no victim, no foul.<br />All in all a devilishly clever and delightful book; for more nastiness pick up The Day After Judgement, which is actually the third in a trilogy (the first of which was After Such Knowledge).	2001-03-01
