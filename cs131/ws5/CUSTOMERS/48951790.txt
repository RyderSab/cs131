However, he's written the same book four or five times. Getting any one of his books (I'd suggest &quot;The Tropical Aquarium&quot;) means you've read them all.<br /><br /> Also, this book was published in 1986, and is quite out of date. The understanding of the nitrogen cycle in this book is very primative. Get a more recent book.	2004-07-30

Why would I need to read a biography?&quot;<br />A: &quot;Because it's awesome.&quot;<br />Gleick, firstly, goes far deeper into Feynman's life than Feynman did. Feynman didn't consider his books to be autobiographies; they were &quot;Adventures of a curious character.&quot; They were a few hilarious events picked from his long, full life.<br />Gleick's book covers many of the hilarious aspects, but also covers the painful and formative aspects. Also curiously missing from Feynman's books were his science. Feynman wrote about his adventures, Gleick covered the adventures, the disasters, and the science.<br />Brilliant, enthralling reading. Highly recommending to anyone who enjoyed Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Which is, in turn, recommended to anyone who likes funny stories. It reads fast, BTW.)	2004-01-20

The selections and annotations in the Mikhail Tal chapter are especially excellent.<br />Most importantly, Seirawan concludes with a series of tests to allow you to gauge your tactical ability.<br />What makes this book excellent are Seirawan's discussions of the tactics, typically more in-depth than in other tactics books.  His annotated games are also well-chosen and well-annotated.  But especially this book shines at the end, the tests range from simple to fiendishly complex, and I love working through them.	2003-06-11

I've read quite a few Cold-War books, and this is the best of the lot.<br />Friedman gives much more analysis and detail than most of the others go into.  Notably lacking in other texts, but making up the first several chapters of this one, Friedman discusses and dissects the Stalinist society of pre- to post-WW2; this is an important foundation for understanding the Soviets, and the other books (mostly liberal-apoligist) can't bear to admit the evils perpetuated in Stalin's name.<br />As a second example, Friedman also covers quite well the horrible, but often glossed-over, mistakes of the Kennedy-Johnson-McNamara years, especially the fallacies of Johnson's Vietnam policy.<br />This book covers, in both depth and breadth, more than the others, and is not afraid to say what needs to be said.	2003-01-30

This book is a good overview of the cold war, and covers the major events, often drawing on hard-to-find sources.<br />It's also pretty balanced, not conservative, and not terribly liberal.  I almost stopped reading when Walker drew a weak parallel between the resistance to racial integration in the American South to the Soviet massacre of 3,000 innocent Hungarians in 1956, but this was the only abomination before the last chapter of the book, so I continued.  (HOW can a person compare American police using riot-tactics to Soviet tank crews mopping Hungarian-puree off their tank treads?)<br />However, in the final chapter, Walker unfairly criticizes America as having won the Cold War, but having more in common with the USSR than her European allies. For example,  Walker dared to compare the 100-some executions of convicted criminals in America to the millions of innocents and dissidents murdered by Communist repression.<br />So, up to the last chapter, this is an excellent book, but it tapers off dramatically.	2003-01-24

It is sufficiently different in scope that it's hard to believe this is a sequel; it's excellent, but for different reasons.<br />Not only is the science excellent and mind-twisting, the characters and the dilemmas faced them are absolutely wrenching. &quot;Do we destroy these planets, and trillions of lives, or are they innocent?&quot; Once again, Bear's most endearing trait as a writer turns a typical space-opera into a stunning masterwork: he pulls no punches, does not wimp out even once.

Wonderful!<br />BUT, like Lewis's otherwise excellent _Mining the Sky_, he doesn't include any graphs, table or illustrations.

All are good.<br />My personal opinion is that the asteroids -- not the planets -- are the future of mankind, so the Mars-exploration essays by Zubrin et al. I found less enthralling.  But you Mars fans out there NEED this book.<br />The essay, &quot;The Economics of Interstellar Commerce&quot; alone makes this book worth the cost.<br />Although I enjoyed John Lewis's _Mining the Sky_ more (simply because my bent is toward the asteroids), this book is better written and required reading.  4 stars.	2001-09-25

It's a scientifically rigorous discussion of how to utilize the resources available in the solar system for industrial purposes.  By moving our heavy industry beyond the Earth and its atmosphere, we could simultaneously increase the standard of living across the world while ending pollution.<br />I am a material engineer, so I particularly enjoyed how Lewis addressed the engineering issues -- for example, beneficiation of lunar regolith -- in this book.  Most physicists who write books of this type just argue the possibilities, and leave out details of HOW to do things.<br />One complaint:  Lewis doesn't use a single graph, table or illustration.  (A few artist-concept paintings are in the middle.)<br />It's all dense prose, even though 'a picture is worth a thousand words.'  A single schematic of a mill for processing lunar minerals could have replaced pages of text.

Mainly because Card focused on the characters and their dilemmas. The characters' solutions to their problems were all resonable, consistant with the characters' personalities, and well within the laws of physics.<br />In _Xenocide_, Card allows the characters the ask their fairy god-mother (Jane) to solve their problems. She puts them in a magic pumpkin (spaceship) and wisks them around the galaxy, fixing things for them, when the rest of the human race is still confined to slower-than-light ships and limited by the laws of physics.<br />This book should have been labeled 'fantasy,' so I would have known to avoid it and spend the $... on a Robert Forward or Greg Benford.<br />Card is an excellent writer, but this one just wasn't up to his normal snuff. It was a horrible let-down -- I had expected something equal to Ender or Speaker.<br />_Xenocide_ soured me from reading any of the other books in the Ender series, and it is one of the reasons I now prefer to read Sci-Fi by authors who have physics, math or engineering Ph.D.'s.<br />If Card were to take a physcis course and then re-write this book, it would be five stars.	2001-09-07

Without a better understanding of the microstructural effects -- and ensuing DEfects -- it may be too hard to troubleshoot the processes described in this book.<br />My professor was flipping through the early chapters of this book (where the materials issues are presented) and declared them &quot;cheesy.&quot;<br />So, to sum up:  this good book becomes great by combining it with other books/courses/professors/etc that will interject materials issues into this books discussion of the mechanical issues.	2001-04-25
US	48951790	RHQ7H4QZIQTPI	0442304404	229624302	Phase Transformation in Metals and Alloys	Books	5	2	2	N	N	The best there is	This book is the best for undegraduate or early graduate phase transformations courses.<br />Porter and Easterling start by covering the fundamentals:  Basic thermodynamics, Diffusion and crystal interfaces.  These three subjects give you the background to understand the rest of the book.  They then cover solidificaiton reactions, diffusional solid/solid and diffusionless (martensitic) solid/solid reactions.<br />This book, clearly and concisely, conver all the high points of the subject of phase transformations, and lays the foundation for your sudy of the subjects based on PT's: casting, thermomechanical processing, etc.<br />If you are a material scientist, YOU MUST HAVE THIS BOOK.	2001-04-25
US	48951790	R30ECSEAJR4AGS	0070591725	449767581	Structure and Properties of Engineering Alloys	Books	5	1	1	N	N	More useful data than a dozen handbooks	Smith's book is excellent for two reasons:<br />1) His explainations of the properties, structure and applicaiton of various alloys is simple and to the point.  (Many of them are somewhat out of date, but so is every other textbook in the world.)  Excellent for metallurgists.<br />2) This book is so loaded with tables, you may never have to look any mechanical property data up in the library again.  Excellent for mechanical engineers.<br />Although expensive, this book will replace a dozen others on your desk.	2001-04-25

It's full of errors.<br />Of course, the other thermo books out there (DeHoff, Lupis, Swalin) are much worse.  At least Gaskell's explainations make a little sense.<br />Read this book for the concepts; read another when you want accurate equations, graphs and tables.	2001-04-25

Interesting, but not enthralling.<br />Of course, it is NOT POSSIBLE to learn a fighting style from a book; you need an instructor and a gym.  So, read this book for history.  If you want to lean Korean weapons, go to classes, and use this book to supplement your classes.	2001-02-28

In a fit of desperation, I went to the bookstore and looked at all (3) composite books.  This one used the same symbology as my prof's lecture notes, so I bought it, despite the price.<br />What a great investment!  The first chapter gives an excellent overview of the &quot;why?&quot; of composites.  Chapters 2-end give you everything you every needed to know about composite mechanics (at least at the senior undergraduate level.)<br />With this book, I learned the material and passed the course quite easily.<br />Complaint:  Like most textbooks, it gives very little coverage of computer modelling.  Some, but not as much as I would have liked.  It helped me pass the concept parts of the course, but I had to sink-or-swim on my own when it came time to write code.<br />Other than that complaint, this is an excellent introductory book.	2001-02-26
US	48951790	R1FLFALQIZ96S0	0080426859	950831135	Recrystallization and Related Annealing Phenomena	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Covers it all	My professor called this more a &quot;research compendium&quot; than a &quot;text.&quot;  Fair enough -- but it works well enough as a text.<br />The book covers basically all the different aspect of annealing metals:  The cold worked state, recovery, recrystallization, grain growth.<br />The covery of the cold worked state is brief, but good.  It emphasizes how stacking fault energy dominates the dislocation structure, which dominates the other processes, plus other factors (ie, strain TYPE).<br />The covery of recovery is fine, and it handles the static recrystallization of single phase, multiphase and ordered materials, as well as dynamic RX.  Then, it hits grain growth.<br />The nice thing about this book it that it also covers texture effects, both in terms of cold-working and annealing, as well as methods of texture measurement and representation (pole figures, invers PF's, ODF's).<br />Short answer:  this book covers everything.	2001-02-26

When I took SEM at NC State University, it was taught from this book.  Between our professor and this text, I learned the ins and outs of the SEM, and I keep the book within arms reach whenever I'm at work.<br />Goldstein covers everything from the basics of operation, through image formation, sample prep, usage in particular fields of study -- everything!<br />If you get one SEM book, get this one.	2000-10-12

How Dieter accomplished his, I can't imagine.  But he did.<br />He covers everything, from the fundamentals of strees and strain, through dislocation theory, basic deformation and fracture, and the whole scope of metal-forming operations.  If you need it, it's in this book.<br />Two complaints:<br />1) There is relatively little coverage of computer modeling, FEM, etc.  These are the future of engineering, and Dieter needs to get on the boat when (if) he writes a fourth edition.<br />2) The index is USELESS.<br />These two faults don't change the fact that this is one of he most important single books ever written in the field of material science.	2000-10-12

I won' repeat the similar comments made by the other reviewers.<br />My only complaint: it doesn't go into much detail.  I realize that Dr. Gillett had to write a book anyone could use for their sci-fi, be they engineer or English major.  He couldn't go math-crazy.<br />Well, as an engineer, I would have liked to see a chapter or two, added at the end, intended for people who aren't scared of differential equations and who want to BUILD a world, not just outline it.<br />My experience, in both industry and graduate school, is that the obscure implications you encounter while modeling a system can be as interesting and important as the final answer you achieve.  Dr. Gillett just gives us the final answer.<br />So, to sum up:  EXCELLENT book and REQUIRED reading.  But, they should have thrown in another chapter of MATH.	2000-09-29
