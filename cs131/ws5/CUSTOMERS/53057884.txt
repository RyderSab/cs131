It's all the rage these days to \\"expose\\" moral & religious agendas, but Christian fundamentalists, New-Age spiritualists, radical feminists, cultural relativists, and anti-religionists might broaden their outlook by exposure to The Secret Garden. <br /> <br />But I cannot fault the storytelling or illustrations of this classic. It is mildly puzzling in that the storyline starts out with a journey of self-discovery and personal improvement for the orphan girl Mary, but gradually pushes her to the side as Master Colin undergoes his own salvation. So it's hard to say whether this is a \\"girl's book\\" or a \\"boy's book\\" -- it's not both at once except briefly at the crossover from emphasis from Mary to Colin. <br /> <br />Cultural nonjudgementalists will be irritated at the portrayal of  Yorkshire life, speech and peasantry. But I think it's important for young readers to understand not only aspects of the historical Yorkshire culture itself, but also how it was sentimentalized by the English class structure. <br /> <br />Mostly harmless -- good for storytime and middle readers.	2005-03-30

Slow-paced, stereotyped female characters, a purely-evil antagonist with no reason to exist, unevolving personalities, irrelevant plot digressions, endless nasty and pointless dialog. <br /> <br />Frau Funke's German-to-English translator evidently missed the distinction between Elves and Fairies - quite clear in the British tradition, but lost here because the German \\"Elfen\\" can refer to either. She simply takes whatever magical creature she's heard of and assigns to them whatever attributes strikes her fancy. <br /> <br />A good editor would have cut this huge volume down by 30-50%. During storytime I cut out the dross just to hasten making an end. Dreary and tiresome by the end.	2005-03-12

Gone however is any real novelty or discovery. <br /> <br />This time around it gets a little creepy by modern, postfeminist standards. The girls delight in nonstrenuous domesticity, whereas the boys do the heavy lifting and shop work. Henry assumes the role of Father Knows Best autocrat for the little family, the rich grandfather being mostly absent again. <br /> <br />Not too surprising, given that Warner's generation also made the infamous mental hygiene classroom films and social engineering initiatives of the post-WWII era. <br /> <br />If traditional, rigidly-defined, sex-linked roles taught by example are okay with readers' parents, go for it. Progressives and modern liberals will surely be appalled. The enigmatic character of Joe could never be written into modern stories. <br /> <br />The artwork in this edition of Surprise Island is wretched, nothing at all like the first book's.	2005-03-01

But really the only critics who see therein crypto-fascism, totalitarianism, bla bla bla are the Leftist, liberal-progressive, \\"Ain't a-gonna study war no more\\" types. Like Verhoeven and the Hollywierd producers that corrupted Heinlein's message in the movie adaptation.<br /><br />Heinlein describes exactly what the welfare-state One-Worlders have been trying so hard to do to the West for the past three generations. He no doubt was laughing grimly in the grave after 9/11, muttering \\"I told you so.\\" That any illegal alien can sneak into the USA and get a drivers' license or vote is another example of the craziness which he campaigned against.<br /><br />One of Heinlein's core messages is that citizenship and its attendant rights should belong to those who defend one's civilization, indeed one's very species. Cowards and pacifists need not apply -- they can just go pick up their dole check. But vote? Forget it.<br /><br />If you read no other Heinlein (betcha can't read just one!), make sure it's this one.	2005-01-31

The story is mostly captivating and, barring a few slow patches, moves along and has some classic elements of mystery, restless adventure, adaptation to change, and enough suspense to keep the pages turning.    However -- there are a few feminist rocks thrown in the soup. The only adventurers and leaders of whom the protagonist is (made) aware are solely women. This is strange, for Annabelle Doll works her way into adventure just fine without needing American Heroines for inspiration. Also, parental figures, men, and brothers are either ultimately irrelevant or feckless. Non-doll characters are all girls or women -- except for the major source of trouble, namely a male cat.    But for all that, it's a good book for seven-year old girls at least.	2005-01-17

The Princess Cimorene seems to have a bad case of brain cloud, running away from repressive parents only to enter drudge service to a dragon -- but it's a she-dragon, so that's all right then.    The main character is snotty, mumbles passive-aggressively, and demonstrates that acting stupid and vain is the only way to deal with unscrupulous wizards. Not what I would call fine role-modeling for girls of any age.    Male characters (human and otherwise) are without exception either clueless morons or cruel and devious, up to no good. The narrative is overly-descriptive, full of needless, distracting detail. Action is often sluggish to nonexistent -- pages of boring conversation. Attempts at humor by alluding to classic fairy tales fall flat. Identification or empathy with characters at zero.    Suffers from a common writer's pitfall: It Fails To Entertain. During evening storytime, we skimmed and abridged the last half of the book, just to make an end ASAP.    Other reviewers and commentators have claimed that since males get better treatment in the author's  related books, I should cut some slack on Dragons. Really, you couldn't pay me enough for the time lost in tediously plowing through those works. And judging by the low quantity of reviews of follow-on books, I'd guess that other readers tacitly agree.	2005-01-17

Zaphod Beeblebrox and Slartibartfast are easy to pronounce by comparison.  * Harry Potter: Chapter heading illustrations that look like clip art or sterile CAD drawings. Boring & meaningless.  * Beatrix Potter: cute little animals walking on their hind legs, pretending to be human. Arrggh.    Other points:    * Seventy-five chapters, evidently written in seventy-five days.  * Paragraph-long descriptive lists of items - tiresome.  * Lovingly detailed descriptions of pointless action and conversation.  * Cardboard, stereotyped characters: timid hero, dashing adventuress, nasty & tempestuous harpy neighbor etc. No depth, and I couldn't work up sympathy for any of the characters.    I read nightly to my 5-year old daughter, and with this book I had to constantly edit out highly objectionable speech and long boring passages that add nothing to the plot or action. If I have to perform real-time intensive surgery just to read a book, then what's the point? Too much work for me, and too little enjoyment all around.    You'd be better in finding some other books.

The author is so caught up with grinding the axe of how awful religious tyranny is, how communist-fascist states destroy real culture, and how wonderful homosexual unions are, that she fails to tell a decent story or even adhere to classic dramatic forms that are classic for good reason.<br />Bo-ring! There is nothing fun about this travelogue through pseudo-Tibetan or -Nepalese culture, about being dragged through miserable upbringings and traumatic upheavals, or having to learn yet another stupid set of pseudo-linguistic honorifics and sound-concepts. I finished this story feeling let down, anti-entertained, and irritated at the waste of time spent waiting for it to get good.<br />The Right Wing would accuse Ms. Le Guin of lesbo-feminist leanings, which would be unfair except for the evidence of the story itself: an idyllic persecuted pastoral-peasant utopian culture wherein a significant portion of the population are gay or lesbian. Gimme a break! There has never been any evidence that such a Terran-human cultural has ever existed for thousands of years, so it's not as if she is writing from example.<br />Give this one a pass.

It details the morally barren and intellectually dishonest bases of the mid-20th Century round of feminism only just now petering out.<br />The author now & then shares her personal taste in, er, conjugal relations, and occasionally employs vivid imagery to make a point. Most amateur reviewers cannot overcome their reactions and revulsions enough to stay with the narrative. For myself, I enjoyed the break from the rather turgid, stuffy writing style loaded with two-dollar words. My Oxford abridged dictionary doesn't even list \\"fungible\\"!<br />But the thesis is strong: modern feminism was a big factor in creating the child-hating, sexually perverse culture we live in today. Not surprising, really, since biographies and self-admissions reveal that today's feminism was founded by disgruntled corner cases with just those characteristics.<br />As a result, women actually have a harder time relating to other women, men and children, and have fewer choices today than they did in the mid-1950's, in that the woman choosing to be the core of her family is reviled and pressured to abandon her children and neglect her marriage.<br />Women who prefer to serve strangers in the marketplace are actually subsidized at the cost of traditional families, through \\"childcare\\" credits, anti-competitive affirmative action programs, corporate workplace inefficiencies etc. And as Mrs. Graglia notes but IMO does not sufficiently develop, modern (non-)mothering by working women requires the existence of a huge economic underclass of proxy-mothers, who are paid as little a possible for doing the untimately thankless job of making sure little Jill and Johnny don't kill themselves or feel totally abandoned.<br />Anyway, Domestic Tranquility is a valuable read for those wishing a balanced viewpoint. I enjoyed having my brain deprogrammed a bit, and now think I see the world better without the feminist distortions of the dominant culture.	2002-09-21

None of the mature female characters are good role models: Miss Honey is wimpy, The Trunchbull is cruel, The Mother is indifferent (the Father and Brother, bullies); what's here for a girl to look forward to in adulthood? Nothing good, I daresay.    Dahl's rather bizarre idea of girl empowerment encompasses petty revenge and telekinesis; hardly what ordinary girls in the real world can depend on for life skills.

R. Klenner, MD. Yet it is mostly guesswork and hearsay, stitched together with newspaper-clipping quality journalism and detective-novel gore and intrigue.    Bledsoe makes vicious attacks against the unorthodox but highly successful treatment protocols of the elder Klenner, emphasizing his few failures to help patients. He discredits, ignores or deprecates his many successes, portraying Dr. Klenner as some quack dispensing useless if not harmful treatments.    There is no compassion here for the ill-fated son, who evidently descended into paranoid schizophrenia; little for the heartbreak of the father who saw his hopes and pride shattered. Other reviewers who dismiss the young Fritz as \\"crazy\\", \\"evil\\" or, charitably, \\"unbalanced\\" (and the odd Amazon reviewer calling him and his father Nazis), fail to understand the extent of his mental illness. Nor does Bledsoe even scrape the surface of trying to fathom it or draw parallels to other psychiatric cases.    Interested readers should find out more about Dr. Klenner's fascinating life work, and skip the lurid sensationalism and scandal-mongering pandered by this \\"journalist\\". Read instead the books by Abram Hoffer, Carl C. Pfeiffer, Allan Cott, Linus Pauling, Irwin Stone and others to find out what Dr. Frederick W. Klenner was really up to, and how he was doing it decades before others followed his example.    As for \\"Bitter Blood\\", it's an unpleasant waste of time and ink. Better detective reading can be found almost anywhere, especially where it doesn't intentionally mis- and under-represent facts to pump up the lurid themes.	2002-04-19

But there's nothing in the book of redeeming value for girls to identify with, unless one counts long-winded railing against spoilt kids with very bad habits?<br />The underlying message of this book is that girls have no part in larger adventures and rewards, that men and boys and male Oompa Loompas run the show.

They supposedly feature sugar-coated glossings-over of shameful facts of \\"genocide\\", environmental pillage, state-sanctioned violence and war crimes, political offenses and deep-seated ethnic hatred and racism over the 500-year history of the European presence in the New World.    Loewen maintains that the basic functions of history textbooks were to instill reverence for the State -- patriotism if you will -- by creating heroes of ordinary and often less-than-perfect historical figures, notably by sweeping inconvenient facts under the rug (you mean radical socialist Helen Keller wasn't just a nice blind lady?). The American Right would reply that modern texts aim to dismantle the State and foster obedience to and dependence on it.    But I guess her conclusion that public school texts are aimed at creating history-ignorant, uncritical, flag-waving, jingoist consumers by the public school system is just opinion. Loewen clearly writes from a modern revisionist-leftist standpoint; yet since the completion of the Anschluss of US education by the Left, the thesis of \\"Lies\\" is mostly obsolete.    It's not a terrible read, but to balance out Loewen's message, you might also crack Medved's \\"[[ASIN:0307394077 The 10 Big Lies About America: Combating Destructive Distortions About Our Nation]]\\" to examine and debunk the PC myths that the American Left have themselves created.	2001-10-14

Mr. Gatto's authoritative rant will serve to further destabilize the already shaky public education system -- no loss, as it should be obvious to any but the most simple-minded. As one of two dedicated parents of an almost-four-year-old, we had been disgusted with the \\"choices\\" the state deigns to present to us in education: bad and worse. These are, of course, not choices at all.    Mr. Gatto explains briefly how far education and learning have fallen in the US, and how the \\"education\\" system serves only to propagate and serve itself, not the children who are its nominal clients.    If you doubt that the US state school system is de facto totalitarian, just try to homeschool without jumping through hoops, pleading for exemptions, and submitting to standardized testing. See how long you go until you get \\"the knock\\".    Any current or soon-to-be school-age parent must read this book to assist them in their decision to send their kid to or keep their kid in the 12-year prison of progressive factory schooling.     Those who are the product of the system, as I am, will read, grieve, get angry and get primed to take action.

If one does, the &quot;reality&quot; obtained is in fact just opinion based on personal esthetics, bias, prejudice, or sociopolitical agenda. Gould demonstrates this time and again in reviewing a century of racist and classist-tainted research. IQ will forever lie outside true science because numbers boiled down from test scores will never be convincingly tied to any tangible, objective, repeatable reality.<br />Correlation matrices, factorial analyses and bell curves are beside the point, Gould maintains, since the basic concept of IQ is fundamentally and irredeemably flawed. IQ's practical use is always to establish or reaffirm hierarchies, to winnow and discriminate. Binet's original goal for the IQ was to merely identify clearly subnormal school children so they could be helped. Once it was out of his hands, however, other, less lofty uses were found for the metric.<br />Gould shows convincingly that IQ testing was seized upon as a eugenics-based rationale to restrict US immigration from Eastern Europe beginning in the 1930's. Up to 6 million people, including many Jews and other undesirables, may have been denied entry into the US as a result. Go figure.<br />This reified acceptance of IQ's validity is alive and well today. Books like The Bell Curve and other hereditarian racist-by-definition works sell like hotcakes, yet are merely rehashings of the same old stuff. Many private schools use IQ testing to exclude undesirables (as if their five-figure tuitions weren't exclusionary enough!). Reading Gould's book will open one's eyes to the nasty, flawed basis and uses of all IQ testing, past, present and future.	2001-08-08

In four months I shed that pound-a-year flab that  had accumulated since leaving college, I have more sustained energy, and am  free from lifelong grain-and milk-caused allergies.<br />I recommend  Neanderthin most wholeheartedly! We are raising our two-year-old daughter  the Neanderthin way.	2000-01-23

Here's a quick formulaic approach to detach from one's children and turn them into mistrustful, pliant, hostile little drones. Basically a hateful religious/demagogic rehashing of the old \\"children should be seen, not heard\\" outlook with generous dollops (or should I say \\"wallops\\"?) of \\"spare  the rod, spoil the child\\" and \\"might makes right\\". Obviously written by  somebody with zero experience outside his own narrow, pseudo-theological  ken, it goes against every lesson accrued via observation, research and  trial-and-error over most of the 1900s.  Parents &amp; guardians using this  compendium of abuse deserve what they get - sadly, society will have to  deal with the results.	1999-07-12

A clear, well-stated argument is made for elimination  of modern foods that need to be cooked or processed to be edible, or which  couldn't be obtained by a hunter-gatherer on the savanna, 'naked with only  a sharp stick.' Well done, and totally workable recommendations without  demanding too much in the way of dietary sacrifice or lifestyle change. It  works!	1999-04-28

Infants near death were revived by vitamin C injections, and the 50% death  rate (hence the title) in the region dropped to near zero during his 8-year  practice.  Deaths rose to former levels after he was drummed out by the  Australian health authorities.<br />Dr. K found his clinical observations and  conclusions ridiculed &amp; ignored by the authorities, and still suffers  hostility, persecution and shunning by the medical establishment.<br />His  work is deservedly praised by other medical heretics including Pauling,  Klenner, Cathcart and others who challenge the myths that shots are  health-giving and that vitamin C is good only for preventing scurvy.<br />A  great book by a great doctor, it should be read by every caring current or  future parent. Pediatricians and MDs in general too.	1999-04-04

Then it goes on to promote a particular commercial vitamin C product.    Looks like a vanity press production. Not recommended for  those needing unconventional or thorough coverage. There are many, many other books offering more comprehensive treatment of the uses of vitamin C.	1998-09-24
