Very handy.  Thank you, Richard Barber!    ...  And more:  I have been a Grail hobbyist since the late 1970s, and I skipped reading Da Vinci Code because I had already read Baigent & Leigh and the subject had grown so *yawn* passe.  I've read shelves of Grail literature, and tossed aside countless books on the subject that turned out to be, well, ridiculous, or ravings, or poorly written either in terms of sloppy thinking or overmuch obfuscating.  Not that there aren't good books on the subject, just that the ratio of good to unhelpful is depressingly poor.  Barber's book is beyond helpful, it is straightforward, encyclopedic, and non-derogatory (and I totally didn't catch anything \\"cutesy\\", despite what another reviewer is grumping about).      It is of course helpful to have read a few Grail stories first!  I would recommend Malory's Morte D'Arthur (there is a lovely new edition out by Barnes & Noble if you want to treat yourself) and a nice version of Chretien de Troyes, but probably any would do, although I'd recommend a minimum of two, and from at least two separate languages or centuries (and Disney doesn't count).  It is also helpful to have a basic knowledge of the Christian Eucharist (Mass, Communion), wherein the Body and Blood of Christ are present in the Bread and Wine.  Less common but (I think) also interesting treatments also include the poetic cycles Taliessin Through Logres and The Region of the Summer Stars, by Charles Williams (AKA his Arthuriad) as well as the novels of Stephen R. Lawhead.  Grail works are typically eccentric, so one must find the works that best suit one.    One of the many very useful things that Barber pointed out, for me, was the interweaving of the various forms of Christ's Blood (blood from his body vs. \\"blood\\" of Communion wine), and which he does, in my opinion, objectively, leaving the reader to decide what he or she may or may not believe.  Barber just traces what was written by whom and when... along with just enough about settings and such, not too much, but with a novella's worth of bibliography, one can read on as one desires.      When it comes to the later works, however, Barber really hits his stride in terms of critical commentary.  He agrees or disagrees with various scholars and movements, and provides names and dates so that you may, again, follow up as you like.  He seems to have been particularly moved by Wagner's Parsifal.  As Barber moves into the modern works, his tone becomes more critical.  At first I found this a little disturbing, as I had enjoyed his neutral stance regarding the early scholarship, but then I thought that it was only right, because now he is evaluating and judging writers who are his peers, whose context in culture is known to him -- those of whom, it may be said, he has \\"walked a mile in their moccasins.\\"  While I very much enjoyed the Baigent & Leigh book (Holy Blood, Holy Grail), it is in a way the modern incarnation of Erich von Daniken's _Chariots of the Gods_, which I had enjoyed as a child, and I am more than comfortable with Barber's critical dismissal of it.  Also, and perhaps this is a significant point, I am in agreement with Barber's summation of the tradition as an intergrowth of \\"imagination and belief,\\" and in fact I think I have been of that mind for some years and just unable to distill it as he has.    I've been to a number of Grail-related locations, such as the Chalice Well in Glastonbury, and that little church, I forget where, with the lamprey carved in the wall over the piscina.  Garway, maybe?    This book introduces a few more places for my list of future Grail sites to visit.  All in all, an unprecedented work, and a much welcome sanity break in a typically subjective genre.    My review hardly does justice to this amazing work.  If you or someone you know is a Grail hobbyist, please at least have a look at this book.   For my part, I cannot wait to read his works on Chivalry and King Arthur, and if I am very lucky, I may someday have a chance to attend a convention and see his mind at work live at the podium.  (I feel this way also about Tom Shippey, as regards Tolkien and language scholarship.)	2005-10-12

The subject matter is covered in a way that makes you feel the author/illustrator is excited about the topic and wants you to be also.   <br /> <br />Coelacanths and other ancient things are getting trendy lately, so don't you think this book should be brought back to print? <br /> <br />My copy is a hardcover ex-library copy.  I don't know if it was available in paperback.  I almost think that at the time it may not have been a popular enough topic for the mass market.	2005-08-20

I was looking for The Ballad of Beta-2 and Empire Star, a two-in-one Delany title that does not seem to be on amazon.  I agree with the other reviewer:  Ballad of Beta-2 is a quick and interesting mystery, highly recommended.  The other tale that it is bound with, in my copy, Empire Star, is more complex (and not as haunting), but still a rewarding bit of short Delany SF.  Delany can be very bizarre (as in Dhalgren) but he can also write good old-fashioned SF.  !	2005-06-12

Mr. Epstein wrote a terrific biography of Edna St. Vincent Millay, entitled _What Lips My Lips Have Kissed_, and several volumes of poetry.  I got this book from the library thinking it was a book of poetry but it's not -- it's a sort of autobiography and thoughts on human nature and love and other nifty things. It is not really an autobiography or a memoir, however, for he was born in the early 1950s and at the time of writing this book he was forty years old, which he felt (and I agree) was too young to write a memoir.  Like many others who write about the human condition, however, he chooses to illustrate his observations and theories with anecdotes from his own life.  In this case, he starts with the analysis of a child's love for its parents, and moves on through life, observing, describing, and analyzing.  Of course it's subjective, and one's experiences may differ from his, but that very personal-ness makes it all the more real, and all the more ready to be integrated into one's own paradigm, with alterations as needed.    The chapter titles are as follows (with my comments in parentheses):    Preface (do not skip)  One:  Filial Love  Two:  Sibling Love and Childhood Friendship  Three:  Erotic Love  Four:  Conjugal Love and Adult Friendship  Five:  Parental Love  Six:  Spiritual Love    In my subjective hierarchy of such things, this man is cut from similar cloth as singer/songwriters Ramblin' Jack Elliot and Bob Dylan, as well as the late \\"Pope of Soap\\" Dr. Bronner, and other recent eccentric geniuses.  Mr. Epstein is at once larger than life and extraordinarily empathetic; the latter is often a quality of a fine poet, but the former not always.  We are fortunate to have him writing in our time, and I look forward to his future works.	2005-06-07

It does have some terrific points and points of view about handling the mutations and regional dialects, and as the other reviewer said it is not for the beginners.  It covers a lot of points and details in what really is not a large volume, but they are points and details that I think should have been titled something other than \\"Basic Welsh.\\"  \\"Details of Modern Welsh\\" might be a better description.  This might be a good candidate for an audiobook instead of text, for some of us.  I am both a beginner and not really... I have been poking at the language off and on for twenty years or so.  The best books I have found for beginners are actually booklets put out by Teledu BBC Cymru called Dechrau Siarad Starting to Speak Welsh. I also have enjoyed a booklet called Speak Welsh, by Gwen Pritchard Jones.  Unfortunately these little booklets can be hard to come by.  A nice fat dictionary is also invaluable.	2005-05-16

The other volumes are:  2.  Metals; 3. Wood and paper; 4. Ceramics; 5. Glass; 6. Dyes, paints and adhesives; 7. Fibers; 8. Water; and 9. Air. <br /> <br />For myself I am a college-educated reasonably bright adult who is not strong in the materials science area, and I was looking in the youth section of the library for books on plastic, because I wanted to learn about plastics, specifically modern resins, but since I am largely ignorant I wanted some good general introductions.  \\"Grown-up\\" books tend to be a bit difficult for the beginner, and books written for young people are often clearly written, with pages that are not over-crowded with information, and useful bibliographies.  If you don't agree with this logic then you probably won't find any of my reviews useful, however if it makes sense to you then read on. <br /> <br />This book is not perfect.  My main quibble is in the area of toxicity, for example.  I am only about halfway through the book, but I am already being struck by such things as PVC being described as non-toxic.  Currently, there is a good bit of controversy over the toxicity of PVC, for example of the phthalates used as plasticizers.  Likely these books, written for young people, need to stay focused on their subjects, but I think it would be useful to have a sidebar about toxicity in future editions. <br /> <br />There is a staggering amount of information in this volume, and it is kind of overwhelming.  It does rather reinforce the point of there being many different kinds of plastics.  The glossary and index pertain to the entire set, which is unfortunate, and there is no bibliography or other listing of sources.  In fact, one could rather question some of the statements in this book.  Where was the information obtained?  Is this industry propaganda?  Plastics are petroleum derivatives, and there are some environmental concerns here.  On the other hand, researching the truth or bias of various subjects could be a good exercise for developing a [young or older] person's critical faculties.	2005-03-21

Books	4	0	0	N	N	Kids like; Mom thinks it's a bit Odd	We have an ex-library hardback edition, story and pictures by Lilo Fromm, translated by Sophie Wilkins, published by Doubleday & Company (Garden City NY) 1967? (only date is for illustration copyright).  My children enjoy this book; the 7-year-old boy especially likes having it read to him.  I find some of the pictures a bit off-putting; I think Pete the Drifter and the Noise Man are kind of scary, but they are not terribly realistic pictures.  Pumpernick and Pimpernell look more like a cross between Raggedy Andy and a scarecrow, I think. The book I think probably rings of European children's tales of a certain time (much as sitcoms do the same) and I am just not familiar with them.  OK, the story... <br /> <br />The story is about Pumpernick and Pimpernell, two little fellows who live in a small house in an overgrown garden, and their dog, Pudding the Brave.  They live a nice picturesque country life until one day a huge blue mouse is found napping on their roof.  They are rather worried about this. (Pudding, by the way, is a small white dog who is not exactly brave either.)  Then the creepy-looking Pete the Drifter (and his rooster) comes tromping in, and our main characters prudently climb a nice tall tree and get out of the way.  Then the rowdy Noise Man and his cart appear on the scene.  Pete and the Noise Man, each wanting what the other has, get into a fight, which wakes up the mouse, who is cranky and gets in the fight also.  The three tussle all about until they knock themselves out.  Pumpernick, Pimpernell and Pudding then load them into the Noise Man's cart and trundle them down to the river, where they handily find a boat and set them adrift.  They keep the Noise Man's cart and bell, and Pete's rooster also joins them, and one presumes they live happily ever after.  Oh, and they also take the precaution of making a sign \\"Keep Out!  Biting Dog!\\" <br /> <br />I gave it four stars because although I found the pictures a bit off-putting, my kids enjoy the book and the main characters do after all solve their woes through cleverness, leaving the violence to the bad guys.	2005-03-14

Having spent the past month or so reading this book to my children at bedtime, we felt very disappointed when we reached the end and it was basically a \\"To Be Continued\\" affair.  This book started out looking like a fun situation -- there were dolls and a music CD marketed with it, but it looks like the dolls are being put on clearance, I haven't heard the CD, and who knows whether there will ever be another book.  I think it is very wrong for a children's book to go on and on and build up and build up towards, in this case, saving the kingdom by bringing back the dragons, and all we ever meet is a precocious, not very dragonish, baby dragon freshly hatched.  The drawings are nice, the book reads OK, but it is very flawed.  A child (or even a parent reader) cannot be expected to remember, for example, the details of the story of Prince Gorgon when it is only told once and then the character turns up towards the end of the story.  My older son gave it two and 3/4 stars, and the younger one only followed it a chapter at a time so he couldn't really rate it.  I think the authors could have done much better, and should have packaged this tale, if it really needed to be in two volumes, as the two volumes together so the children actually get to read about the culmination of the quest.  Good potential, poor execution.	2005-01-31

I have finished reading this book since I first left the review, and I would give it four stars if the system let me, even though I was hesitant to do that, as there is a lot to overcome in terms of polish.  The connections and little jokes are so many that I could overlook the sloppiness -- but it took getting halfway through the book to do that.  The publisher would do well to invest in a proofreader (the \\"lentil\\" for \\"lintel\\" errors especially vexed me) and a little editing, although the extraneous adjectives did contribute to the over-the-top Victorian swashbuckler atmosphere.  Still, it made me wonder whether the publisher was a \\"real\\" one or a \\"vanity press.\\"  This book is bit of light reading that's enjoyable enough in its own regard -- just be sure you've read the prereqs:  Chthulhu and Holmes and the other silly Victorian era tales.	2004-11-24

Oh, ow, these books aren't nearly as well done as the American Girl books.  That said, maybe what to me seems cheesy and shallow is fun and appealing for those of today's girls who are not interested in the lively, well researched, well illustrated historical books that go with the American Girl dolls.  There is also a Dear America series, which is a bit harsher.  If one thinks that the American Girl books are too \\"sweet,\\" perhaps try them.

I have the edition with the burgundy leatherette cover, Imprimatur John Cardinal Heenan, Westminster, July 4, 1966; and Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 66-24278.  It has lots and lots of footnotes.    For myself, nothing can live up to the music of the Revised Standard Version of the Bible, but sometimes it is good to read things in unfamiliar words, because when we hear what we know, we don't always hear.  Also, I had wanted to get a Jerusalem Bible because of the scholarship behind it, the translations done afresh.  Some people are put off by the use of \\"Yahweh\\" for the Name of GOD, but truly we do not know what the \\"real\\" name is, and \\"Jehovah\\" has been used by so many writers that that figure is pretty well established as a cranky old man with a beard.  Of course I also like that this Bible includes the Apocrypha.  The language is modern and easy to read, and the way the text runs all the way across the page is easy on the eyes as well.  It does take a little getting used to, but it is a wonderful Bible to have and to give.  Footnotes, chronological table, index and maps are additional bonuses.  Highly recommended!	2004-11-10

It covers, with lots of photos, the lives of many famous and lesser-known people.

There is also an interesting introduction, covering the language and background of the field of \\"special people\\" (\\"Odd Man Out,\\" \\"The Comprachicos,\\" \\"Motives for Wonder,\\" \\"Ugly Words,\\" etc.).

On the one hand, it is full of half-familiar, half-remembered names from Celtic and Gaelic lore, old themes of selkies (\\"selchies\\"), speaking crows (think of the Northern Ravens), islands in the seas and other witcheries.  For me the cadence took some getting used to, although 20-odd years ago when I read more of the older fantasies and original materials it would not have seemed so odd.  The wounded hero, Finn, is not weak, but a mixture of ignorant and arrogant, the way youth and beauty can and should be.  I think it is a very good book, but it is not fast and easy going, and it is not just the same old same old rehash of Americanized pop pseudo-Celtic themes.  I am looking forward to reading Undersea and Winterking also.  If you liked this melange of familiar yet not quite the same, you might like Tad Williams' To Green Angel Tower.	2004-10-26

There are some funny lines in the dialogue, and the illustrations are very engaging.  A very good book for the read-aloud set.	2004-07-17

It opens with mere mortals, then introduces the Count, with such perfect physical descriptions that you are truly transported to the flesh of the woman who meets him.  The mysteries and sadness that seem to pervade this series are of course present; there is sadness in the ending that one might have liked to see otherwise, but it was still excellent.  Plot and descriptions are both strong throughout, not always a trait of historicals or romance.   And as a bonus, the reader learns about ergotism (called &quot;blighted grain,&quot; I believe, in the book).  Fascinating!	2004-06-26

This one, with its &quot;Commandments&quot; and its friendly text, it could perhaps be compared to the Artist's Way books, but this substantial book is full of pictures and little eating tips (not fancy intimidating recipes, but useful ones, and general advice).  I relied heavily on this book and her Sensuality of Strength when I first got into weight training over 20 years ago, and I still enjoy the sport, although I don't have as much time for it any more.  I think her work makes fitness more enjoyable, and enjoying fitness is the key to keeping it up.  Her books introduce you to something that becomes part of your life -- not just a fad.	2004-06-20

Twenty-odd years ago, when I started weight training, there just wasn't much out there for women who wanted to be strong,  natural and happy.  Gayle Olinekova's books were a special find then, and remain treasures today.  The text is upbeat and the pictures are far from generic.  With the help of her books, weight training, positive health attitude and healthy eating habits are a joy.	2004-06-20

The younger readers can enjoy the story and pictures on a basic level, and adults and progressing readers can enjoy the humor.  Another simple and perfect out-of-print kids' title that beats the silly over-contrived modern ones with one hand behind its back.	2004-06-18

The names and the places were hard to keep track of, although they were perfectly workable as feeling real and not fake.  It was hard to tell which were the important ones to remember and which the ones just peppered in for the story.  What killed the book for me was the amount of gore and the savagery, and the killing off of the most sympa characters, however, Lynn's skill with characterization and description is still there.  I read her trilogy of northern something books some years ago and they were strange and different and good.  This is not like them.  I think this book would appeal to those who like their fantasy on the strong and unsweet side.<br />Some might compare Lynn's bitter fantasy element with that of Sheri S. Tepper, but I would not.  Those who like Tepper may or may not like this book.  I think Tepper's work is more ultimately transcendental and heartening.  Lynn does such a good job of creating unique and real characters though.	2004-05-07

The material is well presented, with plenty of white space, line drawings, and historical photographs.  It is interesting and easy to read.  I picked up one copy for my household, and another for our older son's second grade teacher.	2004-03-28

Each page has just a sentence or three, and a nice picture, and a lovely humour suitable for children of any age.  Neither children nor adults need brainless mush stories, we need stories like this, that may or may not be magic, but anyway show that we can be responsible for our own lives and happiness (although sometimes a little magic comes along as well).	2003-11-25

While _The Dawn of Human Culture_ does cover many aspects of human evolution clearly and well, explaining theories and pitfalls, and including a lot of clear sketches, most of the book is just that, a rehash of evolutionary theory.  The authors don't get to the subject at hand until very late in the book (in fact, I haven't finished reading yet, and only the knowledge that they do eventually make some sort of a point is keeping me reading it).    I think I would have enjoyed the book more if I had been better prepared going in, because I kept expecting to read something really new and interesting.	2003-07-04

I had saved clippings and ads about it and looked forward to reading it, even lucked upon a signed copy.  But this modern style is not for me.  Both the premise and the setting (Christ and Mary Magdalene's love story in a Celtic world) were great, but I didn't like the execution.  The author often intrudes with a narrator's voice, which works in many novels but would probably have worked better here if she had chosen one style and stuck to it.  There are probably a lot of modern writers and readers who enjoy this  mixture of archetypal subject and words like \\"piss\\", but I'm not one of them.  Too many cuss words and not enough mythic flavor.  If you are still hungry for that special work, I would suggest Evangeline Walton's retelling of the Mabinogion, perhaps.  Or anything by McKillip or MacAvoy.  I do still want to try reading some of Ms Cunningham's other titles, however.  She's obviously got spirit.	2003-01-02

Now we just need for them to write another volume, it's been a while since this was written, and the Zuni fetish world is always evolving.	2001-12-27
