This book was written before 1973 (prior to NLP), probably around 1970 and seems to be John's dissertation.  It's a highly technical book discussing some details of the theory of transformational grammar.  As John Grinder acknowledges himself in the preface, this is an \\"academic book\\" and is written in a very dense style of writing that John dismisses himself by the time the book got published. He even adds: \\"There is little in the content of the particular generalizations which I made in this study that I would now argue for.\\"  A bit further in his preface he even states that transformational linguistics is near to its demise. <br />    <br />In other words, the book is of little use (as best) for someone interested in NLP and is probably not even useful for those specialized in linguistics. <br /> <br />Patrick E.C.

The authors explain how many people tend to make themselves unhappy, by having the wrong expectations from life and by looking for happiness in the wrong places.<BR>Reading this book should help you change your minds and figure out why you must stop running those unhappiness patterns.  The book is illustrated with numerous examples of how Dan baker helped his patients achieve this and at the end of the book you get an \\"action plan\\", which is unfortunately only an overview table of the \\"do's and don'ts of happiness\\".<BR>I've hesitated to give this book only 4 stars, because for me it doesn't fully live up to its promise of being a self-help book.  It calls for a sequel, which should explain better how to use techniques such as \\"personal appreciation\\", making perceptual shifts, managing your own emotions, using constructive questioning, etc. When I showed the book to some of my coaching customers of the past week, they were going: \\"Yeah, that makes sense, but how do I do it?\\"  <BR>The good news is that there are many therapists and coaches who should have learned the techniques Baker &amp; Stauth mention.  It would be a good thing for their clients if they start reading and applying this book, in stead of creating \\"victims\\", by leading their patients down the old therapeutic pathways. <BR>Luckily, you don't have to start waiting for the sequel before you can get started on your own:  If you haven't been trained in the tools and techniques the authors recommend, either visit a coach who is willing to help you following these methods or search for a good introduction course in emotional intelligence or NLP to help  you out.<br />Patrick Merlevede, MSc<BR>author of \\"7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence\\"	2003-11-14

David Ulrich's ideas have pretty much defined the HR profession for the last decade.  That by itself is a reason to make sure you've read this book.  What is even more important is that Ulrich &amp; Smallwood outline how HR activities can help to increase the shareholders value as measured in stock price (at least, this is what HR could do, if they would do it right, the reality is that often HR just seems to be wasting money).  Given that shareholders become more and more demanding, that's another good reason to read this book.  So I was a bit surprised to see that this book is not high on the Amazon bestseller list when I'm writing this review (sales rank 12.407 when I wrote this and only 4 other reviews written).<BR>Not only does the book contain a lot of valuable advice, it's structure and writing style make it easy to get the message.  For instance, you'll find most principles illustrated with examples of companies such as General Electric, South West Airlines, Sears, ... and each chapter ends with a section with leadership implications.<BR>While reading the book, I had myself going \\"yes\\" most of the time and I really think that this book should be on your reading list.  So why did I only give it 4 stars?  Personally I would have seen a more provocative writing style, more examples of how other companies screw up, etc. I think that more counter-examples would really have driven the books's message home.	2003-10-31

While Don &amp; Carol's book is also about Business models, their approach is shows more emotional intelligence.  Rather than trying to come up with a revolutionary idea, and then figure out how one get the world to adopt that new idea, they recommend to go for a continuous improvement type of approach.  Part of their message boils down to having more empathy for your customers by listening to what their needs are and then adapting yourself accordingly.  <BR>Given statistics indicate that only 10% of the population are of the \\"revolutionary type\\" (called \\"early adopters\\" in marketing) while 65% of the population is more of the \\"gradual evolution\\" type of person, their approach probably makes more sense to most people around.  The authors probably have come to this conclusion from their 25+ years as strategy consultants, but if one looks at the demise of the dot.com period and at the continuing success of products from the far east, there is lots of evidence to support this point of view.<BR>The basic question of the book is \\"how can your company simultaneously improve costs, adjust prices and provide new benefits in a move to increase the value (or ROI) your product or services represent.  As some other reviewers pointed out, in the past Porter, Drucker, etc have offered theories to answer this question, but this book is far more practical.<BR>The authors give you loads of questions to get you started to think in a more innovative, improvement oriented way about the things you are already doing.  For those of us who claim don't have time, the formatting of the book helps you to pick out thought-provoking questions easily: they are presented in boxes throughout the text and summarized in \\"key questions\\" sections at the end of each chapter.<BR>After reading this book, few excuses are left for not starting to continuouslyregenerate your business model.<br />Patrick Merlevede  author of \\"7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence\\"	2003-10-24

US	52546105	RC4EWIVQAC2WP	0743203186	2748292	What Management Is	Books	4	16	18	N	N	Good introduction to managerial principles	This book, written by 2 former editors of Harvard Business Review, isn't a &quot;how to&quot; book on management, but rather a book giving the \\"big picture\\": clearly describing the rules and concepts that underlie the discipline of management.  Written in easy language, this book fully \\"compatible\\" with what I've been \\"preaching\\" over the last 7 years, but that also means there weren't many new things I learned from it (which explains my 4 star rating).  I think that most experienced managers won't learn too much from this book (at least that's what I hope, but maybe I'm too optimistic, especially given that books as \\"The Dilbert Principle\\" seem to be a \\"fair\\" presentation of the reality of management in some organizations).  <br />That said, let me give you an overview of what you'll get: <BR>The first part, entitled \\"design\\", discusses business issues such as value creation, business models, strategy and organization.  This is clearly a book from after the dot.com era, stressing that it's not technology people want to by, but a product that fulfills a real need, and that this consideration of real added value should drive the business plan (something that many dot.com entrepreneurs seemed to have forgotten).  Once you have your business model, your strategy will make the difference in the marketplace, where you have to face all sorts of competition, and try to outperform them.  Organization, then, is about figuring out how you will structure your company for reaching your strategic goals: what will you do yourself?  What will you outsource, how will the organizational chart and command structures look like?<BR>Where the first section makes clear that good management means having a clear idea of your business, the second part is about making it happen, and thus is called \\"executing\\".  Here the authors discuss topics as mission, innovation, dealing with uncertainty and focusing in order to deliver results.  I especially liked the last chapter of this section, because it stresses that people should be hired for having the right attitude and fitting with the organizational culture (having the same values), an area my company, jobEQ.com is focusing on.  If you want to know more about the Southwest Airlines example that is discussed in this chapter, I recommend the book \\"NUTS!\\" by Kevin Freiberg, et al.<br />Overall, you get a solid book explaining the \\"why's of management in an integrated way I've rarely seen before.  If you are looking for a \\"how to\\" book on management, I recommend PDI's \\"Successful Manager's Handbook\\" in addition to this book.  If you are looking for a how to book on leadership, another new book that I like is \\"Alpha Leadership\\" by Deering, Dilts &amp; Russell.<br />Patrick Merlevede, MSc - co-author of 7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence.	2002-07-07

This book focusses on what a leader should do in practice.  It is written around a simple model I really like. It consists of 3 basic dimensions: Anticipate-Align-Act and 9 principles that come with these 3 dimensions of leadership.  Anticipation requires that one can detect weak signals, has the agility to understand them and that the organization is flexible enough to respond.  Align, the second dimension, is about assuring that the core purpose, values and beliefs of the organization are aligned with the actions of their leaders and their people.  People's attitudes, values and the company culture need to be compatible with each other and this book lists attention areas and tools to increase this alignment.  Finally, the third dimension has to do with acting fast enough, with attention for the 20% that makes the biggest difference and with the willingness to pursue goals with enough determination and patience.  Simple as it seems, one wonders why so few leaders in companies apply this model today. I hope this book will be the stepping-stone some people need to become real &quot;alpha leaders&quot;. <br />It's so well written that's irrelevant whether you have ever heard of NLP. When I wrote &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot;, I wanted to make my book accessible, helping people to develop a practical EQ, using the findings of behavioral sciences such as NLP.  The authors of this book have done the same for the field of management, and I think they've done wonderful job!  The result is a practical book that fits amongst the top business books, and I hope that Wiley will be able to put the needed marketing efforts behind it to turn this masterwork into a bestseller.  <br />It's fully applicable by anyone leading an organization, so that doesn't leave many excuses for not being a good leader... <br />Patrick Merlevede - co-author of &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot;	2002-07-05

However, after reading the book I wonder whether people applying what's written down in this work would have helped to prevent these malpractices, and I must say that I have my doubts.  More specifically, instead of doing some whistle blowing, you might decide to back off, in order to save your career.  That might be \\"emotional intelligent\\" in the sense of understanding the emotional reactions of others against whistle-blowers, but its not really \\"integer\\" according to my definition of that word and thus certainly doesn't fit my European interpretation of being an ethical person.  That explains why from a business ethics point of view, I prefer Linda Tobey's &quot;The Integrity Moment&quot; or even Badaracco's previous book &quot;Defining Moments&quot;.<br />Actually, when I bought the book, I hadn't fully grasped I was buying a business ethics book.  I though I had a leadership book in my hands, which explains my average rating.  While its' true that personal restraint, modesty and tenacity are virtues for leaders, if you want a book on leading quietly, I prefer Jim Collins' &quot;Good to Great&quot; by far.  His level 5 leadership is also a form of leading quietly, but it's much more a book for people willing to lead in the business meaning of that word.<br />Patrick E.C.

At large I agree with her analysis that traditional education feeds us 7 beliefs which aren't very useful once we leave the classroom to go to the school of live.  Actually, these beliefs aren't useful for the classroom neither, but they seem designed into the way schools teach.  As such it should be required reading for anyone considering a career in education or as trainer in a business context.<br />Next to the analysis and showing what goes wrong, you'll get a partial solution, consisting of guidelines of how one can do better.  These guidelines are useful for teachers or trainers as well as for learners.  As teacher it boils down to avoiding the 7 myths, and teaching students to learn more mindfully.  The book backs up this recommendation with the research findings that proves this approach is far more effective.  As learner, the recommendation is that you start having a more mindful attitude while learning.  <br />The book only gets 4 stars, because it would have been more useful if it had been more of a how-to book as well.  That might be an idea for the next edition.  Meanwhile, other how-to books which are compatible with notion of emotional intelligence and which will complement this one are Don Blackberry's &quot;Rediscover the joy of learning&quot; and the books by Michael Grinder.<br />Patrick Merlevede -- author of &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot;	2002-06-20

Epstein's view is that emotions (as opposed to &quot;moods&quot;) always occur after thinking, even if the thinking may be &quot;unconcious&quot; at most occasions.  This view is the opposite from what others, such as Goleman write: they argue thinking come after emotions.  Of course, both parties have &quot;evidence&quot; to back up their claims.  My sugestion:  the two views are useful!<br />The previous paragraph indicates that Epstein's book ONLY covers the &quot;constructive thinking&quot; part of developing emotional intelligence, and if you want a book for that, I must say that he did a great job, building on the work of rational-emotive theraphy and cognitive psychology.  He includes a very interesting questionnaire which helps you to figure out how constructive your current thinking is and gives you tools to avoid boby traps of automatic thinking and to recognize typical patterns of destructive thoughts.  Unfortunately, this book is too limited to be &quot;the&quot; book to increase your EQ in all its aspects.	2002-06-02

One of my friends working for an Ogilvy company recommended Aaker and I must say that he was right.<br />So why did I purchase this book?  Well, given I was called in by an agency to look at the EQ side of one of their projects; I wanted to know what others had written on the topic.  After reading Aaker's book I understand I fell in a trap called &quot;brand extension&quot;.  This works as follows: if you want to launch a new product, look for an existing brand which is available and which you can extend to cover your new product.  In this case, the &quot;product&quot; probably is Marc Gobé's brand creation firm and we all know that emotional intelligence is a label that sells well since Goleman put it on the map in 1996.<br />The problem is that many products sold under the label &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; aren't much related with that, and certainly do not help to raise your EQ.  For me this is the case for this book.  While it contains some useful messages around making sure your product is loved, that customers like the experience of using it (it should be engaging, fulfilling the customer's desire) and that you have to build a relationship with the customer.  The body of the book then shows how there is an emotional link between several marketing aspects and the customer.  Unfortunately, that wasn't really &quot;new&quot; to me, and what's worse, there isn't much &quot;how to&quot; in this book.  In other words, while it may help to raise the awareness of some readers that the emotional aspect is important, that's all it does: it doesn't give you the tools to deal with this.  I suppose Marc Gobé prefers you'd contact his branding agency rather than sharing some of its secrets.<br />In short, even if Aaker's book I mentioned in the introduction of this review is over 10 years old, it remainsmuch more useful than &quot;modern&quot; books like this one.<br />Patrick Merlevede - author of &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot;	2002-05-26
US	52546105	R1736YS1LV8D9A	0521010683	572523055	The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World	Books	4	68	85	N	N	A book to have mixed feelings about	This book was put in the map by the raving review \\"The Economist\\" wrote on this book in September 2001 and by a series of other reviews which appeared in leading media.  I remember reading a favorable review in a British newspaper in early February 2002, which \\"tricked\\" me into buying it.  On the other hand, I'm glad I've bought this book before reading the 32 pages which appeared in Scientific American in January 2002, which does all but destroy the conclusions Lomborg makes throughout his book.  Now that I have it, I think both sides have a point.<br />Bjorn Lomborg has every right to be skeptical about the work done by environmentalists.  He is probably right that they cannot prove many of the claims they make in absolute terms. So far, that is healthy skepticism.  However Lomborg does more than that: he violates that basic rules of skepticism as you find them written down in \\"Fads and fallacies in the name of science\\", the skeptic bible Martin Gardner wrote in 1952 and repeated since on many other skeptic books such as \\"How we know what isn't so\\" by Thomas Gilovich (1991).  My biggest regret is that Lomborg draws his own conclusions about many subdomains of environmentalism without having any authority in that field.  In doing that (already lacking scientific credibility), regrettably, he makes many of the mistakes he accuses other scientists of.<br />As an unfortunate result, environmentalists can easily refute the entire book, by pointing at the many mistakes he makes and in his reply to Scientific American in the April 2002 he fails to give a decent reply to the criticism.  As a result, this book will only help to polarize the \\"believers\\" and \\"non-believers\\".  Those that claim that the disaster is near are fighting those that there is no problem.  Of course, the reality is more \\"balanced\\".  In their attacks or praise for the book, to some extent both parties are generalizing and distorting sections of the text.  But that is something that Lomborg has helped to create.  Critics will say that his main aim was to create controversy, because this results in more copies sold, a claim that is supported by the sales figures of this book.  <br />If you read the last chapter of the book, you'll note that Lomborg concludes that \\"in many areas and over time it will make good sense to invest even more in sound environmental management\\", but he adds: \\"we should prioritize\\".  In the rest of this last chapter he shows his bias: he is a clear proponent of \\"progress\\" and dismisses the environmental fears as \\"pessimism\\".  Because of this bias, he moves from showing that \\"research is incomplete or inconclusive\\" to calling it \\"wrong\\" or \\"litany\\".  An example: he shows (correctly) that the claims that the earths reserves are disappearing fast are overstated, but, it's not because the claim is overstated, that the claim is wrong.  The truth is that oil reserves are limited, only in reality we found that we can keep postponing to take this problem serious, because oil reserves will probably last for our lifetime.  However, Lomborg says in his conclusion: \\"we will not run out of energy\\".   That's not a \\"balanced view\\" anymore: that sentence, taken separately, fails to acknowledge the reality is that one day the earth will run out of oil, and in stead of wanting to mine the oil fields under Alaska, we'd better look for alternatives today (even if Lomborg acknowledges that we should increase non-fossil fuel research).  Moreover contrary to what Lomborg claims, spending more on \\"alternative energy\\" in developed countries will create progress, new learning, new research and will reduce our dependence of oil, which is a misused weapon by the oil countries in the middle-east since the 1970s.  Also, it's naïve to think that if these developed countries would spend less on the environment that their savings would flow to more money for the developing world.<br />This book would have been better served with a more balanced, and neutral conclusion, inwhich some of the sentences would have been written in a more \\"probabilistic\\" style, indicating \\"we cannot know for sure\\".  As I've shown in my own book, and as many authors did, in case of conflict, this is the wrong approach when a conflict looms.  Thus, for me Lomborg doesn't get my sympathy when he writes his own litany about being misunderstood in his reply to scientific Amaerican in April 2002.  By not doing that carefully enough, Lomborg has given a powerful weapon to anti-environmentalists, even if he claims not be one of them.  Moreover, as other review indicate, this ending chapter results in a completely dismissal of his book by environmentalists.  Instead of bridging the gap between \\"progress\\" and \\"care for the environment\\", Lomborg only contributes in widening it.	2002-05-02

That by itself is a reason why every philosopher of science or even every PhD student should consider putting this book in their reading list.  Unfortunately, while I think that some skepticism is a &quot;correct&quot; defense against &quot;pseudo-science&quot;, I cannot agree that this book is supposed to be an example of &quot;good&quot; skepticism.  <br />As another reviewer indicated when discussing the chapter on Korzybski, some of Gardner's chapters are written in a &quot;mud-throwing style&quot;, using several &quot;unscientific&quot; arguments to attack the person, instead of the work they produce.  Calling people ignorant, crackpot, obsessed, quack, ... are just examples.  Another technique Gardner uses is citing elements that have nothing to do with the &quot;scientific claims&quot;.  That approach makes as much sense as judging Clinton's or Kennedy's presidential work by their respect for their marriage... <br />After critical analysis my conclusion is that where Gardner is probably right in attacking many of the theories cited in his book, the method of attack he is using is not scientific at all.  At best on can call this book &quot;fun to read&quot;, if you enjoy mud throwing and stories that destroy people.<br />So, if you want a good course in skeptic thinking, there are other sources I will recommend today.  For skeptics, I recommend &quot;How to think straight about psychology&quot; (Stanovich, 2001) and &quot;How we know what isn't so&quot; (Gilovich, 1991).  For current theories on judging the scientific merits of a theory, books such as &quot;Science and Values&quot; by Larry Laudan (1984) or &quot;Social and behavioral Science Research&quot; (Krathwohl, 1985) are more useful reading. <br />Yet, taken into account some skeptic precautions, I still believe we should give an hypothesis the benefit of the doubt until proven true or false.  In my own book \\"7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence\\", I tried to find a balance between the journalistic interpretations of science and the many claims of techniques helping to improve your EQ on one hand and the lack of \\"scientific evidence\\" for many of these claims on the other had.  Therefore, to compensate a bit, and avoid you fall into the trap of rationalistic &quot;flatland&quot; and reductionism, I also recommend reading &quot;A Guide for the Perplexed (E.F.Schumacher, 1977) and &quot;A brief history of everything&quot; (Wilber, 2001).	2002-04-18

He distinguishes 2 main approaches: clinical interviews VS statistics (psychometric tests) and discusses the pros and cons of both approaches.<br />For decades psychologists have been struggling between the use of tests (statistics) and (clinical) interviews.  I ran into the problem myself when I did a Whiplash study in 1999 and found that many doctors made clear mistakes during the patient's LAB Profile interviews, to such an extend that the produced data was unreliable for further research! Since then, I reluctantly moved over to the testing side and co-developed the iWAM test (see jobEQ.com), but I recommend complementing tests with structured follow up interviews to check the validity of the test answers.<br />One of his main points pro testing is that &quot;Every hour a clinician spends in thinking and talking about whom to treat, and how and how long, is being subtracted from the available pool of therapeutic time itself.&quot; The main counter argument of a clinician will be that every individual is a separate case and thus becomes hard to find in the numbers.<br />In global, one can say that Meehl holds a quite impartial point of view and tries to present approaches in a factual manner, trying to bring them together.

Given that the \\"author\\" uses NLP techniques, I've been analyzing what he does.  I was a bit skeptical initially but I think this is a nice piece of technology.  It shows what one can do when applying NLP principles! Thus, overcoming the yips is a good example of what Goleman would call \\"emotional intelligence\\".

I bought this book on the promise on the back cover that this is a &quot;clear non-technical introduction and that I would get a helpful framework including the key contributions from Hume, Mill, Popper, Lakatos, Kuhn, feyerabend, Bloor, Longino &amp; Van Fraassen.  <br />While reading the book, it becomes quickly clear that this is not a &quot;neutral introduction&quot;, in which the author tries to explain objectively the points of view of the philosophers he discusses, but rather an attempt to prove and defend his own epistemic realism.  Except that I was looking for a neutral &quot;textbook&quot;, one my &quot;problems&quot; with this book is that the author cannot convince me with his arguments against Kuhn, for instance.<br />So if you are looking for a neutral textbook, you'll have to look elsewhere.  If you want a modern point of view that makes more sense to me, I recommend reading &quot;Philosophy in the Flesh&quot; (by George Lakoff &amp; Mark Johnson, 1999).  Their model is more \\"compatible\\" with the paradigm of cognitive science.<br />Patrick E.C. Merlevede, MSc -- author of &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot;	2002-03-20

While someone who is just looking for a entertaining story may be disappointed or even call this book boring, I'm pretty sure that you'll like it if you have some serious interest in Behaviorism or behavioral engineering.  Even if I have a master in cognitive sciences, I didn't find Skinner's ideas *really* \\"incompatible\\" with what I know, even if much of it probably remains to be proven, but the only way to prove it would be to set up such a community.  Some other reviews call it a communist model, but the book actually includes chapters pointing out the differences between fascist and communist models, and Skinner's analysis shows, some 40 years before the Berlin wall collapses why the Soviet Union wouldn't survive.  <br />I wouldn't call this book \\"unscientific\\" or \\"outdated\\" as some other reviewers did.  True, I would enjoy some footnotes to connect Skinner's ideas from this book to the rest of his writing and I'm wondering what would happen if we \\"upgraded\\" this book to take place in the modern internet society and taking into account all new things cognitive sciences and emotional intelligence have brought us over the 50+ years since this book has been written.

He really figured out how and why people are \\"committed\\" to resist change.  Now Kegan offers tools to \\"transform\\" from one level to the next.  Most of the time, when confronted to change, a little voice inside us will tell us why not the change.  According to Kegan &amp; Lahey, this voice speaks with 7 tongues. One could even say that these \\"voices\\" make us immune to change.  Luckily, for each of the 7 languages, this book offers a powerful antidote.<br />What I like about the book is that it's practical.  It includes exercises and models that you can apply in your day to day practice.  As such I recommend it to people who want to get through a transformational stage themselves (as a how-to book) or who want to help others.<br />What I regretted is that  there in no reference section nor any footnotes (contrary to Kegan's other excellent books).  In other words, this book makes it seem that the authors \\"invented\\" all this, while there are several other books (including my own) that offer solutions to several of the roadblocks mentioned here.  To make the reader aware that there are other books helping to get through roadblocks, I especially want to mention Donald Mitchell's \\"The 2,000 percent solution\\", which is more practical for a business context.  But to be fair, this book also includes some new material I haven't seen elsewhere.<br />Recommended!<br />Patrick E.C. Merlevede - author of \\"7 Steps to Emotional intelligence\\"	2002-02-28

I'm still intrigued to find out how exactly he approached science, how he thought about doing scientific work.  While this book gives the reader an acceptable overview of Gregory Bateson's roots and his life, I was particularly disappointed with the section discussing his life since 1970, the year he gave the Korzybski memorial lecture. In these last 10 years of his live he published &quot;Steps to an ecology of mind&quot; (1972), &quot;Mind and Nature (1977) and &quot;Where Angels fear to Tread&quot;.  Paradoxally, this author only met Bateson in 1971 and must have more details about these 10 last years, during which Bateson taught at the University of California at Santa Cruz (1972-1979) and influenced a whole generation of students at the Kresge College.  These last 10 years of his life only get some 25 pages from this author.  In contrast, the history of his family and youth get over 100 pages.  Also, for someone who has had the chance to meet Bateson extensively in order to write this biography, we don't learn much about Bateson's real thoughts, motivations.  All by all this is a pretty dry book.  This book has the merit of existing, yet for me, the author missed some opportunities here.<br />While I recommend everyone interested in social sciences, communication, anthropology or psychology to read Bateson's books, there isn't much to learn from this book by reading \\"about Bateson\\".<br />Patrick E.C.

This book aims at helping the practicing counselor in choosing, administering and interpreting psychological assessment procedures and it does its task well!  It's not a desk manual for the tests themselves, but teaches you about the nature and use of psychological testing, measuring concepts and testing interpretation in sufficient detail so that I recommend it as first choice if you are considering using assessment tools in your counseling practice.  Counseling education should make a book like this one \\"required reading\\". <br />The body of the book (some 340 pages) gives a good overview of what the different types of questionnaires aim at. This includes chapters on intelligence testing, career choice testing, values and interests, personality, and mental health assessment.  Finally, the last section covers professional considerations such as minority testing and testing of special populations, communication of test results and ethical and social issues. All by all, this is a pretty complete book for what a counselor will typically need.  <br />Of course, a book review is not complete without some suggestions for improvement.  Having been building questionnaires for jobEQ.com over the last year as part of my PhD, I certainly have some recommendations.  First, those that know me you might expect me to look for a link to emotional intelligence.  Well, for a book revised in 2002, I found it a bit disappointing that some types of tests such as competence tests (e.g. testing for emotional intelligence) and 360° feedback instruments seem to be missing.  Secondly, linked to my view as an \\"outsider\\" living in Europe, even if it treats \\"cultural aspects\\" this book is less useful at this side of the ocean, because, for instance, most instruments discussed are not translated into most European languages, let alone have European Standard Groups.  Thirdly, the book isn't very critical about validity.  I'd preferred it if it was more outspoken on the validity of certain tests.Also the book would be easier to digest if it included a few extra cases.  And a last thing to mention is the huge difference between what the American Counseling Association (ACA) members pay for this book, and the list price \\"outsiders\\" have to pay.<br />When not to buy this book?  As indicated in this review and in the book's title, this book is aimed at counselors.  If you want to a more theoretical book, helping you to evaluate tests from a test design perspective, I'd rather recommend \\"Psychological Testing\\" by Kaplan & Saccuzzo (even if that is a *very* expensive book).<br />Conclusion: <BR>if you are a counselor, this book is a \\"must have\\"  Especially if you can buy it at the price offered to you as a member of the American Counseling Association, it will be a \\"no-brainer\\" investment.<br />Patrick Merlevede, MSc - author of \\"7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence\\"	2002-02-26

The problem with many people that take NLP courses is that they have difficulty later on to figure out how to apply what they learned.  This author has put her emotional intelligence into practice, by writing a  book which contains what an NLP practitioner would need to start as life coach (or why a life coach would want to follow NLP).  Probably the author would be the first to acknowledge there is more to life coaching than NLP.  Not only does the book describe what the applications are of various NLP models in the life coaching context (in terms of communication skills, rapport skills, etc), it also describes what life coaching is, how to set up a practice, what rules of conduct are for a life coach, etc.  And the book includes the index and the biography, which I consider essential.<br />It's clear that a 200-page book doesn't give all the answers, as it is clear that just reading a book won't make you a life coach.  But this book certainly is a good step on the way.  If you want to apply certain sections of the book in more detail, I recommend that you buy other books the author makes reference to, such as Shelle Rose Charvet's \\"Words that Change Minds\\", if you want to coach meta-programs or \\"Spiral Dynamics\\" by Don Beck a Chris Cowan if you want to use the spiral coaching model.<br />Given that metaprograms and spiral dynamics are building blocks used in jobEQ.com's Work attitude and Motivation and Value Systems Questionnaires, readers that know me won't be surprised that I think the author made an excellent choice of models by focusing on these models...  <br />Final conclusion: a necessary resource if you want to be a good life coach!<br />Patrick E.C.

I must say that I find my money well spent.  In fact, the only reason why this book doesn't get 5 stars is that it's too scientific for practical application.  <br />For instance, chapter 5 is correct to point out that most tests don't measure emotional intelligence, BUT emotional competence, and then goes on to warn us that a test as Bar-on's EQi test certainly has disadvantages, given it is a self-administered test (In my experience, self-administration of EQ-like tests is particularly dangerous for recruiting and other forms of evaluation).  Of course, then the question becomes: BUT I want to test EQ in the context of work, how can I do this in a reliable fashion? You'll find the answer halfway chapter 6, which indicates that Behavior Event Interviews will do the trick (I agree with this, since that's what I experienced as well). Unfortunately, you won't find what kind of questions to ask during such an interview, let alone examples of how to do it.<br />Also, I was glad that the author of chapter 8 pointed out the same pitfalls of hiring senior executives I have been warning companies for. The suggestions that were outline come close to what we have been doing for several customers, but again the real, practical how to's are missing.  <br />The chapters on training emotional intelligence in part three of the book were more useful than the book \\"Promoting E.I.\\", so there is no need at all to buy that other book anymore.  Once again, these 4 chapters contain many of the messages one should have when working to develop EQ.<br />My critique: Except the scientific parts, I found that many of the more practical things this book covers, are \\"old messages\\" that can be found in works of Boyatzis, McClelland, Prochaska, Spencer and Spencer,...<br />Conclusion? Buy this book if you need a solid scientific basis for your knowledge of emotional intelligence.  As far as the how-to's are concerned, this book will serve very well as an outline and a checklist by which one can evaluate the quality of work delivered by a consultant - however, it's not enough to really go out there and \\"just do it\\".  On the other hand, if you are a consultant recruiting or training for emotional intelligence, this is a MUST READ.  Don't get caught not knowing what's in here!...	2001-10-17

Working harder is no option: especially in the US, people have already been increasing their workload in the 1990's.  Nobody seems to have time for the  promised \\"leisure economy\\". Personally, I adhere to these messaged to some extent, but much depends on how they are formulated.<br />Somewhere in the book one can read that Rechtschaffen is a doctor.  Generally, when one is ill it makes sense to see a doctor who prescribes what the patient needs.  I don't know about you, but I don't need a prescription on how you have to organize. <BR> <BR>Rechtschaffen just rehashes the ideas that many others have written about, including Steven Covey, Ram Dass, Daniel Goleman, Harville Hendrixs, Servan-Schreiber, Juliet Schor, ... and that training programs as EST have been training on for over 30 years. That would be defendable if his book would include the best of all these sources.

Graves, a professor of psychology at the Union College (Schenectady, NY) who developed an evolutionary model of values somewhere in the 60ties.  I was introduced to this material through the work of Wyatt Woodsmall, who wrote a more accessible introduction to this material as part of the book &quot;Time Line Therapy and the Basis of personality&quot; (published in 1988). If you are interested in studying values and cultures, I recommend buying both books.  <br />The two reasons why this book only gets 3 stars are 1) the way it is written and 2) because the authors have written it &quot;as if&quot; they are the *sole* owners of this theory, a kind of thinking that shows they haven't reached the highest level of evolution themselves. The second remark may explain why one cannot distinguish between the original thinking of GRAVES and the extensions of the authors.  The first remark explains why this book is hard to \\"digest\\":  the structure of the book doesn't make it easy to collect all information for each level, nor is it easy to derive from the book how one would apply these principles, say in a therapeutic or business context.  Also an index is missing, but that is partly compensated by adding a good resource list at the end of the book.<br />Graves' model is a dynamic model of human consciousness evolution, which includes 7 levels of development, each with particular kinds of thinking and beliefs. At jobEQ we recommend this kind of thinking to find out whether someone you want to hire is &quot;compatible&quot; with your companies culture.  Beck and Cowan have been using Graves work on an even larger level: looking at values that are valid across cultures and subcultures in society, for instance helping to resolve conflicts between subcultures in the UK and South-Africa. <br />Patrick E.C.

You'll find more extended versions of the ideas discussed in this part in other NLP books, such as Bandler's Magic in Action, his &quot;Using your Brain for a change&quot; or the book &quot;Magic demystified&quot; by Lewis &amp; Puchellic.<br />The second and the third part are mostly Wyatt Woodsmall's work.  The second part deals with meta-programs, and borrows heavily on the MBTI (see Myers' &quot;Gifts Differing) and the work of Leslie Cameron and her students (such as Rodger Bailey) - a more extended version of that work can be found in &quot;Words that Change Minds&quot;. In the part on &quot;values&quot; you'll find the Graves model, which in meanwhile also has a full book dedicated to it, namely &quot;Spiral Dynamics&quot; by Don Beck and Christopher Cowan.<br />Unless you are already specialized in the topics covered in this book, you'll find them introduced in a readable way here.  That by itself makes this book a good place to start.  Afterwards you can always find more precise information in to the other books I referenced here.<br />The only reason why the book didn't get 5 stars is because it fails to quote some of the sources they got the material from, especially in the area of meta-programs.  The fact that nobody filed a claim against the authors for that is probably the best proof that this material in now in &quot;the public domain&quot;.<br />Patrick E.C.

Indeed, for a book written in 1994, this book remains surprisingly up to date, except (of course) when it comes to technology. Recruiting is a people business and even in 2001 one still needs to do what the author recommends. (Of course, it would be nice to see it updated: that's why it only gets 4 stars.) Even if the book was written as an introduction to setting yourself up as an independent recruiter, most of it is valid as well for whatever job you want to have in recruiting, whether it is a an employee inside a company or as a consultant working for a large recruiting firm or for a temp agency.<br />Nobody claims that this is the &quot;definite book&quot; on recruiting. Next to this, I recommend to familiarize yourself with competence based recruiting techniques (including behavior based recruiting) and get knowledge on the use of some type of &quot;personality test&quot;. Also, for getting a better grasp of the job you are recruiting for, it pays to \\"pick the brain\\" of some of the best persons already doing the same kind of position in the company.<br />Patrick E.C.Merlevede, MSc. -- co-author of &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot;	2001-09-19

This is exactly what Tara Bennett's book is about, and I strongly support using this kind of techniques. However, this message is not new, not even for the Western World: it also underlies parts of rational-emotive therapy, NLP, etc (these models data back to the early 1970s).  This is my version (based on Leslie Cameron's book \\"Emotional Hostage\\" (1986): <BR>1. Estimate and evaluate your emotional state.<BR>2. If you decide that you can get more enjoyment out of life, decide how you're going to go about it.<BR>3. Promise yourself to really take action.<BR>4. Carry out the actions you have committed yourself to.<BR>5. Evaluate whether the actions you took are having their effect.<br />Bennett rehashes this model, gives you a dozen of applications and a zillion of examples. Given the simplicity of the model explained, I found that the book should have been condensed to about 50% of the current volume. I guess that the reader wouldn't mind! Also, it's difficult to get an overview of what's in this book.  I could have used some more structure and I would have liked some use of graphics, tables and schemas. Also, there are at least 10 other ways to get to better emotional management (and some are more powerful).<br />Patrick E.C.

This doesn't mean the book doesn't have a good content, quite on the contrary, I agree with most of the material that is written in this book and I can only dream that my customers will apply all that's written here. But for me this is a book about TRAINING emotional intelligence, as opposed to a well integrated way to PROMOTE eq. The first 66 pages of the book will explain what emotional intelligence is (in a manner similar to Goleman's &quot;Working with Emotional Intelligence&quot;) and will give an overview of some training programs the authors have looked at (few of these programs are &quot;real&quot; imotional intelligence programs). The next 100 pages explain what one should do to implement a succesful training program (this part is valid for ANY training program and only little of the information is specific to emotional intelligence). In stead of reading that second part, I recommend the &quot;ASTD Handbook of training design and delivery&quot;. Conclusion: given what I previously read, this book didn't add anything new. Of course, depending on your backgrond, this might be different for you. But still, if you are really serious about training emotional intelligence, I'd buy at least 3 other books as well, given that you'll get more in depth information that way. And what if you want to PROMOTE eq at work? Sorry, I guess that that book still needs to be written. Patrick E.C.

Books	5	89	97	N	N	This sales book does what it advertises	I immediately liked the book when I read the Preface, which is about being able to sell exactly as the customer needs it.  I couldn't agree more, even if I have been running intro trouble with 50% of the salespeople I met when trying to convince them of that kind of thinking.<br />Let me first tell you what this is NOT.  - if you want a book that applies my favorite aspect of NLP, cognitive styles (metaprograms), to Sales, I'd recommend \\"Selling the way your customer buys\\" by Marvin Sadovsky & Jon Caswell. <br />- Or if you want a book discussing (theoretical) how to apply ALL NLP models to sales, I'd rather recommend other books, such as Genie Laborde's classic \\"Influencing with Integrity\\", etc. However all these books tend to suffer from the same problem: it's hard to translate their message into practice, because they lack exercises.<br />But if the two previous things aren't what you're looking for, this might be the book for you.<br />How does it compare to other NLP books?  If the book doesn't cover ALL of NLP, it has the advantage that it is much more practical.  You really can use it as a workbook (as the author promises). I guess that a trainer could do a 2 or 3-day workshop to teach salespeople to *really* master this material.   Let me tell you what it includes: It will help you understand how to recognize and use different representation systems (Visual-Auditory-Kinesthetic), buying strategies and non verbal mirroring.  As for the NLP language skills, it concentrates action language and action commands. <br />If the author wants to improve his book, I would recommend adding other NLP models (such as meta-program's and the meta-model).  But to remain as practical, that would boil down to writing a second volume or make this one double the size.<br />As for the price: yes it's expensive.  So is following a workshop.  If you don't use any NLP yet, I agree that the book will pay back for itself if you apply these principles.\\"...	2001-08-18

Only a few books break away from this mold, and Primary Objective is one of them.  Over the last years, the idea to bring NLP messages in story form has been attempted by several authors.  This one had the benefit that I read it to the end (which I can't say of 2 other &quot;fiction type&quot; NLP books).  Indeed, the story line makes sense.  If you (or someone you know) like to read thrillers, with the necessary violent aspect, but want to learn something useful at the same time this book may be something for you.  The scary thing about the story is that many of the &quot;strange&quot; things that happen may indeed be possible if one combines hypnosis, NLP and martial arts (certainly if you know enough about NLP).  A lot of NLP trained people may hope that this kind of application doesn't become real! <br />The second part of the book is a basic NLP training Manual.  In 95 pages it succeeds to cover (in a structured manner) most of the material one will learn in a &quot;classic&quot; NLP practitioner training, even if it misses some of Grinder's &quot;new-code&quot; elements, such as a discussion on perceptual positions.  The material might be worked out further, but then you would end up with &quot;yet another introduction&quot;.  I would rather recommend to complement this book with some of the &quot;selected other NLP reading&quot; that the author recommends.<br />Given that I don't know if I would be able to write fiction, I admire the author's skill.  Yet, If I have to give some suggestions for a second print, I would encourage the author to improve his fiction writing skills even more.  I have no particular advise on how to do it, but I have a feeling there must be ways to improve the packaging of the story.  And maybe the characters of the story could use other NLP models, such as the meta-model and perceptual positions, as well. Finally, Iwonder why the author didn't put the NLP section in a separate book, or dropped it altogether.  By combining both parts in one book, you miss the mysticism that surrounded the &quot;null-abstracts&quot; that A.E. van Vogt published in his science fiction classic &quot;The Players of Null-A&quot; (which were in fact excerpts from Korzybski's work on General Semantics).<br />Still, this is a great job to spread out NLP.  I hope it intrigues some people.<br />Patrick E.C. Merlevede, MSc - co-author of &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot;	2001-08-18

Keep looking - you MUST have a problem!<br />As you can read in many books (including mine), people tend to get what they want.  Unfortunately, most therapists want causes for problems, so ... the patient will get problems.  Yet, using jobEQ.com's iWAM test, we consistently see that people prefer to achieve things, to be successful.  As Ben Furman will ask you &quot;can you imagine going home to your partner this evening and have a nice chap about your problems?&quot;<br />&quot;Solution Talk&quot; is written as provocatively and with more humor than the paragraph above. It presents an alternative way to talk about \\"problems\\" and draws on the traditions of family and brief therapy.  The book is very compatible with NLP, given the authors refer to many specialists well known to the NLP world, such as Gregory Bateson, Milton Erickson, Frank Farrelly, Jay Haley, ...  Everyone who is thinking about visiting a therapist or coach in order to &quot;analyze&quot; what goes wrong should be obliged to read it and so should every therapist.  <br />I met Ben Furman at a conference in May 2001 and was pleasantly surprised by his message.  It motivated me to buy his book, and I'm glad to recommend it to you.<br />Patrick E.C. Merlevede, MSc - co-author of \\"7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence\\"	2001-08-17
US	52546105	R3O89JEBQZ84KS	0743201140	877422266	Now, Discover Your Strengths	Books	3	22	23	N	N	good ideas - execution leaves mixed feelings	I'm happy a book makes it so high on the bestseller list explaining to people that they are better off focusing on strengths (both for themselves, as for the organizations they work for).  At jobEQ.com, we have been &quot;educating&quot; our customers to do the same, and as the authors of this book acknowledge, only 25 to 40% of persons will grasp that notion immediately.  I also appreciate that the authors explain how a manager can use the knowledge of these strengths (or themes) to manage their staff better.<br />If the authors would write a second edition, there are some things that I would recommend them to address.  My first remark is linked to the writing style: this book is written in an &quot;imperative&quot; form: it contains a lot of sentences with &quot;you need to do this&quot;, &quot;you should do that&quot;, ... This style tends to put of people, risking that they miss the message.  Secondly, they have WRONG, OUTDATED notion of the brain: contrary to what people used to say 5 to 10 years ago, the good news of recent research is that brain cells that die of ARE replaced (even if you get older) and you remain capable of forming new connections between brain cells (maybe unless you get a disease, such as Parkinson, ...).  Thirdly: the book does not really address what kind of job would be good for you.<br />Finally some feedback about the test: don't take it BEFORE you read chapter 3 in the book - at least then you will understand how they built it.  Still, I have my doubts about the way it is built.  Using the amount of interviews as a &quot;proof of credibility&quot; didn't impress me: Often for scientific purposes, it doesn't matter much if you did 5.000 or a million interviews - all that matters is that you can validate the test.  Also, I know that most people probably have MORE than 5 strengths, which is just an ARBITRARY number Gallup chose.  Given the importance they address to these 5 strengths, just imagine what opportunities you will miss by ignoring these 2 other strengths.  I would rather prefer to get a FULL picture, getting all my strengths and weaknesses, and having this information ordered from strongest to weakest.  <br />Patrick E.C.

If you haven't heard of him, I'd be surprised.  Stephen's reputation travels even more than he does.  Amongst NLP scholars he is known as Milton Erickson's &quot;best&quot; student, the person that went farthest in deep trance identification with Milton.  He really started modeling Erickson at the point that NLP left off.  I first heard of him in 1993 but only met him in 1997 at the modeling and epistemology class at NLP University in Santa Cruz.  His current work is still very compatible with what you'll read in this book. He maintains a private practice in San Diego and is an internationally known trainer.<br />This book explains the therapeutic use of trance states.  It synthesizes the approaches of Erickson, Bandler &amp; Grinder and Bateson and brings a new perspective that goes even further.  In short the basic idea to &quot;cooperate&quot;: a therapist explores how his client constructs his reality, and then helps to construct new experiential realities, which expand the client's map, with respect for the customer's unconscious thinking.  In other words, the therapist helps the client transform a problem into a solution.<br />Given we consider Stephen as one of our examples, we asked his to write the foreword of our book &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot; and we were glad that he accepted.<br />Patrick E.

Indeed, the book is probably a first full description of the neurobiological foundations of the self (as we understand this today). Yet, Damasio's approach in this book is somewhat reductionistic. It reduces our emotions and our thinking to the facts that a neuroscientist will be able to observe. <br />From that perspective, it's a real masterpiece. On the other hand, it won't be very useful in achieving a higher level of emotional intelligence, since that requires answering a different question: &quot;How do people use the brain?&quot; To compare: it's not because you understand how a PC functions from a technical point of view that you'll understand how to use a program such as an E-mail editor (to give a simple example). From this second perspective, its really difficult for me to accept some of his conclusions on how consciousness causes emotions, especially since for him a mental image is the same as a mental pattern and his definitions for the word &quot;feeling&quot; and &quot;emotion&quot; differ from the convention definitions. Where his neuroscience vocabulary is more detailed than that of an average cognitive scientist, his vocabulary for the cognitive psychological processes is smaller, and as Wittgenstein has stated: &quot;The boundaries of my language are the boundaries of my world.&quot;<br />Near the end of the book Damasio states: &quot;in all likelihood, I will never know your thoughts unless you tell me, and you will never know mine until I tell you&quot;. I agree with him in that his approach won't help him to understand someone's behavior, but I know that many other theories will help me in that area.<br />Patrick E.C.

Contrary to most books that help you write a business plan, this book focusses on your future company's most important asset: YOU.  As this book states, making sure your business is compatible with who you are (your values, your mission), are key elements to build a sustainable business, as are making sure you are ready to do what it takes (having the entrepreneurial attitude).  Also, contrary of many dot-com era business books, it sees growing a business in a slow way (without requiring millions of Venture Capital) as a viable option.<br />So why it didn't I give 5 stars? I think that some of the techniques we teach in our book are better to think about one's mission and values (and to discover them). Also, the way certain topics are introduced as &quot;Buddhist&quot; may put of some readers, which is too bad, given the overall value of this book.<br />Recommended as compatible with my own writings!

This book is more than \\"just another science fiction novel\\".  It comes with a message: to get further in life, you have to get yourself to thinking sane. As a solution, consider \\"non-aristotelian thinking\\".  Several chapters of this book start with \\"quotes\\" of this \\"null-A\\" thinking, sometimes referring to Korzybski's book \\"Science and Sanity\\" (yes, it's available from Amazon)!<br />Actually several SF fans I encountered, including Denis Bridoux, my co-author for the English version of \\"7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence\\", got intrigued in this \\"general semantics\\" thing.  In fact, if it weren't for this book, I would never have met Denis. As such, we should have mentioned Van Vogt in the Acknowledgements of our book. Given the age of this book, it is still refreshing reading: a real SF classic that kept its quality despite its age.  Indeed, the whole idea of nul-A thinking is still ahead of our times, despite that the principles were stated more than 68 years ago!  Of course, for those wanting to learn to think in a null-A manner, there are now more accessible books, such as \\"Drive Yourself Sane, Using the Uncommon Sense of General Semantics\\" by Susan Presby &amp; Bruce Kodish.

It contains questionnaires to diagnose which lifetraps may apply to you and to what degree (ranging from &quot;does not apply&quot; to &quot;a core lifetrap&quot;).<br />If you have to face such a lifetrap, I adhere to the idea of working out a multidisciplinary approach to treat the lifetrap. The idea is to both deal with the problem source as it comes from childhood, as well as to teach behavioral skills (related to emotional intelligence). Yet, I agree with the authors that self-help books may make change seem easier than it actually is, especially if you have to deal with problems as the ones they describe. <br />To get a fifth star, the book would have to be expanded with examples of less serious childhood problems, or to include people that only have to cope occasionally with the lifetrap symptoms. Also, I would like to see some more positive examples, or what one has to do if one had the luck to live a &quot;normal&quot; childhood.  Finally, this book is more focussed on the therapeutical part, than on the behavioral part (emotional intelligence skills) needed to have the full multidisciplinary solutions the authors adhere.<br />Patrick E.C.

Even if you financial life isn't in disarray, and if the amount of dept you have is very limited, there is much emotional intelligence in this section, and its messages are worth thinking about: The author shows how negative emotions as shame, guilt, fear and anger influence bad financial decisions, she shows how negative thoughs and words, in combination with lack of goal oriented thinking may stop us from achieving what we want.  She shows how material clutter doesn't do much good neither and hert advice to walk through your house and look for items you do not longer use and other stuff that is &quot;just filling closets&quot; is something that too many people suffer from. Just applying this first section might pay back for the book.<br />As for section 2, marketeers won't be happy, but some of the advice is well worth considering.  For instance, an exercise in Chapter 4 makes you consider this as: &quot;How much money would you save if you drove your car one extra year?  And waited one more year to upgrade your computer? Or to redecorate that room in your house?&quot; As the author is right to state, many people are trying to &quot;keep up with the Jonesses&quot; and are envious if their neighboor seems to be living in better financial conditions. The same section tackles the issue of credit card debt, a problem that is quite common is one looks at macro economic figures but a dept that often is doing a lot of damage to people's self-worth.    For non-US readers: some of the practical advice is US-centric.  I have no use of 401k plans, US divorce and social systems, I don't have to pay taxes in the US, I do not have to save to pay the college or education of my kids, I'll be able to &quot;survive&quot; on my retirement money, etc. (thank god I live in Belgium, and that our social system takes care of all that!)<br />The title is a bit too much hype to my taste.  That's why this book lost a star.  Yet, thereis some thruth in it. Another book that contains similar lessons is &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; by Stanley and Danko.  They came to these conclusions by studying millionaires.  Their book preesents their findings, whereas Orman's book is more practical.<br />Patrick E.C.

He considers them as a resource for helping people to think beyond their boundaries, and I agree with him.  <br />This book picks up where the third of David Zindell's books left the reader.  However, there is no need to have read previous books: since the author will recapitulate what you read in the previous 3 ones. As refreshing as the first books were, for me, this one was rather \\"more of the same\\".  Of course, given the quality of the previous books, that's still a compliment. So, I enjoyed reading it, being on holiday, but I didn't find any new messages that may help the reader to break through it's own thinking (as Zindell's previous books did)....	2001-07-16

That's why I hesitated to give this book \\"4 stars\\".  I also agree with the author that one will have to do one's homework (try out the material) if one wants to get most out of it. As the author writes, such a book is NOT meant to be passive reading. <br />Unfortunately, the way these principles are packaged didn't help me to do something constructive with this book.  The writing style and the examples activated a skeptic attitude in me.  As the author acknowledges on page 25, there is a serious risk that you'll start challenging every word he writes.<br />So what exactly is my critique? First, if you're not an Oprah fan, the first 10 pages of this book will put you off reading the rest. Secondly, the author gives the impression he has invented the wheel (yes, one still can invent the wheel, a Canadian even showed that one can PATENT the wheel in 2001!).  Of course, as the author writes, he collected the principles to learn from elsewhere.  Unfortunately, often the original versions are more precise than what you'll find here.  Yet, it is difficult to check that, given there is no reference section in the book, and only a few of the sources get cited. (Hint: look at books based on NLP, as the ones you'll find in my \\"listmania\\" lists).<br />To me, this book mostly proves that being on Oprah's show will help your book to &quot;make it&quot;.  In fact, I wonder who would have known about this book if the author wouldn't have been connected with Oprah (if you didn't know that, the author will spend at least 5% of the book explaining you that). <br />My conclusion?  If you buy this book, I hope you will walk away with the principles. Given my critique, I have no clue how big your chances are.  If you are living in the U.S., *VERY* found of Oprah, and willing to do the assignments the author gives you, this book may fit you. Otherwise, better look elsewhere.<br />Patrick E.C.

This book triggered much of the research that lead to Ulric Neisser's book &quot;Cognitive Psychology&quot;. The five stars I gave are related to the importance of this book - when reading this book in 2001, without taking this background into account, I would still rate it 4 stars.<br />This book argues that our behavior is guided by our plans.  People move from sub-goal to sub-goal until their purposes are achieved. A basic concept to explain that is the feedback loop which comes from engineering and is know as the TOTE model inside the NLP community. When NLPers try to model a person's strategy (e.g. for taking a decision), they are in fact looking for the basic building blocks of the TOTE. This books contains a chapter on &quot;Plans for Speaking&quot;, showing the link between Miller and Chomsky, another father of modern cogintive science (and NLP).<br />Of course, if you just want to grasp the basic concept, there is no need to read this book given that many books that are linked to practical applications of cogitive science (such as NLP) will include the model.  For instance, the first part of the third chapter of my book &quot;7 Steps on Emotional Intelligence&quot; is built around on the TOTE model.<br />I consider this book a &quot;must&quot; for any scolar of cognitive science in general and of NLP in particular that wants some background on their domain.<br />Patrick E.C.

At jobEQ, our customers are astonished when they see the precision and the accuracy we achieve through applying metaprograms as a recruiting and management tool. <br />The only constraint this book doesn't solve is how to apply this technology when you have to &quot;profile&quot; 1200 persons (as I have done over the last 8 months) - hint: at that point you need to automate the process, as we have done at jobEQ with the iWAM test.<br />But until today (2001), no other books on meta-programs is so practical.

For instance, specialists will tell you it can take 7 years before you really change a company's culture. No wonder people like Art Kleiner (co-author of &quot;The Dance of Change&quot;) will warn you that up to 70% of your change efforts will fail.  The solution comes from taking a more systemic approach, involving as much people of the organisation at once as possible. These kinds of large scale interventions often do wonders if the management is willing to work in a more participative manner.  Some methods are more directed to specific change goals, whether it is to set a new direction for your organisation or redefining working relationships (re-organising the buisiness); other methods are more adaptable.<br />This book will help you find your way in the world of large scale interventions. The 18 proven group methods each have a chapter, written by originators and/or foremost practitioners. Each method-chapter includes a case, the explanation of the methodology, the conditions to success, the theoretical basis, etc. In the back of the book you'll find a table describing all 18 methods (explaining how many people can be involved, how lang the change process takes, how it impacts the organisation, etc.).  Once you have found which method fits your situation, you'll find references to more specific books explaining a particular method. Another book painting the big picture as well is Barbara Bunker's &quot;Large Scale Interventions&quot;.<br />I recommend the book as a place to start, if you are prepared to treat your organisation as having more EQ than each of the individuals. <br />Patrick E.C.

If you are suffering of cancer or have a relative that is terminally ill and has been given up by doctors, I recommend this book as a &#8220;second opinion&#8221;.  <br />This book tells the story of how an alternative treatment was sabotaged by the medical community and by organizations that are supposed to protect our health (such as the Food and Drug Administration). As a European, I have been quite skeptical about this agency for some time, and this book doesn&#8217;t help at all!  The picture this book gives you is that the main reason a drug gets accepted or not might be linked to serious lobbying inside the conventional medical community and to the financial gains that are linked to it.  This isn&#8217;t hard to believe if you see how the tobacco lobby succeeded for years to cover up the problems smoking causes.<br />Yet, there is hope as far \\"conventional medicine\\" is concerned. Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) teaches doctors that they should stay current with recent research on drugs and learn how to interpret studies before administering drugs to their patients.  I studied this subject in preparation of my Ph.D.  I believe that EBM practices do drastically enhance our chances as patients to get the right treatment, especially if you read that 50% of doctors risk giving you a wrong or outdated treatment.  No wonder many doctors admit that many patients get better DESPITE their doctor&#8217;s treatment.<br />The problem with EBM is that apparently some often used treatments such as many current forms of chemotherapy lack the statistical data to back them up, and that doctors seem to treat patients with those cures because they don&#8217;t have anything better.  When I was doing my own research concerning whiplash, I was faced with a similar dilemma: conventional treatment in which patients have to wear a cervical collar may actually worsen the condition of patients.  Yet 50% of MD&#8217;s still prescribe it today.  On the other hand, if you would recommend a patient to throw away this collar, you might be pursued form &#8220;medical malpractice&#8221;.<br />On the other hand, I have known for years that the problem of many alternative cures (whether they are herbal remedies or psychological assistance) lies in the fact that they have not been proven scientifically.  But, not being proven doesn't mean that the cure isn't valid, it only lets you know there is no way to tell.  Therefore I keep trying to convince &#8220;alternative therapists&#8221; to do the necessary &#8220;homework&#8221; with regards to proving their protocols.  The drama is that it doesn&#8217;t pay to do the scientific research for those cures, whereas there are billions to be gained from doing research for registered drugs.<br />Given that the death rate of cancer today isn't much better than in the 1950s, it's no wonder that today over 60% of cancer patients supplement their conventional treatment with one or more forms of alternative treatment.  Reading this book should at least help you to be a bit more skeptical to what your doctor is telling you, and to be more willing to inquire for yourself what therapy will help to cure you.<br />Related books: &#8220;The Cancer industry&#8221; and &#8220;Questioning Chemotherapy&#8221; by Ralph Moss...	2001-06-26

Out of respect for her work, I keep refering people to this book.  <br />The biggest &quot;mistake&quot; of this book is that it appeared 10 years too early, long before Goleman made the term &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; popular. Yet it does a far better job than Goleman when it comes to helping people to increase their EQ.<br />Leslie Cameron is one of the co-founders of NLP, even if she now has moved on and seems to be &quot;lost&quot; to the NLP community.  I keep wondering where the field of emotional intelligence would have stood if Leslie would have kept up her work in this area.<br />Conclusion: even now this remains one of the best books on the topic of emotional intelligence.

These models make great tools for selection, training and development, appraisal and succession planning.  Unfortunately, until I came accross this book, I found that most of the reference works to this field are quite unaccessible, not the kind I would put into the hands of a newcomer.  This is a practical book, showing why competency models are important and helping the reader to go through the complete process of setting up such a system, including a chapter on how to sell the idea to others in the organisation - I wish some of the people I work with would have read this book before, that would have smoothened the problems that are caused if these steps aren't followed well.  The book also shows how to transform your competence model into a 360° feedback questionnaire.  It was the first time I came accross a book explaining how to do that!  The only area that I found a bit weak is the compentency-interview (both for building the model, als doing behavior-based interviews for recruiting), but maybe that's a bias coming from my own expertise in that domain (my book &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot; includes a full chapter on how to ask the right questions).<br />Conclusion - whether you know about Competency Models or not - add this book to your library!  And if you are a consultant in the field of competency models, this is a book you might recommend to your customers.<br />Patrick E.

NLPers (including myself) often use this expression from Korzibsky methophorically to indicate that what we are saying or percieving is only a part of reality.  Much of NLP as a field (as well as of my book on emotional intelligence) has to do with taking apart our &quot;subjective experience&quot; and trying to avoid mixing up what we think (our interpretation) with &quot;hard facts&quot;.  <br />NLP borrows some of its ideas in this area from a field known as &quot;general semantics&quot; and points to Korzibsky and his writings. But there is a &quot;small&quot; problem&quot;: most people I've met find &quot;Science and Sananity&quot;, Korzibsky's main book, &quot;quite challenging&quot; to read (to say the least).<br />For me, the authors of this book have succeeded to render the ideas of General Semantics more accessible.  What I appreciated especially was that this book does more than explaining Korzibsky's concepts: it also makes them usable as a tool to formulate what you want to say, so that you prevent being misunderstood (in stead of having to catch up after that people have misunderstood you).<br />Whether you have had NLP training or not, if you want to communicate in a way that helps to avoid misunderstanding, this book may be a welcome source for help!<br />Patrick E.C.

After an introduction, the topic is covered from the point of view of the individual, the manager and the organization.  It discusses the effect of legislation, reward systems, how to set up an ethics program, etc.  These different sections basically stand alone, so you can go straight to the section you need.  You get a pragmatic approach, it is &quot;all a manager in a US company should know about ethics&quot; and packed with concrete examples (the 1999 edition added some new recent examples). Or: &quot;when in doubt, read the book and you'll know what to do.&quot;  <br />It is clearly written as a educational volume, for instance chapters ends with cases and discussion questions.  <br />As inconveniences I would say it is very biased towards the USA (it's packed with references to US law), even if it contains a chapter on global business.  Also, the text is quite prescriptive and I lacked some philosophical depth.  If you live outside the US, some explanations and examples are too simplistic and not relevant (for instance, to a Belgian it's quite surprising that this book says that you should not write a recommendation letter on your company's letterhead).  Therefor, I recommend &quot;Baradacco's &quot;Defining Moments&quot; (1997) as complementary reading. Given its educational aim, I think its price is too high as well.<br />That said, if you need a pragmatic book on this topic, this is the place to look.<br />Patrick E.C.

This book applies the principles of several NLP models that Dilts has been developping over the years to the domain of leadership.  This includes &quot;neuro-logical levels&quot; (alignment between mission, values and competencies/ going from vision to action / situating leadership models on their logical level, ...), &quot;Walt Disney's creativity strategy&quot; (creating the future, turning dreams into reality), several belief strategies (e.g. for assessing motivation for change), ... The formats, worksheets and exercises in this book are typical for Dilts and may be well known for those that have read some of this other books, but if you haven't read anything from him or you want to apply his work in the business world, this material will be very useful.<br />I can say that Robert Dilts is of the &quot;Giants on whose shoulders I stood&quot; when I started my work on the topic of emotional intelligence. When I started my company, &quot;Acknowledge.net&quot;, I've been putting much of the content of this book into practice myself and developped some of my current thinking from there on.

I knew he had been &quot;working&quot; on this topic for the last 2 years and that he had been applying some of the principles I teach in my emotional intelligence classes.  Apparently, this hadn't been enough to solve his problem, but it was enough to come back to me to seek my advice.  This was one of the books I bought to document myself on the issue.<br />This book was a good resource by providing me different points of views concerning the question, and by pointing out that it's not a simple matter of making a choice (for instance, one lead by intuition and emotions, as is recommended sometimes).  The cases presented point to several kinds of dilemmas: the personal ones (choosing between what's right for you and for the organisation), the managerial ones (choosing between the organisation and the people that ore working for it) and the social ones (choosing between the organisation and the larger social system it's a part of).  The book also points out different sources we have for basing our decisions on.<br />The problem remains that values and principles often point into different directions.  Ethical choice techniques such as the &quot;sleep-test&quot;, the &quot;golden rule&quot; and other sources of inspiration do not solve this.<br />Learning from that, it becomes clear why one should not expect to find the answers to your ethical problems in this book.  Finding &quot;the&quot; answer is &quot;impossible&quot;.  In a &quot;defining moment&quot;, you will have to examine which values you are committed to, these values will be put to test (will you go for their implications) and they will shape your future.  I believe (with the author) that there are no easy answers to the *real* issues we are faced with. That's why this book shows in what way you have to search for your answer.  Reading this book will at least allow you to ask the right questions andto look at various aspects in order to make a personal choice.<br />If I would have read this book earlier, my own book would certainly have included a reference to it.<br />What will I tell my customer?  Well, writing the &quot;code&quot; won't be enough, in stead we should focus on teaching people how to make an ethical choice.<br />Patrick E.C.

First writing down values and guiding principles is necessary.  It&#8217;s important to know what&#8217;s important and making sure our staff and our stakeholders buy into these values. This requires communication. Secondly, writing mission and values won't be enough. The question is how we will put our values into action.  It&#8217;s in the action that you will see how committed people are to the values.  Commitment will mean that people&#8217;s behavior is aligned with the mission and the values.  Not only does this mean that our values have to be written in a way they provide guidance for this.  <br />Once you know this, reading the book is a waste of time.  In fact I learned nothing from this book.  The *real* challenges are formulating the mission and values in such a way that people REALLY buy into them.

I believe Appreciative Inquiry may be one of the most important &quot;discoveries&quot; of the end of last century.  For me, it seems it offers the answer to many work-related problems that persons in my workshops on emotional intelligence experience, problems to which I can only teach them on how to handle those problems for themselves, by developping their emotional intelligence.  <br />Appreciative Inguiry and related methods offers ways to obtain real, systemic change in an organization.  Still, this is maybe not the book you're looking for.  If you want a more modern publication, I recommend the books entitled &quot;Appreciative Inquiry: Rethinking Human Organiation Toward a Posotive theory of Change (Cooperrider et al, 2000) as a more &quot;serious&quot; sourcebook (containing papers) or &quot;Appreciative Inquiry: Change at the speed of imagination&quot; (Watkins &amp; Mohr, 2001) as a more practical &quot;how-to&quot; book.<br />I felt a bit &quot;cheated&quot; by the mention &quot;revised edition&quot;.

There isn't even a new foreword from 1999.  Also, checking the references, I couldn't find anything that indicated more recent stuff than the materials from 1988.

I was introduced to Erickson's work through the work of Bandler and Grinder, now known as NLP (I got my NLP trainer certificate in 1996). This book doesn't cover the modern NLP as I know it, nor does it cover the work of Steven Gilligan, but apart from that it includes a brief overview of frameworks that explain Erickson's Therapy and Hypnosis (e.g. Haley, Rossi, Lankton, Zeig, etc).<br />Now you know what the book does and doesn't cover, let me tell you what it aims at. The author wants to make Erickson's work accessible and to unravel the underlying structure of Erickson's marvelous interventions, which were often beyond the comprehension of his students.  The goal of the book is to offer the reader a set of patterns that will result in therapeutic interventions of the same style as those used by Erickson himself.  It also includes principles, assumptions to be avoided and illustrates the whole with examples from Erickson himself.<br />I think the author has done well on his goal, especially given the reputation of his subject.  In general, this is a very accessible book which doesn't require any previous knowledge.<br />Patrick E. Merlevede,  Author of &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot;	2001-06-15

If you can do that, the results will be way beyond expectations. The question then is: &quot;How does one energy people to get behind goals?&quot;  <br />This is a book about tapping an organization's &quot;hidden reserve&quot;: the miracles people can perform if they are empowered to do so and if they understand the urgency of doing it.  As the author indicates, the way companies are structured often discourage people to share their knowledge and to get this kind of performance.  <br />The book presents guidelines for moving in the right direction, quite obvious messages such as making people accountable, giving them measurable goals (linked to the bottom line and having short-term first step) and assuring that people can really do things they like to do (by having people share their solutions). <br />In short, the message is simple, it has been told several times and still it seems difficult for people to really put it into practice.  What is alarming to me is that I bought this book in 1992 and it didn't help me much, even if I recognize the values of the principles explained here.  In fact, these principles surface is concepts such as &quot;SMART goals&quot; and in the &quot;Balanced Scorecard.<br />To really make this work, I discovered one needs to complemented by principles such as systemic thinking, participative management and visionary leadership.

Ask the question above to managers of an organization and the answer will be &quot;about 15%&quot;.  According to a study by Lynda Gratton, Author of &quot;Living Strategy&quot;, many of us are working in companies where neither our colleagues nor we feel inspired.  A 1996 study showed that the percentage ranged between 19 and 8% for companies such as HP, GlaxoWellcome, Citibank, ... Similarly, less than 20% of people feels that the top management is well informed about what people at lower levels think and do. Answers to other questions are better but still: When questioned on integrity, 70% people at the best company of the tested group believed their employer has high integrity, whereas this figure dropped to less than 35% an the least &quot;integer&quot; company of this leading edge research consortium.    It's the author's aim to create inspirational companies, which build hope, trust and excitement.  When you see the figures above, this clearly is needed. In fact, I discoveed this book when a customer asked me to help them to work on their &quot;integrity&quot;.<br />The least this book will do is serve as an eye-opener.  Given what I came accross in companies, that by itself is already important. I have to agree with the author that very few companies understand the relationship between increases in revenue and employee emotions.<br />The approach the author presents for &quot;tackling&quot; this enormous task clearly has its advantages over &quot;older&quot; models of managing human resources.  However, I recommend to complement this book with messages you'll find in Peter Block's &quot;Flawless Consulting Fieldbook &amp; Companion&quot; and in David Cooperrider's &quot;Appreciative Inquiry: Rethinking Human Organization&quot;.

If you work as a consultant and want to learn your customers how to fish (in stead of giving them fish), BUY this book!  If you have consultants walking around in your organisation, make sure they apply these principles!<br />After reading this, you'll understand why re-engineering processes fail, why the balanced scorecard isn't \\"the\\" solution\\", why teaching people skills sometimes has no impact, why implementing SAP is so hard and why people in companies are very sceptic if you suggest any of these \\"popular\\" solutions.  In fact, all these solutions share the same underlying principle: some knowledge and procedures need to be added to the company to \\"fix\\" problems.  This notion is wrong!  Overcoming resistance to change has to do with giving people a chance to participate.<br />When studying projects of famous consultants and big 5 consulting comapnies, I have often wondered: \\"Why did the implementation of this project fail?\\"  My first personal lesson was that PEOPLE matter more than methodology and tools.  (I have been writing about this for years...).<br />Next to this first learning, I knew that it's not the consultants that have to bring the solution, it's the persons IN the organisation.  And I have been looking for years for solutions to this paradox (being a consultant, that is).  SO: methodology IS important: if you use a methodology which will mine the knowledge of the company as a WHOLE, you are the enabler of the change.  As a consultant, you do not have to bring the CONTENT, the knowledge of WHAT needs to be changed, but you have to GUIDE the change process, and bring knowledge to the organisation so that they can change themselves. This book is one of the few that will really help you understand which processes are needed for this (many of the 30+ people that helped to write this book have a proven track record in this area). <br />If you don't know how to put systemic thinking into practice (or you think it's just about designing a solution with the system in mind), and/or if you haven't heard about whole-scale change, apreciative inquiry or the engagement paradigm, this is a good place to start: you will literally discover a new way of consulting, one that lives up to the title of this book and might even really enable \\"flawless\\" implementation processes.<br />And if putting this book into practice isn't flawless: go to the last chapter: Peter Block added a \\"trouble-shooting guide\\" that helps you get trough 12 common roadblocks.<br />Make consulting flawless, learn how to make people share THEIR solution.<br />Patrick E.C.

Its choice is inspired by the fact that the authors try to promote the balanced scorecard as THE solution to *any* problem a company has.  I agree on the value of Balanced Scorecards as a measurement tool.  I also acknowledge the fact that what you measure will strongly influence the path your organization will follow.  (One of the discoveries of sytems thinking is that the fact of measuring something changes the system.) However, there is MORE to strategy and to human motivation than just making measurable goals.  As the authors note, an important question for strategy is whether it gets implemented, but measurement or scorecards aren't key in that. For stragegy, one needs to energize the whole company-system, so you have to combine scorecards with principles as the one you'll find in books as &quot;Appreciative Inquiry&quot; or &quot;Whole-Scale Change&quot;.  Likewise, for human motivation you have to make sure you get the right person on the right place (as we show at jobEQ.com) and as you can read in my book &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot;. Indeed, my experience has learned me that when Balanced scorecards fail, the reason has to do with the factors that these other books will mention.  My rating for this book is the result of the observation that Kaplan and Norton &quot;overstrech&quot; the usability and impact their useful technology has.	2001-06-11

Conclusion: if you want to test your EQ, buy this book.  If you want to develop it, look elsewhere.	2001-06-10

The idea of focussing on the positive aspects and to grow from the is very powerful (in fact, I spent the last issue of my 7EQ newsletter on this topic).   The number of awards won by authors and projects described in thsi book only confirms this statement. This book will explain you the why's of AI, give you some cases and show its relation to other large scale methods.  It's not meant as a book you'll read from coer to cover, but rather as a resource from which you'll get what you need.  The 18 chapters of this book are in fact 18 papers, some are written especially for this book, some have been published elsewhere, starting with the original &quot;Appreciative Inquiry&quot; Paper by David Cooperrider and Suresh Srivastva (1987). Many of the other papers have been published in the OD Journal and the OD practitioner between 1995 and 1998.	2001-06-10

Here is what I wrote: Whether you are working as a consultant or are planning to become one, this book is for you!  It really covers all aspects of what it means to be a consultant.  Maybe that's why this book ended being 375 pages thnk, in stead of the initially announced 250 pages.  Carol Harris knows what she is talking about: she has been an independent consultant for the last 15 years and wrote 4 other books.   The first and second chapter discusses the kind of competencies and attitudes a consultant needs.  Chapters 3 to 6 discuss what is means to set up as an independent consultant, how to promote yourself etc (maybe you conclude from these chapters that you would be better of to be working for one of the consultancy agencies).  The rest of the book teaches you skills related to practical aspects of being a consultant, such as self-management, helping other to develop, writing skills, etc.  In short in this book you'll find what a consultant needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.  Of course, I cant resist mentioning that for other areas of live, my book &quot;7 steps to emotional intelligence&quot; will be complementary!	2001-06-07

Robert Dilts is one of the few authors actually using NLP as it was meant to be.

At that time, the ideas in this book departed quite strongly from the orginal \\"mechanistic\\" NLP framework.  Today, some of the messages from this book still aren't \\"integrated\\" in mainstream NLP (which is a \\"buy\\" reason).  Focus of this book lies on perceptual positions; trusting your unconcious (+ focussing your attention), and working with patterns (+ how to interrupt them). These are 3 messages that Grinder still stresses today (in 2001) and thet influenced my own thinking when I wrote \\"7 steps to Emotional Intelligence\\".  Grinder still trains the material of this book on a regular basis in France (see [...]) - reading this book is the \\"next best thing\\" if you can't make it to Paris. That said, to mine this book's content, you'd better have studied some NLP first: given that it is a transscript of a typical Grinder/Delozier workshop, structure isn't one of its strongest points...	2001-05-08

It won't be of much use without the other volume, since it describes in small detail (by the hour) how to run a whole-scale workshop, the preparatory sessions, etc. However, if you want to bring it in practice, than you HAVE to buy this book.  I'm amazed that consultants are giving away such a treasure chest of information: if you have &quot;what it takes&quot;, you can really *do* this without needing their help (of course, some emotional intelligence, as explained in &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot;, will be of help.)	2001-05-08

This book shows the way! I met Kathleen Dannemiller at the first World Congres on Systemic Thinking (May 1-6 2001, Vienna), and I really apreciated the message she had for the public. Probing further, I discovered that the method has generated impressive results as well!  One of the examples has been a Whole-Scae process with the people involved in making the Mustang IV a success.  At the moment Dannemiller was called in (around 1991), Ford was thinking about dropping the Mustang.  In stead of asking what the problems where, people from throughout the organization were asked to dream about the &quot;new&quot; Mustang and how to make this dream come true.  that car was developped in about 2 year's time, costed 22% less to build than a Mustang III and had limited problems at introduction.  Some people at Ford even quote this car's introduction as &quot;scary&quot;, because everything went almost as planned.  One would wonder why Murphy's law didn't apply.  The answer is simple: all people felt involved and they felt had to make this car a success. If you ask me what's missing?  Well, dannemillers knowledge op people skills is &quot;unconcious&quot;: her techniques do not cover the emotiunal intelligence one needs to make all this work.  But that's where a book such as &quot;7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence&quot; will give you the answers.	2001-05-08

As well as he would make it to the top 5 list of NLP's great writers.  Being one of the sudents of Dilt's Modeling &amp; Epistemology class at NLP University, I'm quite familiar to Dilt's ideas about modelling. Much of the thinking explained in this explains the process I've been going through while writing &quot;7 steps to emotional intelligence&quot;. The great point of NLP modelling is that it focusses on people that are excellent in a certain area (have a certain competence, supported by certain beliefs)- this book describes how you derive &quot;the pattern that connects&quot; by studying several experts in a domain. You get the &quot;how&quot; as well as examples of NLP modelling.  The only problem is that it takes a considerable level of NLP skills before you can put this book into practice.	2001-05-08

Robert has been writing a dozen of books since that time, including the &quot;Strategies of Genius&quot; series, which came the closest to the original feat.  The current encyclopedia is the result of years and years of work: I saw the first version of the first 3 letters at the NLP leadership conference in summer 1997, 3 years before the book finally came out. The only inconcenience about this encyclopedia is that it is too biased.  This is clearly the Encyclopedia of &quot;Dilts' NLP&quot;<br />Still, this is a book that persons that are really serious about NLP (e.g. people training NLP) should own. END	2001-04-20

The book offers a good and complete overview of what training is all about. If you know something about training, you will find out how much you already know. A nice feature of this book is its use of brain maps to offer a section overview, and really each chapter ends with an overview, offering the key points. My conclusion?
