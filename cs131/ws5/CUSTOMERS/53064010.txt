The true story of Holocaust survivor Jack Oran, aka Yakoff Skurnik in the days that he passed through the web of concentration camps that marked the baseline of WWII in Nazi Germany. Yakoff's ability to make the best of a bad situation is remarkable in itself as each moral and ethical dilemma raises its head. What allows the human being to survive man's inhumanity to man is a crucial awareness, now more than ever. When concentration camp prisoners were being fed/starved on a scientifically devised diet that actually calculated how long it would take them to starve, the ability to forage for food allowed Yakoff to stand out as a man among men.  When he was able to provide warm clothing in trade for other items camp members were in need of, his importance in camp society increased. When the number tatooed on his arm spoke of his ability to outlive many, many others, he even earned the wry respect of the camp guards.<br /><br />Beyond these factors, written clearly as a labor of love, is the tale of the experiment itself -- whose purpose is never explained, as it is never clearly understood. Yakoff and several others were physically and medically castrated by camp doctors, without effective anesthesia. This is really not the story of the experiment, but one man's story of how he experienced it, lived with it, and overcame it in a world where manhood is defined by what your genitals are capable of. For Yakoff, it is a loss beyond comprehension, as even his own father, beyond compassion,  is humiliated in his own ego when he hears of it -- his son is no longer his son. Yakoff's father, himself facing remarkable odds and having to perform incredibly horrendous \\"chores\\" as a Kapo preparing fellow Jews for the gas chamber by reassuring them they are \\"only showers\\" so there will be no panic, cannot face his son when next their paths cross because of the shame of the castration, a shame that surpasses his own.<br /><br />What makes the Nazis stand out is far beyond their physical brutality. What makes the Nazis, and others like them, stand out is their morbid focus on playing with peoples minds, hearts and souls and breaking their spirit. In many cases and in many ways they were successful, as in the case of the \\"musselmen\\" who simply caved in to death and refused to eat and waited for the inevitable. Those who made difficult choices in the name of survival do not consider themselves to be heroes. Still, they do point to the ability of the human spirit to survive in the face of adversity. Not all of us do -- but many of us can. It is all in the choices we make.physical brutality.

Perhaps the reader needs more of a background in WWII and the various and sundry characters in order to follow them around (there are so many!); while I am more interested in the facts. And someone needs to tell this author that there is no such word as \\"ironical\\". How that got past editors and publishers I will never know!<br /><br />Still, this book is important history for understanding the roots of why our government is so out of control today -- it started then.

We want to understand them, perhaps in an effort to protect ourselves \\"next time\\". Given that, the Satanic aspect of Richard's story is also quite compelling. No connetion is made to other crimes of a \\"Satanic\\" nature in the same area at the same time, except perhaps at crimelibrary.com, where Katherine Ramsland, PhD suggests that Ramirez was influenced by the \\"Satanic Panic\\" at the time without necessarily being connected to the many crimes she then proceeds to list of a Satanic nature in that area at that time, yet stating that survivors of Satanic ritual abuse were unable to make their case due to \\"lack of evidence.\\" Pardon me. Ramirez was influenced by mass delusion? I think not.<br /><br />There is no connection to other Satanic crimes made in this book, nor probably in any others about the Night Stalker. How the author managed to describe what was going on in Ramirez' head as the crimes were described is beyond me, unless it is gleaned from conversations he had with the Stalker himself after the trial. What is the truth? What was left out? Will we ever know?<br /><br />Richard Ramirez was sentenced to death 19 times, and his death sentence is being held on appeal prior to his being tried for yet even more murders in San Francisco. He is, that is, still alive today. His victims, of course, are not.<br /><br />He is also one of those intriguing serial killers who are more than willing to die, to face the consequences of their crimes, not so much because he believes he's done wrong and has \\"found Jesus,\\" like many other ludicrous killers on death row, but because he believes what he did he did for Satan, who is waiting for him.<br /><br />But, \\"justice\\" being what it is, the man is still alive, and lived to find and marry a young, devoted, \\"Christian\\" virgin who dogged him along with a gaggle of groupies who fought over his visitation hours for years before, during and after the trial.<br /><br />He was supported, during the trial, by Anton LaVey and other High Satanists, who showed up in court on a regular basis. He is, indeed, attractive and mesmerizing, quite like a snake, I imagine, that you want to be able to master before he masters you. I, too, found myself strangely drawn to him -- but not enough to want to write to him, call him, or visit. If he wasn't connected prior to the murders, if he truly was working alone, I'm sure they are finding him quite useful now...and he's even more attractive now that the state has fixed his teeth, giving him a beautiful smile.<br /><br />Sneaking into people's bedrooms in the dead of night and killing them in their sleep, raping, shooting, stabbing, sodomizing and terrorizing men, women and children in a blind rage; the child of Mexican immigrants, American citizens who prayed fervently to Jesus while struggling with poverty and the ramifications of the nuclear testing at Los Alamos -- how much of this did we bring on ourselves?<br /><br />A fascinating look at the underside of American history.

The Vril Society established itself as a reaction to this book.<br /><br />The Vril Society (or the Luminous Lodge) combined the ideals of the Illuminati with Hindu Mysticism, Theosophy and the Quabbala. It was the first German nationalist group to use the swastika as an emblem linking Eastern and Western occultism. The Vril Society presented an idea of a subterranean matriarchal socialist utopia ruled by superior beings that had mastered the mysterious energy called the Vril Force.<br /><br />The Vril Society formed shortly before the Nazis came to power. They believed they had secret knowledge that would enable them to change their race and become the equals of men hidden in the bowels of the Earth through methods of concentration based in Ignatius Loyala's Spiritual Exercises.	2005-06-16

The police, assuming that, without evidence to the contrary, all missing children are runaways and running away from home is not a crime, refused to look. This is not uncommon. It was the same kind of problem John Walsh ran into and confronted when his son Adam went missing in 1981. It was a time before the Amber Alert, when only a desperate parent can know how crucial every minute can be. It was 1973-74  when the tortured, mutilated bodies were uncovered by police, led by David Brooks and Wayne Henley, alleged apprentices of the so called \\"Candy Man\\" Dean Corll, already murdered by Wayne Henley in \\"self-defense.\\" Apparently there aren't many books on these murders. Crimelibrary.com has a good section on Dean Corll. This book is well-written, and reading between the lines one can understand why there is such an outcry against homosexuality, if this is all one knows about homosexuality. Dean Corll is described as a \\"Pied Piper\\" who was always surrounded by kids, knowing how to relate to them on an emotional level better than he related to adults, and manipulating them with candy, drugs, alcohol, and sex. I suspect these crimes were far more about homophobia and the power it has within the closeted homosexual in a world where guilt and shame hold the cards. It's how perpetrators work. They learn all your secrets -- and then they use them against you.<br /><br />That said, this is a well-written book, a definite page-turner. I read it in 3 days. I am now obsessed with the story, which is far from tied up neatly. The two boys are serving time for their involvement based on confessions. There was no trial. The police dug up 27 bodies and then stopped looking, even though there are many more children unaccounted for and individuals who pleaded with the police to look in suspicious areas, only to be refused. The alleged \\"Candy Man serial killer\\" is dead, so he's not talking. Did the murders then stop? I doubt it. But the case is closed.dy Man serial killer\\" is dead, so he's not talking.

A well thought-out analysis that does not relegate Jonestown to a \\"bunch of stupid people\\" who \\"drank the Kool-Ade\\". What I particularly like about this book is the insight into \\"Human Relations Training\\" and its connection with brainwashing, a practice that was in the experimental stages just prior to Jonestown, and is very much a fine- tuned part of our culture today. Most of us are drinking the Kool-Ade and don't even know it. The author, in particular, exposes the non-voluntary nature of \\"voluntary\\" HRT, particularly in many workplaces. \\"Team Building\\" anyone? I've been there. I'm quite aware how it works. It's good to see it analyzed so thoughtfully in print.<br /><br />When Jonestown went down, this author is quite aware that it was no mass suicide -- no more than Waco was. People who were still in California were hiding from the assassins for years (Al and Jeannie Mills; not their real names). Some people were assassinated anyway -- and few people know that the connection is Jonestown (Dan White, Harvey Milk). The author runs his thread through a lot of Jewish organizations I don't know much about, particularly pointing the finger at B'nai B'rith, so I'll have to give him the benefit of the doubt there. That just tells me I have more reading to do.<br /><br />What troubled me about the book is its anti-Semitic slant. It's clear enough that the focus is on Zionism rather than Jews in general, but is troubling nevertheless. I've done enough research to know how right he is about most of what he says. I just wish there was another way to look at the troubling issues around Zionism and the role of Israel in the world today. It may very well be that there are political Zionists at the top of our pyramid. But Zionists are not always, and not even mostly, Jews. They like to hide behind the name, but they have been victimizing Jews for a long time and are good at it. (See review: \\"Hitler: Founder of Israel\\")<br /><br />They can't stay there unless we are all holding them up.lding them up.	2005-04-09

As history is explained and documented in this book, a lot of other things fall into place. I never did believe there was a homosexual holocaust, it just didn't make sense in the scheme of what I know about the Nazi motivation for a Master Race. They were far too self-centered to care about so-called \\"morality\\" -- and far too immoral, at that. That said, the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" apparently was a homosexual slaughter based on internalized homophobia (my words) and the self-centered narcissism of Hitler and his obsession for the preservation of his historical image. That, to me, makes sense, in its own perverted way.<br /><br />It is difficult to be clear about the difference between homosexuality and pederasty even today, and it certainly would have been difficult back then. Surely there was overlap, as there is today, particularly for gay men. Very few gay men are rapists, but there are clearly men who rape boys. Rape, however, is not the issue in this book. Power is. And, then again, rape is about power, isn't it?<br /><br />Given that, the Hitler Youth makes sense as well. Seduction, betrayal, secrets, power, and the Lebensborn homes, where women were nothing more -- nor less -- than breeders (again, based on my own research) speaks to me of a brilliant homosexual coup d'etat that makes \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" a monument to efficiency. After all, how can one control one's entourage without secrets?<br /><br />This is not about the gay \\"community.\\" There is no gay \\"community,\\" in fact, and there certainly wasn't one then. There was a sub-culture, as there always has been, but they did not then, and they do not now, speak with one voice. The oppression, narcissism and self-loathing they lived with, however, could definitely contribute to a perverse distortion of power and control and a terrorizing ab-reaction against the masses should someone of such proclivities actually make it to the apex.<br /><br />The anti-Semitism is a given, and had little to do with the homosexuality.

Once again I find this book paticularly compelling today, for obvious reasons. The pamphlets the White Rose students distributed (that they subsequently paid the ultimate price for) are reprinted in their entirety in the book. They are well written, beautiful in spirit, and as compelling today as they were then.<br /><br />The story is told with honor and reverence by the sister of Hans Scholl and Sophie Scholl, siblings and two of the students in Germany who brainstormed the pamphlets and were executed swiftly and denounced publicly for their trouble. In spite of that, or because of it, their efforts caused a ripple of resistance in the German republic that caused its fair share of trouble for the Nazi regime.<br /><br />Calling for a policy of passive resistance -- the ability for each one, individually, to sabotage any efforts of the fascist regime in power -- was a brilliant move on their part. No fundraising, no unending meetings, no need for mailing lists or computer databases. Sabotage rallies, sabotage in all areas of science and scolarship which further the continuation of the war, sabotage in all branches of the arts, and a refusal to give a penny to any government organized charity...such was the call of these noble individuals who had no great army, but who understood the power of the individual.<br /><br />I only learned of the White Rose within the past couple of years myself. Everyone should learn and understand what they did and why. It gives me hope.	2004-08-04

I suspect this is because it has been translated from German by someone who doesn't quite understand all the nuances of the English language. It doesn't help that amazon.com has a typo in the title. It is Adolf Hitler - FOUNDER of Israel: Israel in War with Jews.<br /><br /> That said, it is also a difficult read because of what it has to say. For this reason, it also becomes an essential read, especially today. This book was copyrighted in 1974. Here we are, in 2004, and Israel is as disruptive as ever. I do not, in this statement, equate Israel with Jews (which would render me anti-Semitic, which I am so not), although the confusion is understandable. It only becomes more confusing the more one tries to understand it. All Jews are not Zionists. All Zionists are not Jews. And some ZIonists were NaZIs.<br /><br /> The important point being, most of us have had the history of Israel taught to us in simplified fashion, a basic &quot;run through&quot; that supposedly suffices to tell us that we know &quot;enough&quot; about it to get through the day. Black and white, good and evil, perpetrators and victims.<br /><br /> Until, that is, we start having to send American (and other) sons and daughters to the Middle East to intervene in a long-standing an ongoing, historical battle that the history of Israel plays a significant part in. While this book can not address current times, it does address the roots in a way that allows us to understand better how history is unfolding as we speak. We cannot afford to limit our understanding of these issues to what the mass media chooses to tell us, or what we learn in the brief time that we are in school.

US	53064010	R1G94LTGGXCFFU	0340589787	125058369	Master Race	Books	5	9	9	N	N	An unending nightmare	This is an excellent book, well written, indexed, and thoroughly resesarched. A painstaking review of the history of the Nazi experiment whereby the &quot;science&quot; of Eugenics became manifest due to the &quot;fortuitous&quot; opportunity of WWII. The authors are clear that &quot;Lebensborn&quot; did not have its roots in Nazi Germany -- Eugenics was a worldwide movement that did not begin, nor end, in Nazi Germany. In fact, the best chapter is the last chapter.<br /><br /> In the conclusion, the case is made that those in favor of the &quot;scientific&quot; breeding of the human race are not, themselves, a dying breed. Those who were part of the project during the war had no problem finding powerful positions after the war, and their work does, indeed go on. The fact that it is, so to speak, &quot;hidden in plain sight&quot; is what makes it so dangerous. There needs to be more of a dialogue, a public consensus, as it were, that we know that this is happening, and an accountability for what is taking place. Decisions are being made by an elite few that may or may not benefit the human race as a whole. The fact that so few people know about it or have anything to say about it is what makes Lebensborn an unending nightmare for us all.	2004-08-03

My daughter was, though, when she was 3 years old and I was in labor with my son at the hospital. KISS's fans apparently ran the gamut and crossed all barriers, and that is to their credit. Of course, the ballad &quot;Beth&quot; was a beautiful piece of music -- but that's my style.<br /><br /> So why did I buy -- and read -- this book? Because I saw Gene on the Today show. I heard some of his beliefs about women and relationships. I found that intriguing. Here, I thought, was an intelligent man who didn't treat women like meat, who honored and respected their freedom, wasn't controlling or demanding. What made this man tick?<br /><br /> Uh oh. The flip side of that is that he *did* treat women like meat. He became a rock and roll star &quot;to chase skirt&quot;. He didn't drink or drug, but bedded every woman that crossed his path until he matured enough to comprehend what it meant to have a relationship with one. To his credit, however, jealousy and possession still do not manifest as part of his repertoire of behaviors -- at least, according to him.<br /><br /> With all the women he bedded, he never got an STD? AIDS is not a part of his story, he wasn't even affected by it? Even more incredulous, when the the woman he has been with for the past 18 years got pregnant, he was so shocked it made me wonder where he *thought* babies came from?<br /><br /> The poignant part of this story, though, is that his mother is a holocaust survivor who lost the entire rest of her family in the concentration camps. The only family they had was each other. From Israel, Chaim/Gene came to America, and the rest is history -- a history these Jews were not supposed to have. Gene has two beautiful children (pictures in the book) that were not supposed to be born. Gene Simmon's intelligence, his business acumen, his flair for marketing, and his eventual falling in love with fatherhood is a tribute to the survival of the spirit. Given the genetic memory of his roots, perhaps fatherhood *would* be a shock.<br /><br /> You survived in spite of all the bastards that tried to destroy you, Gene, and you did it with flair. God Bless America, and more power to you.<br /><br /> The other powerful message in the book has to do with Peter and Ace and the drug addiction that ensured that KISS, as successful as it was, would never reach its full potential because, &quot;while the band was conceived as a four-wheel-drive vehicle, we often had to drive on flat tires.&quot; Gene did not hate Ace and Peter. It is very frustrating to try to create success with co-workers who are too busy getting high to do their jobs, who don't show up, who argue about everything, and who have to consistently have replacements sit in for them. Drug addiction is no picnic for the user, but it's also no picnic for the people who have to put up with them. This is a powerful and important message that Gene does not dwell on. Clearly, he loved all the band members, or they would not have been part of the band as long as they were. The renegades were given more chances to redeem themselves than even most wife-batterers do, and the fans never knew...the ones that were too high to care, I suppose. That is to Gene's credit, I'm sure.<br /><br /> Drug abuse is the genocide of our lifetime and a workplace hazzard. Take this message to heart. Imagine what KISS could have been without the drug problems, if you can. More productive. More music, More shows. More tours. More fans. Even more money. And so could the rest of us be.<br /><br /> All in all, a fun book, a good read (Gene is a surprisingly good writer) and an interesting look behind the scenes.ry of his roots, perhaps fatherhood *would* be a shock.  <br />  <br /> You survived in spite of all the bastards that tried to destroy you, Gene, and you did it with flair.

David Harris speaks truth and uses words the way a surgeon or an artist uses their tools. Acknowledging that, as a country, &quot;we get what we do&quot; goes a long way toward answering the question, &quot;Why do they hate us?&quot; long before 9-11 ever became the symbol for &quot;What's wrong with this picture?&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;When a nation acts, all its citizens are joined insolubly in responsibility for the consequence of their national behavior.&quot; Truer words were never spoken.<br /><br /> &quot;While it may be an accurate conclusion, calling the war a mistake is the functional equivalent of calling water wet or dirt dirty. ... In this particular &quot;mistake,&quot; at least 3 million people died, only 58,000 of whom were Americans. These 3 million people died crushed in the mud, riddled with shrapnel, hurled out of helicopters, impaled on sharpened bamboo, obliterated in carpets of explosives dropped from bombers flying so high they could only be heard and never seen (talk about cowards!) they died reduced to chunks by one or more land mines, finished off by a round through the temple or a bayonet in the throat, consumed by sizzling phorphorous, burned alive with jellied gasoline, strung up by their thumbs, starved in cages, executed after watching their babies die, trapped on the barbed wire calling for their mothers. They died while trying to kill, they died while trying to kill no one, they died heroes, they died villains, they died at random, they died most often when someone who had no idea who they were killed them under the orders of someone who had even less idea than that. ... All 3 million died in pain, often so intense that death was a relief. This war was about us. We made it happen. It was ours. And, even at this late date, any genuine reckoning on our part must include assuming the full responsibility of that ownership. Nothing less will do.&quot;<br /><br /> So read David Harris's indictment of the Vietnam War. The more things change, the more they remain the same. This book should have received a Nobel Peace Price. It is a work of art, a labor of love.<br /><br /> Now, more than ever, it is important to read, and understand, what this author was trying to say.&quot;  <br />  <br /> So read David Harris's indictment of the Vietnam War.

This IS America, isn't it? It's well documented, and makes the case that the GOVERNMENT, NOT the United States, may very well be complicit in 9/11 -- by omission, if not co-mission. It makes a very clear case regarding who benefited from 9/11 -- and who continues to. These words are warnings we all need to hear -- and read.<br />One of the most interesting points is made regarding the illegality of the U.S. government activities these days, and how they fly in the face of the Constitution -- and how we all seem to be just looking the other way (particularly people who would warn you not to read this book!). States' rights have taken an especially painful hit as the Federal Government continues to expand to grotesque proportions, giving the lie to any &quot;Conservative&quot; stature the Republicans may claim.<br />My only complaint is that the book tends to repeat itself a lot -- which may need to happen to some extent to get these points across. Still, I had the feeling that it was written on a PC and the printout was never given a good final editing.<br />Just the same, it's important information, well researched and documented. No one has to believe it all -- but if you limit your information and news to the mass media, you deserve whatever you get.	2004-07-19

I attribute what troubles me to the obvious bias of the author, and yet -- it certainly made me think. Not so much as to how much of what the author says is true (and the rest of what he speculates); but how I feel about such speculation seeing the light of day. At the same time, I am not an advocate of censorship in any way. Perhaps these thoughts need to be available in order to make us aware of how people can make the erroneous connections about the gay movement that they do. I think a book like this does more harm than good. Homosexuality does not equal man/boy love. This author would suggest that it does.	2004-06-07

The author makes a fairly cogent point about the fact that most interpretations of Jonestown do not allow for the agency of the women involved with Jones and their power within the circle of power that organized and ran the organization in all three of its phases. That said, there is much that is left out, and I was disappointed because there is so much more research out there that is not even listed in her bibliography. Her history is lacking, too, in that she refers to the Unification church as the first media reference to concerns about cults and brainwashing, when in fact, the root of cult concerns goes back to Charles Manson and the media interpretation of what happened there -- particularly in references to his female followers. A major gap, in my humble opinion, that speaks to a lack of historical awareness on the part of the author.<br />Still, it's a very interesting book, and one that had me turning the pages fast enough that I was able to read the entire thing in one uninterrupted day. I learned much that was valuable in the sense of what the socialism of Jonestown stood for and why it was important, which leads me to some other areas of research. That's always exciting.<br />I would say it should be required reading for any serious scholar of Jonestown, but certainly not the final word.	2004-04-26

Women were at home, and they were at home for a reason. Even getting to church was a major endeavor, and one they fought for, for it was women who built many of the major American congregations thriving today.<br />Their relationships with each other sustained them, and also were likely to pose the most threat, for women could make or break the reputations of one another, upon which survival depended.<br />Childbirth, pre, post and in between, determined the rhythm of life for generations of women.

More importantly and to the point, what is it that we learn from our children?<br />If we are open to loving them unconditionally, we can learn a great deal. And there is much to learn from Glenn Milstead's mother's love, and from her own learning experience.<br />It's an odd relationship, to be sure, with years of estrangement and healing. In the fifties, children did not just &quot;come out&quot; in some youth group and attend regular summer Pride festivals. Mothers of the fifties did not have those kind of expectations -- and the sixties were a wake-up call all around.<br />But Frances loved her son, and struggled with her confusion. In spite of everything and anything he did that would cause more timid souls to faint dead away, Frances and Harris continued to lend Glenn money they would never see again, absorb credit card bills for exhorbitant expenses they had never approved, and support the lavish habits of a man they didn't understand.

It is unfortunate that the author is as scattered as she is, as it takes away from her credibility. That being said, there is much food for thought between the covers.<br />Her background in the Veda runs thickly through her musings, so it would probably be a good idea to read that first before tip-toeing through *these* pages. She parallels the descriptions of illness in the Veda with what she knows of radiation sickness. This is perhaps her most valuable contribution.<br />Her musings about gynic vs. andric women (basically, feminine vs. masculine women) and women's liberation being part of the downfall of mankind are bound to raise controversy. Some of it I agreed with, which only made the stuff I disagreed with that much more of a challenge for me to think about. But orgasm unhealthy? I think not. Exercise is dangerous, especially for women? Can this be true? READING is dangerous for women, *physically*? I, too, believe that women should take their roles as mothers far more seriously than they do today. I can't help but take issue, however, when a woman is saying this whose own priority is clearly her work (i.e. Phyllis Schlafly).<br />I was incredulous that this tome was submitted for a doctorate. There are bibliographical listings, but no footnotes whatsoever. Nothing that actually documents a word she says, except a lot of quoting from the Veda and some from the Old Testament -- which, properly footnoted, would have saved a lot of paper and left room for her own thoughts. If I wanted to read the Veda, I would have read the Veda.<br />Mandatory reading? Maybe not. Food for thought? For sure.	2004-02-18

Religious addiction is a stubborn malady, and one that can best be confronted by the addict him/herself. As one who has lost at least one sibling to this painful affliction, I wish it could have given me an easy answer. There are no easy answers to this dilemma.<br />One of the brightest conclusions Father Leo makes is that one need not give up religion, or God, to develop a healthy spirituality. It would be an incredible challenge indeed, but he assures those who are seeking that giving up God is not the solution to confronting religious addiction. He is very clear about the difference between &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;spirituality,&quot; something that is crucial in the healing process.<br />Father Leo also states that one can be addicted to atheism, and that atheism can be a religion in and of itself. Not necessarily that it is, but that it can become one.<br />The saddest and most frightening thing he points to is the inevitable outcome of mental breakdown if religious addiction is not treated. He outlines very carefully the possiblity of a loving intervention by those who are concerned for the addict, but when the addiction is religion (translated as &quot;God&quot; by the addict) denial comes way too easy and finding others willing to confront this denial is a very difficult challenge.<br />I was heartened to find that there is treatment for this addiction, there are places to turn. It is a relatively new field, but it gives me hope. I, too, wish there was acknowledgement of the harm this addiction does to the children of the addict -- but I don't know that I would put any state agency in charge of dealing with it.<br />One other concern that I have as I continue to study this subject is the subtlety of its intrusion into politics. When it comes to addiction, there IS no separation of church and state. In fact, this separation, if it exists at all, *only* exists for the state -- not for any church, unless it benefits *them*. They don't pay taxes, but they still find it perfectly acceptable to advocate for legislation from the pulpit and to lobby our representatives and to pass out post cards for the congregation to fill out in the middle of a service. It's a despicable practice, and one that becomes even more troublesome within the context of spiritual addiction.<br />Treatment for this malady has never been more important than it is today.ts for the state -- not for any church, unless it benefits *them*.

This book was a well-written page turner from beginning to end. The characters are believable and well drawn. Each plot twist left me wondering what was going to happen next, the true definition of a good story. For anyone who doesn't think the world described in the book is likely, I laugh...especially today.<br />Women in the book devise a language of their own, over the course of many years, that the men are totally oblivious to, and it changes the entire nature of who they are and how they relate to men in a way the men are entirely unaware of. What a concept!<br />Many feminists have spent their lifetime finding words for concepts that men were totally and stubbornly oblivious to -- &quot;rape&quot; and &quot;battered women&quot; being the most obvious. Mary Daly is one of the most brilliant strategists in the study of the roots of the English language and how it diminishes women in and of itself. Learning about that process is incredibly empowering, and should not be taken lightly.<br />Elgin takes that concept one evolutionary step further, and in the process makes the step creative, enjoyable and very, very fun.

The book is written primarily in novel format, as Horowitz's books tend to be. The mathematical exercises and language was over my head, but being familiar with Horowitz and his work, I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Even without the math, the book is a fascinating read. If one is into Scriptural codes, I'm sure it can only enhance the reading to ferret them out. I'm not quite sure that there were any *healing* codes, though. I'm sure I'll need to read the book again. What there were, were predictions about what is happening today, biologically, in front of our very eyes, that Sciptural codes describe and predict quite plainly. To me, it makes perfect sense, and is easy to pull together in times of apocalyptic thinking. Like most of Dr. Horowitz's books, this one raises more questions than it answers, and acknowledges it. Still, it's important to know the questions in order to properly search for the answers. If anyone can get us there, Dr. Leonard Horowitz can.	2003-10-21

This is an excellent book that gently and beautifully flies in the face of destructive stereotypes and any ill-conceived idea that the &quot;American Indian&quot; is powerless and extinct. Far from it. And for those who say the damage is &quot;all in the past&quot; and is not relevant today, this book also gives the lie to that mythology. Unfortunately, those aren't the people most likely to read this book. Given that, I would highly recommend making this book required reading in any literature course, history course, or humanities course in general. The writing is artful and succinct, the authors Pulitzer prize winners and accomplished in many other ways. What it means to be an Indian, Native American, in the United States of America while we are &quot;fighting to preserve our liberty&quot; is an incredible concept to wrap one's mind around. Stretch a little. These voices call out from history, through time, to the present to create the awareness that the world so desperately needs.	2003-10-01

I read \\"Nazi Terror\\" and \\"Hitler's Willing Executioners\\" for the same reason -- and while my thesis was validated in both, it was never addressed in either. To me, it doesn't matter why ordinary German citizens either participated in the oppression of the holocaust or looked the other way for anti-Semite reasons or not. It does not matter that they were German, even. Because they were alive at a time and place in history when one of the most horrific examples of mankind's cruelty to man took place, they are important to study -- not to place blame or find fault, but in terms of finding out how much like them we are. They weren't from another planet, after all, but this one -- and now, more than ever, we need to understand what happened then so we can recognize it when -- not if, but when -- it happens again. \\"Sure and the Patriot Act is not a threat to anyone if they've done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide\\" is no different than the thinking of those who looked the other way as long as the Gestapo weren't coming after them. If you don't think so...read this book. Too many of us, particularly as Americans, do not look too closely at our complicity in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, no less horrendous. Too many of us do not look too carefully at the treatment of slaves brought to America, or the continued attempted genocide of the American Indian. It's not that different. And it's time we started asking the questions that were not asked in Germany, that were not brought to the podium by those who had the obligation and the power to do so. Those who were not the targets of the Hitlerian Eugenics Mission -- but those who had been part of the science of Eugenics all along. People are disappearing in this country today in the name of terrorism, which no civil rights to determine whether they are guilty or not -- and no one dares to speak out. Those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it. We should be better than this in the 21st century. Have we learned nothing from the spilled blood of so many?ve we learned nothing from the spilled blood of so many?	2003-08-20

This is the book that documents and backs up a lot of the other information I have been sharing up to now... It may be difficult to create the hard evidence that would hold up in a court of law. Ritual and cult abuse are designed that way. The information does come together in a way that cannot be refuted by anyone capable of common sense. These things are happening, they are happening now, and they are getting worse. The only thing this book leaves out are the political connections of those involved. My web site and the links it includes does not. Be cautious. The information in this book is very triggering, and if you have any of it in your background or think you do there will be feelings. If you don't think you do, it will far easier, and safer, (for you anyway) to dismiss the entire thing out of hand. In the short run, that is.

If you get nothing else from these books, *get it* that the world is much bigger and much more complex than it seems, and all is not as it appears to be. If you are wondering why the world today seems unfathomable by our own limited forms of understanding, it is because of the undercurrents that we are not made privy to by those who are in control.

I have read a lot of books on being a survivor over the years, but this one tops them all. Sensitive and concise, with no agenda but the compassionate healing of the survivor, Aphrodite Matsakis is an impressive and knowledgeable author who will take you wherever you need to go gently, but clearly and firmly. Questions addressed include a clear definition of PTSD, its biochemistry, traumatic events, three levels of victimization, triggers, the healing process, and specific traumas: crimes committed by strangers, rape and sexual assault, domestic violence and sexual abuse, suicide of a loved one, natural catastrophes (like earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, fires), vehicular accidents, and war and combat.<br />Add to that the extensive list of resources in the appendices, and I can't think of a better place for a survivor to begin, continue or complete a journey through the recovery process.	2002-12-19

What is intriguing and important about this book is the awareness it adds to the ongoing saga of the man often called historically the \\"Angel of Death\\" of World War II. There is no need to reinvent the wheel in terms of Mengele's \\"work\\" in the concentration camps, there is plenty of literature that speaks to this quite plainly, clearly and specifically. His \\"work\\" is referred to, within its historical context, and within the framework of time.<br />What \\"Mengele: The Complete Story\\" attempts to explore with as much hindsight as is possible given its fairly recent copyright ((c)2000) is the nightmare of his existence as he lived out his life after the war. A nightmare, and yet, compared to the lives of the surviving Jews after the war, fairly privileged. He never did pay for his crimes, except, perhaps, for living with the fear for the rest of his life of being caught; and the disdain in which he was held by his own son.<br />It was interesting, and new information for me, to contemplate how this man's life and his hiding affected his family, and how they struggled with their loyalty to him as family while at the same time attempting to distance themselves from him in view of the harsh judgments of history. It could not have been easy.<br />Morality in war time is not the same as in peace time, which is often why war is declared...when an agenda exists that could never pass muster in peace time, war becomes the perfect manipulative tool for those in power to manipulate the masses.<br />The point being that Mengele was, indeed, doing what he believed to be his job, and to single him and other Nazis out as war criminals is to miss the entire point of what was going on, and is also to miss the entire point of what is going on today...and the entire point of war, itself.<br />If we continue to believe that it was them, that it was then, and that they are dead and it is over; we will never see what is happening under our very noses as an ongoing legacy of their work.<br />The Eugenics movement began in America and England, it was far bigger than Hitler and Mengele and Himmler and Hess and it was far bigger than Germany. The American Medical Association is no different in its medical experimentation now as it was then, and the AMA became particularly horrendous after the war BASED on the work the Nazis did in the concentration camps, imported via Operation Paperclip.<br />German medicine had a particular advantage in its scientific study because of the concentration camps that every country benefited from in terms of the slave labor and the medical experimentation that benefited NASA specifically in later years, as we clammored to learn how various conditions would affect astronauts in space. How much cold could they take, how long could they go without food and water, how long would it take them to die if, if, if...?<br />And how *do* we create a \\"Master Race\\" and rid ourselves of those \\"others\\" that take up so much air and space and give us so much trouble?<br />In war time, a certain percentage of people are going to die anyway, the thinking goes, so you might as well make the most of them while you can. Thus, the medical advances during the Civil War, World War I, and even Vietnam, where brainwashing and mind control took a particularly evil turn in terms of the tortures involved.<br />But if we keep looking at Hitler and Mengele and Himmler and Hess and wipe our brows with relief that \\"THAT is over!\\" we won't recognize the dangers we are in today. This book doesn't cover that -- but what it does raise is the question of how Mengele managed to survive so long without being found, right up until he died. Extremely convenient, if you ask me.<br />The authors have done extensive research and interviews, and pay particular attention to the mythology of Mengele and how reports of sightings were legendary, almost beyond human capability. The authors dismiss most of the sightings out of hand. I don't. The authors also don't seem to evenhint that Mengele's work may have continued anywhere else, as important as it was. I question that as well. There is no doubt in my mind that his influence is felt particularly today.<br />That said, this is an important book that brings the history of Mengele as up to date as any can right now. It is essential reading, I think, for those who are trying to stay on top of the Nazi legacy.<br />...geminiwalkern hint that Mengele's work may have continued anywhere else, as important as it was.

What makes the story even more fascinating is the way it is so well-written, you can see yourself in the characters and their total obliviousness to what is going on around them in the midst of their self-centered little dramas -- pretty much like what is going on today in the USA. If only we could all see beyond the next drama to the bigger picture.

Singular includes much information and speculation that doesn't make it into the mainstream press, but is, quite frankly, common knowledge regarding possible child-pornography connections to this gruesome and tragic event. While it is true that Singular raises more questions than he answers, the timing of the book (published in 1999) made that necessary. He had no answers, and the questions, at that time, were not being raised.<br />Now, as more and more children are disappearing off the streets, from in front of their homes and even from their own bedrooms, this book requires a second and third glance. There is far more going on here than meets the eye, and it has been going on for far too long.<br />JonBenet is a symbol for what is happening across America today, and she will not rest in peace until we know what happened and why, and until we know enough to put an end to it, once and for all.	2002-07-19

It was well read, well researched. I don't see it as having a bias, but a point, and a point well taken. Taken in context, Werner von Braun was no more and no less than a German, and a product of his times. He was a leader in his field in Germany, and in America. What stands out for me is what this book says about America and, in particular, the United States Army.<br />This book has the most thorough documentation of Project Paperclip that I have seen yet. While presenting as balanced a perception as possible about why certain things played out the way they did, it is indeed troublesome that the high-tech space industry was balanced on the backs of slave labor from its inception, and definitely seems to be moving even further in that direction today throughout corporate America and the New World Order. This is no accident.<br />Nor is Werner von Braun the ultimate Evil. He was a human being who was exploited as so many are and wanted only to do his best work. Germans were raised, through their educational system, to respect and obey authority without question. This, too, is where our public education system is trying to go.<br />I bought the book in particular for its chapter on his work with Disney. I was not disappointed. You won't be either.	2002-07-18

I have been researching the rise and fall of the Peoples' Temple since 1980, and Naipaul has written a documentation that is not only deep and probing but also prophetic.<br />The powerful were not manipulated -- they were complicit. This much I know, and they remain complicit. I know things today about the Temple that Naipaul did not. Still, Naipaul's rendering is as balanced as it is unbiased -- something you don't find very easily anymore.<br />While the racial aspect of what happened in Guyana is such an obvious factor, what is not clear is why. Naipaul has a theory as eloquent as it is powerful:<br />\\"The CIA killed them. America killed them. They had gone to the Guyanese jungle because they wanted to live a life free of racism, sexism and poverty. ... One can think of them (Blacks) as the human equivalent of the radioactive waste produced by nuclear power plants: sterile and potentially lethal. What, the ecologists ask, is one to do with this waste? Bury it miles underground? Shoot it into outer space? Discover some way of breaking it down and rendering it harmless? The junk people. The human waste left behind by American history, are no less negative, no less dangerous a quantity. One sees them on the streets of midtown Manhattan, carrying glittering noisemaking machines, dressed to kill, the ugliness and the hatred of the discarded slave glowing in their eyes. You see them in Harlem, standing drunk or drugged on street corners. What is to be done with them?\\"<br />What a concept. Not because of what or who they are ... but because of what we have made of them. The concept boggles the mind with it's clarity and coherence!<br />What is also true is that because the world believed they were all suicides (they were most assuredly not) no church would accept their bodies for burial. How can a travesty become any more horrendous, as the bodies bloated and leaked their toxic fluids in the tropical heat? Again, not something Naipaul was privy too, but I have learned since.<br />Further on, at the end, the book becomes even more prophetic in terms of where the concept of \\"mind control\\" took of from Jim Jones, validating theories that are unfolding as we speak. First copyrighted in 1980, it is amazing how clear his vision truly was.

Read this book and I'm sure you will say, out loud, in unison, with me -- I think not! Nothing has changed since that report hit the airwaves, the FBI continues to fly by the seat of its pants, making things up as it goes along, following orders in order to make sure the prisons are full of the candidates properly chosen by those it *is* accountable to...and it hasn't been accountable to the American people for a very long time.

It is boys as well as girls who are starved, beaten and abused within a patriarchal system as children, entirely dependent on women who have all the responsibility for their unpaid labor, and none of the power to make things right.<br />I loved the way the authors articulated the importance of the unpaid work women do, and how much our entire global economy depends on it.<br />This work is not only historical, it is current, prescient, and brilliant. It is crucial to our time, and should be mandated reading for everyone. If only we could make that happen!<br />&quot;Because the enemy does not exist in space, but in time; four thousand years ago. We are about to destroy each other and the world, because of profound mistakes made in Bronze Age patriarchal ontology -- mistakes about the nature of being, about the nature of human being in the world.&quot;<br />Touching on *quantum physics*, the authors create a spiral of hope that defies the statement that we are calling for a *return* to a time that no longer exists, but to a time that cannot be destroyed because it is organic and essential to the survival of this planet and the people She embraces.<br />I loved the author's use of words, too, she does not limit her vocabulary or &quot;talk down&quot; to her readers, but she does not talk over their heads either. She knows what she is talking about and it would behoove us all to listen.<br />After all, &quot;People who put in two-thirds of the world's working hours and receive in return one-tenth of the world's income should have something to say about the idea that hard work equals wealth. ... The bitter truth is, under four thousand years of patriarchal 'exploit-for-profit' economics, the women of the world have worked long and hard, often under the worst necrophilic conditions, to keep the human race minimally alive. In return, we receive mostly dismal statistics signifying not reward, but rip-off.&quot;<br />The only drawback of this book is that once you read it, once you *get* it, you will never be the same again. And if more people *don't* read it, those who *do* get it are going to be very lonely and hard to live with people. Evolution is a lonely path.

The more I learn, the more my skin crawls when I hear references to the &quot;vanishing Indian.&quot; If anything, it is even more evidence that our mainstream media is telling us what they want us to believe. Oh, it was a valiant effort made in the creation of &quot;the land of the free and the home of the Brave,&quot; but it was not successful. Attempted genocides are rarely, if ever, completely successful. For that, we can be grateful...but just barely.<br />From the book:<br />&quot;We, the Indigenous Peoples of this red quarter of Mother Earth, [have survived] 500 years of genocide, ethnocide, ecocide, racism, oppression, colonization and christianization. These excesses of western civilization resulted from contempt for Mother Earth and all our relations; contempt for women, elders, children and Native Peoples; and contempt for a future beyond the present human generation.&quot; (Taos, New Mexico, 1992)<br />Native Americans kept this country and the living forms within it pristine for thousands of years before it was &quot;discovered&quot; and &quot;civilized.&quot; In 200 years it has been desecrated, vandalized, poisoned almost beyond repair, in the guise of &quot;Manifest Destiny.&quot;<br />It's incredible to even consider &quot;Patriotism&quot; without considering the roots of its &quot;success.&quot; One Nation, &quot;Under God&quot;:<br />&quot;In New England, zealots such as Cotton Mather encouraged the Puritans to regard the Indian as a principal actor in the cosmic drama that governed even the smallest details of life, a 'spetial instrument of God' to punish errant souls in the eternal struggle between good and evil. In such a climate, killing Indians became not merely warfare but the cleansing of sin itself.' ... The degree of violence that was woven into the texture of early frontier life fairly boggles the mind of our, in some ways, far more delicate age. In the 1650s, Dutch colonists brought back eighty decapitated Indian heads from a massacre and used them as kickballs in the streets of New Amsterdam.&quot;<br />&quot;It was widely assumed by Americans that Indians were destined to vanish before the onrush of civilization, a view of things that conveniently allowed cynicism to blend with sentimentality...It was as if the Indians' disappearance were the result of some force completely beyond the human power to stay, like a tidal wave or a change of seasons.&quot;<br />The stories are horrendous, and should be required reading for anyone who claims to be a Patriot. This is not to say that Patriotism, in itself, is wrong. Not at all. Just that it should be an informed Patriotism, one that accepts responsibility for its history with an investment in a better and healthier future.<br />&quot;Between 1850 and 1859, the federal government reimbursed the State of California $924,259 for what was basically freelance murder. ...In April of 1852, miners at Orleans Bar, 'after meeting to discuss the Indian problem, voted to kill on site all Indians having guns,' a local newspaper reported without comment. The next month, near Weaverville, 153 Wintuns were slaughtered in reprisal for killing five cows that belonged to a white man. In 1853, at Yontoket, several hundred Tolowas were murdered in the midst of their harvest dance. A survivor described it, 'The whitemen built a huge fire and threw in our sacred ceremonial dresses, the regalia, and our feathers, and the flames grew higher. Then they threw in the babies, many of them were still alive.' ...Until the 1880s, California courts barred any kind of testimony from 'Indians, or persons having one-fourth or more Indian blood in an action in which a white person was a party.'&quot;<br />&quot;Professional slave hunters raided Indian villages with impunity, seizing women and children for sale to miners and to brothels in the gold rush towns. In the mid-1850s, a pubescent girl sold for about $300 and smaller children for as little as $50.&quot;<br />Yes, the roots of child sexual slavery go deep into our history.<br />But the book is more than horror stories and balanced history. There is a future here, and a challenge to the belief that the &quot;savage Indian&quot; has been wiped from the face of the earth. Historical guilt has its limitations, and that is not the purpose of the book. The history of Indian law under federal policy and Indian education opened my eyes to an expansion of Indian culture that I found heartening and exciting. &quot;More consistently than any other in the nation's history, Indian policy has embodied the nation's unending struggle to apply moral standards to the conduct of public policy.&quot;<br />America is not the only nation to attempt to wipe out indigenous tribes, and that is another course of study. The difference, in America, as the book points out, is that America continues to struggle with that history -- and that is something to get Patriotic about. It is a record that, though flawed, is unequaled by any other nation in its dealings with aboriginal peoples.<br />The book raised a question about tribal sovereignty that was new to me, and that I continue to struggle with long after having read the book. Does it move them forward, or hold them back? Would mainstreaming the American Indian be empowering? Or would it take from them what remaining culture they have left? That is the ultimate question of &quot;celebrating diversity&quot; vs. the &quot;melting pot&quot; theory of America. It is not limited to Indians. And it is a concept we must struggle with, perhaps to the point of redefining what it means to be &quot;mainstream&quot; in America.<br />Another concept that made me think was the lack of &quot;civil rights&quot; legislation under reservation law: free press, free speech, and separation of powers. If Federal Law is &quot;hands off&quot; reservation land, where to Indians find justice if their governments are corrupt? For that matter, where do we? Perhaps the question is not, who should have the power, but how do we as a nation challenge corruption?<br />&quot;What are the limits of federal powers? How can tribalism be squared with the legal and moral dictates of equal protection under the law? What is the role of the states in Indian Country and of the tribes in constitutional democracy? What is the civil juristiction of tribal courts? How can the United States support tribal regimes that reject fundamental aspects of American democracy? What is the basis for asserting that reservation Indians shall have representation in state government but without taxation? On the other hand, what is the basis for asserting that non-Indian residents of Indian Country shall not be represented in tribal government yet be subject to tribal law, courts, and taxation? How can we, as Americans, tolerate double standards?&quot;<br />Good questions, all of them. And Bordwich doesn't answer them. But he certainly gives us plenty with which to mull them over and discuss them. The important thing is that we not ignore them. The Indians aren't. And we are all in this together.sexual slavery go deep into our history.<br />But the book is more than horror stories and balanced history.

Vine Deloria is one very wise man. If you come to this book with preconceived ideas and stereotyped conceptions about Native Americans (as most of us do) you will no longer have them once you have opened your mind and your heart to what this man has to say.<br /><br />Deloria is well read, and this book is far more than I expected it to be.

Do we have any idea what we owe to the tribal peoples who populated &quot;America&quot; before it was &quot;discovered&quot; and &quot;settled&quot; and &quot;civilized&quot; by &quot;progress&quot;? What I knew before I read this book could fit on the head of a pin, and I already held great respect for the history I was aware of. Did you know that American silver probably did more to undermine Islamic power than did any other single factor? Did you know that the impact of American silver caused worldwide inflation that lasted for approximately a century and caused silver to fall to its lowest value in history? Did you know that the new wealth in the hands of Europeans eroded the wealth of all other countries in the world and allowed Europe to expand into an international market system? Did you know that because America now had all the silver and gold it needed, this destroyed the African gold markets, leaving Africa with only one commodity that the Europeans wanted: slaves?<br />From the book:<br />&quot;From silver and money capitalism to piracy, slavery and the birth of corporations, the food revolution, agricultural technology, the culinary revolution, drugs, architecture and urban planning our debt to the indigenous peoples of America is mind boggling. They mined the gold and silver that made capitalism possible. Working in the mines and mints and in the plantations with the African slaves, they started the industrial revolution that then spread to Europe and on around the world. They supplied the cotton, rubber, dyes, and related chemicals that fed this new system of production. They domesticated and developed the hundreds of varieties of corn, potatoes, cassava, and peanuts that now feed much of the world. They discovered the curative powers of quinine, the anesthetizing ability of coca, and the potency of a thousand other drugs with made possible modern medicine and pharmacology. The drugs together with their improved agriculture made possible the population explosion of the last several centuries. They developed and refined a form of democracy that has been haphazardly and inadequately adopted in many parts of the world. They were the true colonizers of America who cut the trails through the jungles and deserts, made the roads, and built the cities upon which modern America is based.&quot;<br />America owes a debt to slavery that can never be repaid. That's not to say it shouldn't be. At the very least, it should be acknowledged, validated, and honored with the respect that it deserves.xplosion of the last several centuries.

This is unfortunate. Olin's book &quot;Escape from Utopia&quot; is the best I have read on the subject. Olin was a participant in the Synanon Game and moved in to become a lifestyler. Utilizing the brutal honesty he learned playing &quot;The Game&quot; to its utmost, he writes this labor of love with as much clarity as he can bring to what seemed to be the promise of Utopia that burned and crashed in such a painfully devastating way. The book is even better when read from the perspective of so many years later, when the influence of Synanon can be seen in the drug rehabilitation movement even today without anyone even being aware of it. It raises lots of questions for someone like me.<br />This book is out of print, but if you can find it, it is a very important book.	2001-12-21

It won't teach you anything historic about brainwashing or mind control, and it was published in 1978, so ritual abuse is barely even a topic yet, but it will pull it all together so you can see a bigger picture, and perhaps what may be involved in confronting it.<br />The characters are well drawn, and the author is well versed in psychic subject matter, which is good in and of itself in order to add to the credibility of the story. It is well written, and the ending takes you to surprising places. All in all, an enjoyable read.	2001-12-19

What you will find will either turn you off or light a fire of curiosity that will burn with the intensity of Truth. This book is a good place to glean the basic concepts of Icke's philosophy, as Rappoport conducts the interview. Rappoport is an impressive author in his own right, which other reviewers didn't comment on for some reason. At a time when what passes for &quot;journalism&quot; in this country isn't worth the time it takes to turn on the TV, Rappoport asks the hard questions and does the dirty digging to get to the bottom of issues that we just don't look at hard enough. His willingness to give Icke credibility says a lot. Yes, Icke does some reaching, but we underestimate the potential of technology and its roots to our own detriment. Approach this book with an open mind, and don't make it the last one you read on the subject. Amazon.com will refer you to many other similar authors who have been investigating in the same vein. When you decide to stop seeking, it will be because you no longer want to know -- not because it isn't true. It's not a pretty picture, but it is only by looking at it clearly that we will be able to do anything about it at all.	2001-12-18

In the United States of America, in the land of the free and home of the brave, experiments were conducted that defy comprehension. Only by understanding the history of what motivates our leaders today can we begin to comprehend the chaos that surrounds us. Nothing is more important than the awareness that comes from turning OFF the TV, and turning ON our minds. Never has it been more important, a matter of life and death, to think for ourselves, to get off the treadmill of the expectations of others. Wells refers to the &quot;silent war of slavery&quot; that is being imposed upon us as we try to figure out what on earth the war we are being *sold* is all about. This book was published in 1998. It makes even more sense today.<br />Wells refers to MK-Ultra and the LSD experiments as well as kidnapped and missing children utilized in experiments under the guise of &quot;top secret national security.&quot; Don't let this go over your head. He is careful to say that our government, per se, is not responsible, but rogue elements within it that do not seem to be accountable to anyone. Only we can hold them accountable. But first we have to see what they are doing.<br />This book will allow you to open your eyes to the nightmare -- and the possibility of lucid dreaming -- before it is too late. In lucid dreaming, the dreamer realizes they are dreaming and is therefore able to take control of the dream. Becoming aware of the attempted nightmare that is being imposed on us in the name of &quot;freedom&quot; is a matter of life and death. We ignore it at our peril.	2001-12-13

This little book was published in 1977, when &quot;brainwashing&quot; was just coming into public awareness, and the potential of &quot;hypnotism&quot; was reaching its zenith. The topic created feelings of excitement and fear. In addition, there were those who chose to dismiss the entire subject as incredible, and those who formed their own misguided opinions while not bothering to learn anything about it.<br />The growth of &quot;human potential&quot; cults in the 60s and 70s brought brainwashing to the media, and an industry of &quot;deprogrammers&quot; kidnapped teenagers and young adults from self-styled communities in an attempt to &quot;save&quot; them. The young adults protested the violation of their civil liberties with the help of lawyers provided by their chosen communities. Whether or not they had been brainwashed became impossible to prove in the face of the denial, and who was going to control these vulnerable young people became a matter outside the realm of law.  While the issue of brainwashing and mind control could never be proven, it continued to be insinuated in various legal venues and in the media when it might appeal to the emotions of popular culture in support of or against a verdict, i.e. against Charles Manson, in support of Patty Hearst.<br />This book appeared at a time when the &quot;cults&quot; of the 60s and 70s were at their peak. It is a clear and documented explanation of how and why brainwashing works, its history, its dangers, and its potential benefits. I give it four stars because it is dated, but it is important history nonetheless.<br />Whatever benefits hypnotism may have can be attested to by, perhaps, the growing market in &quot;self-hypnosis&quot; self-help audiotapes and video cassettes. The dangers, however, at this point in time, have far outweighed the benefits, to the extent that the topic can hardly even be discussed, though never has it been more important. Therapists are so afraid of being accused of &quot;implanting false memories&quot; that hypnotism is not even being used as the tool is could be. Survivors of &quot;mind controlling ritual abuse cults&quot; have no place to go with their memories.<br />Repeatedly, in several places, the author clearly indicates that &quot;brainwashing has come to America.&quot; It is a call to reality, a demand to come to terms with what this means for our people, and our future.<br />At a time when schools and workplaces are no longer safe havens from suicidal mass murderers who never see a trial, when an unexplainable event like 9-11 leaves us, in terror, believing anything the mass media tells us about it and willing to do anything suggested in response, it is crucial to understand the phenomena of mass hypnosis and the dynamics of mind control. It is the only way we will ever be able to begin to see clearly how we are being manipulated.<br />This book is out of print. I am not selling mine. However, I see there is one used available.

I love the playful way he pokes fun at our most horrendous historical peaks because, after all, if you couldn't laugh you just might not be able to stop crying. He's fun, and a lot of people have had fun with him. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that hurts his credibility, and that hurts any vision of truth he may have. Still, I was so impressed by an online essay that came to an email list I'm on that I looked him up on amazon.com and found this book. I just know that what we need more of these days is the kind of underground press Krassner was an important part of in the 60s. I'm glad he's still around.

As volatile a subject as the &quot;Child Sexual Abuse War&quot; can be, he has managed to maintain an objective and unbiased look at the work thus far that can only help the effort to get to the truth and elucidate some kind of justice. He covers both sides of the issue in a way that allows you to make up your own mind, even if you don't agree with the person who read the book before or after you. It is factual and documented with an appendix in the back that will open doors of understanding you won't find anywhere else. The work is far from complete, but that is not the author's fault. The fault lies in a world that is trapped within the gridlock that the author describes. At least maybe by looking at it this clearly, we can do something about it. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the book is out of print. Buy it used. I don't know why anyone would sell it, but I see that they are. It's a treasure. Get it while you still can.	2001-12-10

It will be very useful for the next generation who wants to know every ad nauseum detail of the &quot;election&quot; we were all sick of by the time it was, as they say, &quot;over.&quot; By the time it was &quot;over,&quot; I didn't believe any of it. Not one word.<br />And that's Tapper's point, I suppose. The &quot;plot&quot; existed on both sides, and this is what politics has become. He also makes a powerful point at the very end about who is responsible -- if you can bear wading through the details to find it. In a democracy it is *we* the *voters* who are responsible for the debacle our &quot;democracy&quot; has become -- with our apathy and our greed and our out of balance priorities. Democracy is not a spectator sport. It requires heavy-duty participation, and those who benefit from our willingness to &quot;hand it over to the experts&quot; are those who could never, in any sense of the word, become Leaders.<br />What if we had *known*, during the election, that 9-11 would go down? Would we have been so willing to &quot;get it over with&quot; that we wouldn't care if the recounts were halted by fiat? Are we in such a hurry that we can rush through the most important decision in any democracy, and accept slipshod judicial decisions as History?<br />I suppose we are human, and in that, we are flawed. We stand convicted of our apathy, and we are paying a price for that now.

Most of us live in a prison of one kind or another, often of our own making. In a world where the U.S. prison industry has grown faster than any other, and the Constituion that protects our rights is in serious jeopardy, we never know where we are going to end up. Jarvis Jay Masters has pulled together a peaceful philosophy in the midst of one of our most violent subcultures, a philosophy that got him through each day, facing each challenge on the highest level he was able to master. I am impressed with his effort to better himself, and I think we can all benefit from his example. Masters is able to find freedom where there might appear to be none. So can we all.	2001-11-14

As we sit with our eyes glued to the coverage of the &quot;War&quot; in Afghanistan, it is crucial that we observe the mainstream media with the awareness of how many years they have manipulated, lied, and deceived the American people. We cannot have a true democracy, we cannot make informed choices, we cannot live authentic lives when so much crucial information is kept from us because we don't, for whatever reason, &quot;deserve&quot; to know. Now, more than ever, it's important to realize the importance of alternative news outlets, and the most important part of this book is that it lists them -- all of them -- so you can find them all. Don't limit yourself to the New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today, The Enquirer, and ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN. There's a whole world out there that so far has not entirely been kept from us -- but you have to work to access it. It's well worth the effort, and the rest of us out here digging stuff up could really use your help! Welcome aboard!	2001-11-13

Perhaps not surprisingly, Synanon is one of the many controversial organizations that wove its way through the 60s, becoming a commune, then developing a &quot;cultish&quot; reputation while at the same time becoming a powerful influence in Corporate America. How odd. It's a good history of the program, and is important reading for that reason alone. I read it to try to understand and come to grips with my own history in a &quot;drug program&quot; that apparently had its roots in this one. I understand a lot more about myself and the influence of the program on me now that I've read this book. It's tragic, I think, that we leave the most desperate of our citizens at the mercy of people who exploit them mercilessly because we don't know what else to do, and basically, we just don't care. We can do better than this, but only if we understand the roots of the dysfunction of our &quot;rehab&quot; system. It only compounds the dysfunction of addiction. For a balanced interpretation, also read &quot;When Society Becomes an Addict&quot; by Anne Wilson Schaef.<br />&quot;The Rise and Fall of Synanon: A California Utopia&quot; is a valiant effort at responsible reportage with many years of hindsight. I would not overlook its importance.	2001-11-13

Those familiar with the concept of the Nephilim, the &quot;giants&quot; referred to in the old testament, will be impressed with Marzulli's thoroughly researched efforts in telling a magnificent story. Those familiar with von Daniken's &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot; will not be surprised by the interweaving thread of historic extraterrestrial genetic interbreeding. Again, well researched, well told.<br />I thought the book took a rather lazy, predictable turn toward the end, but I enjoyed the excellent read up to that point. It makes me wonder if the editor told the writer to change something at the end that probably hurt the original concept. It would be unfortunate if that were the case, and I would hope that all writers would take a lesson from what, I admit, is a theory, and hold on to your own treasures. Your readers will appreciate it. What *can* happen is that, once you have read the thoroughly well written novel up to the end, you can devise an ending that makes more sense to you. It would even make a good &quot;game&quot; for a book readers' group, or an email list. Shoot, maybe I'll even give it a shot. It's a great book. If you're into this sort of thing, I highly recommend it. It is as current as it is historical, and touches on events you are reading in the newspaper today -- even though the book was written before they happened.	2001-11-07

This book makes that clear. This book is about a lot more than Barry Seal, and for further discussion of what this book IS about, you can join the email list CIA_DRUGS@yahoogroups.com<br />This book covers a span of time that begins pretty much with the cold war, but it's really the root of a lot of stuff that is going on today. Barry Seal was dealing drugs for George Bush. Barry Seal was involved with Iran-Contra. Barry Seal's assassination was ordered by Oliver North. Running drugs in and through this country has financed covert operations that would be beyond imagination if they weren't all too true. If your family has been torched by the scourge of drug addiction (as too many families have been) you can not afford to turn away from this horrendous truth. Even more, it is no small detail that Afghanistan is known for its opium production. It's important to know this, and to learn as much as possible about it. Even more important is to work together to figure out what on earth we are going to DO about it -- beside \\"Pledging Allegiance to the Flag.\\" There's a lot more to this flag than flying it -- and a lot more to democracy than voting. We're losing our freedoms, we're losing our country, and we are losing our lives to a conspiracy that is a lot more than a theory. Read this book. Than read the rest of my reviews. Do your own reading. Maybe we can figure out what to do before it's too late. With liberty, and justice, for ALL.<br />My only criticism is that the book could have been more readable. I wasn't crazy about the style of the language, but maybe that's just the style of the investigator (Hopsicker) in the work that he was doing. It's not my style. That doesn't make it a bad thing, just a little harder for me to follow, that's all. Hopsicker is a prolific and readable poster on the CIA_DRUGS list, and shares a great deal that is useful, so believe me, I don't hold his particular style against him. I just wish it were more readable for the general public, so that more people could be made aware. If you like James Bond type reading, though, or know someone who does, those are the people to target with this book.

While the numbers were a bit over my head, I appreciate having them there, and the scientific effort that went into putting this information out there. I have great respect for the author Erik von Daniken (Chariots of the Gods, etc.) and find this book a more scientific backup to von Daniken's philosphical and historical point of view.

Most people don't even think about Rwanda because it happened outside America, and we Americans think that things like that can't happen here. How terribly wrong we have been! It is crucially important, I think, particularly at this point, to learn about war and attrocities that other countries have had to live with on their shores, much longer than we have. I'm sure Americans have much to learn from those who have struggled daily with the violence in their midst. We have our share of crime to live with, and our &quot;War on Drugs,&quot; which is another story entirely, but genocide is truly not far from our reality at all. We just need to open our eyes and be aware of it. Too many people think the only attempted genocide that ever happened was the Holocaust, and perhaps the Armenian genocide. There have been so many others, including the attempted genocide of the indigenous Native American. Here is a colorful and powerful eye witness account of one man's journey to tell the story of the genocide in Rwanda. The images of body parts cluttering the journey are sharp pointers to the body parts that today litter the streets of New York City. Though genocide was not the aim (or was it? was the death of all Americans really the ultimate goal here? for me, the jury is still out on that one), still, the images are similar and distressing. Read this book. Then, listen to some cheerful music and read something uplifting before trying something else as challenging.	2001-09-20

Even the appendices in the back are shoddy. If the newspaper actually wrote the articles the way they are reproduced, it says sad things about the Worcester Telegram & Gazette in the 1800s! I can't make head nor tails out of what the authors are trying to say, and the way they try to say it makes it even worse. Based on a true story, the historical murder victims must be spinning in their graves! If the murders themsevles were tragic, the writing of this book is even moreso. How a publisher could even put this book on the shelves in the shape it is in is beyond me.	2001-08-23

You could have knocked me over with a feather at the intensity of my feelings when my son was born. The oldest of seven siblings, I had never had such feelings for my brothers. I had been much closer to my sisters. My own firstborn was a daughter, and I love her dearly. But there was something about the way my son seemed to adore me that creeped into my heart and made him so very, very special, in spite of my &quot;feminism&quot; and my need to rage, rage against the Patriarchy. In fact, it was the Patriarchy itself that put him most at risk, and one I did not want him to become a part of, if I could help it.<br />Nor did I want to become the kind of mother who emasculated her son. His father was out of the picture, for our own safety. I did not want him to grow up like so many of the men I saw around me. I wanted him to discover and unfold whoever he really was, and I wanted him to be happy with that.<br />Now, he is 24 years old, and we are so close it scares us sometimes. I wonder if I was wrong, and he assures me that though it was difficult, he's sure that I was right. He can make me laugh with his magnificent insight into my soul, he sees things about me that no one else can see ... and sometimes, I swear he doesn't see me at all, even though he's sure he does. And then there is that terrible awkwardness when we push each other away because neither one of us wants to suffocate the other...<br />Such is the beauty of this book. Written from the point of view of a loving and devoted son, I now have a much clearer sense of the cautious territory in which I am privileged to tread. Written like the true love story that it is, Weinstock puts words together so beautifully (with the help of his mom ;-) that I no longer feel like I am walking blindly into a mine field. I understand the rhyme and reason of this madness that pulls us together while it keeps us apart, and I have a clearer sense of what to expect. I may not agree with everything the man says about the inevitable definition of what it means to be a man, but I can respect it, because if I cannot respect the man's point of view, I have no business mothering a son at all. It's been a tightrope walk from the beginning. Thanks to the awesome gift of this author, I am no longer walking on eggs.itable definition of what it means to be a man, but I can respect it, because if I cannot respect the man's point of view, I have no business mothering a son at all.

Land of the free, and home of the brave? After this last election, do you still think we live in a Democracy where government is run with the consent of the governed? Read this book and you will see just how far back Amerikan fascism's roots are seeded. As touched on in my review of the book Acid Dreams, Colin Ross goes deeper and into the legitimate documentation of experiments by doctors, via Paperclip and other organizational efforts, to create mind controlled Manchurian candidates in this country. Just taking a cursory walk through history in the past 30 years will show you how much things have changed. We wonder why. Just the way things are? Overpopulation? Why is it that we have mass murderers in the high schools in our midst? Ross does not allude to these incidences, but he does take a good hard look at Patty Hearst, Sirhan Sirhan and Mark David Chapman utilizing FOIA documentation that certainly makes *me* take a good look at the ongoing insanity in our current day. These things did and do continue to happen. Riveting is the history of Linda MacDonald, a &quot;patient&quot; of Dr. Ewen Cameron at the Allain Memorial Institute in Canada, whose mind was entirely wiped out by LSD and electroshock and then re-wired with taped loops run under her pillow over and over and over as she &quot;slept.&quot; She emerged an emotional &quot;infant,&quot; who had to invent all over again who she was. This was his &quot;treatment&quot; for what we know today as post-partum depression. You can learn more about this case in the Mind Control video available through the History channel. Ewen Cameron, by the way, was the psychiatrist that &quot;counseled&quot; the Nazi prisoners at the Nuremburg trials. His work was not limited to Canada, either. How nice for him, that he was able to make his &quot;career&quot; on the backs of unwitting human guinea pigs!<br />Ross has an entire diagram of the MK-ULTRA projects and sub-projects, where they were, who ran them and where the funding came from. What an eye opener that is! There are buildings in my town named after Estabrooks and Hoaglund, &quot;doctors&quot; who were instrumental in the mind control projects pointed out by Dr. Ross.

In 1969, the year of Woodstock, I was 16 years old. Acid Dreams actually takes us back, back, much further to the beginnings of the LSD phenomenon in America in the fifties, through the turbulent sixties, and beyond. I was completely mesmerized by energy and enthusiasm Lee injects into his prose. The history of the Baby Boom generation is not one to be dismissed lightly, as many try to do, especially those in positions of corporate power who would rather forget that &quot;tune in, turn on, drop out,&quot; meant a diversion *away* from the great American past time...shopping, consumerism, and corporate profit! If you aren't old enough to remember these times, and if you didn't learn about them in school (and I'll just bet you didn't!) this book should be mandatory reading in every high school! Because it condones and encourages the use of drugs? NO! Because it encourages critical thinking, questioning authority, and looking long and hard at the &quot;war against drugs,&quot; which is nothing more, and nothing less, than a war for the *control* of who is going to make the money off them. That's not what LSD was about when it got away from the Government...for it was the Government that first brought LSD to these shores in an effort to control people to begin with. It flew in their faces as they watched the younger generation make it their own flight to freedom. The psychotic breakdowns of bad trips were largely scare tactics designed to put control back in the hands of the &quot;experts&quot; who originally &quot;tabbed&quot; thousands of people in this country without their knowledge and/or consent, which, with LSD, *creates* the paranoia of the &quot;bad trip.&quot; With LSD, awareness and environment and the people you are with mean everything in terms of how it affects your ability to perceive the possibilities within you. Yes, I took LSD back then. I treated it with respect and when I had the time and the support to know I was safe. After reading this book, I am sad that it took the political turns it did, for it had so much potential, particularly in the therapeutic setting, where many doctors and patients found it mutually beneficial. If you didn't know that, that's just one reason of many to read this book! While I wasn't part of the core of the &quot;revolutionary movement&quot; of the sixties, I was aware enough to know that we *had* something, something *important* that needed to be said and heard, and in a desperate grasp to get a handle on it, I found the sweet taste of it in Acid Dreams.

I did find the title a tad misleading. I thought the book was a theory about what the agenda of the Aliens might be. Instead, I was treated to the agenda of the government in keeping historical and current information about extraterrestrial visitations from us, the people. Information that has not made it into the mainstream mass media is ferretted out in a way that is realistic, documented and makes sense. A final question is asked: if we *do* have visitors who want us to &quot;take them to our leader,&quot; just who would that leader be? What does he or she represent? And what are the priorities in representing Earth? The possibilities are intriguing, to say the least, and leave the reader with many questions that remain to be answered with nothing more, and nothing less, than serious contemplation by each and every one of us.	2001-07-17

Admittedly, I am a reader who gravitates toward alternative books, those who don't quite make it to the popular mainstream. Thus, my late acquaintance of Mr. Koontz. Silly me. Once again I am reverting to my quaint habit of listening to audio books as I weed in my garden. I started this one last summer, summer ended, as did the weeding, and I put it away, unfinished. I picked it up again first thing this summer, and started over, delightedly reminded of the intrigue that had held me quite rapt last summer. I didn't mind starting at the beginning again at all.<br />Now, what intrigues me about this book is how believable it is, and how it dovetails so nicely with the poli-sci reading that I *do* do. It's more realistic than you might think. More horrendous than you would want to think realistic. Koontz knows something, and he's telling it the only way he thinks he can get it across. For those who dismiss what he has to say as pure fiction, well, do your homework.<br />Even more than that, though, is Koontz's delightful way of turning a phrase, painting a picture with his words, making knowledgeable references to time and place and culture that most, if not all of us can relate to. More than once I smiled and even giggled as he captured an image with a brilliant metaphor. The man is good. He's very good. And yes, I'll read more by him.<br />The point I want to make, though, is that if you are in the habit of following my reading and my reviews, this one fits right in.

This book puts that lie to rest once and for all. I wish I had known there was a more current version of the book when I ordered this one (there is), but this particular version served its purpose for me. While the book itself does not address ritual/cult abuse specifically, it captures the essence of casework and history that involves more cannibal killers than I really wanted to know about.

I knew so little about Gary Hart before picking up this book, and now I see why the media was pulled into the effort to discredit him the way they were. What he has to say is important, powerful, and threatening to the status quo, the powers that be, and those who benefit from the long-standing Standing Army that is far larger and far more removed from the citizen than is healthy for us as a nation. I bought the book because of the title and my growing interest in the &quot;militia&quot; movement. My interest in the &quot;militia&quot; movement comes from my background as an army brat, closer to the military than many people. I am aware of how big the military is. I spent my life as a young adult struggling with poverty as a single mother, and I learned how much money goes into &quot;defense&quot; as opposed to how much goes into the social services that we so desperately needed. And I had to ask myself, with all the money that goes into defense, why are women and children so unsafe? Why are we so at risk? Why are domestic violence and child abuse such a major epidemic in this country, when so much of our tax money goes into defense? There's a lie in this double-think somewhere, and I think I'm beginning to understand what and where it is.<br />Gary Hart's vision takes us to a place where we can be joined together as a nation again, as a community of families that is truly invested in our own defense, in our own protection, and not in the protection of corporate raiders who care nothing for the individuals who make up this nation. It is not about the priorities of Employers, but the priorities of the people of this country, who are supposed to be the real leaders in a democracy. More people need to read this book. And they need to read it fast. It's almost too late already. The standing army that plays the tune we dance to is a growing menace to anything we think we still believe in. I wish I had the chance to vote for Gary Hart today.<br />&quot;We should undertake military reform while the economy is growing and we are at peace -- 'fix the roof while the sun is shining' -- by replacing much of our permanent standing military with well-trained and well-equipped National Guard and reserve forces, a national militia.&quot;<br />What a brilliant idea. There would have been no Vietnam. That, in itself, is testament to its brilliance.&quot;We should undertake military reform while the economy is growing and we are at peace -- 'fix the roof while the sun is shining' -- by replacing much of our permanent standing military with well-trained and well-equipped National Guard and reserve forces, a national militia.&quot;<br />What a brilliant idea.

This book is a perfect analysis of what turns &quot;ordinary human beings&quot; into psycho-pathological killers: bureaucracy. I read this book primarily to find the bridge between the medical experimentation that took place in Nazi Germany, and the medical experimentation that is taking place today, under our very noses. Yes indeed,*The Beast Awakens* is a good book to precede or follow this one in order to get the message that I almost think Lifton *wants* us to get: &quot;Genocide is a potential act of any nation.&quot; Those who do not learn from history, as they say, are condemned to repeat it.<br />It is not bureaucracy alone that is at fault in Nazi Germany, Lifton contends. Careerism, autocracy, authority, the seeking for glory in medical history at the expense of human guinea pigs, and the unwillingness to ask the important questions hold us all accountable for our behavior when we are asked to compromise our most cherished values, those which make us human, when we are called to choose the path of evil.<br />When we are asked to drop a bomb, or shoot the &quot;enemy,&quot; or plant a mine; when we are asked to maintain a subsistance wage structure that contributes to the oppression of those who are considered &quot;less worthy,&quot; (life unworthy of life), when we are ordered to withhold the truth from the citizens of our country because our &quot;government&quot; thinks we couldn't &quot;handle&quot; it, and when we do as we are told because it's &quot;just the way it is,&quot; we must accept responsibility for those choices, for choices they are.<br />&quot;In light of the recent record of professionals engaged in mass killing,&quot; says the author, &quot;can this be the century of doubling?&quot; Doubling, says Lifton, is the psychological ability to separate your &quot;human&quot; self from your &quot;shadow&quot; self so that you can do what you have to do and remain able to connect with your family and live your life. How close is that to maintaining a &quot;professional&quot; facade that allows a doctor to perform surgery by cutting into another human being's body while maintaining an &quot;objectivity&quot; that makes that possible (in the possitive sense), or a major corporation executive to pollute the nearby water that causes cancer in infants while still being able to face his children as they graduate from expensive Ivy League colleges? &quot;That wasn't me,&quot; the thinking goes, &quot;It's just my job. It's just what I had to do to make a living.&quot;<br />&quot;We thus find ourselves,&quot; says Lifton, &quot;returning to the recognition that most of what Nazi doctors did would be within the potential capability -- at least under certain conditions -- of most doctors and of most people.&quot; We have to look at this. We have to know it. To not look, to not know, is to have it happen again, all over again, and to not even see it coming.<br />&quot;If there is any truth to the psychological and moral judgments we make about the specific and unique characteristics of Nazi mass murder, we are bound to derive from them principles that apply more widely -- principles that speak to the extraordinary threat and potential for self-annihilation that now haunt mankind.&quot;<br />Lifton focuses a lot on the psychological concept of &quot;doubling&quot; as it applies to the Nazis ability to do what had to be done in the &quot;Auschwitz&quot; context of life as the Nazis lived it. &quot;The Auschwitz self could then become an absolute creature of context, and there is no better way to abnegate moral responsibility of any kind.&quot; Dissociation is another word for it. It's nothing knew. And it's not an excuse. It may be an explanation, but it is not an excuse.<br />Killing to heal is another interesting concept that Lifton explores, and one that factors even more ironically into current controversies: &quot;We had to destroy the village to save it,&quot; for example. The AIDS dissident point of view is another item that may easily be seen through the lens of Lifton's book, though he never does refer to it. Even more interesting is the comparison to war: &quot;War is the only accepted institution...in which there is a parallel healing-killing paradox. One has to kill the enemy in order to preserve -- to &quot;heal&quot; -- one's people, one's military unit, oneself.<br />We have got to get beyond that kind of thinking if we are going to survive to inherit this beautiful Earth we barely deserve anymore. Lifton knows it, and he knows why. So do I. If you read his book (and the others I've reviewed), you will know why too.<br />In discussing Eduard Wirths' brother Helmut, who had advised his brother to stay at Auschwitz in order to do whatever good he could there, Lifton says that had he(Helmut)been older and wiser, Helmut states he would have been able to take &quot;an unconditional stance against these events,&quot; for he had come to the conviction that &quot;the only thing to do in a situation like that is to say, &quot;No, I won't do it.&quot;<br />Wiser words were never spoken. We don't need to be cogs in the wheel of destruction. Break free. In the 60s, we used to say, &quot;What if they gave a war and nobody came?&quot; In fits and starts, that mantra has played out in small ways over time. It can come into its own today. Don't accept the slippery slope of small compromises. When you read this book, you will know that there is no way out once you start compromising what you stand for, and the human race, every one of us, will pay the price in the long run. When we stand up for dignity, freedom and justice, we all benefit. And remember...the whole world's watching.ther item that may easily be seen through the lens of Lifton's book, though he never does refer to it.

It's volatile, it's important, and there are still too many people who don't know anything about it at all.<br />The most crucial aspect of this book and the clearest documentation I have yet to find, regards OPERATION PAPERCLIP and the birth of CIA generated projects MK-ULTRA and BLUEBIRD. While this is only the tip of the iceberg of what the CIA has done and is doing to this country, it is imperative that people understand this part of the story in order to believe any of the rest of it.  To that end, Whiteout is one of the most important books in my library.

The narrative point of view is annoying, distracting and unnecessary. Horowitz also appears to get distracted by the discovery of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Janet Reno's effort to revamp the entire human services industry in Florida (prior to the Clinton presidency) without really pulling it all together in terms of how this affects the corruption of the AIDS industry. I'm sure there is an overlap, but I wish he had spelled it out more effectively. At the end, he gets into this annoying political diatribe about Clintonian politics and liberal values and a &quot;back to basics&quot; family values solution that made me wonder if he was born before Clinton was president. Or is he simply too privileged to realize that human services was just as horrendous to parents prior to Clinton? Or perhaps that was before it was fathers that were targeted, when it was okay to target single mothers? All these things are beside the point, and totally get away from the most important things that are said mostly in the first third of the book. For that alone, this book is a crucial aspect of dissident reading. It is just unfortunate that his obvious conservative bias takes away from the truth that all Americans, conservative and liberal, need to know if we are going to survive this outrageous holocaust.	2001-03-09
US	53064010	R3M8JWDKN375LE	0312034520	361875318	Who Killed John Lennon?	Books	5	43	48	N	Y	There is hope in speaking truth to power	John Lennon's death never DID make sense to me outside of the context of some kind of conspiracy. When he died, I was 27 years old. I had lived through the trauma of JFK's, RFK's and MLK's assassinations. I did not believe they were lone nut killings either, they were too important, and the question &quot;who benefits?&quot; usually leads to an obvious motive and an obvious suspect, even if it can't be proven. Once he was dead, I understood that John Lennon was the last hope of a dying spirit, the spirit of the 60s, the hope of a generation that had dreamed of creating a world of freedom, love and non-violence. That, to me, was the motive of a generation unwilling to pass the torch of life onto the next generation, the very baby boom they had created at the end of WWII to expand their own egos, yet were unwilling to acknowledge as having minds of their own and perhaps valid resentments having grown up with the values of a war torn parentage. This book dovetails nicely with the other books I have read and reviewed (see more about me) and the evidence is startling and massive to validate Bresler's theory that Chapman was, indeed, a mind controlled killer. The fact is, the CIA's shenanigans go far beyond MK-ULTRA, and have not stopped yet. They are gathering power as you read this, and looking the other way will not stop them. I'm not sure what will, but letting anyone else do your thinking for you won't. Learn as much as you can and know your own mind. Question authority, as the mantra from the 60s challenged, and do not allow the dreams and visions of the flower children to be silenced. They are not dead. They did take root. The toxic poison that surrounds us all is a deadly threat, but as long as we are open to learning and knowing and speaking truth to power, there is hope.	2001-02-12

This change demands the accountability of Truth in our lives. Greg Braden shares a philosophy about the current paradigm shift we are moving through. He explains how we can embrace and move through the changes in creative and empowering ways. His words make sense, and combine science and spirit in a way that is surprisingly refreshing. I love the way he thinks and he provides hope and inspiration during a time often filled with confusion and despair. I've seen (and own) his video series &quot;Walking Between the Worlds&quot; and it was this presentation that made me want to know more about Greg and the way he thinks. I need his words in my life, and I know I will be reading more of them. &quot;Those that claim to choose peace, prosperity, health and vitality for their world must first become those attributes themselves.&quot; Truer words were never spoken, they are the true spirit of healing the planet we all share.	2001-02-01

The horror of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study was that there truly was no evil intent on the part of the doctors involved, and all believed that the &quot;patients&quot; truly benefitted, receiving health care they otherwise would not have received for other ailments that they could not have afforded treatment for otherwise. In fact, the Tuskegee &quot;patients&quot; received health care for aches and pains that neither their neighbors nor even their wives and children were able to access, because of their &quot;privileged&quot; status as part of the &quot;government study.&quot; Placing the story squarely in the context of its time, Jones does not excuse those who bear the responsibility for the choices they made regarding the men involved in the study, but attempts to explain to the best of his ability why those in authority made the decisions they made, even to the point of placing a black nurse in the pivotal position of overseeing the consistency of the study and maintaining contact with the study &quot;subjects&quot; while the doctors themselves were rotated every year as part of their own &quot;educational&quot; history. Even Tuskegee itself was run by black doctors who chose to look the other way when they knew, had to know, the detrimental decisions that were being made. That is how power works. That is how it worked then, and that is how it works today. Is it because of Tuskegee that the Public Health System lacks credibility? Or is it because of the ongoing and persistent ignorance and incompetence of the Public Health System itself? The system is infested with politics, funding fiascos and unethical practices. It didn't start with Tuskegee, and it certainly didn't end there. This is a very important part of the story, and should be mandated reading for anyone who wants to understand the controverted manipulations of the Public Health System. It is only the beginning, however. Don't stop there.	2001-01-30

Most of the information comes out of the author's own experience working with children who had experienced what she describes as psychic trauma. Primarily her subjects are the children of the Chowchilla kidnapping that took place in 1976, but there are other children that she refers to as well. While her work is important and interesting, it is certainly not the last word in trauma research. I was particularly distressed by her tendency to dismiss and invalidate the children themselves while imposing her own interpretations of their experiences on the very children she was researching. Questioning a child's ability to remember their own reality is very problematic for me, and stating as a fact a great many things that she does not document made me wonder what on earth her agenda was. She tended to alienate her subjects with her inability to believe the things they shared with her in trust and confidence, and I suspect that she lost a great deal of valuable understanding in the process. As I said, I enjoyed reading the book and I'm sure it will be a valuable addition to my reference shelf, but I do take issue with her bias and her own interpretations of experience she herself did not face. It is for this reason that I will keep her nearby as I continue my own research and understanding of trauma and recovery.	2001-01-30

While there continue to be nay sayers to this day who deny that PTSD even exists, Herman makes the case that PTSD has been around for a long, long time and can be found not only in situations dismissed as &quot;feminist,&quot; but in war heroes as well. While there is much more to be told about the psychology of trauma and its after effects, what we know about how it works can be very important information when considering how it can be *used* by those whose goals *are* those very after effects. I would not be surprised if the very people who deny that such a thing as PTSD exists are the ones who are using it to meet their own ends. As I said, there is much to the story of trauma and its uses. This book lays a strong foundation for the investigation of what comes next. It is one of my primary resources.	2001-01-01

It is a very good book for introductory ideas regarding New Age thoughts and philosophies, but it requires a \\"buying into\\" of the concept of an \\"Earthfire\\" that it neither explains nor explores to my satisfaction.  It's just there.  This reminds me too much of the kind of proselytizing other mainstream religions do, and also perhaps is reminiscent of a bit of a \\"mind control\\" technique.  It's too cultish for my tastes, and rather simplistic.  It didn't address any of the serious issues I was hoping it would, except in a very vague and cowardly fashion. Nevertheless, if you can read it with an open mind and get from it the helpful resources regarding various forms of holistic healing, take what you need and leave the rest.  Given that I bought the book because I saw it advertised in Magical Blend magazine, I'm afraid I was just a tad disappointed at how simplistic it really was.	2000-11-01

Depending on what your appetite for the truth is, the book is either a page turner or one that will drag you through reality kicking and screaming. Gail Carr Feldman is the author/therapist that shares with the reader her own journey of discovery while working with Barbara, a client whose own awareness unfolds in the course of therapy. Implanted memories?  I think not...while prior to reading this book I myself questioned the appropriateness of hypnosis in this kind of work, Dr. Feldman so clearly explains her technique that in now way could I feel that the client's integrity had been violated in any way. I'm still not a big fan of hypnosis, but I do think that Dr. Feldman was as professional as could be expected under the circumstances. My main issue with hypnosis in these circumstances is that it puts the credibility of the client/survivor into question at a time when s/he needs to be believed more than anything else. The other issue I have with hypnosis under any other circumstance is that it makes the client very vulnerable to mind control, which, as I am coming to understand, is a lot more prevalent than any of us wants to believe. I also think that hypnosis can uncover memories that the survivor is not yet ready to deal with, creating a dangerous vulnerability to psychosis, but again Dr. Feldman, in her practice, creates a system of subconscious communication gestures that keeps her from delving deeper than the client is willing to go at any given time. She also uses examples of the client correcting any misperceptions she, the therapist, expresses while the client is under hypnosis. That is, if Dr. Feldman attempted an explanation that didn't ring true to Barbara, Barbara would correct her even while under hypnosis...memories could not, therefore, be suggested. I hope this reassures the client, it certainly reassured me.<br />Even more food for thought is presented in the epilogue and closing essays of the book, where Dr. Feldman and Barbara do what they can to bring the issue of what happened to Barbara in her childhood to the proper authorities, with all the evidence they are able to accumulate. The way they were both dismissed is more horrifying and more evil and more satanic than the trauma of the abuse itself, if you ask me.<br />Lessons in Evil, Lessons from the Light is worth an out of print search, I can assure you.e book, where Dr. Feldman and Barbara do what they can to bring the issue of what happened to Barbara in her childhood to the proper authorities, with all the evidence they are able to accumulate.

Try to find it if you can.  The author is a woman who has worked in the system, and isn't afraid to say what's wrong with it, without bitterness, without rancor, with complete honesty.  Mental illness has been an enigma in all societies historically, for a very long time, and we haven't come to terms with it even now.  What keeps the book from being the complete success I wish it was is that her &quot;solutions,&quot; such as they are, are unclear.  I'm also not sure that I agree with them as much as I do understand them.  But I'm glad she took a brave step not many people have been willing to take so far.  I wish there were more like her.  Her research is thorough, though there were some missing pieces I would have included, like what happened to the mentally ill in Nazi Germany, and those from Mendocino state hospital.  But I'll live that for my own book.  Suffice it to say this is a good place to start.  There's much to be done.	2000-10-18

Author of &quot;Kiss Daddy Goodnight,&quot; and &quot;Rocking the Cradle of Sexual Politics,&quot; Armstrong is a seeker of Truth and will stop at nothing to dis-cover what it is that puts America's children at risk and keeps them there.  It is more than professionals and volunteers who can identify with what Armstrong has to say. Those who have partaken of the system can easily identify themselves in the pages that tell one story after another of lies, secrets and betrayal by a system that supposedly exists to rescue and protect our most vulnerable citizens.  While Armstrong sees a system flailing in the wind of incompetence and confusion, I see more.  In a system where no one is held accountable, where those who are targeted with &quot;services,&quot; that are nothing more than &quot;punishment&quot; defined as &quot;treatment,&quot; the Nazification of the social service system has created an open door to those who thrive on the exploitation of children for profit.

If I hadn't already done a lot of reading about Jonestown prior to this book, I would be too. Nevertheless, I'm glad I read it, and would recommend it as an adjunct to any other research on the subject.	2000-09-20

Easy to read through, as I have just done, it is also a  wonderful resource to pull off the shelf as these issues manifest, from  talking to your parents about what needs to be discussed as soon as  possible, to knowing when to intervene and when to get out of the way, what  questions to ask whom, and what to expect.  Information about contacts and  agencies is liberally sprinkled throughout the book, and a helpful index at  the back helps you to find whatever you need at a moment's notice.  An  initial read-through makes you familiar with what the book has to offer,  making it more familiar as the needs arise.  Highly recommended.	2000-09-19

Nevertheless, they are important questions to ask, and hopefully,  in time, we will find the answers.  It is difficult to find proof to  substantiate some of the things he says because those in power are very  good at covering up what they do.  Nevertheless, it is the patterns in  place that make the case, a consistent tendency to &quot;disappear&quot;  those who have the most to offer in terms of information about what is  really going on out there.

Incorporating the  mythology of women as metaphor, Chesler also paints a picture of how we, as  women, have paid the price for patriarchal privilege.

The clutter, the disorganization, her tendency to forget things  made me feel more often like her mother than her girlfriend.  Reading this  book gave me insight that allowed me to be more patient and understanding  with her.  Being judgemental and impatient can only make it worse.<br />Much  to my surprise, I was also able to identify myself, without hyperactivity.  I thought I was totally different from what I understood ADD to be.  In  many ways, I am not that different at all.  I am slower, methodical,  thorough...and very easily overwhelmed.  I came to understand why I prefer  working alone and why I just don't do well at parties.  Understanding my  ideal environment was an unexpected benefit of reading this book.  Clear  and well written, this book can only benefit anyone who chooses to add it  to their pile of clutter...and *reads* it.	2000-09-08

It is crucial to become  aware, to pay attention, and to understand what is happening.  We won't be  able to make a difference after the fact.  We create the world we want.  We  can use the power of our minds and hearts to change the course of history.  First, we must be aware.  &quot;Education&quot; is not what you pay for in  a University.

Jason Berry has taken a very difficult, emotional subject and made it readable,  discernable, and a powerful statement about what happens when we fail to  question authority.<br /><br />Of particular interest to me was his reference to the House of Affirmation in Worcester, Mass., a  self-proclaimed \\"treatment center\\" created and defined of the church, by the  church, and for the church...an institution that self-destructed from its  own corruption. The church determined whether or not a priest was \\"sick\\", what the \\"sickness\\" was, and whether or not they were \\"cured\\" and, therefore, \\"trustworthy\\". The \\"church\\" then decided when they were to be released to work again - to Catholic elementary schools, colleges and universties, Catholic Charities and surrounding parishes and Catholic camps.<br /><br />When I originally wrote this review, information on The House was hard to find on the net. It's not now. Google it. And then hold them accountable! Our entire population continues to suffer from the ramifications of decisions made by the Catholic Church in the 1960s - children who grew up to become parents and others who acted out their trauma on others for generations. Not all did. Some were able to find credible treatment of their own and are speaking out. There are many, many more who passed their traumatization on, and/or became addicted to drugs and alcohol, lies, secrets and denial and/or self-destructed entirely. We cannot address this problem until it has been acknowledged in its entirety. Jason Berry opens the door. May it remain open until all the cobwebs have been cleared.	2000-08-07

I started reading this book with a true desire to learn, with an open mind, what a man had to say about relating to boys.  I am the mother of a  23 year old son, and have an inspiring relationship with him.  Nevertheless, there is always room for improvement, and I wanted to learn.  I kept running into statements that were troublesome for me, though, and  familiar as well.  I tried to keep an open mind.  While his statements  about boys were at times insightful, more often questionable; his  statements about women were incredulous, outrageous, and ignorant if not  downright misogynist.  It all made sense to me as he pointed to his  &quot;feminist&quot; credentials: Christina Hoff-Sommers, Katie Roiphe, and  Camille Paglia.  Horribly disappointed that I had spent money for such  trash, I read on, looking for the small nuggets of &quot;wisdom&quot; that  might, just the same, enhance my understanding of the male sex.  Okay,  there's a nugget here and there...but it's not worth the price of the book.  There are better books out there, and this author would be better off  reading them before he decides who an expert really is.	2000-08-04

This is, indeed, a good place to  begin. Positing male sociolization within a context that includes its  affect on women and children and the family in general, Rotundo is able to  place the history of work, virtue, romance and identity in a way that makes  sense in terms of where we've been.  Hopefully, this will give us a clear  first step in terms of where we go from here.

Then why the effort to silence Duesberg, who is only asking for scientific review of the &quot;evidence&quot; that HIV causes AIDS?  It is  the effort to silence Duesberg that actually adds to his credibility, the  massive effort to keep his thoughts, questions and ideas from the mass of  individuals who might start asking their own questions.  Aren't we taught  to ask questions of our doctors?  Aren't we taught that we have to take  responsibility for our own well being?  Why is it that Duesberg is  considered such a threat to the medical establishment?  Who benefits by his  silence?  Who loses if the truth comes out?<br />From the first chapter:  &quot;our leading scientists and policymakers cannot demonstrate that their  efforts have saved a single life.&quot; Who benefits from testing and  &quot;treating&quot; the &quot;high risk&quot; communities who are, more  likely, dying from the &quot;treatment&quot; that is *not* saving their  lives?  &quot;AIDS itself has not yet affected larger numbers of women nor  has it entered the heterosexual population outside of drug addicts: nine  out of ten AIDS patients is still male, and more than 95 percent still fall  into the same risk categories: homosexual (men), heroin addicts, or, in a  few cases, hemophiliacs.  All other sexually transmitted diseases are  equally distributed between the sexes.  AIDS has not exploded into the  heterosexual population, as do all other sexually transmitted diseases.  Yet, the cry rings out for all pregnant women (especially women of color)  to be tested, to receive treatment *even if they are not sick*, to transmit  AZT to their unborn children, *to save their lives.&quot;  This,  while  expectant mothers will be arrested if they take cocaine or drink alcohol,  and will be lectured if they take so much as an aspirin.  What is wrong  with this picture?<br />David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research  Center of New York, recently gave the key to long-term survival with HIV:  &quot;None had received antiretroviral therapy.&quot;  The chilling news is  that instead of preventing AIDS, the drugs help to bring it on.  The  mortality of AZT recipients is 25 percent higher than that of those in  untreated control groups.  The drug, originally developed for cancer  chemotherapy, efficiently destroys the immune system and causes symptoms  largely indistinguishable from &quot;AIDS&quot; itself.  Even the AIDS  establishment is admitting the problems with AZT today.<br />The anger pointed  at Duesberg is easily understood as he uncovers much of the dirty politics  behind the American scientific establishment: something that can only ring  very familiar bells as the beginning of the epidemic and the confusion  around &quot;who discovered the virus,&quot; come to mind, and the press  conference that *announced* the cause of the &quot;epidemic&quot; as  Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler was ushered,  quickly and quietly, out of the country.  Freedom of speech and scientific  inquiry have gone the way of the wind as patients are expected to  &quot;trust their doctors&quot; and maintain their drug regimen regardless  of the horrendous side effects.<br />We have lost our power of choice.  Duesberg insists that &quot;AIDS,&quot; if it exists at all, is not  contagious and that it is not spread by sexual contact.  In whose benefit  is it to control the sexual behavior and the reproductive capacity of  others through terror?<br />Duesberg *has* offered to inject himself with the  virus.  His stand has cost him a great deal that he could have maintained  by marching to the tune of the AIDS establishment.  Whistle blowers do not  fare well in this society, but they are very important and very  necessary.<br />How quickly we forget the important questions: why is it that  the partner of AIDS patient Rock Hudson, the wife and 8 year old daughter  of Arthur Ashe,as well as the husband of the late AIDS patient Elizabeth  Glasser are HIV and AIDS-free?  Why is it that Magic Johnson seems to be  doing so well?  He won't talk about it, but while Arthur Ashe was on the  medical regimen, Magic Johnson dropped it...and seems to be doing just  fine.<br />Duesberg makes a clear and meticulous case for the correlation of  recreational drug use with the breakdown of the immune system that leads to  the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS.  He also is very clear  that whatever is going on in Africa is another story entirely, and quite  explainable by sloppy science and big money interests.  The current debate  in Africa (that is not making the news) threatens to expose the racist  rationale behind the push of &quot;anti-AIDS&quot; drugs in South Africa.  I can only admire a national leader that would question the agenda of the  multi-national pharmaceutical corporations.<br />It's a big book, and too  thorough to reproduce in a review.  I can only suggest a careful  reading.<br />One more point, though, that will open your eyes as it did mine:  Much money is being funneled to community agencies and medical treatment  centers in the name of Ryan White, the young Indiana teenager who became a  national poster boy for the symbol of heroic battling against AIDS after  his school expelled him as a threat to the other students.  Although the  news media portrayed the death as the tragic end to White's long fight with  AIDS, the doctor never publicly confirmed that the death certificate  actually attributed the cause of death to AIDS.<br />&quot;A phone call to the  Indiana Hemophilia Foundation to check the details generated a very  different story.  A foundation representative directly familiar with  White's case was asked of what specific AIDS diseases Ryan White had died.  Only internal bleeding and hemorrhaging, liver failure, and collapse of  other physiological systems were listed.  These conditions interestingly  happen to match the classical description of hemophilia, none being listed  as peculiar to the AIDS condition, but the representative did not seem to  know that.  It was then acknowledged that White's hemophilia condition was  more severe than the average, requiring him to take clotting factor every  day near the end (extremely high risk, according to Duesberg, for immune  suppression).  On top of all that, White had taken AZT, the former toxic  cancer chemotherapy now prescribed as AIDS treatment.  Hemophiliacs,  needless to say, are particularly vulnerable to the internal ulcerations  induced by such chemotherapy.  Thus, only media hype transformed White's  death from a severe case of hemophilia, exacerbated by AZT, into  AIDS.&quot;<br />Don't take my word for it.  Read this book.  I read it twice.

Thesis, antithesis,  synthesis is the story of the growth of fascism in this millenium.  The  story of the incorporation of Nazi science and medicine into our culture  today is so obvious as to be ludicrous, if anyone took the time to look.  The names that never appeared in the Nuremburg trial.  The medical  experimentation that went on in the 50s, the assassination of the leader of  the free world with hardly a rumble as every policy JFK was implementing  was silently, systematically reversed and drugs and Vietnam took out the  best and the brightest of a new generation.  Radiation experiments, secret  CIA plots and counter plots, mind control projects, remote viewing, lies,  secrets and counter coups...anyone who has the slightest idea that we are  living in the same USA we read about in our history books is very naive  indeed.  This is an important book to read.<br />How bad did the holocaust  have to get before enough individuals with conscience worked together to  *try* to put a stop to it?

Angry?  Unladylike?  Absolutely!  Mary Daly begins by challenging language which keeps us oppressed as women.  It was the work of women that gave a name to  the experiences so many of us share, but could not speak at one time: rape,  battering, incest.  There were no words, once, for what was considered,  &quot;a woman's lot in life.&quot;  These things still happen, but at least  now they can be spoken, at least now they can be challenged, at least now  there may be hope.  The title 'Gyn/Ecology,' according to the Introduction,  is a way of wrenching back some wordpower.  It is men, after all, who up  until now have always had the power of naming, often naming something the  opposite of what it really is (i.e. Military Intelligence, Peacekeeper,  sanitary napkin).  This book is primarily concerned with the  mind/spirit/body pollution inflicted through patriarchal myth and language  on all levels.<br />The fact that most gynecologists are males, says Daly, is  in itself a collosal comment on our society.  It is a symptom and example  of male control over women and over language, and a clue to the extent of  this control.  Add to this the fact that self-appointed soul doctors, mind  doctors, and body doctors who &quot;specialize&quot; in women are  perpetrators of iatrogenic disease (the first time I had ever heard of such  a thing, and have since come to specialize in its research).<br />&quot;The  courage to be logical -- the courage to name -- would require that we admit  to ourselves that males and males only are the originators, planners,  controllers, and legitimators of patriarchy.  Patriarchy is the homeland of  males; it is Father Land; and men are its agents.  It is in the interest of  men (as men in patriarchy perceive their interest) and in a superficial but  Self-destructive way, of many women, to hide this fact, especially from  themselves.&quot;<br />How anyone can call Dr. Daly racist for dis-covering  the historical roots of American Gynecology balanced on the backs of  experimentation on black female slaves by J. Marion Sims, &quot;moving  spirit&quot; behind the founding of the Women's Hospital in New York, is  beyond me.<br />Dr. Daly weaves her understanding of our oppression as women  within and around her understanding of Chinese footbinding, Indian Suttee,  clitoridectomy, and the witchburnings in the Middle Ages.  Violence against  women continues to be endemic, systemic, entrenched in our society, and its  roots grow deep.  Dr. Daly dis-covers and names those roots, and for many,  this is a painful exercise that requires the work of thinking, something  that is more and more dis-couraged in a society that prefers to do your  thinking for you.<br />From the back cover: &quot;Mary Daly is a Revolting Hag  who holds doctorates in theology and philosophy from the University of  Fribourg, Switzerland.  An associate professor of theology at Boston  College, this Spinster spins and weaves cosmic tapestries in her own  time/space.  She is the author of 'Beyond God the Father' and 'The Church  and the Second Sex.'&quot;<br />Dr. Daly is intelligent, a delight to read,  and has earned her stripes.  Her willingness to speak truth to power has  cost her dearly, and has earned my respect.  The violence she is not afraid  to name threatens the very existence of life on this planet.

How unfortunate that we live in a country where sexual harassment is so difficult for men to understand, and yet so pervasively cruel and  persistent!  And how very unfortunate that such a man as Clarence Thomas  now has so much power in our government, power that we know he can not be  trusted with.  But how surprising is that really, today?  Respect for women  is hardly a qualification for office in the US Government, and it may never  be if we don't all work together to make that difference -- and it's going  to be a lot harder than it should be.<br />Anita Hill is a clear, calm,  concise writer with a powerful story to tell.  It is not easy to speak  Truth to Power, but it is an essential element of making a difference.  I  honor all those who take the risk.  I know how difficult it can be.  I also  know how very important it is.  Anita Hill did not choose to be harassed,  and she did not choose to be a weapon, but when called, she responed, and  she told the truth, as awkward as it was for her.  For those who would  ridicule her ordeal, I can only say that no one should have to tolerate the  inappropriate sexual behavior that exists in the workplace.  We know it  exists on the highest level.  We know better than to say it couldn't be  true.  And we know Anita Hill got no pleasure from answering such personal,  humiliating questions.  She did what was expected of her, and it was *her*  integrity that suffered, *her* career that wobbled while Clarence Thomas  triumphed.  His judgement leaves a lot to be desired, IMHO.  I honor the  efforts of Ms. Hill to honor the truth of her experience.	2000-07-28

It is not meant to be a treatise on wicca, but a labor of love that acknowledges and honors the herstory of women judged as witches, making an artistic connection with the  misogyny that too many of today's women have yet to dis-cover, yet that  certainly still exists, particularly when the word &quot;witch&quot; still  retains the power to create havoc that it does.  Erica Jong is not teaching  witchcraft, what she is sharing is the attitudes about witchcraft that led  to the torture and deaths of thousands of women in the Middle Ages.  It is  herstory that is not taught in school.  It is herstory that any witch worth  her salt needs to know.	2000-07-28

Rocking the Cradle of Sexual Politics is the best social analysis of incest and child sexual abuse that I have ever read.  The first woman to publicly acknowledge her status as a survivor in the USA (on the Phil  Donahue show), Louise now looks back to see how far we have come since  then: from the shocked response of the television audience to a growing  profit-making industry in &quot;healing&quot; the survivor. The politics,  says Louise, has fallen by the wayside.  Exploiting the nightmare that is  incest by claiming to &quot;heal&quot; the wounds, we seem to be forgetting  that there is a problem out there, a major one, one that keeps all of our  children at risk, one that is growing larger every day.  The more we deny  the validity of incest, the more we condone the status quo of a society  that nourishes and thrives on the vulnerability of children and the naivete  of those charged with their care and protection.  The State is not the  answer...in more instances than not, it is part of the problem.  It is  only, however, by acknowledging that there *is* a problem that a workable  solution can be found.  This solution will not be simple, easy, or  quick...and it will expose powerful people who do not want to be exposed,  people who benefit from the power and control of exploiting those who are  vulnerable and powerless.  That is the politics of the situation: the  politics of power.  Children are only powerless as long as we continue to  focus on our &quot;careers&quot; as 'healers' rather than in our ability to  empower them as advocates.  Louise Armstrong strongly suggests we have lost  our focus.  As one survivor who has met hundreds of others in my own  healing journey, I strongly agree.	2000-07-28
US	53064010	R39WHSST0QZDQB	156341029X	34783633	Stone Butch Blues	Books	5	30	37	N	N	An important chronicle of Herstory	&quot;Stone Butch Blues&quot; is the story of someone &quot;different&quot; in a world where difference is not tolerated.  This book is an important chronicle of herstory for the gay/lesbian/bi/TG  community.<br />Without spoiling it for the reader, what is more horrendous  than anything else in this book are the chronic &quot;raids&quot; the gay  community had to endure in their gathering places, and the foolish  rules  they had to follow.(ex. in gay bars, women could be arrested if caught  dancing with other women, women had to go into the ladies' room one at a  time and were monitored to make sure they did)<br />&quot;Butch&quot; women,  women who could not 'pass' as straight, ran or hid in the bathroom during a  police raid.<br />Even more humiliating is the police brutality if a  &quot;Queer&quot; got arrested: just for being who they are. Being arrested  was a fear Jess lived with her entire life, not because she feared arrest,  but because she feared what would happen next.<br />How the cop responded to  Brandon Teena (All She Wanted by Aphrodite Jones) will not surprise you  when you see how the cops have exploited and violated &quot;Queers&quot;  for years.  It's their job.  It's part of what we, as taxpayers, pay them  to do.<br />The brutality of hate and oppression is part of the cultural  conditioning of all &quot;real men&quot; that we, as taxpayers, pay our  educators to nurture in our children.  I wonder if we, as taxpayers, are  creative and caring enough to make it stop.	2000-02-24

Not one of Bugliosi's best works, but a true representative sample of a man who does his homework and backs up everything he says with ample evidence.  The man knows what he's talking about, and he knows what is happening to this country and the office of the Presidency with the  ludicrous antics of the Independent Prosecutor.<br />Understanding the concept  of &quot;balance of interests&quot; of Paula Jones v. the National interest  alone was worth the price of the book ... because it helped me to put my  finger on why I have felt so violated by the process as a citizen of the  United States.  We have the right to a President who can focus on the work  we elected him to do.  If he found himself rather confused about the  connection between sex and violence ... that's one of the major drawbacks  of the country we live in, and the people he represents.  Clinton is not  the problem.  He just makes it visible.	1998-12-28

Bugliosi is my favorite true-crime writer, and in this book he has not let me down.  He sounds no different than he did in Helter-Skelter, and if he  is proud of putting Manson away for life, he should be.  Had Manson gone to court today, he would be walking the streets with an even bigger  following.<br />It is true that Bugliosi is as convinced of OJ's guilt as many  others and he makes his case.  He shares a lot of information I was not  privy to from the media circus, like Marcia Clark's ignorance around black  women and domestic violence issues that caused her to make decisions around  jury selection that ended up being a horrible mistake.<br />It is true that  Bugliosi has little tolerance for incompetence, but he explains that by  saying that none of us are perfect, but it appears that we expect  perfection more from celebrities or high calibre (degreed?) professionals  than we do from those of lower rank.  His point is that we need to take  less for granted and look carefully at the work that passes for  professional all around us.<br />The &quot;Dream Team,&quot; for example, was  neither.  It was billed as &quot;the best money could buy,&quot; simply  because it was bought and paid for at great expense by someone who could  afford it.  That did not make them great.  They won only because the  prosecution was worse ... or perhaps, corrupted in some other way.  (for  another point of view, do a search for *Virtual Government* by Alex  Constantine).<br />We do tend to give our power away to those we assume are  smarter than we are because they are doctors, lawyers, professionals and  especially celebrities.  Bugliosi's book is a very important warning to  heed.  Don't assume anything.  Ask questions.  And beware those bearing  sheepskin.<br />May Nicole rest in peace.  Some day those who beat, torture  and terrify their women will learn to regret their daunting deeds, but not  in what passes for the Court of Justice in these United States today.	1998-12-28

This is not an easy book, nor is it a fun book, but it is an important book in the study of hate methodology and its implications for the future.<br />Goldhagen is not saying that Germans were unique in their  capacity for mob cruelty.  What he is describing is the human capacity in  our belief systems to judge others and to find them wanting, to see  ourselves as better than others, and to, in the extreme, see the solution  to the &quot;problem&quot; of those who interfere with our own comfort  their ultimate elimination.<br />Replace the word Jew in this theory with  the words gay, welfare mother, black or Person with AIDS and more current  ideologies of hate easily spring to mind, most uncomfortably, I  hope.<br />Germans were not unique when being fed daily news stories that  blamed the Jews for every ill under the sun.  Given the Christianization of  Germany and the belief that salvation through Baptism and faith in Jesus  Christ would save all sinners, the Satanic aspect of Jewery's refusal to  follow suit while living among them could only point, in their minds, to  the reason for every evil thing that befell their country.<br />A belief that  destroying the Jews would save Germany is easily understood when compared  to the many racist belief systems that propell the Militia and other  extremist cults in the USA and other countries.<br />Most people would rather  not understand what is right under their noses.  Maybe that is why  Goldhagen felt he needed so many words to make his points.  I got it.  I  got it right away.	1998-12-28

Reading a book in 1998 that predicts the end of the twentieth century that was written in 1970 has its moments.  Technology had just begun, and while pollution is a concern, the environment/ecology connection was not quite  yet made.  Some predictions are uncannily accurate, some of the things he  predicts happened sooner, and some have not happened yet.  Some of them, we  have learned, should never happen at all.  Some of them are not as dire as  he seemed to think at the time.<br />For anyone with an interest in a  historical perspective of millenial predictions, this is an interesting  read.	1998-12-28

Not since Andrea Dworkin's &quot;Woman Hating&quot; (that I read in 1978) have I been so moved by the truth of another writer that I would want to emulate it. In sharing Harris's vision of writing as an &quot;uncompromising revolutionary act&quot; the point is made that the mainstream literary world as well as the &quot;so-called avant-garde and burgeoning feminist critical aristocracy&quot; will not appreciate the lesbian writer who &quot;refuses to obey the rules.&quot; To both women, nothing is more important than telling the truth, &quot;refusing all categories, all who would shape your writing to their own use.&quot;<br />&quot;Yes!&quot; I cried, &quot;  The End.	1998-10-16

The incredible stories of  abortions at all stages of pregnancy and women bound and gagged, dragged screaming and crying, to clinics where their children, their hearts and souls, are torn from them sheds a whole new light on the issue.  The chapter about &quot;The Boy Who  Would Not Die&quot; is a turning point for Chi An, and for good reason.  In China, housing, food, clothing, education are guaranteed for all, as long as government policy is followed.  And freedom of speech?  The right to question authority?  Citizens are watched and listened to every minute...solicited for their &quot;opinions&quot; and punished for having the wrong ones...  Chi An Wei has seen the birth of her first child cause the abortion of a neighbor's, has had to live with a policy that has caused her a great deal of anguish.  Now she must reconcile her own pain with the fact that implementing this policy is what she does for a living.  It's a horrifying picture, and a warning to those who would for one minute become complacent about whatever it may mean to have &quot;rights&quot; over our own bodies.  Have you ever had to do something you found morally repulsive in order to make a living?  Chi An Wei's experience is a humbling one...and one I will never forget.	1998-03-22
