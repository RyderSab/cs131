Quite the contrary.  She and her eccentric friend, Harrison, have much to teach all of us about appreciating differentness.   <br /> <br />The angst for Ant in not being honored by her family made it troubling for me to want to continue reading.  I'm glad I did.  Choldenko avoids a \\"happily ever after\\" resolution; keeping perspective with what characterizes growth and reconciliation for people in conflict.  Wisecracks and some of Ant's humorous foibles help take away some of the sting. <br /> <br />Liar and Her Dog is a remarkable book--full of wisdom for reader's of all ages for the message of toleration that we all need reminders about in our life's journey.   <br /> <br />Quite simply, it's an incredibly artful debut novel.	2005-04-19

Choldenko's sister who had autism as well as her time spent as a docent on Alcatraz Island.  It was Choldenko's research that yielded one of the most clever and pranksterish child plots to make money I have read--simply delightful! <br /> <br />The depiction of Moose's sister, Natalie, and a family's perseverence to do the best they know how for her is written with such poignancy that it will indeed move readers forever.

Paulsen's didacticism starkly overshadows the appeal he creates for the child victim.  The \\"protagonist\\" is the weapon.  The audience is general.     <br /> <br />The Rifle is a contemporary fable.  For entertainment, there are extraordinary elements of historical fiction and information, however, Paulsen's main purpose was to comment.  His subject remains controversial-witness the host of passionate, intolerant reviews here that reveal how powerful the writing is.  Compelling and riveting, The Rifle is drama of the highest caliber (no pun intended).  The harshest critics are blinded by their extremism in acknowledging Paulsen's gift. <br /> <br />Paulsen too was caught up in a time of fervor over the Waco cult suicides and the histrionics of the NRA.  No doubt he smirked in contriving a contradiction to \\"people kill people-not guns.\\"  The smirking is made subtle with discourse on gun technology and slips only once to become more sarcastic in reference to a fairly tacky stereotype of Elvis devotees.  Besides drama, perhaps the best feature of the writing was to portray the unseemly and nave lifestyle and perspective of  today's anarchist. <br /> <br />How ironic it was for me at Christmas to pick up this book from my idle stack of children's books waiting to be read and to encounter such provocative writing with a holiday tragedy.  I notice the book is now \\"out of print.\\"  That's unfortunate.  It's an incredible piece of good writing. <br /> <br />Mr. Paulsen, might you today be at work on a fable about our obsession with car racing?  Ha!  <br />	2004-12-24

No doubt, students in grades 4-6 and older must devour it when they find it. It's a \\"wide-eyed, page turner.\\"           Without the story's fascinating background in Native American folklore and the tenacity of its protagonist, \\"Orphan Molly,\\" the disturbing horror of this child's parents' circumstances as a supplement to this goblin tale could be criticized as gratuitous.  I was left wondering if it is really appropriate for children as audience?  Yes, I think so.  If you are skeptical, just recall traditional literature like Little Red Riding Hood or even Peter Rabbit--truly scary stuff.         Written in the first person, the monologue can be stifling.  Characterization is unusually flat for the setting of present day. There is hardly any dialogue. You feel too trapped in Molly's mind.  With folktale as springboard for the story, I wonder if this was intentional by the author?  Revelation can be precisely controlled without dialogue.  The reader doesn't actually know until the climax whether \\"Mr.Goblin\\" will remain magical or turn real. Yet more interaction--at least between Molly and Mr. Goblin--might have made it even more suspenseful and chilling!  Some story elements such as references to TV personalities and the handiness of workers' tools border on being corny and too contrived.         Last, perhaps the most enduring mystery--the fault of the editor/publisher--is the identity of the illustrator.  The oversight is just plain cheap.          Given these shortcomings from the perspective of an adult, Skeleton Man is still high drama.  Your fingers cannot keep pace in turning the pages for your eyes as you read.  It's a worthwhile escape.    ...\\"An' the Gobble-uns'll gits you ef'n you Don't Watch Out!\\"       (Lil Orhpan Annie by James Whitcomb Riley)	2004-12-21
US	45793132	R21FYBYO36NI23	0439372941	194317773	Chasing Vermeer	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Chicken Bones	For a debut by an author in children's literature, Scholastic Publishing Company created deep pockets.  This manuscript must have flashed dollar signs in their eyes; portending a commercial windfall on the level of Harry Potter or Lemony Snicket.  Who could doubt that Brett Helquist, star-studded illustrator, could name his own price to come aboard?  The formatting is clever; the papers and binding, superlative (of all the contributors, the book's designer, Marijka Kostow, may deserve the most applause).  But after sifting through all the glitz and gimmickry, I was reminded of the old adage, \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\"  Inside, the quality of the writing leaves but a mixed reaction in me.     Infusing fantasy into mystery writing in children's literature is not new and it is fantasy that is this tale's mortar.  For children, the mixture will probably be quite wonderful.  They'll be awed by Petra's intuition that is guided by visions of a woman in canvass who seems to communicate to her at key moments in a fashion remotely resembling a sance. They will marvel at the interpretations Calder makes from randomly pulling a pentomino puzzle piece from his pocket-reminiscent of the same manner in which a shaman tosses chicken bones to the ground for fortunetelling.  Little disbelief will be suspended for adults who are oriented to tangible, rational clues leading to \\"Who did it.\\"  But hey, remember, this genre is escapist anyway!       Besides dreams and pentominoes, the other motifs are enticing:  Vermeer; the conceptualization of art; and the phenomenon of coincidence.  Hyde Park and The Art Institute of Chicago make for an engrossing setting. There, the student protagonists' campus immersion into Discovery Learning guides their detective thinking.  Both Constructivism and the quirky examinations about coincidence by Charles Fort are intended to suspend disbelief.  Without impetus from both, you can't begin to \\"think outside the box\\" with chicken bones and nightmares!     By and large, Blue Balliett's writing meets her audience.  And it has potential to inspire in them investigations into art appreciation, patterns, and, I guess, the paranormal.  The shortcoming is the identity of the culprit.  Being one dimensional and having no dialogue, culprit simply doesn't pack a \\"jolt.\\"  If you can challenge the audience--at times, in a pretty \\"heady\\" manner--to contemplate the meaning of art and the phenomenon of coincidence, then surely you can devise something much more sinister. Write out Tommy or allow him to join the dynamic duo and lend his hand to the solution.  Jerome Bruner's \\"devotee\\" would have been the perfect mastermind with the widow and the book merchant the henchmen! That kind of jolt would have really made the news!      At most, the story will be faddish.  It stops well short of enduring like The Westing Game, or ...Basil E. Frankweiler.	2004-10-30

I'm a sucker for these American heartland tales of yesteryear. Peck's use of history and artifacts of the period are mesmirizing (e.g. Karo Syrup cans for lunchpails); his description of the countryside, vivid.  The reader sees, smells, tastes, and hears everthing as Russell and his brother Lloyd walk down Hog Scald Road.  The book stuck like flypaper in my hands--I could scarcely put it down in 2 days of reading.         The humor is uproarious--you'll find yourself spontaneously erupting into loud guffaws!  The storytelling is so well-crafted--so seamless; the writing, graceful and balanced. It will be savored by avid children's literature readers.  Interpersed in the hilarity with poignancy is the low-key, loving guidance of Russell's father as well as his sister Tansy's high expectation and insistance that he achieve versus allow his foibles to become an excuse in the future for failure by his little brother. You will experience tears from laughter; tears from being moved by goodness and love.           And the ending--it's as fine a one as is in N. Babbit's Tuck Everlasting. ...the highest praise by me--it's just superb!         Whatever will the Newberry Committee do next year?  Do they dare recognize Mr. Peck yet a 3rd time for his empassioned flair for writing these wise yarns about our country's rural life in 1st half of the 20th century?  If not, then Mr. Peck earns my vote to join the late Scott O'Dell as a recipient of the Hans Christian Anderson Author Medal.  He is past due.                  Mr. Peck has dedicated The Teacher's Funeral to the memory of his parents.  I can only begin to appreciate how heartfelt and profound the legacy of their lives have been for him; yet, by the end of the story, I know for certain how proud they would be!

Fletcher's description of lighthouse technology and administration and tidal cycles is captivating for someone who has been landlocked most of his life.    What makes the story is the unmasking of fear and loathing toward Chinese immigrant laborers who came to America to bridge our country from Atlantic to Pacific with the building of the railroad and to incur exploitation for the sake of sustaining loved ones back home.    This is the account of the expulsion of Chinese residents from Crescent City, CA due to fears of job loss by white, Christian families.  It is part of my own legacy--Chinese residents were massacred and railroaded out of Rock Springs, WY, my own native state, around the same time.    Fletcher makes good use of artifacts and dialogue of the period to firmly ground the story.  The one shortcoming--Chinese characters are underdeveloped.

The story is just that--and, dissappointing.  An earlier reviewer aptly used the word \\"corny.\\"  It's \\"mush\\" that will appeal to the recreational reading of middle school girls. <br /> <br />The 266 pages of this story posing as narrative is nearly linear and shallow like a fairy tale.  Ed, the troll/foster father, and his rival, a tooth fairy, are simply that in name.  There is little magical or interesting about them in the writing.  Marigold's paranormal \\"curse\\" is more appealing than horrific.  The book survives on farce with sterotypical motifs that will appeal, I suppose, to a younger reading audience.     <br /> <br />Christian builds things like a boy preoccupied with LEGOS.  Yet his biggest creation, the flying machine, is simply that--no description.  Marigold wants a sharing relationship versus a title and dowry.  Dogs abound--some think and make wisecracks.  Olympia, \\"stepmother,\\" mimicks Cruella DeVille. <br /> <br />Reading this fairy tale is akin to picking up that title in the family section at Blockbuster to appease your young children.  You hope that it's wholesome and that it has some substance and merit.  Yet, typcially, you discover it's shallow and that it also contains an adult suggestion of sexuality such as what is depicted with Rollo's girlfriend's seductive behavior with the protagonist. <br /> <br />The interspersion of big vocabulary words in the narrative seems contrived in the flow of dialogue.  Even more distracting for me--many sentences end with prepositions. <br /> <br />The author does have a flair for writing.  At the end, she brings together all the events and problems solved in summation.  But then, preposterously, she matter-of-factly informs the reader that Olympia has survived her fall to the depths of a river and has returned.  Is a sequel contemplated?  I hope not. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2004-10-13

The audience may be a tad older than 4th grade as suggested in the School Library Review; the most precocious 5th and 6th grade readers will truly reap the gifts Ms. Horvath bestows.

In this regard, perhaps he ventured no more than asexual content, but as an adult male myself, I was truly impressed. I wonder if female readers marvel at Henke's accomplishment?      The audience target for this book is strictly limited to girls,   grades 4-9. However, only the most introspective/reflective may find interest/value. There is little suspense or drama.       Protagonist Martha's character is strong, appealing, and most real as someone just beginning to step past the period of childhood. The plot, for the target audience, is mesmerizing: in a moment of infatuation, Martha's innocence is exploited by a cavalier boy's self-serving kiss. It is the portryal of her noble reaction and her turmoil in which Henke shows his talent (the likely motive behind the Newberry Award). And the ultimate lesson, I guess, girls: fall for the modest boy; be wary of his showoff brother! Ha--few of you will do so!      Short chapter construction and brevity in prose highlight Henke's craftmanship. However, he periodically lapses into some artsy, lofty metaphors and ruminations that at minimum come very close to exceeding the boundaries of the target audience.      Martha's grandmother is endearing and the scenes with her are poignant. Grandma invites Martha's intimacy and you sense she would offer wisdom for her granddaughter's turmoil. Yet, &quot;age-typically,&quot; Martha is resistant to being self-disclosive. Indeed, Martha never reveals her exploitation with the significant adults in her life. As an adult reader, I certainly wanted her to. I fear the example portrayed, however, I believe Henke stays grounded by offering a model example of resolution, and in doing so, offers the reader the more attractive peer guidance. Let the audience learn from Martha's experience. And, after all, it was only holding hands and a &quot;peck.&quot;       For me, the major weakness is making significance and connection for the character and circumstances of Olive with the totality of the story. It just doesn't weave together well. Okay, the gift of seawater in a baby jar tugs at the heartstrings, but otherwise, Olive's overall importance seems trivial.      Boring reading? MOSTLY. Olive's Ocean did merit consideration for the Newberry. It fufills the qualities of fine children's literature. And, it deserves at least 4 stars as such. But I would prefer the Newberry be awarded to books with true appeal to both genders.      *The quotation is from the book--oblique, even in the context in which it was used.	2004-08-05

As an enthusiast of children's literature and of American history, I quite don't know where exactly to begin in sharing with you my deep appreciation for &quot;The Land&quot;; Taylor's continuing effort to document her family's rich history and legacy through stories passed down from ancestors of remarkable integrity and strength.      Here, for children (and for &quot;learned&quot; adults like me), Taylor provides an in-depth look at the culture and relationships of the children of the two families of a white landowner: that of his lawful, white wife as well as his former African/Native American mistress.      Here, for the reader, is an expose' of the culture of American mulato children and how the enduring, insidious vestiges of the mores of a society with slavery guide behavior and opportunity.       Here, for the reader, is the South's affinity for horses, furniture making, and its desecretion of forest for turpentine.       Here are the people of the South during Reconstruction living with the confinement of the rigid heritage of racial prejudice and ignorance--even the enlightened white landowner knowing it is yet too soon to go against the grain. Instead, he prepares as best he can his white and black children for their separate worlds.       Here, Cassie Logan's grandparents, against all odds, use their humanity, courage, and determination to eek out their American birthright.      I read it all in 3 nights--it is simply too fascinating--too engrossing--to put down.      For years, I've been using &quot;Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry&quot; in literature circles. Students initially balk (they prefer fantasy) but they soon are ensnared by Taylor's family history and our shared American heritage; some of which we shake our heads at in disbelief. Now, through &quot;The Land&quot;, so much more is revealed. I cannot wait to share it with them!      Thank you, Mildred Taylor, for sharing your family's legacy in such a profound way. Your gift will forever impact our lives by promoting understanding and by buiding strong bonds in our diverse society. You have &quot;done your ancestors and we as Americans proud!&quot;	2003-01-12
US	45793132	RFEZF18XCNO31	0812626710	279867546	Flying Lessons	Books	3	1	8	N	N	Unrequited Anguish	Author Kezi Matthews deals with the grief of a 13 year old protagonist to a much older audience. The story is somber and the plot is lackluster. The appeal of Flying Lessons will be limited to introspective, late teen girls.      As an adult, I appreciated being transported back to the late 1930's. Matthews kept my interest with the artifacts of the time that she weaves into her story. Bus travel, Hollywood divas, transition from icebox to Kelvinator, Western pulp fiction, and stunt pilots all made for much interest. And, I learned that if you were in a middle class marriage in South Carolina, you apparently were still well enough off to afford the services of a full time Negro housekeeper. The time of segregation and Jim Crow are adeptly subdued in this genteel household.      The protagonist is transported from one setting of adults to another. The reader anticipates but is let down that a relationship with a peer named &quot;Truly&quot; instead turns out to be a delusional manifestation of her episodic, psychotic reactions to grief.       Matthews' writing is very skillful. She makes use of poignant description and witty similes and she must have reached deep inside herself to be able to so evocatively portray the impact of grief and the journey to move on. Yet for all the portrayal of the protagonist's soul searching, the reader really has nothing to remember about this book in the future.	2003-01-03
US	45793132	R30B4NYJOOAWGR	0888995067	502603393	The Secret Life of Owen Skye	Books	4	7	8	N	N	"Stand By Me" (rated "G")	Author Alan Cumyn, in his debut writing for children, returns in \\"The Secret Life Of Owen Skye\\" to the theme of the 1980s when so many movies like \\"Stand By Me\\" nostalgically celebrated the charm of the antics and fantasies of boyhood. I applaud him for doing so--let no critic complain he has chosen overused material. It is a worthy one to celebrate and to give a fresh opportunity for today's children to find relish and bemusement. <br /> Writing in the 3rd person--novel to me for this theme--Cumyn shares the story of three brothers of grade school age living in a snaringly appealing, rustic setting with an eccentric family. The\\"remembrances\\" are so quaint that as an adult you readily suspect Cumyn is at least sharing bits of his own boyhood with embellishment. But this author knows his audience. Keeping outside of the story allows him to be adept with minimizing description, word choice, and to focus instead on event. I judge his writing to begin to be accessible to children who are fluent at the 4th grade level. And the audience will easily include that stereotypical boy who prefers information over fiction--he'll devour the antics in this story hook, line, and sinker. Brothers like Owen are ones you want as your \\"buds.\\"<br /> Two features of Cumyn's writing show keen craftsmanship. One is that the brothers' perspectives of the world seem strikingly age appropriate. The other is that Cumyn constantly returns with a flashbacks to past episodes as a memory to revere with action in the present. In the last chapter, Cumin weaves a fast forward of the entire book, which together with tenderly bringing to conclusion Owen's infatuation for classmate Sylvia, leaves you smiling--wanting to shout, \\"YES!\\"<br /> \\"Owen Stryker\\" is wholesome, good-natured storytelling that will be versatile either as a read aloud or in literature circles in the classroom--as well as independent reading. But Dads--AND Moms--read this one at home with that boy who \\"hates\\" to read. Life's messagesin this delectable story may not be as readily discernable for your child as for you, however, I assure you, you will both be charmed by Alan Cumyn's gift.	2002-12-29
US	45793132	R2RZNTPWOT1IGT	0395978270	253944481	A Single Shard (Newbery Medal Book)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Publisher Short-changes the Audience	Tribute is due Linda Sue Park for A Single Shard; criticism to her publisher.<br />     Park takes readers to an unfamiliar time and cultural setting with an engrossing motif of 12 century celadon ceramic ware.  Her prose is spare yet made most appealing and rich with meticulous wording.  All the conventions that make for quality historical fiction for children are observed.  The protagonist experiences conflict and finds appreciation of worthy values didactically embedded in cultural proverb.  An afterward assists with historical context and explanation.<br />     In chapters 6 - 8, Park stretches the limit of her  youthful audience with her penchant for precise language; for example:  \\"lugubrious, commiserate, demise, harangued, feigned.\\"  The solution is simple--acknowledge it and insert a glossary.  Allow children the opportunity to appreciate word choice instead of to avoid it.<br />     Finally, now that the book has earned eternal acclaim from the Newberry, the publisher can easily afford to supplement future editions which would feature photographic plates depicting this extraordinary ceramic ware for the concrete minds of its child audience.  Even pictures of peonies and chrysanthimums would be helpful; not to mention a map of the Korean peninsula highlighting the setting!  <br />     To ignore these aids for children is to diminish the potential for an extraordinary learning experience through this masterful piece of writing.  As a teacher, I will continue to have trouble enticing students to read it.  It will go largely unused and gather dust.	2002-12-07
US	45793132	RTN7QLLKS1BRX	0803725167	788467501	Fair Weather	Books	4	3	3	N	N	...slow start to a dazzling finish	In the same style and spirit of &quot;A LONG WAY FROM CHICAGO&quot; AND &quot;A YEAR DOWN UNDER&quot;, Peck's &quot;FAIR WEATHER&quot; begins slowly but bursts into bloom when the family finally arrives in Chicago.<BR>     The protagonist of Gramma in the first 2 books is transformed into a Grandpa; a Civil War veteran and former sidekick of William &quot;Bill&quot; Cody.  His character is less dynamic but equally eccentric and appealing.<BR>     The story unfolds around a rural family's travel and visitation of the Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893; for me, an obscure event that Peck deftly manages to bring back to life and not only glamorize but impress as to its significance.  There the reader meets Bill Cody, notorious songstress Lillian Russel, the influence of Westinhouse,  prominent, wealthy Chicagoans of the period, and an amazing, gargantuan ferris wheel whose cars held over 30 people.  Historical photographs and a fine afterward compliment the time, setting, and artifacts.  ...bedazzling!	2002-01-10
US	45793132	R34RO87UZR0XIV	0439271991	892044078	Witness	Books	4	13	15	N	N	History at a Glimpse Absent the Supplement of an Afterword	The major shortcoming with &quot;OUT OF THE DUST&quot; is perpetuated in &quot;WITNESS&quot;--historical events and characters referenced in the narrative are not chronicled with supplemental information in an &quot;Afterward&quot;.  <BR>     As a 5th grade teacher well-read in trade books for children ages 9-12, this is really disconcerting.  Author and publisher are overconfident about historical background knowledge they presume children possess at the time of accessing a book.  Appreciation and insight is limited.<BR>     In OUT OF THE DUST, references to the Lindberg kidnapping, the Canadian Quintuplets, and even FDR go right over children's heads.  It will be the same in WITNESS--Clarence Darrow; the Loeb trial; Prohibition and &quot;rum-running&quot;; the allusion to the death of the son of the president who was Coolige's predecessor; minstrel shows; the racist Hollywood movie endorsed by President Wilson; hoods, burning crosses, and the KKK--even the quaint jargon of the 6 year old female protagonist--all are foreign material for children without background. Many literate adults (myself included) would have to refresh their memory by futher reading of some of these oblique references in Hesse's narrative.  I may recall that the KKK enjoyed its highest appeal in the 1920's and made its entry into non-Southern states but I cannot recall the reasons.<BR>     The antidote to my criticism--include an Afterward with historical and biographical sketches. At least give children a picture of a KKK rally or even a hate lynching of a &quot;Negro!&quot;  And if you can present a historical photo of a KKK meeting in Vermont--all the better!<BR>     Two recent trade books of historical fiction for children come to my mind which provide excellent afterwards and/or pictures to really support children's understanding:  &quot;FEVER 1793&quot; by Laurie Anderson, and Richard Peck's new novel, &quot;Fair Weather&quot;.  Factual information enhances the portrayal of artifact innarrative.  Karen Hesse and publisher--have a look!<BR>Your free-verse format is most appealing and approachable for children but help give them a frame of reference!	2002-01-09
US	45793132	R162LS74OF0BG	039304629X	417688480	Jacob's Ladder:	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Fresh Material in Civil War Fiction	It's a   l--o--n--g   read (or listen--I did it by audio during comutes) but there is never a dull moment.  After a couple dozen Civl War novels (including the Shaara's)I find this one and Howard Bahr's &quot;Black Flower&quot; and &quot;Year of Jubilo&quot; the VERY BEST (Frasier's &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; remains the diamond).       Insight into plantation economy and lifestyle; blockade running; imprisonment for abolition in the South; the tribulations of neutrality for the Amish; Virginia gentility and escapism during the conflict; the debauchery of the vigilante Rangers; vivid portrayals of VA battles--all these and more present fresh material for me in Civil War fiction.  Whether accurate or not, McCaig's venture--to illuminate the perspective of slave and VA citizenry during the times--was fascinating. I commend him for his research and prose.	2001-08-18
