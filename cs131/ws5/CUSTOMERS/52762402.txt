If Clive Cussler wrote this piece of garbage, he's either lost his talent, or he's submitting copy to make money.  This is the worst Dirk Pitt novel in the series...and where the hell were the editors.  The copy just doesn't make sense in places, or is laden with inconsistencies and inaccuracies.  E.g., Cussler (or whomever) describes a meal of lobster thermidor; two paragraphs later, it turns into lobster sauteed in butter.  Another:  Pitt jumps in the water during a period when he's in the calm eye of a hurricane.  Next paragraph, the hurricane's second half has come and gone and Pitt starts to do his routine...but what the hell happened when the hurricane hit...no mention...what did Pitt do, slide up and down the mountainous waves?  Third...it's a Cadillac ESCALADE, not Esplanade!<br />This is the kind of rip-off that's becoming more and more prevalent in publishing.

In the first two books in this series, the main character, Lewis Cole, was constantly sweating...in this book, he's constantly shaking...the author would have you believe that it's due to the dangerous situations in which Lewis Cole finds himself...I think it's because he realizes what thin ice this series is on with this latest offering...Nazi uranium, indeed!

Family Values has a 7-page-long fight between Mario and his wife, Ruth...replete with wannas, wouldas and 'causes...well, let me put it in K.C.'s/Mario's lingo:  Geez, I shoulda thrown the book out!	2003-04-17

If you can swallow the idea of an Elizabethan research team and accept the fact that his book deals much more with marital difficulties than murder, then you might--I repeat, might--enjoy this book, but it is definitely not as good as previous offerings in this series.

I thought Joyce Christmas foisted a pretty lousy book on her readers with \\"Going Out in Style,\\" but \\"A Better Class of Murder\\" has to take the prize for being one of the most contrived, ridiculous and unbelievable plotlines ever conceived--one in which the murder is almost an afterthought to the list of restaurants, clothes, etc.  It's pretty clear that Joyce Christmas has either lost her creative edge, or has found what she considers a good way to sell a few more books to unsuspecting readers...but she--and her publisher--ought to be ashamed!

I've read every Spenser mystery, and through the years each one has become just a little less of a &quot;good read.&quot;  This is the worst of the lot.  It's enjoyable because it's another in the Spenser series, but the series is becoming as bad as Lillian Jackson Braun's 'The Cat Who....&quot; books....you know, let's make something up to sell another book....call the plot in and be damned with it...and with the readers!	2001-04-30

For those [with unfavorable comments]....how many historical mysteries have you written and published?  Luren haney is an excellent writer, and while this book may not be up to those of other historical mystery writers, her subsequent volumes in this series definiely are.  Go Lauren!!!!!	2001-03-27

As an author, Charlaine Harris has the right to take her characters and storyline wherever she desires....as a reader, I have the right to say that she's gone too far, and never pick up another one of her books.  Come on, Charlaine...this is supposed to be an enjoyable series...no more movie-of-the-week-scripted endings!	2000-12-04
US	52762402	R2ZCZ7V1RLDJKP	0812575504	789113180	Charon's Landing (Philip Mercer)	Books	1	7	18	N	N	Yuck!	This book is even worse than Du Brul's first, Vulcan's Forge.  The only  good writing in over 500 pages is found in the author's acknowledgements to  the people who helped him.  Too bad one of them wasn't honest enough to  tell him what a rotten writer he is. Does this guy ownm the publishing  company, or what?	2000-08-07

The plot is well thought out, and definitely believable.  A wonderful read!	2000-06-01

They all ought to be available from Amazon.com, too.  They are great!	2000-05-31

The strong, moral uprighteousness of Uncle Abner and the small failings of his friend, the pompous but loyal  Randolph, are here in plenty, but the  identity of the killer provides a delightful and unexpected &quot;locked  room&quot; puzzle.  Buy it!	2000-03-27

US	52762402	R1F3350MVZBY46	0312206259	188088946	The Wicked Winter (A Roger the Chapman Medieval Mystery)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	A good read...but less than expected!	This latest Roger the Chapman mystery was interesting, but not as well &quot;formulated&quot; as the first five in the series.  The plot was somewhat spare and contrived--the story seemed like a bargain-basement  edition of a regular Sedley mystery.  It's almost like the author had to  write this one to meet the terms of a contract with her publisher.	1999-07-20
US	52762402	R14WWAB6ZL71I5	0312198221	700661938	Agatha Raisin and the Wizard of Evesham (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 8)	Books	1	7	11	N	N	boring, far-fetched and full of its own cliches	The last three Agatha Raisin books have shown a decided drop in readability--plot, character growth, etc.--but this is the worst.  It is boring, far-fetched and full of its own cliches...M.C. Beaton is obviously  writing for money, not for pleasure--or any respect for the reader's  intelligence!  Agatha should be killed in the next book (and I'm sure there  will be one) so that we can all breath a sigh of relief.	1999-06-10
US	52762402	R2BF5L6XJL75WZ	0373262558	304010129	Murder At St Adelaide's	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Good book, but main character remains a mystery!	This was a pretty good &quot;first effort&quot; by the author...interesting plot, different setting.  However, most of the characters weren't well developed.  This was especially true in the case of  the main character, Detective Frances Finn.  At the end of the book, I  still felt like she was more of a mystery than the plot had been.  Hope  this is rectified in next novel.	1999-02-23
US	52762402	RCATL2K2RL15O	037326237X	295462936	Caravaggio Books	Books	3	4	4	N	N	A good first effort that has moments of great writing	The author has done an excellent job of starting what I hope is a series.   He still needs to smooth out his character dialogue style (no one uses the  other person's name in every sentence of a conversation!), but the plot is  well conceived, and the main character, Phil Costanza, is a likable--and  believable--person.  There is one pasasge in the book in which an old  professor lays dying in the hospital.  Costanza's interaction with the man  (and with the attending physician before and after the death) and the  description of the man's dying thoughts is truly a beautiful piece of  writing.  In fact, it's almost as if it were by a different, better writer.   Hopefully, Mr. Peterson will extend this excellence throught his entire  next book.	1998-08-27
US	52762402	R1SBVYRXOG98GQ	0380782448	700176555	Out of Circulation: A Miss Zukas Mystery	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Obnoxious main character--but try and put the book down!	If it's true that there is some of a book's main character in the author, I pity Jo Dereske's family.  Helma Zukas is a self-righteous, prim old maid who seems to have a case of arrested social development.  And her best friend, Ruth, borders on the unbelievable.  On the other hand, it is pretty much impossible not to finish the first book, and then want the others in the series immediately.  It's because we see touches of humanity starting to emerge from Helma Zukas...and we want to be there for the final unveiling.  Also, some of her ways take many readers back to a time when social conventions were stiffer...but the world was a lot nicer place!	1998-07-24

They are extremely entertaining reading, with totally believable characters and plots.  I love finding a new mystery series that's so good you ration your reading time and feel somewhat dismal until amazon.com announces the newest book.  Come on Jeff....we're all waiting impatiently!!!	1998-07-24
US	52762402	R3K3ERYTVRUOR	0373261837	183079663	Trail Of Murder	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Main character and author both need to work a little harder!	I don't know who annoyed me more--the main character, who needs a stiff kick in the butt and a verbal urging to &quot;get a life&quot;; or the author, who can't seem to write a page of copy without trying to cram in every idea used by mystery writers during the past 100 years.	1998-07-20
