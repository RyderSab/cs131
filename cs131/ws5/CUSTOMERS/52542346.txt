Card, who's a Mormon, uses the biblical story of Rachel and Leah and their handmaids, Bilhah and Zilpah, as a framework and creatively fills in the details.    As in the other two books, he does a clever job of spinning a tale that makes some sense of the odder parts of the biblical story. Also as in the other books, the characters never felt entirely like real people to me. I've enjoyed the books in this series more as spiritual literature than as novels. (If you're a fan of Card's science fiction and fantasy but aren't interested in religion, I wouldn't recommend this series.)    Card explains in an afterword that he had intended to tell the story of these women in one volume, but there was too much to tell, so the story will be continued in another volume. This book, which ends with Leah's and Rachel's marriages, doesn't feel incomplete, so I was glad rather than annoyed that there will be a sequel.    This is my favorite of the \\"Women of Genesis\\" books, but I liked Card's \\"[[ASIN:1573456632 Stone Tables]],\\" a novelization of the life of Moses, even better. I also recommend his \\"[[ASIN:0312876068 Saints]],\\" about one of the wives of Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormons.    P.S. Seven years later, still no sequel. Oh well.	2004-08-14

It now has a worthy competitor in Damien Keown's \\"Dictionary of Buddhism.\\"    Keown's dictionary includes over 2,000 entries, as compared with the Shambhala dictionary's 1,500+, and is more up-to-date. Keown includes long and helpful entries on the history of Buddhism in particular places (e.g., Sri Lanka, Japan, Britain) and entries for issues like abortion, cloning, diet, and reincarnation. And Keown has more extensive coverage than Shambhala of Western Buddhism (including entries on, e.g., Alan Watts, Christmas Humphreys, the Buddhist Churches of America, and Naropa University).    But the coverage of Zen isn't as extensive in Keown as in Shambhala. E.g., Keown doesn't include entries for oryoki, rakusu, mokugyo, or tenzo--all in Shambhala. And Keown includes only the more prominent Zen teachers. E.g., there are no entries for two of Dogen's teachers (Myozen and T'ien-t'ung Ju-ching) or one of Hui-neng's two main successors (Ch'ing-yuan)--all in Shambhala. The Shambhala dictionary also includes a Ch'an/Zen lineage chart.    Keown includes many more cross-listings than Shambhala from English terms to their Sanskrit equivalents (e.g., if you look up \\"emptiness\\" in Shambhala, you'll find nothing, not even a cross-listing to the entry for \\"sunyata\\"; in Keown there's a cross-listing). Keown also includes a helpful chronology of important events in Buddhist history and a listing of the major Buddhist scriptures in the Pali, Chinese, and Tibetan canons. Keown's pronunciation guide is not nearly as helpful as Shambhala's and offers no help at all for Chinese terms.    Overall, I think the Keown dictionary is a bit better, but if you're particularly interested in Zen, you may want the Shambhala dictionary instead or in addition. Both are very good dictionaries, but I'm still wishing for one that combines the virtues of each and is even morecomprehensive than either.	2004-03-12

As his memory returns, we learn that he's a photographer who makes his living shooting fake UFO photos for tabloids, and he was riding his motorcycle through West Texas when something happened--but what? And why is he wanted by the law? And why is this mysterious stranger taking care of him?    The story is compelling, but what I found particularly fascinating about the book is that, because the point-of-view character has been blinded, the richly descriptive narration tells us how things sound, feel, smell, and taste--everything but how they look.	2004-01-22
US	52542346	R253C6PA5498H	0861713176	313244827	How to Raise an Ox: Zen Practice as Taught in Master Dogen's Shobogenzo	Books	5	33	33	N	N	On Zen practice: clarification & inspiration	This book is a translation and explication of selected essays by Dogen, the 13th-century Zen master who founded the Soto school of Zen in Japan and is regarded as one the world's great religious teachers. Francis Dojun Cook was a professor of Buddhism and a serious Zen practitioner (he was a student of Maezumi Roshi, founder of the Zen Center of Los Angeles), and his primary aim in this book is \\"to help the reader gain a better understanding of what it means to practice Zen, particularly in the Soto form established by Dogen Zenji.\\"    The first half of the book is Cook's introduction to the Dogen texts, highlighting and clarifying some important themes. The second half is Cook's translations of the \\"Fukan zazengi\\" (\\"General Recommendations for Doing Zazen\\") and nine chapters from the \\"Shobogenzo\\"--texts chosen because they focus on various aspects of practice. At the end of the book is a lineage chart including many of the Zen masters mentioned in the Dogen essays.    Ch. 1 is mainly about how Dogen understands practice. Ch. 2 is about faith as the basis of Dogen's Zen. (Cook defines Buddhist faith as \\"a very deep certitude in the veracity of a certain doctrine, accepted and used as a touchstone for conduct in the faith that practice will verify its truth.\\") Ch. 3 is about arousing the thought of enlightenment (bodhichitta)--that is, arousing the determination to work ceaselessly to liberate all other beings from suffering and delusion, even while not being completely liberated oneself. Ch. 4 is about Zen as a means of dealing with karma and its consequences, not by \\"transcending\\" conditioned existence but by radically affirming and fully experiencing it. Ch. 5 is about the role of the scriptures in Dogen's Zen. (Cook observes that the verse attributed to Bodhidharma cautions only against \\"dependence\\" on words and letters, not against making use of them.) And Ch. 6 is about the continuous practice needed to live each moment fully, with wisdom and compassion.    Myown practice can actually get derailed by questions like \\"Where do I get the motivation to practice, if not from the just the sort of self-centered attachments and aversions that I'm hoping to let go of through Zen practice?\\" and \\"How do I practice without making it an exercise in trying to get something I lack, thus denying the inherent buddha-nature I'm hoping to realize?\\" This book deals with such issues in a way that I found very helpful. (As usual, I found Dogen's interpreter more helpful than Dogen himself. Maybe someday I'll be able to get more inspiration from Dogen directly?) I also appreciated Cook's argument that Dogen's faith-based Zen is much more akin to a religion of \\"other-power\\" (tariki) like Pure Land Buddhism than to a religion of \\"self-power\\" (jiriki), which is how Zen sometimes gets characterized.    One tiny complaint: Cook slips into some of the caricatures of Christianity that I find tiresome in Zen literature. I wish Zennies would stick with talking about Zen and not try to compare Zen with traditions they don't know as much about.    Another Dogen commentary I highly recommend: \\"[[ASIN:157062674X Flowers Fall: A Commentary on Zen Master Dogen's Genjokoan]]\\" by Hakuun Yasutani Roshi.	2003-06-05

Coleman, a sociologist and a practicing Buddhist, takes a look at the history, practices, teachings, demographics, problems, and trajectory of this new Buddhism. Although the book is ostensibly about \\"Western\\" Buddhism, it's actually mainly about American Buddhism, with occasional mentions of British Buddhism.    I think this book will especially be of interest to practitioners of the \\"new Buddhism\\" who want to learn more about our history and our fellow practitioners. It could also be used as a text in a college course on Buddhism or on American religion. (If you want to learn about all the major forms of Buddhism in the U.S., I would recommend Richard Hughes Seager's \\"[[ASIN:0231108699 Buddhism in America]],\\" which includes chapters on Jodo Shinshu and Soka Gakkai as well as Zen, Tibetan, and Theravada Buddhism.)    After an introductory chapter, Chs. 2 and 3 provide an excellent overview of the history of Buddhism in Asia and in the West, including the main schools, practices, and teachings. Coleman does an impressive job of covering the important points in a small space while also keeping it interesting. Ch. 4 discusses in detail the practices and beliefs of Zen, Tibetan, and Vipassana Buddhism and their similarities and differences. Ch. 5, \\"Sex, Power, and Conflict,\\" explores issues of gender, sexual passion, and homosexuality in the history of Buddhism and in the new Buddhism and examines the scandals revolving around sex and power in Buddhist centers in the 1980s. Ch. 6 includes a look at the demographics of the new Buddhists (very well educated and very liberal), describes the typical path that Westerners follow into Buddhism, and considers reasons for Buddhism's growing popularity. And Ch. 7 briefly considers the future of Buddhism in the West.	2003-05-24

It may be of interest to different readers for different reasons:<br /><br />(1) It's a study of a particular period in JAPANESE HISTORY, highlighting \\"the dominant ideological concerns of the period and the consequences of those concerns for individual and institutional action.\\"<br /><br />(2) It's a study of PERSECUTION and responses to it, using as a case study the Meiji Buddhists, who managed to transform themselves from heretics to martyrs.<br /><br />(3) It's a study of JAPANESE BUDDHISM. Meiji Buddhism was \\"caught in the crossfire between Shintoists, enlightenment thinkers, nationalists, imperialists, economists, Confucians, and the newly emergent scientists and historians . . . as they did battle over the correct interpretation of 'civilization and enlightenment.'\\" Japanese Buddhism not only survived persecution but, in responding to this persecution and also to critiques from within, managed to reconstitute itself as nonheretical. This was done so effectively that the Meiji persecution of Buddhism \\"is all but forgotten in chronicles of Japanese history,\\" and the \\"modern Buddhism\\" produced by the Meiji Buddhists came to be central to Japan's self-understanding.<br /><br />Ch. 1 examines the critiques of Buddhism in the Tokugawa era that set the stage for persecution in the Meiji era--historicist, nativist, and economic critiques. Ch. 2 examines the Meiji persecution of Buddhism and some Buddhist responses to it. Ch. 3 examines the creation of a national ideology and the institutions designed to promulgate it, including the Great Teaching Academy, and the Buddhist-led countermovement that closed the academy and transformed Buddhism \\"from a persecuted other to a paradigmatic martyr of the illustrious heritage of the nation.\\" Ch. 4 examines the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago and its role in Japanese Buddhism's self-(re)definition as modern, cosmopolitan, and universally applicable. And Ch. 5 examines the way in which a unified vision of Meiji Buddhism and a new history were created and how they were used in producing a Buddhist claim to religious universality.<br /><br />I read this book mainly to learn about the Japanese Buddhism that was transmitted to the U.S., and I was interested to learn that it wasn't just Western Buddhists who were responding to accusations that Buddhism is passive or who were touting Buddhism as an eminently rational religion. Japanese Buddhists were already refiguring Buddhism as socially useful and as compatible with an enlightened society and a scientific worldview.	2003-05-04
US	52542346	R34NOT9YKC0RWL	0807849065	58504858	The American Encounter with Buddhism, 1844-1912: Victorian Culture and the Limits of Dissent	Books	5	9	9	N	N	An insightful study of Victorian American Buddhism	This historical and sociological study of Buddhism in the U.S. from 1844 to 1912 provides insight not only into American Buddhism but also into American culture in the Victorian period and the interactions between new religious movements and the values and beliefs of the dominant culture. The book is academic but not obtuse, and it's relatively engaging.    Tweed explores in detail the ways in which European-American converts to and sympathizers with Buddhism in the Victorian period both dissented from the dominant culture and also consented to it, and he observes that to be successful, a new or transplanted religious movement needs to be different but not too different from the dominant culture. Tweed argues that Buddhist adherents and sympathizers shared a number of basic Victorian American values and beliefs that Buddhism, as it was then understood, seemed to contradict: theism; individualism (a label that Tweed actually uses for two distinct things: the belief in a substantial and immortal self and an emphasis on self-reliance); optimism (a belief in the basic goodness and inevitable progress of individuals and history); and activism (an emphasis on moral action to uplift individuals and reform societies). In contrast, Buddhism was seen as atheistic, nihilistic, pessimistic, and passive. Although some Americans attracted to Buddhism were able to reject theism and the belief in a substantial self, very few were able to relinquish their commitments to optimism and activism, and they rejected interpretations of Buddhism as pessimistic and passive. Tweed finds that two major sources of Buddhism's appeal during the Victorian period were the perception that Buddhism was more compatible than Christianity with science and the perception that Buddhism was more tolerant than Christianity and Victorian culture toward religious and cultural outsiders.    Tweed also provides an interesting typology of Euro-American Buddhist adherents and sympathizers in Victorian America: the \\"esoteric,\\" \\"rationalist,\\" and \\"romantic\\" types.    Also recommended: \\"[[ASIN:0231108699 Buddhism in America]]\\" by Richard Hughes Seager.	2003-03-23

Now what?    Howard and Barton, two Harvard researchers in education, argue in Ch. 1, \\"Writing Is Thinking,\\" that writing is about generating ideas, not just communicating them, and that writer's block comes from preoccupation with the \\"performance\\" aspect of writing (and also from the myth that you need to wait for flashes of insight from a fickle \\"muse\\").    Ch. 2, \\"From First to Last Draft,\\" explains a process that puts concerns about performance at the very end, where they belong: (1) Record every thought you have on your topic--half-formed thoughts, confused thoughts, silly thoughts, sentences, phrases, lists, feelings, questions--quickly, with no concern about clear formulation, aiming for quantity, not quality. (2) Go over these notes and give topical labels to large and small chunks of text. (3) Retype your notes (don't cut 'n' paste), grouping sections by topic. While this step is fairly simple and mechanical, you'll inevitably do a bit of rethinking, ammending, and revising along the way, but without stirring up performance anxiety. (4) Rearrange the topics into a sensible sequence. (5) NOW work on performance issues.    The remaining chapters are about organizing ideas into an essay format, making an argument, and grammar and punctuation. These chapters may be helpful too, but I think the real gift of this book is not so much that it helps you write well but that it helps you write instead of not writing.    The process works. I can vouch for it. I'm hyper-perfectionistic, but with the help of this book and Anne Lamott's \\"[[ASIN:0385480016 Bird by Bird]],\\" I wrote a book without ever getting paralyzed in front of a blank screen.	2003-01-08

Turner traces these metaphors from the Hebraic and Greek traditions (specifically, Moses' encounter with God on Mt. Sinai and Plato's \\"Allegory of the Cave\\") through Denys the Areopagite (Pseudo-Dionysius), Augustine, Bonaventure, Eckhart, \\"The Cloud of Unknowing,\\" Denys the Carthusian, and John of the Cross, with mentions also of Julian of Norwich, Marguerite Porete, and Teresa of Avila, among others.<br /><br />Turner's thesis is that the contemporary understanding of these metaphors, which assumes that this language points to experience, is so different from the medieval understanding, which rejected \\"experientialism,\\" that it doesn't make sense to speak of a single \\"mystical tradition\\" encompassing both. I'm not sure I finally bought the argument, but I enjoyed the ride. Turner explores lots of interesting issues along the way, e.g., the use of paradoxical language in theology; systematic \\"vs.\\" mystical theology; the unknowability of the self; the ascetic practice of detachment; and John of the Cross's \\"dark nights\\" in relation to depression.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book unless you have some background in theology and philosophy and have read at least a few of the authors Turner discusses. Turner writes well, but the book is dense and academic. I'm not sure I would have read the whole thing if it hadn't been assigned reading for one of my doctoral courses, but I'm glad I did. I now have a much better understanding of the Neoplatonic tradition in Christianity and of how the various famous mystics are connected with one another, and Turner provides lots of food for thought about the Western Christian mystical tradition.	2002-06-03

The angels have hollowed out a tomb in the Arctic ice, and the Vatican hires an oil tanker to tow God's corpse to its final resting place.     Despite how that might sound, the book didn't strike me as particularly  irreverent (and I'm a practicing Catholic). In Morrow's universe, what counts is a sincere and thoughtful concern for truth and goodness and forgiveness. The run-of-the-mill Christians come off as foolish and only superficially \\"faithful,\\" but the Jesuit scientist/theologian and the Carmelite nun are two of the more admirable characters. The dogmatic atheists come off as narrow-minded bigots, but the reflective atheists who actually care about truth and about saving people from suffering are okay.     The interesting questions that are raised by God's \\"death\\" aren't explored as well as they might have been, and the romance is unconvincing, but this is still an entertaining story.	2002-04-28

Halperin is convinced--and wants his readers to be convinced--that we will soon be able to stop the process of aging and, thus, that we should have ourselves frozen shortly before death, to be revived when medicine has advanced far enough to halt and reverse aging and to cure our diseases. Halperin presents his case in the form of a story about a man who is frozen in 1988 and revived in 2072, when aging has been conquered.    I read this book a few years ago and have continued to think about the ideas in it. It seems reasonable to suppose that we will indeed eventually figure out how to halt aging and that this will be one of the most radical turning points in human history--that future humans (the rich and powerful ones at least) will die only of \\"unnatural\\" causes.	2002-04-19

I'm a Zen practitioner and a Ph.D. student in religion, and I've wanted to know more about the Heart Sutra, but this book is so dense and thoroughly academic that it sat on my shelves mostly unread for several years. When I finally read it because it was assigned in a class, I found it rewarding and learned a lot about the Heart Sutra and Mahayana Buddhist thought more generally.

The scientists who make this horrifying discovery have a plan to save a small remnant of humanity.     The story is engaging enough that I was content to suspend my disbelief at the implausibility of the disaster and especially of the opportunity for survival. Much of the entertainment value of the book is in its being old: news of the impending disaster is spread by newspaper; atomic power is being hastily developed; and the attraction between two main characters is expressed only in passionate kisses.    There's plenty of apocalyptic fiction I'd recommend over this (e.g., \\"[[ASIN:0307387895 The Road]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:0345487133 Earth Abides]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:0451169530 The Stand]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0060741872 Alas, Babylon]]\\"), but \\"When Worlds Collide\\" is entertaining enough for a rainy Saturday.	2002-03-27

There's little new science or technology (at least as far as I got), just some details about the domes on Venus. And I found the main characters flat and uninteresting.

Washington, DC, and San Antonio are vaporized. New York City is left in ruins. Electromagnetic pulses wipe out computers and electronic car ignitions.

Five years after Warday, two writers tour what was the United States to assemble this documentary of life after the war, weaving together interviews, government documents, and the chronicle of their travels.     The possible consequences of nuclear war are presented convincingly and in detail, in an understated, journalistic style that makes the book quietly frightening.

This could've been a much better book if she'd left the axes in the shed.    I liked the protagonist, Benita Alvarez-Shipton, a self-educated mom from New Mexico who has an abusive, alcoholic husband. I liked the main aliens and their culture and their mission to Earth. And I liked the touches of humor, like when the aliens cause an \\"ugly plague\\" among women in Afghanistan so that the men won't have an excuse to keep them covered and cloistered.    I expect a feminist agenda from Tepper, usually handled with a fair degree of subtlety and creativity, but in this book, we get heavy-handed polemics on practically every political and social issue in the U.S.--the environment, education, the \\"drug war,\\" the legal system, the ACLU, abortion, conservative religion, you name it. Yeesh!    And yet, I liked the characters enough and was curious enough to find out what happened that I read the whole book and mostly enjoyed it.

As our protagonist, Adam, returns from the arctic, all the humans and many of the animals he encounters are dead. Adam travels all over the world, looking for other living people and, understandably, going kind of bonkers.    I wanted to like this book more. Early in the book, Adam finds himself in many morally challenging situations, but he has these voices in his head that more or less compel him to act in certain ways, so the reader is prevented from really entering into any moral struggles with him. I liked the writing, but each place Adam goes is essentially like the rest--everyone's dead--and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Near the end, something finally did, but then I mostly wanted to slap Adam around for being so dense.    Maybe I'm just jaded from reading too many post-apocalyptic stories and that's why I'm not more enthusiastic about this book. If you're new to this sort of story, you might find this book to be a powerful exploration of loneliness and the meaning of human society and human life.

I thought it might get tiresome to read an entire book in this mutated English, but after only a page or two, I was into it, and I enjoyed the language all the way through. (Try reading it aloud when you having trouble making sense of it.)     What I didn't like: I got bored about halfway through. I expected a gradual uncovering of interesting details of England's history from our time through Riddley Walker's time--when the culture of \\"Inland\\" is non-industrial and mostly illiterate, with packs of wild dogs everywhere--but you don't learn much more than can be inferred early on. Or else I expected Hoban to do more with one of the issues he plays with, like how a culture's stories evolve or the value of moving forward even when what's ahead is troublesome.	2002-02-27

Orson Scott Card is one of my favorite authors, and in some recent Amazon-surfing, I was delighted to discover this Card novel that I'd never heard of. I got a used copy, and I really enjoyed it. The book is based on the 1989 movie \\"[[ASIN:B00005V9IL The Abyss]]\\" by James Cameron, who did \\"Aliens,\\" \\"Titanic,\\" and the \\"Terminator\\" movies. It's about a deep-sea mission, some cool aliens, and a bunch of interesting people, their relationships, and their deepest personal struggles.    (A similar undersea sci fi adventure is Michael Crichton's \\"[[ASIN:0345353145 Sphere]],\\" which I didn't like, but the average customer review is 4.5 stars, so if you're into thrillers, you might like it. And I highly recommend most anything by Orson Scott Card, especially \\"[[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game]],\\" one of the best science fiction novels ever, and, if you're into religion, \\"[[ASIN:1573456632 Stone Tables]],\\" which is a novelization of the life of Moses.)	2002-01-03

(The others are \\"[[ASIN:0765341174 Sarah]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0765341298 Rachel and Leah]].\\")    Card, who's a Mormon, uses the biblical story of Rebekah as a framework and creatively fills in the details. Once again, he has done an impressive job of making sense of some odd biblical scenes and has told an engaging story that is also spiritually nourishing. I wished, though, that Card had filled in more of the details. The book felt too sketchy in some places. And like Sarah in the first book in the series, Rebekah was, I thought, a little too easy to identify with. In her attitudes about gender roles, indentured servants, and such, she seemed too much like a time traveler from 21st-century America who'd taken Rebekah's place. The use of casual, contemporary diction in the dialogue added to this effect.     This isn't among my favorite Orson Scott Card books, but that's tough competition. I've enjoyed the \\"Women of Genesis\\" books enough that I hope there will be more in the series. I liked Card's \\"[[ASIN:1573456632 Stone Tables]],\\" a novelization of the life of Moses, even better, and I also recommend his \\"[[ASIN:0312876068 Saints]],\\" about one of the wives of Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormons.	2002-01-02

This small book is a commentary on the Heart Sutra by the Japanese Rinzai Zen master Hakuin Ekaku (1686-1768). Hakuin goes through the Heart Sutra a word or phrase or line at a time, commenting usually with a paragraph of prose followed by a verse. Translator Norman Waddell adds helpful notes about the Buddhist doctrines, Chinese folktales, and so forth, that Hakuin refers to. And the book is illustrated with Hakuin's own calligraphy and paintings.    Hakuin writes in the incisive, poetic, paradoxical style that I think of as \\"Zen-speak\\" when it gets imitated poorly, but this is the real thing. Hakuin's writing is lively, funny, often sarcastic or scatalogical.    Here are a couple of bits I especially liked, to give you a sense of Hakuin's style: Commenting on the line \\"Form is no other than emptiness, emptiness no other than form,\\" Hakuin says, \\"A nice hot kettle of stew. He ruins it by dropping a couple of rat turds in. It's no good pushing delicacies at a man with a full belly. Striking aside waves to look for water when the waves _are_ water.\\" Commenting on the phrase \\"is delivered from all distress and suffering,\\" Hakuin offers this verse:     The ogre outside shoves the door,   The ogre inside holds it fast.   Dripping sweat from head to tail   Battling for their very lives,   They keep it up throughout the night   Until at last when the dawn appears   Their laughter fills the early light--   They were friends from the first.    If you'd prefer a commentary in a more ordinary, explanatory style, try Albert Low's \\"[[ASIN:0804832013 Zen and the Sutras]],\\" which includes a chapter on the Heart Sutra, or Thich Nhat Hanh's \\"[[ASIN:0938077112 The Heart of Understanding]].\\" If you're looking for a scholarly commentary, try Donald Lopez's \\"[[ASIN:0887065902 The Heart Sutra Explained]].\\"	2001-11-29

It's also an interesting version of the &quot;teleological&quot; argument for the existence of God: the argument that since the world and the creatures in it show evidence of having been carefully and intelligently designed, there must be a Designer. This story takes that argument to a cosmic scale, as the alien scientists/theologians enlist our help in their project.<br /><br />(It doesn't seem to me, though, that proving that the universe was designed proves that God exists. I mean, it might've been designed by a committee rather than a single Designer, and the designer(s) might not be good but evil or at least incompetent--as might well be inferred by all the suffering in the world--and might not be loving, just, merciful, or any of that good, God-like stuff.)<br /><br />Anyway, it's a fun book, whether you're interested in religion or not.	2001-11-28

Great premise: The year is 2021, and not a single child has been born anywhere on earth since 1995. No one can figure out what's happened or how to fix it.    I like James's writing style, and I really liked the first half of the book, spinning out the individual and societal consequences, mainly in England, of the end of human procreation and the impending end of our species. But then James throws in an odd twist, and the second half of the book seemed like it belonged to a slightly different novel, one that I didn't like nearly as well. Also, I didn't see the point of the shifts between first- and third-person narration.    Despite feeling a bit disappointed, I did enjoy the book, but there are better novels about the impending end of the human species, e.g., Nevil Shute's \\"[[ASIN:0345311485 On the Beach]]\\" and Cormac McCarthy's \\"[[ASIN:0307265439 The Road]].\\"	2001-11-28

A massive earthquake along the New Madrid Fault shook the Mississippi Valley in 1811, and we're due for another one. This book is about the next major New Madrid earthquake and the violently changed landscape and societal devastation that result. Williams seems to have done his research, and this book makes it seem crazy that anyone lives in the Mississippi Valley.     The book follows numerous characters, including an out-of-work aerospace engineer, an adolescent skateboarder from L.A. who just moved to the Midwest with his New Agey mom, a fundamentalist preacher, a KKK sheriff, the general in charge of the Mississippi Valley Division of the Army Corps of Engineers, the manager of a nuclear power plant, and the U.S. President.

I was hoping and expecting that the book would focus on imagining in detail the ramifications of this invention on specific individuals and social institutions. But instead, that was more the background to the story, which focuses on the life of the inventor of the truth machine--from a childhood trauma, through his undergraduate years at Harvard and his vision of the truth machine, through the development and worldwide use of the truth machine.	2001-11-28

Maverick, the &#34;half Cherokee, half Haitian black, half Southern cream&#34; owner of the Mystic Eye in the Haight-Ashbury, and Chiron Cat's Eye in Draco, a 25th-century time-traveler who needs to make sure that the Axis survives the hot dim spot of the Summer of Love. According to Tenet Five of the Grandfather Principle, Chiron can't let anyone know he's from the future, but with San Francisco full of flower children and Hells Angels, reincarnated pharaohs and men from Mars, Chiron can simply tell the truth, and people say, &#34;Dig this,&#34; and pass the pipe.  Lisa Mason shows all sides of the Summer of Love: innocence, foolishness, mind-expansion, addiction, freedom, anarchy, loving each other, using each other, anti-capitalism, dealing, stealing, turning on, tuning in, wisdom, naivete, creativity, depravity, and all sorts of experimentation. You may both wish you'd been there and be relieved that you weren't. This is an interesting trip through 1967, with glimpses of 2467 and of the mess that the 20th century creates for the 25th and vice versa.

I like post-apocalyptic stories; this one is about a U.S. ship carrying perhaps the last humans alive after a nuclear war. The book gets you inside the life and mind and worldview of a sailor, which I found fascinating. I was drawn into the quandary of how to create a stable society with such a high male/female ratio (though I didn't believe their solution would work nearly as well as it did). And I did like one of Brinkley's writing quirks, which some readers might find annoying: he can take three pages to narrate a five-second conversation because he includes so much detail about what's going on in the head of the ship's captain, who's the narrator.<br /><br />For other non-sailors: The word \\"ways\\" can be a singular noun meaning \\"an inclined structure upon which a ship is built or supported in launching.\\" (I couldn't make any sense of the opening sentence until I looked that up.)<br /><br />Better post-apocalyptic novels: \\"[[ASIN:0345487133 Earth Abides]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:0060741872 Alas, Babylon]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:0451169530 The Stand]],\\"  \\"[[ASIN:0345311485 On the Beach]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0307265439 The Road]].\\"	2001-11-06

Orson Scott Card, who's a Mormon (and who's better known for his science fiction and fantasy novels), creatively fills in the details of the sketchy biblical account and does an impressive job of making some sense of the stranger biblical scenes.

I did one or two lessons per day, and to reinforce what I'd learned, I made flash cards and did some kana drills I found on the Web.

As noted in the book, these fairly simple matters will probably be included in whatever other book you're using to learn Japanese, but I thought they should have been included here to make this course truly &quot;complete.&quot;<br />I can't imagine a quicker or more effective method of learning the kana than this.

The book follows Dinah from her childhood of poverty and misery in England through her involvement in the early Mormon movement in the United States. Card manages to make it seem plausible that a smart, tough, self-reliant woman like Dinah could accept Mormon \\"plural marriage.\\" The one part of her life that I didn't fully understand was Dinah's conversion to Mormonism in the first place, which is, of course, crucial to the story.    I was fascinated by Card's characterization of Joseph Smith. You can't quite decide whether he's a raving egomaniac on a power trip or whether he truly believes he's heard the voice of God and is determined to be faithful no matter how difficult it may be or how crazy God's commands may seem. Or maybe it's some of each. It seems to me that a lot of strong religious leaders are like this, and maybe there's no sure way to tell what's really motivating them. Card also leaves open the interpretation of Dinah's treatment of her children: Is it a painful but necessary consequence of acting faithfully, or an inexcusable abdication of responsibility, or some of each?    \\"Saints\\" is an engaging story and a powerful study of the faithful life.

One species was a sort of sentient seaweed with only long-term memory, until they got hooked up to cybernetic carts that give them mobility and also short-term memory, enabling them to interact meaningfully with other species. So now they look like potted plants in wagons. It's actually another alien species, the central one in the book, that I found the most interesting. I can't say much about them without spoiling of the fun of figuring them out, but they twist our understandings of selfhood, procreation, and the uses of radio.    I also like Vinge's idea of the Zones of the galaxy--the Unthinking Depths, the Slow Zone, and the Beyond--which allow for different levels of technology and consciousness.    I found the second half of the book a little slow and the interstellar email messages kind of hokey and annoying, and I didn't really like the two central adult humans, but I liked the children and the non-humans and especially the relationship between one child and one young non-human.    All in all, this is a fun read with some highly creative ideas.	2001-06-13

But also, I found an odd sort of hope in the way some of the characters dealt with living in the face of impending death. I thought there should have been more social chaos and more extreme insanity and despair as the end came near, but the reactions of this bunch of 1960s Australian middle-class white folks did seem plausible.<br /><br />The movie \\"[[ASIN:B00004SGB5 On the Beach]],\\" starring Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner, is good too and follows the book closely.<br /><br />I also highly recommend Nevil Shute's \\"[[ASIN:0307474003 A Town Like Alice]].\\"	2001-06-02

So she wrote this book for those of us who need help figuring out what we want.  After three introductory chapters, the remaining eleven chapters discuss eleven different forms of resistance to knowing what you want.  I suspect that most readers will, as I did, find a few of the chapters especially relevant and won't bother reading past the opening sentences of some other chapters.<br />I particularly related to the chapters about being afraid to commit to something prematurely, and about not being interested in anything at all.  There's also a chapter for you if you're afraid to take risks; if you're afraid of succeeding and leaving your loved ones behind; if you want too many different things; if you're succeeding spectacularly at something you don't really want; if you feel that what you really want is trivial or unworthy; if you've just been through a big life change and don't know what to do next; if you had a dream but it's become unattainable; if you resist doing anything ordinary or mundane; and if you're trying hard to love something you don't really want.	2001-05-26

I occasionally find this dictionary frustrating when I know only the English version of a term that the editors apparently expect me to know in Sanskrit (e.g., there's no entry for \\"dependent origination,\\" not even a cross-listing sending you to \\"pratitya-samutpada\\"). And there's a strange dearth of information about Korean Buddhism (e.g., no entries for Chinul, Son, or the Chogye Order).

You might want to compare this dictionary with Damien Keown's \\"[[ASIN:0192800620 Dictionary of Buddhism]],\\" which is more up-to-date and has more entries, including more extensive coverage of Western Buddhism, but the coverage of Zen isn't as good.

How refreshing! How helpful!    Medication and therapy can both help, he thinks, but we also need to replace depressive habits with new skills that therapy might not teach. The book focuses on these skills, grouped into five areas: emotions, behavior, thought processes, relationships (focusing on communication), and the sense of self. Lest that sound overwhelming, O'Connor notes that \\"you don't have to do it all at once. . . . Any chapter, any suggestion, may be enough to get you started on a self-reinforcing cycle of healthy behavior.\\"    Other books I've found helpful:  - William Appleton's \\"[[ASIN:0452281644 Prozac and the New Antidepressants]]\\";  - John & Andrea Nelson's \\"[[ASIN:0874778220 Sacred Sorrows]],\\" a collection of essays on a wide variety of approaches to depression;  - Cheri Huber's \\"[[ASIN:096362556X The Depression Book]],\\" on using depression as fodder for your spiritual practice;  - Julia Cameron's \\"[[ASIN:1585421464 The Artist's Way]],\\" which I think is a powerful anti-depression book, even though it's not explicitly about depression and even if you have no particular interest in being an \\"artist.\\"	2001-01-02

If you're new to Zen, you might love this book or you might find it largely incomprehensible, or maybe both. Suzuki makes liberal use of the paradoxical language that is typical of Zen--e.g., \\"For us, complete perfection is not different from imperfection. The eternal exists because of non-eternal existence.\\" If you'd prefer a more ordinary, explanatory style, I recommend Charlotte Joko Beck's \\"[[ASIN:0060607343 Everyday Zen]].\\" If you're looking for practical instruction in Zen meditation, you'll find it in \\"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind,\\" but you might prefer either Philip Kapleau's \\"[[ASIN:0385260938 The Three Pillars of Zen]],\\" which includes more detailed instructions and illustrations of sitting postures, or Cheri Huber's instructional video \\"[[ASIN:B00075K84G The Secret Is There Are No Secrets]].\\"<br /><br />When I first read \\"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind,\\" for a college class on Buddhism, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but I did end up practicing Zen, and maybe this book had something to do with that. For many years, even while living at a Zen monastery, I suspected that a lot of the enthusiasm for this book was an \\"emperor's new clothes\\" phenomenon: a few respected people said it was wonderful, so then everybody said it was wonderful. I figured its aura of profundity was due in large part to Suzuki's congruence with our archetype of mountaintop gurus--the short sentences and limited English vocabulary, and the paradoxical language that sounds deep even though nobody actually knows what the heck it means. More recently, I've come to think that the emperor really does have clothes and that the big issues of human life are hard to talk about without paradox, and this is now one of my favorite Zen books.	2000-11-02

Charlotte Joko Beck was the founder and resident Zen teacher of the Zen Center of San Diego, and \\"Everyday Zen\\" is a collection of her talks. Joko speaks about Zen in an ordinary, conversational, down-to-earth way--as opposed to the paradoxical, poetic, non-logical style often found in Zen--and she explicitly relates Zen to everyday life. For Joko, Zen is about being OK with everything, an OK-ness that does not imply fatalism, passivity, or an absence of feelings. She says: \\"For something to be OK, it doesn't mean that I don't scream or cry or protest or hate it. . . . What _is_ the enlightened state? When there is no longer any separation between myself and the circumstances of my life, whatever they may be, that is it.\\"    While this book is a good one for newcomers to Zen--and for old-timers too--it does not include nitty-gritty beginning instruction in Zen meditation, so for that you'll need to look elsewhere. (I'd recommend the book \\"[[ASIN:0385260938 The Three Pillars of Zen]],\\" the video \\"[[ASIN:B00075K84G The Secret Is There Are No Secrets]],\\" or a Zen center.)    This is not the best Zen book for everyone. When you're in a swamp of existential angst, desperately wanting to know that peace and joy can be found within this fleeting life so full of suffering--exactly the issues Zen addresses--Joko's \\"everyday\\" approach can be exasperating and can seem not to address those issues, and you might prefer \\"[[ASIN:0385260938 The Three Pillars of Zen]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:0834800799 Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]].\\" I appreciate Joko's wariness of leading us astray with images of \\"enlightenment,\\" which is so easily misunderstood as a thing we can achieve that will make our lives perfect at last, but sometimes I want more reminders than Joko offers that our life can be utterly transformed (while still being the same old, imperfect life).	2000-10-27

It is handwritten, with cute illustrations, and the style is conversational and down-to-earth. It is not mainly about how to get less depressed but, rather, about how to suffer less and have more compassion for yourself in the midst of depression, and in the midst of all states of being. While you're very depressed, this book may just scare you and/or piss you off (that was my reaction when I first flipped through it in a bookstore), but I highly recommend it for when you're on the upswing.    Cheri Huber is a Zen teacher, and her approach may especially appeal to folks who practice Zen or a similar form of meditation, but I don't think the words \\"Zen\\" or \\"Buddhism\\" appear anywhere in the text. The last few pages give instructions in a simple form of meditation involving attention to the breathing.    I also recommend John & Andrea Nelson's \\"[[ASIN:0874778220 Sacred Sorrows]],\\" a collection of essays on a wide variety of approaches to depression, including ways of healing depression and also ways of embracing depression and finding meaning in it.

But as it turns out, I do indeed have many \\"obsessive\\" traits in addition to perfectionism. I found the chapter on \\"demand-resistance\\" especially illuminating--although I would've liked more guidance for how to get over it. Other chapters discuss difficulty making decisions and commitments, guardedness, worrying, rigidity, drivenness, and of course perfectionism.    I also recommend Richard Rohr's \\"[[ASIN:0824511859 Discovering the Enneagram]],\\" about a personality-typing scheme in which one of the nine types centers on \\"the need to be perfect.\\" And if you're a perfectionist and a procrastinator about writing, I recommend Anne Lamott's \\"[[ASIN:0385480016 Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life]].\\"	2000-10-13

The sermons are long and dense but carefully crafted, and the theology is powerful and nuanced. Many of the sermons deal masterfully with what I think is one of the toughest but most important juggling acts in Christian theology: maintaining both (a) that our salvation comes entirely through the overflowing grace of God and is in no way merited or achieved and (b) that it is vitally important that we do good, partake of the sacraments, read scripture, pray, and all that good stuff. Other sermon topics include religious bigotry, religious zeal, the use of money, the repentance of believers, and the omnipresence of God.

The six books in the series, plus \\"The Wonder Worker,\\" which might as well be part of the series, move through the 20th century and have overlapping characters, but there's no need to read them in order. My favorites are this one, \\"[[ASIN:0449217280 Glamorous Powers]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0449225550 Absolute Truths]].\\"	2000-08-30

This book helped me to see that religion might also have  something to say to me personally (as did Thomas Merton's \\"[[ASIN:0156010860 The Seven Storey Mountain]]\\").      \\"Varieties\\" is a wonderfully written exploration of the psychology of individual religious experience--whether within or without organized religion--by one of America's greatest philosophers and psychologists. It includes lots of interesting case studies and lots of insight. Major topics: conversion, saintliness, mysticism, and James's illuminating distinction between \\"healthy-minded\\" religion and that of the \\"sick soul.\\"   Fun fact: the panicky, melancholic \\"Frenchman\\" near the end of  the \\"Sick Soul\\" section is actually William James. Also noteworthy: this book was an important influence on \\"Bill W.,\\" co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous.    (Another book I highly recommend on the psychology of religion: Gerald May's \\"[[ASIN:0062505823 Will and Spirit: A Contemplative Psychology]].\\")	2000-08-30

With chapters like \\"Prayer and Aggression\\" and \\"Sexuality  and Prayer,\\" this book gives you permission and encouragement to be  completely honest in prayer, to freely and fully express all that is on  your mind and in your heart.  The approach is psychological, but without  _reducing_ prayer to psychology.      (If, like me, you have serious doubts  that this world full of suffering has a God worth praying to, I also highly  recommend Karl Rahner's \\"[[ASIN:0814624537 The Need and the Blessing of Prayer]].\\")	2000-08-05

It includes every topic you'd want in an introduction: the Sabbath, the High Holy Days, kosher rules, the Torah, the Talmud, Hasidism, Israel, and so forth. Wouk's obvious love of Judaism is contagious, even to non-Jewish readers like me.<br /><br />One warning: When I read this book for a class on Judaism at a Christian seminary, some of the students had trouble with the extravagantly non-gender-inclusive language. I personally can deal with masculine language for all humanity in books more than a few decades old (this was first published in 1957), but when Wouk assumes that the reader is male, as when he refers to the reader's beard (I'm female)--well, it's almost too funny to be offensive.<br /><br />In any case, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />P.S. (eight years later): I assigned this book as the main text on Judaism (along with the Bible) in a college class on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the students really liked it.	2000-08-05

I especially  appreciated Mark Epstein's contribution, \\"The Medicine Buddha,\\" arguing that medication and Buddhist practice can be combined with  integrity. (For those interested in Zen and depression, two other books  I'd recommend are Cheri Huber's \\"[[ASIN:096362556X The Depression Book]]\\" and Philip Martin's \\"[[ASIN:0060654465 The Zen Path Through Depression]].\\")	2000-08-04

Lamott has a gift for looking at the world and especially herself with  meticulous and embarrassing honesty and finally loving and accepting what  she sees.  Readers who are into Zen or a similar spiritual practice will  find inspiration here for their practice as well as their writing.

Clark Strand, a writer and former Zen monk, writes about haiku as a spritual practice of awareness of nature. The book includes many haiku written by Stand and by participants in his workshops.

Boorstein says in the preface that this book was originally going to be \\"an overview of the 'Jewish-Buddhist phenomenon,'\\" but she discovered that people were less interested in the general question of why this was happening than in the personal question of how she could be both a Jew and a Buddhist and whether they could do it too. So she wrote this book instead. And I'm glad she did. I'm a Christian Zen practitioner and really enjoyed and related to Boorstein's experiences and musings.    I also recommend Boorstein's \\"[[ASIN:0062512943 It's Easier Than You Think]],\\" a quirky, anecdotal, practice-oriented introduction to Buddhism.

Some of the stuff about relating to a guru may be justifiably off-putting to many Western readers, but don't let that keep you from seeing all the wonderful teaching in this book. I've read parts of it again and again over the past decade (especially the introduction and the first chapter) as the simple but elusive point has finally started to sink in that spiritual practice is not about getting anywhere or achieving anything.    This book is best for readers who are already involved in Buddhist practice. I also highly recommend Trungpa's \\"[[ASIN:1590302893 The Myth of Freedom]],\\" which is a better place to start if you're new to Buddhist practice, and \\"[[ASIN:1570628726 The Wisdom of No Escape]]\\" by Pema Chodron, a student of Trungpa.	2000-07-28

The book is suitable for readers of any or no religious affiliation who want to learn to meditate, but I think it's even better for experienced meditators who tend, as Strand did, toward an excessively intense and willful approach to spiritual practice. I return to this book when I want to be reminded how simple meditation really is and that it's not about DOing anything.

This distinction has remained central to my understanding of both Buddhist and Christian spiritual practice, giving me some sense of why Zen is always saying that you can't _become_ a buddha because you already _are_ a buddha, and why Christianity is always saying that you can't _earn_ your salvation but need only _accept_ it.

If you think you want to pray but have trouble even beginning because belief in a loving God seems like ludicrously wishful thinking in such a mess of a world, try out this book. Rahner understands suffering, he understands atheism, he understands angst (this book is based on sermons preached in bombed-out Munich in 1946), and yet he dares to be Christian and to pray.

I found this a spiritually nourishing book, particularly Jethro's discussions with Moses about prayer and Moses's advice to Aaron on being a servant of God. Thank you, Orson Scott Card!	2000-07-04

It is also a story about humanity's first contact with intelligent aliens.     If you're interested in this sort of religious issue but aren't into science fiction, don't be scared off by the genre; you might like this anyway. (And I also recommend Susan Howatch's Church of England novels -- not science fiction -- which deal with similar religious themes: confession and forgiveness, priestly celibacy, spiritual guidance, etc.) If you like science fiction but aren't into this sort of religious issue, you probably won't like this book, which isn't that great just as science fiction.    I was hooked from the opening page. I love the premise that the Jesuits mount an expedition to visit our newly discovered sentient neighbors while the U.N. and everyone else is still dithering about what to do. Other reviewers have complained about the unnatural dialogue, but I can't say I noticed. I didn't like the rushed ending, and I didn't like knowing from the beginning what would become of most of the characters, but it's an engaging story anyway. The sequel, \\"Children of God,\\" is pretty good, but I didn't like it as much as \\"The Sparrow.\\"	1998-04-20

Also useful: pictures of meditation postures with questions and answers, and a glossary of Zen vocabulary.    If the stories of people's \\"kensho\\" experiences seduce you into serious Zen practice with a Zen community, well, that's great (and maybe that's why Kapleau included them), but then eventually you'll need to read Trungpa's \\"[[ASIN:1570629579 Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism]]\\" or Joko Beck's \\"[[ASIN:0060607343 Everyday Zen]]\\" as an antidote to your now-warped view of what practice is all about.

This book helped me to see that Dogen may actually deserve his reputation as THE master of Soto Zen.<br /><br />The commentator, Yasutani Roshi, is perhaps best known for his classic introductory lectures on Zen training in \\"The Three Pillars of Zen.\\" If you've ever wondered what the heck you think you're trying to do on that zafu, when the whole point is that you already ARE a buddha, you might find this helpful. I liked Yasutani's attention to the tensions between Rinzai and Soto approaches to Zen (with some pointed scolding of the Soto folks) and the relationship between practice and enlightenment. I highly recommend this for folks who've been practicing Zen for a while and want a taste of Dogen.<br /><br />Another Dogen commentary I highly recommend: Francis Dojun Cook's \\"[[ASIN:0861713176 How to Raise an Ox: Zen Practice as Taught in Zen Master Dogen's Shobogenzo]].\\"	1998-03-25
