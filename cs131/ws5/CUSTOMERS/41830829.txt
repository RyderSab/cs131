US	41830829	R3REHAD61ZB037	0671027387	315416156	Deception Point	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Excellent High Tempo Read	For 500+ pages, Dan Brown's Deception Point keeps you very interested throughout with interesting fact-based data, and extremely clever plot direction. This is overall an extremely successful story that could do no more to capture the reader's attention right from the beginning and throughout. For a layperson who is not directly, or even remotely associated with any of the government agencies writen about, or to the political behavior of real life people in government, this story is truly believable, and strikes both enthusiasm and fear into a readers' minds about how the world is really run.<br /><br />Rachael Sexton is the daughter of the U.S. Senator running for president against the incumbent President Zach Herney. The sitting president is a devout backer of the Space Program, and it seems this trait of his will tank him in the upcomming elections. His achilles heel will be used against him by his own opponent, unless NASA makes a discovery that would make all the money the United States has ever spent on the program worth while. A discovery has been made, and the Senator knows nothing about it.<br /><br />Racheal, the Senator's semi-estranged daughter walks the fine line between working directly under the sitting president, and being the daughter of his opponent. She is the most important piece to both of their campaigns. Does she survive either of them after she finds out what NASA has discovered?<br /><br />You'll definitely enjoy the book, I would suggest it only to people who are intested in the obvious subject matter. I only give this book 4 stars because the plot is very linear. There is only one plot to which all the characters are attached, and the book is virtually played through very simply. Not a bad thing, but not a literary work of art either.	2004-11-02

Books	5	6	6	N	N	Literary Best Buy	You'll not find better literature for this price anywhere else. If you're a fan of Poe's work, then there's probably no reason on earth why you shouldn't own this book. My two favorite sotries are &quot;the cask of amontillado&quot;, and &quot;the black cat&quot;. The introduction is short and informative, and leads perfectly into Poe's work. If you've been made to read any of his work in college or highschool and think you'd like to see more of that genre, you won't be disapointed. There are other collections of Poe's work, but this is an extremely inexpensive alternative to the same great stuff.  The only thing that I truly disliked about this edition is that the actual print is extremely small and not clear at all.	2004-06-18

For those kids who are not interested in reading this is a good choice to help them get interested. This is a classic to which most kids and people for that matter already know the general story. So for kids who are unsure about reading, or feel that they don't always understand what they are reading (for lack of attention) this would be a great book to start them off. This version is complete and unabridged giving the reader the full detail of Bran Stoker's original classic. Cover to cover this is one of the best and most known horror stories ever printed.

Although many premises on which the foundation of this story builds itself, and to which he alludes within his novel are still today of a controversial nature he does a great job of rattling the cage of Christian History. From the birth of Christianity to its modern day state, Brown grips the reader with suspense, mystery  and a great deal of enlightenment throughout this history-unveiling book.<br />Although the premises of the story may not be fully founded, and the facts of history are spread thin with controversy, the overall appeal is good because of the authors ability to continuously affect the reader in a way that most other books cannot.  Dan Brown went out on a limb to write a book that challenges the history of a popular faith and taking this book for what it is, a fiction novelists latest attempt to write a bestseller, it's a very dynamic book that you won't be able to put down.<br />Without getting into any details of the book (as this is a mystery novel that must be experienced without such give-aways) i'll say that the only thing that i did not like about the book was that, as it went on, the chapters seemed to get too short, and scenes jumped around too much. I would prefer a 10 to 20 page chapter that tags you along a story line more than the 2-4 page chapters Brown has opted for.<br />Historically, no matter what faith you believe in, this book is going to make your head turn with his connection of Da Vinci's life and work to the blood line of Jesus Christ Himself. I would recommend this book to those novel-seekers interested in History, Mystery  and Suspense.	2004-04-09

I wrote a review about the first part of this two part series, and i wrote it after having read both books. This book is the second part. I wrote in that review that the book was disapointing because of a few factors. First off, the star trek universe and all of its authors and writers have built such an amazing dreamworld of characters, who's center point is Starfleet and the Federation of Planets. They have, over the span of years, written of their morals and how great a people they are. In this two part series most of what we've known and thought about them is sort of thrown out the door. They are, for the most part of this two book series, the villain. I was disapointed in the first book more than this one. This one at least had content and plot that the reader could follow. It ties up most of the sub-plots, some better written than other, and finally finishes quite well. I found the use of Data, from TNG to be pretty good. I found the use of both plots, Borg Domination of Earth, and Holographic Protest to be good premises for stories. The way in which the protagonists won in the end was a little too easy. Finally i will conclude by saying that the two books are entertaining, and i would suggest them to any voyager fan. I would make note, however, that i felt disapointed with the use of voyagers homecoming. I thought their arrival would be much better and more dramatic than the mini party and bland reciept they were given. I know this is just a book, and just a story about fiction and people that don't exist, but i like the series, and people who followed the series will be disapointed with this story, if only to some degree.	2003-09-15

The novel, like all star trek novels was entertaining. They are all entertaining. Besides this, i had a rough time embracing this as great Star Trek work. This is a two part series (part 1) where voyager is home after the end of the last series. With this &quot;foot in the door&quot; (Voyager getting home) its my opinion that any author should have a field day with any number of plots and topics to cover. I was very disapointed in a few aspects of this two part series. The idea that starfleet would embrace the voyager crew with such little 'to-do', even in the aftermath of a big war with the Dominion is very disapointing. As a viewer and fan of Voyager it was the final victory of getting home to be heralded as heroes that we all wanted to see. As the story unfolds, the author unfolds a sort of sub-plot for each character. Throughout this entire book, i was never quite sure of what the main plot of this story was. Not until the last page. I find it disturbing that a novel in a two part series can not stand on its own as a novel. I think that a book (even if in a series) should be able to stand alone as a full and complete novel, while only giving the reader an itch to want to read the second book. This is by no stretch of the imagination readable without reading the second book. Consider a book with 21 chapters in it. This book is like reading the first 8 chapters. You feel like you totally got ripped off. On the last page, it felt like the story had just finished beginning. It was a big intro to the real story. If you are a major voyager fan you'll find this entertaining. But overall i think you'll find it to be disapointing. I would suggest that you do not buy this book without buying the second one. At 7 bucks each i find i got ripped off. The bottom line is that the two books make up 1 story.	2003-09-15

It's timeless because it has been a big seller ever since it was published 124 years ago. Because the story is rich in character, people from all walks of religion and life can appreciate this story set in a time of global religious turmoil. Ben-Hur is the story of a Jew's life-long quarrel with his counterpart and nemesis Messala, amid the Roman occupation of ancient Palestine and among the rise of the Christian Religion.<br />Brief Synopsis: As childhood friends-become-enemies, Judah and Messala always had a burning desire to over achieve each other. As tensions grew with the end of childhood and the beginning of adulthood, the two parted ways only to meet one day under a very peculiar and dark circumstance. As a Roman Prince strode through the streets on his horse, followed by his royal guards and gang, Judah, on his home's rooftop, came flying out to see what all the hype was about. Upon his looking down at the Prince from the rooftop, Judah could scarce get close enough to the magical prince. As though kicked over by the foot of fate, a parcel of the rooftop was sent tumbling down toward the horseman sending his beast to run amuck. Then Roman Guard, Messala, in his final attempt to spite Judah Ben-Hur, quickly pointed his finger in the direction of the innocent Judah casting a glow of malice over him. Ben-Hur became nothing, and his life was reset anew, forever to surrender his soul to his captors. Now a slave, Judah, of the house of Hur, must redeem his life, and that of his family's name. He must rise above slavery and into poverty where he must begin his life anew. Quick is the rise of a true hero, one who knows defeat but cherishes freedom. Read Ben-Hur to find out how Judah's life long quest of redemption leads to salvation and conversion to Christianity and how the restoration of his name and life comes on the day Christ Himself is crucified.<br />Ben-Hur is the story of freedom, and how quickly it can be torn away from us. This story teaches you that you must forever and always be mindful of, and merit, your good fortune. To those interested in the history of Christ and the religious standoffs of the times, I would strongly suggest reading this novel./>Ben-Hur is the story of freedom, and how quickly it can be torn away from us.

This is the story of Lieutenant HAWK from the Star Trek TNG Borg movie First Contact. This story is set six months prior to the events that took place in the First Contact movie, and center mainly around the life of Hawk, Picard, and Picards two long standing friends. The book uses many references to previous movies, and scenes in episodes from TNG series. I really enjoyed the book because the plot surrounded more than just one person. Something i found a little shallow about the last Trek book i read entitled &quot;Immortal Coil&quot; in which Commander Data is the subject of the entire plot. &quot;Rogue, Section 31&quot; was a fun read, and i would recommend it to anyone into the Next Generation theme, or those of you who may have read other books in the &quot;Section 31&quot; collection. As a pre-requisite, i might suggest watching the episode from the Next Generation in which Picard looses his heart in an a fight with three naussicans. This episode is referred to, and is the basis for much of this books' plot.	2003-09-05

As a pretty avid fan of TNG I have seen probably 90% of the shows, most a few times. I love the show, and movies that have been made about Star Trek and this book is just an extension of that quality i've enjoyed over the years. The book itself, reads really quickly at 330 pages. I read it in 2 days, and i'm not a very fast reader, i just couldn't put the book down. The story is very unique, and as always with Star Trek, very interesting. The characters, and the emphasis in this story on Data's history, are quite believable. The story, after having read it, reminds me more of a Star Trek movie, than just an episode. The only down side to the story that i can think of was that it was purely about Data. The references made in the book (to previous episodes and movies) are what make this really a book written with the true Trekkie in mind. I would reccomend this book to anyone with an interest in TNG.	2003-08-29

Bawlf does a great job of telling the story of the man that first circumnavigated the globe. He tells us of the battles fought, the seamen hanged, the gales that beat down on them, and does it all with extensive use of various resources that seem to have taken a long time to research. This is the first book that I've read on the subject, so I cannot speak of any discrepencies or possible points of conflict with other resources on the subject or times, though I cannot imagine a scenario where such an historian as Bawlf, could lead us to believe that the story he told is anything but the truth. It is with great pleasure that I've learned about the amazing Drake through this easy to follow historical guide. I would reccomend this book to anyone with an interest in nautical history, and also to anyone who's interested in historical piracy because in fact, Drake was exactly that: possibly the most successful and notorious pirate of all time.	2003-08-26
US	41830829	R1QAUCK2E0ELM1	0451207521	583024749	Jackdaws	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A great cat and mouse game.	It seems like Jackdaws is the first book I've read by Follett where the center of the story is WWII. Although I have not read many novels regarding this subject matter I will say that I was very impressed at the objective viewpoint the author had on the war. His characters are not merely good and evil; they are human beings in a war fighting for their lives. The people are doing what they think is necessary to win the war and thus end the war. Each character displays the true human quality that we all have about the natural hate for war.<br />The story is about a Female British Spy named Flick, whose job it is to cripple the communications link between Germany's Rommel and the German forces in occupied France. Without this communications link the occupation would need to route messages by courier thus making it impossible to properly communicate orders, as they need to be given. Flick and her British Superiors have come up with a plan to infiltrate the central communication link in France. The only thing stopping her from severing this link is a determined German operative named Dieter Franck.<br />The beginning grips you with an intense situation in which the British spy is on a clandestine team of spies carrying out a special operation against the Germans communication facility. Present is the handsome Franck who happens to be in the area checking up on German security. From that moment on the two are mingled in a cat and mouse game not so typical of the WWII spy-thriller genre. <br />I recommend reading this book if you are interested in the events leading up to D-day. And have enjoyed Follett's work in the past.<br />Although the reviews make it seem like a book about a bunch of British Female Spies, I tend to disagree. In my opinion the book was mostly focused on the aforementioned characters. Although 5 women accompany Flick, it's evident that she is the story's Protagonist and Franck the Antagonist.	2003-05-17
US	41830829	R11DH8RQNPP12M	0375757325	614019833	Robinson Crusoe (Modern Library Classics)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Powerful Story	The book `Robinson Crusoe' is one of my all time favorite books. I was turned onto classics recently when I started to look into the classics section of the books store. I wanted to know what all the hype was about books and stories such as this one. Being a classic tends to give way to the idea that the book has a lot to offer, and that is no different for `Robinson Crusoe', a remarkable story of remarkable circumstances that present themselves to the main character. Although the story, often dubbed `the story of a man stranded on an island for 26 years', sounds dull and uneventful, nothing could be further from the truth. Those who've never read it refer to it as that, a story of a man stranded on an island for 26 years. Those of us who have read it understand that it's much more than that. This may be the best story ever composed. The swift current of the novel is quick-paced and could include nothing more to keep a reader entertained. <br />Regarding the moral implications such as those of slavery, the novel heavily disfavors the ideas we have in society today by condoning and thinking only once about slavery. I believe this further treats us in a piece of literature that also acts as a diary of times. What better way to tell a story, than to simply tell the truth? And in those times the truth was that slavery was a part of society and nothing more shameful than modern day coffee drinking. It was a business and although unfavorable today, it was the truth of the times. I have the same feeling about the references to religion. Those times were different and act today as a time capsule for readers to understand what things may have been like only 300 years ago. <br />Literally, the novel uses (by modern standards) odd English and can be difficult for novice readers. However, even for a novice reader the novel can be a challenge to learn about how the writers of our past wrote novels. As the reader proceeds through the story, more is understood and eventually the story flows as freely as a morning newspaper. I would encourage users to read this knowing that it is almost three hundred years old, and that the slang is thick and different from ours.<br />The storytelling is nothing short of a masterpiece. The story itself touches down on many aspects of the human condition; hatred, happiness, courage, perseverance, loyalty, love, treachery and friendship. We can all relate at one point or another with Robinson Crusoe. <br />Regarded as possibly the first English novel ever, this tells the story of a man who's found himself alone and shipwrecked on a deserted island; the many years he spends making a new home for himself, the many times he tries to escape his paradise dungeon and the thick courage it took to outlast the immeasurable feat of solitude. This is the story of a man who finds one footprint on a deserted island.	2003-05-13

From all ends of the political and religious spectrum - Follett introduces various characters right in the beginning of the novel with an unlikely meeting of future foes. The story begins at Oxford University in London England, where a group of students participate in political discussions. What they don't know is that their political differences will some day become more than just political differences. Eventually they'll all be at different ends of the race for nuclear weapons in the mid-East. <br />I enjoyed the novel profoundly. It was a very good weekend page-turner, and I would suggest it to anyone who admires Follett's work. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I've read more recent work of his including the Key to Rebecca, the Pillars of the Earth, and A Dangerous Fortune - All three much deserving of 5 stars. Although a great novel, I still must limit Triple to 4 stars because it's not quite on the level of entertainment as those aforementioned. The writing style of Follett is unique and he produces great stories with awesome skill. If you have not read those three novels I've mentioned, please take time to read them. You'll be incredibly entertained if you were to read any of them - with my personal favorite being The Pillars of the Earth.	2003-05-05

At the time of publication Netscape was still as prevalent as IE and hence (should have) made programmers decide to go with another book (to keep a cross browser focus). But now that IE has taken over (at the time of this review) this book can prove quite helpful.<br />I would suggest the book: Beginning JavaScript (by Paul Wilton). This has more in-depth coverage and lots of great examples to get beginners, int, and adv. users moving quick. See that review.	2003-01-09
US	41830829	R1OM5YJY43HYXW	1903450322	421857508	Foundation Actionscript	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Fun book, but that's about it.	You may not want to start out on your Flash adventures here. This book assumes (as well it should) that you know the basics of flash and are well versed in how flash works and what you can do with it.<br />That said: it is an Actionscript book. It SHOWS you how to code some cool games/applications etc. None of which are usefull in business. But i'll say however that i did &quot;grasp&quot; the concepts used mostly because i have a big JavaScript background. With a deep understanding of JavaScript i was able to pickup on all the techniques Sham was using.<br />If you're interested in Actionscript i would suggest getting a book based on Flash MX (rather than flash 5). If you plan to use and deploy movies in flash 5 format, and know some actionscript and want a simple book that SHOWS you how to do things by example then this is your book. This is not by any means an Actionscript Reference. You'd be hard pressed to find more than 15% of flash's true capabilities in this book. It does focus on broad range items that lots of people already know how to do. (You may get as much out of this book as you will by browsing the web to find a bunch of Flash tutorials).<br />Last note. The game Sham writes in the end is really cool. I was able to make a few variations of the same game using the concepts he did. However the beginner will have a tough time understanding as he goes very quickly assuming you understand some things he didn't quite explain.<br />Gave 2 stars because its a bit outdated (using flash 5) and that it doesn't explain the actionscript language so much as it does it for you.	2003-01-09
US	41830829	R15AL34XW7BMHT	0316769495	551899474	Franny and Zooey	Books	5	4	6	N	N	worth a look	Franny 20, Female is distraught about her life. Zooey 25, male is Franny's brother. And although Franny thinks she'll never make it through (what she thinks is a huge crisis), least of all through the help of her Bratty, know-it-all brother; the answers to all her problems have never quite been closer to her than they are now. <br />This book, by the hugely talented Salinger will fill a spot in your heart whether you're the brother, or sister he's writing about. Althoug short, this book touches you unlike any other book can or has. <br />The story is simple, and full of dialogue which, keeps you reading if if not interested. Its a slow rise to a great climactic ending which is absolutly destined to give you a rewarding feeling. At about 200 pages its a quick weekend read.	2003-01-08

I thought it an odd name so i picked it up.<br />When i read the intro (By Mr Raffel) i was instantly sold to buy this book. The fact alone that it was written between 1200 and 1600 years ago should credit this book enough for everyone to want to read it.<br />The story itself is motivating. It really lets you imagine a great warrior who had his priorities straight. Sometimes the most basic story of a hero winning battles will grip your heart and squeeze it with inspiration. I give this 5 stars because it was a really entertaining \\"poem\\" to read. I say poem because it was supposed to be a poem. But fear not; this book reads as a short story, and i would encourage people to read it and have their kids read it (older kids: say 12 and up). Once you understand the story it might be fun for your kids to try it, and you can \\"enlighten\\" them on any points they think they've missed.<br />I wish we knew more about such an awsome tale.<br />I tip my cap to the Unkown Author for giving us a truly beautiful tale of a warrior who knows no defeat, but also knows that all good things must eventually come to an end.<br />As a footnote, I might advise you to purchase the \\"black-covered\\" book with the man in chain-mail. I picked it up at the bookstore (after having read this copy) and it looked a lot more interesting and provocative than mine. In addition to side notes, and footnotes, that version also shows the original text (in old english) and i though that you seemed to get more for just a few extra bucks.	2002-07-23
US	41830829	R12WRQXDVFYH5S	0380733358	153919204	Eye of the Needle	Books	5	2	2	N	N	His best spy book	Ken Follett has done a wonderful job of centralizing the plot of a novel around the life and work of the bad-guy. Rather than write a typical \\"good-guy\\" spy-thriller, he has introduced a whole new view of the spy-thriller. The novel is remarkable and one of my top three favorites produced by Follett. His ability to write a novel about the enemy's number 1 spy was entertaining and, in my opinion, the hallmark of his writing career. <br />Nadel is a ruthless spy. No family no loved ones. Just the way he likes it. It allows him to concentrate on the matter at hand. Killing opposition spies. <br />This was absolutely amazing and a quick fun read. If you have read some of Follett's other books such as \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", \\"Key to Rebecca\\", \\"A Dangerous Fortune\\", then you know what his style of writing is. Although different in content, his style is almost invented within these book covers. If you've read other works of Follett's, then you'll enjoy this book as being on par, but on a different course than those aforementioned.<br />Eye of the Needle is a unique spy-thriller well deserving of 5 stars. I would suggest those books above, along with this one if you're looking for a good weekend/vacation reading. Please see my reviews of the other novels as they may help you to choose which you want to read first. <br />Great Reading!!!	2002-07-19
US	41830829	RXO9NQ4VSLFMC	0871917734	859427720	The Cask of Amontillado (Creative Classic Series)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Amazingly Entertaining	I read this story in college (English 2) and i must say this was probably the best horror story i've ever read. <br />First, i like to forget about the words he uses for a minute to explain that, although magnificently written, i take the story for how it was meant to be interpreted. And it was meant to leave you with a chill, and a feeling of despair that was so violently left in my stomach that i had to read it again and again. <br />I can't wait to be sitting around the camp fire to tell this story.<br />As far as the literary value, i am not shy in saying i didn't understand many of the words, but that's what a dictionary is for, and with the use of both books i came away thrilled with knowing and understanding what is probably one of the best horror stories ever written.<br />The story is a macabre tail of two men, both upper classmen mindful of their positions in society. One of them; seemingly distraught over past wrongs done, strives to avenge his house by comitting one brutal act. His prey however, does not know his fate until it has met him alone, and face to face...<br />Big Cheers to Poe for an amazingly entertaining story.	2002-07-15
US	41830829	RIQQW2VEOJZ3U	0451173139	464602444	Night Over Water	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Entertaining as ever	I could not put this book down. The entertainment value was in the setting of the book. A plane... A \\"titanic\\" type aircraft. Only for the rich, one of the first Trans-Atlantic flights... What a story.<br />I think the value of Ken Follet is in the diversity of his books. Yes they seem to follow the path of \\"SPY thrillers\\" but none are EVEN REMOTELY close to being similar in any way... (I've only read half his books so far though).<br />But i just want to say that the book was very entertaining, and has, in my opinion, kept up to the standards that Follet has created for himself.<br />I will say this as my only negative critisism: The book did jump around a slight bit, (Not that it was hard to comprehend, but you felt like you wanted the part of the story to continue, before he whisks you away to a different sub-plot). Also i felt slightly impatient at parts of the book, and just wanted the story to \\"wrap up!\\"... But in time it does, and is well worth the \\"build up\\".<br />Honestly. Who can write a better book about a single flight??? He could write a masterpiece with only a square closet as the setting, I'm sure of it...<br />I would call this book : killer!	2002-07-12
US	41830829	R3R487Y6DF80N9	0440217490	233998989	A Dangerous Fortune	Books	5	5	5	N	N	My Favorite book... for a week.	I read this book three weeks ago. I have since just finished reading \\"The pillars of the earth\\".<br />I might someday be able to look back on the past few weeks as the best weeks of my life as far as reading goes.<br />The book was by far the best book, and story i had ever read, and i was convinced that it would be the best i would ever read. But then i picked up \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\"... I almost wish i read a crappy book after \\"ADF\\" because i didn't have enough time to really enjoy the \\"thought\\" of the book in my head before \\"Pillars\\" came along and stole the show...<br />I truly would compare the experience of reading these books in that order to the following:<br />Watching a U2 Concert, followed the next day by a Frank Sinatra Concert (BOTH LIVE OF COURSE).<br />The story is totaly believable. The time period is interesting, the financial part of the story, (specially relating to the times) takes you for a ride.<br />The people in it, good and bad, are totaly dynamic, and it doesn't matter who it is, theres a character for everybody! Everybody i know has a different \\"favorite character\\" from this book. <br />I'm gonna stop right there, because i can't really describe how good it was.	2002-07-12

It is truly ONE ENTERTAINING BOOK.<br />And a last point: The book has no \\"prolonged\\" slow areas. He slows down like a roller coaster does just to calm you down moments before whisping you through another loop.<br />I would call this \\"great\\".<br />Five Stars	2002-07-12
US	41830829	R1JTDYHGUVEIGI	0451204530	356134546	Code To Zero	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Enjoyable	The book is a great read. Yeah i agree with many people that it wasn't exactly the \\"MASTERPIECE\\" people have come to expect from Ken Follet, but i supposed that's waht makes his other books, MASTERPIECES... (They can't all be masterpieces)<br />First i sort of agree with a Reviewer who wrote \\"I was appalled at all the anachronisms and mistakes\\"... and i would like to add another one i didn't quite see here (yet). Doesn't Billie at one point say something like... \\"nope, that's all she wrote!\\"... Is that in reference to the \\"Murder She Wrote\\"... Maybe i'm wrong but was \\"Murder She wrote\\" around in 1958???<br />I hope i don't sound like i didn't like the book. It was realy entertaining, and although at some points you did have to \\"swallow\\" what he was saying just for the story to continue, it was thick and hard at times... (LOTS of luck for one person in just 48 hours).<br />One thing i think that i can bring to this review table that i don't think i've read anybody say is that i think this book would (or could possibly have been) one of those \\"Typical Follet\\" books, (like needle, pillars, rebecca) if the story ended and Anthony was the good guy, and that Luke was in fact the bad guy (as Anthony was maintaining).<br />He had me convinced that Anthony was the bad guy far before it said it in black and white, so my normal thinking was : well, if he's got me so convinced that Anthony is the bad guy, and that luke is the good guy, then it must be the opposite...<br />I don't know: when the story ended, and i never saw that page turn saying \\"Anthony was right all along... it had been Luke who was the spy!\\"... That would have turned stuff around!<br />All together there are 3 stars because its a VERY entertaining book. And that's why he wrote it. Lost a star because its not a masterpiece, and one for all the crap i had to swallow to get through it, and so only those masterpieces should get the 5.<br />One last point: I dind't even bother to read the \\"Rocket\\" story that preceeded every chapter (pertaining to 1958). I waited until the last 35 pages to read back through, so it was fresh in my memory when the rocket actually launched... And i think that made it better...	2002-07-12
US	41830829	R1VIN4AUN664LJ	0449225151	474485511	Place Called Freedom	Books	5	6	9	N	N	Instant Fan	I read this book when i was 17 a little while ago.<br />I had never read his masterpieces, but i had a friend who raved about him, so i went to the book store, and found this one. It was the only book by Ken Follet that the store carried at the time. That one book instantly turned me into a Major fan of Ken Follets.<br />At that point in my life, i hadn't much read, and i wasn't much into reading, but i picked that book up and read through it in very little time (for me at that age) and it was amazing! If you want to get somebody into reading, who doesn't much like to read, then this book will jump start them!<BR>(i agree that it should be somewhere around the PG-13 though).	2002-07-12
US	41830829	R23UMB9HV2YSPO	0451166892	193551147	The Pillars of the Earth: A Novel (Kingsbridge)	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Absolutely Amazing	The book (when you first pick it up) seems big, and long. But trust me, read it, and you'll find that you wish it was 2000 pages and not just 1000 pages.<br />I read a lot of his books, and was almost sure that the book \\"A Dangerous Fortune\\" that Ken Follet wrote was going to be the best book i've ever read (and i thought it would be that way for a long time) Until I read this book. (it was the very next book i read).<br />This book goes through the entire life time of about 6 to 10 major characters, and has so many interesting plots interwoven that you never know what the next page will question or answer...<br />In an amazing period of history. It truly allows you to understand life back then (as seen by Follet) and lets you explore the thought that things may actually have been the way he writes. <br />I'll give my stars like this:<br />1 star: Character development was amazing. You always knew who that person was (without him saying the name) just by the the characters characteristics.<br />1 star: I can't say the word plot without adding an (s) at the end... This story has so many PLOTS, some that at first, just seem like the story telling of an author who \\"over details\\" his stories, but soon you find that its not just details, but a new plot that will tie up at some point (not necessarily at the end).<br />1 star: totaly interesting. This reminds me of Shakespeare. How to make a book (story/play) that everyone loves. The human condition is expressed in so many ways, that everyone has fun reading this. There are awsome wars, major trickery, lots of love, friendship and deceipt. There is sadness, happiness, frustration that we can all relate to. This book simply put: lacks nothing.<br />1 star: Not keeping with the traditional... \\"Antagonist wins first, Hero wins last!\\" theme. This truly spins so many loops you don't know where they start or end.<br />1 star: Ending. The ending of this book has to be one of the best story endings i've ever heard of. When you think that he's gonna ease you down lightly after the dust has settled, the last page is a deuzy.. (don't read it t'll the end).<br />5 stars...<br />If you don't mind a few details read on:<br />In this story the following happens:<br />1: A baby boy is left to die in the forest only to become the heir to the bishops throne.<BR>2: A Saint is proclaimed<BR>3: A Cathedral burns, crumbles, and is rebuild three times.<BR>4: Countless murders, and many more conspiracies.<BR>5: A seemingly retarted boy who grows up in the forest with his mother builds the Cathedral of his dreams (and the dreams of others).<BR>6: A town is burned.<BR>7: The throne of England is in tireless dispute.<BR>8: An Earl is sent to jail to die, and his son and daughter left penniless at ripe ages end up regaining the earldom.<BR>9: A woman controls the Earldom.<BR>10: A man and woman love each other for approx 12 years without being allowed to sleep in the same house.<BR>11: A Genuine Preist is the center of the entire story, from the death of his parents at the age of 6 to his burned cathedral to his burned town to the death of his Archbishop, to the revolution and crusade of Saint Thomas.	2002-07-10
