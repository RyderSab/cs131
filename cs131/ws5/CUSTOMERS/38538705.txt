As a new knitter, I wanted to learn about other knitters and their thoughts and ideas. I love reading chicklit novels and this book fit right in! This book provided me just that and more! I received great \\"knit-bits,\\" if you will, about the history and the present day knitting. I also found the diary-style writting to be quick and more fun! Wonderful for knitters new and experienced!!	2005-06-11

It is light and quick to read with relatable characters. Highly recommended if you like reality television shows!! The author lets us in on the behind the scene scoop of reality shows while at the same time dealing with true marriage life issues. While Sarah discovers herself, I found my own eyes being opened. When O'Connell writes about the \\"currency\\" of saying \\"I love you\\" and about attraction, it's really good -- a helpful reminder for those of us who are married.<br /><br />I'm left wondering ... will there be a sequel that will be based upon the show airing?	2005-04-28

It is a combination of Shopaholic and Motherhood with a twist. What a great idea!! The story and character lines were written so well, I felt like I was actually shopping along with them. I completely related to Kate, she is almost exactly like me. Great novel with a surprise twist ending that brings everything to a COMPLETE full circle and opens your eyes.

The characters ALWAYS have great chemistry between each other and alot of wit. But, it seems as though the series may be dwindling down. It is getting really monotonous. Once I read a few pages, I guessed the story-line was the same as the others... nerd likes girl, girl dislikes nerd. Something happens to girl, nerd saves day and they live happily ever after.<br /><br />I can only hope that a different outline begins to form for this series or I will be getting these books from the library or not read them at all.	2005-03-28

This book wasn't thought of as being done in short stories when purchased. I was highly pleased though! Almost every story ended up having a little piece of me in it... either something I had once done, same situation happened to me, same scenario. You get the picture. I completely related to this book. Not only did each and every author achieve a portion of me within their novelettes, but also they gave me a chance to branch out to other writing styles and new authors. I HIGHLY recommend this book!! It truly makes a person understand that everything happens for a reason.... and leaves you feeling like a new person inside and out.	2005-01-26

The story is well plotted, and the pace never lets up.  It never looses sight of the fact that it's a murder mystery first; the humor never gets in the way of the story.

From the moment the title jumped out at me with a chuckle, I knew I would love this book! I just didn't realize how much! I read this book within 4 days.

I was anxious to start reading! Now that I am done, I am in awe. This book was not what I expected! I figured it would be mostly chikclit-esk, but with a vampire lead... nope! You really have to be more than 100% into vampire legends and Buffy to like this book. I felt it went into too drastic of details when Betsy died (she says, \\"I felt a tremendous pressure, all over my body upon impact of the car crashing me into a tree. I heard everything break. I heard my own skull shatter-it sounded like someone chewing ice in my ear.\\"). This was too detailed for my liking and way more language than all chicklit put together ever had. I can also state that I didn't like the authors' sense of humor. There were only 3 small parts that I chuckled to myself on, and even now I can't remember what they were (if that tells you anything). It was a struggle for me to finish it. Jokes like calling Sinclair \\"Sink Lair\\" were not funny to me the first time, and by the tenth, well, I was nauscious and annoyed.	2004-10-13

This book is about what to do when you've already found Mr. Right. . . and life still isn't quite what you expected. I really liked the fact that the main character (Clara) isn't skinny, but an average slightly over-weight woman ~ one of the funniest and most true-to-life characters ever written..

As with the previous book, I found that the humor and the characters drove the story for me even more than the mystery. While the reader probably wouldn't care to socialize with most of those who populate this tale, it is undeniable that they are realistic. It's a complicated plot but Evanovich handles it very well and with considerable wry humor. She's also very good at delineating the scarier characters and assorted sociopaths who crop up. What I want to know is, why hasn't there been a movie made from this series?	2004-09-01

I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did, in fact it's totally not something I would usually pick up at all. I'm not sure why I did except that I love the show, Raymond, and I love the cover of the book... and it was a Kelly Ripa pick. Her honesty about herself and others was very refreshing. If only other movie stars were as honest.<br /><br />I enjoyed Heaton's breezy writing style and her common-sense approach to both acting and parenting. I thought it was refreshingly honest; touching at times, and at other times, laugh-out-loud funny. As someone who loves \\"Everybody Loves Raymond,\\" I can say that, frankly, I watch it mostly for Patricia Heaton; as wonderful as the entire cast is, I think she is the funniest. So, I was glad to see that Patricia Heaton is as funny and honest in real life as her character. Patricia is a down-to-earth woman who happens to live in la-la land called Hollywood.	2004-08-27
