Mangarella for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />You know you're reading a world class thriller when the opening pages begin with the fall of the angels from Heaven and the unleashing of evil on the world. But, make no mistake, this is not an other-worldly novel because renowned author John Connolly delivers a very modern story in The Black Angel. This is detective Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker's fifth appearance since Mr. Connolly introduced him in Every Dead Thing, the book where Charlie Parker lost his young wife and child to murder thus transforming him into tortured yet brilliant soul.  <br /> <br />Charlie Parker's days are rooted within the death of his wife and daughter. Every breath of his existence and each new case he tackles are stained with a smear of sacrificial blood. He'd had an argument with his wife, walked out of the house and spent a few hours perched on a barstool while his family was slaughtered in the safety of their own home. By the time he's sucked into the \\"missing persons\\" case that is the catalyst for The Black Angel, he's a man possessed with indelible pain capable of delivering a brutal justice. He has remarried and has another beautiful wife and child, a scenario that not only frightens him because of the tragic past but intensifies his visions of his dead wife and daughter, instilling him with a sense of betrayal. He's guilty of not being there to protect them and, later, of remarrying following their deaths. If he thought he was visiting every level of hell before The Black Angel, Charlie Parker's search for a missing prostitute locks him into a centuries old battle with evil itself, the fallen angel.  <br /> <br />Alice was abducted by the fallen angel because her last client owned a missing artifact crucial to the spreading of evil. The streetwalker's trail leads Charlie Parker through the underside of New York, to a multiple homicide near the Mexican border and back through the centuries to Sedlec, a small Eastern European town where evil came to dwell in 1421 and then forward to 1944 and the massacre at a French monastery. Charlie searches not only for the missing girl but for The Evil itself, fully cognizant that The Evil is seeking him out in ways too horrible to imagine. Any reader that rides shotgun with Charlie Parker on this case is going to gaze into tombstone eyes and wonder whether the fallen angels were really driven from Heaven in disgrace or if they, insanely, were escaping goodness for the hellish comfort of evil.  <br /> <br />The Black Angel is the first John Connolly novel I have reviewed. In an effort to catch up with the world through Charlie Parker's eyes, I bought the first novels and spent time becoming acquainted with Parker, his visions of his dead wife and child and the other recurring characters. I really wanted to answer the question: \\"What kind of writer opens a modern detective story with the fall of the angels at the beginning of time?\\"  <br /> <br />I didn't wait long for the answer.  <br /> <br />John Connolly is an extraordinary writer that can seamlessly switch voice and point of view without interrupting the story flow as perceived by the reader. His characters are sharply, almost acidly drawn. His research, as well as the incredibly lean prose that carry this compelling plot, possess a grace of clarity and the depth of the unknown. John Connolly is very much his own man on the page because he's a risk taker unafraid of tossing the dice with tortured characters and diverse plot lines. He is honest with his villains, a point many writers miss. He never gives lip service to evil by portraying cardboard cutout bad guys. He brings you face to face with evil until The Black Angel boils to explosion.  <br /> <br />John Connolly's The Black Angel should be on the \\"must enjoy\\" list for any reader searching for a solid, superbly researched detective story. Even more so, his work should be on the \\"must read\\" list for aspiring writers who want to see howexcellence in craft can reside between the covers of a book.  <br /> <br />	2005-07-21

Reviewed by Joanna Pearson for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Foreign travel is about learning to exist in a dreamy state of in-between-ness. Unknown and ungrounded, you wander through strange environs seeing strange faces, and yet the ever-resourceful mind manages to seize upon vague familiarities, constructing a hybrid place that has the eerie quality of a dreamscape. So we find our main character, Jenny, on a cruise ship in China in Michelle Richmond's debut novel Dream of a Blue Room. Tense and insomniac, Jenny has traveled here on a dual mission: to resolve her collapsing marriage one way or the other, and to scatter the ashes of her murdered childhood best friend. As in all good stories that unfold on a plane, train, bus, or ship (with a nod to the Hitchcockian principle), Jenny soon finds her task complicated by the pull she feels towards Graham, a fellow traveler she meets who has his own reasons for making this voyage.  <br /> <br />Redmond excels in conjuring that state of heightened, dream-like awareness fueled by lack of sleep and periods of intense emotional stress. Her deft descriptions of the Chinese landscape and Yangtze serve as a context for Jenny's extended meditation on her own riverside childhood in Alabama and the history of her failing marriage. The two settings and time periods are ambitiously and successfully interwoven, much to Redmond's credit. She is as en point in her descriptions of Chinese river dolphins, funeral ceremonies, and elderly tea shop ladies as she is in her descriptions of tubing, Sunday School, and watermelons in Mobile. Much more than travel fiction, this is instead a story of growing up as an outsider in the South, revealed through contrast-like looking at the negatives of a series of photos in order to see what you couldn't have noticed otherwise. In this way, China triggers a reflection on Jenny's life back home, proof of the idea that one understands home the best when away from it. We realize very quickly that Jenny's relationship with the murdered Amanda Ruth was more than a mere friendship. Redmond beautifully describes the intimacy, both physical and emotional, between two girls during the pivotal period of late adolescence, as well as the grinding forces of Southern culture and religion that threatened this intimacy.  <br /> <br />For the most part, Redmond's prose has a lovely lyricality. She is at her best when describing situations with clarity and simplicity-she has a keen sense of place, an eye for details like how the raindrops fall at a particular instant. Redmond is a sensual writer and on occasion, her writing can veer towards the overripe, particularly when describing erotic moments. There could have been fewer oversignified descriptions of sex, and the book would have been none the worse for it. Throughout most of the novel, however, Redmond's touch is far subtler, allowing a memory of a summer afternoon in a boathouse or a Chinese funeral procession to do no more symbolic load bearing than warranted.  <br /> <br />As the cruise ship eases down the river, the reality of Jenny's ending marriage becomes apparent even as her relationship with newcomer Graham rapidly progresses. It is through this new, albeit short-lived relationship with Graham and the drastic act he requests of her that Jenny is ultimately able to exit her suspended state. With the slow build-up of a mystery, the exquisite pain of a coming-of-age novel, the masterful images of a travel writer, and a darkness that is true to the Southern Gothic, Dream of a Blue Room is a work of wonderfully chimeric form. And through this, a novelistic form that skillfully defies a single genre, Redmond, quite fittingly, tells the story of a woman finding her way out of the boundaries of singular categories, out of limbo, out of the in-between.  <br /> <br />	2005-07-21

Reviewed by Leigh Newman for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Imagine a father who returns home after four years in prison for gambling, only to drink himself into a stupor on a hourly basis, break the heart of a lonely waitress, and sponge off his grown-up children. In your average first novel, that father's story would be told from the perspective of his children who, let's just say, half-love, half-hate, hate-fear the guy, but come to some kind of tidy understanding with him. In Lisa Selin Davis's first novel, expect nothing of the kind. In fact, prepare yourself for a complicated, ambiguous portrait of a man, told by that man, with such a depth of understanding that it approaches an almost Jamesian knack for psychology.  <br /> <br />With every line, Davis is Belly-a middle age ex-con who just never figured out how to do the right thing in life. Belly covers for his Mafia bosses, only to find that they have no intention of rewarding him for his silence. Belly cheats on his wife with an opportunistic fortune-hunter who steals his money, and, even after the fact, longs for her to return. Belly fights in bars, hates gay people, and realizes \\"his oldest grandson was exactly the kind of boy he'd pick on back in junior high.\\"  <br /> <br />Of course, it is remarkable that petite, educated, bohemian, thirty-something Davis can assume the life of character so different from her. But essentially, all this proves is that Davis has the imagination and talent to write beyond the expected confines of the memoir-novel. What's more impressive is what she does with this character. Belly isn't a good guy. Further, he's bad guy. When his waitress girlfriend, Maybelline, tries to snuggle with him after making love, all he thinks is \\"What is the bare minimum I have to do to get this girl again?\\" Later in the book he realizes that Maybelline is \\"the kind of girl he took to family events, to places where he could show her off but might not have to talk to her. A filler...a way to get other women to pay attention to him.'  <br /> <br />Davis doesn't soften Belly by making him a bumbling failure, either. She lets him live and think and be hard, which in the hands of a lesser artist, might alienate a reader over time. In this case, though, Belly becomes human via his grief-his buried grief that surfaces here and there, sometimes over his own behavior, sometimes over the death of his young daughter. It's this sense of sadness and honesty, combined with Belly's almost-delusional dreams of reinvention that bind us to him. In a larger sense, we end up hoping and feeling for the fictional life of someone who, in real life, we might detest.  <br /> <br />Therein lies the conflict-and the larger, subtextual questions of the book. How can we understand our enemies? How can we love them, and hate them-and love them? Through this moral maze, Davis also manages to frame larger social issues. Belly returns to the city of Saratoga, a town which, when he left was a smalltime racing bust town. Now it's both a land of $5 Euro-coffees and a land of cut-price American chain stores-the quintessential national paradox that bewilders even those of us in real life, who have watched this same sychoprenic change in the landscape unfold over the years.  <br /> <br />Belly, not surprisingly, is confused and enraged. And with him, the reader begins to long for the days of dive bars and 80's coke parties, back when downtown \\"main street\\" was depressed and dumpy, but the functioning, authentic heart of a town. This is an interesting point at which to arrive. Many of us might despair over the strip-mall landscape of the suburbs. But then again, who would exchange that for a seedy recessionville? A former student of urban planning, Davis places these larger social issues of economics and class into the novel with a light, subtle touch-a quality which characterizes her linework as well.  <br /> <br />Stylistically, this novel is simply and straightforwardly written-few metaphors, a terse, contemporary diction, the voice of a white, small-town American male. Yet there is a grace to it, evident in such building phrases as, \\"Everything that happened happened long ago, twenty pounds ago, two girlfriends ago, a hundred thousand gray hairs ago.\\" At times, this phrases are extended and expanded into an almost incantatory paragraphs, such as when Belly sleeps with the waitress Maybelline, thinking that \\"Of he closed his eyes, if he kept his eyes closed, yes, it wasn't Maybelline, it was Loretta. It was Lorettta, it was the first time, it was War Bar in its heyday, there was music, there was the music of murmuring and bass beat and that reassuring scent of stale beer.\\"  <br /> <br />Other times, Davis uses even more subtle techniques, inserting unexpected verbs into a sentence. For example, Belly \\"rescues\\" two remaining beers \\"strangled\\" in plastic. Later, after stealing a fifty dollar bill from his daughter, he lets it \\"brew\\" in his wallet. The technique not only works to create a fresh way to describe the ordinary, it also taps into the larger themes of the book-Belly's alcoholism and numbness.  <br /> <br />Towards the end of the book, Davis describes a girl's Walkman music as \\"it bled out the tiny headphones.\\" Music bleeding out headphones just feels real here-the authentic word for overheard, headphone music. And here, too, Davis is playing with language, using the verb \\"bled\\" to indicate the violence to come in the scene, during which Belly assaults and considers raping a young girl who is wearing his dead daughter's sweater. This is sophisticated language work that in the hands of less controlled writer, could turn into a bunch of cheap, obvious puns. Here, the layered meanings deepen the text.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, Belly is a novel of redemption. But like so many other aspects of the book, this redemption is ambiguous. Yes, Belly agrees to fill out an application at Wal-Mart, which might be considered comic, except that his decision appears to signal his willingness to provide for his family and re-enter society, to somehow atone for his actions. Then again, his decision might just be another late-night grope at improvement that he'll never follow through on. Regardless, Belly's decision does say something about 21st -century America, that the big redemption in a person's life is a Wal-Mart application. And that's not comic. That's dark and bitter, sad and scary-and true.  <br />	2005-06-23

It's true we don't talk about our friend break-ups like we dissect and overanalyze our relationships with significant others. Typically, when I'm asked about someone who's no longer in my life, I say that we had a \\"falling out\\", that it's \\"complicated\\" - what the editors echo in their foreword. In her introduction, Francine Prose remarks: A number of these pieces deal with the ways we form youthful friendships at a time when we ourselves are only partly formed, and still see our friends as mirrors in which we desperately hope to glimpse a sharper and clearer, or simply more interesting image of ourselves. From twenty finely assembled writers, we learn motley tales: from devastating falling-outs to the subtle shifts and mistakes that could dissolve a life-long friendship. Friendships splintered by racism, envy, varying political beliefs, death, and the sheer reality of growing apart.  <br /> <br />In Helen Schulman's heartbreaking \\"First in Her Class\\", teacher/student barriers dissolve when an unlikely, but passionate friendship is struck between a new creative writing professor and her twenty-five year old student, Leigh, who had that \\"fresh earnest American prettiness\\", but would die before her twenty-eighth birthday of cancer. Leigh is resilient, ferociously independent, striving to bear her sickness alone, without the help of her family until the very end. Time lived becomes extraordinarily precious as the two form an intense union, frenetically discussing writing, art and private personal tragedies. Ultimately, we discover how death undoes the bonds of that friendship and leads to betrayal.  <br /> <br />Envy pervades a disquieting relationship between two twenty-something's in Nuar Alsadir's \\"Want\\" A once attention-grabbing, capricious, Ava soon reveals a more complicated, sinister agenda - coveting everything in her best friend's life, from shoes to boyfriends to a red leather jacket, Ava is likened to Tom Ripley (The Talented Mr. Ripley). Alsadir artfully navigates identity constructs, revealing through a perfectly paced narrative, how imitation (which contrary to popular belief isn't always the sincerest form of flattery) and want (defined as to desire, and to lack), can severely ruin a friendship.  <br /> <br />What are the limits of a friendship? How far can one tread on that precarious balance beam of utter betrayal and a fleeting infidelity? Kate Rophie's \\"Torch Song\\" scrutinizes that sudden physical impulse in an age when people didn't belong as absolutely to other people...There was a kind of fluidity to our world. Two outsiders cling together in an exclusive Portland prep school, vehemently plotting their escape to New York, a city which has become a \\"kind of Jerusalem\\", but uncover how quickly their friendship withers upon their arrival in the big city in Emily White's standout, \\"Shelter\\". Immersed in the ecstasy, gay-clubbing frenzy of Chelsea, Raymond discovers a world of beautiful gay boys loud and proud, and suddenly his best friend Emily has lost her luster, perhaps serving as a constant reminder of the broken home left behind, while Emily spends her time with a forty-three-year-old failed writer who talks big but amounts to very little. White depicts the painful progression of her loss, how she found herself ostracized and even ridiculed by her once closest ally, who is more than happy to lose himself in this new lifestyle.  <br /> <br />Many of the stories in the anthology detail how death and severe illness could also serve as the grim reaper of a friendship - ushering in those uncomfortable silences, awkward condolences and relationships that simply cannot survive these searing tragedies. Fast, furious friends as Swarthmore freshman, writers Emily Chenoweth \\"Heather\\" and Heather Abel \\"Emily\\", orbited around each other, they were \\"two girls dancing and singing and drawing and learning Foucault and talking about boys, in code, all inside a soap bubble. In striking companion stories, we capture a rare and honest glimpse of how a mother's death dramatically alters their carefree world, rendering them vulnerable, hurt and angry. With death comes grief, and the necessity of affection, sympathy and companionship - all the markers of a good friendship - multiples, and the demand for these things, while two women are forging their identities, can be all-consuming and exhaustive. The companion pieces are a heartfelt call and response to one another, a painful duet of regret. In the end, Chenoweth writes, my love for Heather was a piece of glass in my heart, it hurt every time I moved. <br /> <br />The stories within The Friend Who Got Away: 20 Writers Tell the True Stories behind Their Blow-Ups, Burnouts, and Slow Fades eschew all the stereotypes of catty, battling gals, yet the tales told never border on sentimental, instead they stew in that dark, middle place where former friends quietly ghost and women courageously try to reconcile their losses.  <br />	2005-06-13

Mangarella for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Josie And Jack is one of those rare tales that seduces the reader from the first page. You find yourself slowly drawn into the relationship between sixteen year old Josie and her older, protectively scheming brother Jack. The sensual tightrope they share transcends brother and sister and is amply strengthened by the fact that they are left alone together most of the week by their brutal, absentee father, Raeburn. Raeburn is an aging college professor with a disdain for newer, slicker forms of education but that doesn't stop him from using that old time knowledge as a mallet on his son and daughter. But he only uses it because he can. Because that's his way of being their father, of filling a huge void that neither Josie nor Jack want filled. They are better off alone together and use every moment to their advantage. When Raeburn cooks up a plan to sexually implicate his teaching rival with a co-ed's false complaint, Jack foils the scheme which results in Josie being left alone while her brother flees for several months. Raeburn is an emotional savage who delights in force feeding the \\"relevant facts of the world\\" to Josie. She can explain relativity but has trouble ordering a cheeseburger, or talking about the weather.  <br /> <br />Jack spends a couple months on the road but eventually returns to liberate his sister. He also liberates a few valuable household furnishings that can be easily fenced. Josie isn't very thrilled that her beloved Jack has lived the last few months in the arms of various women. She's even less ecstatic to share a roof with Jack's current flame, Becka, a stripper he met in a tattoo parlor.  <br /> <br />Jack and Becka don't last very long, mostly because Jack is sensually bound to Josie. They find themselves back on the road, ending up in Manhattan where they meet Lily while trying to con a cashier. Lily is wealthy and thinks nothing of taking Jack and Josie into her incredibly well appointed apartment. Lily and Jack become lovers. Josie waits for him in her own bed after Lily leaves to go about her day. Jack thinks nothing of sexually balancing Lily and Josie, almost like Josie is the climax to whatever he begins with Lily.  <br /> <br />Lily easily suspects Jack and Josie and, at first, really doesn't care very much. Her resentment for Josie grows slowly but viciously. What Lily doesn't realize, what none of her friends that encounter Jack and Josie grasp is the depth of their fire against the rest of society. A furnace stoked over the years by Raeburn who led them into the no man's land of intellectual superiority. Both Jack and Josie truly believe they are superior to everyone they encounter. But they wield their cutting edge emotions very differently. Jack brewing violence. Josie painting herself into a corner of illogical logic based upon her feelings for Jack. And it's this confrontation that brings this novel to a shattering end.  <br /> <br />I'm very much reminded of Meyer Levin's novel Compulsion, based on the 1924 Loeb - Leopold case where a pair of upper class college students felt they were intellectually superior enough to commit the perfect murder. Author Kelly Braffet's slow, careful unwinding of the character and personalities of Josie and Jack gives us a more modern peek into the minds of two \\"intellectually superior\\" children playing at life until someone bleeds. Oddly, no matter how superior they feel, they need one another to survive. Ms. Braffet's novel is not only thriller paced; she provides the depth, through Josie's eyes, to bring the reader to the window ledge of Josie's decision. A precipice where she can't step backward into the fire or forward into the abyss.  <br /> <br />Josie And Jack is a must read.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-01

Reviewed by Camille-Yvette Welsch for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />As a reader of chicklit and a feminist, I often find myself torn between the fun of a quick, fluffy read and utter annoyance with relentlessly trendy female protagonists who can only succeed with the aid of a man and a limitless Visa. Shaking Her Assets is a pleasant surprise in a world where chicklit tends to follow an all-too familiar formula: Girl loses everything: glamorous New York job, bad boyfriend, self-respect. She then attempts to find the one true job, the one true love, and the self-respect via her new lover. Why can't women succeed and gain self-respect without the new romantic interest? Why does her strength have to be directly related to her happiness in love? Why can't she be happy in her life-and then find love?  <br /> <br />In Shaking Her Assets, Rachel finds herself suddenly fired from her high-end writing job, then dumped by her boyfriend of two years, thereby following the formula, at least at the beginning. Miserable, she visits her best friend, Ben-who, refreshingly, is straight but still able to comfort without ulterior motives. They brainstorm the plan that launches Rachel as an applications editor for students seeking admission to MBA programs. Though initially a joke (and it remains one for Ben until Rachel sets him straight), the project blooms into a full-grown business while Rachel works as a temp. As she struggles-and succeeds-in building her business and dealing with her father's cancer, a stocky, cubicle-next-door guy enters her world, becoming first her new best pal and confidante, then, much later, her love interest. Zach takes her life and chronicles it in his online comic book site, turning Rachel into a She-Ra, capable of foibles and triumphs great and small. Epstein and Kaplan break away from the chicklit formula because the majority of the book finds Rachel making her way into the world of business, actively seeking clients with flyers and handouts, making excel spreadsheets of upcoming projects, researching business schools, and creating a client base. Only after she has succeeded does she get together with Zach who is also fighting to establish himself.  <br /> <br />The writing is lively and engaging, and often quite funny. Rachel and Zach begin handing out flyers outside a business school and Rachel sights her prey, a dragon lady in a suit:  <br /> <br />\\"And why do you think I'd need advice?\\" she says, unenthused.  <br /> <br />I want to say, Because you're a huge bitch and it would behoove you to show an admissions committee as little of your personality as possible. Instead, I say, \\"Because if you're not using a company like this, I'm sure that you know your competition will be.\\" I walk away without waiting to see her reaction, but I hope it gives her pause. Actually, I hope it cuts like a machete to the bone and makes her beg for my help. But the pause will be enough for now.  <br /> <br />The savvy, independent woman chicklit readers want to identify with is Rachel. She struggles in her relationships with her family, both envying her married sister and feeling blessed by and proud of her sister's family. She imagines a romantic life with her best friend Ben and then dismisses it before ruining both of their lives unlike Julia Roberts character in My Best Friend's Wedding. She handles her father's death, figures out how to run a business, makes quick smart decisions that further her company. She demands to be taken seriously and respected, particularly by her best friend and his fiance in one memorable restaurant showdown. Ah, the glory of it! Watching her business savvy is in itself a reason to read the book though ultimately, it is her entire coming of age, with her family, friends, romantic partners, and career, that make this story fascinating.  <br /> <br />Interestingly, inside the cover page, the Library of Congress offers its variety of cross referencing categories for the book: \\"unemployed women workers-fiction,\\" \\"self-employed women-fiction,\\" \\"women editors-fiction,\\" and \\"businesswomen-fiction.\\" Like the Library of Congress, I see this particular book of chicklit as more than a beach read. It is testimony to what chicklit could be if authors chose to empower their characters and let their lives be about more than finding Prince Charming.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-01

The ailments come early (rotted teeth from a misguided diet of apple juice in lieu of mother's milk) and often (degenerative cysts growing in her jaw at nine-years-old; cancer by 12). These are only highlights of a terrible litany.  <br /> <br />I was used to being alone within illness. The world recedes and other people are just phantoms, whether they are in the room or halfway across the world. <br /> <br />Deserving more than anyone of having herself a never-ending pity party, Lavender doesn't. Her matter-of-fact prose is as detached and spare as the persona her years of illness have sculpted, which makes the book, at times, seemingly lacking in emotional depth. However, this mirrors the tunnel vision that allowed her to cope. Amazingly, nowhere does Lavender speak - at any length at least - about becoming depressed. At an age when most kids were hanging upside down on monkey bars, her life was hanging by a thread, reduced to the simple antipodes of survival, life or death.  <br /> <br />Through it all, Lavender manages to finish college, have a kid, get a job and a steady male companion (marriage must not be her bag). And, refreshingly, she doesn't treat these accomplishments as any huge, big deal. Her nonchalance resides in her longtime wish to just `be a normal girl, with regular skin and ordinary clothes, commonplace hobbies and predictable friends.' Even if she isn't.  <br /> <br />My primary identity is found in my body, in the scars, in the injuries and injustice and disease and decay. My genetic code conveys the simple truth that I'm a freak: no other information about me is relevant. <br /> <br /> <br />... <br />The fact that I am alive is a daily revelation, but it is necessary to do more than just survive.  <br /> <br />Despite the physical Grand Guignol that life has lavished upon her, Bee Lavender's story is a testament to guts, endurance and an indomitable will to not succumb to the maladies that are laying siege to her body. You think nobody knows the trouble you've seen? Read this, and stop whining.  <br /> <br />	2005-05-12

What else could possibly happen that could keep us reading? Even Marie seems incapable of imagining any change or improvement in her life. She seems to turn to her boyfriend, Dell for help, telling him:  <br /> <br />\\"I love you too,\\" I say softly, tracing his cheek with one finger. \\"But if you tell anyone about my mother, I promise I'll never speak to you again.\\"  <br /> <br />I know he believes me because he shuts up quickly, not angry but despairing: I'm excellent at reading emotions - Momma's given me years of practice. <br /> <br />Marie has spent the years since Alyssa's death, tiptoeing on the edge, nervously anticipating any change in her mother's mood, yet loyally standing by, defying anyone who says she deserves to be treated better. Marie understands the restlessness of her mother, the woman who before clocking in at the meat-packing plant every day, sits gazing out at a field of rippling veldt, only able to escape in her mind, and only for a few hours a day. Marie fears she may be cursed with the same wanderlust, impossible to fulfill.  <br /> <br />Terri Brown-Davidson's writing is as taut as the fine tightrope Marie is walking. In a situation where the protagonist seems to have no hope for change, Brown-Davidson manages to maintain a gripping narrative, densely weaving Marie's past and present. Brown-Davidson has previous published a book of poetry, and while this influence is evident in her lyrical, visual style, she has deftly matched the richness of her writing with an cold, economic presentation of events, telling us exactly what we need to know about Marie. <br /> <br />This novel is about the dead-end cycle of abuse, and how difficult it is to escape the damage done. And although it is not a happy story, it is strangely optimistic, because only when Marie is faced with the worst situation yet, does she find the strength in herself to believe that she does not have accept the same destiny as her mother.  <br /> <br />	2005-05-10

Reviewed by Colleen Hollister for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Steve Almond is a storyteller, and a good one, possessing a distinctively engaging voice and obviously in love with the language he uses. His bestselling Candyfreak has an incredibly rich texture, wrapping the reader in his passions for both words and candy. Almond's newest short story collection The Evil B.B. Chow and Other Stories does the same (though unfortunately, no chocolate is involved). The stories collected here reestablish his talent for engaging readers and pulling them inescapably in; readers may not know exactly what is happening, but they will be glad nonetheless to have been through such an experience.  <br /> <br />The stories are throughout just that - an experience. They are weird but absorbing, at times slightly twisted, and in some cases perhaps not for the faint of heart. But the remarkably original ways in which they capture the fragility and absurdity of life manage to be real, heartfelt, and wholly believable at the same time.  <br /> <br />Almond is not afraid to test the boundaries of the unusual - one story has an entire family convinced they have been abducted by aliens, another Lincoln and Frederick Douglass traveling downriver on a flatboat while discussing slavery and life - but his situations, however dramatically different, are never implausible. Once absorbed, the reader does not question - it most likely would never even occur to her to question, so easy it is to get caught up in the action, eagerly anticipating the new twists spinning from Almond's imagination.  <br /> <br />Though twists from the normal are abundant, Almond never forgets the human element: the stories are not about the situations but the interrelationships of the people involved. The title story captures the happenings of a bizarre blind date, complete with the ridiculousness that accompanies falling in love; \\"I Am as I Am\\" first shocks with the bracing portrayal of an accident at a children'sballgame, and then spins out the nuances of its emotional consequences; in \\"Wired for Life,\\" a woman develops a strange obsession with the man who fixes her computer; \\"The Problem of Human Consumption\\" beautifully relates the delicate relationship of a widowed father with his growing daughter.  <br /> <br />Almond achieves the difficult balance between the strange and the entirely normal. The stories are easy to understand and easy to relate to without being at all simplistic, seeming effortless in a way that is definitely hard to create. The language possesses a strength and clarity that makes me certain it could not have been written any better; a blurb on the front cover warns not to quote from the uncorrected proof, otherwise it would be difficult to avoid quoting a fair bit of it. The stories are crystal clear, with well-chosen details, well-chosen words and characters that resound in the reader long after the story has ended. They are emotional without being heavy-handed, descriptive without being crowded, funny while still maintaining their heart. They are also, obviously, difficult to describe while still doing them justice. They would better be absorbed rather than picked apart.  <br /> <br />A group of writers together, discussing each others' work, will all invariably end up saying \\"I wish I wrote this,\\" \\"I wish I wrote that,\\" \\"I hate you because your story is true...and because I didn't write it.\\" The stories collected in The Evil B.B. Chow and Other Stories consistently ring with truisms that would throw strife and envy into writers prone to such things. Writers will certainly start hating Steve Almond soon; this is the mark of a good writer.  <br />	2005-04-22

From the introduction of The Cocaine Chronicles, editors Gary Phillips and Jervery Tervalon claim that they are \\"observers of the human condition in its various physical and psychological permutations\\". They were intrigued by this project as no one has ever broached an anthology on a drug that has been prevalent in our society for well over a century with its hey days in the 1920's and 1980's - decades that celebrated excess. In this bold anthology, we meet the casual sniffers, the heavy users, the dealers, the victims and the unsuspecting victims on both sides of the coast - hysterical romps, tragic characters and unfathomable lows - rendering cocaine a drug that is anything but glamorous. The Cocaine Chronicles is assembled in four sections that loosely dictate the varying degrees of addiction and the affects that cocaine has on its participants.  <br /> <br />An encounter between two men in a dive bar incurs chilling consequences in Lee Child's sharp opener, \\"The Keys\\" , as the reader bears witness to a low-rate drug mule's frantic confession that he robbed from a powerful Colombian crew - a million to be exact, in cash and keys - to what he believes to be a stranger. In Laura Lippman's \\"The Crack Cocaine Diet\\", two seemingly vapid mall rats resolve that the only way to be superior to the boyfriends who have dumped them is to drop weight fast and since the doctors are too \\"tight with the scripts\\" and fad diets just won't do, they decide on a cocaine binge to loose their excess baggage. After a series of phone calls, they make off for their adventure and a comedy of errors ensues from confusing drug slang (\\"American Idol\\" & \\"Survivor\\" as code names for coke and heroin) to screaming at dealers for refunds, the story takes a darker turn when the girls end up at a dealer's home. Lippman soars by deploying subtle cues of the underlying resentment between the two \\"best friends\\" and by the story's elegantly-drawn close, the reader learns to never underestimate vengeful,suburban girls. <br /> <br />In the section \\"Fiending\\", we shift from cocaine dabbling to full-blown addictions, where weekend party favors morph into daily rituals that turn into the shakes, the twitches, and suddenly you're hungry for your next fix. A junkie narrator crashes with his sixty-three-year-old \\"weirdly hot\\" drug dealer, Suzy, as she repeatedly regales Hollywood stories about her dead B-celebrity husband, while begging for coke to be shot up her ass in Jerry Stahl's pitch-perfect, \\"Twilight of the Stooges\\" . Stahl captures the tragic and hysterical life of an addict with pristine lucidity: <br /> <br />I don't have memories. I just have nerves that still hurt in my brain. Shooting coke does that. Even when you're smoking it, when you fixed you could just wipe the inside of your skull clean as porcelain. Coke was about toilets and toilets were shiny white.  <br /> <br />Through dialogue repetition, false light and a glaring television screen that dully illuminates, Stahl navigates the addict's world with such vigor. Where cocaine is the only light even when you realize you can't remotely feel anything - all your emotions have numbed, where self-humiliation is par for the course and you've become this person who thinks coke is salvation but you're left with white-outs and a life not lived, suffering in a confined, inescapable state of despair that worsens with the passing of each day. In Robert Ward's deliciously twisted \\"Chemistry\\", a self-professed \\"connoisseur\\" of women - seducing unsuspecting women with feigned sensitivity and cocaine at his local bar - discovers the cost of his sly, manipulative mind-games.  <br /> <br />In the section \\"Corruption\\", the lens turns its focus outward, to ruminate on the victims of cocaine who are not solely the users. Neglected children that assume adult roles while toiling in their own filth, still yearn to be innocent, playful children yet suffer the consequences of the adult users in their life (a dope-fiend mother,a paternal \\"pleasant\\" drug dealer and a down & out landlord frightened to lose his drug connection) in Kerry West's deft tale, \\"Shame\\".  <br /> <br />In the final section, \\"Gangsters and Monsters\\", characters are at their southernmost point. A kingpin drug lord who has now found god and the good life but struggles to snitch on a murder that could inevitably cost him his life, a man leading a ho-hum life is finally awakened when his car is stolen and used in a fatal police car chase/drug bust and a ex-con chef trying to lead a sober, mindful life, gets pulled into the world of celebrity when he works for an eccentric music mogul - all the stories offer the hope for redemption, a way out.  <br /> <br />With the exception of a few overwritten, unrealized accounts - the all too-familiar theme that cocaine will ruin your life, with little deviation from this ideology of JUST SAY NO! - the stories in The Cocaine Chronicles are sometimes poignant, sometimes horrifying, but quite frequently, rather satisfying.  <br /> <br />	2005-03-21

Reviewed by Katherine Darnell for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Our Ecstatic Days by Steve Erickson is a fiercely thematic and though-provoking look at a futurist Los Angeles entering the so-called Age of Chaos. Erickson has undertaken an extended meditation on loss, motherhood, identity, chaos, power, love, and the amorphous nature of relationships. While at times maddeningly non-linear, the continuous toying with the shape and content of the novel serves to bolster Erickson's ideas about the state of the world and the potential for our fears to be realized. He passionately explores the ways that humans are trapped in a sustained and endless cycle of birth and rebirth, with the characters of Our Ecstatic Days repeatedly forced to relive the agonies of the world in a karmic exercise of persistence and endurance. The unconventional organization of the novel includes an italicized stream of text darting through most of the book as well as passages printed in shapes that ebb and flow on the page. Erickson is not afraid to dispense with traditional concepts of chronology and order, with the novel jumping freely through time, space, and events in a way that is unleashed and un-reigned.  <br /> <br />Central to the novel is Lake Zed, a lake that has inexplicably formed in the center of Los Angeles, submerging entire neighborhoods with its mysteriously sourced water. Kristin Blumenthal takes her three-year-old son Kirk (named for the father of existentialist thought, Soren Kierkegaard), on a ride to the center of the lake in a silver gondola. Kristin, in a wave of either madness or clarity, crawls over the edge of the gondola and begins her plunge to the source of the lake. When she remerges, her son is gone from the boat, and owls ominously circle the sky. This catalyzing event gives birth to a chimera of time-bending, shape-shifting events, unleashing a rumination that forces the reader to contemplate an ominous, vaguely sci-fi, alternative future in which the newlychildless Kristin becomes Lulu Blu, a dominatrix working out of the Chateau X hotel, who becomes Saint Kristin revered by a cult of followers, who becomes the Madwoman in Red constantly perambulating the lake. The monkey doll that Kirk carried with him in the gondola on that inauspicious day takes on theological weight and status as a relic, and Kirk reappears throughout the novel, morphing into a variety of incarnations, ultimately realized as a mysterious, solitary figure navigating a gondola on the lake, a kind of savior to Bronte Blu, who might be another child of Kristin's. There is also a parallel character named Kristin, a woman who is mourning a deep, unbearable loss in another apartment in Los Angeles. Erickson dares to incorporate the historically based character of Wang, who stood defiantly before army tanks during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Wang finds himself thrust into the post-Tiananmen Square future in Los Angeles, where public perception forces him to forever face the iconic image of himself standing in protest before the tanks bearing down on him. Wang is elevated to a hero in the dispersed wars and battles being waged in Los Angeles, a series dubbed the Tribulations. He writes letters of adoration and devotion to the parallel Kristin, but sadly the letters go unanswered because they never reach the right woman, instead being delivered to Kristin Blumenthal.  <br /> <br />Erickson focuses on the role and meaning of motherhood and womanhood, liberally employing metaphors for the fluid, embryonic, and menstrual aspects of the world in Our Ecstatic Days. The lake growing in the center of L.A. is a great effeminate entity, mystifying, powerful, unpredictable. Kirsten is fearless before the birth of her son Kirk, but once she becomes a mother her fears of chaos and potential danger becomes all-consuming. Even the italicized sentence that darts through the novel feels umbilical, detailing Kirsten's descent to the bottom of Lake Zed and then back up, where the reader is repeatedly told that she is journeying, \\"through the birth canal of the lake.\\"  <br /> <br />The question \\"What If\\" hangs over Our Ecstatic Days, haunting every aspect of this world. What if Kirk hadn't disappeared? What if Kristin hadn't decided to dive down to the source of Lake Zed? Because of these events, the world spins out into a surreal place of turmoil and heartbreak. Erickson argues with the idea and power of God, including a bondage hallucination by Lulu/Kristin, who imagines herself as a dominatrix to God. She berates and humiliates him, tying him up, violating him, whipping him, cursing him for his cruelty. She rails against God for inflicting such pain, for treating humans like toys, for creating such chaos. It is her revenge fantasy and a way of getting back at Him for the pain and humiliation he inflicts on the world.  <br /> <br />Despite the strange and painful journeys endured throughout Our Ecstatic Days, the novel ends with a melody of hope. The world rights itself in small but significant ways and the past is proved to be suppler than previously imagined. Kristin moves back up through the water, towards the silver gondola where she'd left Kirk, back into the realm of order. Whether this movement is intended as metaphor or reality (or most likely both), Erickson takes the reader away from the dark recesses of history and war and loss and mourning, back into the light, above the lake of unexplained origins, where hope might still live, where life might remain untouched by the taint of the future. <br />	2005-03-09
US	49474042	R67J4O0U49F5T	0972255362	189182293	I Am Spam	Books	4	2	2	N	N	a collection of funny, insightful poems	Reviewed by Summer Lopez for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />In I Am Spam Larry O. Dean uses the subject lines of spam emails he has received to create the titles of his poems, and then writes poems to fit the sometimes random, sometimes unintentionally meaningful titles. This postmodern twist on the found poem results in a collection of funny, insightful poems that celebrate the blurry boundary between reality and fantasy-the absurdity of what people want to, and will, believe.  <br /> <br />Considering the inherent mass-ness of spam emails, it's not surprising that the titles of Dean's poems look familiar-\\"Be Your Own Boss,\\" \\"I Ate Chocolate and Lost 20 Lbs,\\" \\"Modern Miracles Take Years off Your Face\\"-we've all seen these lines before. Yet how many of us take a moment to think what these messages really mean, and what sort of human tendencies they are intended to tap into? Dean explores these questions, sometimes seriously, as when he is pondering the ease of online adultery, and sometimes purely humorously, as in the bizarre concoctions he describes that might potentially take years off one's face: \\"The blood of kittens / stolen from mobile homes / at the stroke of midnight, / boiled with frankincense / and Vitamin E supplements / applied as a mask / for one hour daily.\\"  <br /> <br />Dean's tongue, however, is always firmly in his cheek, and even the funniest of these poems has something to say about the excess and absurdity of our modern lives, where an email might be able to tell us if we're an artist or not, and where, with more wealth than any nation in the history of the world has ever known, we are constantly looking for ways to \\"Stop Paying Too Much.\\" In this, the final and perhaps most comical of the poems, Dean provides the obvious answer to this dilemma: \\"Stop paying too much, / or simply stop paying. / See it; grab it; run. / Ignore alarms. Act / innocent, remembering / no one is. Ask / for your lawyer... Name your own price, / something nice, suchas Fred.\\"  <br /> <br />At first these poems may appear offhand or casual, but in reality they have something very important to say about the soundbites that threaten to define our lives. The concern is not so much that we are spam but that spam-like all media and advertising-is really just a reflection of us, our priorities, our concerns, our fears. Dean's collection is therefore a clever capturing of something that in its own way tells a story of our society. One we usually delete without a second thought.  <br /> <br />	2005-03-01

Reviewed by Steven Hansen for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />You might think a novel about reality television would be funny, pompous, self important, and, ultimately, forgettable. And you're right. But if you're talking about Erik Barmack's debut book, you're also wrong. You see, The Virgin has a split personality, just like its protagonist Joseph/Jeb and everyone else portrayed within its lily white pages.  <br /> <br />I'm Joseph, I'm Jeb. I could be other people too. But most of all I'm the sum of my ambitions, my desires.  <br /> <br />These ambitions/desires consist of Joseph finagling his way onto the all-male cast of a show where the last man chosen by the slim-hipped, blond and beautiful virgin named Madison has the honor of deflowering her.  <br /> <br />Joseph plans to become the brooding anti-hero Jeb because he doesn't think an unemployed loser like himself stands a chance. This self-induced, psychological makeover only succeeds in making Joseph/Jeb into a bundle of nerves, more prone to tongue-tied silence and unintelligible outbursts of emotion than the cool calculation of the new man he wishes to become. Unbeknownst to Joseph, his alter ego Jeb only makes it onto the show because the producer needs to type cast a blubbering fool.  <br /> <br />...right now, let's just say my life is a little unbalanced. Let's just say that I'm not exactly resting on the Prudential Rock, and who I am is in a state of flux.  <br /> <br />Once the cast of the show is assembled, the story shifts into three distinct modes: Jeb's insider's view of the unreal goings on; the mad cap recaps of each episode from the point of view of an acerbic fan; and Madison's sad e-mails to her mysterious friend Mitchell.  <br /> <br />As long as Jeb is not referring to himself, he is a reliable narrator, and it is fun to compare the producer-manipulated and carefully crafted, edited events of the shoot to the so-called true-to-life program flickering months later on the television screen.  <br /> <br />Madison's e-mails to Mitchell are a whole other story; in them, she seems to be apologizing, asking forgiveness, of her former lover for what it is she is about to do. Once you know her secret, it is irresistible to go back and re-read these e-mails because of their added poignancy and sense of impending doom. Her references to the Salem Witch Trials are particularly canny, referring as they do to those accused of being something they are not. Not to mention their implications of 'deals with the devil.' <br /> <br />Like the form of television it lampoons, The Virgin is a skillful manipulation. A satisfying and disturbing one that not only indicts the producers and casts of such programs, but points a finger at the rubbernecking public whose malignant addiction to these emotional gorefests may be the thing fueling their manic rise. Unlike the vast majority of reality television series, however, The Virgin lingers in your brain long after the final chapter; its central question teasing you to contemplate which is more compelling and more real: Reality Itself or The Idea of Reality? In Pink Floyd's words, would you rather have a small part in the war or a lead role in a cage? Or, in the case of The Virgin's haunting last scene, would you rather be anonymous or recognizable to somebody already inside a fish bowl themselves?  <br />	2005-03-01

Reviewed by Cindy Dale for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Wagner's characters exasperate you with their LA-style self-absorption, self-delusion and paranoia. His high-speed prose makes you dizzy with its name-dropping, pyrotechnics and barbs. Part farce, part satire and part pathos, The Chrysanthemum Palace, Wagner's fifth novel, secures Wagner a top spot in the pantheon of Hollywood novelist all stars, right up there with F. Scott Fitzgerald and Nathaniel West. As he ably demonstrated in first Force Majeure and again in his triple-play `cellular trilogy,' I'm Losing You, I'll Let You Go and Still Holding, no one does Hollywood quite like Bruce Wagner.  <br /> <br />As The Chrysanthemum Palace opens, we meet the self-dubbed `Three Muskateers.' There is Clea Freemantle, the fragile daughter of a long dead, once ravishing movie star of a certain era (reminiscent of Judy Garland). Then there is Thad Michelet, the rakish, 54-year-old Off-Broadway actor/straight-to-remainder novelist/\\"guest star on just about every CSI permutation to date.\\" Thad is the sole surviving son of \\"Black Jack\\" Michelet, a womanizing literary lion without peers. And finally, we meet Bertie Krohn, our narrator and the only child of Perry Krohn, the incredibly rich and successful creator of \\"Starwatch: The Navigators\\", the longest running, wildly popular, beyond cult status TV space soap. These three scions of the rich/famous/borderline immortal, are about to co-star together in a special episode of \\"Starwatch\\".  <br /> <br />Yes, nepotism is alive and well, and the trio of friends has Bertie's father to thank for their forthcoming celluloid adventure. One can not help but wonder where any of the three would be without their famous parent. How does one escape the shadow of `genius?' Can one ever live up to an icon? These are questions that have dogged Clea, Thad and Bertie for a lifetime. Bertie notes in one of his many asides, \\"Sorry, folks, but it's true-at the root of everything is the needto please one's parents.\\"  <br /> <br />Open the book to any given page and you will find it studded with bon mots-the Hollywood / LA variety. No one on the literary or Hollywood radar screen, living or dead, is out of reach of Wagner's skewer. Here is Thad's mother, a photographer of sorts who is putting together a vanity coffee-type book of literary greats (which will most definitely not include her son), telling Thad who she's off to shoot next:  <br /> <br />Wallace Foster or Foster Wallace teaches nearby. Relatively. Someplace called Pomona. A lot of these colleges pay, Thad. Irvine too. Big, big budgets. They're going to drive me. Evidently they give him millions to teach. You know, he was a great fan of Jack's-they used to chat on the phone at indecent hours. Alice Sebold teaches there too. Her husband's quite well known, as well. A novelist. They're both bestsellers. I'm going to do both of them, then fly to San Francisco for Eggers and Michael Something. <br /> <br />\\"Chabon?\\" Thad replies. His mother answers, \\"Yes\\". He won the Pulitzer. And I believe he makes quite a living writing screenplays.\\" To which Thad mutters, \\"Jesus. Mr. Spider-Man 2!\\"  <br /> <br />Or consider the exchange that occurs between Thad and the lawyers after the death of Thad's father and the reading of the will. It should come as no surprise that `Black Jack' is still calling the shots even after death, having willed Thad $10 million dollars with one tiny provision: one of Thad's books must appear on the New York Times bestseller list. As the first lawyer explains to Thad, \\"I guess your father's intentions were that you use your gifts to write something either very commercial-a John Grisham, or what have you-a Da Vinci Code-or something artistic, with crossover appeal.\\" To which Thad retorts, \\"Bergdorf Blondes?\\" A second lawyer chimes in, \\"Not Bergdorf Blondes. Like The Corrections. Remember the guy who pissed Oprah off? Didn't that make the list? Some years back? I'm pretty sure itdid. My theory-it's only a theory!-is that Jack was thinking of this as an incentive, a goal to work toward. A reward, if you will.\\" But inspiration soon strikes and Thad and his cohorts may very well have the last laugh.  <br /> <br />We trail the narcissistic trio through two weeks of filming as they hatch their plan to fulfill the codicil. From the \\"Starwatch\\" set to The Shutters Hotel to Disneyland, the three fast friends ricochet through the story-all the way to the Bun Boy Hotel and the novel's tragic desert denouement. <br /> <br />The self-absorbed wannabes, the white wine swilling, the pill-popping, the AA meetings, the pitches, the agents, the lawyers-it's all there, and then some. Buckle up. You're in for quite a ride, and bring along a tissue. All but the most jaded will need it by the end.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-09

Reviewed by Sarah Morris for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Much like the backward beginning of his own life, Max Tivoli starts his confessions at the end of his story, letting the reader know right away what it took him sixty years to learn: \\"We are each the love of someone's life.\\" While this is the main theme of The Confessions of Max Tivoli, author Andrew Sean Greer introduces it through the intriguing concept of a man who ages in reverse. Born with the physical characteristics of a 70-year-old man, Max's body grows younger while his mind and heart age normally, growing wiser through coming-of-age experiences complicated by his extraordinary condition.  <br /> <br />For the three lovers tangled together in Max's memoir, love is comprised of moments of brief fulfillment and stretches of empty longing. Elusive, independent, artistic, and unattainable, Alice is the love of Max's life. Max meets Alice at age 17, when he appears to be a man of 53. Throughout his life, Max puts his quest for Alice before anything else. Masking himself comes naturally to Max, and he happily becomes whatever will bring him closer to Alice. Although he confesses that \\"it is a brave and stupid thing,\\" he does not deny that it is also \\"a beautiful thing, to waste one's life for love.\\"  <br /> <br />In this story of an uncommon man's life, it is the \\"common\\" details that shine. Greer renders everyday experiences with a slow, precise beauty that forces readers to pause and observe the tiny miracles in the relationship between man and the world around him. Greer's descriptions of the smallest details capture moments from Max's life in poignant vignettes-a purple iris on the ground is \\"a frozen kiss,\\" his devolving hands \\"[shrink] into tender starfish.\\" Through his journal, Max holds his memories up to the light, pausing in his precious last moments to note the shimmering beauty of so many commonplace experiences, remarkable to him for their lack of peculiarity. The abnormality of his condition defines him, separates him from even the most mundane events in life. \\"Boys,\\" he writes as he watches his young son play baseball, \\"you don't mean to be wonders, but you are.\\" To Max, the most average aspect of living is a miracle.  <br /> <br />Simultaneously mournful and worshipful, Max's ache for all he has missed underscores each page in his collected confessions. While occasionally tempered with wry humor, the longing is ever-present. The danger that this melancholy might lead to monotony is overcome by the beauty of the language itself. Max's voice throughout-so soft, so weathered, so patiently tired-pulls the reader into the pages of a journal textured throughout with the scents and sounds of faded memories. His thoughts are a parting gift to the people he loves, a farewell letter that is a privilege to read.  <br /> <br />	2005-01-20

Due to a complicated head injury suffered from the Vietnam War, Howard Kapostash is unable to speak or write, and lives in a world of solitude for almost thirty years. He carts around cards that explain his situation and he assures people that he is of normal intelligence. He remains in the house he grew up, takes on the occasional prostitute and had his own bought with alcohol and drug addiction. As many disabled people are forced to do, he takes on menial work at a local convent, mowing lawns and performing assorted repair work. His house is filled with boarders and people weave in and out of Howard's seemingly uncomplicated life rather easily. That is until his effusive high school sweetheart, Sylvia, shows up at his doorstep, nine-year-old son in tow and explains her situation: an intervention has been staged by her older sister, Carolyn. Sylvia's going into rehab for her cocaine addiction and could Howard take care of her son, Ryan, just for a short time? What ensues through the course of the novel is the transformative affect Ryan has on Howard. For the first time in years, Howard is frustrated with his world of silence that has him boxed in and he yearns for something beyond his empty life - fun, love and a sense of family.  <br /> <br />King navigates this world of silence, yearning and loss with precision without being precious or sentimental. His characters are flawed, honest people that seek the basest of things: love, compassion and the closest thing one can conceive as a normal life of baseball, hot dogs and lazy bbq's. I was enveloped by the beautiful, elliptical prose and the story's conceit: how does a man function in a world of silence where the only words are spoken in interior monologue? I wondered how King would pull this off, but he did, and brilliantly.  <br />	2004-12-23

Reviewed by Steven Hansen, Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Two things in the novel Genesis that are transparently biblical in reference (if not in proportion) are a flood about halfway through, and the protagonist, Felix Dern's physiological mandate to 'Be fruitful and multiply,' with every female he has ever known. 'Known,' that is [insert wink and nudge here]... biblically speaking.  <br /> <br />Humanity isn't drowned out, though, in this good book, and Felix Dern is not the progenitor of a nation. Though, owing to his almost perfect intercourse-to-conception percentage, he could be if he had sex more often. But he hasn't and, therefore, isn't. Good thing, too, because like most actors, psychologically speaking, he's a mess.  <br /> <br />An actor ... [is] most confident when they are not <br />themselves ..., and no matter what they do, no matter  <br />their curses, there'd be no price to pay when the  <br />curtain falls, no child to bear and rear and feed  <br />forevermore, amen.  <br /> <br />Procreation -- personified by Felix, or Lix for short (a punny contraction because of all the female boots he licks) -- seems to be author Jim Crace's point. Felix, in particular, is a forgettable character; whereas Lix, the hyper-potent sperm donor, is the singularly ubiquitous Man.  <br /> <br />For one so fertile and flamboyant, for one so  <br />arrogant in costume, Felix Dern, the showman,  <br />was--offstage--surprisingly shy and timid. That  <br />was, in rising middle age, his major flaw, his  <br />main regret--and also his saving grace.  <br /> <br />Ironically (is the irony intentional?), the same flawed saving grace could be said to be working for the novel's plot, which consists of dinner and a movie, followed by an almost book-length Felix this-is-your-life flashback showing how, when and where and with whom each of his happy accidents (or curses?) have been conceived.  <br /> <br />There is nothing in Genesis on an epic scale, no angel-heralded deusex machina to turn certain doom into instant triumph. There is nothing turbo-charged or ostentatious, and in the hands of a lesser writer, the book could have easily turned out as entertaining as all the begats in Leviticus. Even when the narrative drags in spots, it is picked up and redeemed by Crace's consistently beautiful writing and the epigrammatic lines that periodically fall onto the page like manna from the sky:  <br /> <br />Everything's exotic and amusing when the object  <br />of your journey is a body and a bed.  <br /> <br />We need to flirt and covet strangers for the  <br />health and spirit of our marriages.  <br /> <br />Juveniles had all the fun. The trick for adults,  <br />then, was to act like juveniles.  <br /> <br />These little darts of wisdom scattered throughout the narrative are like candy sparkles on a cake: they don't do much to the overall flavor, but the added color is nice. This is not to say that Genesis is a superficial confection, just one with enough visual pizzazz to appeal to those who like to stare in the bakery window at all the pretty dainties on display. And, if Crace ever stumbles across this review, he may be cringing once he gets to this point, wondering when and if this cake metaphor is ever going to end! Or maybe, owing to the sharp wit he seems to possess, based upon the subtlety of his writing, he's nodding his head knowingly, anticipating the inevitable denouement. Regardless of this whimsical and far too self indulgent speculation, here it is (the denouement that is): cake and birthdays go together like firecrackers on the Fourth of July. Or childbirth and existence, which seems to be at the core of what Crace's novel -- at its moist and chewy center -- is mostly all about.  <br /> <br />Still, the streaks and pricks of light are  <br />eloquent. They tell of people going home. They <br />tell of love and lovemaking, of children,  <br />marriages, and lives. You think, But this could  <br />happen anywhere. It does.  <br /> <br />And the why and when of how people come together, fall in love and fall apart is really just so much Shakespearean sound and fury [No one's to blame, but passion is not intended to endure./Falling in love is not being in love. Waiting for the perfect partner is self-sabotage.]. What matters most between a man and a woman is the simple act of reproduction. Because, eventually, you will come to understand that sex is not love and it isn't love -- or that type of love -- in the end that really matters anyway.  <br /> <br />	2004-12-21

You don't need to know this before you read his lovely collection of ghazals, but it does make these graceful verses all the more powerful to know they were written in the shadow of eternity: \\"Even Death won't hide the poor Fugitive forever; / on Doomsday he will learn he must live forever.\\"  <br /> <br />The ghazal is an ancient Persian form of poetry, and Ali uses this traditional structure to his advantage in contemplating modern life. Within the strict schema of the verse, Ali finds space to stretch his impressive linguistic muscles. In language that is both playful and elegant, timely and timeless, Ali constructs beautiful poems which are clearly the voice of a man looking back on his life with wisdom and humor.  <br /> <br />The construction of the ghazal involves the use of a repeated rhyme followed by a refrain, usually one word or a short phrase, which Ali also uses as the title of each poem. This format creates a sense of suspense not often found in poetry, leaving you wondering how each couplet will end and whether it will make you laugh, cry, or merely wonder at his creativity. Can you possibly not love a poet who rhymes \\"Guggenheim\\" with \\"paradigm\\" and \\"Le Chaim?\\" The poems' refrains-\\"Arabic,\\" \\"water,\\" \\"bones,\\" \\"by exiles,\\" \\"of light\\" and \\"God,\\" to name a few-guide us through lines packed with allusions to the Koran, Borges, and Rushdie. And at the end of many poems, Ali works in his own name, like the shadow of a ghost, leaving us to wonder who he truly wishes to address when he asks, \\"You've forgiven everyone, Shahid, even God- / Then how could someone like you not live forever?\\" Perhaps he could not, but thankfully, his verses continue to burn with life.  <br /> <br />	2004-11-29

Reviewed by Steven Hansen for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Clinging to the bottom of a locomotive, this daring young Transylvanian escapes the deprivations of Nicolai Ceacescu's Romania and lands in the politically- and economically-transforming world of early 1990s Hungary.  <br /> <br />Displaying the willfulness that will come to define him, this brash young man phones a local Budapest hockey club and demands that he be given a try out in goal. Once on the ice, it is clear to the coaches and the players that, when it comes to hockey, this so-called goalie is an impostor. Unable or unwilling to admit this fact to himself -- and undaunted by the slap shots aimed at his head by his future teammates - our hero guts it out. Two hours and one broken nose later, the team's captain is, despite himself, impressed.  <br /> <br />\\"It's simply amazing,\\" Pek said, \\"that there is a person on this planet who wants to be goalie for our team so badly even though he clearly has never had anything to do with hockey before in his life.\\"  <br /> <br />So begins the saga of Attila Ambrus, the unpaid back-up goalie for one of Hungary's most prestigious hockey clubs, and, not incidentally, the bank robbing folk hero who would inspire the people of a country in the middle of a chaotic transition from communist satellite-state to capitalist free-fire-zone.  <br /> <br />\\"I'm a criminal,\\" Attila said. \\"But the goal was not to get money at all costs. There were many cases where I could have shot somebody, but the most important thing was that there would be no violence, no blood.\\"  <br /> <br />His candid admission of who he was and his nonviolent style of fleecing the system was two of the reasons he was so beloved. The public recognized the stark contrast between the honest criminal and the government officials who looted the public coffers as a matter of course, then played dumb when the cameras were rolling.  <br /> <br />In the year 2000, Award-winning journalist Julian Rubinstein considered Attila Ambrus only an interview for a story he was doing for Details magazine. Three years and a couple hundred interviews later, he was finishing up the story that had morphed into the book he'd been compelled to write; a book that reads like some fantastic crime novel chronicling the very real actions of an extraordinary man trying to survive and make a lasting name for himself in transitionary times.  <br /> <br />Instead of a dry recitation of facts, you get drama, movement and Henny Youngman-esque one liners. For example, Rubinstein describes a just-arrived-in-Hungary Attila's archaic dialect as follows:  <br /> <br />It was like talking to a Hungarian Shakespeare.  <br /> <br />And this smart turn of phrase hilariously illuminates Atilla's continued poverty despite the former Iron Curtain's first pangs of ideological renaissance.  <br /> <br />While Czechoslovakia's playwright president Vaclav Havel was championing \\"living in truth,\\" Attila was still living in his teammates' underwear.  <br /> <br />Rubinstein earned a Master's degree from the Columbia School of Journalism and gradually made a name for himself writing investigative pieces and profiles about such sports luminaries as John McEnroe, Sugar Shane Mosely and Orlando 'El Duque' Hernandez.  <br /> <br />Rubinstein uses something called 'literary journalism' (a methodology made famous by Truman Capote's In Cold Blood) to create these profiles and, incidentally, he used it to create this book. In a nutshell, this consists of cross-referencing the interviews you've conducted, the court documents and police reports you've pored over, and using some logic, common sense and imagination to fill out the rest of the scene. It's creative nonfiction, with a pinch of intuition thrown in to taste. Which, in this book's case, is a recipe for success.  <br /> <br />Though the phrase 'literary journalism' may sound like an oxymoron, somewhere between the 'literature' and the 'journalism' lays the truth.And it's no lie to say that, by telling the story of Attila Ambrus, Julian Rubinstein has tapped into something universal:  <br /> <br />Yet like his country and his people, all Attila ever really wanted was to be respected and to belong somewhere he could call home. And though that may not have transpired the way he envisioned, it has indeed come to pass.  <br /> <br />Ballad of the Whiskey Robber is a rollicking crime story, a commentary on the effects of the fall of Communism on the former Eastern Bloc, and a beautiful portrait of historic Budapest, mixed together with the exploits of a kinder, gentler and drunker incarnation of Attila the Hun. <br />	2004-11-11

Richard Powers in his introduction to The Paris Review Book for Planes, Trains, Elevators, and Waiting Rooms, tells us readers that \\"We are living in the middle of an epidemic... infecting us with the contagion of real time\\", and \\"we read to escape - if only briefly - the trap of real time, and then to return and recognize - if only briefly - the times we are trapped in.\\" Organized by the time that the reader has available at that moment - albeit vast stretches of time to merely seconds - this remarkable anthology delivers the breadth and depth of astute writing that has affirmed The Paris Review as the preeminent literary journal of our time.  <br /> <br />In the section, \\"Planes\\" - life's brief moments to a dynasty of history marks the various stories assembled. Edward P. Jones's, \\"Marie\\", an elderly SSI recipient is summoned to wait in offices through notices signed by a dead bureaucrat, attacks a receptionist, wards off a mugger with a knife, and confesses her dismal life for a Howard University student onto tapes which are too painful to hear. In Karl Iagnemma's, \\"On the Nature of Human Romantic Interaction\\", Joseph, an ex-PhD. student who mans phones in the TechInfo office, tries to mathematically comprehend the complexity of his love for his ex-PhD. advisor's daughter, Alexandra who \\"is stingy with love; she is afraid of ending up like her parent's, who squandered their love like drunks at a craps table\\". After posing a timed marriage ultimatum - accept the proposal prior to graduation, in the end Joseph loses the fickle Alexandra for he can't conjure the equations to make sense of the range of human emotion.  <br /> <br />In the section, \\"Trains\\", great moments are compacted. In Raymond Carver's, \\"Why Don't You Dance\\", a lonely man offers up his belongings in a yard sale to a giddy couple only if they give him the pleasure of conversation and a quick dance. A Brahman wife, desperate for any prayer or religion which will save her dying husband, secretly turnsto Christianity for a cure in V.S. Naipul's, \\"My Aunt Gold Teeth\\".  <br /> <br />Poems predominately mark the section, \\"Elevators\\". Deborah Warren considers mortality and the invented machine \\"...so frail its breath/depends on something casual as the air/you cruise on, asymptotic to your death?\\" in her poem, \\"Airplane\\". The exquisite and seductive mistress heroin and the fantastic world and textures it simulates are addressed in Jim Carroll's, \\"Heroin\\". White rooms, white flowers, and chalky light evoke a supremely disturbing marriage to the lethal drug. Could escape and magic exist underneath the astringent hospital corridors - \\"through the deserted tunnels linking buildings\\" - in Lucy Grealy's wonderful verse, \\"Ward 10\\"? A world beyond medical terminology, animal experiments and recovery wards.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most prolific section of the anthology is \\"Waiting Rooms\\" with stories from Rick Moody, Charles D'Ambrosio and Ethan Canin. A year after her death, a brother grieves his sister who was killed in a tragic drunk-driving accident en route to her wedding rehearsal dinner in Rick Moody's, \\"The Mansion on the Hill\\". Andrew takes a job at a wedding planning agency, ignores the heart-felt advances of a pretend marriage-obsessive c-worker. Andrew excels at the problem-solving, the business of marriage until he spies the man who was to marry his sister, marrying another woman -- I no longer knew what marriage meant, really, except that the celebration of it seemed built into every life I knew but my own -- it is only then Andrew confronts and moves past his loss. In the absolute star of the collection is the closing story, Ethan Canin's, \\"The Palace Thief\\" where a classics professor meets his moral match in a manipulative senator's son - their complex and compromising relationship and war of ethics haunts the narrator for over four decades until he once again unites with the boy, now a wealthy baron who seeks to challenge the teacher once again.  <br /> <br/>The Paris Review is that experienced Madame, rouged up, filthy-mouthed - she's seen and done it all. From interviews with Nabokov to Richard Howard, the prose of Alice Munro, William Maxwell and T.C. Boyle - the artisans of the traditional short story form, to the innovative styles conjured by Lydia Davis and Raymond Carver, to the gritty poems of Jim Carroll and the prolific verses of Pinsky, Olds and Larkin, The Paris Review has published the greatest works of the twentieth century and no doubt after the untimely passing of its colorful patron, George Plimpton, the bar for great writing will continue to be raised high.  <br /> <br />	2004-11-11

Weisgerber for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Imagine that Hans Christian Anderson has finally reached his limit with the various `Disney-fied' adaptations of his story, \\"The Little Mermaid\\", and mentions his frustration to Winslow Homer, Charles Dickens and H.P. Lovecraft over drinks up in Heaven. All agree and contribute ideas for a re-write. And perhaps they've funneled their vision through Samantha Hunt, and, thus, her first novel, The Seas, might have been born.  <br /> <br />Samantha Hunt writes as if her pen were a sable paintbrush. Though we never know the name of our heroine/protagonist, we see her plainly and vividly, a waif of a soul living in a northern seacoast town where `The highway only goes south from here'. With rocky coastal beaches, frozen water and not much else, a bleak future lies ahead for anyone unfortunate to live there. And while this young woman is aware of her salt-of-the-earth lineage, she has come to believe she's unlike anyone else in the town. She believes she is a mermaid.  <br /> <br />The catalyst for this belief is her father's disappearance eleven years before when he walked into the ocean and never came back. While the rest of the town accepts this as suicide, the young woman's mother still waits for her missing husband to return. This, in turn, only strengthens the young woman's conviction. In her mind, she reasons that if her father is alive, then he must be a creature of the sea and, therefore, she must be a mermaid as he had commented many years before.  <br /> <br />As with Anderson's mermaid, there is a prince, Jude, only he has been served a fate not unlike a character from a Dicken's tale. A veteran of the Gulf War, he is an alcoholic womanizer who carries a secret that is tearing him apart. Our young woman yearns for him and offers herself openly, only to be shunned. And, we all know the fate that awaits a mermaid who cannot win the love of her prince.  <br /> <br />Hunt portrays the conflicts and confusion of the young heroine convincingly through the use of first person. There is an ethereal quality to her vibrant prose, which fluctuates between the earthly and mythical worlds of the main character's mind. Despite the mystical elements, the angst and the reality of the hard circumstances are always as sharp as the jagged rocks of a cliffwalk. The Seas is a mesmerizing story, one that draws you in like a soft September undertow and it's not until you feel the chill of the deep ocean that you realize how far from shore you are.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-28

Mangarella for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />If the world can be divided into two distinct groups, maybe half would play it safe while the other half pursues their passion through every imaginable risk. Some people make the news while others prefer to watch it on television. Jennifer Beth Cohen followed her desire beyond peril's gates into a Russia where the society was not only coming apart but morphing back together again in ways no one could dream, let alone predict. She fell in love, abandoned her life in Manhattan and moved to Moscow and chronicled her journal in her debut, Lying Together, My Russian Affair. <br /> <br />Cohen chased a hazardous tale about the Russian mob's stranglehold on global prostitution while romancing with Kevin, an unforgotten college heart throb. She went looking for love in all the wrong places and found Doctor Zhivago on acid. Her love affair, both with Kevin as well as her work in a dangerously fragmented land, is written from the heart. She turns her journalistic eye inward and reports upon herself with scalding honesty. She's in love with Kevin who is handsome, sexy and has a Rolodex of Russian contacts at her disposal. Cohen sees her world expanding both romantically and professionally. Great love. Great articles. Countless kisses and maybe a few awards. Russia is a volcano of stories, each one lethal, every one a jagged puzzle piece left behind by the old Soviet Union. But the newsrooms back in the U.S.A. don't want cutting edge journalism highlighting the new Russia. They prefer easily digested Russian stereotypes rather than complicated Russian gangsters and how they rule the land.  <br /> <br />Make no doubt about it, this is truly Jennifer Cohen's story despite how deeply she loves Kevin. Right down to the engagement ring on her finger that was pried off the bloody hand of a Russian mobster's girlfriend following their assassination. Kevin thought the ring, with its history, its color, was a flavor of Russia today. From the moment she placed the ring on her finger, her story crashes through the looking glass. Kevin's \\"work\\" suddenly takes priority and the few times they land on a story together, you can feel the professional tension. After all, Kevin is the one with the contacts in Moscow and St.Petersburg while Cohen slowly becomes an outsider in her own home. A meeting with friends suddenly becomes an intervention designed to get Kevin into a substance abuse rehab thus leaving the author alone in a country gone berserk.  <br /> <br />Jennifer Beth Cohen opens herself with every sentence and buried within the descriptions of each incident lay the Russian face with which she came eye to eye. Lying Together, My Russian Affair is an intimate book because she shows us Russia by baring both the love and the scars left her by a dangerous land.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-28

But this doesn't mean it's not a suspenseful story. The Night Country has its fair share of spirits, bloodshed and eerie surprises, and like demons on mischief night, O' Nan's ghosts roam the suburban countryside, haunting the innocent and shedding light on unfortunate events.  <br /> <br />In the case of The Night Country, the unfortunate event is the one-year anniversary of a deadly car accident which has killed three-fourths of its teenage cargo. High school student, Tim, the only survivor left physically unscathed, is putting the pieces back together from the tragedy. The other teenagers who died - Danielle, Marco (the main narrarator) and Toe - show up in the novel as spirits, hovering into view when Tim recalls the incident. Kyle, another survivor, is now brain-damaged and unaware of what has happened to him. Tim and Kyle are united by the bond of survival, although both are changed by what has taken place.  <br /> <br />Brooks, the police officer who was first on the accident scene is haunted, not only by the senselessness of the tragedy, but also by his own secret about how the events had unfolded that night. Along with other minor characters - two hoodlums that plan their own prank for Halloween night and Kyle's depressed and defeated mother - these central figures are all on a race against time, and whether their goals are reliving the past or preventing the future, everyone gets a chance to examine their mistakes and possibly redeem themselves.  <br /> <br />In addition to a narrative, O'Nan's latest offering is also a detailed sketch of small-town life. The Connecticut town of Avon is rendered by the author, warts and all, from the commercialized strip with its Dunkin' Donuts, Danielle's former place of work, to the music that the kids were listening to - Smashing Pumpkins - on the night of the accident. There is little sophistication to Avon, and it's equally less quaint, despite its ghosts. Avon is the epitome of sprawl and development, current hallmarks of the American experience.  <br /> <br />Stewart O'Nan's style in The Night Country is reminiscent of Joyce Carol Oates in both its simplicity and its en pointe characterization of young adults in their suburban environment. Yet also like Oates, the writing occasionally veers into melodrama. But there are enough clever twists to hold off the soap operatic tenor. And due to its single minded focus of driving us onward to find out what Tim will do to remember tragedy he witnessed, the reader will tailgate Tim straight to the conclusion and won't be disappointed in the powerful ending.  <br />	2004-10-20

Reviewed by Colleen Hollister for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />First Desire has a soft and subtle lyricism of language that is reminiscent of Virginia Woolf at her best. But all of that has been said.  <br /> <br />This is a story about five adult siblings, their father, their Buffalo neighbors, and their late mother, whose absence is so palpable that she is a character herself. This is a simple framework, and a potentially simple story, about family and relationships. From the beginning, each character commands its own individual personality but also falls into place as a member of the family. Sadie is the capable young wife; Celia the fragile and childlike sister; Jo the brusque and independent one; Irving the youngest, fond of gambling, drinking and women. Their father, Abe Cohen, owns a successful jewelry store. Each member cannot possibly escape - they are all interlinked, one member described by the next, one responsible to another. Oldest sister Goldie, however, has tried to pull herself away. This is the image that opens the novel: Sadie standing in her front window, luxuriating in the quiet morning, watching Irving stride up her lawn to tell her Goldie is missing. This event sets up a ripple effect, touching every action and thought in a family already shaken from loss.  <br /> <br />At first glance this is a novel about women, flowers, tea. Her characters reveal their emotions through attacks on rose wallpaper and descriptions of clouds. As a novel, The First Desire is slow and unexciting. Most of the plot is laid out from the beginning, and there are few developments the reader would not have expected. But this is a writerly book, and the writing and structure serve to entrance the reader better than a dramatic plot would. Each chapter settles in the point of view of a single character and this circling from one character to another and then back creates a repetition that holds the novel together. The fact that many chapters have appeared in literary journals attests to their tight construction - they can stand on their own, and are thus complete stories in themselves.  <br /> <br />Thus focused, the work hones in on its central problem, what Reisman calls the fight between two \\"desires\\": the first the need to be connected to loved ones, to be recognized, accepted and comforted; the second to be invisible, independent, to hide. Goldie has successfully hidden herself, but the family suffers. Such a complicated problem creates a complicated, layered novel, told in pieces of time, pieces of consciousness, all woven together like strands of fine silk thread.  <br /> <br />The writing is so suited to the subject that Reisman's world, its problems and its emotions, stand fully upright in their vividness. The novel is infused with sadness, attuned to changes in the weather. The words are lush, paragraphs given the texture of a soft cashmere sweater. The time period, the late 1920s through the 1950s, is clearly evoked, using appropriate words like \\"davenport\\", without feeling heavy or dated. Accordingly, Buffalo is not just a setting, but a feeling, one solid piece of the novel's tone, much like the jigsaw puzzles Celia works to calm her distracted mind.  <br /> <br />The reader is drawn in by the novel's many pieces and how intricately they fit together. At Reisman's hand, what could be a simple story turns into an exposition of the many possible layers of sadness and loneliness, an exploration of what it means to be a family.  <br /> <br />Nancy Reisman is by no means an amateur, and The First Desire is, undoubtedly, a novel that lives up to its promise.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-20

Mangarella for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />A death in the family can be shattering, ripping hearts and creating tears for months afterward. Eventually, the closure of knowing a loved one is dead, where they are buried, the carving on their tombstone and the spoken memories that accompany each holiday slowly return life to normalcy. When a child goes missing and there is no sign of life or death or anything except a silence manufactured in Hell, it creates a monster that haunts a family, feeding on their love, drowning their emotions, causing them to look and search in places they have looked and searched so many times before. This haze befalls the Winters family in Amanda Eyre Ward's How To Be Lost, a novel that will share a bookshelf with Alice Sebold's renowned, The Lovely Bones. <br /> <br />The Winters sisters, fourteen year old Caroline, thirteen year old Madeline, and Ellie a bright, bubbly five year old, possess a bond that is tightened on a daily basis by the emotional slaughterhouse of their parent's marriage. Joseph is a failing businessman who manages to give them a prestigious lifestyle despite his uncontrollable anger. Isabelle, his wife, tries desperately to be mother to her three daughters but is really much too busy being Joseph's target. The girls are alone within the walls of their huge house, a place where arguments echo and the girls cringe in the aftershock of a brutal marriage.  <br /> <br />When Caroline accepts a date with young Jim O'Hara, Madeline and Ellie are excited and help her prepare for this momentous night. Jim is abruptly turned away at the door by Joseph, Caroline promptly rebels and is beaten by her father as her mother and sisters watch, too frightened to intercede. The sisters decide to pool their baby sitting money, steal the family Oldsmobile and run away from home. They take their time, carefully studying a Rand McNally Atlas and planning their escape. They decide on New Orleans after watching a rerun of \\"A Street Car Named Desire\\". Anything to get away from home. Away from their drunken, savage father and their weary and beaten mother.  <br /> <br />The girls make their escape on the last day of school. Caroline steals the Oldsmobile, picks up Madeline and they drive over to the elementary school where Ellie is supposed to meet them. Ellie isn't there. They ride through the streets looking for her but she's nowhere to be found. Madeline confesses to having an argument with Ellie so they head home, thinking their little sister has backed out of the plan. She's not at home. She is missing. And she stays missing, tearing the Winters family apart. Caroline, Madeline and Isabelle each blame themselves for Ellie's disappearance. It's a blame that emerges from some dark region that consumes the goodness from their days.  <br /> <br />Fifteen years later, Caroline is a cocktail waitress in New Orleans, Madeline has married and stayed in New York and Isabelle, their aging mother, remains in her condo, still searching for Ellie. They've searched for Ellie every day of their lives and have only found a deep hurt that, as Caroline puts it, shows them how to be lost. Caroline returns home for Christmas with her mom and sister, always a painful holiday because Ellie's ghost lives in the background. This Christmas is different because Isabelle shows Caroline a copy of People Magazine containing a photo of a grown up Ellie at rodeo in Montana. Caroline quits New Orleans, packs her car and heads for Montana hoping to locate Ellie. Hoping to learn if the girl in the picture is really her lost younger sister.  <br /> <br />Amanda Eyre Ward has written a delicately balanced book about the domestic horror and emotional battling that tears people apart inside. She also brings the strength of each character, Caroline, Madeline, Isabelle, Ellie, into every page. This delicacy is not a simple choice for a writer to make because it truly balances How To Be Lost in a manner that veryfew books achieve. This is not simply a tale about a missing girl. This is a parable about how a family can be lost from each other while searching for the one who is gone, the one who can cement them back together again. Anyone who reads Amanda Eyre Ward's How To Be Lost, will eagerly await her next book.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-18

Reviewed by Patty Payette for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />\\"You zip me up.\\" Daanish, a young Pakistani student, tries to explain to his secret lover, Dia, why he is compelled to seek out her company in Uzma Aslam Khan's new novel Trespassing. Torn between traditional familial and cultural expectations and his modern sensibilities, Daanish uses Dia to assuage his cultural confusion. Dia, determined to marry for love rather than convenience, seeks out Daanish as a soul mate despite the fact that he has been tapped as the suitable match for her best friend Nissrine.  <br /> <br />Khan sets the budding relationship during the tumultuous political and cultural context of Pakistan during the Gulf War. With elegant, precise prose, Khan fleshes out the margins of her story by moving back and forth in time and giving over the story telling alternately to Daanish and Dia as well as others close to the lovers, including their mothers. This narrative choice enlarges the scope of the novel, transforming this tale of star-crossed lovers into a story of cultural crisis.  <br /> <br />Much to her credit, Khan is interested in dismantling stereotypes and starts with her leading lovers. The novel opens as Daanish is called back home to Kaarachi from his college studies in the United States for his father's funeral. His semesters in \\"Amreeka\\" have been liberating, although he questions his choice of a journalism career and his ability to be the dutiful son that his father expected and his mother now needs. Introspective and sullen, loyal and creative, Daanish is an eligible, albeit moody, bachelor. Dia is the spirited daughter of a nontraditional mother who is helping her mother run her silk farm and factory while dreaming of a life beyond her circumscribed sphere. Their relationship becomes a convenient escape from the stressors of their individual pasts, presents and their looming, uncertain futures.  <br /> <br />Khan surprised and impressed this reviewer by bringing their relationship to an abrupt end with a whimper, not a bang. After their trysts are discovered, Daanish drops Dia rather than whisk her back to America. Her love complicates his burgeoning new role as his mother's provider and husband-to-be of her best friend. Their last telephone call ends with awkward silences that are as true-to-life as the bickering and kissing that marked their secret meetings. The disappointments, secrets and unspoken expectations that swirl around Daanish and Dia and their friends and family members make the title of this novel resonate with real life complexities.  <br /> <br />Trespassing spins out an intricate web of relationships while illustrating the ways in which we trespass against ourselves and each other as we grapple with a rapidly changing world and grasp for something or someone to anchor us.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-15

While I'm not privy to use the overused term \\"unflinching\\" but for some reason, that fits here for Tara Bray Smith's rather impressive debut.

Bray deftly weaves the stories of her ancestors and Hawaiian traditions to the current day narrative - Bray's determined search for her heroin-addicted mother, Karen, through the gritty streets of Chinatown and downtown Hawaii. Because of a sustaining drug habit (Karen has an affinity for heroin but will sample others), the author's mother abandons Bray and her two sisters but manages to drop in and out of their lives, evoking pain and complex love from the daughters.

Larry Portzline realized the beginnings of a movement and in the summer of 2003 organized a Pennsylvania college group to visit to several bookstores around Greenwich Village.

He covers every possibility, from invitations/reservations, how to choose locations, methods of travel, and fun activities to do on the way. As for destinations, he offers descriptions of his favorite bookstores around the country, as well as methods for researching new places. He clearly loves bookstores of all kinds, and while he recommends researching places before visiting, he loves the thrill of finding hidden treasures and urges participants to be open to all possibilities.  <br /> <br />Many independent bookstores, faced with high rents, low readership and competition from larger, more commercial stores, have closed in recent years. These bookstores are not merely businesses, but barometers of local cultures and environments for personal enrichment and learning.

Reviewed by Sarah Morris for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Thanks to Rochelle Jewel Shapiro, I have discovered that I'm a psychic. In fact, I now think that most readers have a bit of mysticism within. Since reading Miriam the Medium, Shapiro's debut novel published earlier this year, I've been stricken with the idea that authors and readers are linked by their common desire to invent whole worlds and lives, that authors begin the transmission and readers pick up the signal, welcoming images and characters like truths that unfold on the screen of the reader's own third eye. Maybe our abilities aren't quite on par with those of phone psychic Miriam Kaminsky, but we readers are visionaries, connected through webs of words strung together that combine to bring a character to life.  <br /> <br />And Shapiro's Miriam certainly lives. Amid the muted tones of her image-obsessed hometown of Great Neck, New York, Miriam's colorful personality shines. Though not always welcome by her neighbors or her family, Miriam and her psychic abilities, along with the spirits of two or three dead relatives who regularly stop in to chat, add a definite verve to suburban New York. While her neighbors have their roots done and trip around in their Manolos, Miriam slings a tapestry bag over her shoulder and pops open her parasol as she strolls around in the sun. She's not affecting an image to drum up business; she is struggling to live true to herself.  <br /> <br />Getting comfortable with your true self is the central issue of Miriam the Medium. Shapiro uses the unique framework of psychic ability to inform a common theme that is carried throughout the novel. Miriam, her husband and daughter, and even the book's marginal characters all struggle with the definitions imposed upon them and those they've adopted for themselves. Even the book's title alludes to this, labeling Miriam a medium when she has always called herself \\"plain old Miriam the Psychic.\\" Miriam is called a medium onlybriefly in the book, yet the idea of being imposed upon by others' definitions is fundamental to the novel's cohesion. Societal norms and family expectations merge with self-image, dictating the characters' actions and often making their decisions for them. For Miriam, trusting in her own abilities in spite of her mother's constant disapproval and her daughter's disbelieving scorn opens her up to confidently explore the full extent of her psychic abilities.  <br /> <br />Shapiro skillfully weaves together the complex effects of past experiences upon personal insecurities and adeptly reveals the struggle to just be. Whether readers embrace the novel's supernatural philosophy, they will have no trouble embracing Miriam, a character of warmth and substance, with some good-natured quirks thrown in. Miriam the Medium is a strong debut from an author who writes with passion and conviction.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-05

Dierbeck captures the energy and emotions of the 1970's with startling resonance. She evokes a time when everything was allowed, when parents felt free to abandon their children and seek their own more selfish joy, and teenagers looked to rock bands like Led Zeppelin for philosophy and life instruction. In Dierbeck's 70's, sexual permissiveness was deemed necessary exploration, it was argued by the culture to be something healthy and desired. Men and boys used this rationale to lure girls like Alice into sexual relationships they were too young to want and too scared and confused to speak out about, and Dierbeck painstakingly mines the treacherous horror fashioned at the hands of these predatory lotharios.  <br /> <br />After her mother leaves to \\"pursue joy\\" and her father seeks refuge in a Connecticut mental hospital, Alice is left in the care of her half-sister, whom she calls Aunt Esme. In the history of literature, Aunt Esme surely ranks as amongst one of the most painfully ill prepared caretakers entrusted to monitor the safety of a child. While Aunt Esme is just a teenager herself, she is remarkably selfish and spends her days getting high with friends and lovers in her attic bedroom, which she has dubbed the \\"Dollhouse.\\" Several of these lovers sexually abuse Alice, including the creepy hanger-on named Rabbit and a petulant rock star called Crash Omaha. After being sent to an art camp in North Carolina for the summer so that Aunt Esme can follow Crash Omaha to Los Angeles, Alice arrives to discover that the camp is barely operating, with only a skeleton staff and a handful of callous students in attendance. A sinister drug dealer named J.D. quickly slithers into Alice's life, engaging her in an ongoing debate about her innocence, sexuality, and adulthood that lasts throughout the rest of the novel, ultimately leading to a scene of drug-induced horror - a rabbit hole from which Alice will not emerge the same.  <br /> <br />Using the outlines of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Dierbeck casts a mesmerizing sense of unreality to One Pill Makes You Smaller. She hews closely the characters and moods of the classic text, while reconfiguring it to suit the themes of her unique tale. Dierbeck has maintained the same sense of wonder combined with fear that Lewis Carroll so inventively created for his Alice, and yet Dierbeck confidently branches beyond Carroll's surreal characters, imbuing her spooky twins, mercurial rabbit, and grinning Cheshire with the concreteness and peculiarity needed to craft this fierce and haunting work of fiction. The reader never knows what twisted situation Alice might encounter around the next turn, and it is precisely this sense of adventure and trepidation that drives the narrative while also allowing the story to thoughtfully inquire into the dangerous nature of permissiveness and the dark side of freedom. Dierbeck has initiated great art from a wild time of heedless freedom, creating a tremendously disturbing novel with strong emotional impact.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-05

Inside, Jonathan Rosen shows us that just as every fingerprint is different, so is ever anorexic's struggle with the disorder. <br /> <br />Ruth and Joseph are Columbia grads living together in New York. Ruth's mother, a self-involved film scholar, and her remarried, benefactor father have been absent from Ruth's life since sending her off to boarding school as a teenager, where her anorexia developed. Joseph, through whose eyes of love and rescue we see Ruth, is still fighting his own demon- the guilt of his sister's suicide that he believes he could've prevented. At first Joseph limits his involvement to watching Ruth's eating habits and reading her diary. When she begins binging and purging he delves deeper into the mystery of anorexia to be her personal savior. Instead of going to the source, Ruth, he goes to the library to read every book on eating disorders, however clinically or culturally dense they may be. But his research doesn't provide any answers for him- it only sparks more questions: <br /> <br />But why were women the shock troops in this war against human  <br />nature? Were they more bound to reproductive nature and  <br />therefore in more conspicuous revolt against it? And why, if  <br />repressive Victorian society had forced submerged appetites into  <br />unhealthy irruptions, did the sexual revolution of the 1960's in  <br />America unleash even more cases of anorexia? <br /> <br />Dr. Flek, a friend of Ruth's mother and former psychoanalyst tries to lead Joseph to the truth, and back to Ruth. After Joseph gets lost in the emotionless theories, Flek tells him, <br /> <br />The language of food. The Primitive language that truly shapes us  <br />and that we can never escape. That is the language you will have to  <br />learn if you are going to understand her... learn thelanguage of the <br />body. The language of blood and bone and appetite. The body is  <br />our one great book.  <br /> <br />After Ruth follows Joseph to the library and watches him research, she begins to trust him the way she never could with anyone else but always wanted. First she has to make Joseph see her again, not the disease, as he is still a frustrated, clueless outsider. Only Ruth can set him straight and tell him that when you are anorexic \\"You're not thinking. Your body's going Food Food Food, and your brain's going No No No.\\" <br /> <br />At the heart of this book is a man who loves the inside and out of a woman who doesn't know how to love herself. Eating disorders remain a haunting mystery, even to those who are so close, but Rosen shows us that love never hurts.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-01

Mangarella for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />There's a powerful piston in American engine that often goes unnoticed until night covers the land. We see the tip of this iceberg in the face of the convenience store clerk or the gas station attendant battling boredom between customers. Martha Gies' Up All Night is a solid book that takes a peek behind night time's curtain at all those people who choose to live their lives after the sun goes down.  <br /> <br />The night worker. The female cabby slicing through the toughest neighborhoods. The cop whose sirens punctuate the darkness. The EMT crew rushing toward the emergency room. The nude dancer. The longshoreman. And countless others who eat lunch at midnight and supper at dawn while living on a river of industrial strength coffee. Gies utilizes their distinct voices to draw us into the dark hours when graveyard America punches a nocturnal time clock and goes to work.  <br /> <br />Up All Night is different even from the first story concerning Sativa, the nude dancer. It's certainly not about the \\"glamour\\" of nude dancing but more about a woman that happens to work in the nude for a living. The elements of Sativa's life that deliver her to the naked stage are the depth Ms. Gies wants us to examine. And each story- story being such an inadequate word as it implies fiction- possesses the same verbal power giving each page a soundtrack. You can hear the background noise, or quiet, of Portland after hours.  <br /> <br />The night people posses a strength that differs from their rigidly structured daytime counterparts. For example, there's an interesting similarity of devotion between Emma Bosco who oversees the perpetual adoration of the Eucharist at St. Agatha's Church and longshoreman Bruce Lyngstad who drives a massive crane on the Portland docks. Emma's religious devotion is every bit as tenacious as Bruce's adept handling of the crane as he swings huge containers high above other dockworkers whose lives are always at risk.  <br /> <br />We spend time with the computer genius who peels back the mystery of late night tech support while leaving the mystique. The phone tech's story is timely because thousands of those jobs are being outsourced to overseas locations. In a sense, you can almost hear the clock ticking on that job and Ms. Gies has managed to capture his voice before politics and economy extinguishes it. She brings us into the oncology ward where the charge nurse has the heartbreakingly hopeful job of caring for children with cancer. The twenty-two year old manager of the all night pool hall might not be \\"The Hustler\\" but his fervent reverence for pool as a game as well as a way of life is every bit as distinctive as a reverberating break shot. We go from hospital to truck stop to taxi cab to police car to radio station to a host of places where there's light in the darkness and people spend those hours bringing the grave yard shift to life.  <br /> <br />Martha Gies is a savvy writer whose sophisticated eye for detail allows Up All Night to become an oral history rather than a volume of overnight anecdotes.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-01

Reviewed by Gabriel Welsch for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />A lot of writers look for metaphors for the writing life, or writing task. Myself, I am guilty of waxing on about how gardening is like writing. A friend and serious foodie makes the connection between being a poet and being a chef. Most readers can think of a few more. Jennifer Lawler has given us all yet one more metaphor, comparing writer to a martial artist. Perhaps it is the novelty of the comparison, as most writers I know are soft, couch potato sorts who tend to stay away from places where they can get hit, or perhaps it is simply the force of her case, but she is convincing.  <br /> <br />Which says something. Writers do not suffer any shortage of books telling us how to do what we do, books running from annoyingly careerist checklists to breathless would-be eloquence on the nobility of the misunderstood artist's journey. At the same time, most writers stick with an avowed classic for inspiration or guidance, such as Dorothea Brand's On Being a Writer or John Gardener's The Art of Fiction. While the last decade has seen a number of books frank in tone and, in content, a compromise between meditation and checklist, books like Betsey Lerner's The Forest for the Trees, few have come from as deep left field as Lawler's.  <br /> <br />A veteran writer on a number of subjects aside from (and including) martial arts, Lawler writes on the craft and profession of writing, for the most part, with some work on creativity, inspiration, the art, and so forth. Her tone stays friendly and concise, but not chatty. As the book's title implies, it is organized in lessons or forms-extensions of the dojo metaphor-one hundred such short pieces, accompanied with exercises, suggestions of actions the reader can take.  <br /> <br />The root of Lawler's tone might be the assumption guiding the book, namely that most of its readers look to become freelance writers working across a number of genres and tasks, and hope to support themselves. While she does frequently assert that not all writers have the same goals, the majority of the lessons focus on freelancer issues. For instance, the exercise for lesson 64, \\"Strive for Mastery,\\" suggests \\"occasionally, don't settle for competent work,\\" a line that took me back the first time I read it. She clarifies in the next sentences, stating that she means contracted writers should strive for work which is perfect, beyond the pale, before turning it into the editor or publisher who commissioned the job. It's good advice, but advice that makes sense for only one kind of writer.  <br /> <br />Then again, Lawler might feel someone who resolutely sticks to a single genre or mode is limiting herself. As she writes, in lesson 42, \\"The Way is not always straight,\\" avoidance of other genres and other modes of writing may well shortchange you on your particular path to writing success (another notion she qualifies broadly). Other lessons focus on reading books like hers, or style manuals and guides to freelancing, once a month, and on how to pump contacts such as employers and local businesses to sell your talents as a writer for their needs.  <br /> <br />But when Lawler is at her best, making clear connections between martial arts practice and corollary ideas in writing, the book surprises and makes very good sense. When she admonishes to seek the \\"target beyond the target,\\" readers envision the fist moving through a board, aimed at a spot behind it, so that the board breaks easily with the strike. The translation to writing is to think not simply about publishing a piece, but about what the publication might lead to, how the publication helps get a person closer to her writing goals. When she advises \\"don't give away your moves,\\" she talks about how keeping one's best moves give her the advantage and focus in a sparring match. For writers, it's not chatting up one's best ideas, not talking about writing instead of doing it, letting the tension of withholding help drive the work. When Lawler says \\"catch sight of your reflection,\\" the literal lesson is for martial artists to practice before a mirror, to understand the entirety of their moves during movements and forms, to ensure the best execution. For writers, she means to have the ability to step back, regard one's work, and understand the moves working within it-a task helpful not only for revision but for conception and composition as well.  <br /> <br />One of the most intriguing points is her notion, \\"don't allow the opponent to control match,\\" in which she details how a martial artist wants not to be on the defensive. In a sparring match, she will try to anticipate, be confident in her ability to react, to let the fight flow without overwhelming her, accepting triumphs and setbacks as part of the whole. If she can't control the tempo and timing of the fight, she will at least not be controlled by it. For writers, it means not letting rejection, setbacks, inconsideration, and other factors derail them from their purposes. By removing the notion that a spar is a fight, and then using that idea to leap to publishing not being a necessarily antagonistic arena, the advice (as well as the other lessons similar to it) can serve to renew a writer's enthusiasm and conception of the publishing world.  <br /> <br />Finally, Lawler also takes on the standard bits of advice-heart is more important than talent, other genres can teach you much about your chosen one, teachers and supporters are important, being a writer means sitting down and writing and not hanging out at readings professing your pending brilliance or warbling about how you're so damned interested in process. But just as happens in a good poem or story, the setting and metaphors that accompany an old story or idea make it interesting again. And given the plain-talk of this particular warrior, not only are the ideas new again, they come at you with such force that I have to wonder just what Lawler'starget behind the target might be.  <br /> <br />	2004-09-23

Glixman for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />I never liked comics in any form. I avoided the syndicated Brenda Star and Pogo. I ignored Archie comic books. Batman was never on my reading list. Since I read the graphic novel, City of Glass, the 2004 adaptation of his 1994 story in New York Trilogy, all that has changed.  <br /> <br />For those not familiar with this literary form, graphic novels are literary hybrids, a combination of film noir, and comic book. There are the same narrative sequential panels as in comic books, the same stylized images and icons; however, in graphic novels the comic form is no longer only funny. These novels are stories of loss, loneliness, and existential angst. They echo the tone of post world war film noir where suspicion, fear, alienation, and suspense fill the screen.  <br /> <br />City of Glass, named one of the 100 best comics of the century, is the story of mystery writer Daniel Quinn. Since his wife and young son died he has become a recluse. One night in his solitude the phone rings. It is the wrong number. The phone rings again. The caller Virginia Stillman is looking for Paul Auster of the Paul Auster Detective Agency. She wants to hire Auster to protect her mentally disturbed husband Peter from his father who will soon be released from prison. Peter received a threatening letter from his father. Peter Stillman Senior was incarcerated for abusing his son (he beat him when he spoke) while using him as part of a linguistic research project. Quinn decides with the encouragement of the fictional detective Max Work, the narrator of his own mystery novels, to take on the case pretending to be the detective Paul Auster.  <br /> <br />Quinn finds the senior Stillman. He follows him, waits outside his hotel in an alley to make sure he does not get to the son.  <br /> <br />Quinn spends days watching. Stillman never leaves the hotel or does he? Quinn grows disheveled, eats little, loses weight, does not sleep, or bathe. He runs out of money. He finds the real Paul Auster and asks him to cash the check Virginia Stillman gave Quinn at their initial meeting as an advance. But the Auster Quinn finds is not the detective. He is the author Paul Auster. Regardless, he will cash the check. Apropos for a book where reality is hazy.  <br /> <br />Eventually Quinn gives up. He learns the senior Stillman killed himself. Virginia and Peter Stillman are nowhere to be found. Quinn returns home to find his apartment has been rented. Quinn's previous life as he knows it disappears; people are now dead or missing. Emptiness prevails. Identities are fragile. The stark graphics echo this disintegration.  <br /> <br />The illustrations by Paul Karasik, whose work has been in the \\"New Yorker\\" (also former associate editor of \\"Raw Magazine\\"), and David Mazzucchelli, internationally known comic book artist, create moods and interior emotions that raise comics to the art of serious fiction for adults.  <br /> <br />In this new introduction to City of Glass, Art Spiegelman, the guru of comic book artist and recipient of The Pulitzer Prize for his graphic novel Maus, says Mazzucchelli and Karasik: \\"have created a strange doppelganger of the original book\\" and a \\"a breakthrough work.\\"  <br /> <br />	2004-09-22

There is so much history, so much richness of culture, and so many different varieties of sadness. It is not surprising, then, that so many of the writers who make Prague their subject tinge their works with despair and darkness; it seems almost natural, tradition. Aaron Hamburger's book of short stories, The View from Stalin's Head, is no exception. Hamburger, however, goes a step further, combining bleakness and shadow with an eye for the unique and absurd, creating what is ultimately a sensitive and funny portrait of the city and its inhabitants.  <br /> <br />Clearly drawn to Prague as place and subject, Hamburger infuses his stories with the feel of Prague itself, specifically in the post-Cold War 1990s. His details are finely drawn and evocative: the shades of black, white and concrete; the smell of smoke, beer and frying food; the pollution that is so omnipresent that it affects mood and personality, such as that of the main character in \\"A Man of the Country.\\" The stories are thus firmly grounded in setting, the city fully captured.  <br /> <br />Besides Prague, Hamburger's subjects are clear: the outsider, the foreigner, the alienated and lonely. His characters are tourists, expatriate teachers, a theology student throwing all his heart into his conversion to Judaism, and one teenage boy whose mother dresses him in frilly clothes. This is one flaw that makes the book verge on repetitive: many of his characters fit neatly under the heading of sexually confused Jewish expatriate, variations on a single type. If Hamburger were truly trying to capture the full essence of a city from all corners of life, there are many missing elements. The reader may come away wondering if that is all there is. Having chosen such a theme, however, Hamburger doesit well, exploring the situations and emotions involved with a sensitivity that never becomes saccharine or morose. His characters speak honestly, like \\"A Man of the Country\\"'s young teacher, who is \\"horribly lonely now, not just for love, but for people to tell everything that's bubbling inside me in full-blown, gorgeously complicated language, with the generosity of a big portion.\\" This man's deep loneliness is offset by his ridiculous, but poignant, relationship with a young Czech \\"giant\\" who loves the color yellow and wishes to take a picture of the other man's nose.  <br /> <br />Hamburger is true to the complexity of his characters' lives and emotions, capturing them fully and deeply, without forcing them to wallow in despair. His appreciation for the strange and comical is what shines through. The description of romance in \\"Jerusalem,\\" is funny, stuttering and complicated, as it would truly be, not perfect and shining; the descriptions of Stalin's head and its new residence at the bottom of the river, in the title story, are absurd and clever, the mark of a good storyteller.  <br /> <br />In reading these stories, Hamburger's talent for both writing and observation is obvious. He sees detail, character, emotion, and captures them well. The reader wishes, however, that he would take this talent further. He could do more, write a greater range of characters, veer a bit more from the stodgy smoke-filled darkness, expand on the small bits of absurdity he does include. He is, though, remarkably successful with what he has done, with the portrait of Prague he has lovingly and believably created, and with this debut collection promises a strong career ahead.  <br />	2004-09-21

There are many examples of work that blurs the line between nonfiction and fiction, memoir and novel, upright citizen and (...)child.     The only question anyone who reads such an admixture should care about is: Does the author transform the highly personal into something universal?     For the most part, Diane Payne's memoir/novel hybrid Burning Tulips does.     The books only flaw is the putrid, one-note character of the father, who not only is the Vietnam War-loving stereotype of the union thug and domestic tyrant, but just happens to sexually molest his daughters, too. There may be such monsters in real life, but, at least in this instance, it doesn't make for compelling fiction. After a few run-ins with him, you're already desensitized. It's not that the author should have included some sappy detail about his secret hobby of raising orphaned bunnies, it's just that once you get to the chapter where he's in the garage slaughtering rabbits you're already so saturated with his malice that all you can do is chuckle and say, \\"Ho hum.\\"    The father, though, is really nothing but a foil for the main relationship of the book between the terminally ill mother and her bridge-over-troubled-water daughter.     When Dad touches me, I can tell that he doesn't hate me, and I don't hate him. I don't hate him until he gets out of bed and starts screaming at my mother before he goes to work, once again making me invisible, forgetting that he was happy just moments ago.    The mother and daughter cling to each other like two tourists who've been abducted by a terrorist long enough to start making excuses for him, exhibiting the classic symptom of Stockholm Syndrome. In the chapter titled \\"The Trash Bin\\", the mother admonishes her daughter to not think too harshly of a vagrant bum who copped a feel. It's as if she's indirectly apologizing to her daughter for ignoring her husband's incestuous ways.    \\"It won't look good to say my daughter was touched by an old man. From now on, stay away from old men. They get like that. Don't you go telling anyone what he did. ... Some things need to stay in the family.\\"     Adding to the ambiguous nature of this memoir/novel is the fact the chapters can also be looked upon as stand alone short stories, autonomous in their own right, even as they work within the larger frame of the book. In the story, \\"The Keyhole\\", the young girl spies on her post-mastectomy mother preparing to bathe.    Mom's skin is red and raw, crusted with wounds that will become thick scars. Blood drips from the stitches. She looks bruised and off balance, but not untouchable.    The daughter's impulse to mother her mother overrides her fear of being pushed away, and she opens the door and walks into the bathroom. Over the protestations of her mother, the girl picks up the soap and begins to wash her mother's back.    \\"You're too young to see this.\\"  \\"I saw it through the keyhole, Ma. It ain't that bad.\\"   \\"Are you sure?\\"   \\"Yeah.\\"     As the daughter hits her teen years, she becomes a self-described 'Jesus Freak' who in the story/chapter, \\"Tongue-Tied\\" tries to proselytize at a crash pad inhabited by bikers.    \\"You know, I was wondering if the Road Knights might like to get involved with my church. You know, start a club called Jesus' Mufflers, or something like that.\\"    The big man spits out his beer laughing. Leaning over the kitchen table, he pounds another guy on the shoulder, the one who is waiting for him to get back to their poker game, and says, \\"Did you hear that? She wants us to start a motorcycle club called Jesus' Mufflers!\\"    Bouncing from tragedy to comedy and a little bit of inbetween, these stories casually intertwine to create a lushly colored, painstakingly-rendered portrait of a family, their community, and the unsettled times in which they live.	2004-09-17

Reviewed by Jennifer Leblanc for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />One of the forefathers of grunge has gone political. Krist Novoselic, former bassist for Nirvana, has written a book entitled, Of Grunge and Government: Let's Fix This Broken Democracy! <br /> <br />As he chronicles his punk/grunge days in Washington we follow his trail into politics. First are the anti-desert storm concerts that Nirvana played and the youth-driven 1992 election. But the real influence came when Novoselic had a hand in defeating the Erotic Music Law in 1992, which labeled certain albums for Adult's Only. In 1995 the same law under a different name brought Novoselic to the state house, the legislature, working with lobbyists and the governor for another victory. He was hooked enough to start JAMPAC, Joint Artists & Music Promotions Political Action Committee, which supports pro-music and free speech candidates for office.  <br /> <br />The later chapters explain certain aspects of government and elections in thorough and accessible but not condescending ways. He explains Super-Party Districts, Instant Run-off Voting and the possible reforms for elections. He doesn't just bemoan the fact that not al votes count; he has ideas to make that change.  <br /> <br />Novoselic does not simply spout off his anger at the government or America's political flaws. Through the years he used his anger as motivation for change, not inertia, and found a calling in public office (he is currently running for Lieutenant Governor of Washington State). Although he loves a good rally just as much as the next activist, he has learned first hand that more can be done inside the system than outside.  <br /> <br />Though lacking the spontaneous excitement of a street march, testifying at a public hearing is another opportunity to constructively get something off your chest. Regardless of the approach, the idea is to address attempts at tyranny in the nonviolent context of the democratic process. That's what theU.S. is supposed to be about. <br /> <br />He also advocates involvement at any level. He outlines the benefits of public hearings, old-fashioned local lodges like the Elks and Grange, which he is a member of, and also highlights message boards, weblogs and meet-ups. <br /> <br />The best thing about this book is Novoselic's refreshing hope about the future. He often quotes the American founders, the constitution, and speaks from the heart about enjoying the freedoms we all take for granted, like voting and participation. He writes early on: \\"I am actually very enthusiastic about American Democracy and the possibilities for real change. It's just a matter of getting word out.\\" With all the current political controversy brewing at home and abroad, he has picked the perfect time to do so. <br /> <br />	2004-09-15
US	49474042	R6OJCBRXV9UXP	1931561419	452277723	In a Temple of Trees: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	N	a refreshing & intelligent debut	Reviewed by Krista McGruder for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />In A Temple of Trees by Suzanne Hudson is refreshing and intelligent in the author's refusal to bow to the namby-pamby literary review chorus. This chorus is sung in praise of novels that shade all the characters with goodness and badness, incorporating review buzzwords such as compassionate and humanizing without any justification for the normative value of that authorial inclination (other than not to offend the purchasing public.) Praise of a literary author's \\"compassion\\" toward humanity is already a clich and is close to becoming a pandemic love-fest, in which no humans-fictional or otherwise-are ever condemned or ever to blame because, hey, we should recognize there's an evil in all of us and while we're at it, please pass the syrupy milk of human kindness. <br /> <br />Thank god or the muse-take your pick-for Suzanne Hudson. Her novel, In A Temple of Trees, a break from her long writing hiatus, features bad characters. Meaning, characters that behave badly, characters that are more flawed than good and characters that are evil. Meaning, also, the author has shrugged off the contemporary literary requirement that novels should underscore humanity and limn motivations in the socio-economic context of youth and while we're at it, what about that relationships with mother? <br /> <br />Whatever. And what a relief that this talented Southern woman has produced a good fire and brimstone type fiction that doesn't shirk from judging who's a sinner and who's a saint. Temple contains villains and good people and saves plenty of nuance for the ones in between. For nuance, Suzanne Hudson focuses primarily on the life of Cecil Durgin, a man who struggles with fidelity toward his wife but who also acts out of conviction in his efforts to bring out the black vote for local causes.  <br /> <br />Cecil's story begins in Alabamian timber baron Big John McCormick's deer camp. For those unfamiliar with Southernmale hunting rituals, a \\"deer camp\\" is usually a cabin tucked deep into the woods outfitted with a card table, latrine, kitchen and in these days, an audio-video system to help pass the time when not crouched in a deer blind. Befitting the era and setting of the early parts of Temple, Big John's buddies come to the camp prepared with dogs, guns and liquor. And of course, the help. The help consists of an older black man who cooks and a \\"mixed\\" boy named Cecil Durgin. Of uncertain paternity, Cecil has been adopted by a local couple in which the wife, Miss Sophie Price, is Jewish. After spying on the sex games between the white adult hunters and the white women hired for the purpose, Cecil discovers her dead body and informs Big John. Miss Charity's death will metaphorically and literally haunt Cecil throughout his adulthood.  <br /> <br />Cecil's adulthood is set in 1990, again in Three Breezes, Alabama. He is married, his children have grown and left. Cecil owns the radio station his adoptive father had operated. Cecil's admonitions to his listeners are the source of political trouble for the good ole' boys running Big John McCormick's timber trust. Hudson manufactures the local political intrigue and jockeying deftly, framing out conflict with specific scenes to illustrate the persistence of small-town political muscle jobs that can carry large financial consequence.  <br /> <br />Concurrent with Cecil's marital and potentially dangerous political dilemma are the moral struggles of other characters including Sophie Price, his wife, Earline and his long-time friend, a white woman named Shug who is part-heir to the timber fortune. Cecil's mistress, a velvet-throated crooner who calls herself Honey, falls into misadventure and the tale of her ordeal is both screamingly funny and grim. Even the ghost of the dead young woman makes appearances, tempering the scenes with reminders that Cecil's past walks the walk with his present.  <br /> <br />Hudson writes local color and details that make her \\"bad\\" characters easy-if not fun-to imagine. Included in the raft of good ole' boys are Big John's hunting contingent (among them a friend and confidant who had relations with his daughter,) Shug's husband and a comic-relief duo of brother criminals. Hudson's exceptional at assigning identity to each of the characters. Though all white and all bad, we never confuse the embezzler with the kidnapper, the hinted-at-gay good ole' boy with the waspy, porn-loving, Christian financial manager.  <br /> <br />Temple doesn't shrink from the elephant in the room. Race and issues of racial paternity command as much stage time as the characters and dramatic conflict. Notions of family and friendship are strained over the facts of Cecil's paternity; both his black and white families are reluctant to tell what they know as truth. Bitterness runs deep on both sides of the white and black family branches.  <br /> <br />If Temple has any soft spots, it lies in Hudson's dedication to preserving dialect and speech mannerisms. Though accuracy in depiction has always been a strong suit of Southern writers, she opens herself to potential criticism that she's writing the \\"stock\\" evil white man or the \\"clich\\" rich, drunken and imperious Southern widow. I didn't find the characterizations to be a problem, but that's probably because I've spent too much time arguing with Northern literary critics that despite their claims of hunters and belles being \\"caricatures,\\" people in the South...really...do....talk...like...that. And act like that too.  <br /> <br />Readers should enjoy Hudson's novel, if not only for the unraveling of its decades-long mystery but for a tour through the woods of the South, where they'll encounter \\"The faint smell of must wool, cedar-chipped smoke, and sticky sap....\\" <br /> <br />And also bad guys. No-possibility-of-compassion-or-humanizing bad guys.  <br /> <br />	2004-09-14
US	49474042	R1ICCO31N8GUPU	1888451637	652596133	Since You Ask	Books	4	6	8	N	N	an elegant debut	Reviewed by Colleen Hollister for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Louise Wareham's first novel, Since You Ask, speaks out of a tradition of fragile women poetically captured, of women both idealized and in trouble, caught in some version of a downward spiral. Wareham echoes Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton and Lolita, and works with subjects more often found in memoirs of depression and mental illness. There is room, however, for a novel like Since You Ask, because it is earnest and beautiful, because the voice at its center shimmers with truth.  <br /> <br />Betsy Scott has a wealthy and successful family, an exotic Antiguan background, a privileged private school existence. She's surrounded by rich friends, lush New York penthouses, silk, perfume, yachts and riding boots. Telling her story from within a Connecticut mental hospital, Betsy makes it clear that these rich trappings are mere gloss. At sixteen she has an affair with her boyfriend's 41 year-old boss; in her early twenties develops drug addictions spurred on by her older brother Raymond; throughout she teeters on the edges of health and sanity, unsure of every facet of her identity. Though long keeping it secret from her friends and family, Betsy early on reveals to the reader that Raymond molested her at age nine; the resulting conflicting feelings affect her every other interaction.  <br /> <br />Such a story of secrets, dysfunction and self-destruction could easily degenerate into clich. The characters surrounding Betsy are undeveloped, as if pulled from a pool of stock types. With the central events laid out for the reader from the beginning, the novel lacks narrative pull. It is Betsy and her own feelings that are the focus of the novel, however, and it is her voice that saves it. She feels `fragmented' and `broken'; Wareham's writing replicates these inner conflicts and emotions nicely, through the skips between paragraphs and time periods, the adding on of bits and pieces as the novel progresses. Descriptions that are sense- and color-driven, lyrical, soft, and reminiscing offset the darkness of the situations, adding to the complexity and giving us a clearer picture of the many factors involved in Betsy's personality.  <br /> <br />Some quirks of Wareham's writing style do become repetitive - an overuse of certain metaphors, the very similar description for every character, an awkwardness of flow especially in the first pages - but these are admirable attempts at creating a voice for her character. The repetition creates a consistency, a smoothness of speech that holds the novel together.  <br /> <br />Such factors make Since You Ask an easy read. Wareham's writing is uncomplicated, spare, perhaps even unsophisticated. These qualities do not work to dismiss its merit, but rather suit its purpose. Wareham has not set out to write a jarring emotional ride, an expos of personality and family dysfunction; she does not aim for cheap shock. Her style, slow and quiet as it is, makes for a book quickly read because it is compelling. Wareham's Betsy is perceptively and sensitively drawn. The descriptions are often beautiful, and the emotions feel solid and true to the situation. Despite its faults - and in some cases, perhaps because of them - Wareham's novel has succeeded. This is a strong and promising debut.  <br /> <br />	2004-08-30

Reviewed by Jennifer Leblanc for Small Spiral Notebook    Ginny Good is a page-turning memoir in which Gerard Jones paints a fascinating, sad story of San Francisco in the 60's.     Jones has written an ode to a real-life girl named Ginny Good, claiming he knows of proof that she was the first hippie. \\"There's a picture of her in the school paper at San Francisco State,\\" Jones claims, and the first use of the word \\"hippie was in the caption to that picture.\\" On New Years Eve in 1962 Jones and his friend Eliot Felton, a disturbed green beret, meet Good at a jazz club, not knowing the effect that chance meeting will have on their future, individually and together. Good is a child of divorce, a \\"goddamn icon,\\" a drunk, a rape victim and someone desperate for love in the turbulent 60's, which, as Jones explains, was not a good time for anyone, never mind someone with Ginny's troubles. But Jones and Felton can't help me drawn to, loving and taking care of Ginny Good for well over a decade. Her presence disturbs their relationships, their minds, their lives but Jones writes of her so affectionately that he obviously considers her worth every last trouble.    The characters go back and forth between being thoroughly unlikable in obnoxious, hippie ways or too sad and abused by life to arouse anything but pity. These weren't just a bunch of cartoon-ish hippies with flowers in their hair. These were people with pain and love and dreams who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.    The 60's were mainly about avoiding responsibility- everyone openly living rent free, raising even more dysfunctional children, and hurting those around them. But Jones's description of the time, down to the smallest details, is fresh and different from any other 60's portrait out there. He notes,    ...the whole hippie thing was over by 1966... It had nothing to do with the war or civil rights or free speech. All that riding around in flower power busses was the commercialization of the experience... all that was nothing but advertising by people who'd already taken acid to get other people to take acid, and by then the advertising was getting mistaken for what really went on. A few minds got blown on acid. That's it.    And speaking of acid, the sublime, mystical, breathtaking scene with Ginny in the woods on acid is worth buying this book alone. Although this is Jones's debut novel, je has a real flair for prose. Lines such as \\"chalk dust hovered in shafts of early morning sunlight\\" fill the tale with vivid images. For the writing, for the 60's, for Jones, and above all for Ginny, this book deserves to be read.	2004-08-26

Reviewed by Leslie Van Newkirk for Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />If she wore the latest couture instead of three dollar flip flops, she could be a fashionista. If she ordered Cosmos instead of \\"red eyes\\" and whiskey shots, she could be a sophisticated spy. And if she were beautiful, she'd have a shot at being a Bond-girl bombshell. But Queenie Sells is not any of these. She's an aging, dysfunctional, not-quite-hipster from Burning Grounds, Brooklyn, and courtesy of Louisa Luna in Serious As a Heart Attack, she's one of the most refreshing heroines to shamble into the mystery genre. Queenie drinks, smokes, passes out, and wears clothing pulled from a festering laundry bag. But Luna manages to make Queenie endearing, rather than annoying; and although occasionally Queenie's internal philosophies border on the nave, it's satisfying to follow a protagonist that has such confidence, yet still manages to do everything wrong (the antithesis would be the chick-lit heroine in so many novels today, who, despite her insecurity and bumbling foibles, somehow secures her own rightful position at the top of the career heap).  <br /> <br />Luna's third novel showcases Sells's unique ability to sniff out trouble wherever it brews. As Queenie says, \\"Sometimes people told Queenie things. She noticed it when she was in high school, even after she started going to Boston for day school with the rich kids; the kids in the neighborhood, the mill kids, would still find her, not ask for anything, just talk themselves hoarse, tell her all their secrets.\\" And of course, this characteristic makes her a perfect candidate for a reluctant private eye. But before Queenie can get her sleuth on, she's got other messes to make - getting fired, getting home, and getting wasted in that order. However, a happenstance meeting with her old friend Hummer gives her a second chance at making a few extra bucks. Her mission is to find out what has happened to his mistress, Paper Doll stripper Trigger Happy, who had disappeared the week before. As with the \\"mill kids,\\" Queenie's in her element at the Paper Doll and is able to wrangle some information from another stripper, Baby. But in Luna's words, \\"It was a little after ten, and Queenie made a professional decision that if she was going to do any more research for the night, she would have to be drunk.\\" This description sums up Sells's character throughout most of the novel, although her diversions into inebriation give Queenie, a kind of lucidity and purpose for her task, like Popeye when he eats his spinach to fight the bully Bluto.  <br /> <br />Written in the same sparse style as her previous endeavor, Crooked, Luna has a knack for characterizing the marginal - lost, deluded, crazy, and criminal people hovering on the fringes, bumming cigarettes from the rest of us. But whereas Crooked was engaging, if somewhat humorless, Queenie's comedic witticisms keep Serious As a Heart Attack from becoming too staid. Furthermore, like Jonathan Lethem and Collin Harrison's city nocturnes, Luna takes us on a Manhattan-Brooklyn detour, dragging us through neighborhood joints that we would not likely venture into without our literary guide. Yet this Brooklyn balladist doesn't philosophize. Her main character tells it like it is and most of it ain't pretty.  <br /> <br />At times, Ms. Luna's prose is repetitive. And occasionally, the reader may wish that there were a little more to the plot or that some of Queenie's unraveling threads actually turned into secondary storylines, instead of meandering and then fading away. But these are insignificant criticisms in light of a very entertaining book. I'm willing to bet that more than a few fans will follow Queenie's progress, if only to sit on the sidelines and hope that she gets her life together. Which begs the question for the future: if Queenie Sells ever cleaned up her act and became a more traditional protagonist, would she be nearly as much fun?  <br /> <br />	2004-08-10

Each poem in the collection captures a moment, a feeling, and preserves it with words that are fresh, unexpected, and perfect. Mark Yakich is bursting with talent, and this book richly deserves its selection for the National Poetry Series.  <br /> <br />Some of Yakich's poems are sparse, needing only a few words to pierce through to the marrow of experience. Others feel more dense, like there is more to say than can be managed by the medium of poetry.

Reviewed by Katherine Darnell, Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Star Craving Mad, a first novel from Elise Abrams Miller is a charming read. While it hews close to the conventions of so-called \\"chick lit,\\" the novel finds a pace and style all its own through the witty protagonist Maddy Braverman, an acerbic New York City first-grade teacher. Maddy is entranced with celebrities and she hungrily reads \\"Celeb File Weekly\\" for all the glamorous updates on her favorite stars. The novel gets its start when Lola Seabolt, the child of Hollywood's biggest couple, walks in to Maddy's classroom on the first day of a new school year. In short order Maddy becomes tangled up in the Seabolt's world and she launches a wild flirtation with the magnetic Mr. Seabolt. It doesn't take long before it is revealed that everything inside the Seabolt marriage is not as sunny as Maddy's treasured tabloid would have her believe.  <br /> <br />What distinguishes this novel from the rest of the chick lit pack is an above-average wit and bawdy sense of impropriety. A hilarious and candid appreciation for sex gives Star Craving Mad a tenor all its own. There's no delicate, romantic fade-out's in the bedroom and Elise Abrams Miller isn't afraid to humorously discuss the fluctuating heat levels of Maddy's pants. There is a glorious level of tongue-in-cheek wit operating at all times. Maddy has a vigorous aptitude for good-natured and boozy trouble, and she has never met a hot celebrity that she wouldn't like to bed. Somewhat predictably, Mr. Seabolt's charms prove too enticing to resist; even with Maddy's moral qualms about his being the father of her student, as well as his being married to the uber-shrew Mrs. Seabolt, Maddy finds herself in compromising situations with the hot movie star. The novel focuses on Maddy trying to balance a responsibility to herself, to the children's novel that she's recently started writing, the emerging feelings that her cute assistant teacher evokes, and the unreal, gilded way that Mr. Seabolt makes her feel.  <br /> <br />Miller is an apt writer, capable of weaving her narrative with wry moments of humor, which utilize gentle, knowing sarcasm. Clear moments of insight punctuate the narrative, like when Nick Seabolt comes to the school to retrieve his daughter, who has just broken her arm, and Maddy notes, \\"Although his expression is genuine, it strikes me as strange, because I've seen him exactly like this before - in Bluebell, the epic film, where his mistress dies giving birth to their secret love child.\\" Miller also possesses a strong visually descriptive eye, giving even her minor characters vivid traits. Mrs. Seabolt's sinister healer, Dr. Kiki Joypain, is described succinctly as looking like a Modigliani painting, \\"as if she were made of taffy and had been stretched into an unwieldy rope. The turquoise beads around her neck are the size of giant gum balls and look excruciatingly heavy, as if at any moment their weight alone could slice her head clean off her pashmina-clad shoulders.\\"  <br /> <br />Miller has dreamed up characters that are memorable and earnest, and even if the outcome feels a bit inevitable, the ride is still fun. Because these characters are flawed in ways that feel more real and compelling than Bridget Jones' measly ten extra pounds - Miller's characters in Star Craving Mad are a little slutty and a little grungy and authentically broke and embarrassed and earnest - it quickly becomes hard to put the book down. Even if you know that celeb-obsessed Maddy Braverman will indeed find her happily ever after, you'll find yourself wishing hard for it, reading on as the pages fly by, anxious to get to the part where her battles are won and she can finally fall into the arms of her true prince charming, winning redemption and becoming her own kind of star.  <br /> <br />	2004-08-03

Sullivan, Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Conspicuous consumption, obsessive meditations of cannibalism and its intricate ties to history, literature and art, are prominent themes in Sabina Murray's third book, A Carnivore's Inquiry. A Pen-Faulkner award-winner for the short story collection, The Caprices, Murray introduces us to the itinerant 23yr. old Katherine Shea, who has just arrived to the U.S. after time spent roaming through Europe. Amidst hipster protestors carting signs that read: COLUMBUS BLOODY COLUMBUS and COLUMBUS WAS A MURDER, Katherine encounters a Russian migr novelist, Boris Naryshkin. As quickly as they meet, they take up house together, and this begins our immersion in this elegant and fiercely engaging novel.  <br /> <br />As the story unfolds, the reader becomes more intimate with Katherine's detached persona from which we gather Is due greatly in part to a cold wealthy father who doles our impersonal presents like faxes, and on a trip to the zoo, he confesses, \\"I suppose I have to feed you.\\" Feeding is keenly appropriate when we meet Katherine's eccentric and heavily medicated mother who spikes her daughter's enemies' Halloween treats with anti-psychotic medication and delivers horrific tales about the bloody Donner party as if they were bedtime stories. The murky family history is deliberate on the part of the author and heightens a surprising and highly satisfying ending. Like mother, daughter becomes obsessed with cannibalism - musing over the works of Goya (notably \\"Saturn\\" from the Black Paintings - does Saturn, in his fear of death, devour the son that will assume his throne?), Gericault's \\"The Raft of the Medusa\\", the folktales of Hansel and Gretel, and other great works of literature (Melville & Poe) and history that revolve around this theme. Society's taboo is consistently praised by the narrator who considers cannibalism survival of the fittest in an American culture obsessed with goods and consumption.History and art is the brilliant mirror of man's natural and perhaps darker tendencies. The weak perish while the fittest thrive. <br /> <br />Through the course of the novel, Katherine moves to a small cabin Maine and then across the great plains of the Midwest to the ancestral burial grounds of New Mexico. A series of brutal murders follows her passage, and with deft narration and supremely elegant prose, Murray draws out the thinning margins of Katherine's sanity: her desperation for comfort and warmth, yet her need for survival. As the reader speeds towards the novel's climax, the threads of her family's true and frighteningly sinister history quickly unravel.  <br /> <br />In a wonderful blurb, Jonathan Ames relates the novel to Brett Easton Ellis' American Psycho. and he couldn't be more accurate as the two hold up society's obsession with greed, survival by any means necessary and the wonderfully calculated and controlled voice of Patrick Bateman is chillingly similar to Katherine Shea.  <br /> <br />	2004-07-28

This is not a cd for a party, dinner, reading or otherwise. This is a cd to be heard and combed through like poetry, and it?s worth every minute. The main instruments alone demand your complete attention- the claviola, toy piano, side whistle, Theremin, and Glockenspiel. Yes, the Swiss musical clock made famous by a Frasier episode. The overall sound is that of a demented circus (if you are afraid of clowns, this cd is not for you), sometimes reminding you of a puppet show (the lyrics in the booklet are attached to strings). At other times, such as in #5, ?Kiss Me You Brat? by Rick Moody, waltzes and carousels come to mind.  <br /> <br />One of the best songs, which sound most like an average song, is ?Blessing? by Denis Johnson. Unlike most others, this has a chorus, and I personally think that Johnson could give up his day job to write country music. Myla Goldberg, who could do the same to play the flute, wrote Golem, calling the fabled Jewish monster ?my sedimental Valentine.?  <br /> <br />The best song for the lyrics is by Dave Eggers, ?The Ghost of Rita Gonzalo?. His words don?t even need music:  <br /> <br />If I were a well I would want you to yell down my depths <br />Your voice booming,  <br />Echoing <br />My well is deep and black.  <br /> <br /> <br />This entertaining and exotic cd will certainly echo in your mind long after listening, which anyone will feel the need to do several times.  <br />	2004-07-22

Written each morning (or hung-over afternoon) Phipps mapped out her mind, body and city as a writer, woman and a New Yorker. <br /> <br />Her main theme is that of an urban female trying to reconcile her own creativity with the rushing modern world in which we live. Any writer reading these poems will feel as if Phipps has read their own hearts and expressed it for them. #19 is about escaping the daily grind with literature (Anne Rice and Allen Ginsburg, to be exact). #8 concerns ?things needing/ to be done needing/ mind space.? In #54 she communicates the fears of every female writer:  <br /> <br />Will there be time <br />To do my hair <br />Check my email <br />Write my opus <br />Have a baby <br />Acquire a career <br />Erase my doubts. <br /> <br />And then there is the eloquent simplicity of #26: ?Today is not a day for poetry.? We understand.  <br /> <br />Her New York Setting adds greatly to her poems when she describes her Chelsea neighborhood, the subway, even a movie set.  <br /> <br />Although not all of the poems fit into a certain mold, they still stand out on their own. In # 27, for instance, Phipps recounts the diversity of her ancestors, their choices and paths and their effect on her own existence. #44, one of the shorter and simple less complex poems, paints a picture of her cat sitting on her computer, which any pet owner will love.  <br /> <br />There are more universal pieces included. #23 and 27 deal with fears and regrets, respectively, that are both uniquely hers but commonly felt by everyone. Everyone has a place they wish they had stayed in or left; a person to love more or less; roads not taken in life.  <br /> <br />The refreshing feel about this collection comes from Phipps, fresh out of sleep, suddenly conscious, writing suddenly and honestly, not edited or influenced by a day load of thoughts and experiences. Each poem is the literary equivalent of seeing the poet without her make up and hair done. There is no hesitation. This is a woman going forward into day through her art.  <br /> <br />	2004-07-22

Sullivan, Small Spiral Notebook <br /> <br />Animals take center stage in the bewitching debut story collection, Animal Crackers. In these perfectly pitched eleven stories, Hannah Tinti navigates strange relationships, absurd and quirky human behavior, personal desires and obsession.  <br /> <br />In ?Reasonable Terms?, a team of African giraffes in proper union fashion draft a list of demands to a zookeeper including improved quality of life and a more exotic d?cor. Rather displeased with the slew of demands, the zookeeper publicly refuses to negotiate for ?he couldn?t have every species writing lists and such. What, for example, would the hippos demand? Or the wombats?? The crafty giraffes retaliate and initiate a media circus by faking their own death. What unravels are our capacity for fleeting hysteria and forget ? the obsession with scandal evasion and damage control. And when the photographers leave and the headlines subside, what is left are animals carted away to another zoo. In such beautiful Orwellian fashion, Tinti gives soul and individuality to these desperate creatures.  <br /> <br />In ?Home Sweet Home?, a dog is eyewitness to the undoing of a quiet neighborhood and its complex inhabitants. A bored and lusty housewife, Pat, grows frustrated after the death of her husband Clyde?s father leaves Clyde impotent. Left to her own devices, Pat takes up with her next door neighbor, Mr. Mitchell. A brief affair with a Venezuelan prostitute results with Mitchell?s son, Manuel. The death of the mother brings the strange boy who is most comfortable hiding sleeping in garbage bins, to the Mitchell home and soon a surprising connection occurs between the child and Mrs. Mitchell, leaving the father to the wayside. Adultery and public indiscretions lead to a satisfying climax. <br /> <br />Dark human behavior is paramount and constructed beautifully by Tinti in the powerful, ?Slim?s Last Ride? . A year later after a father abandons his wife and child, a small rabbit arrives on the child?s doorstep. Through the course of the story, the mother watches in horror as her son projects his rage onto his pet. In ?Gallus Gallus? , an arrogant husband takes out his anger at his wife on her prized rooster. Animals serve to painfully mitigate characters who feel they have no other outlet for their longing or frustrations. Although Tinti doesn?t shy away from the gruesome, the brutality in her stories is never gratuitous, and is an accurate mirror for one?s psychology and pathological obsessions.  <br /> <br />Overall, the tales in Animal Crackers are fascinating and exceptionally wrought but simply narrated. In Tinti?s stories one will never fumble on convoluted language and heavy-handed magical realism with animals serving as ?tropes?, but the reader will be won over by the author?s compassion for her characters and the fantastic animals that inhabit their lives.  <br /> <br />	2004-07-20

Reviewed by Bonnie MacAllister of Small Spiral Notebook<br />Red Dress Ink has offered a surprisingly witty and literary work in Hubbard's take on the life of a struggling writer forced to move back home and to take on clients as a professional housecleaner. Protagonist Lisa Marie supplements her household toil by writing an anonymous advice column for the New Sparta Other. Both manual tasks reveal a paper trail which leads to discovering unsigned semi-pornographic letters, political corruption, gender-bending expeditions to Florida, and cross-dressing novelists who enact English royalty. <br />The novel is sprinkled with literary references to the classics and books of etiquette: she samples from Samuel Beckett and Marjoris Hillis' 1930s feminist treatises, citing \\"The woman always pays in a thousand little shabbinesses.\\" Hubbard's prose has a resilient quality, lucidly depicting a vivid heroine who is a bit Nancy Drew and a bit Margery Kempe. <br />Not unlike the other fare from Red Dress Ink, Lisa Marie's Guide for the Perplexed contains elements the romance of the chick lit pervading our booksellers; however, in her attention to detail, Hubbard weaves a modern love story pickled in sarcasm, marinated in disillusion, and expelled from a vacuum of dissolution. <br />Her story culminates in an Atlantis-like scene, a denouement of destruction in Anytown, Middle America: \\"The carousel that was one of the mall's icons that had been bisected by two metal poles which formerly supported a banner Shop Till You Drop. Two carousel ponies had been thrown through the window of the nearby By Gum It's Monday restaurant, and the air was thick with the odor of burned French fries and frankfurters.\\" Hubbard's work fuses the mundane of daily life with the sinister secrets which lurk beneath the bound guise of business attire.	2004-07-09

Mangarella for Small Spiral Notebook<br />When author Michelle Baldwin found her way into Denver's Mercury Café to see her first burlesque show, a career was not only born but the first lines of this delightful study of burlesque took shape. The is not just a book, it's the best type of book, a time machine back to the last century when English actress Lydia Thompson toured the U.S.A., shocking, tantalizing and conquering the American stage. <br />Baldwin's meticulous research, her obvious affection for burlesque, both legendary and contemporary, compels every page of this book to dance before the reader's eyes with a history of women who were not only ahead of their time but stole the heart of America at every whistle-stop. From the crowds that mobbed the Chicago World's Fair ogling the notorious Little Egypt through the advent of Mae West as she descends on Broadway with her first show, provocatively entitled \\"SEX\\". This book packs a lot of fast facts that peel away with the ease of silk clothing dropping to the stage floor. <br />She presents the burlesque of comedy and song, of variety acts and supple curves. From the hootchy kootchy dancers of the 1890's through Sam Scribner's Columbia Wheel, the sexually censored main circuit of burlesque houses that competed with the wild ride of the Minsky Brothers who founded stock burlesque troops and rented inexpensive theaters in poor neighborhoods that boasted cheap tickets and expensive sizzle. Eventually, Minsky's rise caused the powerful but restrictive Scribner to stop censoring his shows by allowing nudity and blue humor. <br />Ms. Baldwin's anecdotal choices are fascinating. Who invented the modern striptease? Was it Mae Dix in 1917 who accidentally removed her collars and cuffs to ignite the audience into pure wildness? Or was it Hinda Wassau who was pushed onto the stage half dressed by a stage manager? Or was it... read it for yourself-where the clothing falls is tantalizing. You can almost hear the brassy music rising from the orchestra pit as mentions of Gypsy Rose Lee, Sally Rand, Ann Corio and Georgia Sothern form their own girl shows and take them on the road. Even though they danced in Middle America, in small theaters and carnivals, they filled every seat and brought cosmopolitan glamour to venues that were way, way, way, way off Broadway. The author covers burlesque's high popularity as well as its low periods when threatened by repressive times as well as a new breed of strippers that are somewhat hardcore. Even though burlesque overcame censorship its toughest battle was with an era that was much more permissive. This is where Ms. Baldwin's book separates as provocatively as Sally Rand's fans. A major portion of \\"Burlesque\\" is devoted to \\"The New Bump-N-Grind\\" and all those suggestively creative performers that have successfully picked up the mantle of Gypsy Rose Lee, Ann Corio and other legends to show us what IS burlesque today. <br />Ms. Baldwin relates the resurgence of burlesque with even more passion because she's living it, thus endowing the second part of the book with a \\"You Are There\\" style that really does allow the reader to tour with all the contemporary performers. Jennie Lee, known as \\"The Bazoom Girl\\" in her heyday began assembling her massive collection of burlesque memorabilia on a goat farm in the California desert. Following Miss Lee's death, Dixie Evans, a fellow dancer who is a stunning Marilyn Monroe look-alike, began transforming the memorabilia into a museum. Dixie Evans also started the Miss Exotic World Competition which has drawn larger crowds each successive year. She also wrote the forward to this book. <br />\\"Burlesque And The New Bump-N-Grind\\" stems from the past and blossoms in the present and future. Ms. Baldwin's chore at describing the world of burlesque as it is today encompasses hundreds of entertainers and dozens of festivals and shows. Make no mistake about it, as this amply photographed book demonstrates, today's burlesque is every bit as sexy, funny, risque, respectable, wicked and addictive as the movements of Gypsy Rose Lee or Ann Corio or any of the great acts from decades gone by. The sumptuous photographs indicate that these new women of burlesque have taken some of their inspiration from the past. There are exquisite costumes reminiscent of the Ziegfield Follies, something to remind us of Weimar Berlin and Marlene Dietrich's The Blue Angel. There are costumes from the Silent Era and later Hollywood as well as some from the Old West. Ms. Baldwin covers all the ground, touching off on some of the men performing baggy pants comedy as well the bands that put some blood pressure into the music as the women bump-n-grind. <br />In quoting a paragraph from the book about contemporary burlesque's allure: \\"Modern glamour is the sleek, sexy aesthetic of technology. Everything from the ultrathin models featured on magazine covers to the tiniest cell phone to the most unobtrusive stereo speaker sets the pace of modern life. Burlesque glamour, on the other hand, is larger than life, filled with innuendo, and coated with glitter. Burlesque offers something different than the standard mass-produced culture. In burlesque, girls can have curves, often big curves. They can be loud and funny and still be sex symbols. The basic elements of burlesque are things that are missing from contemporary life.\\" <br />\\"Burlesque And The New Bump-N-Grind\\" teases and pleases. On a historic level, Michelle Baldwin's book should be a welcome addition to any writer's research library because of the many different areas of burlesque she covers. As for just pure fun, a bit of skin that reveals a heart much more naked, \\"Burlesque And The New Bump-N-Grind\\" is a very pleasurable read. Buy the book, and then check out the listing of websites advertising shows all across the country. Then buy yourself a ticket and go have some fun.	2004-07-02

In the spirit (or spirits if one could be so bold) of Fitzgerald comes Jonathan Ames?s latest offering, Wake Up, Sir! Faced with the terrifying prospect of following-up a highly successful first novel, Alan Blair, a thirty something neurotic, charming alcoholic is determined to the leave the docile streets of Montclair, New Jersey in order to take a cure in Sharon Springs (to commune with Jews at a Hasidic resort ? to make some sense of the Jewish Question) and complete his novel. Blair?s current situation is desperate: he deploys secret agent style tactics to artfully dodge his gun-toting NRA card-holder Uncle Irwin and a weeping Aunt only wishes Alan sobriety. <br />From a rather handsome settlement, Blair employs an affable Brit-sounding valet, Jeeves ? a homage to P.G. Wodehouse's novels. Always there when Blair winds up in a pinch (After a night of excessive drinking, Alan wonders what becomes of people that actually call those numbers scribbled on public bathrooms and the back of public phone books ? thus answering, in part, the Homosexuality Question), Jonathan Ames creates a loveable manservant that doles sincere advice (Blair must get back on the wagon and complete the novel) and ensures the selection of the smartest sport jacket and tie. After a swift and painful pummeling in Sharon Springs, they take off to the prestigious Rose Colony ? a refuge for artists to work. Spending his nights drinking, days peeling one eyelid up and attempting a few lines of prose (dictated to the waiting valet) ? Alan Blair finds himself contracting lice, labeled an Anti-Semite and falling in love with Ava, a woman who the most delicious nose. The nose promises to lead Alan on a downward spiral if it were only for the sake of trusty Jeeves?.one hopes. <br />Forever acerbic, Jonathan Ames has created a cast of unusual and hysterical characters and a minefield (or sandbox) in which to play. Regal yet raunchy, the self-absorbed, self-deprecating, Alan Blair seeks answers to all the great questions, while Jeeves seeks to keep the two afloat. Wake Up, Sir! is engaging to the end. The prose is stylishly dapper as if one were reading a Fitzgerald classic that ballooned with Ames?s fresh air. Already the author of four novels and a fixture in the New York literary scene, Wake Up, Sir! may be Jonathan Ames?s most achieved book to date.	2004-06-28

At the center is poetry teacher, Rachel Spark, who has been coping with her chipper mother, Elizabeth's bought with terminal breast cancer. For over six years, Rachel has remained in her mother's home, ferreting Elizabeth to chemo sessions, cosmetic surgery and leech therapy all amidst Rachel's own unraveling. A bevy of men haunt her bedrooms with their accents, their stories and finally, after an unprotected one-night stand with a Brit and a mother who creeps quickly towards death, Rachel finally confronts loss and the possibility of life after her mother. <br />During the day, Emma Bloom lectures girls about safer sex, sees girls with round bellies, STD cancers that fester and spread, infecting a girl's body and stands side-by-side with the woman she found kissing her husband (a man who studies bats) and wonders about love, what does it imply, who does it implicate and how it is possible that one can love and be comforted too soon. Most compelling is Georgia. A teenager alone with a brother who longs for escape from their cold home, a despondent father, and a mother who has taken up house with another - Georgia's body is this thing - this empty thing that gives her power. <br />Bodies are merely an assortment of parts that can be manipulated and molded to get one through one's day. A breast implant provides posture, balance - a mouth is an oracle to quiet with cruel words or silence through oral sex, - Lisa Glatt's debut is all at once an uncomfortable and unflinching look about women's complicated relationship with their bodies. Many of the characters bear the weight of abandonment by their loved ones and often are left to raise themselves. Disease with respect to relationships and the body is so intricately linked which raises an eye to the close relationship between sex, death and love. <br />Glatt's dialogue is authentic, prose sparkles and many of the passages are absolutely heartbreaking. The structure is a bit rough at times with the reader having to flip back and forth to locate oneself in time (same with long passages that switch between present/past tense), however, that aside, A Girl Becomes a Comma Like That is honest, pensive and uncompromising.	2004-06-28

Reviewed by Steve Hansen for Small Spiral Notebook<br />Squip is the hook; the dynamo that powers Be More Chill. It's what separates Ned Vizzini's tale of dork-cum-cool guy from your other, similar, young adult fare. <br />Jeremy Heere compounds his dorkdom by documenting each slight onto forms he's coined 'Humiliation Sheets,' ticking off every snicker, snotty comment and a number of other embarrassments he suffers daily at the hands of his peers. No explanation is given for the purpose of these sheets other than to serve as some kind of proof of their originator's dillweed-ness. They seem to be an adolescent substitute, of sorts, for self-flagellation. Heere is a loser, indeed. <br />Enter the aforementioned 'squip' (a nanocomputer perched in the brain of anyone who takes the 'magic' pill), and Jeremy goes from social pariah to student body messiah. He ascends the social strata all the way to the pinnacle of cool, thanks to his execution of the instructions given him by the voice inside his head. His squip directs him to drop his dearest, best friend Michael for political expediency's sake (how can he remain friends with somebody now below his modicum of cool?), and advises Michael to hook up with the popular chicks in order to send Christine, the girl he really likes, into a jealous tizzy. Is this computer thing Machiavellian or what? The question is can Jeremy live with himself now that he's gone from likable geek to scheming ass? <br />This novel will appeal most to those still in high school or a few years removed, thus its 'Young Adult' designation. Not to say Vizzini's writing doesn't have some universal appeal, it's just that high school 'problems' are so petty, insubstantial and contrived to anybody who's had to survive for a sustained amount of time in the real world. The tragedies of acne or someone's refusal to return a greeting in the hall seems pretty small when weighed against a home foreclosure are the scourge of a bad credit rating. <br />That saidthe squip gimmick has landed Vizzini's book a movie deal. And as you read Be More Chill, you may find yourself wondering if this wasn't the author's (perhaps unconscious) intention all along. What Hollywood executive could turn down American Pie with a Keanu Reeve's voiceover? Whether on the page or the silver screen, Be More Chill will entertain high school kids nationwide, and, no doubt, a few of their parents.	2004-06-22

Written by Katherine Darnell, of small spiral notebook<br />Happy Baby by Stephen Elliott is a piercing novel, unflinchingly narrated by a young man named Theo, a former Ward of the Court in the state of Illinois. Theo's life is one of continual movement and instability. He travels from bad group homes to abusive detention centers to dangerous schools; everywhere he goes, slipping through another crack, forsaken by another figure of authority. Guards both abuse and protect Theo, and caseworkers ask, \\"So how are they treating you?\\" without really caring to hear the answer. Despite an astoundingly complicated superstructure of State bureaucracy, Theo is resoundingly alone in the world. Elliott creates an overwhelmingly bleak world, but with his brilliant, achingly sparse brushstrokes, he is able to portray this world without resorting to over-effect. Theo and his compatriots' emotions and surroundings are written evocatively, without any sense of having been overwritten or belabored.<br />The strength of Elliott's language coupled with his clear affection for Theo makes the story soar. Elliott's tale is Dickensian in its themes of wayward childhood horror, abandonment, and artful darkness. Elliott has constructed a narrative that travels from the present into the past; each chapter (which is somewhat akin to a self-contained story) slips gently into the period of time just before that of the previous one. Elliott's genius lies in his ability to convey enough information in the preceding chapters so that the story flows gracefully, with everything coming together neatly. It would be very easy for Elliott to rely on the cleverness of the technique rather than forcing the story to stand on its own merits. But fortunately Elliott is a writer with enough talent that he completely avoids this type of literary laxity, and he creates something altogether original and incredibly powerful with the reverse-narrative technique. The effect of moving backwards in time makes the novel all the more resonant; as the reader travels into Theo's formative years, we know all too clearly the emotional havoc that was wreaked in their wake.<br />Theo's youth inside the bureaucracy of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services is a disaster. The facilities are grim, the employees are either negligent or sadistic, and the rare caring adult never lasts very long. His parents are both dead, which leaves him no other option. Theo finds love with a girl named Maria who arrives on the scene wearing innocent pink, initially possessing a charming, furtive naivety. Yet soon Theo realizes that Maria is overwhelmingly haunted by past abuses, and she craves a measure of pain and mistreatment that Theo refuses to deliver. After Maria sinks into the dark recesses of Chicago with a brutal man named Joe, Theo marries a woman named Zahava who cheats on him. Theo is aware of her infidelities, yet because of his neediness and familiarity with mistreatment, he does little to confront this situation. He lives in Amsterdam for a while, working as a barker for a sex show. Theo remains above all of the cities in which he lives, never tethered closely to any one place, never sure where he might stay, always meekly hungering for abuse, always courting some small measure of disaster and punishment. After moving to San Francisco, a woman named Ambellina becomes his companion, and Theo finds her rigorous, titillating punishments a cleansing relief. He answers her ad: \\"East Bay Woman looking for a toy to abuse. Must be full time. No equivocating.\\" She slaps him, pulls his hair, and scratches him, while simultaneously promising protection and screaming abuse. It is inside this whirlwind that Theo feels safe. The first chapter of the book depicts Theo's returning to Chicago, visiting with Maria, who appears to have found serenity and peace with the birth of her charming baby boy.<br />Elliott has created a work of great art. After reading the final chapter, which managesto read as both completely heartbreaking, and also as a comfortingly uplifting coda, it is clear that Stephen Elliott is a writer of incomparable talent. The effect of reading this book is akin to having the wind knocked out of you - painful, shocking, and thrilling at the same time.	2004-06-07

It's a Manhattan tale of an age that slipped through our fingers. A Times Square that only exists in the memory of old Broadway troopers, colored in with characters straight from the files of a dozen or so New York newspapers that have met their own expiration dates. But this book, the story of how Richard Samuels, a New Jersey teenager manages to brass his way into Orson Welles' avant garde 1937 production of Julius Caesar and then survive for seven full days is every bit the Broadway tale. Come along and listen to Kaplow's lullaby of Broadway as seen through Richie Samuels's eyes. This is the Broadway that Damon Runyon wrote about in \\"Guys and Dolls\\". And while Richie is working his bit part with the great Orson Welles, you can be sure that not far away, Sammy Glick from Budd Shulberg's What Makes Sammy Run? is conning his way from copyboy to Hollywood. It might seem a bit unorthodox to mention Runyon or Shulberg's classics but author Robert Kaplow has recreated the Manhattan they described so superbly and then dropped Richie Samuels right into it. This author is masters of subtext because you know what the major characters like Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton and John Houseman will go on to do in later years. We, the readers, know the secret and we relish in it every bit as much as Walter Winchell might bark, \\"Wynta gimmee a few words?\\" This is young Richie Samuels, who knows everything there is to know about the theatre, names of all the greats and the shows in which they appeared as well as the songs they sang. This is young Richie Samuels slickly conning his way out of high school classes to be at rehearsals where Welles thunders across the stage, raging at John Houseman who is slowly losing his mind to keep the star happy and productive. And as much as Richie Samuels believes he can learn from Orson Welles, we can forsee the future that he can't possibly know. We can see Welles frightening the country with his 1938 radio broadcast of \\"War of the Worlds\\" while further down the career path, \\"Citizen Kane\\" is just dying to be lifted from the dark heart of William Randolph Hearst. We can almost imagine Richie, many years later, turning on his television set to find a much heavier Welles in his famed wine commercials.<br />With all that said, this is Richie Samuels's week. The seven days in his life where he coldly makes the decisions that place him onto a career path. That's one reason this is not a coming of age story. Richie knows exactly what he is going to do. He never blunders into it. He is determined to stay on the stage with Welles and if that means lying to his parents, getting other kids at school to lie for him so he can cut classes and generally just obscure his Manhattan melodrama until he's ready to spring it on friends and family, he's very up to the challenge. Naturally, Richie's momentum stumbles a bit when falls in love with Sonja, an enigmatic beauty that every man in the cast wants to bed. Just the scent of her walking by Richie and Joseph Cotton launches the two men into a sex talk that sounds more like father and son than a laundry list of conquests. He learns the softness of love from Sonja while absorbing the power of an actor coming into bloom from Welles. The chemistry of these two merging within Richie, during the seven days he worked at the Mercury Theatre on West Forty-first Street, bring him the strength to face Welles when he realizes that the star can be unduly cruel to the people around him. <br />Robert Kaplow's, Me and Orson Welles is a story that we'd fully expect to see on the screen. It's the powerful type of story that HBO does so well. And, it's a lot of fun! Pick up a copy and turn some pages.	2004-05-25

Kaminsky has never returned to the \\"city of his childhood\\" because the country he left exists only in his imagination. Still, he has documented that life and its memories in his first full-length book, \\"Dancing In Odessa.\\" <br />Winner of the 2002 Dorset Prize from Tupelo Press, \\"Dancing In Odessa\\" is a joyous achievement. Passionate. Compassionate. Daring in its use of imaginative language.

In the section \\"Praise,\\" he speaks of his family's leaving Odessa. <br />This is how we live on earth, Kaminsky writes. \\"A flock of sparrows./the darkness, a magician, finds quarters/behind our ears.

Reviewed by Small Spiral Notebook<br />The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud is a truly luminous work. The novel revolves around the different realms of life, what's beyond here in the present as we know it, and what might exist on the spirit level that only a few can touch. <br />Charlie and Sam St. Cloud share a mother, a beagle named Oscar and a love for the Red Sox. One day Charlie acquires tickets for a game-the Sox against the Yankees. They sneak off by way of a neighbor's \\"borrowed\\" car, enjoy the game and then rush to make it home before their mother gets off work. Attention diverted momentarily, Charlie can't respond fast enough to avoid the truck coming at them. <br />Both boys are dead, but a determined fireman brings Charlie back to life. Sam does not share the same fate, but in that moment when neither was quite alive or death, the brothers promised to remain with one another. <br />It is a promise the two of them keep for thirteen years. <br />The townspeople and his mother believe that his grief are driving Charlie crazy, but he knows he can see and talk and hug his brother. Medicine, therapists. Finally Charlie decides that it's best not to mention Sam's presence to anyone. <br />For thirteen years, the brothers have met and played catch. Talked. In order for them to keep their promise, each has had to give up something. Sam remains a child and Charlie has never known love. <br />Not until Tess. <br />Now Charlie has to decide if he can-and how to-move on. <br />The book's structure and writing effortlessly takes one across time and plane. Dotted with humor (\\"Tess couldn't stop the reflex. 'Do you always pick up women in the cemetery?'/`Only if they're breathing.'\\"), this book will break your heart and then lift it. It is a story about the wondrous possibilities of love; its power across realms and it's a story about life and the miraculous joy of it all.	2004-05-11

Review: From Small Spiral Notebook<br />In Candyfreak, Almond parlays his own obsession with chocolate into a quest to seek out the sources and practices of today's chocolate confection, as well as to learn about the forces that have overwhelmed the artistry and pluck of individual chocalatiers into the mechanized behemoth of American mass culture. Throughout, Almond tempers his political urgencies with his own disarming awe and glee at the industry and its products, and he also deals with unfolding family tragedies. His grandfather is dying, while at the same time Almond realizes his lifelong zeal for chocolate both saved his life and \\"broke his spirit.\\" If it sounds like too much to cram in, perhaps you've not read Almond's ambitious book of sort stories, My Life in Heavy Metal, a book that will give you faith in Almond's ability to multi-task, regardless of genre.<br />Almond's prose packs a sensory wallop at all times. It is also candid, direct, and muscular- he wastes no space. Because of his economy, his writing is akin to the best candy: all good stuff, no fill or the useless air that puffs up the wretched Three Musketeers bar. When he rattles off the names of regional candybars now gone to mass marketers, he says their names are \\"incantatory poetry.\\" When he says he doesn't like coconut, he says it's like \\"chewing on a sweetened cuticle.\\" The writing says it: candy, chocolate in particular, for Almond is a passion, a \\"freak.\\" And like all freaks, Almond has his rage, and the loss of a particular candybar, the Caravelle, and his subsequent despondency and rampage after any sign of it led him to consider the book.<br />Almond meditates on the sources of his \\"freak,\\" including its lineage. His father's passion for Junior Mints he sees as a thing to awe: \\"I loved watching him eat these, patiently, with moist clicks of the tongue. I loved his mouth, the full, pillowy lips, the rakishly crooked teeth-the mouth of a closet sensualist.\\" After some consideration of the roots, however, he's off, interviewing confectioners, visiting factories and tasting candy fresh out of the \\"enrober\\" (a device to which he devotes many fine lines), squirreling away samples, and trying to see what did happen to chocolate in America. The short answer is, well, the same thing that happened virtually to every worthwhile thing from beer to sports: mass distribution, mass advertising, mass culture, mass dumbing down.<br />The short answer doesn't do justice to Almond's work because Candyfreak does what the best creative nonfiction does: reports something in unerring detail, educates about a topic we thought we knew a thing or two about, tells a story both about the author and about the subject, and delivers the whole package in style. Almond's fevered style-known to many from his short stories-here finds a subject about which many folks feel feverish, and the result is one of the most entertaining books I've read in a while.<br />Almond's tries to balance political fantasy and the reality of the urge: \\"In my own pathologically romantic sense of things, I viewed [little] companies as throwbacks to a bygone era of candy, when each town had its individual brands. And the good peoples of this country would gather together, in public squares with lots of trees and perhaps a fellow picking a banjo, and they would partake of the particular candy bar produced in their town and feel a surge of sucrose-fueled civic identity. What I really wanted to do was visit these companies-if nay still existed-and to chronicle their struggles for survival in this wicked age of homogeneity, and, not incidentally, to load up on free candy.\\"<br />While he showcases opinions and can seem hostile at times in his discernment, he is not faddish or uncritical: \\"The new chocolate specialty products are equally pretentious. I ask you, does the world truly need a bar infused with hot masala? The latest rage, as of this writing, is super-concentrated chocolate, with a cocoa content inthe 90 percent range, a trend that will, in due time, allow us to eat Baker's Chocolate at ten bucks a square.\\"<br />Opinionated, deftly and surprisingly written, thoroughly experienced, and surprisingly moving, Steve Almond's Candyfreak will have you wandering into specialty stores hoping they have candy racks. It will have you looking down your nose at M&amp;Ms, for perhaps the first time in your life. It will have you cruising the Internet for the Five Star Bar, hoping the taste lives up to the writing. It will have you thinking about chocolate for weeks afterward, more than you ever have.

The older we get, the more we realize how untrue-and unfair-that perception is. How I Learned to Cook is a gripping look at the truth about mothers and daughters, and the matchless strength of the bonds we share. That is not to say it is a book full of heartwarming mother-daughter tales. The authors of these stories have reached deep into the vaults of their childhood memories, often exposing pain but always revealing the powerful affect of their mothers in their lives. As adults, they are able to look back and see their mothers as the very real and often very flawed women that they were and are. In some cases the scars of childhood are strong, and one can sense that the writer is still seeking answers and explanations, but in other stories there is an echo of love strengthened through time and understanding. None of these mothers is one-dimensionally caring or cruel, and this lovely and heartbreaking anthology is full of the explorations of this most complex of relationships.<br />Perin points out in the Introduction that fear of betraying or demeaning the image of the mother or one's own mother has kept many women from telling the truth of the pain inflicted on them in childhood by women who were supposed to protect them from all things. How I Learned to Cook brings some such examples painfully to life. There is Ruth Kluger's mother who, upon arriving in Auschwitz-Birkenau, calmly suggests to Ruth that they go together and throw themselves against the electric fencing. Or Hillary Gamerow's, who tells her young daughter simply one night that she has put rat poison in the family's dinner, and that they will all die in their sleep. When that turns out not to be true, she says, \\"Well, you never know. I could do it anytime, right?\\" Then there is the mother in \\"The Body Geographic,\\" who watches with a gleam of satisfaction as her husband beats her daughter senseless. One cannot help but admire the bravery it must have taken for these women to tell their stories. They are kick-in-the-gut painful, to the point where it is often hard to believe they are real, but they are also gripping and written with lyricism touched with a grief that seeps through the pages.<br />There are other stories here too; stories where societal expectations and other outside forces shape the nature of the relationship between mother and daughter. Nawal el Saadawi tells of being raised in Egypt, her mother's love separated from her by a veil that is both literal and figurative. In \\"Home is Where Your Stuff Is\\" Helen Ruggieri describes her mother's obsession with cleaning and maintaining the \\"stuff\\" in her house-her attention to the domestic space she can control seemingly overtaking her ability to focus on the people living within it. In \\"Anybody Could See It\\" Elizabeth Payne reflects on her father's infidelity to her mother and the way both women struggled to recover from that betrayal. \\"Domestic Silence\\" tells the story of Meena's attempts to rescue her unwilling mother from her abusive marriage, leaving her feeling that she has been the caretaker all along, rather than the other way around.<br />The beauty of these stories is the authors' willingness to be honest, whether they are sharing the depth of love and respect they feel for the multi-faceted women that brought them into the world, or their deep-seated pain and anger at the betrayal of what we often view as the most natural of bonds. In most cases the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes, where real relationships exist in all their intricacies.<br />* Odds are this book will make you appreciate your own mother (I felt compelled to call mine and thank her for being wonderful), but I should point out it's not exactly the ideal Mother's Day gift...stick with flowers and keep this one for yourself.	2004-04-22

The voices in these poems are heady with the strength of their newfound feelings, stark in their fear and pain, and beautiful in their depiction of first loves.  There are experiences of shame and hurt in these stories, yes, but there is also hope.  In \\"Playing for Love,\\" Amanda R. Evans turns the language of tennis into a reflection on both the emptiness and the always electrifying chance of love:  \\"`love-love' / And still when I say it, the hollowness of that sound / comes back:  love as zero, full of possibility, waiting to be filled.\\"<br /><br />No matter what your sexuality, there is no doubt you will hear the echoes of your own adolescence among these pages-who isn't confused about sex and desire as a teenager?  For that matter, who has it all figured out as an adult?  For many young people these poems will no doubt be a great comfort, a lifeline out of loneliness and isolation.  So much of our young lives are spent struggling with the notion of what it means to be \\"normal.\\"  We want to fit in, but we want to be unique; we want to be \\"normal\\" but we know we are greater than that simple label.  This book reminds us all of the important fact that there is no such thing-we are each of us great, complex, unique beings, and that is something to celebrate.  To that end the collection captures a varied and vivid cacophony of queer voices and stories, defying stereotypes and honoring the terror and wonder of emerging sexuality.  More than one poem makes reference to the butterfly as an appropriate symbol for this period of transformation from something unsure and unassuming into something fragile but miraculous.  It is not an inappropriate symbol for this book, either-a slim volume that is full of unexpected power and beauty.  It is a voice for the too-often voiceless, and we can only hope it inspires a new generation of gay and lesbian poets to, as Gerard Wozek puts it, \\"dream their voices into the world, / a little wounded, but on fire.\\"it inspires a new generation of gay and lesbian poets to, as Gerard Wozek puts it, \\"dream their voices into the world, / a little wounded, but on fire.\\"	2004-04-19

After concluding Alice Munro's story collection, Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage and I have to say, I was blown away. Sometimes Munro's style perturbs me, notably in the recent New Yorker story where it took too long for the story to unravel and the payoff at the end may not have been worth the struggle to get there. Anyway, there was a touch of that in some of the stories in Hateship. The overall theme (well, for me at least) revolved around women who cannot control their fate and some of the stories truly sung for me while others such as &quot;What is Remembered&quot; and &quot;Floating Bridge&quot;. True standouts were: &quot;Queenie&quot; with subtly Munro unravels a sister's misconception of her elder sister's marriage, &quot;Comfort&quot;, the title story (although it is well over 50 pages, it is worth the investment for its rich, complex twist and the heartbreaking final story, &quot;The Bear Came Over the Mountain&quot; was so arresting and masterful, I felt incredibly moved and intimidated all at once. Here is a writer that has refined her craft, razor sharp, precise. A marriage between a seemingly affluent and cosmopolitan couple disintegrates with Fiona's (the wife) onslaught of mental illness which takes her to a mental institution where she finally manages to have the last word with her adulterous husband. Survival in Munro's stories are always coupled with sorrow...survival is bittersweet.	2004-04-01

In a brilliant post-humous work, Anthony Piccione's The Guests At The Gate demonstrates a writer straddling his human existence with the approaching afterlife. The poems hauntingly predict Piccione's death and his comfort in his journey into the other world.<BR>The first series of poems from &quot;Dear Friend&quot; demonstrate Piccione's admiration for the world he will soon leave. In Town Meeting:<br />And it is here, <BR>in a handful of unrelenting survivors, without guile, <BR>or scheme, or the desire to live forever. <br />In &quot;Meeting as Well Dear Friend&quot;, the author continues to exhibit compassion for the &quot;oddities&quot; of life and the people that inhabit. His tone is almost frail and frightened; he begs for more time - to gather more sense of the earth's complexity. For Piccione, there is still much to be done, much to learn. Prolific bell imagery and use of light signal death's call. He carefully weaves these striking images notably in &quot;Because I Listened&quot; and &quot;Down in Prattsburgh, New York&quot;. The doorbells are smothered in water or they are small and their sound is slight. The light is mostly blanketed. For a man desperate and clinging to life, death is prevalent, but for now, distant - in the background. <br />The poems in &quot;Gathering the News&quot; reflect the author's efforts to forage and record human experience. Here, Piccione is an active collector of slice of life vignettes becomes more acutely aware of the grand presence of God. Piccione is also mindful of time - its seamless nature as well as its limits. <br />In the luminous &quot;Local Writer&quot;, the author is faced with an order double of himself as wise and reflective. The older man remarks, &quot;Anything leaves traces leaves a story,&quot; and &quot;Imagination is just a remembrance from the other side, of course&quot;. The other side indicative of the afterlife and the author is confident that all the memories that he stores will accompany him in thisjourney.<br />The careful observance of time is effectively done in &quot;Sitting in the Mall While My Wife Does All The Work&quot; as Piccione muses over our ability to lounge, to toil - in effect to be great wasters of time. The flickering light imagery returns as a call to the gates, <br />...and now these walls are folding <BR>Nothing holds forever. We sense the news. <BR>So many twisting guests to be kissed at the gate, and lead inside. <br />Piccione feels his call nearing. The poems in &quot;What Calls Out For Us&quot; are Piccione's summations of the &quot;other&quot; that lingers, taunts and waits for his arrival at the gate. In &quot;Reading All Night at The Table&quot; the other dons the images of flying dogs, winged creatures - very distinct death symbolism. These creatures &quot;seem always at home in their play, circling, waiting, hurrying me to catch up, to move on.&quot; Time is again limited for the author as he is encouraged to not toil but to prepare for his death. However, time appears limitless in the afterlife as these creatures play and lounge. The other is an omnipotent guardian in &quot;At Breakfast&quot; protecting sweet children from injury and pain. <br />These powerful and mystical images are also found in &quot;Just as Something Calls&quot; in the form of a Yankton healer who journeys to relieve Piccione's sister of cancer. <br />The poems in &quot;In Cool Twilight&quot; offer a distinct shift in tone. A once frightened Piccione now calmly welcomes the other side; he savors life and its beauty, however, these set of poems are of fatalistic acceptance of one's inevitable mortality. He notes with fervor in &quot;Out Into Twilight , Early December&quot; how lucky one is to be alive. Piccione continues his perceptions of life's joy in &quot;Night Train Through Inner Mongolia&quot;. However, death hovers near. The &quot;chittering&quot; creatures return in &quot;Lying Down Under a Tree At Dusk&quot;, however Piccione's reaction differs fromhis early poems. He does not turn the page and flick them away like gnats - instead he allows them to remain in their calm silence. The playful nature of these creatures disappears and the poem takes a more solemn tone. The author gives us indication that the afterlife is ready for his arrival. The section closes fantastically with deep introspective emotion. Again, Piccione cries out for more time, &quot;I want to come in, start over...&quot; with urgency knowing that the cycle of life will soon close for him. <br />The closing set of poems in &quot;Looking Up Quickly&quot; neatly brings the collection full circle. In the carefully crafted &quot;It's Morning&quot; the reader feels we are at the last leg of the journey with Piccione. He leans out of his window as if to inhale the last breaths of life and sits in retrospect and deep love of life and God. <br />How easily we take life to ourselves, what we wished for, even the <BR>trouble, love, children, calling, all of it pulling us to our knees in <BR>feverish good play. It is a great gift, that kneeling, not matter what <BR>we've done. <BR>His comfort with the other side swells in &quot;Lounging Awhile And Keeping Still&quot;. Piccione embraces silence, the quiet. He tiptoes and then wildly flees himself across &quot;the edge of ourselves&quot; or our mortal body. Piccione continues in &quot;At My Mother's Grave&quot; with the image of one's body as a doorway to something other. As the poem closes and Piccione lies on the earth near his mother, the reader experiences a finale - Piccione embracing life while also succumbing to death. <br />The evocative and astounding imagery woven into the collection in The Guests at The Gate wholly addresses the themes of life, death, joy, and time. Piccione is always vulnerable in his poetry that richly resonates for the reader.	2004-03-26

A dazzling debut, Snow Island follows the dual stories of Alice Daggett and George Tibbits in a small isolated island populated by quahoggers and eccentrics during the Second World War. Towler weaves the two plot lines intricately, at the same time subtly relaying the nuances of the island's inhabitants through gossip and tales. <br />Sixteen-year old Alice Daggett, haunted by the tragic death of her father six years prior and the overbearing presence of her mother Evelyn, never quite fits into the strict societal rules of the small gossiping town. Her awkwardness as she becomes aware of her own sexuality-her fear of not understanding her role as a woman and her fear of her inability to fulfill it-is beautifully told. Snow Island also unravels the unique story of George Tibbits, a recluse in his forties, who returns to the island each year in order to gain some closure regarding the death of the two women who raised him. <br />Snow Island is an evocative work with characters carefully chosen and crafted. Moving and luminous, it breaks the clichés of war novels. The characters and their stories resonate and linger long after the last page.	2004-03-26

Sullivan<BR>Freud believed that \\"unheimlich\\" or the uncanny is a much more fertile province in fiction than in real life, for it contains the whole of the latter and something more besides, something that cannot be found in real life. The contrast between what has been repressed and what has been surmounted cannot be transposed on to the uncanny in fiction without profound modification; for the realm of fantasy depends for its effect on the fact that its content is not submitted to reality-testing.  The supernatural, albeit concepts of telekinesis, black magic, migration, and demonic possession, is this elusive and intriguing goddess, because it provides one that leads a hum-drum life with the possibility of something other.<BR>Sara Gran's second effort, Come Closer, is a spare and haunting story that migrates the reader from the definitive world of which we are comfortably familiar to a very different world dominated by a lascivious demon, Naamah, known by the Kabbalah as an evil spirit that has \\"a lust for life and a taste for violence\\" that assumes the body and mind of a young architect, Amanda.  The central figure is a woman that lives a quiet life with her husband and her only thrill is the affections of a stray shepherd that lurks in her empty neighborhood.<BR>The story opens with an odd tapping that only occurs in Amanda's presence.  Unable to locate the origin of the sound, she & her husband assume it's mice in the walls, a building abnormality.  And so it goes.  Soon thereafter, she mistakenly receives a book in the mail entitled, Demon Possession Past and Present and she receives visits in her dreams by a warm figure that was a childhood imaginary friend.  They lay in sanguine sand, warmed and Amanda is filled with comfort and release.  The dreams increase with fervor and soon Naamah is a voice teetering on her earlobe, eager to envelope Amanda, to create her anew.  Slowly, things beginto change.  Amanda burns her husband, accidentally, a black-out reveals that she has committed a slashing of a newsstand seller and a colleague and she repeatedly finds herself in bars donning sexy heels and painted lips, seducing men.  Throughout the transformation, Gran effectively balances the psychological with the supernatural.  Naamah is Amanda's id, delivering the freedom that she would otherwise never have.  But a part of her intercedes, always, seeking to right things by visiting a psychiatrist, seeking a exorcism, a sliver of her ego clings while the rest of her slips away.  Gran keeps the tension heightened to determine whether Amanda's life will return to normal - she'll resume her safe life with Ed, peter along at her small firm or will Naamah sustain, consume Amanda whole.  The story's progression is artful, subtle and the balance of Amanda/Naamah's interior point-of-view juxtaposed with her outward face is masterful in understanding the character's psychological transformation.  One feels this is New York, but not really - from the nebulous location throughout, the reader feels grounded and ungrounded at the same time.  Gran in Come Closer asks us to question the things we firmly know.<BR>The psychological and supernatural are so intricately linked in this tale, that it is eerily accessible to the reader - could the impossible be possible?  What is possession?  What are the limits of the pragmatic, scientific world as we know of it and how easily could it be compromised by the intangible?  Sara Gran weaves a fine yarn between the two and delivers a wonderfully unpredictable ending in our predictable world.	2003-12-26

BRILLIANT	Slowly creeping through Delillo's world in White Noise, I felt I was caught up in the midst of an apocalypse where acerbic wit teetered on everyone's tongue and everyone was comfortably uncomfortable. So close it was to the typical Updike tale of a family enduring crisis independently and as a collective infused with Delillo's politics and vision of the technologically obsessed society. Television is the collective unconscious, and the family competes to out-wit one another. In the end, I shielded myself with my radioactive blanket and prayed for a simpler world of beanstalks and freesia instead of one where mankind was slowly committing mass suicide. <br />I had a similar feeling while reading Matthew Sharpe's The Sleeping Father, however, I will dare to say that Sharpe is more successful than Delillo's (although incredibly brilliant) work in so far as they novel delivers a quieter message about the crumbling nuclear family without the fanfare and confetti of toxic gas and gas masks. Here, divorced and depressed Bernard Schwartz, unhappily medicated on Prozac, manages to take another anti-depressant which chemically reacts to induce a coma. While he lies in a hospital bed, he is surrounded by his gifted and utterly sad children that need him to sustain. Chris Schwartz is a man that only drinks when he knows he will drive and his younger sister, Cathy, fascinated by the Jewish martyr turned saint, Edith Stein, earnestly cloaks herself with holy water, prayer and ritual in order to unfold her identity and aid in her coping with a mute father, a mother that Cathy caught in a compromising position while she was married to Bernie and a brother that both angers and comforts her. Although Sharpe is merciless in his dialogue between characters, arming them with caustic wit, he undoes them with moments that his characters themselves can only own. Alone in the hospital bed, Chris proceeds to draw a Hitler moustache on his father's sleeping face and after he's seen his work,he crumbles and huddles under his father's bed to be closer to him. After rebuffing Chris's best friend and fellow embittered partner-in-crime, Frank Dial's lyric about her moist palms, she is soon drawn closer to Frank and ultimately, they seek to create a new family outside of their withering own. Somewhat oblivious to their own privilege, Sharpe is careful about rendering his characters sympathetic, not sentimental. After donating an inheritance to a battered woman's shelter, Cathy befriends a victim who consequently robs their home so that her family, too, can start another life. <br />All the characters, albeit, Dr. Danmeyer, mother Lila Munroe, Moe Danmeyer, Frank Dial seek something other in Sharpe's brilliantly constructed novel. However, they find that the one thing that remains, that binds them together is Bernie, who after waking from his comma, finds his family completely fallen apart, his ex-wife with another man and is limited by his own capacity to speak and construct words. Again, Sharpe veers away from the over-sentimentality by infusing some of Bernie's own wit into the most honest narrative in the entire work. Cloaked by his illness, he has been given license to react truthfully and sometimes tactless - this serves to continuously challenge the surrounding characters that ironically enough, are mentally superior. Although he is compromised by his illness, he is not compromised as a fully-realized and endearing character. <br />There are some truly hysterical moments in a novel that involves a coma, a beating, a divorce, a robbery, pistol-whipping, however they are uplifted by the individual characters unraveling themselves and redefining family in their own particular way. The laughter comes from a real place - one of fear, of love. <br />The only criticism that I can offer is ironically what I loved most about the tale Sharpe weaves. All of the characters are too finely tuned, everyone knows exactly what to say at any given moment and they are all armed with their own brand of barbs and witticisms. It may have fared more successful (than the novel already is) if a character other than Bernie was somehow calmer, less ready to react for at times, the characters' dialogue echoed too close to one another. A small note on an otherwise searing portrait.	2003-12-03

She doesn't cover her narrator's co-dependency, depression, anger, rage (all the fantastic range of emotions) with cheapened exposition, precious images and sing-song prose. Rather, her prose is sharp, short and powerful and the dialogue or sometimes the lack thereof between the unnamed narrator and the &quot;Alcoholic&quot; really tells it all. Engaging, I sometimes winced over several scenes (the heroin needle in the stomach, the attempted rape scene in another story), however, this is the true gift of the writer...the ability to shake me and propel me forward, wanting me to read more.  Far from a precious book, this novel sustains, engages and sucks the reader in.  Brava! And I cannot wait for the next novel.<br />On a side note, why is this fantastic book paired with the horrible James Frey novel?	2003-10-31
US	49474042	RRK3AYOIZK4LK	1592640273	340273025	Beulah Land	Books	2	20	23	N	N	a promising, but even collection	Apparently, a reader is unable to receive a fair review of Ms. McGruder's book as it appears that there are a slew of those that know Ms. McGruder personally - either as a friend or as a detractor.  As I do not know Krista McGruder or have never had a book of mine reviewed by her, I will render what will hopefully be a fair review.<br />The collection, although well-written in many spots, is frankly uneven.  There are some notable standouts: \\"Clan of Marsupials\\" which renders an interesting depiction of urbanities with a killer first line - red wine getting words faster on a page...\\"Dirty Laundry\\" for its character depictions and an O'Henry-esque quality about \\"The Bereavement of Eugene Wilder\\" where the burial is cleverly depicted as a fully-realized character.  However, \\"Divination\\" and \\"A View from Eagle Rock Mountain\\" are less successful with winded narratives and some awkward turns and cliché phrases in her prose. \\"Host\\" reads entirely rushed and overwritten. The second person/distant narrator technique does not gel with the rest of the collection and feels as if it were a last minute inclusion.<br />To note that those that cannot handle dense prose should read Danielle Steele is a ridiculous and insulting comment - as if these two writers comprise spectrum ends in literary fiction and those that do not accept Ms. McGruder's prose are somehow flawed, they are reduced as readers.  There is a difference between the lyrical poetry of Faulkner and some of the heavy, dense exposition in McGruder's work as in \\"A VIEW FROM EAGLE ROCK MOUNTAIN\\" which doesn't propel the narrative forward, and at times, pulls the reader out of the story.  <br />People are too quick to tout new writers as brilliant, the best of their generation. Ms. McGruder's book is promising and exhibits her fine talent as a writer; however, it is not by any means a dazzling work of new fiction from a brilliant mind. Phrases like incredible debut, startling, astonishing are so overused in reviews thatthey've lost their luster.  Keep it simple: it's a good book from a talented writer who perhaps needs to grow a bit more as a writer.	2003-10-27
US	49474042	R14ZD6Y96J5ZS6	1931982139	572119349	Degas Must Have Loved a Dancer	Books	5	2	5	N	N	a fantastic debut from a very prolific new talent	highly recommend this gem to anyone that loves good fiction, can appreciate lyrical language reminiscent of Flaubert (fine chocolate!) and the obsession one carries for their art. It's the story of two ex-pats in Belgium, Adina and Zachary. Adina, in want of fodder for her fiction, heads to Belgium for a year to work as an au pair for a chain-smoking, disillusioned mother, a perpetually drunk father and a child that is wise beyond his years. A chance encounter with a painter, Zachary (who is lead to Belgium by a wealthy cousin who patrons him with a gallery and a premiere exhibition), in a bus in Prague sparks their obsession for one another. A white-haired Adina (her hair mysteriously falls out in the beginning of the novel and grows back white, the absence of color) and a man that can only paint when she is evoked, fall in love with one another or how each other affects their art. Soon, Adina is writing furiously, feverishly. Stories about the body and the mind and their mutual exclusivity and their intricate ties to each other. Zachary murals Adina, his only vision is her. Throughout, Krista is fierce in her philosophy and her prose is never precious, but smart and precise. Each chapter shifts point of view between the two characters and the flow is organic and satisfying. A highly recommended read with an unexpected and climatic ending.	2003-09-12
