If I'm to believe the pundits, it keeps my aircraft up in the air; so out of a feeling of self-preservation, I've tried hard to understand what's happening to my aircraft during flight and as a result and most important, understand what is safe to do during flight.<br /><br />There are many books on the subject with most of them written in dry, academic tones complete with differential calculus.  There are notable exceptions to this ('The Science of Flight' by Hubin comes to mind) but really, I've not found many books that take a conversational approach until I got 'Understanding Flight' by Anderson. Quickly but precisely, Anderson dissects aerodynamics for the non-mathematician and using examples from other fields and everyday occurrences, explains what happens when a wing is subject to an airflow.  Due to this book, I've been finally disabused of the great sucking theorem by Bernoulli that most often is used to explain lift.  The point is, Anderson explains exactly what happens and it makes sense.  Along the way, he does a reasonable job of debunking other theories of flight and why they couldn't logically explain heavier-than-air flight.<br /><br />I really like this book and do highly recommend it.	2005-04-21

I have Kershner's material, I have the Thom series (great set, by the way!), and I have the funny but instructive book by Rod Machado.<br /><br />These all have their different methods of knowledge transfer, mostly good. However, I find some topics improperly covered; a situation I can only attribute to language.  These authors know what it is they are talking about but transferring that knowledge via the written word is difficult.  One such topic, for example, is altimeter settings.  With the possible exception of Trevor Thom, most of the others didn't do as good a job as they could have.<br /><br />From the Ground Up is small (physically) by comparison to the manuals by Machado and Thom but it does such a good job of precisely and knowledgeably covering all the topics a prospective--and currently active--pilot needs to know that the reader does not notice!  How refreshing.  Reading the sections covering altimeter settings, the author(s) simply and quickly impart the essence of the topic so that I am thoroughly satisfied I completely understand.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend a better book on the subject--except again for anything by Trevor Thom.	2005-03-25

The style is approachable and the points are (almost) un-impeachable: ideology will lead you down the wrong path everytime and I daresay there's not much I can find wrong with his assertions.<br /><br />He describes ideologues as falling into several categories, with Joiners being the largest: those poor souls who heedlessly and unthinkingly swallow then regurgitate (usually in the form of bumper stickers and protest signs accompanied by the Banshee screams of the self-righteous) whatever their trend of choice is, from Abortion Rights to Hyper-environmentalism, take your pick.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-01-19

I'm a student pilot (hopefully for not much longer!) and navigation is very interesting to me, not to talk of very important as well. I've heard of celestial navigation as being the ultimate form of navigation and I was interested in finding out more about it by reading various books but each time I did, I had to give up because I did not have the necessary PhD in astrophysics to understand what the author was trying to say.<br />So, it was with a little trepidation that I approached reading this book by Schlereth and to my pleasant surprise, celestial navigation makes sense! His use of simplified theory may not be to some people's taste but at the end of the day, I'm not studying for an exam, I'm trying to understand what celestial navigation is and how to use it. This book teaches you how exactly to use it and that's all that matters to any good author and should to any good reader. I can now go outdoors with a sextant and the necessary tables and find out where on earth I am, correct theory or no!	2002-08-31

It's that important. And it's not just for women (although, as the author sadly but correctly points out, they are the recepients of the most violence). De Becker is a (now) famous author specialising in protection; he speaks very authoritatively about it and from reading this and some of his other books, I can understand why: he certainly has the pedigree and experience to do so. The tactics he proffers are simple and quick to implement. It requires nothing more fantastic than common sense (which as we all know, isn't common!). Altogether, this is a great book.

US	50563620	R3LC8LBWT3QUT5	0671535110	163194594	Strong on Defense	Books	5	6	7	N	N	An astonishing book	Sanford Strong's uniquely titled book is unique in yet another way: it communicates an entire theory of self-defense using terms, ideas, and tactics that most people would not have ordinarily used in explaining why and how they should defend themselves from attack.<br />Strong shows--correctly--that most attacks are carried out by recidivists whose one goal (apart from the obvious) is to get away with their crime as cleanly as possible after committing it. This usually involves getting rid of witnesses: yep, you! In so doing, Strong has dispelled a strong myth (usually espoused by the mainstream media and some police persons) concerning attacks and self-defense. Passivity will get you killed, he says. Another myth dispelled early on is thinking that training in a martial arts programme will usually suffice to defend oneself. He correctly points out that most martial arts programmes require many years of dedicated study. Time that most people do not have.<br />He goes on to outline the steps he recommends anyone faced with armed (or unarmed) attack should take to safeguard themselves. His system is simplicity itself and does not require intense reflection, the best sort. Illustrative stories of ordinary people who were faced with attack and some of the things they did right or wrong pepper the book and is used very effectively to show his system in action.<br />I heartily recommend this book and urge everyone to study it from cover to cover. A most important work.	2002-04-20

As a (then) relative newcomer to pistol shooting, I was immediately impressed by the simplicity of his instruction and the great intelligence it belied. I searched out anything written by him and found quite a number. This, 'The Tactical Pistol', is the first I've read and my original analysis of Suarez, much to my pleasure, holds true.<br />Most traditional \\"gun authors\\" (for want of a better description) indulge in self-aggrandizing and pompous language, immediately betraying their low estimation either of themselves and their writing ability, or worse, of the reader. Suarez does not make the mistake of falling into the trap that has caught so many (Massad Ayoob comes to mind: great content, horrible language) and simply but clearly instructs the newbie and the experienced alike in the art of using a pistol as a tool for self-defense. He includes enlightening lessons on the pistol's use in several different scenarios: home invasions, burglary, low-light situations, self-defense outside the house with a concealed firearm, etc. Very informative.<br />Suarez, it turns out, has every right to write such a book. He's an LAPD police officer with some impressive credentials. The fact that he does not beat the reader over the head with them only serves to buttress my opinion of him. I heartily recommend this excellent work.	2002-04-20

Even rarer are good authors. Dr. John Nunn has proven, time and again, that he can write Chess books better than 90% of the field. 'Understanding Chess Move by Move' is patterned after the famous book by Irving Chernev ('Logical Chess: Move by Move') but this recent work outshines the Chernev book in several ways. This is not to say that Chernev's work is useless; far from it! Chernev's book was a trail-blazer and has been held in high esteem for years, as it should be. Nunn borrows from and builds on Chernev and admits it without a moment's hesitation. Again, this is as it should be.<br />Where Nunn outshines Chernev is in the area of extensive (some would even say exhaustive) analysis. For those of us Chess players who want more than the paltry explanations of Chernev, Nunn has done us a favour. An extensive overview followed up by intensive analysis in many parts of the book helps the Chess student really understand what is happening on the board. There are many insights given by Nunn into the thought processes of modern grandmasters as they play. Who best to distil and explain these processes than a top GM? Chernev never was at the top of his Chess generation but Nunn is and that's yet another difference. Not only those Nunn do a marvellous job of explanation, his prose is easy to understand, a benefit, I suppose, of his being both English and having a PhD. in History (or so I've heard).<br />There are many top GM games reviewed and dissected in this body of work and each one is an example of modern Chess at its best. Kudos to Nunn on another masterpiece.	2002-04-19

I have owned several editions of Nemeth's 'UNIX System Administration Handbook' (USAH) and I have always been highly impressed by the quality of writing and instruction. In that book, Nemeth et al brilliantly (and humorously) packed material into 853 pages where other lesser authors (J. Winsor comes to mind) have needed several (dry) volumes. Most Unix System Administration books merely regurgitate or re-word 'man' pages and are entirely useless.<br />So, being as familiar as I am with their past performances, I did not hesitate to buy this their latest work from Amazon. Understand that there are a lot of similarities between Unix and Linux and as such, this book doesn't really differ that much from USAH. There is still the same highly informative prose, the same humorous approach to instructing via the written word. I think this is an attempt by the authors to capitalize on the popularity of the Linux Operating System and in any other author, this would be gauche. Not so with Nemeth and her team of writers. Here, they have again done an extra-ordinary job of instructing both experienced and novice sysadmins in the fine art and science of being that most noble of professions: a Unix/Linux System Administrator.<br />Good job!	2002-04-19

'A Trial by Jury' is a well-written book, of that there is no doubt. I will agree with the criticism directed against the author's overly pedantic view of things but the reader is given enough warning of this by the author himself in the first few pages. I especially thought his 'apples, blood oranges and almonds' bit was a little too bewildering for my tastes. All this however, should not stand in the way of digesting this work as it is a very credible point-of-view of the inner workings of a trial by jury (in New York, anyway). The reader will be particularly impressed by the well-reasoned and similarly well-stated conclusion about the awesome power of the state as it goes about the business of keeping it's citizens in check.

Weighing in at a \\"mere\\" 105 pages, one is tempted to think there simply can't be that much Chess knowledge to be had within, but this book is a poster child for the oft-repeated maxim of not judging a book by its cover. Crouch approaches the topic like an arrow would a target. He starts with a chapter titled 'Basics of the Kingside Attack: The Three Piece rule\\" which outlines what I think is a unique but very sensible approach to formulating and coordinating an attack on the enemy king. He surmises, correctly, that \\"...In general, a successful kingside attack will need at least three pieces participating; one to be sacrificed and two to give checkmate.\\" What a succinct and logical statement that will help a lot of novices understand what is necessary to have on deck before conducting an attack! In addition to such an erudite summary, he goes on to annotate a series of instructive games that serve to buttress his 'rule'.<br /><br />One excellent chapter follows another. Chapter two details his characterizations of the game as having two \\"personalities\\": fighting chess and technical chess. This brings to mind the usual strategy versus tactics argument. Strategical operations seem to be what the author likes to term \\"fighting chess\\" (the jockeying for a better position) and once that is achieved, launching tactical operations (his \\"technical chess\\"). Crouch does a very good job of explaining the differences and goes on to give examples with well-annotated games. The wonderous thing is the precise brevity with which he explains that which some other authors have wasted reams of paper on. He is to be commended. After these come the following chapters: Sacrifices and Combinations; Piece Mobility: Breaking the Symmetry; Piece Mobility: The Center and the Flank; The Initiative; The Attack Goes Wrong and finally, Quizzes. In all these chapters, Crouch, to show proper attacking technique, uses the games of (then and still) rising superstar Alexander Morozevich as he hacked his way through the 1994 Lloyds Bank Masters tournament, ending with a 9.5/10 score against titled players!<br /><br />The whole book is dotted with good advice on how to carry out attacks (and importantly, without prejudice to either the kingside or the queenside, a point he stresses and one that is well worth remembering). He highlights each important point with italicized text, a nice addition to an already superlative effort. In all, I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to start playing clean, surgical but imaginative chess. The kind of chess that creates tournament winners. The final \\"Quizzes\\" chapter enables the reader to show how well understood the text was (or wasn't!). A fitting companion to the attacking Bible: The Art of Attack by Vukovic.show proper attacking technique, uses the games of (then and still) rising superstar Alexander Morozevich as he hacked his way through the 1994 Lloyds Bank Masters tournament, ending with a 9.5/10 score against titled players!

I have been worshipping at the Chess altar of Chris Baker for some time (close to six months) and I have to admit that he has written a book designed, indeed, to be startling but here's the kicker: to both you and your opponent! There are many lines given (all supposedly pro-White, by the way, and based on Black's replies to 1.e4) that haven't been analysed in-depth or played much at major tournaments and the reason for this is quite simple, really: these lines are quite horrid in the hands of lower-level players and will quickly get you into trouble if you don't understand what's happening 'behind the barn' as it were.<br />Baker, an International Master, has made little effort to explain why moves are made or the general trend/idea of the game, leaving things up to the reader to do so. I would not recommend this book to players with USCF ratings of 1500 or below and even then, not without a lot of personal and computer-aided analysis of the lines. However, in the right hands, it's great to trot out these lines as White from time-to-time, if only to get Black thinking for long enough for White to get a cup of coffee!	2001-06-21

I had no idea who Ludek Pachman was but since I was in the market for a book on strategy, it seemed to fit the bill.  The explanations of such simple yet important topics as the pawns, the center, the minority attack and others are undertaken without too much confusing chess master jargon.  Pachman had a real gift for imparting Chess wisdom. Slight problem: the book is in the older but entirely readable descriptive notation and it's actually an abridgement that (from the translator's preface): 'attempts to compress into one volume the material contained in the three volumes of Moderne Schachstrategie, the German translation of the Czech original...' One can find the first two original volumes, as I did, without too much problem.  The third volume is as rare as Hen's teeth so if you find it, grab it.  Silman recommends this three-volume set very highly. I would recommend it/them only for the slightly intermediate to advanced intermediate players who are very comfortable with the basics of the game.	2001-06-12

Sure, I thought, they want to keep the secrets of their success from me, so I listened in a little harder (I promptly lost the game I was playing!) and was able to catch &quot;1953&quot; and &quot;Zurich&quot;. Amazon.com was my next stop. I typed in 1953, Zurich and Chess.  The outcome?  This extraordinary book.  I'd spied it before at various bookstores but never thought once to browse through it, after all, who would be interested in some tournament which took place in Zurich in 1953?  And who in the world was Bronstein? I soon found out: Bronstein was a very strong contender for the world championship in his day and a brilliant annotator.  1953 in Zurich saw the occurrence of a candidates' tournament which featured the strongest competitors of that era (Smyslov, Najdorf Keres, Reshevsky, Petrosian, Geller, Kotov, Taimanov, Averbakh, Boleslavsky, Szabo, Gligoric, Euwe, Stahlberg and Bronstein) all vying for the chance to play for the world championship!  Smyslov triumphed this time around and Bronstein (who came in second along with Keres and Reshevsky) was persuaded to annotate the book of the tournament.  After reading and playing through the first game, I knew I had a treasure on my hands and why my fellow players did not want anyone else to find it.  It's a jewel...find it, read it and try to keep it from your rivals because it'll only make your competition stronger, as my Chess pals found out the next time I played them!	2001-06-12

It's eminently readable, simple and clear.  The advice given is filled with common sense and the reader should be able to utilise them without too much trouble.  A slight drawback is the fact that there isn't that much new or original material (hence the four instead of five starts).	2001-05-29

What is immediately noticeable about this book (apart from its size!) is the last name of the author: Polgar.  One immediately wonders if there's any relation to the Polgar Phenoms (the &quot;PP&quot; sisters, I call them) and whatdayaknow, it's none other than their father (and first coach) Laszlo.  To have such a pedigree is quite nice for a Chess book and it doesn't disappoint.  Filled with all those problems, combinations and games, there's plenty for everyone regardless of their Chess strength.  The one-move-mates were a little too easy until I realised the author's intent must have been to reinforce by repeatition the basic mates that any Chess player worth his salt simply must know.  A job well done.  4 stars for the effort, the remaining star witheld-after all, it's only a problem book!  ;-P	2001-05-25

Yes, I am that most dreaded of things: an average player. Thus, it was with trembling hands I first held this book; after all, it did say it was written for the average player (and book titles are never wrong, right??) Harding, like most British authors, has a most precise writing style that immediately and without fuss imparts the necessary knowledge and goes on its way.  A sort of knowledge 'drive-by'.<br />Sure, it covers the same things the others in this genre of books do: the checkmates, the combinations, the planning methods and all the other things the Chess aspirant should know but what is different is hard to describe without reading this paragon of instructional books. Suffice it to say it does its job very well. 5 stars.<br />And maybe, one day, with much work and many grey hairs, I will be called to the Chess equivalent of Valhalla, handed my GrandMaster title certificate and beams of light from on-high will descend and &lt;slap!> oops, sorry, daydreaming again! ;-) Good book, ... (It's DOVER!) and worth buying!	2001-05-25

Silman's other works have been highly praised and fittingly so and this his latest work will further enhance his well-earned reputation as one of the best Chess authors to put pen to paper, period! A word of caution: be prepared to work, hard!  Not for the casual reader, this book requires active and intelligent participation. His other earlier books outline Silman's method, a checklist, if you may, of points to consider when devising a plan of action and he expects the use of this system to solve the problems in the WorkBook.  He does provide a brief introduction to his system of &quot;imbalances&quot; in a section he calls a 'crash course'  A good idea would be to read his other books 'The Amateur's Mind' and 'How To Reassess Your Chess' as they both explain the system in greater detail.  It is not a requirement as he points out but you won't regret the purchases. So, to summarise: buy this book and actually use it!	2001-05-11

Winning Endgame Knowledge in One Volume (Comprehensive Chess Course Series)	Books	3	16	23	N	N	Good enough	Let's get one thing straght about this series by Alburt et al: it's not stellar in any way and certainly contains no scintillating discovery of a new method.  There is one thing which does shine through these books: the hype is unsurpassed! The authors cannot contain themselves long enough in the pages before splashing someone's biography complete with their availability for lessons, their rates, their 'phone numbers and what they had for dinner last night! (just keeeedink!;-).  People, I already BOUGHT the book, I don't require commercials while reading it.  This was a disconcerting aspect of reading it.<br />On the other hand, it does contain the necessary material for the student to play the endgame at a reasonably high level of understanding.  The layout is good and color is used to good effect to highlight important points.  It would have received a fourth start but I don't think it's worth the price they're asking. A better book at a better price for beginners would be Silman's Endgame book, check it out.	2001-05-11

One does indeed get that feeling from reading &quot;Improve Your Chess Now&quot; in that it details what the ordinary joe can do to improve, with much work, their Chess abilities. Tisdall has put a lot of work into the production of his book almost to the point that we can say it was a labour of love.  It is filled with insightful observations and numerous tips on how to get better. Particularly interesting are his theories on blindfold Chess and to what extent it can help improve one's game (read the book to find out!). Unfortunately, your average Chess player may not be able to adequately utilise the material in the book but for those more advanced players who can, it will become an indispensible manual for how to play Chess and still be human.	2001-05-11

Mr. McWhorter has managed, with aplomb and sound reasoning, to show, if not the light, then the tunnel at the end of which we shall see the light. As an African-American in the most literall sense of the word (my mother is from West Africa, my father a White American), I have always felt most Black Americans have little reason to complain, living as they are, in the greatest country on Earth with all the advantages that offers. Most Africans would give their first-borns (and the most desperate do!!) to live here despite all the &quot;racism&quot; that so plagues the Black American. I have also been appalled at the general illiteracy that permeates Black America, almost to the point of rejoicing in ignorance. You will not find such a situation in many African countries where the search for knowledge occupies the hearts and minds of most people from cradle to grave so I know it's not a question of &quot;Blackness&quot; but one of culture. This wonderful book has buttressed some of my discoveries, dispelled others but in the end, definitely answered a lot of my questions.	2001-04-30

I grew up in Nigeria, my mother being an Ibo woman from Bendel (now Delta) state. Karl Maier has captured the essence of the country without waste or want: this beautiful country is in deep trouble. It doesn't take much genius to see this but Maier has gone one step further (a step the country's leaders have been unable or unwilling to take all these years) and suggested a solution to the problems (read the book to find out) and that's really where this book shines.  It is a thought-provoking treatise but more than this, it is a call to action and action is what Nigeria and Nigerians need; action in the right direction!	2000-12-04
