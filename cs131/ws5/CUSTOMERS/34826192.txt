This is a welcome work on the history of Jugoslavia under German and Italian occupation, sheding light on some unexpected facets of life during the period in question. <br /> <br />Apparently, despite all the Communist propaganda about the Partisans, they were no more successful in fighting their occupiers than the regular Army in 1941. In fact, they, like the royalst Chetniks, the Croats of the Independent State of Croatia, the Slovenes, the Bosnian Muslims (whom Croats claimed to be their kin) and the Serbs under Nedic were more interested in slaugthering each other above all else. <br /> <br />What is surprising are that, <br /> <br />1. Serbia under German occupation was a pacified country, despite all the traditional hatred between the Germans, and especially the Austrians and the Serbs. <br />2. That the German occupiers did save a lot of Serbs from the bloodthirsty Croats. <br />3. That the Italians were as atrocious as the Germans in terms of the burning of villages, looting of livestock and shooting of hostages. <br />4. That most of the Partisan activities occured in Croatia, though mostly from the Serbs there fighting it out with the Croatian authorities of Pavelic. <br /> <br />What is also surprising, but regrettable is that the author has tried to exculpate the Croatian atrocities against fellow Serbs by blaming them on Pavelic and his followers, that he has all but ignored the atrocities of the Moslems, Serbs and especially the Partisans in the internicine strife. <br /> <br />Tomasevich also sheds light on the pathetic incompetence and fighting quality of the Croats and the Bosnian Moslems, as against the Serbs (historically one of the most martial Slav races), as well as on some obscure units like the Serbian Protection/Volunteer Corps. <br /> <br />All in all, a well researched book on the country at war and under foreign rule, but marred by the author's attempt, as a Croat, to blame all and sundry on Pavelic and his uncritical praise of the Communist.	2005-08-20

What's amazing is that he has not even read Paul Schroeder's work on the origins of the War, which concluded that the War was as much the responsibility of the British (who wants the destruction of the Dual Monarchy ever since the Crimean War) as the Germans and their sidekicks, the Austrians.

This despite the fact that under Speer, Germany in 43 and 44 managed to produce a lot more armaments and was fighting on all fronts againat not just the Soviets, but the Anglo-americans too. <br /> <br />What Reinhardt has forgotten is that all along Hitler was bent on capturing/destroying the military/industrial complexes of Russia, and that he plainly disagreed with the OKH's obsession with Moscow and the destruction of Russia's army, as Hitler believed that by depriving the Soviet hordes of arms,  its inexhaustible manpower will count for nothing. <br /> <br />This book also reveals the OKh for what it was,  a bunch of armchair generals like Halder who was never near the front, fought his last war decades ago and had no idea what modern warfare is.	2005-06-03

This is one of the very best book on the Luftwaffe by serious, academic historian, and possibly the only one to date to give credit and recognition to one of the best tactical minds of he Luftwaffe, GFM von Richtofen.      While justifiably lambasting the Luftwaffe (and Hitler too) on its short  sightedness in forgoing the development of a strategic, heavy bomber in favour of tactical, short range fighters and light payload bombers, Hayward does remind us the indispensable role of the Luftwaffe as the Heer's flying artillery and its role in her battlefield successes.    The fact that the Luftwaffe was staffed mainly by transferees from the Heer may be a determining factor in shaping its mission as a tactical, close support airforce, and its reluctance to develop, acqueisce or sustain a naval air arm for the tonnage battle in the Atlantic (same can be said of Raeder's and Dnitz's strategic shortcomings, both concentrating on their respective favourites, battleships and U-boats, while paying little heed to the crucial role of air cover for naval actions) may stem from the tradtional rivalry during the Kaiser's times between the senior service, Army and the Kaiser's favourite, the Kriegsmarine, which in the Great War proved to be a less than war winning tool, and a dtermining factor  (with her mutinies) in the dissolution of the Reich.    It is amazing that nobody in the top echelons of the Luftwaffe had articulated a strategic vision for the role of the service in war. Same with the Krigesmarine with its focus and fetish on battleships and U boats.    Bearing in  mind that Germany was flanked by her traditional enemies in Europe, and the need for the avoidance of the nightmarish 2 front war like the last war, which stretched Germany to her limits as a middling power battling the superpowers (Britain, Russia and USA), the much vaunted General Staff  as well as OKW, OKH. OKM. OKL had not seen the need for a strategic airforce of long range fighters and high altitude heavy bombers (plus aircraft carriers for the inevitable last fight with the US after mastery of Europe) that will serve as a deterrent in any enforced peace with Britain and USSR, or as an indisepnsable deep penetrating tool for crippling her enemies' military-political-industrial complexes, the cross-Channel invasion of Britain, the strangling of trans-Atlantic trade between Britian and her Dminions as well as her banker, the US.    Inter-service rivalry will see the Luftwaffe refusing to build up a naval air arm, or let the Kriegamrine to have one, nor did the latter, with its uni-dimensional focus on the war at sea, see the need for aircover and aircraft carriers ( all because of the myopic expedient that for the same amount of steel, you can build 20 U boats in a shorter time)  for her naval units. This led to the loss of aircover over her bases, and drove the U boats underwater (thus limiting her striking power as they fought on the surface!) and her surface units immobilised in hideouts in France and Norway.    Without a strategic airforce, and with the loss of air supremacy at home and above the battelfields, Germany suffred from the vicious cycle of loss of aircover, then devastated industries, then even less aircrafts, arms and munitions to fight off her enemies on all fronts,and so on. In the end,  the  Luftwaffe was no more than the Heer's last  mobile artiller and machine gun battalions (most of the Heer's artillery was horse drawn) and the Kreigsmarine an impotent coast guard.    It would be interesting to see if, like the Generalstab, most of the Heer transferees were artillerists ( the most technical proficient branch and thus uniquely suited to the technically most demanding service), who with their  mindset would predisposed them to a tactical, close support vision of the Luftwaffe	2005-01-24

Hence the \\"tonnage\\" strategy which aims to sink as much food and fuel oil transports as possible. <br /> <br />For Japan, her aim is to secure the resources in South and Southeat Asia for a long term defense of her conquest, and to fend off the expected US counterstrokes after Pearl Harbour. With the invasion of Hawaii being a no goer, Japan aims for an ironcald ring around her possessions, and fight off all inturisions with force. hence her \\"big guns\\" strategy which seeks out to meet, and destroy US carriers and battleships.	2005-01-10

However, after the war in the Enisatzgruppe Prozess, only a few of the responsible SS and Police men were executed, and most were left off scotch free or had their sentences commuted. This certainly boggles the mind as if justice has been, or seen to be done in this most horrendous chapter of European history. <br /> <br />The book is, however, weakest in its concluding pages, when it is surmised, from chronological matches, not documentary evidence, that Hitler, confident of imminent victory in Russia, ordered the implementation of the Final Solution., and that, in order not to incriminate himself, had not laid down a written order for same. <br /> <br />Bearing in mind that Hitler himself signed an order for the euthanasia of the crippled and feeble in Germany, as well as the Kommissarbefehl that ordered the German troops to shoot all Communist functionaries and army commissars on sight, with no recourse to courts martial, the fact that there was no written order for the gassing of the Jews, if that was Hitler's intention, must be out of character of him. <br /> <br />The fact that Heydrich seeked and got from Gring authority for a Final Solution will be hard to explain, if Himmler and Heydrich, as surmised by Browning, had been authorized by Hitler to proceed with full powers the physical destruction of European Jewry in October 41, in expectation of the defeat of Russia. <br /> <br />The fact that more Jews were gassed in the period 42-44, when Germany was clearly on the losing side in a world war would also be at odds with the Browning hypothesis that the escalation and radicalization of anti Jewish measures, from expulsion, ghettorization,mass shootings to gassing, was always tied to Hitler's estimation of his chances of winning the war.	2005-01-07

This is a most commendable work from Browning, an internationally repescted Holocaust researcher who conclusively demonstrated that Hitler, while desiring of the cleansing, ie, forcible expulsion, of the Jews from German dominated Europe, in one way of another, had never decreed  that the Final Solution , as coined by Himmler and his deputy, Heydrich,  should  end in the death camps and gas chambers.<br /><br />The radicalization and escalation of measures against the Jews  mostly originated from his underlings who competed for brute power in a polycratic, darwinist bureaucracy, and who sometimes paid little attention to Hitler's expressed wishes, unless they were set down as written directives.<br /><br />On wonders all those counter factual arguments puit forth by the Intentionalists that Hitler, mindful of the adverse consequences (!) of a written directive putting Jews to death,  was careful not to lay down a paper trail leading to him as the main culprit, when Hitler himself signed a directive for the forced euthanasia of  crippled , mentally handicapped, and deformed GERMAN babies and old people (what would cause a greater outcry amongst the Germans, should a directive be found, one for disposing of thier own kin and the other of the despised Jews?).<br /><br />As from 1939, Hitler, as evidenced by all the OKW/OKH/OKL/OKM dairies as well as his so called table talk,concerned himself exclusively with foreign diplomacy or his campaigns, and never gave much thought about domestic politics or internal administration, thus leaving a void for his cohorts to enagage in a free for all power grab, with to each his own interpretation of what Hitler mentioned as the end of Jewry in Europe, and each and everyone going for increasingly radical measures as justification for aggregating addtional power/authority to oneself.<br /><br />All in all, this is a sad book to read of the fate and treatment of the Jews by their persecutors, tormentors and executioners, be they Germans, Lithuanians, Estonians, Latvians, Hungarians, Romanians, Bulgarians, Dutch, French, Italians, Russians, Slovaks, Czechs, Serbs, Croats, Albanians, Belgians, Greeks....ans, Hungarians, Romanians, Bulgarians, Dutch, French, Italians, Russians, Slovaks, Czechs, Serbs, Croats, Albanians, Belgians, Greeks....	2004-12-28

So what we have is a book full of typographical errors, lousy maps, and verbose, redundant observations (which proved to be true and obvious) that the Luftwaffen Felddivisionen was a waste of precious manpower and a futile vanity play of Gring. <br /> <br />What the author has missed, in his mouthing of the post war spin by the Heer that the excess Lutwaffe personnel should better be turned over for rebuilding/replenishing the Heer divisions after Stalingrad, is the fact that while, despite the opposition and discrimination by the Wehrmacht, the Waffen SS managed to build a formidable force with mostly Volksdeutche conscripts (who were supposed to be of inferior quality to the Reichdeutsche), the Luftwaffen Felddivisionen, consisted mostly of better educated, top drawer Reichdeutsche, were abject failures, even after being incorporated into the Heer in November 43. <br /> <br />And the gross stupidity of the Heer, after taking over the divisions as Felddivisionen (L.), in going for a 3 regiment (of 2 battailon each) organizational structure (instead of the existing, understrength 2 regiment x 3 battailon each) when it knew that the major defects of the LFD were a shortage of qualified field officers (this applies also to the regular Heer divisions) never crosses Munoz's mind, himself totally engrossed by the post war crap spinned by the few German authors who wrote on the <br />subject. <br /> <br />The crux of the matter was that not only should the LFD never be built, but that the valuable manpower should be alloted to the Waffen SS, which has proven to be much more capable, without the help of the Heer, in building an elite fighting force, even with much poorer human material, than the hidebound Heer could ever iamgine.	2004-12-26

By implying that the Nazis were mostly Protestants and renegade Catholics, he's laying the balme for the Final Solution squarely on the Christians and their beliefs.<br /><br />The fact that most of the Nazis did talk about God, Providence and the like does not equate to a belief in organized Christianity, so  the fact that some denounced the Churches  does not mean that they had renounced Christian values.<br /><br />The author is at a loss to discern that Christian values (aka morality) are mostly a function of socialization, and that there is no total identification between Christian values and beliefs (which is more eccelsiatics and dogmas, as preached by the Churches).<br /><br />Thus Nazis could have Christian values yet loathed Christian beliefs should be no big deal at all to everyone except the author, what with his muddled thinking and incomplete, disjointed thesis never did more than scratched the surface of the subject under investigation, least of all bringing any new insights.	2004-12-23

She also exposes the innate anti German bias of the Fifth Estate, as well as the perfidy and treachery of the British in sowing/fanning the flames of US hatred for Germany, while appeasing the US by bending over backwards, in Venezuela, Mexico and Panama    Actually what was most interesting was the last pages when Mitchell cursorilly mentioned the blatant land grabs, occupations and annexations in Carribean and South America in 1915 and thereafter by that hypocritical, amoral imperialist,  Wilson once the Euroepean Powers were heavily engaged in mortal combat, all under the name of protecting freedom, democracy and human rights (sound familiar?).	2004-11-30

SS Kavallerie Division Florian Geyer, originally a non elite unit for anti-partisan warfare in the rear areas of the German Army, yet one which when thrusted with frontline service against the regular Soviet Army, proved itself, imbued with the SS ethos, to be more than equal to its adversaries. <br /> <br />A seond string unit equipped with captured Polish/Czech arms, Florian Geyer, as the years went by, turned itself, with the influx of young Reichdeutsh volunteers and Volksdeutsch conscripts trained in German arms,  into a first rate, horse drawn (like most Heer infanterie units) unit with reputation and prowess to match. <br /> <br />My only gripe is that the history of the unit is a bit sketchy, and you need to look up to some German works to fully appreciate the units' worth.	2004-11-09

And that by a SS Panzer Korps that received no preferential treatment in equipment ( the much vaunted Ferdinand tank destroyer, and the Panther tanks were both issued to Heer units, whose leadership incompetence and lack of elan resulted in grievious losses, especially in abandoned tanks), was relatively  outdated in amour compared to its Russian adversary, yet beat the latter in every encounter. <br /> <br />Compared the SS Panzer Korps singular achievements in the South of the Kursk salient to the miniscule gains made by Walter  Model's <br />armies in the North (spearheaded by Heer units), you notice why the SS was head and shouders above Heer and the Russians in battlefield performance.	2004-11-09

Packed full of petty details and tedious to the extreme, whilst blissfully ignorant of the wider picture, we are bombarded with rubbish that Mussolini is cultivated in arts, music, philosophy, well versed in journalism, pedagogy,self taught and  fluent in English, French and German  (instead of being the typical village fool that he is) and that he has been vastly under estimated by contemporaries and historians alike.     The last years of Mussolini are barely covered in the book, which then digresses to random, irrelevant rantings on post war Fascism, and De Felice's monumental rubbish that tries to restore and repair the bruised reputation of Mussolini, as if he ever had one that matteed.

In it, the author has made some absurd observations that belies his partiality. <br /> <br />1. That Italy's occupation of Abyssinnia was equivalent to German reoccupation of the Rhineland, and if Britain should acquiesce to the latter, it should give de jure recognition of the Italian conquest (by bombs, poison gas, pillage, massacres). It's as if Germany's peaceful reclaiming of what's her rightfully is the same as brute colonialization by the Italians. <br />2. That appeasing Italy should be the policy instead of courting favour with Germany, forgetting the fact that you always appease the strong, never the weak. <br />3. That as if Italy matters when subsequent events showed that she'd just a pygmy amongst giants, and that she lost every war she made. <br />4. That Mussolini was to be trusted to keep his words, conveniently ignoring the fact that he's just an undisciplined, cowardly bully boy with a loud mouth. <br /> <br />In writing the book, Lamb has also chose to omit Italian atrocities and perfidy, and Mussolini came across as a worthy geopolitician. The prose is dry, the narrative is boring, and the observations ludicrous. <br /> <br />There is, in between the boards, only rubbish.

My only gripe is the racist slant of the author, wherein all white soldiers were heros, and Southeast Asian  and Africa mercemaries of the French Expedionary Force, other than the Foreign Legion, were lesser mortals and shirkers(other than a brief mention of some German deserters from the Foreign Legion, it seems that no one white soldier had surrendered or been captured before the very end).  Also the author whilst glorifying the heroics and self sacrifice of the para/legion  officer mafia, had chosen to omit the fact that most of the para/legion officers never fought in the trenches, but opted to stay in the HQ bunker, and most of them were captured alive and unwounded, as attested by period photos. Most of the officer casaulties (and those who suffered most were from the infantry and tank branches, rather than the elites like paras and legionnaires) were self inflicted (suicide) or caused by some well aimed artillery hits on top of a dug out/bunker.    Whilst not denying the bravery of the ordinary soldiers there, I will hesitate to eulogise the French officers, whose negligence, cowardice and incompetence were just too obvious to ignore.    I will also like more reserach on the \\"Rats of Nam Yum\\", those shirkers and deserters who refused to put up a fight. Who were they? Fall implied that they were the Vietnamese, Algerians. Sengelese and Morrocans. But who can be sure?	2004-09-16

Writing only from primary, and mostly unpublished sources, Irving presents a picture of Hitler that is devoid of all cheap demonising and caricaturing, so popular with  lazy, second rate  pseudo historians (Kershaw and Evans come to mind), a man who was duly elected by the Volk, who stood by him till the bitter end (mostly), and who, other than the purge of the SA and its clique of rampant homosexuals, showed a remarkable tolerance of incompetent, scheming politicians and generals (when Stalin would have shot them, they were just cashiered by Hitler).     Once in power, he  delegated authority and responsiblity to his underlings, whilst engrossing himself in his multidinous military campaigns as teutonic warlord and modern day crusader.    Irving also proved that the Final Solution was initiated and executed by his overambitious underlings, who, in competition for Hitler's favour, will go to the extreme in interpreting his sometimes vague directives.

However, it does has its merits in showing that French was not the bloodthirsty, uncaring, blundering stereotype as exemplified by his more infamous contemprorary, Douglas Haig. In the book French was seen to be much depressed by the casaulties of war, and unfairly intrigued against by a whole bunch of unsavoury characters behind his back, like Kitchener, Ian Hamilton,. Haig, Robertson and other assorted incompetents who tried, only too successfully, to blame French for all that was wrong with the BEF.    We are also told of the semi mutiny of the British Army in Ireland as a result of Home Rule,though French's scamdalous private life and his many flirtings outside of marriage are not touched on.

This book suffers from lack of primary researches of any kind, and the author freely dispenses with his own silly observations and unfounded conclusions about a war that he hardly knows, or has researched on, such as when he wrote that the Jutland battle was \\"a tactical shock, but strategic victory\\" when it is plainly docemented that the Royal Navy came out the worse of it, in terms of casaulties and ships sunk. It's also a strategic blunder as all the RN has to do is to mantain a distant blockade of the North sea and the Atlantic, as there is no need for a battle at all as German ships were not designed for long range crusing and combat.<br /><br />The author also claimed that the BEF was the key to final victory in 1918, when the fact was that it was a spent force and all the fighting was done by the elite and relatively fresh Dominion troops from Cananda, Australia, Neew Zealand and South Africa.<br /><br />Haig's cowardly and leisurely existence in a chateau miles behind the line was said to be the proper way to handle a battle, as he can come to grips with the situation in the front. This is plainly cintradicted by his other statement that once battle was joined, there was nothing much, at that time, the generals to do. Sir French's visits to the front as well as the hispitals were said to be unfitting of a CinC, more from a regimental cast of mind. Bearing in mind that for all his 5 years in the Western Front, Haig was under fire only once, and that inadverdently due to a German breakthrough close to his Army HQ, this says a lot of the rubbish spinned by \\"patriotic\\" pseudo historians like Terraine, Warner, Holmes and Sheffield to uphold the tarnished reputation of the Army's generalship.<br /><br />Sheffield and Warner both being lecturers in Sandhurst make one shivers if another war comesalong.	2004-09-13

D.H. was the most \\"educated\\" soldier in the Empire, and arguably the whole Europe, by which Terraine means he's the one who has learned the art of war and applied them successfully, this in contrast to the accepted view that D.H. is a blockhead, a total idiot who can think of nothing else but attrition, and one who failed his Staff College examination!<br /><br />2. That D.H., in his doctored war diaries, managed to predict the shape of war to come (long, industrialized) and the means to win (RFC, tanks, trench mortars)while ignoring the fact that he won nothing onb his own!<br /><br />3. That Haig's GHQ is the most competent and professional one in the war, that despite the contempt and hate the Tommies held to Haig and his band of cowards, who never once visited a divisional HQ, not to mention the trenches, and whose tactics consist solely of costly frontal assaults preceded by heavy artillery bombardment, and the wholesale scapegoating through sacking of commanders when those attacks failed<br /><br />4. Terraine has also conveniently omiited the fact that Haig owed his Staff College admittance through his frienship and more with the homosexual clique at Court, people like Lords Esher and Kitchener, and that he replaced French through his constant sniping and intrigues behind his superior's back,with the full support of his homosexual buddies Esher, Kitchener, Robertson (CIGS) and King Edward.<br /><br />5. Terraine also omitted to mention that Haig, as armchair strategist, had never fought a battle, and as a lifelong coward, always cowered in his luxurious GHQ miles behing the line, enjoying fine food, wines, horse riding, chess and more.<br /><br />All in all, a most despicable attempt to rehabilitate one of the biggest asses in the history of warfare.	2004-09-08

Rawlinson, one of the least endowed generals in the Western front, is portrayed as one who came up with a formula for decisive breakthroughs, ie masses of artillery punching gaps in trenchlines for the tanks and infantry to smash through. He is credited with creeping barrages and more,apparently the authors are ignorant of Colonel Bruchmller of the Imperial German Army, arguably the best artillery brain in the 2 world wars. Without any references to German sources, the book is essentially a biased and flawed revisionist attempt to portray the British Army as the sole factor in the collapse of the German Army, despite all the evidence that the British Army was a spent force in 1918 and that the so called caollapse of the Germans was essentially a well planned retreat. Rawlinson's bite and hold tactics (in essence attrition a la Verdun) is glorified as the secret formula to success in the battlefield, and the British are said to be experts in a war of technology whereas the Germans still cling to human wave assaults in 1918! <br /> <br />All in all, not a book to seek out historical truths, rather a lame attempt to glorify the British with being the innovators and masters in the art of war.	2004-09-06
