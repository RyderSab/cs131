The DSM IV-TR is a great book to promote diseases that fit the armaments of medications that the pharmaceutical companies would like physicians to use.<br />The problem with the whole DSM serie is that it is mostly subjective and based on speculation. The DSM is not based on hard empirical evidence but on a consensual system by few well-connected psychiatrists on the payroll of the pharmaceutical companies working only as \\"consultants\\" to avoid conflict of interest, which would allow them to continue to receive the loot. These same psychiatrists also happen to belong to the American Psychiatric Association and/or work as hired guns/consultants for the APA, which also happens to receive yearly funding or gifts (disguised as continuing education) from the pharmaceutical companies $500,000 worth.<br />The whole process is deceitful and shameful!!!<br />Please check the Washington Post article on 04-20-06 titled:<br />\\"Experts Defining Mental Disorders Are Linked to Drug Firms.\\"<br />It will validate what I have been exposing for a long time.<br />Also attached below the Abstract for the study:<br /><br />\\"Financial Ties between DSM-IV Panel Members and the Pharmaceutical Industry<br />Lisa Cosgrovea, Sheldon Krimskyb, Manisha Vijayaraghavana, Lisa Schneidera<br /><br />aUniversity of Massachusetts, Boston, Mass., and<br />bTufts University, Medford, Mass., USA<br />Address of Corresponding Author<br />Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics 2006;75:154-160 (DOI: 10.1159/10.1159/000091772)<br />  Key Words<br />* Conflicts of interest<br />* Ethics<br />* Financial interests<br />* Psychopharmacologics<br /><br />  Abstract<br />Background: Increasing attention has been given to the transparency of potential conflicts of interest in clinical medicine and biomedical sciences, particularly in journal publishing and science advisory panels. The authors examined the degree and type of financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry of panel members responsible for revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM). Methods: By using multimodal screening techniques the authors investigated the financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry of 170 panel members who contributed to the diagnostic criteria produced for the DSM-IV and the DSM-IV-TR. Results: Of the 170 DSM panel members 95 (56%) had one or more financial associations with companies in the pharmaceutical industry. One hundred percent of the members of the panels on 'Mood Disorders' and 'Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders' had financial ties to drug companies. The leading categories of financial interest held by panel members were research funding (42%), consultancies (22%) and speakers bureau (16%). Conclusions: Our inquiry into the relationships between DSM panel members and the pharmaceutical industry demonstrates that there are strong financial ties between the industry and those who are responsible for developing and modifying the diagnostic criteria for mental illness. The connections are especially strong in those diagnostic areas where drugs are the first line of treatment for mental disorders. Full disclosure by DSM panel members of their financial relationships with for-profit entities that manufacture drugs used in the treatment of mental illness is recommended.\\"ltimodal screening techniques the authors investigated the financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry of 170 panel members who contributed to the diagnostic criteria produced for the DSM-IV and the DSM-IV-TR.

She gives her readers the impression that an army of sociopaths are lurking among us !!<br />Stout would make a good novelist. Her style of writing is emotionally appealing and eloquent, but psychologically I found in her book only old information and no new discoveries about the sociopathic mind and personality.<br />However, this book will make a fun reading for the inquiring mind, and a great material for paranoid lay people that are interested in analyzing each other and persecuting anyone they dislike.<br />I wonder if Stout's boss at Harvard University Lawrence H.

The majority of Americans assume that the Federal Reserve Bank is a Federal institution operated by the government.<br /><br />The reality is that the Federal Reserve is a pseudo-public entity that is privately operated and owned by 5 to 6 private banks in Europe and the United States. The creation of the Federal Reserve marked the beginning of the privatization of our political institutions, national resources and money. The Government borrows money from the Federal Reserve and in return the Federal Reserve banks receive government bonds. In other words, the Federal Reserve Bank and its owners possess the Federal Government and the American public through the trillions of dollars we borrow from them yearly. The deeper in debt our government becomes, the more ownership the Federal Reserve will have over our lives.<br /><br />Murray Rothbard is an opponent of the Federal Reserve system, and in his book \\"The Case Against The Fed\\" he discusses his economic views and makes his case against them. His book will give the reader a basic ecconomic review, and a historical perspective of the Federal reserve and its creation, as well its impact on our lives and its modus operandi.

Friedman has written a classic book on capitalism that has sold over half a million copy. The most interesting element of his book is that Friedman has accused the Federal Reserve Bank to be responsible for the depression of the 1930s due to their lack of interference by not helping the failed banks and by contracting the money supply. The Federal Reserve Bank is in charge of creating money whenever it is needed, in order to prevent such occurences as major recessions and depression.(The Federal Reserve Bank is embodied in five to six privately owned banks in Europe and America that took over the central financing of the United States in 1913 during the Woodrow wilson presidency when the Federal Reserve act was passed, which marked the beginning of the privatization of American financial and political institutions into the hands of the global corporate world).<br />Friedman has borrowed most of his concepts on capitalism and freedom from the father of free market economy the brilliant Austrian economist Friedrich Von Hayek, and made them his own.<br />This book will provide the reader with an interesting perspective on free market economy and the elusive concept of freedom.	2005-03-19

Losing your courage is losing your heart and becoming dead while you're alive. Reading this book might get you back in touch with your pulsating heart and might awaken your courage that was once decimated by the clamorous world of socialization and survival.

It is books like the Armageddon Network that make people sick, because it reveals how corrupt their government is. It also unveils the blatant arrogance of the self-serving elites and  untouchables. The elites genuinely believe that the majority of the people are stupid, therefore, they can get away with anything. I think the majority of people are too afraid to see the truth, because it is extremely unsettling to go against one's own political socialization and training, and the alternative for that is denial. Denial makes a great coping mechanism.<br />The Armageddon Network is a well documented and written expose. It is highly recommended for the curious mind!	2005-01-14

I admired Griffin's courage when I read his recent book \\"The New Pearl Harbor\\" and I became a fan of his. His new book \\"The 9/11 Commission Report Omissions and Distortions\\" is thorough, well argued, and factual, and was even reviewed by a bunch of outstanding cast. I am not surprised that this genre of books is allowed to be published these days, because black outs are much stronger than blatant censorship. Blackouts by the corporate media maintain the illusion of freedom of speech, and at the same time ensures that only few people read these books. Blackouts negate the book and the author and indirectly classifies him or her in the leftist, unpatriotic, conspiracy nut categories. Questioning authority figures has become unnatural to us, it goes against our political socialization training and creates in us discomfort and dissonance. However, Denial is a much more effective coping mechanism for our pathological survival. If you deny it, it doesn't exist, and everyone will live happily ever after.<br />I would also like to applaud Falk, the distinguished professor from the Council on Foreign relations that has once again reviewed Griffin's new book, and has the courage to go against his buddies and fellows from the CFR that headed the 9/11 commission like Lee Hamilton, Philip D. Zelikow, John Lehman, and Thomas Kean. The problem I have is that it is hard for me to believe what the CFR talking heads stand for, because they tend to argue both sides of the issue to confuse and befuddle people, and give them the impression that democracy is at work, while the synthesis/solution has already been decided by them.<br />Anyway, and once again Kudos to Griffin!! Another great book and another blackout by the corporate media! Griffin, keep writing and sending your ethical thoughts and decent vibrations into the universe, maybe and only maybe the universe will respond back...............	2005-01-14

Allen's book is a great barometer and indicator that in the last thirty five years nothing has changed. Few informed people talked about conspiracy then, and the very few still talk about it now. As the late Carroll Quigley (an official elite historian) stated once in his book Tragedy and Hope, that \\"nothing can be done about it (the conspiracy) it was too big and too late to stop it, and the best way to deal with it is to accept it.\\" It was too late to use this word \\"conspiracy\\" when this book was written, because, these conspirators have been the lawful rulers of the world for years, and what might have started as a conspiracy has become legitimate, because these elites write the laws that behoove them and advance their agendas.They have legitimized their powers ranging from banking, to politics, to the media, to the military industrial complex, and they even intermarried to keep the bondage power and wealth among themselves. The same elitist families (Mafia like), their children, and their grand children continue to rule today and will also rule tomorrow. Different faces but the same process. The media and the propagandists have always liked to capitalize on the word conspiracy, in order to negate it and to nullify any valid argument from the believers or the new discoverers of their plot, and that in turn discredit these believers and makes them look like conspiracy nuts bordering insanity.<br />Allen's book was a great reading when it was published over thirty years ago, and still is a great book that elucidates the process of elitism.	2004-12-30

Nothing has changed since this book was written. The process of globalization has occurred, and the same people and their children continue to dictate domestic and world policies.<br />\\"The USSR was made in the USA.\\" A great and chilling statement! The elites like to create conflicts in order to advance their agendas of global domination. So in order to create conflicts that the public approve of and to maintain the illusion of democracy, they have to create monsters that scare people enough to support their conflict. Every few years a new monster appears on the world stage, from Nazism to Communism/Sovietism to today's Islamism. What's next ? Chinism or Indianism? we are building these two large and highly populated and competitive countries to become great economic and military powers that will eventually clash with each other if the right strategies are put in place. That will make a great and profitable conflict for the military industrial complex, which will reduce population and incorporate these broken countries into the new world order and the one world government. However, if the elites can't instigate a popular conflict, they will keep lending these poor countries money at the American taxpayers' expense, and when they can't pay it back, or their economic bubble explodes, the elites own them.<br />Skousen's book is ageless, and makes a great reading for the curious mind.	2004-12-30

Marrs's book is another expose about the complicity versus incompetence theory. The problem with this theory is that complicity will never be proven; because if it does, then the world order and the make up of power will change, and the distrust in government will reach its ultimate peak, and that in itself would lead to anarchy. That is why the Kennedy assassination per example, remains a mystery, and that is why people are uncomfortable with conspiracy theories !<br />However, incompetence is a much better and acceptable scenario when it comes to the federal government. When a federal agency claims incompetence for its mistakes, it will receive more funding and more human resources, and will eventually expand to a bloating level in order to reduce these mistakes. Ironically, whenever an error occurs, it is usually blamed on that same bloated bureaucracy that was expanded to begin with to resolve that same problem. It is an interesting cycle, nevertheless a vicious one.<br />Are you confused yet? If you are, that is good ! Because that is the whole idea, which is to remain in a state of confusion; therefore, we accept whatever we are told, and that in turn would reduce our inner conflict about two opposing ideas, that eventually force us to choose one, in order for us to quell that inner conflict and regain our inner balance and harmony.<br />Anyway, Marrs's book is concise, blunt, and straight to the point. It is filled with well known and overwhelming facts.  It will provide the reader with a speedy and interesting perspective on the 9/11 events.	2004-12-06

Still's New World Order: The ancient plan of secret societies will make a great reading for the curious and brave mind that's willing to explore and learn the facts about the evolution of the elitist societies. Many of these secret societies have gone through a major metamorphosis that has led them to become legitimate entities and organizations. These organizations have been ruling every aspect of our lives for many years. Just like in organized crime, these powerful families even tend to intermarry among each other to strengthen the bond of power and wealth among themselves. They are the invisible rulers of the world that make the policies which in return bring them more money and power. You will learn in this book how it all started and why it will never end. This is not a book about evil, or about a doomsday scenario, but it is a book about man's desperate quest, obsession, and addiction to power, control, and aspiration to become god. The one world order (globalization is another benign name for it) has already happened and no one can stop it. The elites have facilitated the wedding of the global corporations to the political world, thereby creating a conquering hybrid machine which has tremendously succeeded in subjugating every corner of the globe economically and militarily if needed. This book will provide the reader with enlightening concepts that might be so shocking to believe. Still's research is disturbing and unsettling but very well documented and mostly accurate.	2004-11-26

Political socialization has taught us obedience and trust in authority figures. Questioning these authorities can get you labeled as unpatriotic or as a conspiracy lunatic. By scaring people and/or by belittling them the truth gets buried.<br />The Council on Foreign Relations has been and continues to be one of the elite's major vehicle that creates and dictates domestic and foreign policies. Perloff's book is not about a conspiracy theory, it is about a fact of life that might have started as a conspiracy, but no longer is. Everything is in the  the open. The elites have legitimized their power by co-opting the bankers, the politicians, the media moguls, the corporate CEOs, the Ivy league school presidents, and even many of the world selected leaders. One world order and globalization have always been the CFR primary agenda. Creation of conflict in the world is the key policy toward achieving this goal; because out of conflict comes change. If you manipulate and create an artificial struggle, you will get the change you desire.  The end justifies the means! Divide and conquer!<br />These are not just cliches or futile old sayings, they are in fact policies of the CFR. The bottom line, is that the continous creation of well designed conflicts will lead to division of nations and people, and make them more apt to join the global community. That is the key strategy for a successful globalization.<br />Perloff's book is a brilliant expose of the truth. It is well documented and well written.

The grand chess board as suggested by the title discusses the US geopolitical global strategies to maintain world domination.<br />Brzezinsky is a globalist and carries out effectively in his book the policies of his globalist organizations (the Council On Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission). His book has deservingly received grave and impressive reviews by his fellow trilateralists and CFR members.<br />What's bothersome is that Brzezinsky's predictions are not simply a prognostication, but are technically implied policies in the making. It's frightening to become aware of the many vulnerabilities in the world, and the potential for violence in many \\"hot\\" areas, which can be easily inflamed by covert operations. Brzezinsky is an expert in conflict creation. He was once very proud of his Afghani freedom fighters that defeated the Soviet Union.<br />This book provides important and stimulating information for  the average person. It will help you think and even predict future conflicts in the world. The forecasts in this book should be taken seriously by the reader, after all Brzezinsky represents the elite and the policy makers.	2004-10-10

Glassner has writtten a great expose about our delusional and paranoiac media system that perpetuates illusions, delusions, and partial truth, placing us in a constant imbroglio, and rendering our society into a bewildered, scared, narcissistic, paranoid, homophobic, split/schizophrenic, and brainwashed society.<br />Glassner will provide you in his book with truthful material that will encourage the average person to cogitate, instead of simply absorb what the venomous media imbues in our minds.<br />Media 101 teaches that fear works and gets ratings. \\"instill fear in them and they shall follow.\\"<br />The airwaves belong to the public and we should claim it back. We should contact our FCC and demand unbiased, honest, and decent programming.<br />Fear is the driving force and the major psychological component of terror. Fear incapacitates people and renders them impotent. Fear is conducive to regressive behaviors by responsible adults. Fears justifies our willingness to relinquish our most intimate and sacred rights in order to feel safe. Fear is primal. It brings out the primitive and reptilian part of our humanity.<br />It is tragic that the media outlets dictate our lives, educate our children, and shape our daily opinions.<br />We are treated as frightened, dependent, and ignorant children that will follow their parents anywhere to<br />survive.  Walter Lippmann (a media Guru) has called us (the people) the perfect name \\"the bewildered herd.\\" Or are we?

I was very happy to see a prominent physician has finally taken a stand against the giant global pharmaceutical industry. Angell showed courage, integrity, and clarity in her book about the problems we face with the unethical practices of our large corporations that place profits ahead of our safety.<br />Angell has even clearly and bravely exposed the role of the government in enabling the pharmaceutical industry's unethical practices; per example the passing of the PDUFA Act (Precription Drug Users' Free Act) by Congress in 1992, that constituted in my opinion the ultimate ethical violation and a sell out to the pharmaceutical industry, which I have called in my article (see article below for details about the PDUFA Act)an act of terrorism, because of the blatant complicity of the FDA with the Pharmaceutical companies to allow unsafe drugs to be approved for the public.  I have enjoyed Angell's book very much, and I admire her integrity, courage, high ethical standards, and her willingness to speak the truth regardless of the consequences. Her book will provide the readers with an educating and edifying experience.<br /><br />The Federal Drug Administration and the PDUFA Act of Terrorism.<br /><br />Abstract:  The purpose of this article is to explore the function of the FDA its relationship with the pharmaceutical industry, its dilemma between protecting the consumer and betraying their financier, and the ethical question regarding the PDUFA Act that was passed by Congress in 1992, and its impact on our citizens.<br /><br />History:<br />The FDA was established in 1906 as a result of the Food and Drug Act.<br />The FDA's primary mission as an independent watchdog agency was to promote, protect, and improve public health.<br />The treasury department financed the FDA until the year of 1992.<br />In the eighties the FDA received lots of criticism from the<br />pharmaceutical industry for being too slow in approving their<br />new drugs. However, the pharmaceutical industry has been a major<br />contributor for political campaigns, and has increasingly gained clout in Washington. PhRMA (pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of America) is considered one of Washington's most powerful trade groups. They employed about 50 lobbyists in 2001. Senator Dick Durbin a democrat recently stated that \\"PhRMA has a death grip on Washington.\\"(Frontline, 2003).<br />In 1992, the pharmaceutical industry finally succeeded in pressuring congress to pass a legislation that changed the FDA forever.  That year, The PDUFA Act (Prescription Drug Users' Free Act) was passed by Congress authorizing the pharmaceutical companies to hand over money to the FDA, in order to get their drugs quickly approved.<br />PDUFA is a quid pro quo act. If the pharmaceutical company wants a drug to be swiftly approved they would have to pay the  FDA an amount of  up to $500,000 to hire reviewers that in return would review the product and approve It. (FDA website). This represents a major conflict of interest and the ultimate ethical violation. However, the FDA understaffed and underfinanced welcomed the new legislation and the new partnership with the pharmceutical industry.<br />The majority of the American public has never heard of PDUFA<br />and have no knowledge that the independent agency which was once<br />created to protect them, was sold by congress to the highest bidder.<br />The PDUFA Act has resulted in thousands of deaths and innumerable injuries, due to the careless approval of certain unsafe medications by the FDA, in order to please their new masters, the pharmaceutical companies.<br />How can the monitors regulate their employers and the people that pay for their salaries? And who would monitor the monitors?  In these difficult times of economic hardship, wars, and terrorism, the government has expressed an increasing concern over the safety of its citizens. Ironically, PDUFA represents a terrorist act and anti-safety measure that was passed by this same concerned government.<br />According to Frontline a PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) documentary(\\"Dangerous Prescriptions\\"), the pharmaceutical companies have financed 50 percent or more of the drugs that were approved in the past 10 years, and many of the FDA reviewers were and still are afraid to speak out against some of these dangerous prescription drugs. They were coerced by their administrators to get these unsafe medications quickly approved,<br />despite the prolific evidence of their dangerousness and lack of safety; otherwise,  they would face  disciplinary actions and become \\"stigmatized\\" in the FDA (Frontline, \\"Dangerous Prescriptions,\\"2003).<br />The examples of these approved unsafe drugs are many. One recent<br />example is \\"Baycol\\" by the Bayer Corporation. Baycol is an<br />antihyperlipidemic drug also known as a statin a cholesterol-lowering drug. Baycol was responsible for many deaths and injuries, because of its high tendency to cause rhabdomyolysis a deadly condition where the drug induces the destruction of the muscle enzyme. Bayer and the FDA allowed this drug to be  aggressively marketed despite their foreknowledge of its dangerousness based on a study of Baycol versus Lipitor (another popular statin). The study showed that for every 100,000 prescriptions given without other cholesterol drugs, Baycol had 20 times more reports of rhabdomyolysis than Lipitor. (Frontline, 2003).<br />Corporate business 101 teaches that it is cheaper to kill and injure few thousand people and pay settlements, than to pull a product off the market.<br />This is a criminal and reprehensible practice that the pharmaceutical companies and other corporate businesses should be held accountable for.<br />Of course, in this case the FDA has become ineffective and impotent in the face of accountability, so who would fill in this safety gap?<br />PDUFA became PDUFA III in 2002, because congress renewed it once<br />again and for the third time, disregarding the thousands of deaths that ensued from their irresponsible action.<br />The culture of Narcissism and elitism continues to plague Washington and our government, however this reckless disregard for our citizens' safety should not go unnoticed. I urge every citizen to write their congressman and to address the unethical and dangerous nature of  PDUFA and pressure them  to repeal/and or cancel this sinister act that has resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries of innocent Americans and on American soil (not counting the damage overseas) for the past eleven years.<br />References:<br /><br />Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), Frontline Documentary, \\"Dangerous Prescriptions\\", 2003.<br /><br />FDA website, PDUFA III Act.cally, PDUFA represents a terrorist act and anti-safety measure that was passed by this same concerned government.

I was very surprised that a book of this magnitude would be published by a main stream publisher and be reviewed by a prominent cast of reviewers, like Falk from the Council on Foreign Relations.<br />Griffin has demonstrated great courage by writing such a meticulous book about a sensitive and controversial issue with excellent clarity and documentation, without fearing the punitive consequences that would ensue from writing such a book; especially, in these times where freedom of speech and personal liberty are gradually diminishing.  Griffin has made his case clearly and sufficiently. His book will make you think on your own without the help of a television set or a newspaper. I hope that Griffin would be interviewed by the main stream media so more people will read his book, and begin to think for themselves, instead of having the media's talking heads doing the thinking for them. Unfortunately, So far no interviews and no publicity that I am at least aware of. I wonder why? Politically, black outs are better than censorship! Black outs negate the book and the author!!  The controlled media does not report the truth to the public, because truth does not sell, but partial truth, canards, fear, conflicts, violence, and sex are always the big winners.<br />A Good book like Griffin's should receive the publicity it deserves.  I hope, and I only hope that the media conglomerate will learn something about honesty, objectivity, and courage from Griffin!	2004-09-04
