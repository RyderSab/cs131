Over the years I have become very familiar with FrontPage.  When a friend asked for a recommendation for a FrontPage book that could take a person from \\"beginner to expert\\" I looked at a number of possible texts.      After reviewing several I came to the conclusion that this text was the overall best book to buy and keep.  It covers everything Frontpage can do and provides a very well written set of explanations and examples.	2004-10-15

I have been buying and reading &quot;layman&quot; books on modern physics for the past couple of years.  I've read and enjoyed &quot;Black Holes and Baby Universes&quot; by Stephen Hawkings, &quot;Three Roads to Quantum Gravity&quot;, by Lee Smolin, Feynman's &quot;QED&quot; and John Gribbin's &quot;Schrodinger's Kittens&quot;.  My background includes a degree in engineering, but in my opinion a knowledge of math and &quot;textbook&quot; physics is not necessary to read and enjoy all of these titles.   <br />As for &quot;The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality&quot;, it is by far the best and most readable of the modern physics books I have encountered to date.  Greene is truly in a class of his own when it comes to explaining the &quot;almost&quot; unexplainable.  <br />I was amazed at how Greene was able to stay one step ahead of the reader on every page and have answers ready as soon as a question popped into my head.  Greene has that rarest of gifts in a writer; an intimate knowledge of the subject matter, coupled with an intiutive understanding of questions that trouble the reader.<br />In conclusion, if you are going to buy only one book on modern physics, choose this one.	2004-06-23

I'm a Professional Engineer with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and 15 years experience in the field.  As a result, I was living under the delusional assumption that electronics had something to do with electrons.  Fortunate for me, Ken came along and set me free of this silly idea. <br />After all those years of math, physics, and chemistry, I've never been very comfortable with electric shock therapy, or electricity in general.  Ken's book has changed my outlook entirely.  Now I get up in the morning and can't wait to turn on all the electrical gadgets in my house.  <br />I recommend this book to anyone trying to understand electrical theory.  Ken's book is entertaining and very memorable.  He takes one of the most complex topics in modern science and reduces it down to a level that even an engineer like me can understand.... Now that's an accomplishment!	2003-04-17

This is simply a womderful text and should be part of everyone's library.<br />I strongly recommend first reading texts such as Hawking's &quot;Brief History of Time&quot;, Feynmas's &quot;QED&quot; and John Gribbin's &quot;Schrodinger's Kittens&quot; before tackling this text as Smolin's focus is on the latest developments and ideas.

Wow what a great read!  Kip Thorne's now classic text is a amazing follow on for anyone who has already read Steven Hawking's Brief History of Time.

(Or Maybe Not...)	This is an amazing book that gets to the heart of modern physics in an easy (relatively speaking), fast paced manner.  The book provides the historical and scientific context needed to build a &quot;solid&quot; understanding of the accomplishments and limitations inherent in modern Quantum Mechanics.<br />I really enjoyed the way Gribbin was able to weave together a complete story of the development of Quantum Mechanics by explaining the theoretical and experimental achievements of so many of the legendary figures in physics.  His understanding of the topic is extraordinary and makes it possible for him to present page after page of complex ideas in a clear and exciting manner.<br />I have found myself re-reading many sections of &quot;Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality&quot; and each time I find more and more depth to explore.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in Quantum Mechanics and the convergence of physics and philosophy.	2002-03-09

I read and review dozens of technology books for my TrainingCity.com classes every year, and I only recommend a small percentage of them.  Broadband Telecommunications Handbook is among the best.  It's the perfect resource for individuals who need a clear and concise explanation of the technologies encountered in the field every day.<br />The book gets to the heart of modern WAN technologies and explains concepts such as T1 AMI vs. HDSL in an extraordinarily clear and easy to understand manner.

A diagnosis of PDD-NOS was considered due to a range of extremely mild symptoms, but in the end it could not be supported by the various independent professionals we hired.<br />Dr. Sowell's book offers parents an important source of antidotal information that is sorely lacking in the literature. This book must however be read with caution. The numerous stories Dr. Sowell presents are of children who presented only \\"expressive\\" communication disorders. As he rightly points out in the text, the prognosis for children whose expressive and receptive skills are delayed is not necessarily as optimistic.<br />I was troubled by one recurring theme in the text. Dr. Sowell was, in my opinion, overly critical of the medical and educations professionals who are tasked with providing assessments and treatment options for \\"children at risk\\". In my experience in Canada we have found the level of professionalism of local child physiologists, pediatricians, speech therapists, social workers, and many others to be absolutely outstanding. Even our son's nursery school teachers have proven to be invaluable resources in our search for answers to our son's communication difficulties.<br />I am very comfortable recommending this book to any parent whose child \\"does not quite fit\\" the PDD-NOS label. To those who follow though, remember, there are treatment options out there that are based in common sense, and probably do help. Don't use this text as an excuse to not seek advice and assistance. If you suspect a problem begin discussing it with your child's doctor. <br />In conclusion, \\"Late Talking Children\\" offers much need hope, with concrete examples of numerous children. Buy it and read it, but do so carefully. Dr. Sowell is to be commended for his work. (PS, I'm a third generation engineer!)	1999-12-13
