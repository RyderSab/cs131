For example, even in Western society, would it not be polite and politic to accept a piece of chocolate from your boss (even if it is water melon flavored)? I kept having to attribute her maladroitness and incompetence to her young age, but if you make such allowances for the narrator, can you trust the narrator's viewpoint? Some of the tirades against Japanese culture came across as almost vengeful. Also, I would have liked to see more of a context to this story. Again, I kept wondering; what did this girl do in her free time? Toward the end, the narrator explains why there is no mention of her home life, but I felt like this was more of an excuse than a reason. I did admire much of the writing, but the classical references (so many of them) and some of the allegories seemed pretentious and out of place. In summary, I would have preferred either a straightforward satirical/comical account of her experiences, without the personal commentary, or else a more rounded and balanced work. <BR>For those who enjoy reading fiction in French, I recommend the novella &quot;La Classe de neige&quot; by Emmanuel Carrere (sp?), a grippingly disturbing story expertly told through an imaginative and intuitive nine-year-old boy.	2004-07-01

The heroine is undoubtedly shallow and somewhat unscrupulous, but if I'd liked her any better I'd have had heart seizure every time she walked into another embarrassing situation. The best feature about this book, in my opinion, was that it was neatly structured. The increasing tension was well orchestrated, and the characters (other than the Hooray-Henries) were likeable and (other than Rebecca) believable. Unlike with some of the American chick-lit writers I've read, I felt I was in the hands of a pro.	2004-06-18

Touching anecdotes, characters who come to seem as real as members of your own family, beautiful pastoral descriptions. The main flaw to me was confusion at the beginning of the story as to who the narrator was, even though I read Cather's \\"Introduction.\\" Also, I'd have liked to find out what happened to Jim's parents.

First, it's not even bad enough that's it's so bad it's good; it's  mediocre, and in art, even chick lit, there's nothing so bad as mediocre. Second, I can't help feeling that Weiner has disturbing envy issues that come through via her characters. It is just not true that all thin women purge and that overweight women are generally smarter and more humorous. I can only think Weiner has gotten this far by striking a chord with obese and disgruntled women. I read in one of these reviews that Cameron Diaz was being cast as Maggie in the movie adaptation. That fits because I don't rate skinny Diaz either...just to show I'm an equal opportunity reviewer.	2004-05-07

Maybe because I'm sick of graduates in English (and BTW, Proust was not an English writer) or media studies thinking they can write a first person narrative loosely based on their own experiences and substitute pseudo-smart observations for plot, and then call it fiction. Ironically, I got into this novel quicker than other novels of its ilk, but &quot;Good in Bed&quot; (misleading title) lost me forever at page 105. I can't take being inside the head of a mean-spirited, self-absorbed individual anymore, no matter how much I might sympathize with her fatness. Does being fat give you a right to bad manners? Cannie publicly humiliates a man who asks her out for dinner as soon as she finds out it is not a &quot;date.&quot; She is nasty and belligerant to the nurse at the diet clinic. The author (via her character) takes pains to illustrate the injustice of the generalizations and labeling that overweight people are subjected to, and then goes into a spurious and irrelevant spiel about how she doesn't like Celine Dion, her singing, looks or lifestyle, and Canadians in general, it seems. The novel loses all direction after page 60, going off into unedited ramblings, which are less than humorous. Where were the editors? Much of the text should have been excised. The name of a restaurant even changed in the space of one page. I hate it when I'm so blatantly thrown out of a story because of careless editing. Judging by the author's photo, Jennifer Weiner looks like a nice person, but the book lives up to her name.	2004-05-03

As the novel progressed and the characters developed, I steadily gained interest and found the writing elegant and skilful. The names--Mrs. X, Mr. X., Nan, Nanny--were no doubt chosen to lend a tell-all and universal theme flavor, but I think the characters would have worked better with real names. A bit more physical description might not have gone amiss either. I felt captivated by Grayer's character, but I did not have a clear visual of him. Like all good satire, \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" makes a social point. The ending is very poignant. Be prepared to cry if you love children.	2004-03-15

(I found the song-dance routines Andrea had to go through with Eduardo hilarious.) The ending was anti-climatic. Surely a bright girl (Andrea) who knew the inner workings of Miranda Priestly's life could have come up with a more clever and classy way of terminating her relationship with her boss. The ending, like the beginning, was written in that annoying pseudo-sophisticated style found in many women's magazines.	2004-02-28

She did not come across as very smart. Every time she went snooping (which was often), she got caught. She always seemed to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown and drank whenever she got the chance ;-). Hard to imagine how Alex could ever have fallen in love with her! There were a few instances where I felt the plot was stretched too far. The basic plot was great, though, and Anne's betrayal of her best friend, Kate, was well set up. Kate was vividly portrayed, though even by today's standards she was very forward. Not surprising that her life should have come unstuck in the prudish early part of the last century. (I guess Jill inherited her unsmart genes.) I kept hoping she would escape (good suspense here) and that Jill would find justice for her. The end was a bit of an anti-climax.	2004-01-11

It describes her \\"belle vie\\" in the early thirties in Paris. She has a lovely home, a loving husband, and a circle of intellectual suitors. While undertaking huge liberties and deceptions in the name of literature (she uses her writing as an excuse), she yet does so with an almost childlike need for love and acceptance. In explanation, the reader learns that she was infatuated with her father, who later abandons her. The irony of her seducing and manipulating the psychoanalyst who is also treating her husband and incestuous lover is humorous. The insights into her torrid affair with Henry Miller are fascinating. As in her fiction, she displays a knack for tasteful eroticism. She disarmingly admits to her propensity for embellishing reality. Anais Nin is narcissistic, but who could not be fascinated by a woman of such candor, talent, and complexity?	2004-01-11

Myers, Florida, and she has a lovely lulling voice and a truly soft and soothing aura. As to \\"What We Keep,\\" I enjoyed the book, and probably would have enjoyed it even more if I could relate to 50s America, but being as I grew up mainly in England at a later time, I can't.    I felt that a family secret hinted at in earlier parts of the novel but not revealed until late in the text was not satisfactorily addressed by the three women. What did they actually feel about it? It should have had more impact. For 35 years, the two sisters harbor resentment toward their mother based in part on false assumptions. Now they are finally reunited and a slightly different spin is put on past events. Yet, before we know it, the protag is back on the plane and, after a lifetime of being misinformed and angry, seems all of a sudden very accepting of the actual situation.	2003-12-03

The author probably purposefully selected the most ordinary setting she could think of for the tagedy to take place. As you would expect from such a milieu, the characters are ordinary and believable in their ordinariness. I experienced sympathy for the characters, especially the father and son, but I didn't get choked up over the story, which started out as a literary work and metamorphosed into popular fiction, running out of steam at the end.	2003-10-28

The introduction of the characters as they prepare for the Battle of Franklin is masterful and suspenseful. Bushrod and his two buddies from Mississipi are likeable characters, and the reader feels for them as they psyche themselves for battle. There is a little bit of wandering narrative, but the anticipation of the fighting keeps the reader attentive. Then comes a black hole where the battle took place and the reader finds himself in the aftermath of the bloody fighting. This is where the story begins to lack cohesiveness. Bushrod meets Anna in the country house requisitioned for a Confederate hospital. He is concussed and she is crochety. The reader might wonder what draws these two together when there are hundreds of other wounded soldiers to whom Anna might offer so much as a drink of water (but never does). The story disperses into other characters' viewpoints, the simpleton Nebo's and the boy Winder's, to no obvious purpose except to leave the reader impatient to get back to the main story. There is a lengthy description of a wasp making its long and arduous journey toward a lamp, only to keep bumping against the glass (symbolic of the futility of war?). There are the metaphoric refrains of the black horseman and the black flower. There is also much authorial discussion of the passing of time. I would still rate this novel higher than \\"Cold Mountain.\\" There is more plot. The characters engender more compassion because they are nobly, albeit unglamorously, involved in the war (Inman in \\"Cold Mountain\\" has deserted and is finding his way home). After reading \\"The Black Flower,\\" I came away with a memory of beautiful passages and a feeling of despair for the waste of human life.	2003-10-28

I read it in French first, but the translation loses nothing of the suspended breath of emotion so often found in French literature.

Unlike a lot of detective/ thrillers, this novel was easy to follow. However, the characters did not leap off the page and many of the scenarios seemed implausible.

Especially after he shot the bear cub (motivation?). While the writing is beautiful, there is a lot of static description, so that one gets a clearer image of the landscape than of Inman himself. His relationship with Ada appears tepid and comes across as a device/excuse for Inman's odyssey; the author seems more concerned with describing the picturesque characters Inman encounters along the way. The references to the Civil War, however, are stirring in their apparent realism. As with \\"Doctor Zivago\\" and \\"The English Patient,\\" perhaps the screen version will extrapolate more of a plot than was found in the novel? Try THE BLACK FLOWER by Howard Bahr for civil war fiction.	2003-10-05
