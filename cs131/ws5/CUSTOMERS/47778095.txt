US	47778095	R1RORI8F0IMQAD	0971977550	66304600	30 Days Of Night	Books	4	33	42	N	N	Excellent idea and execution	\\"30 Days\\" has a couple of flaws, but it's an involving read.<br />The writing is excellent, I think, well-suited to the medium.  The concept is wonderful and certainly Niles doesn't spare the gore or pussyfoot around the concept of vampires ripping open throats.  He puts in some disturbing imagery and his plotting is close to immaculate.<br />A moment to address the other reviewer's complaints about cliche: Yes, you're right.  Now stop whining.  I doubt much new can be done with vampires, and it's great to see the human battling with the throat-ripping beast without having to deal with Anne Rice's sexual peccadilloes or purple prose.  If Lestat actually existed, I would have purchased a flamethrower for the sole purpose of shutting him up.  And maybe I would have taken out that whiny Louis, too, while I was at it.<br />All praise and defense aside, I suspect Niles was given three issues instead of the four he asked for (or perhaps the four he should have written) and as a result his character development is lacking.  While I think it's great the book hits the ground running, we only really get to know Eben and Stella, and those two we don't know very well, in the end; the townsfolk have maybe a panel or so (few are granted names) and then get turned into hamburger.<br />The art isn't to my taste; I think the murkiness enhances it quite a bit, and there is some absolutely beautiful work with what I believe to be watercolor, but I don't think it would have killed Templesmith to be a bit more traditional and realistic.  The sheer beauty of some panels, especially that opening splash, is absolutely frustrating next to the sloppiness (which I suspect was intentional) of others.  Still, I'll cheerfully grant that it suits the story well.<br />Overall, it's quite a fun read, a little too quick but definitely worth reading.  I suspect the movie will be better, though.	2003-11-28

Shopworn Conventions, and Outdated Archetypes	Books	5	18	18	N	N	One of the most crucial books ever written for filmmakers	If you work as a filmmaker or in television, whether as a hobby, your profession or your obssession, YOU NEED THIS BOOK.  Screenwriters for both film and TV especially need this, since it deals largely with storytelling cliches, but it also lists visual ones in cinematography, in angles, in casting and in general mise-en-scene that it is absolutely crucial for the director to avoid.  This book will make you a better filmmaker just on virtue of being aware of what's been done to death.<br />It's also useful across the board.  While it usually rips into the more standardized genres (like slasher flicks or action movies), it also chainsaws such common cliches as \\"The Pet Homosexual\\" (\\"he can talk endlessly about sex, provided he never has any himself\\", most recent offender: \\"The Next Best Thing\\" and \\"Will and Grace\\"), \\"Baked Potato People\\" (the gentle lunatics in the asylum that show the outside world is crazy; most recent offender: \\"K-PAX\\"), and more subtle ones like the Fat Guy rule; if a group of men are planning an escape, the fat one usually can't be trusted.<br />This is a very funny book, but it's also very true, and if we made everybody currently making movies sit down and read the damn thing, we'd have better movies, or at least different cliches.  Fun for the armchair film freak, but absolutely crucial for the filmmaker.	2002-03-03

You can read a chapter separately, or read the whole thing at one shot, but you keep going back to it and rereading it.<br />Especially useful to film fans and scholars is King's analysis and dissection of the horror movie.  I'm recommending this to a friend of mine in the hopes that he will loosen up a bit after reading King's sometimes-hilarious take on the truly awful horror movies out there.  <br />&quot;Danse Macabre&quot; is both a lot of fun and a great study of an often misunderstood genre.

He's a paranoid schizophrenic who lives in a cave and is a brilliant pianist, able to make the &quot;Mr. Clean&quot; jingle touching (whoever is scoring the movie is going to go through hell pulling THAT one off.)  He also lives in a cave.  He's a homeless man with pride.<br />This mystery is some really sharp stuff.  Green writes with a great skill for placing words and creates some often hysterical vignettes and exchanges, but he's very careful, burying clues, motivations, and other crucial information in the text in such a way that it doesn't seem important until you finish and realize there are no cracks in the armor.  It's meticulous and excellent.<br />This is definitely worth a read.  It's off the beaten path and a good example of technique, well worth the money.	2001-04-14

As near as I can figure out, the &quot;Vurt&quot; is a nanotechnological drug.  Read the book, what I say will make more sense.<br />It's interesting, certainly, but there's really not much of a point to it other than having fun, being a good ride.  I plowed through 220 pages of this waiting for an on a train, that's how fast it can go.  <br />It is a fun read, but it doesn't really tell us anything, nothing like Gibson's future near-noir or Stephenson's hysterical glancing at humanity.

This isn't necessarily a good thing; Matheson could write some good stuff, but his pop-psych/midlife-crisis-philosophy sometimes makes his books hard to take (&quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;, anyone?  Didn't think I'd get any takers.)  &quot;Replay&quot; has this problem, and the recent (and constant) whining of the 60s survivor segment of the Baby Boomers recently about how they're getting old doesn't help much.  <br />&quot;Replay&quot; is okay, despite this, but how this scored a World Fantasy Award (as the back cover claims) is completely beyond me.  You know this plot, especially if you're a fantasy fan.  The book becomes a bit of a pill when we get into the nickel-dime philosophy.  Basically the writing saves this.<br />Ultimately, though, this is basically a &quot;life-affirming&quot; book, and while it may not put you into insulin shock, it's still pretty close to a Hallmark card, nothing new or interesting to say.  Not bad, but I wouldn't pay full price for it.	2001-02-27

Nick Stefanos isn't the nicest guy in the world, but he tries to be a decent person, and when something goes wrong, he feels guilty.  This is the third novel in the series, and we meet Nick as a bartender.<br />To give you an idea of the nature of Stefanos, this novel opens with him going on a pretty bad drunk, passing out by a river, and hearing the murder of a young black man.  He feels guilt, just for being there.<br />This novel's strengths lie largely in the central character and the rendering of modern-day, low-rent Washington D.C.  I grew up in the area, and I have to say, Pelecanos nails it on the head.  Stefanos is also a very sad character which you feel for.<br />The plot is pretty well-done; you can't figure out what's going on on page ten, you actually have to read the book.  Still, Vachss has been in this territory, and his Burke is a bit stronger and more world-weary than Stefanos.  However, this is a pretty good detective novel that I enjoyed a great deal.  Worth reading, a fun work.	2001-02-22

When I found out this was the first book Palahniuk ever wrote (although it's the third to be published.)  It certainly has the major Palahniuk theme; the two extremes, in this case of attention, either everybody loves you or no one will look at you. Duality also plays a role.<br />When I first read this, I thought Palahniuk was slipping a bit; &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a classic and &quot;Survivor&quot; is pretty close.  It's not quite as strong as those two, but since it's his first, that can easily be overlooked.<br />If you go for darkly humorous fiction with a lot of potential shock value, this is the book for you.	2001-02-17

I just knew my father was a fan of the author.  And, I figured, I was a fan of Andrew Vachss, I'd seen and dealt with some pretty nasty stuff.  I could take it.<br />No, I couldn't.<br />&quot;Man's inhumanity to man&quot; doesn't even begin to cover it.  Just nowhere close.  It's not even because of war, it's because these miserable peasants don't know anything else, can't act like anything more than animals.  More than anything else, this book is about just how evil ignorance and intolerance can be.<br />Even worse, the main character, an eight year old child, doesn't have the mental or physical equipment to deal with this enviroment or the complete hell he suffers through.  He just doesn't understand.  It'll gouge at your heart, the way he tries to deal with the cruelty visited on him for no good reason.<br />This is a powerful book, an important book, and one that shows just how awful life can get in an unjust, uneducated world.	2001-02-14

On the contrary, this is an extremely focused, coherent book. As a philosopher, and on his philosophical texts...well, to be totally honest, it's hard for me to take Dick seriously.  There is no denying, however, that this is clearly a thought-out and gripping piece of writing.  As simply a novel about repression, which Dick wrote about masterfully, this is an excellent work. Not as crazy as you might think, and definitely worth a read.	2001-02-12

There's nothing Ballard loves more than microcosms (&quot;Rushing To Paradise&quot;, &quot;Concrete Island&quot;, &quot;Day of Creation&quot;) and in this one, he isolates the factors of human society and puts it up against our animal natures.  The result is as fascinating as it is ultimately horrible.  Very well-written, and strong both as a novel that raises a philosophical question and as a straight-ahead horror novel.<br />On a side note, I found this book in print, new editions, in a couple of major Canadian bookstore chain in Montreal.  Yet it doesn't seem to be in print in the U.S.  What's up?	2001-02-08

We see the bad side of both being in a cult and being part of a massive, media-machine religion, much like &quot;Fight Club&quot; shows the bad side of both mindless materialism and a rejection of materialism so complete you reject yourself.  The similarities, really, end there.<br />&quot;Survivor&quot; is not necessarily a novel about how religion is bad, but rather about how religion taken too far can be a very dangerous and destructive thing.  It has some really deep points to it if you take the time to think about it.<br />Of course, it can also be read just as a black comedy; Palahniuk is funny enough for that.  &quot;Survivor&quot; is a display of inventiveness and some excellent writing.  Buy this, you won't regret it.	2001-01-25

This is a perceptive and actually pretty nasty take on the more extreme ends of enviromentalism and feminism, the points where the former becomes psychosis and the latter becomes sexism of a virulent and violent sort. <br />What I love most about Ballard is his willingness to probe the darker corners of the human psyche.  It's a rare gift to want to explore these places, let alone use them to comment on our society.  This is an excellent book and worth your cash!	2001-01-19

This is an alternate history, where an entire religion has sprung up around the worship of the dead.  Banks has invented a Bible and theology that's highly interesting, and this book is worth reading for just his creation of an interesting world.<br />The book itself is a form of Puritan works, sent by the jailed practitioners to the congregation.  Banks manages to capture the austere yet somehow elaborate Puritan method of writing, while at the same time keeping the book interesting for modern readers.<br />The only point I'm really not clear on is...well...his point.  This is obviously intended as some sort of allegory; why go to the lengths he did just for his own amusement?  But I'm not sure WHAT this allegory is about?  Email any suggestions, I'm genuinely curious as to theories.	2001-01-15

It takes the realistic stance that you probably won't have access to a master teaching this material, and acts accordingly.   The photos laying out the form are clear and concise, and the text instruction is excellent and also very clear.<br />The only problem lies in the line drawings.  While they're generally pretty good, some  of them do NOT make clear how the stance/strike is performed, which makes things confusing when you get to the photos.  The balancing stance drawings, for example, don't show the hands exactly as they're supposed to be (refer to the first practical application in chapter five for the actual positions.)  These are really rather minor, but if you're a rookie like me, it can trip you up.<br />This is a minor complaint, though, for a great book.  If you're interested in this art, pick this book up post haste!	2001-01-14

After reading this, I think Hamilton needs to bring this series to a close.  End on somewhat of a high note, instead of dragging it on forever.<br />First of all, if you're looking for advancement in the whole Jean-Claude/Richard/Anita triangle, don't bother.  Jean-Claude has a cameo in this novel and that's it.  We spend a lot of time with psycho-killer Edward, who Hamilton in the end makes more warm and fuzzy, and his two buddies, the interesting Bernando and the really repugnant Olaf.<br />If you're looking for gore, this is the messiest in the whole series by a good margin.  There's more slicing, stabbing and shooting than an 80s action movie.  Not that this isn't fun in of itself...but Hamilton seems to think she has to make each novel progressively more violent and gory, which she doesn't.  Violence and gore are all well and good...but I dunno, bringing kids into it (two kids get tortured and a zombie of sorts goes crazy in a nursery) really drags down the fun quotient of the series.  Fantasy creatures are one thing, they don't exist, but kids are something else.  It gives Anita that moral avenger sense, but it makes the situation graver than it should be for something like this.<br />Mainly, I picked this up because I wanted to know what the deal was with Richard and Jean-Claude.  I didn't get that and I'm not sure I like what I did get.  Ten is a nice round number; we can tie up all the plotlines in one neat little 400 page bundle.	2001-01-10

Hamilton for Nabokov, but she beats the hell out of Anne Rice, and as this series progresses, we're getting into some more interesting stuff.<br />I don't mean the soap opera.  Oh, sure, I care about Anita's love life.  What I'm talking about is Hamilton coming up with more than one compelling character.  The scene between Warrick and Anita is menacing...but also oddly touching.  Warrick summoning the butterflies is somehow an image that makes you sad for him, and smile at the same time.  Also, Larry the rookie vampire slayer has picked up some more interesting aspects, namely &quot;Detective Tammy.&quot;<br />This is a strong entry in the series, and a pretty fun read.  Definitely worth taking to the beach or curling up with on a rainy day.	2001-01-03

So I ran it by my psychology professor and a few others.<br />They said the book made sense on one level.  I don't claim to be an expert, but it seems to me to be essentially meditation.  If somebody, especially somebody untrained in the martial arts, is trying to attack you and you remain dead calm, it's probably pretty scary.<br />We also have to factor in the psychosomatic effects.  I'll bet anything that 40% consists of martial artists, and 60% the untrained, or at least those who don't believe in ch'i (I do, by the way.)  The control of the mind over the human body is nothing short of stunning.  Ask to see the feet of a real firewalker if you don't believe me.  There are some who believe that pain and injury are nothing more than the effects of the mind, and that if we didn't think &quot;knives cut&quot;, we wouldn't get cut.<br />Do I doubt people are effected by this art?  No.  What I doubt is the cause.  I honestly don't think our nervous electricity can jump from person to person, except in extreme situations like death or sexual contact.  I think what we've got here is the power of belief, not the power of ch'i.	2000-12-31

But Laurell K. Hamilton keeps me coming back.<br />Part of it is the ongoing plot threads that go from book to book.  Although these novels can stand alone, there are larger threads.  Anita Blake's &quot;romance&quot; with Jean-Claude, the master vampire, for example, or the hints that Anita is something much stronger (and dangerous) than she or anyone else knows.<br />Another part is Anita.  She isn't just a hard rock, lacking any humanity; she's really truly affected by the blood and death she's constantly surrounded by.  She doesn't casually walk up to corpses, she has to compose herself before she looks.  She's not callous, she's just able to hide her horror, fear and sadness better than most people.  We only know because we're in her head.<br />&quot;The Lunatic Cafe&quot; is where the series, in my opinion, REALLY starts to pick up (read the other books &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;, &quot;The Laughing Corpse&quot;, and &quot;Circus Of The Damned&quot; first, it WILL help.)  The soap opera kicks into high gear with a rather twisted little love triangle, not to mention some unfinished business between Anita and a vamp named Gretchen.  Plus we get more of an introduction to the lycanthropes (werebeasts) of the city, their social structure, and the whole host of problems that go with THAT.<br />The novel itself is also pretty good, with the mystery at its center rather clever.  Although she doesn't really play fair (we're not given much in the way of clues to possibly solve this mystery on our own), Hamilton does have a satisfactory solution.  Like the other books so far, it's got a lightning-fast pace; poor Anita NEVER gets any sleep, something always happens to her.<br />This is, in the end, fun junk, great for airports, beaches, and the living room.  They aren't classics, although they'd make great action movies, but the Anita Blake series is worth anoccassional $7 now and again.	2000-12-28

This in of itself would normally be cause for dread; after a recent painful reading experience (Bill Fitzhugh's &quot;The Organ Grinders&quot;, I have a review posted), it's a relief to read a writer who can be political without being, well, annoying about it.<br />It's this very thing that lets Ruff be gut-bustingly funny where other authors tend to fall flat.  Where others just make one side saints and the other side demons, Ruff allows that us liberals aren't the only people capable of being decent human beings.  Of course, a rat is a rat is a rat, and under the surface, Ruff has some rather sharp observations about America, especially when it comes to commerce and race.  <br />But first and foremost, this book is FUNNY.  The &quot;Mr. Science&quot; scene alone, which involves a salami as a high-velocity projectile, is worth the seven bucks.  Toss in Meisterbrau (read the book), Ayn Rand in a lamp, the darker side of Walt Disney, and an industrialist who finds creative sabotage of his enterprises as funny as everyone else, and you've got a great cocktail.  Highly recommended light reading.	2000-12-26

I knew the movie was coming, and it was being praised as a gutsy piece of filmmaking (turns out it wasn't; go to my review of the DVD for more on that.)  So I ordered it from the bookstore of a good friend.  <br />Within two months I'd read it five times.<br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; is a truly rare book, a fast-paced thriller that's also got some very deep points to it, yet is as technically clean and sharp as a laser-cut diamond.  The structure is nothing short of amazing.  Read it a few times and you realize Palahniuk has created a book that's all most perfectly balanced; everything ties into everything else.  As an example; early in the book, Tyler Durden tells our narrator that &quot;a moment is the most you can expect of perfection.&quot;  Later on, this line is repeated, and you realize, for a moment in our protagonist's life, he had perfection and now he's losing it.<br />There are dozens of other examples (this book is a goldmine on how to foreshadow and flashback), and I could go into an analysis of the deeper themes, but I'll spare you the English lecture.  Even if you're not a fan of J.G. Ballard, even if you think you'd be turned off by this book, read it anyway.  You really will not find a better written book from the last decade.	2000-12-24

But if you're considering buying it, why?  Why are you wasting your time and money on something that a high school physics student could refute? I don't claim to have a physics degree, but even I know that if the Earth's magnetic field were weakening, we'd be noticing things a lot scarier and harder to explain than crop circles, like, oh, severe compass malfunctions and widespread effects (such as dieouts and strong disorientation) on wildlife. Also, the First Law of Thermodynamics is not a theory, it is not an generally accepted assumption, it is a scientific law.  Science has yet to find ANYTHING that could even come close to violating it, insofar as I know.  If they run into something that does violate it, we're probably all dead meat anyway (see below.)  If this guy thinks cold fusion isn't around thanks to it violating the First Law, he doesn't understand the process. Cold fusion is, essentially, splitting a water molecule.  It's hard to explain in a thumbnail, and I'm hazy on some points, but it IS a very powerful source of energy, one split could light New York for a day.  It is also very, VERY hard to do, and Thank God.  If some genius discovers cold fusion in his basement, he won't live to tell anybody; the resulting explosion from just a mole of water would probably be enough to take out Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and a good chunk of New York, and although I'm not that good at exponential equations, even with a calculator, I bet anything that's a conservative estimate. Also, basic economics dictate cold fusion is a very good idea.  Why?  Simple.  Do you think any power company will cut its prices just because they can generate more power than the entire human race can use in a lifetime?  Of course not. It's up to your judgement, but in my opinion, a much better way to spend your money is on Feynman's &quot;...Easy Pieces&quot; series, which A) is written by somebody who knows what they're talking about and B)takes something supposedly complex and simplifies it beautifully.	2000-12-23

This comes after &quot;Flood&quot; in the chronology, although I don't think it's necessary to read that novel first (although it too is quite good.)  &quot;Strega&quot; is not a wonder of the English language, but it is razor sharp in terms of characterization and visualization. Vachss doesn't think much of himself as a writer, but here he shows he has chops.  His spare descriptions are vivid.  It should be noted, however, this book is not for the weak of stomach.  It's not gory so much as...you see more of the evil side of humanity in this book than you ever want to in real life, let me put it that way. Not a beach read, but an excellent book.	2000-12-13
US	47778095	R3SD4V3SLCNE8V	0375703764	383727435	House of Leaves	Books	3	3	5	N	N	A conventional thriller, buried under too much artifice	Will Navidson, prize-winning photographer, and his beautiful model wife move in to a seemingly innocent house in suburban Virginia with their two pretty children.  But the house seems to be bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.  Calling in his friend Billy Reston, UVA professor and quadriplegic due to a tragic accident,  the professional explorer Holloway and his team, and his loving bear of a brother, Tom, he braves the freezing dark of a house that wants to destroy them all.<br />Am I describing the new Dean Koontz?  Nope.  What I've just given you is &quot;House Of Leaves&quot; once you scrape off all the crap Danielewski's buried it under.  Not what you thought it was, huh?<br />To be fair, Danielewski is an excellent writer.  He makes a hideously pretentious academic discussion of a documentary (admittedly a highly unconventional one) gripping.  This is a very well-written book, and he has a great future ahead of him.  However, he needs to accept what he is; a thriller writer, not an artist.  The Johnny Truant sections show he can write other kinds of prose, but this is a conventional thriller to the core, and he should own up to it.<br />That I kept reading &quot;House of Leaves&quot; in spite of the artifice slathered on is a testament to just how good a writer he is.  But, along the way, he abuses brackets, decides to switch long S's for F's in one section, and occasionally his stunts even actually work.  There are sections where he's trying to make the text mirror the action happening in it, and these actually work. But did we really need Borges, or at least a Borgesian character, as a narrator (he makes it pretty obvious that's who Zampano is, if you pay attention)?  Did we really need all the quotes of everything from Rilke to the epic of Gilgamesh to child psychologist Jean Piaget?  If his ending and appendices imply what I THINK they're implying, it does make sense, but it's still pretentious on his part.<br />I do recommend this book, but don't be fooled into thinking it's art.  A novelty of a conventional thriller is really all it is.  Hopefully Danielewski will wake up to this, or read his Stephen King and realize that he has some great footsteps he can follow.	2000-12-11
US	47778095	R6H1OW8LZH0UW	0871132109	919538294	A Game for the Living	Books	4	11	13	N	N	A sharp work of mystery	I tend to go for the harder edge of mystery and noir (Andrew Vachss, Chester Himes, etc.), but whenever I can afford it, I buy a new Highsmith novel.  Why?  Because she creates believeable characters and absorbing settings, and her books are more than just the mystery that's a segment (sometimes, as in this case, a small one) of the plot. Unlike the chilling &quot;Cry Of The Owl&quot;, this novel is more about Theodore and Ramon than it is about the murder that it opens with.  This isn't a wild ride, edge-of-your-seat book.  Instead it lures you in by making you care about the characters. Highsmith seems almost to forget about the murder, in fact, and explores these two men, and their relationship, at some depth.  The mystery is paid attention to...but the novel ends on a note that implies maybe it isn't as neat as the characters think. If you're looking for an out-and-out mystery, or a suspense thriller, &quot;The Cry Of The Owl&quot;, an equally good book, is probably more for you.  But if you like psychodrama, definitely pick up &quot;A Game For The Living.&quot;	2000-12-04

Moore's plots aren't the most brilliant, but he's clearly much more interested in character.  Besides, his humor more than makes up for any familiarity in the plot. I wish I could tell you some of the jokes, I really do.  But they'd take some of the fun out of the book, and I can't make myself do it.  Suffice to say this book had me on the floor almost the entire time I was reading it.  Buy this (or any other of Moore's books) for laughs, you won't be disappointed.	2000-12-02

Gym memberships are ridiculously expensive, free weights are relatively cheap but take up a lot of room (I'm in a college dorm.)  Also, weights may build muscle, but it's easy to hurt yourself and the gains are hard to measure.  You can't tell if you've done any work; you hurt too much, even if you've done it right. This book is completely diffferent!  I've been doing the program for one and a half months, and I notice a definite difference.  I haven't added much muscle mass yet, but my body feels much lighter and defter, not to mention looser and more relaxed.  Also, it's much easier to tell when it's working; it feels like your body is doing it of its own accord.  That feeling alone is incredible.  I don't do any form of martial arts, but this work-out is incredible and furthermore much easier to do and stick with.  I recommend it to everyone, not just martial artists. ()	2000-11-04

It's not just suspenseful, it's scary.  The book has aged, but not dated; if anything I found Highsmith's characters even more disturbing in light of how social mores and psychological knowledge has advanced.  But what's ultimately scary about it is that what happens to our hero, Robert Forester, is something that could very easy happen to anyone in the wrong place at the wrong time. Read it, it's brilliant.	2000-10-08
