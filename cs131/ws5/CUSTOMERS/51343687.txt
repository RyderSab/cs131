The Advent of the Postmodern Era	Books	5	5	9	N	N	Book answers the most frequently asked question today	Again and again on the mainstream media we hear the question, \\"What happened to the world we knew just 50 years ago?\\" expressed in variety of ways. Dr. Tiedemann's book gives a thoroughly researched, documented and evaluated answer. Although he provides an answer to this question, Tiedemann does not claim to know \\"all the answers.\\" <br /> <br />Postmodern philosophy teaches that truth is in the mind of the believer. We create our own realities and there we live: If it feels good, it must be okay. \\"The way to peaceful coexistence,\\" he writes in his evaluation of that philosophy, \\"is to learn, as best we can, what each others' realities are in order to understand why people think they way they do.\\" That way lies peace on earth, the postmodernists claim -- we just learn to accept others for who they are and we can all get along. <br /> <br />That, of course, presupposes that the \\"others\\" WANT to get along with us. Bin Laden and al Queada being prime examples of those who hate us because we're not Muslims and would destroy us for that reason only. <br /> <br />The postmodern claim that we should learn to live \\"authentically\\" and \\"in harmony with others\\" presumes, of course, that we are not doing those things to the best of our ability. Postmodernism focuses on the negative in our present and past. Truth does not exist; self-awareness and self-response is our proper focus. <br /> <br />Thus postmodernism shifts our society from its traditional value of building community to the divisive \\"me first\\" ideology. In attacking traditional American values of religion, morality, hard work and self-sacrifice, the postmodernists rail against those values, calling them prudish, bigotry and racist.  <br /> <br />Tiedemann traces the root of postmodern thinking to the Sophists of the 5th Century B.C. and follows it through the French philosophers and Soviet class warfare, presenting its rejection in every age.  <br /> <br />To the American Traditionalist, Tiedemann's warning about thepostmodern attack on Christianity is especially revealing. \\"In postmodern circles,\\" he writes, \\"no single topic on the human condition comes under more vicious, and yet shallow, attack than that of Christianity. Evidence of this stems from the fact that the subject is broached in almost every book on the topic of postmodernism.\\" <br /> <br />Indeed, we see these attacks every day -- from the ACLU lawsuits to court rulings denying Christian expression in every public phase of society. And we keep asking \\"why?\\" <br /> <br />This book clearly defines postmodernism in terms of our everday lives. It shows where it came from, how it developed and the result of it in American society today. It most effectively answers the questions most of us are asking about how we got to where we are today in everyday life in the USA. <br /> <br />Now -- in the interest of literary ethics: I think I've provided a fair overview of the book. It was written by my son; I'm very proud of him.	2005-07-06

The FairTax does all those things and more, repealing the income tax, employee taxes, corporate taxes and more while fully funding the US government. Everyone also gets a monthly rebate so noone pays any tax at all up to the poverty level.  <br /> <br />Fox says the U.S. would have a stronger economy without these provisions. He suggests doing away with all but the most essential special relief provisions, and implementing a simpler tax code that would reduce taxes for all brackets. <br /> <br />If we get rid of the income tax and become the first nation on earth to NOT tax productivity, \\"outsourced\\" jobs return and foreign companies come to America to do business. <br /> <br />Everything John Fox advocates is taken just a step farther with the FairTax.	2005-05-11

Even if you already know and support the FairTax, this book is a must-read.  <br /> <br />First it describes how the FairTax came about, a question that comes up often in discussions! This is no fly-by proposal. On the contrary, it is the result of a 10-year study by major economists from universities like Stanford, Harvard, Rice, MIT, and more. The book names names: Who paid for the study and why, what they're doing now and what they plan to do. <br /> <br />Americans for Fair Taxation has a lot of information on their website but this book has even more. Here you'll find a collection of articles, charts (rebate calculations,comparisions of all kinds, estimates, costs, etc.), letters, studies and results. <br /> <br />There's a great chapter on the \\"Impact of the FairTax on Interest Rates\\" that will make everyone sit up and take notice, <br /> <br />There are sections on how the FairTax will impact businesses like home builders, financial services, mining, oil and gas, and more -- even timber-related industries! <br /> <br />Most amusing and delightful is \\"The Twelve Days of a FairTax Christmas\\" beginning on page 56 and written by a FairTax staff writer.  <br /> <br />FairTax, by giving every worker his/her entire paycheck, makes every day Christmas Day. <br /> <br />In short, this book tells the reader who needs the FairTax and why, who are the people behind it, what the experts say about it, gives the impact of the FairTax on the economy and various organizations and businesses and chronicles the history of hearings already held on the subject. <br /> <br />If you think you know all there is to know about the FairTax, this book will prove to you that you don't. <br /> <br />If you don't know anything about FairTax (and if you're a taxpayer you owe it to yourself and your family to find out), this is a reliable, complete source of information.	2005-04-28

It's been a while since literary fantasy appealed to me, even if I did force myself to read some Harry Potter books just to see what all the fuss was about. <br /> <br />How I came upon Five People and happened to read it is a story in itself so we won't go into that- it's enough to say that, with a sigh, I sat down to read it. <br /> <br />And couldn't put it down.  <br /> <br />Scattered throughout this charming explanation for what life is truly all about are amazing insights into personalities and events. This is a book for everyone and whether or not the reader agrees with the various philosophies and musings, it would be hard to come away without having stumbled upon something new to think about. Even something profound! <br /> <br />If you're not much of a reader the simplicity of the story and the language should appeal to you. If you're somewhat prejudiced against stories that pretend to interpret the deepest secrets of the most spiritual and invisible things,  you'll still enjoy this if you can just open up your mind and let the story in.	2005-03-16

It clears up a lot; explains exactly why the Democrats lost the elections both in 2000 and 2004. It also demonstrates the amazing patronizing attitude of pseudo-intellectual \\"liberals\\" who can't seem to open their eyes and see what is going on around them. <br /> <br />It's so easy to decide you're right about everything and that anyone who disagrees with you is stupid. It keeps you blind to reality and makes you totally incapable of dealing with reality. Kansans aren't blue collar illiterates (although we do have a few among us -- the ones I know are Democrats).   <br /> <br />Liberals need to wake up and see the truth. The country has heard their message and moved on. As long as they insist on rationalizing their defeat with this kind of blind prejudice they'll continue to be losers.	2004-12-17

Wolff, a prize-winning art critic, is an artist as well as anart lecturer, writer and judge. <br />Controversy could understandably be a synonym for modern art, especially abstractionist art. By 1950, abstractionism had become the dominant force in the art world, partly because of the influence of the likes of Peggy Guggenheim who had more money than taste, knowledge or morals. Guggenheim used her inexhaustible supply of money to promote artists whom she liked for personal reasons that had little to do with their talent or abilities -- at least artistic abilities. This influence led to prominence. Prominence led to contempt -- for traditionalists and those who dared to criticize abstract art.<br />In this atmosphere of prejudice and suspicion strides Wolff with this collection of intelligent and witty articles. He is motivated, he tells us, by concern about the &quot;cavalier manner in which entire categories of artists were...not recognized as serious creative figures.&quot;<br />&quot;To prefer one kind of art over another is one thing,&quot; Wolff writes, &quot;but then to condemn the rest is to make a mockery out of art.&quot;<br />Artists essayed here are varied: from Munch, Mondrian, Roualt and Klee to Warhol, O'Keefe, Cezanne, Homer and Matisse. There's even an essay by Wolff on a charcoal by Wolff. MASKS is a passionate and learned voice expressing with a lyric charm a very personal and individual appreciation of an eclectic assortment of artistic works.<br />Find a copy and put it in your permanent collection.

She learned her craft by writing thrillers for tabloids while working as a domestic in wealthy households.<br />Louisa Alcott never intended for these pages to be read so reading them is an extremely personal experience. The reader gains an intimate insight into the life and mind of one of America's premiere 19th century women writers. Louisa was a poor speller, we learn, and we also learn how she felt about abolition, the Civil War, educational reform, women's rights and many other issues including arguments she had with her editors.<br />Reading JOURNALS was an intense experience that transported me into her time and her life. If you grew up reading LITTLE WOMEN and LITTLE MEN you'll thoroughly enjoy this look at a remarkable author's life.	2004-06-06

Brzezinski was director of the National Security Council during the Carter administration so few could write with more authority on the subject of communism in the 20th Century.<br />First he gives detailed background information on the unraveling of the Soviet empire. Beginning with Lenin's concentration of political control and the use of terror, Brzezinski traces Stalin's total consolidation of power through elimination of rivals and the subjugation of peasantry. Although interrupted by World War II, these tactics were revived in Eastern Europe during the postwar period. Stagnation set in, however, and the systme failed to deliver the promised social and economic improvements.<br />After Stalin's death, his repressive regime decayed to a corrupton-dominated state under Breshnev, interrupted only by abortive reform movements during Khrushchev's tenure. By the mid-1980s most top Soviet leaders accepted the need for renewal and began to debate how these reforms were to be accomplished.<br />Brzezinski details emerging unrest, beginning in Poland, and discusses China's &quot;commercial&quot; communism. The events he describes confirm the seriousness of the now often disclaimed Cold War threat and helps the reader to understand what happened, how it happened and what it all means to us today.	2004-06-06

The first clue is in the basic premise of mystery fiction. Speaking, as it does, of such basic matters as life and death, quest and query, fear and the unknown, the detective novel assumes that the puzzles of life can and will be solved. The reader turns from the ordinariness of life to the author's promise that around each corner lurks the possibility of menace, that conspiracy fills the air, that we have every right to be paranoid, but in spite of it all, everything will turn out all right.<br />Another clue: Reading mystery fiction provides us with a harmless and vicarious way of releasing our homicidal instincts, says Lehman, allowing us to murder again and again without having to suffer the consequences. Thus, he concludes, reading mysteries leads us away from performing the act of murder.<br />&quot;Our love of mystery is matched only by our longing for certainty,&quot; he writes. &quot;and because we find it hard to tolerate the condition of doubt and guilt in shich we are destined to live.&quot;<br />Lehman's love of mysteries and his eagerness to share favorite books and characters lends charm and emphasizes his major points. A chronological bibliography is included and divided into related genres, critical documents and resource books. That proves to be a banquet of delicious additional reading on the subject. Another delight is his review of 15 of his favorite mystery novels.<br />Read this one to gain new insight and a deeper appreciation for the mystery genre.	2004-06-06

And it's definitely one that's entertaining and interesting enough to warrant re-publication.<br />It's about a rare and distant world -- a world where movie stars were glamorous and remote, held high on pedestals and expected to be more beautiful, more exciting and much, much more exotic that everyday folks. They were seen as always perfectly coiffed and smiling, loved and treasured, surrounded by adoring sycophants.<br />Back then movies were larger-than-life stories that had little to do with actual living and a lot to do with romantic (even sentimental) entertainment. Movie makers seemed to be having as good a time making movies as audiences had watching them. And according to this book, they were! It was a win/win world.<br />The volume is divided into three chapters: \\"The Stars,\\" \\"The Buildup,\\" \\"The Movies,\\" \\"The Studio\\" and \\"Behind the Scenes'\\" reprinting highlights of magazine coverage of the movie industry from 1935 to 1972 (when sex and violence took over and people who loved movies for entertainment quite going to theaters). <br />It's fair to say the book is a mirror of the successes and failure of both Life magazine and movies. It's a fabulous collection of romance and romantics. If you remember the Old Hollywood, this book is for you.	2004-05-24

By that I mean her words conjure mental pictures of characters and scenes in the reader's mind. The setting she writes about in ISLANDS (the coastal South) is beloved and familiar to me. She has the ability to create a charming world for the reader that is a delight to experience.<br />All that said, although I enjoyed reading ISLANDS, I felt the story was weak. The ending seemed dux ex machina and the characters were too familiar to avoid the feeling that they were cliches.<br />She's still my favorite author and I'll read every book she writes, but ISLANDS strikes me as a book written by someone who no longer has anything to say. Ms. Siddons has lived in her world so long and written it so well that it's time to stretch her talent with something new.	2004-05-24

THE ART OF FLORENCE does full justice to its subject -- and it's a lot cheaper than plane fare to Italy.<br />The last time I was in Italy I witnessed three muggings, one in the Church of Santa Maria Novella, and those experiences were so unnerving that I couldn't fully concentrate on the loveliness of the many treasures before me. I barely remember any of them. So what a delight to discover so many of them in stunning full-color plates, to be enjoyed again and again in the comfort and safety of my own home.<br />The dual volume book is divided into historical sections of about a generation each in length. Each begins with a lucid account of the history of the city during that period with emphasis on the political, social and economic events that influenced the patronage of art at that time. There are separate accounts of the architecture, sculpute and painting done in each period. A rich and exciting interplay unfolds between the arts, the politics and the social structure of each time period. No wonder Florence was the artistic and political leader for all of Europe during the 13th through 16th centuries.<br />The authors confine themselves to Florentine artists or those who lived for some time in Florence. References to other artists, when necessary, are minimal. Michaelangelo, for instance, is discussed only in terms of the Dona Madonna, since it is the only painting of his in the city. His limning of the Sistine Chapel in Rome is mentioned only in passing.<br />These two volumes are special -- so special they'll draw you to the reading chair even when the siren of Spring calls through your window.	2004-05-24

There's more to the book, however, because it's a book about women who grew up believing they would find their Prince and live happily ever after someday -- and didn't.<br />Whether the bride did or not remains a matter of conjecture, although the impression here is that Grace Kelly Rainier's married life really wasn't all that terrific after all.<br />The book is opinionated to the point of being offensive. The author solves problems and gives advice to all who would listen. Her voice is strident but her story is compelling.

Neal Gabler claims that Adolph Zukor (Paramount), the Warner brothers, Harry Cohn (Columbia Pictures) and the moguls of Fox Studios, MGM and Universal had a dream of what America was which they incorporated into movies and sold to the American public and the world.<br />Gabler claims that what these movies showed was not the real country at all. &quot;Only this way,&quot; he writes, &quot;could these immigrants satidsfy their hunger of assimilation into a country that had rejected them.&quot; In the end, he says, the fictive America created by these businessmen portrays an artificial &quot;reality&quot; that later generations of moviegoers took as truth.<br />I have two problems with the premise of this book: First, I know for a fact that the America portrayed in the movies of the '40s and '50s did exist and second, those moguls created their own social world, partly out of geographic necessity and partly because the work of filmmaking isolated them from the everyday work world. <br />I know the kind of family, community and lifestyle often portrayed in those &quot;romantic&quot; and &quot;sentimental&quot; movies (i.e. where family members and members of the community worked and lived together in mutual respect and affection) existed because I experienced it. The movies I saw as a child and as a young adult in the 1940s and 1950s mirrored the life I knew. <br />I understand that contemporary life is so different from life in those days that young people view what they call &quot;sentimental romanticism&quot; with disbelief. I pity them. The lives they seem to be living look shabby and disgusting to me!<br />It's an interesting premise but it's built on a false presumption! <br />The book will charm the moviephile. It's entertaining and well written and it gives a fascinating look at backstage Hollywood in a time when Hollywood enjoyed a great deal more respect than it does today.	2004-05-24

MIRACLE is a specialty book for a special audience. It's the story of the building of the nation's performing arts center in Washington D.C., from President Eisenhower's signing of the Sept. 2, 1958 legislation authorizing a national cultural center to its opening in 1971. It's a story of trial and triumph, of bitter controversy and rivalry, of failure and success.<br />In 1789 George Washington directed Pierre L'Enfant to design the Federal City as &quot;a cultural and civic center of the United States.&quot; National civic matters dominated immediately but culture lagged behind. (Not a new state of affairs!) As distinctive American music, theater and dance developed, however, the need for a national performance hall became more and more obvious and slowly gained recognition.<br />In the years between 1958 and 1971, General Counsel Ralph Becker was intimately involved in the development of the center. This is his story as well as the center's, for he was not only instrumental in helping solve the problems but his influence and leadership provided a guiding light for the project, which often floundered on the shoals of bureaucracy, tossed on the storms of red tape.<br />From the beginning there was opposition, sometimes quite powerful, to building a national culture center. Many argued that government had no business dabbling in the arts. Even supporters disagreed among themselves. There were arguments and disputes among builders, politicians, developers and civic leaders. Some didn't like the site on the Potomac, some objected to the design, others objected to the materials and still others argued about the cost. That bugaboo of progress, funding, stood on its back legs and roared.<br />Presidents formed committees and commissions. Congressmen wrote bills. Senators debated, citizens lobbied. Just about the only thing about the center that everyone agreed on was the name. After November 22, 1963, everyone who was anyone agreed that the name should be changed from the National Cultural Center for the Arts to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.<br />Black and white photographs grace these pages. There are pictures of the building under construction and photos of the pols and performers who've graced the grand occasions at the Center since First Night.<br />If you love the hall as much as I (and it's SO much more than a performance hall) you'll find this an absorbing story. Some of the facts and figures are a little dry but it's a testimony to the persistence and dedication of those who were determined to make it happen.<br />If you're not familiar with the center, you will be after you read this book. After all, it's yours.	2004-05-24

The character of Brummel is quite consistent; he's unable to take anything seriously except himself and how he presents himself to society. Vain, self-centered, proud and so shallow that he is almost shocking, Beau Brummel is the most pretentious and self-righteous character we've seen in a long time. He's also sensitive and thoughtful of others; traits that round out his character. And it's this character that makes the book so charming.<br />The story is totally forgettable -- this is a character-driven tale set against a charming, historic background. You could read a lot into it as an indictment of society if you want to stretch a bit, but it's much too much fun to spoil with such seriousness. If you're in the mood to be entertained, this is the book for you.	2004-03-23

That's high praise. <br />Jacques Pepin's life in kitchens, beginning with his mother's cafes and continuing on the Food Channel, is a fast-moving and sometimes surprising journey. As a child he worked on a farm (sent there by his parents to avoid the bombs of WWII) but it's his experiences in his mother's cafes that confirms his culinary talent and hitches his wagon to international stardom in cuisine.<br />Entertaining and international, this is a book that should bring more admirers to Pepin's already crowded table.	2004-03-12

Hesser, a food writer for the New York Times (All The News That Fits, We Print) tells the story of a courtship, with recipes. If you're in the mood for simple, sweet entertainment, this book will fill the bill.<br />The tale hangs on entertaining and feeding her fiancé-to-be-and- eventually-husband and friends. It's light, amusing and charming but the recipes are best of all. Unlike a lot of books like this, they are delicious and really work. I especially recommend her Roquefort Balls and Chocolate Dump-It Cake.	2004-03-12

It's also a rare picture of a lifestyle that was as glamorous as it was unenviable. <br />I loved the language of this book. It's written the way upper class people talked in the early 20th Century -- that slightly formal English that seems to have fallen by the wayside in the age of sloppy grammatical constructions like &quot;looking to&quot; (as in \\"she's looking to marry\\") or \\"I was, like\\" (as in \\"I was, like, really angry\\") or the appalling lack of appropriate pronoun use in much modern writing (\\"He handed copies to her and I\\").    <br />Like the lady she was, she has written a careful account of the people she knew, the places she went and the things she did, but has equally carefully omitted the highly personal details that modern autobiographies pretend to give their readers. When she expresses her dismay at being forced to marry a man she didn't love, she's quite cool about it all. That's the way ladies were back then. She had lovers (as did most of her social crowd) but she doesn't elaborate. She would have been appalled at the modern \\"tell all\\" kind of books we're used to seeing.<br />One of the outstanding things about this book is the view of a woman who did not put herself and her ambitions above everything else. The desire to marry a peer of the British realm seems to have been her Mother's, not hers, and the fact that she went along with it and made the best of the situation for such a long time illustrates a huge difference between the era she lived in and ours.<br />The book is a charming voyage into a social age -- different and yet in some ways not-so-different -- from the one we experience. It will provide the reader with an inside look into a specific social history along with glimpses of a life of riches, glamour and high adventure.	2004-02-13

When I was laid up with the first of three surgeries on my foot (unable to even put my foot on the ground for six weeks for each surgery) I was panicked because it caught me in the midst of a highly successful weight loss program. That program, however, required exercise in addition to restricting calories and carbs. Someone told me that the South Beach diet would work even if I couldn't exercise. That didn't sound plausible to me but what the heck, it's not as if I had any choice.<br />So I tried it. <br />It works. <br />I continued to lose weight even though I couldn't do more than hop on one foot, using walker or crutches, and I spent most of my time in a wheelchair or in bed.<br />Kudos to the South Beach Diet! <br />The nutrition is sound and some of the recipes are utterly scrumptious -- notably the Shrimp Louis, the Gazpacho, and the Balsamic Chicken. I can't stand fish (other than shellfish) so it was a bit of a challenge to avoid those recipes but I did it and enjoyed the chicken and beef recipes immensely. I also discovered that toasted, unsalted almonds or a low-fat cheese stick make a great snack and there's a lot to be said for an apple and a tablespoon of peanut butter (neither of which do I like separately).  <br />Once you learn to eat this way, it's really easy (although the first three days would have been challenging if I wasn't flat on my back). <br />I wholeheartedly recommend South Beach Diet to those who can't, for one reason or another, exercise.	2004-02-09

As a rather jaded reader of murder mysteries for more years than I care to count, I thought I'd read them all. When I picked up YOU'VE GOT MURDER, I expected a trite tale of Internet stalker/murderer. Boy, was I surprised.<br />The sleuth in this fast-paced and thoroughly original tale is a computer. This is no ordinary computer, however. This computer is endowed with a name and with charm, personality and sensitivity; a computer who takes pride in her work and continues to learn and improve. When she misses her programmer and suspects that something has happened to him, she sets out to find him. Now this is no simple task for a machine -- a collection of chips, bytes and bits! As the story evolves the reader hangs on every page to see just how this delightful machine will manage to get legs, eyes and ears and solve the evolving, increasingly complicated puzzle. <br />This is a delightful and absorbing story full of charming, believable characters. So what if the villains are a bit of a cliché?  The analytical processes of the computer heroine, the rest of the characters, and the story are so imaginative and original that the book is a real page-turner. We can only hope that this is the first of a series.	2004-01-26

The likeness is found in the characters and their stories more than the setting, however. In Steel Magnolias the core of the action is the beauty parlor; that setting is mentioned only superficially in House of Curl. As a matter of fact, the beauty shop is featured only in the title.<br />To continue the comparison, in Steel Magnolias the tragedy is central to the story; in House of Curl it's a subplot, almost an afterthought. The most important difference in the two books, however, is that in Steel Magnolias, each character is affected by the success or pain of the others; but in House the characters seem separate from each other.<br />House of Curl is a relaxing read, perfect for those days when you just want to spaz out with a book. Curl up by the fire on a snowy day or settle into a beach chair by the sea and be entertained for an hour or so.	2004-01-25

Those few of us who have wondered why in the world a comfortable, cosseted American girl would want to marry an Englishman and live in a cold climate in an even colder stone castle will find answers here, even if the answers aren't satisfactory to the modern ear.<br />Think of it: wealthy American society girls, products of generations of men and women who gave lives and fortunes to escape a Royalist society, thought it a worthy investment of their lives, loves and wealth to buy an English title in the form of a husband. It's understandable that men who have no money and are saddled with huge estates and titles with no way to support themselves \\"in the manner to which they have become accustomed\\" would search out these women. It's another matter to understand the women, especially if they were bright and energetic (like the fabled Jenny Jerome).<br />Of course the first women to get involved in this weird method of social climbing didn't realize what was involved. (Though why American society decided that an English title was important in the United States, especially if it could be bought with money, still escapes me.) The problems included loveless husbands who paid little attention to their wives and carried on affairs; cold and drafty castles into which Papa sank tons of money to no avail as far as comfort was concerned; families who refused to accept them in spite (or because) of the fact that they provided the money to keep the lifestyle intact; servants who often were sulky and rebellious (\\"but we've ALWAYS done it that way\\"); children they handed over to nannies. The first brides must have kept the hardships and loneliness from the succeeding generation, for the rage for English titles prevailed from the mid-19th century almost through the mid-20th century.<br />TO MARRY AN ENGLISH LORD is a fascinating and complete look at these women and the lives they led. Illustrations showing the homes and households of the times and how they operated, fashions, maps, photographs of the women and their friends, families and husbands all combine to present the core of that particular section of society in that particular age.<br />The book is meticulously researched and includes a bibliography, a register of American heiresses, a suggested walking tour of the women's London and a very handy index. It's built around the stories of these women and the men who wooed and won them. Who they were, what they did and what the consequences were -- all adds up to an intriguing and fascinating read.	2004-01-18

I was rather prepared to dislike this book after reading Publisher's Weekly put-downs and Amazon's sheep-like follow-ups but soldiered on to see what all the fuss was about -- and loved A Weekend at Blenheim! I thought the premise (that the dukedom itself might be in question) delightful, the suspense artful, the characters delightfully deceitful (and so typical of the British upperclass) and overall, the book one of the most entertaining and enthralling I've come upon in a long time.<br />I'm so glad I didn't let carping like PW's \\"overengineered\\" and \\"improbable\\" stop me. (DUH -- this is fiction!) And this holier-than-thou statement: \\"More than a few readers may find it in dubious taste that Morrisey ascribes some monstrous behavior to the Duke and Duchess who, after all, were real people\\" overlooks the fact that the monstrous behavior referred to (affairs and rudeness to others) were a documented part of their lives as it was the lives of others of their class.<br />The book is a page-turner; with real-life characters doing fictional but all-too-real things. The story is fabulous, beautifully timed, calculatingly told and a thoroughly delightful read. The slightly formal language of the book is that of Edwardian England, which adds a certain charm to the reading experience. Phooey on the nay-sayers. This one's a keeper!	2003-08-22

Swain was one of the finest writing instructors of his generation -- right up there with John Gardner -- and many who were fortunate enough to study with him went on to publication.<br />Bickham went on not only to publish many science fiction and western stories and books but to teach writing, continuing in the fine tradition of his mentor. This is not the only book he has published with Writer's Digest Books, but it's one of the best. In fact, for novice and published pro alike, it's one of the finest books on writing extant.<br />Too many amateur writers reject the notion that stories and books are constructed. They expect to sit down and write for an hour -- an evening at the most -- and produce The Great American Short Story. But writing doesn't work that way and Bickham has done a fine job of organizing the muse and showing the writer just how to pull the most out of his creativity.<br />WRITING THE SHORT STORY is a program geared to lead the writer through inspiration to publication. Acknowledging at the beginning that published works today SEEM to lack form, he proceeds to show just how much form a story must have. By definition the short story has a &quot;beginning, a middle and an end&quot; and here Bickham provides a story roadmap practically guaranteed to produce a publishable finished work.<br />Writing isn't easy. At least it's not if you want to be published. The writer has to know him/herself and must know the markets and the competition equally well. All that learned, s/he must proceed to understand the structure of the story as well as the importance of characters and characterization. Then there's how setting and mood affect the story. And more...from the story map to marketing, and it's all here.<br />Follow the assignments in the book and you'll learn. I don't care how often you've been published or what you've published -- there are lessons to be learned here.<br />In all, I'd say this is one of the finest books on writing in print. Any writer who studies Dwight Swain's books and Jack Bickham's books and follows their directions with practice and persistence WILL be published.o be learned here.<br />In all, I'd say this is one of the finest books on writing in print.

This one is far more ranging in subject matter. Here a variety of published authors speak out with authority on an equally varied number of aspects of writing.<br />Eileen Workman's \\"Ten Commandments For Successful Plotting\\" includes the \\"Cardinal Sin of Plotting\\" and presents solutions to the problem of plot development in a succinct and useful nutshell. \\"Five Mistakes Beginning Writers Make and How To Avoid Them\\" by Gwenneth Barnes addresses several concerns that often surprise the novice. Marcia Kiser's example of how to map a mystery takes the ouch out of outlining and John Moir describes the importance of narrative arcs in nonfiction. Books used in researching pieces are listed in a \\"further reading\\" section at the end of the article. <br />Pieces on Genre Writing: Memoirs, Historical Novels, Mysteries, the Short Story, Creative Nonfiction are examples of the range of advice and short cuts covered in these articles.<br />The inquisitive writer, even the most experienced one, will undoubtedly find surprises and new insights here. From taking the slack out of your writing to the use of setting to indicate character, and from addressing writer's block to \\"I Is Not Me,\\" I challenge anyone to read this book and, when finished, to tell me he or she has not encountered some new concept.<br />THE BEST OF NOVEL ADVICE is novel (meaning unique) and contains some of the finest advice for writers that you'll find between two covers.

It's a Harper Audio.<br />The only time I usually listen to books on tape is when I'm driving long distances. I tend to stop by a Cracker Barrel and rent something that fits my mood at the time. That's how I came to listen to this book.<br />I chose \\"Coastliners\\" without recognizing the author as the person who write \\"Chocolat\\" (which I read and loved) and without having heard of the book. It looked long and I was going to drive a long time...........<br />When Mado returns to the village of her childhood after the death of her mother, she finds nothing but decay and a somnolent citizenry. Her father, who has always been noncommunicative to the max, is even more withdrawn and secretive than before she left to live in Paris with her mother, who has recently died. Mado is convinced that he loves her sister more than she and becomes more and more convinced each time her sister appears on the scene. Meanwhile, the energetic Mado discovers a way to bring touristry and profit to the island while losing her heart to Flynn, a mysterious stranger.<br />The reader, Ms. Benesch, does a capable job but I found her pronounciation of French names and phrases to be terribly distracting and at times even confusing. I am familiar with French and I think that if I was confused, someone who has no knowledge of the language would get terribly lost. The story, though, is riveting and the characters, if somewhat predictable, are fascinating.<br />I think I'd have enjoyed this much more if I had read it instead of listening to it.	2003-02-17

It's an imaginative story with characters who seem like people you might run into at church, at the country club or at the grocery store...folks you've seen here and there and maybe wondered about the lives they're living.<br />When Skip Cuddy, handyman/gardener on the Blessings estate, decides to keep a foundling he finds quite literally on his doorstep, he discovers more about life and about himself than he could ever have imagined.<br />As the story develops, Quinlen deftly interweaves past and present, all the while painting memorable word pictures of settings and individuals. The reader must pay close attention as memories flow -- Lydia Blessing, who is 80+, shares the protagonist role with Skip.  Through her the reader participates in the natural flow of an aging mind. These parts of the story are quite skillfully done; and are clearly recognizable to someone who is familiar with the elderly.<br />The writer's use of language is delightful. I get so tired of choppy, incomplete sentences in modern novels. Quinlen's writing is not only intelligent, but gloriously descriptive. The story becomes a delightful dream that unfolds in the imagination.<br />The ending is not one I would have chosen, but I did have the impression that there's more to be written about these characters, especially little Faith and Jenny and Skip. Whatever happens to Skip in the rest of his life, the lessons he has learned during the course of the events in the book have changed him and he will create a future for himself that is far better than he would have had if little Faith had not come into his life.<br />Anna Quinlen is an immensely talented writer. I'm looking forward to reading her other books and I'll certainly eagerly await the next one.	2003-02-03

The first two times I never made it past the first page before I lost interest. QUENTINS kept my attention all the way through. I found the characters realistic and the stories riveting. I think I'll go back to the others and try again after enjoying this one so much.<br />I did find one thing that kept distracting me. The writing bounces around like a fishing boat in a stormy sea. It's choppy -- almost as if a copyreader went through and put periods after a certain number of words in each sentence. There is an amazing number of incomplete sentences in this book. It occurred to me to wonder if, since Binchey is a British writer, the text was &quot;dumbed down&quot; for Americans. I sure would like to test my theory by reading the novel as it was published in the UK.<br />The central story, although thoroughly predictable, is a riveting one. You'll figure out the ending before you reach the middle but you'll keep reading to see how she works it all out. Binchey is a great storyteller.	2003-02-02

It's a tough and thankless job whether you're a Mom or a nanny. This book turns out to be an indictment of both.<br />I find it difficult to be amused at disfunctional characters like a workaholic, philandering father and a self-centered, shallow mother and a self-martyred, victimized nanny. <br />Do people really lead shallow lives like these? I suppose they do somewhere but I don't think this picture is typical. The wealthy people I know have a serious sense of responsibility to their families and their communities. Their servants are treated with respect and paid well. <br />Certainly lives in busy, productive and relatively happy families have enough real conflict and drama to produce an interesting book without resorting to this kind of melodrama. And certainly no self-respecting nanny would stoop to the shabby behavior &quot;Nan&quot; does at the end of this book no matter how &quot;put upon&quot; she felt.<br />Maybe someday someone will write a memoir about &quot;nannying&quot; that's less prone to sensationalism than this one.	2003-01-15

I'm so old that I remember when Cable TV promised to give commercial-free programming in return for the customer's subscription fee. That seemed like a great idea and I've often wondered why -- and how -- it disappeared so quickly. Batten's book certainly answers that question. <br />This book, which could use some careful editing and does not speak well for current literary standards at the Harvard Business School Press, tells a fascinating story of the building of a little empire. Batten's insights on leadership are intriguing, too, and he certainly doesn't hesitate to point out areas where he feels he could have done better. All of that will be helpful to the reader who wants to learn about building a business from &quot;scratch.&quot; <br />It's encouraging to see how the weather channel has evolved. We can hope they'll soon improve on some of their current shortcomings. One I find particularly annoying, for example, is &quot;your local weather&quot; &quot;on the 8s&quot; which never has my local weather but instead gives me the weather in Chicago, Atlanta, Boston and other major geographic points -- a ridiculous time-waster, at the very least, to someone deep in the Nebraska woods! More useful would be a temperature map of the regions surrounding those areas. <br />The subtitle: &quot;The Improbable Rise of A Media Phenomenon&quot; is a bit misleading. I can't imagine how such an idea -- that is, the idea of presenting nationwide and even worldwide current weather on television -- could possibly NOT have occurred to someone once satellite images were available. The improbability, it seems to me, was that noone would come up with the idea.<br />But media phenomenon it is and although the book isn't a phenomenon, it is an intriguing look at building a modern business and should be especially useful to budding entrepreneurs.	2002-10-22

The subject is classic -- a woman going through a mid-life crisis and seeking to &quot;find&quot; herself. The middle-aged woman, of course, has a much better chance at finding someone when she searches herself than a younger one. We create ourselves, day-by-day, whether we are aware of it or not, and a search too soon is a fruitless one.<br />That said, Anderson &quot;finds&quot; what she's searching for and she expresses both the search and the discovery (which, actually, takes her back where she started in the first place)in delightfully descriptive and easy prose.<br />The reader won't find any earthshaking &quot;truths&quot; here. Indeed, it's doubtful that such &quot;truths&quot; even exists -- but he or she will find a charming and delightful experience of a year by the sea in Cape Cod.

I wanted something to help me break out of what I felt was my reviewer's rut. I've been reviewing books for almost 20 years and find that I tend to look at each much the same way. This little volume has helped me out of that rut and into some useful and original thinking about the books I'm reading.<br />Although admonitions like, &quot;jot down the book's strengths and weaknesses&quot; and &quot;write down questions that arise&quot; were nothing new to me, thinking of putting myself into the life of a character in fiction or considering what I'd ask the author of a nonfiction book if he or she came by for a visit caught my attention along with several other extremely useful suggestions.<br />By the time I've read 25 books and noted my reactions to them according to these guidelines I'm sure I'll have broadened my perspectives considerably as far as book reviewing is concerned. As for deepening my pleasure in reading, it's hard to imagine but it is possible!<br />Natalie Goldberg, who is familiar to most writers as a superb teacher and mentor (WRITING DOWN THE BONES, THUNDER AND LIGHTNING, and LIVING COLOR), says in her introduction, &quot;This journal gives the reader the opportunity to have double pleasure like a double latte: Not only do you get to read the book, but then you get to savor the taste, roll it around in your mouth, and feel its complete flavor.&quot; <br />That has always been the pleasure that reviewers discover as they ply their craft. Now, thanks to Robin Doak, the pleasure is available to everyone.	2002-09-27

The reader is drawn into the world of minor British aristocracy and is treated to characters who, although somewhat eccentric at times, seem much like people we know: Parents are well-intentioned if somewhat misled, children are willful and spoiled. Life, however, is frivolous and carefree in an increasingly dangerous and threatening world. It's easy to understand where Nancy got her sense of humor and her ability to write social satire -- it was bred into the bone.<br />It's also understandable (and not at all uncommon) that the older siblings found some measure of success while the younger ones behaved like the over-indulged, spoiled children they were and never seemed to cease to be. <br />The reader who remembers (and the student of) the early- and mid-20th century will recognize the famous names that wander through these pages with the infamous family: Aly Khan, Winston Churchill, Katharine Graham, Diana Cooper, Evelyn Waugh and more -- it's a star-studded group of friends, relatives and acquaintances that touch and often seriously influence the lives of the Mitfords.<br />I loved this book. The story is fascinating and almost surreal as it unfolds through the girls' schooling, debutante years and various adult exploits played against the backdrop of the developing World War and its aftermath. Lovell has done a superb job of presenting the zeigeist of their era and their lives in a readable and entertaining text.	2002-09-18

I didn't expect it, either, because this isn't a textbook. It's just a beautifully written, new concept on journaling.<br />&quot;Keeping a journal is one of the few ways to remind oneself of life's unnoticed gifts,&quot; she writes, and gives exercises to stretch the writer into finding those gifts. In the chapter &quot;Finding the Through Line in Life: Memoir and Fiction,&quot; she says the journalist unconsciously tries to find the meaning of life and shows how to detect it in your own writing.<br />I do recommend it to both the new diarist and the experienced one.

Her mind plants the living experience in a kiss on the hand and flings it to her audience like affectionate royalty waving to an attentive crowd. <br />She was born in Hamburg, Germany and the \\"Curriculum Vitae\\" poem in this volume beautifully articulates her immigration to the United States and her life here.

Illustrations by Robert Moser, original wood carvings commissioned for this work, are sometimes macabre, always different. Much of the art work borders on the repulsive and the words aren't particularly unusual -- I found only 3 I didn't know and zugzwang was one of them.<br />But their histories are fascinating and, after all, that's what the book is about.

It sat around here for a couple of years before I read it; the title turned me off. What could possibly be interesting about the hair of the man who created some of the most powerful, affecting and effective music ever written?<br />However, the tale of what happened to a lock of Beethoven's hair, severed from his head the day after his death by a 15-year-old boy, is a story of honor, love, courage, hope, friendship, man's inhumanity to man, and man's triumph over the worst kinds of adversity. It's also a picture of how 20th century technology can penetrate secrets of the ages.<br />Martin interweaves several diverse narratives with a biography of Beethoven's health rather than one of his entire life because it's his health that is the issue here. The question involves what we can learn about the terrible physical suffering Beethoven endured from DNA testing of his hair. This question is posed against the background of what happened to the sample from the time of Beethoven's death until it reached the laboratory. The first is familiar; the second is amazing.<br />Martin treats his material with a sure hand, weaving the stories in and out as he takes us back and forth between the centuries and the characters. I found that I was holding my breath while reading about how the Danes helped the Jews as the Nazis breathed down their collective throats.<br />This is an amazing and unusual story, told with intelligence and finesse. It's not a book to be skimmed; if you do, it will look disjointed and you'll become confused. It's a book to be reveled in and thoughtfully digested. If you crave perfection, play a CD of Beethoven's last quartets while you read.	2002-08-23

Her ambitious mother Agnes has, however, thought a lot about it. She has a banker's son lined up to marry Billie. As daughters will, though, Billie has other ideas. She falls in love with a handsome Navy pilot, Moss Coleman, and marries him instead. Shortly after the wedding, Moss is shipped off to war. He sends Billie and her mother to his home in Texas.<br />If you're a fan of Danielle Steele, you'll love this book. It's a rollicking good tale, full of romance and adventure -- Texas style. The story spans the eras between WWII and Vietnam and covers 4 generations of the Coleman family. <br />Moss's father is obsessed with building a dynasty. Billie's mother will sacrifice anything, including her daughter, to secure her position in the Coleman family. Billie loves Moss with all her heart.<br />Sexual passages were too explicit for my taste but the narrative moves at a good clip and there's a variety of interesting characters who are well developed.<br />TEXAS RICH is pure entertainment and fine escapist fare.	2002-08-23

It's not supposed to be a motivational book but I started a fitness regime after reading it!<br />Sabol has been a \\"fitness freak\\" most of her adult life. As health columnist for Mademoiselle magazine, she traveled widely, reporting on (and trying out) all kinds of spas, resorts, diets, exercise parlors -- you name it, she tried it.<br />Here she tells all. What it's like to be coddled, starved and exercised at places like \\"The Golden Door\\" and other expensive and exclusive watering places for the elite, what it's like at Gold's Gym and Santa Monica Body Builders. (The prevalence of the word \\"gold\\" in the titles indicate what clients give and owners get. With these clients, the most obese things in sight are the costs of the programs and the bank accounts of the customers.)<br />\\"Aerobics and fitness in general,\\" Sabol writes, \\"did not just become a fashion -- they became a craze. And it was the craziness that became injurious to the health movement...What we need to do is rethink our definition of fitness...The most important question is fit for why? What is the point of looking like an Olympian if you're a clerk at the A&P express line?\\"<br />Sabol contends that the drive for fitness can be a narcissistic way to avoid relationships, a substitute for things that really count. We need to understand our limitations and be aware of needs and objectives. \\"Acknowledging that our basic fears of aging and of intimacy led us to the extreme physical self-obsession.\\"<br />She adds,\\"Good health means being keyed into the ultimate balance of life for you and you alone. But above all, we must learn to heed the advice of our own body wisdom. In the end, that's the only trainer worth sweating for.\\"<br />This book makes more sense than anything else I've ever read on the subject.

I never would have chosen this book, but it showed up in my mail and, well, what else is there to do but read it?

This made Belize the first country in the world to protect jaguars.&quot; <br />This book tells an utterly fantastic tale -- sometimes terrifying -- of how that came to be. It portrays a world most safely enjoyed from the comfort of an armchair; a very personal story that is a combination of natural history and hair-raising adventure in the Stanley Livingston tradition.	2002-08-21

William Harmon, professor of English at the University of North Carolina has revised and updated this handbook, long popular in academia. He's added more than 100 entries which reflect current trends in literature and criticism. <br />If you don't have a student at home, get this book anyway. Read it. Just the outline of English and American literary history in the back of the book is worth the price. You undoubtedly will find books here you never knew existed. I thought I'd read all of Eudora Welty, for instance, but I found a &quot;new&quot; title listed here -- new to me, at least. I also discovered a James Gould Cozzens book I'd never heard of.<br />The handbook is actually an encyclopedia of words and phrases pertaining to the study of literature.

When the 50th anniversary of the publication of GONE WITH THE WIND (henceforth referenced as GWTW) occurred in 1986, Harwell published this volume of letters from Margaret Mitchell Marsh. Gleaned from a collection of over 50,000 letters, clippings and notes covering a variety of subjects, these letters give us insight into the author of GWTW and her world.<br />Marsh argues with her publisher about issues like the name of the heroine and the title of the book, which she had originally titled TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY. She had named Scarlett \\"Pansy\\" in her original manuscript. When controversy arises over her description of the desecration of Confederate cemetaries by Federal troops, she reveals her sources of information as well as her surprise that the question should come up at all! <br />Adventures and misadventures with the filming of the book (rumors that she would cast the film caused wild complications in her life), the fame that makes her so uncomfortable, problems concerning the writing, publication and success of GWTW -- all combine to make this an unusual and utterly fascinating picture of one of America's foremost writers.<br />Mitchell had what she called \\"a passionate desire for personal privacy.\\" That passion shows in these letters, along with a touch of Scarlett O'Hara and a smidgen of Melanie Wilkes. GWTW devotees (and possibly those who aren't fans, too) will enjoy this glimpse of the double-edged sword of success and its effect on Margaret Mitchell Marsh.	2002-08-21

My first sunflower house failed but I tried again and was rewarded with a delightful garden retreat. I had no idea flowers could be so high -- and so sturdy. Then I tried the flower clock and that was an immense success. The rainbow garden worked, too, and by that time I was running out of space. I've never considered myself much of a gardener; certainly everything I try to grow indoors curls up its leaves in abject rejection and withers away! But the projects here worked for me.<br />This little book is great reading, too. I didn't want to try the Giant's Garden but it sure was fun reading about it. Imagine the largest tomato -- a 6 lbs 8 oz \\"Delicious\\" -- or a pumpkin big enough to ride in. The \\"Cinderella\\" pumpkin has reached 500 lbs. \\"Some people pick off all but one ear of corn or one pumpkin,\\" Lovejoy writes, \\"in order to allow all the growth to go to one, special vegetable.\\"<br />She has a good word for bugs,\\"Hosting a healthy population of these friendly critters can make your garden a thriving, pest-free environment.\\"<br />Plant a kinder-garden, she suggests, and lists plants whose names match each letter: A for aster, B for bachelor's buttons, C for cockscomb, D for daisy......all the way to Z for zinnia.<br />There's a garden of greens and a butterfly garden and there are faeries and sand castles and even secret notes to be found. In all I'd say this is a book for anyone who's willing to let go a little and enjoy the outdoors in new and luscious ways.	2002-08-19

Just what do they think politics is all about, anyway? And have they never seen attorneys in court -- and afterwards? Do they not realize that men in the 18th century were human beings just like the rest of us? <br />Simon continues the contemporary revisionist Jefferson-bashing by perpetuating the now-debunked Hemings story, which lowers his credibility. Jefferson and Marshall are portrayed as politicians as they were. Both were attorneys and Jefferson, at least, knew exactly the kind of power Marshall was after. That made him a formidable opponent.<br />But the most interesting thing about this book to me is its conclusion, which I believe to be seriously flawed. Simon says that Marshall succeeded in defeating Jefferson's states rights concept when what he really did was to establish a more equal balance between the judicial, executive and legislative branches of government.<br />The outcome (or, rather, the inevitable outcome had it been totally played out) of the recent election is a case in point. According to Constitutional law, had the combatants -- Bush and Gore -- decided to continue the process, the election would have been thrown back into the Florida state legislature (indeed, that's where the Supreme Court sent it because of the Constitution), where it would have been decided. That's States Rights, folks. Jefferson's States Rights. That's why Gore quit when he did -- the Florida legislature was heavily Republican, therefore the proverbial handwriting was on the vertical surface. Had Florida not been able to choose, the matter would have gone on to Congress. The powers are beautifully balanced but the point is that the Supreme Court was and is not the final arbiter. I'm sure Marshall would have preferred it to be otherwise and it might have been so if it were not for Jefferson.<br />So to say that Marshall, who admittedly won a number of skirmishes, actually won the war is debatable and, I hope, will be explored with prejudice for the other side of the argument in another book by another author someday.<br />But the critic must give the author his material, so WHAT KIND OF NATION is a delightfully readable compilation of some fascinating material on one of the critical debates (or, more accurately, jockeying for power) that necessarily occurred during the birth pains of our nation. The fact that the principals didn't like each other personally lends color to the presentation of the material. <br />The source notes in the back of the book are extremely useful for the reader who prefers to check the context of various quotations and even conclusions.	2002-08-11

His feuds with Callas and Sills made headlines (all greatly overpublicized, he says).<br />In KNIGHT AT THE OPERA, Bing describes the problems and surprises he encountered in running the Met. His recollections are surprising and fascinating as he portrays the personalities and the organization from a unique perspective. Successes and disasters, performers and critics, composers and conductors -- all are seen there through Bing's sometimes passionate, always interesting and always biased point of view.<br />Bing was instrumental in persuading artist Marc Chagall (who painted the mural on the ceiling of the Paris Opera) to design the sets and costumes for Mozart's &quot;Magic Flute,&quot; one of the first operas performed when the Met opened its new house. Chagall accepted the challenge and helped create an unforgettable production of Mozart's last opera.<br />The history of the Metropolitan Opera under Bing is like the performances produced on its stage: comedy is so light, tragedy so dark, and everything seems to happen at once. This book is an absorbing look at the staging of an era -- full of egos and personalities and stories that could only be told by the man who scored it all.	2002-08-09

Churchill said about books, for example: &quot;If you cannot read all your books, at any rate handle, or as it were, fondle them -- peer into them, let them fall open where they will, read from the first sentence that arrests the eye, set them back on the shelves with your own hands, arrange them on your own plan so that you at least know where they are.

Medical records could be either in an individual person's file or filed by month, depending on whim. The problem, I discovered through reading this book, is in analysis. First you figure out what doesn't work and why, then you create a plan that works. It's all very individualized and sensible.<br />I've read lots of books on getting organized and they all impose their own system. This one teaches the reader to evaluate his/her own situation, including psychological resistance to getting organized, then goes on to suggest several solutions. I found tips on staying motivated particularly helpful since I had a mammoth chore ahead of me when I started.<br />The concept of containerizing is also especially useful in a rather large household. Things certainly stay neater now!<br />I do recommend this book to anyone who suspects that life could be a little better organized and flow just a little smoother.	2002-08-08

That's what this book is all about, and it's full of really superb advice.<br />&quot;If you love, you're considered naive,&quot; Buscaglia writes. &quot;If happy, you're considered frivolous (or, in this reviewer's experience, no one believes you) and simple. If trusting, you're considered a fool. If you try to be all those things, people think you're a phony.&quot; Boy, that's calling it as it is!<br />Emphasizing the importance of good communications in relationships, Buscaglia stresses the need for honesty and truth. &quot;Only truth,&quot; he writes, &quot; can bring us the necessary trust needed for long-lasting relationships. Only truth, painful though it may sometimes be, can create a safe environment of unity and growth.&quot;<br />Understanding the dynamics of forgiveness is crucial to those who care about lasting relationships. He discusses loving each other in joy, in intimacy and the challenge of developing trusting relationships. Friendship is an expression of deep regard for another.<br />In a friendship, each affirms the other and reinforces his or her dignity with respect and affection. &quot;As the friendship becomes deeper,&quot; he writes, &quot;it becomes a sharing of vulnerabilities in a safe environment. We let each other know that our becoming is of the utmost interest and concern. We show in action that we respect and admire one another, that we enjoy the opportunity to be together and share experiences.&quot; <br />There's little in life that is as comfortable, rewarding and fulfilling as a long-term, totally trusting relationship based on respect and love. Following the concepts presented in this book makes developing that kind of relationship a little easier than trying to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; by doing it on your own.	2002-08-08

It's a matter of life or death. This book covers subjects like parasitic infestation (yes <shudder>, it's possible), flatulence and digestive problems, constipation and bowel conditions, and even colon cleansing procedures. <br />Jordan says the increase in cancer rates along with our polluted environment and the additives in our food all make colon cleansing -- indeed, system cleansing -- crucial to our individual health. <br />Twelve medical doctors support her theories of detoxification and there are illustrations, cartoons and diagrams to emphasize points.<br />This really is an important book, especially if you're \\"of an age,\\" for as we get older, taking extra precautions for our health becomes more and more important.	2002-08-01

As he should! He stresses self-understanding, determining communication goals, building a positive perspective, choosing words carefully and the &quot;art of caring communication.&quot;<br />One truly important thing that he points out is &quot;ambivalence on the part of the parent is likely to be interpreted as license by the teenager.&quot;  He suggests that rigidity is definitely not the alternative, but a clear committment to a system of values. Example is far more effective than preaching. &quot;Do what you say. Teens are quick to spot hypocrisy.&quot;<br />This book is a last minute fix for parents who haven't been working on communication with their children and, frankly, I don't know if it would work or not. Crucial to teen trust and communication is consistent interest from early childhood -- parents who not only instruct but LISTEN from the time the child begins to talk. It takes years and it takes effort...lots of effort. <br />If you have a teenager and you don't know how to say &quot;no,&quot; you're in trouble. Swets does, however, describe techniques to establish that authority. He also calls for improving your listening skills and gives feedback techniques to use when you disagree. You'll find graphs and charts for getting to know your teen -- and yourself -- better.<br />There's lots of helpful information here but the time to begin to talk to your teenager is long before adolescence!	2002-08-01

Frankly, I was disappointed. Although the story was fairly interesting and moved at a satisfying pace, the actions of many of the characters and especially the protagonist, Cassie Ringwald, just didn't ring true. A professional psychologist, for example, would be bound by ethics not to discuss a case with anyone -- much less discuss it as casually as she does in this story. Especially alarming is the fact that the author is a clinical psychologist! <br />It was also stretching a bit to define this story as a &quot;cozy.&quot; Most of the characters -- especially the skinheads -- are not the kind of people readers would be interested in knowing, which defies Martin's own definition of the rules for the contest. The &quot;cozy&quot; mystery usually creates just that atmosphere; this book certainly doesn't. The beginning and end of the book is set in a garbage dump -- rather a far cry from the Vicar's study or the library in a country house!	2002-08-01

New perspectives (at least new when the book was published in 1970) and shocking statistics changed our view of Indian-White relations in the 19th Century. Characters speak for themselves in quotes from Presidents, Chiefs, generals, braves and cavalry troops.<br />In one chapter the reader is invited to a Cheyenne winter camp to observe their preparation for the hard season. Then, before dawn the next morning, we are led to watch in horror as Lt. Col. George Custer leads a cavalry charge on the village. Of course there is nothing here of the actions that prompted such malevolent response, but that would not serve the purpose of the book. For the purpose of this book is totally one-sided -- to portray one side of the American Indian experience and to cast them in a much more sympathetic light had been done in previous writings. The book is pure, narrowly-focused historic revisionism with no pretense toward balance.<br />All that said, it's a valuable book because for us to understand our heritage, we need to know about and be sympathetic to, the truth of our history, whether it strikes us as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; What looks bad to us in the 21st Century may not have looked that way to us had we lived in the 19th and known only what they knew.<br />This book gives us some of the truth and it should be read and appreciated for what it is rather than lauded as the final word on Indian-White political relations. Let's hope that someday someone will have the courage to write &quot;the other side of the story.&quot; And, folks, there IS another side that is equally poignant and equally valuable.	2002-07-30

If I knew how it was going to end, I probably would not continue on.&quot; Robert Heinlein says,&quot;The most important lesson in the writing trade is that any manuscript is improved if you cut away the fat.&quot; And Andre Gide: &quot;Never present ideas except in terms of temperaments and characters.&quot;<br />Both experienced and novice writers will find this useful IF they don't just look at it and put it aside.

How in the world any publisher thought for one moment that someone who couldn't write that phrase could do justice to the sequel to GWTW, is beyond me. And Ripley doesn't. The characters are shallow pretenses of the originals, the story is more cheap paperback romance than the original and the entire effort is one, sad joke.<br />Ripley claims she read GWTW six times (be still, my heart -- most of us fans read it more than that before we were out of college) and she outlined it, studied the language (??? she isn't even a Southerner?), and \\"even\\" copied 200 pages to get the feel of it.

In this 1914 period piece, sometime infielder Mickey Rawlings hopes his NY Giants will beat the Dodgers and earn a shot at the World Series. There's a movie crew shooting the game and right next to the Dodger's dugout, Mickey sees the luscious and famous movie star, Florence Hampton. When the director asks for a man from each team as bit players, the Dodgers pick Casey Stengel and the Giants choose Mickey.  <BR> <BR>The Giants lose the game (and baseball fans and non fans alike will appreciate Soos's short and vivid game descriptions), the glamorous Miss Hampton whisks Rawlings and Stengel away to film some scenes, then they're off to a champagne party.  The next morning Mickey takes his hangover for a walk on the beach and finds Hampton's bloated body washed up on the beach. His friend, journalist Karl Landfors, talks him into investigating Hampton's death.  <BR> <BR>Soos's  simple, almost journalistic prose holds the reader captive in the early 20th century baseball world. Soos, a physicist at MIT, says he always liked \\"reading mysteries and doing physics mostly for the puzzle...I think Peter Lovesey's Cribb & Thackery series is what got me writing historicals.\\" <br />He uses books, film and photos to learn how the cities looked  in the early part of the century. \\"I do use actual incidents and players, then I start to play the game of `what if?' to tie them together in a mystery plot.\\"<br />Although I'm a baseball fan, I don't consider myself a fan of historical baseball -- at least I wasn't until I discovered Soos's series.

His buddy, rookie Willie Kaiser, tormented by fans and teammates, becomes moody and morose and Mickey worries about him. Meanwhile someone begins a campaign of harassment against the team.  He releases smoke bombs, saws bleacher seats so they collapse, and puts pretzels at all concessions stands so the team is vilified in the press for being pro-German.  To cap it all off, someone reduces Mickey to cold showers by stealing his hot water heater.<BR> <BR>When Charles Weeghmann, builder of the field and President of the Cubs, suspects William Wrigley is the saboteur because he wants to take over the tea, he asks Mickey to investigate. Then, in the midst of the on-field 4th of July celebration, Willie Kaiser dies of a gunshot wound.<BR> <BR>If Soos intends to portray the tenor of the times as well as to present a Q story as intriguing as Bobby Thompson's home run, and a character as irresistible as a beer and hot dog (and I'm sure he does),I'd say he's batting at least .450.  <BR> <BR>The appealing and resourceful Mickey probes at the very source of America's neuroses at a time when the music of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven is banned, the director of the Boston Symphony jailed for playing German music, German-Americans are being lynched, and even innocent Dachshunds and German shepherds neglected or killed. But the world will right itself again, and even professional baseball survives the turmoil. <br />Soos's characters are fully developed and intriguing. His portrait of an earlier America in the throes of war hysteria says a lot to us today. We can take the warning to heart. There are no lectures here, though, just a rousing good tale.	2002-07-25

In my mind I see the row of farmer's dilapidated trucks parked alongside with their wooden boxes of fruits and vegetables fresh from the mountain truck farms -- bright green spinach and crisp green beans, sunny yellow squash and crimson strawberries.<br />He mentions Cherokee Hills and I remember Cherokee Boulevard in Sequoyah Hills, where I grew up. At his reference to the S&W Cafeteria I think of Lois Harris playing the organ there on Thursday nights, and the Disney cartoons they showed for the children after dinner.<br />So this book is really two books for me. Mauro speaks of Knoxville of the 1980s and 1990s and makes me remember the Knoxville from 1940s to 1970s. So how could I not like the book?<br />Krutch Park didn't exist when I lived there, but I was born on Clinch Avenue at Fort Sanders Hospital. He mentions Highland Avenue and I remember that James Agee lived there even before my time and in the 1960s Hollywood came to town to make a movie of his book, DEATH IN THE FAMILY, starring Robert Preston.<br />I think this is the first time I've ever seen a book I could barely read for the memories it prompts. I'm amused by the story of a young couple haunted by questions about a past they could never know -- 1952. It was that year and near that place when my date and I were returning to the parking lot from a movie at the Tennessee Theater one warm summer night and heard a woman scream. Could it have been...???<br />The World's Fair, the YMCA, the Bijou Theater, Gay and State Streets -- places in these stories that revive more memories from the Knoxville I knew.<br />Needless to say, reading this delightful look at contemporary Knoxville was not only a joy from the average reader's point of view, it was a trip into nostalgia. Mauro captures the new city and yet is able, at the same time, to retrieve the old for those who knew it.<br />Like Jack Mauro, my husband was born in New Jersey and fell in love with Knoxville when he came there as a young graduate student at UT. There is something magic about that place, and Mauro has done a fine job of putting some of that magic on the page. <br />Ruth Fulton Tiedemann	2002-07-24

The mummies do, indeed, dance as Thomas Hoving takes on the Park Service to expand the museum, wiggles around UNESCO and fights a host of governments for his favorite works of art, plays one collection against another, trades, deals and bluffs his way toward making the Metropolitan Museum of Art what it is today.<br />Hoving has a steam-roller personality, the energy of nuclear fission and no small amount of self-confidence. His educational background -- Princeton and an archeological expedition or two in Europe -- isn't as impressive as you'd expect, but he makes up any shortcomings with old-fashioned chutzpah. <br />After some experience in minor jobs and a city job with the Parks Department, he's told he may be selected as director of the Metropolitan so he looks the place over and makes some notes: \\"The museum needs reform. Sprucing up. Dynamics. Electricity. The place is moribund. Gray. It's dying. The morale of staff is low. The energy seems to have vanished. You've been missing all the fine exhibits....\\"<br />This book shows how MOMA gets from where it was then to what it is now -- the politics, infighting, backbiting, sneaking, smuggling and downright stealing it takes to make a museum one of the finest in the world. It's also a fairly realistic look at the glittering personalities and the haute monde of the New York City of a few decades ago.<br />This is a rousing tale that should hold the interest of any reader, art lover or no. Never mind that Hoving doesn't hesitate to toot his own horn. This is, after all, his book. Even taking the stories with a massive grain of salt, they're always riveting and vastly amusing. No one will ever say of Thomas Hoving that he has no opinion on the people and the issues of the art world or that he hesitates to express them.<br />I can't imagine anyone not being fascinated by this marvelous picture of the fabulous and often sham world of art museums and the people who support them and run them.	2002-07-23

I picked it up because of her name -- Fulton is a family name -- and it turns out it's a stage name so we're not kin.<br />Oddly enough, the book interests me because it's about a world that I find artificial and unappealing, and it certainly confirms my original opinion. Building a career as a stage actress, soap star and nightclub performer (she's also a singer) isn't easy and Eileen Fulton has worked hard to achieve her success. She is content with her successful career and her personal life, although husbands and lovers don't stay around for long. It is her career that she values above all, and that's what she has at the end of the book. It reminds me of an old popular song that Vaughn Monroe used to sing: &quot;Dance ballerina, dance...and never mind the seat that's empty in the second row....&quot;<br />The book reads like most other star autobiographies -- artificial, like it's written by a professional trying to sound like an amateur. I'd guess that it's ghost written, probably by the same person who wrote Lee Iaccoca's book. It is entertaining, though, and I'm sure it's a valid look at a life dedicated to theater and television.	2002-07-23

I was disappointed: There's little of Klein's actual childhood here. It's more about the lives of children of movie stars than about her own experiences. In fact, in what she does mention of herself, I get the impression that she's apologizing.<br />I wish my friend had written this book. His stories of growing up in Beverly Hills were personal and fun; hers seem to have been gleaned from newspaper stories and scandal sheets. <br />That said, GROWING UP SPOILED IN BEVERLY HILLS looks very much like growing up spoiled in Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, New York or just about anywhere else. Children of moneyed families become successful and relatively happy adults in direct proportion to the amount of loving care and attention they have received from parents throughout childhood.	2002-07-23

Wearing his writing hat, he has published bestselling novels like THE HUSBAND and THE MAGICIAN and OTHER PEOPLE as well as books and computer software on the craft of writing. He has tipped his editing hat to such prominent authors as James Baldwin, Elia Kazan and Jack Higgins. He has sported his teaching hat at Columbia, Iowa and the University of California at Irvine. Sol Stein is a man who knows what he's talking about when he talks about writing,<BR> <BR>In HOW TO GROW A NOVEL, Stein presents some illuminating information for the fiction author.  He intends to \\"write a book in which I could deal with the most important recurrent problems in the same depth as I would in an extended meeting with an individual author.\\" And so he does.<BR> <BR>The book is divided into two sections: The Responsibilities of the Writer and The Responsibilities of the Publisher. The appendix has two additional sections under the label of Practical Matters: The Little Things that Damage the Writer's Authority (on the use of dialect, on binding manuscript pages, for example, and how long your book should be) and Where Writers Get Help (in this chapter he promotes his own books and computer programs, but he does mention others).<BR> <BR>In Responsibilities of the Writer, Stein says that the reader of fiction is looking for \\"an experience different from his or her everyday experiences in life.\\" It's not that the reader doesn't welcome insight and information, but it's the experience of the story that keeps him or her glued to the page. Stein's objective \\"is to help novelists perfect their skill in making the reader turn pages, to forget that he is reading, to live among characters that once resided only in the writer's head and now seem true and memorable to strangers.\\"<BR> <BR>The time to consider the reader's experience - that is, the effect that each scene sequence will have on the reader -- is not when you are writing a book but when you are planning it. In a series of questions and answers he demonstrates just how to do that using examples from his own work and from works he has edited.<BR> <BR>Stein discusses the necessity for conflict and demonstrates that conflict may not necessarily be violent, but it is the very essence of dramatic action. In the manuscripts he sees, he writes, \\"the fault is seldom too much conflict.\\" So he goes on to show just how to create an adversarial sense in order to keep the reader on edge of expectation.<BR> <BR>Another responsibility of the writer is to capture the reader, to create a \\"love at first sight\\" kind of experience. The beginning must grab her, glue her to the page and the rest of the book must not let go until the very end. The use of surprise, the building of tension, the use of detail to clarify and intensify, twisting a plot point into something else - he illustrates each suggestion with an example from his own work or something he has edited.<BR> <BR>Stein emphasizes the importance of building realistic characters, yet his approach is a little different. One suggestion he makes: If you are struggling with a flat character, he says, take a look in his pocket (or, presumably, her purse). Find something that would surprise him/her greatly. Then answer the questions he poses.<BR> <BR>Finding plots, creating dialogue, the best point of view, writing with honesty and focus - all of these are areas where the writer has a responsibility to the reader and Stein gives new insight into how to achieve them in fiction. He attacks specifics in revision. Removing redundancies and author intrusion, eliminating melodrama and extra words and phrases, replacing cliché \\"beats\\" with small, appropriate actions, changing events that are \\"told\\" into active scenes are just some of the problems he illustrates. <br />\\"The function of an editor,\\" he writes, \\"is to help a writer achieve the writer's intentions.\\" The many suggestions and exercises in this book should do exactly that, whether his reader is a published author or novice writer. It's stunning to discover that the single most common mistake that Stein has seen, \\"including the work of professionals,\\" is words, sentences and paragraphs out of order.<br />For the nonfiction writer there's an entire chapter on \\"Fundamentals for Emigrants from Nonfiction\\" that will shortcut a long road that might otherwise by a trial-and-error one full of pitfalls. The 70 or so tips certainly shortcut the process of revising fiction.<br />I must admit that I have avoided Sol Stein's works because of a past experience with his crass commercialism in promoting his software for writers. However I can say, without reservation, that HOW TO GROW A NOVEL is a truly useful and enlightening book for every writer, whatever her level of experience.	2002-07-22

We're not talking serious literary criticism here but we are talking about serious book reviewing. In the introduction, Kamerman describes what makes a good book reviewer and how to get started. She tells how to approach the material, the importance of knowing the audience and gives the fundamentals of preparing and writing the review.<br />In the first essay, Robert Kirsch talks about the importance of conveying to the reader what the book is about - READ the book, he admonishes. That isn't as superfluous as it sounds - some reviewers don't. He suggests ways to respond to the book and describes the importance of knowing your own value system when you're judging. He gives a sample review, too, and discusses it.<br />The essay on the structure of a book review is particularly helpful. Begin with a hook or a blunt, compressed summary of the argument or with some startling detail or outrageous exaggeration, P. Albert Duhamel says. The body of the review includes what the reviewer likes and doesn't like about the book - the kind of material (fiction, nonfiction) affects how this is handled and he goes into some detail about handling specific situations. One important point - don't ask your readers to substitute your opinions or value judgments for the author's. He also points out that the reviewer must judge the book, not the author.<br />The difference between reviewing fiction and nonfiction, taboos in reviewing, reviewing books for children, reviewing mysteries, writing for the regional book section as opposed to the weekly book review section, reviewing at the local level, and paying the reviewer's dues are just some of the subjects studied by professional reviewers like Doris Grumbach, William McPherson and Jan Frazer. Barry Bricklin even covers \\"Reviewing For Specialized Journals.\\"<br />This truly is a \\"guide to writing book reviews - by leading book editors, critics and reviewers\\" that should be beside every book reviewer's computer. It is comprehensive and the thoughtful reader/reviewer will get something new from it with each perusal.	2002-07-19

Older women are disempowered and she asks who benefits from this displacement of power.<br />\\"Ageism, not aging, oppresses us,\\" Copper writes. \\"We are oppressed by other women and we oppress ourselves.\\" Copper accuses the women's movement as well as professionals who provide services for the elderly. She says the effect of making decisions for them and \\"servicing\\" their needs renders old people powerless. Ageism can be defeated only by naming it, resisting it and redefining our understanding of it. Growing old must become accepted and celebrated instead of feared and rejected.	2002-07-19

If you're in one of those, don't turn up your nose at this one! In it Oates has captured the style of the 19th Century Gothic Romance novel down the the last crossed t and dotted i. It's also a beautifully researched picture of how women lived in the late-1800s, written in the language of the time -- or at least a very good simulation of it. 20th century feminism in 19th century guise.<br />It's about women's roles in society and the rules they lived by. A fast-moving tale full of imaginative twists -- there's a wedding night scene that's the funniest and the most surprising I've read.<br />The story begins with the introduction to a surly Cinderella-type with step sisters who definitely are not Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. It's September, 1879. All five girls are spoiled and privileged, living lives of ease in the white-columned splendor of Kiddemaster Hall, near the Bloodsmoor River in Pennsylvania.<br />The girls are relaxing in the gazebo after a grueling party. Deirdre (did they really name girls Deirdre in those days?), who is our Cinderella, becomes angry and stalks down the path to the river. Suddenly a giant black balloon dips from the sky and carries her away. The book describes the fates of the girls for the next 20 years in rich and lively prose.<br />Oates takes the romance novel and skewers it with social satire. Her volume of work is prodigious -- she has probably written more in a wider variety of style and genres than any other contemporary author. Whether romance, horror, science fiction, mainstream, mystery, short story collection, essays, criticism or poetry, her work excels. Joyce Carol Oates is the Renaissance Woman on the modern American literary scene and A BLOODSMOOR ROMANCE eclipses the genre.	2002-07-19

Jr. League cookbooks have come a long way since the first little spiral-bound paper products of some 40 or 50 years ago. I don't know if the Atlanta Jr. League was the first to come up with the cookbook moneymaker project, but I do know their cookbooks have been much respected over the years -- venerated, even.<br />In this one, though, they've outdone themselves. Even if the recipes were awful (and they're not), there's still enough entertainment in this book to make it worthy of the price. And that's not counting the gorgeous illustrations that place it firmly in coffeetable display status.<br />It's the stories by famous Georgia writers that kick this volume into the stratosphere of pleasure.  <BR>     Ferrol Sams's double-take as he watches Katie Couric brave a glass of horse's milk on the Today Show, for example, is bound to split a stitch or two. <BR>     Then there's the late Lewis Grizzard on his prowess at the grill. \\"I come from a long line of outdoor grillers,\\" he says, \\"My Uncle Jerome still holds the American record for consecutive days grilling out, 178.\\" <BR>     Reconstructed Yankee Bill Diehl holds forth on how he came to love the South. He quotes his mentor, Ralph Gill of the Atlanta Constitution, &quot;We must work to make a better North, South, West or New England, because in so doing we make a better America.&quot;<BR>     The inimitable Anne Rivers Siddons holds forth on the difficulties of finding a bowl of real Southern grits while on book tour in the great Fly-Over Land. <BR>     Stuart Woods, Eugenia Price, and Valerie Richards Jackson are just a few of the star-studded literary lights who shine in these pages. What a great idea to showcase Georgia's finest literary talents along with its best culinary talents!<br />I'll vouch for the recipes, too. I've been married to a full-fledged (and also reconstructed) Yankee for more years that you can count on all the digits of several people and when his side of the family came to visit recently, of course they expected Southern food from the only bona-fide Southerner in the family. So I served Crème Fraiche Biscuits with Chevre and Country Ham Butter, Spicy Grits Casserole and German Pancake with Peach Compote when they converged on me for a reunion brunch. They loved the food, asked for recipes and when I showed them the cookbook, they enthused over that, too!<br />Every recipe I've tried from TRUE GRITS has been delicious and has garnered raves from my family and friends. Therefore, I can unequivocally give it the highest recommendation from a cook's point of view as well as from one who values -- indeed, treasures -- a good read.	2002-07-18

The editor is patterned on the notorious and terrific Jim Townsend of Atlanta Magazine, where Siddons worked in the '60s and the staff members she worked with then show up with personalities slightly skewed. It's obvious to the reader that every bit of the material here is close to Siddons's heart.

For what it is, this little volume is the best: An illustrated guide (necessarily succinct because it is, after all, only one volume) to authors, works, characters, cities and towns of the British Isles as they relate to literature.<br />If you're putting together a tour of Britain relating to a particular writer -- A Christmas Tour of Dickens's England, for example -- here's the place to begin.<br />Altogether there are 1200 places listed, associated with 913 authors. Illustrations include portraits of writers, pictures of buildings and pictures of landscapes that are associated with authors and their works.<br />The section on Edinburgh is typical. After a paragraph about the early history of the town, its famous writers are listed with titles of their works. the earliest is Gavin Douglas, allegorical poet, who died in 1522. There's information about all the classical Scots -- even the somewhat obscure -- from Dr. Johnson through Stevenson, Carlyle, Burns and MacKenzie to David Hume.<br />It's too small to be detailed in the information it presents, but it's certainly broad enough in scope to be an extremely valuable desk reference to English literature. As a travel guide it's unique and invaluable.<br />It's an extraordinary book, one you'll lose yourself in, one that will send you back to the bookshelf to check and to reread some authors.	2002-07-17

Each lady has a distinct personality and set of worrying problems to work through with or without the help of the others.<br />On one level, that of entertainment, the book rates higher than 3 stars. But I lost interest in it about halfway through -- I did read the whole thing --  because it was too predictable and the characters lost credibility. <br />It's a rare book today where women don't express their independence by going along with society's contemporary views of morality. These women do exactly that -- and much too easily for women of their time and place. I wondered if this is really the way Medlicott wrote the book or if a lot of it wasn't changed by suggestions from a younger editor. I can just see the argument: \\"Modern readers won't accept...\\" <br />Don't get me wrong, now, the characters do struggle, but with the wrong problems. They agonize over trivialities. I'm of this generation of women as are most of my friends, and we're Southerners, too. This just doesn't ring true.<br />Joan Medlicott and Jan Karon must be America's answer to Rosamunde Pilcher and Maeve Binchy. However, Pilcher's books are spectacular in their warmth and sensitivity. They celebrate independent women who unashamedly value home life and family. She seems to have found the balance that eludes the others.	2002-07-16

He has seen the devastation of their work on his own beloved St. Simons Island, Georgia. It is the subject that always brings out his soap box and he does it mighty justice in HOOLIGANS.<BR> <BR>Jake Kilmer, of the Federal Racket Squad, is shocked when he returns to Dunetown after a 20-year absence. Here, \\"..a dark, romantic two-lane blacktop, an archway of magnolias dripping with Spanish moss, that meandered from Duneway to the sea...\\" has become \\"...a six-lane highway that slashed between an infinity of garish streetlights like a scar.\\"  The Norman Rockwell painting is now a Christo travesty in neon. <BR> <BR>To worsen the pot, someone is diligently engaged in offing the local Mob.  Then there's Kilmer's arch enemy, Turk Nance, and Kilmer's obsession with the woman he had loved and lost. As the story advances, interspersed with portions of a soldier's diary of Nam war experiences, tension mounts and the situation becomes ever more mysterious and dangerous.<br />If you've read any of William Diehl's books you know you've found another winner. Vivid prose and spirited characters intent on their mission pulls the reader into a riveting story that moves and twists faster than lightning between storm clouds. Saddle up a Diehl book and hang on -- you're in for the ride of your life.	2002-07-16

William Diehl was a gunner on a B-17 (or B-24?) during WWII, flying over France and Germany. He was shot down and rescued by the French underground so he definitely writes from both experience and imagination in this book.<br />This, my favorite Diehl novel, is set in the churning years of World War II. Originally published with the title \\"27,\\" it's out now under \\"The Hunt.\\" <br />Master disguise artist/actor Johann Ingersoll is commissioned by Hitler to destroy the defenses of the United States.  The plot is lethal, relentless, ruthless and already in motion -- the scope and details of the mission known only to someone known as \\"27\\"...<BR>Diehl is a master at creating villains that can hold their own among the most heinous in literature. Johann Ingersoll is the cruelest, most insidious and most romantic of them all...  If you liked Aaron Stampler (in PRIMAL FEAR, etc.), you'll shudder at Johann Ingersoll...<BR>Read a book by William Diehl and come away stunned by his power and energy. It's like riding a twister--you'll sail high, fast, wide and land hard. But if you treasure the best in writing and in story telling, and love to watch a skillful wordsmith at work weaving unforgettable characters into storylines swift and deep, you'll love every moment.

It's free association designed to call the subconcious into creative action. It works. It's the modern and scientific adaptation of a technique Dorothea Brande wrote about in the 1930s in BECOMING A WRITER.<br />Most writers like to watch their words appear on paper -- or on the computer screen. Then we read them to see what we think. I call it writing from the heart; Rico calls it right brain activity. Whatever you call it, it works, it's useful and learning to use it can change your writing -- for the better -- forever.<br />No serious writer should be without this book, no matter what he/she writes.

But Joan's illness is more serious than anyone has thought.<br />This is not one of my favorite books, but it is entertaining. Characters are well-developed and the story moves along quite nicely.

Diehl wields his eloquent pen like some mighty Zeus, flinging lightning thoughts that breathe and words that singe. His books are not for the timid. It's hard to realize that a mind so bright and playful creates such iniquitous villains.<br />When legendary attorney Martin Vail is forced by his political enemies to defend Stampler with his invincible legal team--a retired judge, an ex-boxer investigator and a gorgeous psychiatrist, Vail sets out to prove Stampler not guilty.  He strides toward his goal, bending with each unexpected blow, through a plot as complicated as a biblical genealogy and infinitely more intriguing--until he comes to a shattering ending.<br />Diehl's writing is so vibrant that his books are not for the squeamish. The reality he paints is often stark and harsh but he's always accurate. Characters romp through the story as the reader becomes caught in their lives.

They shared money, books, lovers, living quarters. They careened from love to scandal and back again. They were individualists, scoundrels, idealists, one and all.<br />Christmas 1931: Sylvia Beach (of the Shakespeare and Company bookstore on the Left Bank) noticed a young man, whom she described as \\"a tall, dark young fellow with a small mustache\\" glancing through the magazines.

He had been to shy to present it. `I am writing this,' said the letter,' to make you acquainted with my friend Ernest Hemingway...an American writer instinctively in touch with everything worthwhile going on here and I know you will find both Mr. and Mrs. Hemingway delightful people to know.'\\"<br />Author Humphrey Carter is a British writer who has written biographies of W.H.

It's about using the creative side of the brain to write, which is a concept only recently verified and documented by psychologists. Today they call it &quot;using the right side of the brain.&quot; Gabrielle Rico (WRITING THE NATURAL WAY) wrote the first modern books for writers on the subject 30 years after Brande wrote hers.<br />Ms. Brande, writing in 1934, speaks of &quot;the two sides of the writer.&quot; One side is the author, with the child's innocence of eye, spontaneous, sensitive, able to respond freshly and quickly to new scenes. The other side is the artisan, adult, discriminating, temperate and just. Right brain, left brain.<br />Brande advocates separating the two and gives a series of exercises designed to train the author side to respond willingly. By careful self-training the writer/reader will harness the unconscious and harvest its benefits.<br />Try the exercises -- they work. <br />If you're interested in writing or just in how creative processes work, you'll find this an amazing and useful book.	2002-07-15

When a young mother is slaughtered in southern Illinois, Martin Vail's investigator recognizes the combination of letters on the back of her head. These same letters soon appear on the corpses of a delivery man and an altar boy--the mark of Aaron Stampler. But Stampler has been in an institution for the criminally insane for ten years. Are these copycat murders? Is Stampler loose? Vail and his team must stop the killings, and this time they mean to finish the job.<BR> <BR>While Vail's team struggles with the problem, the reader is treated to plot twists and some piercing prose.  Like: \\"Fog swirled around powerful spotlights in the darkest hours before dawn. Perched atop tall steel poles, they cast harsh beams out across a rancid, steaming wasteland, etching in shadow and light the buttes, knolls, and slopes of trash and refuse, of abandoned plastic bottles, Styrofoam dishes, cardboard fast-food wrappers, old newspapers, abandoned clothing, and maggot-ridden mounds of uneaten food. Like fetid foothills pointing toward the glittering skyscrapers miles away, the city's garbage formed a stunted mountain range of waste.\\"  And there's more. Believe me, a more vivid, more literary description of a garbage dump doesn't exist anywhere in the annals of literature. That's just a tiny sample of Diehl's wordsmith powers.<br />William Diehl honed his craft at the old Atlanta magazine as a writer and a photographer. On his 50th birthday he realized he wanted to write fiction so he turned his back on his old life and wrote a novel. It hit the bestseller list. So did his second. And his third. By the time he got around to writing his Martin Vail trilogy (of which SHOW OF EVIL is the second), he had hit his stride as a best selling, top-drawer author. <br />If you miss William Diehl's books, you've missed some of the most powerful writing around.	2002-07-15

You might even remember that Sports Illustrated featured Finch in 1985, and you may not have noticed that it was their April (Fool) issue.<br />Plimpton weaves a whimsical tale of a young man who, by happenstance, spent enough time in a Himalayan monastery to learn how to throw a baseball 168 miles an hour (didn't know monasteries taught such things, did you?) He's unerringly accurate, to boot! <br />Starting with a seemingly innocent invitation to a burned-out journalist (Plimpton?) to enjoy a Goodyear blimp ride in Florida, the tale unfolds as baseball moguls try to inveigle Finch into signing on with the Mets. Finch, of course, is anything but your average kid from the Babe Ruth league. Finch finally signs, and with 81 strikes puts away the St. Louis Cardinals. Sensation reigns in the baseball world.<br />Does he go on to finish the season without giving up so much as a foul tip? Finch has many a surprise in store for friend and foe alike.<br />Sprinkled with Plimptonesque asides on a wide variety of subjects like Vietnam, the Mafia, sports management, and writers (he even describes himself at one point), this is a pleasant literary/sports romp. It's short enough to read in one evening and enjoyable enough to remain with you a lot longer.	2002-07-15

Her views on world social and political scenes from the 1950s through the '80s are brutally witty, perceptive and emotional.<br />Essays about drug and rock scenes re-published from Rolling Stone, Oz and other avant-garde publications explore unconventionality, but her frantic tone and obvious attempt to shock for the sake of shocking weaken her voice. In these early writings, Greer is the Chicken Little of her generation, racing around shouting, \\"The sky is falling.\\"<br />Thirty years later, Greer is still racing but her more mature writings show development of a unique set of values and a complexity of spirit.

He's written a number of novels, among the THE BOOK OF LAUGHTER AND FORGETTING and THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING. In this, his first nonfiction effort, Kundera relates the concept of the novel to his own work. The first two essays were inspired by an interview he gave to The Paris Review on his practical experiences with the art of the novel.<br />His focus goes beyond his own work, however. Kundera presents some rather intense and unusual analyses of his personal favorite writers: Cervantes, Rabelais, Sterne, Diderot, Flaubert, Tolstoy and Kafka, to name just a few.<br />This is a book for the scholarly reader; the reader who knows literature. It is one that illuminates all sorts of possibilities for writing the novel, for Kundera points out the the novel can express life in ways that can't be achieved by any other form. <br />He moves from the general to the specific -- from the form of the novel, to the way others have used it, to his own work. Particularly interesting is his dictionary of 63 key words which he says are essential to understanding his fiction. His observations about the state of contemporary Russian literature -- what is being published and why -- are fascinating. He also expresses his frustration, as an author, with translators of his works and how they handle language.<br />&quot;The art of reading,&quot; wrote Andre Maurois, &quot;is in great part that of acquiring a better understanding of life from one's encounter with a book.&quot; Readers will come away from this with a better understand of the novel as an expression of life as well as deeper insight into a number of classical works.	2002-07-15

These are seamless days of walks and books, of taking walks to Anghiari, Siena, Assisi, and nearby Luciagnano, whose town walls describe a graceful ellipse. At night we grill in the fireplace. . . a seven-mile walk along the firewall cancels the effects of one evening of grilling.&quot;<br />It took some effort to get to these &quot;seamless&quot; days, and that effort is described in simple, colorful and sensuous prose. Beginning with &quot;I am about to buy a house in a foreign country. A house with the beautiful name of Bramasole,&quot; Mayes (easy to confuse the name with Peter Mayle, who did the same in France and wrote about it in much the same way) begins an adventure that, to my taste, is more fun to read about than to do.<br />&quot;A hundred years may not be long enough to restore this house and land,&quot; she writes. &quot;Upstairs I rub windows with vinegar, shining the green scallop of the hills along the sky.&quot; This is work, man! And she loves every minute of it -- and Italy.<br />In the midst of it all and just before she's about to return to the States for a visit, an acquaintance calls, thinking of doing the same thing. &quot;Is it worth it?&quot; the woman asks. Mayle writes, &quot;I recognize the impulse. I recognize the desire to surprise your own life...&quot; The caller asks if there's a downside. Mayes remembers problems faced and conquered and writes, &quot;...this is nothing compared to the absolute joy of being in possession of this remarkable little hillside on the edge of Tuscany.&quot; It has required a mammoth output of energy and imagination but there are no regrets.<br />The recipes scattered throughout are delicious. I remember my own surprise at the quality of the vegetables in Italy and the remarkable cooking of the Italians, whichhad much more to do with fresh vegetables than it did with pasta. And the lemons! Do try the Lemon Cake recipe -- it's ambrosial even using inferior American grocery store fruit.<br />This is a delightful book.

From the time she's a child, food shapes Reichl's mind and life. It's not easy going, either. Most children, raised in the same way, might have turned totally away from anything culinary.<br />Not Reichl. She just adapts. Her disfunctional mother, for example, is a not only a disinterested cook, she's an actively abusive one. &quot;It was just the way she was. Which was taste-blind and unafraid of rot. 'Oh, it's just a little mold,' I can remember her saying on the many occasions she scraped the fuzzy blue stuff off some concoction before serving what was left for dinner.&quot;<br />Against this background Reichl chronicles her own development as gourmet and gourmand -- a remarkable and fascinating transition. She presents a delectable collection of stories about people and food (recipes included) as she works toward her destiny as a famous food writer. <br />I was deeply disturbed about her presentation of her mother as a manic depressive, frightening personality. I'd have been much more comfortable -- and might have even been amused by it -- if that villainy had been presented in the character of a grandmother or aunt. Mothers, I feel, deserve all the respect we can give them! I had to get over it to enjoy the book.<br />That faced, the scenes where she and her brother try to protect guests from their mother's food foibles lend a riotous humor to the story. <br />When she brings a special man to meet her family, &quot;Mom cooked the steaks in her usual fashion, which was to put the meat in the broiler for about a minute, turn it, and announce that dinner was ready. 'It's raw,' Doug whispered, gulping. He ate six ears of corn and pushed his meat around on the plate.&quot;<br />Don't expect lovely, literary prose. Reichl is, after all, a journalist, which means the prose is as lean as a trimmed lamb chop. Do expect an amusing romp through growing-up adventures, friendships and food.	2002-07-14

What does that say about the average American reader's view of him/herself? Do we sense that we're educationally lacking?<br />Too many of America's young people do not have, because they haven't been taught, the knowledge they need to preserve the exceptional way of life they've inherited. They know Harry Potter and West Wing but not the Peloponnesian Wars or who said, \\"To be or not to be.\\" They are culturally illiterate. <br />Cultural literacy is the background information we need to know in order to understand and to communicate in our society. Without it we wouldn't understand what a reviewer says when he likens Julia Roberts in \\"Pretty Woman\\" to \\"Cinderella\\" or when a pundit says the environment is a politician's Achilles heel. <br />\\"To be culturally literate,\\" Hirsch says, \\"is to possess the basic information needed to thrive in the modern world.\\" Readers must understand the writer's unspoken \\"systems of associations.\\" <br />I've taught college-level writing classes and have been astounded to meet students who have never read a book, who don't understand the simplest references to classical literature and who, frankly, don't care.<br />This ignorance threatens our very existence as a free nation. One of the most important points Hirsch makes is the need for the average citizen to understand enough science to comprehend debates about environmental and political issues. He cites the debate over the Strategic Defense Initiative and says of the voting public, \\"...their education should have provided them with the general facts and principles needed to understand the terms of the debate -- how a satellite works, what a laser is and can do, and under what conditions such a system would be likely to succeed or fail.\\" He neglects to mention the historical, social and political backgrounds that enter into the debate but his point applies to those as well.<br />The highest stakes are involved here. The last election was a primary example of the ignorance of the American voter. Many still don't understand what happened and are merrily led down a primrose path of misunderstanding by an equally Constitutionally (as in the US Constitution)uninformed press. Further, and even sadder, they don't bother to find out!<br />Read CULTURAL LITERACY. Absorb it. Make it your mantra and work to see that the next generation of Americans learns the background of their culture as well as the history, sociology and science they need to protect our way of life at the ballot box.	2002-07-13

Andrew Jackson looked like a bit of a lemon (as far as the American voter was concerned) when he went into the White House. When he came out, he looked much better. How did he do it?<br />This is a careful condensation of Remini's 3-volume work on Jackson that incorporates the result of more recent scholarship and research. Remini describes our 7th President's struggle to overcome his reputation as a violent and vengeful man who was almost a social outcast in Western Tennessee. <br />Remini analyses Jackson's shortcomings, which include some very human mistakes, and his inability to bring Texas into the Union. Emphasizing that Jackson &quot;served the American people extremely well&quot; by preserving the integrity of the Union, saving the government from misrule, and liquidating the public debt, Remini shows why Jackson was more popular when he left the White House than he was when he went in. Don't look for an in-depth political treatise here but you will find sufficient material to give you a well-rounded, sympathetic look at a complicated man in an equally complicated time.<br />It's not meant to be comprehensive -- you'll find that in the larger work -- this is meant to be what it is. It's a fascinating, readable and entertaining story of how that political turn-about happened, written by one of America's foremost biographers.	2002-07-13

Reading this story is like looking at a framed picture of a framed picture.<br />The two tales, one of two self-absorbed women making a half-hearted attempt at a friendship, the other of a family tragedy relayed in a story-within-a-story, converge when a character from the second story arrives on the \\"friendship\\" scene. That took the focus of the book from the book borrower and the friendship and placed the entire narrative firmly into deus ex machina.<br />Also, the relationship between Toby (Ruben) and Deborah is more of an acquaintanceship than a friendship. They don't connect except in a superficial way. The \\"book\\" about the trolley strike is amazingly dull and I wondered why anyone would read it in the first place. Literary devices like the use of dashes instead of quotation marks and jumping back and forth from \\"reality\\" to the fantasy of the book are distracting and amateurish. I had to fight to finish this book. I kept falling asleep.<br />I'm not sure what the author intended here. Was it to show how a book can provide distraction from the trials of life? Or how it could affect a friendship and/or a life? Or to, as the ... reviewer said, \\"reconnect the bloody world to the lives of her characters?\\" Through fantasy? Whatever, it didn't work.<br />There's an old Southern expression that fits here: \\"Tryin' to but can't.\\"	2002-07-12

She's one of the most visible poets in America today and very much loved. It's not that she's little known because she was America's Poet Laureate a few years ago -- so why leave her out? And why only one poem by William Stafford? Also, clearly one of the universal favorites of Robert Frost's is &quot;Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot; and it's not here, either. (That one shows up in almost any discussion of poetry.)And, only one poem by Robert Penn Warren, another former USA Poet Laureate?<BR>[sigh]<br />I'm also suspicious of a &quot;project&quot; that doesn't seem to have been announced widely before it began -- it can't be representative of ALL Americans since all Americans obviously didn't know about it. <br />All that said, it's a great collection. Through it I met several new poets (new to me)and I certainly enjoyed the ones I was already familiar with. It made me curious, too, about just what the American taste in poetry truly would be. I suspect it would include Ogden Nash and Edgar Allen Poe. <br />No. I don't think it's representative of the poetic taste of the American public and I don't think it should claim to be so, but I do think it's a great overview of popular poets and a superb collection of poems.	2002-07-12

I hope Maurice Druon lives -- and writes -- forever. <br />Reality meets history at the hand of a master writer in each of Druon's books. This one is the story of the growth of Paris from its beginning before Roman times as an island village to Louis VIII and the archives of St. Louis. We can only hope he will write another volume to bring the story up to the modern megalopolis we know as the City of Light. <br />The story told here is amazing but it is the writing that brings it to life and attaches the reader firmly to the page. The fortunes of the city waxed and waned over the centuries.<br />After the death of Charlemagne, for example, \\"Apart from the sounds of commerce, and the ringing of coin from the mint which the emperor had authorised, there was silence on the banks of the Seine, a sort of historical torpor. The awakening was to be bloody.\\"<br />After that awakening a respite, then the Norsemen came, \\"...at Easter, 843, 120 Danish ships attacked Paris. The people fled into the country; the city was sacked, and when the ships left they were down to the gunwales under the weight of booty. Among much else, the Norsemen carried away the splendid bronze roof of Saint-Germain-le-Dore....Paris received another visitation at Christmas 856, and several churches lost their roofs.\\"<br />The story of Paris is the story of kings and saints, men and women who lived adventure, faced destiny and either gave in to or changed history. \\"Great men do not make history,\\" Druon writes, \\"but it needs them, and history cannot be made without them.\\" <br />Too many histories are drab dates and dull records of events. Druon shows us the exploits and achievements of history and the men and women who acted and reacted to affect the way it all turned out.<br />\\"Paris was to grow longer, but concentrically, like a tree. As we count the years in the section of a tree, so we can measure ring by ring on successive maps of Paris, the work of the centuries, history's cold winters and the richsummers of prosperity.\\"<br />I give this book my highest recommendation. I can't imagine anyone, young or old, educated or uneducated, not enjoying it to the fullest. No matter who you are, how well you know or do not know Paris, you are in for a real treat.<br />Also, if you can find copies of his ACCURSED KINGS books -- about the kings of France, do so! They are the best written and their stories make the Plantagenets and the British monarchy look like a bunch of easy living wimps.<br />Anything by Maurice Druon is a winner.	2002-07-12

Her books are mostly about people enmeshed in the ceremonies, traditions and frustrations of contemporary relationships.<br />Maggie and Ira Moran, married 26 years, are on their way from their home in Baltimore to the funeral of an old friend in Pennsylvania. In the scope of one day and in 200 miles, Tyler explores the ties that hold a family together with warmth and a sense of irony.<br />Maggie's a bungler, an incorrigible meddler concerned with everyone's problems but her own, trying to make everything turn out all right for others while her marriage flounders. Ira is the typical middle-aged failure, a man to whom ambition is a long-dead memory but who agonizes over his mediocrity.<br />Through leaps back and forth through time and imagination, Tyler draws a message that comes through loud and clear: how important it is to realize how much we love those nearest and dearest to us. It's a look at aging that won't shock those who are experiencing it as much as it will younger folks who haven't thought this far ahead. The lessons are important.	2002-07-11

It's a startlingly imaginative work in which Heller blends three disparate times in history. Aristotle awakens as Rembrandt applies paint to canvas. When Rembrandt paints his ear, Aristotle hears. As the brush perfects the eyes, Aristotle sees. And always, Aristotle observes.<br />Heller portrays life in mid-17th century Amsterdam and in the 3rd century before Christ, commenting on similarities to modern living, jumping back and forth between the ages, and tracing the 300-year history of the portrait. It's quite a mix, and that's where the book fails. He just doesn't pull it off.<br />The book reminds me of a game of checkers played without rules. It's an uncoordinated hopscotch through centuries, filled with distractions, tangents and irrelevant side trips. It's as though he tried to combine several books into one and missed.<br />Heller's books (CATCH-22, GOD KNOWS, etc.) are unique. Maybe he just tried too hard to be different. The text lacks discipline, organization and the feel for language we expect from master writers. Paragraphs are disjointed, sentences are clumsy and overburdened. Too often they just plain don't make any sense.<br />&quot;The great seaport city of Amsterdam was then the richest and busiest shipping center in the world. The great seaport city of Amsterdam was not a seaport but is situated a good seventy miles from the closest deepwater shipping facilities in the North Sea.&quot; That's amateurish and sloppy. And typical. <br />Heller's mediocre, journalistic style (reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's) is inadequate for the job he has cut out for himself. The superb, sensitive and imaginative scholarship displayed in PICTURE THIS deserves organized, disciplined, and equally sensitive writing. It didn't get it.	2002-07-11

With other prisoners he's shipped to Italy and then on to Poland. <br />Colonel Graf Peter-Paul von Grieffenberg, German nobleman and pre-war friend of Bellmon's father-in-law, learns of Russian atrocities in Poland. Anxious to alert the American government to Russian war crimes, von Grieffenberg arranges to have Bellmon visit the sites and provide him with photographs and documentation.<br />Tech sergeant Rudy MacMillan arrives with a truckload of dispirited, demoralized American prisoners. Under Bellmon's leadership, MacMillan shapes up the troops and the two become fast friends. <br />Meanwhile, back at West Point, Cadet Corporal Sanford T. Felter decides to resign from the Corps and got to war. Because of his fluency in Russian, Polish and German, he is assigned to headquarters, 40th Armored Division, in Europe.<br />As the war grinds to an end in 1945, the Russians are on the move. Von Grieffenberg's troops march the American officers from Poland into Germany, leaving enlisted men to fend for themselves. <br />The story goes on to postwar Germany where Gen. Waterford wants his polo team to beat the French and since the French will play only with officers, Waterford promotes his best polo player from Private to Lieutenant. Sandy Felter (the West Pointer) ends up in Greece.<br />The series is a fascinating look at a history of the army. It's pretty thorough and always entertaining. Griffin's writing is more journalistic than literary but he tells a rousing story. Military enthusiasts should love this series.	2002-07-11

It was sensitive, subtle, intelligent, romantic and witty -- qualities seldom found in movies today. Shortly after seeing the movie, I discovered it was available in book form. I'm intensely aware of the gap between movies and the books they try to emulate, so I was anxious to read the print version.<br />WOW!<br />October 5, 1949. Helene Hanff is a writer who is determined to acquire a solid education in classical English literature so she writes a letter to a small bookshop (at 84 Charing Cross Road) to ask about some rather obscure works she'd like to read. She's seen their ad in the Saturday Review of Literature and is encouraged by the fact that they specialize in out-of-print books.<br />Thus begins, with one short, polite inquiry, a chain of events that changes Hanff's life and eventually (in 30 years) catapults her into fame.<br />It is Hanff's personality that carries the story. Writer-like, she infuses it onto paper as she comments on the books she receives and requests more. As WWII ravages England, Hanff sends food packages of rare treats to the penpals she develops at the bookstore. Employees write to her, she exchanges recipes with them and shares her observations as she reads. <br />The manager of the store, Frank Doel, slowly evolves into a romantic figure as Hanff cajoles, teases and chides him and he responds in a particularly British manner.<br />If you love books and people, abhor violence and gratuitous sex, and if you're content with subtleties in relationships combined with sensitive observations about life and literature, this is your book. It's normal, healthy, charming and funny -- a far cry from everyday movie and \\"literary\\" fare.	2002-07-11

She finds a treasure and is delighted to get it for pennies. The day goes along successfully for both until they notice a fellow antiquer's car parked in an odd place. Things don't look right, so they stop to help. The woman dies, speaking one politically incorrect clue at the end.<br />That clue leads authorities to Anneke's friend and Anneke vows to help her. The story moves along at a lively pace. It's an amusing, entertaining read with good characterization in an intriguing setting -- perfect for those of us who love to cozy up with a cozy.	2002-07-07

Over the years I've used it constantly not only for my own inspiration but to use in worship services. Quoist takes common things like subways and doors and tractors, even a pornographic magazine, and through prayer sanctifies them.<br />We must do more than imagine that God is talking to us, he says, we must listen. \\"God addresses us through every event, even the most insignificant.\\" Through these prayers we come to know what it means to \\"pray without ceasing,\\" and we learn that it's not such an effort after all, but a privilege that blesses us beyond our wildest dreams.<br />Here's a sample of what he's about:<br />\\"I went out, Lord.<br />Men were coming and going,<br />Walking and running.<br />\\"Everything was rushing: cars, trucks, the street, the whole town.<br />Men were rushing not to waste time.<br />They were rushing after time,<br />To catch time,<br />To gain time....<br />\\"...You understand, Lord, they simply haven't the time.<br />The child is playing, he hasn't the time right now...later on..<br />The schoolboy has his homework to do, he hasn't time...later on..<br />The young man is at his sports, he hasn't the time...later on..<br />The young married man has his new house; he has to fix it up. He hasn't time...later on...<br />The grandparents have their grandchildren. They haven't time...Later on...<br />They are ill, they have their treatments, they haven't time...Later on...<br />They are dying...they have no...<br />Too late!...They have no more time!<br />\\"And so all men run after time, Lord.<br />They pass through life running -- hurried, jostled, overburdened, frantic, and they never get there. They haven't time....\\"<br />There's much more to the poem, of course, but you see his style and some of his message. These poetic prayers speak to the world and life as we live it today.\\"<br />This is a very special book for all generations; it is uplifting, comforting and sustaining. Put this on your bedside table and let it wake you and ready you for sleep and it will give your soul rest and consolation all the days of your life.	2002-07-07

Did you know, for example, that anthropologists believe the first kiss originated 4,000 years ago in what is now eastern India? Since that's after Moses' time, I wonder if he died without ever being kissed?<br />Walker says the world's most torrid love poem was written in the 18th century and to see a copy you'd have to have special permission from the board of governors at the British Museum. Not only that, you'd have to read it -- under guard -- in a special room at the museum. Now that's great PR. It's like telling college freshmen that state law prevents them from reading Chapter 3 in their geology book. I bet that law prompted more students to read about evolution than ever would have without it.<br />That's a small example of the fascinating little snippets of information in this book.

The cowboy boot symbolizes one character's achievement, the secret in the potato barn represents the hero's.<br />Rabo Karbekian (from BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS) is an aging artist writing his autobiography. He recounts his parents' stories -- their immigration from Armenia. His mother adaptated to life in America, his father didn't.<br />Vonnegut moves his story skillfully between past and present. Karabekian's work -- his paintings -- have disintegrated into dust of the floors of galleries and private collections worldwide (did A. Wyeth's work inspire this story?) but he now owns the largest collection \\"of abstract expressions paintings still in private hands.\\" A widower, he has adopted two friends, a has-been novelist and Circe, a widow he finds on the beach. Circe inspires him to write his autobiography and it is to her that he reveals the secret in the potato barn (which, in his mind likens him to the Bluebeard of fairy tale fame).<br />The reader will enjoy this book on several political and philosophical levels in addition to enjoying a fine story. It is tender yet sometimes loveless, a blending of wisdom and insanity.<br />Vonnegut's writing is of the Hemingway/Dick-and-Jane style -- short, sharp and exasperating. He writes like someone who has no appreciation for the English language and wants to use as little of it as possible. That's stylish today, but vexing to someone who likes to read. I find his author intrusion distracting and annoying but his characters enchant, his wit amuses and his observations stimulate. BLUEBEARD's wit, substance and style are pure Vonnegut.	2002-07-06

Pilcher's stories create worlds the reader wants to settle into and stay in.<br />Penelope (I see her as Kate Hepburn in &quot;Summertime&quot;) has a painting that she especially loves. Her father did it years ago, of her playing on the beach, and titled it &quot;The Shell Seekers.&quot; Now her deceased father's paintings have become valuable. When the story begins, Penelope returns home from a hospital stay. She has released herself, feeling that she has sufficiently recovered from her heart attack. She feels an increased sensitivity to life and relationships and she's driven by a need to accomplish some final things with family and friends.<br />There's a great deal to be desired in her relationship with two of her children and with their relationship with each other. They want her to sell the painting and their motives are selfish. <br />As the story progresses, Penelope feels the need to return to her childhood home. She invites each child to go with her and each refuses for one reason or another. So she takes two cherished young friends on a pilgrimage into her past that changes their destinies. And hers.<br />Pilcher creates women characters who are strong and independent and at the same time feminine. Penelope doesn't need a man to help her work through her problems but when one comes along, she's gracious and kind. <br />This book is about values and relationships, hope and dreams, rights and wrongs. It's a delightful story that I hated to end. I wanted it to go on and on and on.	2002-07-06

This overview of English history, full of characters to love and hate, begins with the earliest settling of the Salisbury Plain by primitive hunters and farmers. As civilization develops and flourishes, so the story, evolving into a saga of five families who shape and are shaped by the events of this bit of the British historical story.<br />The creation of Stonehenge will invade your imagination. Christianity comes and the Salisbury Cathedral is a result. Lives and loves of men and women with their triumphs and disappointments evolve against the parade of ages -- kings and their wars and kingdoms, plagues, revolutions, until we get to Queen Victoria and an age that developed faster than ever. The reader gets the impression of a snowball rolling downhill -- time begins with few people and slower development but one bit of progress inspires 30 more and on it goes, bigger and faster ad infinitum.<br />Rutherford's research is thorough but it doesn't impede his story. With narrative under strict control, his style is clear, descriptive and tight. Relationships wax and wane through the generations as families grow and change with the times.<br />Rutherford has said about this book that he admires James Michener and deliberately set out to accomplish for England what Michener did for Hawaii, Texas and others. I think he did it better.	2002-07-06

How is this different from any other writing book out there, you ask? Well, here's how to evaluate what you've written, how to recognize and fix awkward transitions and wordy or clumsy sentences, how to find hidden flaws all through your writing and what to do about them. <br />Rewriting is the crux of communication through words on paper. &quot;Books aren't written, they are re-written&quot; is so very true. School children aren't taught to get it down on paper, then go back and revise once...and again...and again...and again. They are taught to look for spelling and punctuation errors and encouraged (by default) to leave their work as close to the first draft as possible. Professional writers learn quickly the importance of revision.<br />Cheney clarifies the issue and leads the reader down the thorny path of pruning, clarifying and restructuring for the best possible prose.	2002-07-06

Daniel Boorstin is one of the men I'd like to invite to dinner along with Justice Renquist and Thomas Jefferson. He's a historian par excellence. In HIDDEN HISTORY he publishes a series of essays that explore the more unfamiliar aspects of familiar events.<br />HIDDEN HISTORY helps us to see our forefathers in unexpected roles and learn to see our society from new perspectives.<br />&quot;...the prize for which Europeans would have to shed blood would seem the free native birthright of Americans,&quot; he writes. &quot;The history of the United States has thus had a unity and coherence unknown in Europe. Many factors -- our geographical isolation, our special opportunities for expansion and exploitation within our own borders and our remoteness from Europe have, of course, contributed...but, whatever the causes, the winds of dogma and the gusts of revolution which during the last two centuries have blown violently over Western Europe...have not ruffled our intellectual climate.&quot;<br />Boorstin says that the American Revolution was hardly a revolution at all, at least not in the sense of the modern European understanding of evolution. He quotes Alexis de Tocqueville, &quot;the social condition and the Constitution of the Americans are democratic, but they have not had a democratic revolution.&quot; Boorstin says this fact &quot;is surely one of the most important of our history.&quot;<br />Boorstin's theories, his arguments, the pictures he presents of events and people who shaped our nation's history -- all jolt the reader's awareness and awaken to higher interest and sensibilities. They fan the flicker of patriotism that hides in complacency.<br />HIDDEN HISTORY is scholarly but it is far from dull. It challenges our perceptions of our own history and our role in the world; it whets the appetite for understanding. It should NEVER go out of print.	2002-07-06

That would be quite a loss but for Gardner and the readers.<br />As a published author of many book reviews as well as magazine articles and newspaper pieces, I was at a loss as to where to turn when I needed advice on writing fiction. My solution was to take a course and this book was the required reading. Otherwise I would have overlooked it since I would in no way classify myself as young.<br />It's simply one of the best books available, especially for those who want to write literary fiction and who care about the quality of his/her writing. Character building, plotting, vocabulary, sentence structure, style and the idea of fiction as a dream are studied in depth here. It is a book to be studied and re-studied, read and re-read, for as the reader practices writing fiction and gains more experience, there's more to be found.<br />At the back of the book there are exercises. These are best done in a group so that you can get the benefits of others' critiques. The concepts here are deep and often open to more than one interpretation -- those come out in a group setting.<br />Read carefully. Be sure you understand the subtleties of what he's saying. If you give this one a shallow reading, you're likely to misinterpret. If you do, you'll loose a lot.<br />I'd put this at the top of my favorites books in a list of books for writers along with Jack Bickham's, Dwight Swain's and Gary Provost's books on the craft.	2002-07-06

Opponents might point out that NATO's proactive stance in world crises seems to have had at least a mild deterrant effect since its inception and that although we have gone into countries with other nations to stabilize political situations, we have not had to do it alone.<br />Read this one and consider his points.

It's an impressive first outing.<br />Innocent, young and pretty Barbara Anderley has led a sheltered life. When she and her sister and brothers were abandoned by her courtesan mother, they were taken in by a doting grandmother. Life on their 18th century country estate was a somewhat isolated and protected one.<br />Barbara's father has recently fled to support a pretender to the British throne. Her mother, a flamboyant libertine,  arranges a marriage between Barbara and Roger Montgeoffrey, Count of Devane. Barbara is thrilled, for she has known -- and loved -- the Count since childhood. Devane marries her for her dowry, admitting that he doesn't love her but she vows to win his love. (Names keep reminding me of DuMaurier's REBECCA -- Anderley for Manderley, Devane and Dewinter...look for more similarities.)<br />As they move among the courts of France and England, Barbara becomes beautiful, worldly and sought-after as she falls more and more deeply in love with her husband. Then she discovers his terrible secret and her world falls apart.<br />This is a fast-moving story with interesting, if predictable, characters. Readers of historical romance expect certain characters (beautiful heroines and handsome heroes, for example) and they want the story to develop certain ways. This one falls right along those lines. Don't look for lilting prose and surprising plot here but if you enjoy historical romances, you'll love THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY.	2002-07-06

He claims that the public has lost confidence in the military and that the loss of that confidence has created a critical deficiency in terms of combat readiness, field leadership and infantry training. Issues he covers are Vietnam, the volunteer draft, nuclear arms, detente (this book was written in the mid-80s), the MX. He also discusses the effect public outcry against the war in Southeast Asia had on defense and exposes the bureaucratic wrangling that plagues the defense budget.<br />Although it was written some time ago, the political forces he mentions are very much active today and affect our war against terrorists.

I'd never come up with a satisfactory animal, but I'd never thought of the Polar bear.<br />I'd like to be a Polar bear. Their winter dens sound lovely and I can imagine cradling a cub in my arms, leaning back against an ice floe and gazing off across the Arctic Sea. I'd love wearing the translucent white fur coat. (I wouldn't want to deprive an animal of one, but I'd love to grow my own.) Swimming has always been a favorite activity of mine, too, and with the fur coat I don't suppose I'd mind the ice water!<br />It's an amazing thing to empathize with an animal!<br />Lopez's descriptions of the arctic ice and seasons, the people, the history and cultures, all are enchanting. It's a wonderfully magical world, so different from the lands and peoples of the rest of the world. Lopez carves that world into our imaginations as skillfully as the ice sculptor renders his tools.<br />Summer is the perfect time to read this one; especially one of the hottest summers on record!	2002-07-06

Who knows, but it's Western Adventure	I've watched Michael Wallis grow as a writer and I wish he had written this book last instead of first. Now don't get me wrong, it's a rip-roarin' tale of a man with ambition and drive who built a gigantic company and fortune. But it's not the exhaustive, documented last work on Frank Phillips's life.<br />This is as near to an authorized biography as you can get. Wallis was given full access to all the recorded material on Phillips as well as to a great many people who actually knew the man and worked with him. It's a rollicking story.<br />Using fiction techniques of characterization Wallis shows us an eccentric, ambitious young man who evolves into a successful philanthropist -- and philanderer. Phillips gave tokens to the children of the community but overindulged and neglected his own son until he turned to alcohol. He was a man who appeared devoted to his family six months out of every year, then spent the rest of his time with his mistress in New York City.<br />He wasn't such a saint in business, either. He took over smaller companies to build his empire and almost fired a Vice President &quot;Boots&quot; Adams because he thought Adams was too ambitious for personal gain.<br />Legends about Phillips abound and Wallis has recorded them. There's a story, for example, of Phillips paying the mortgages of community churches and herein lies the weakness of this book. He doesn't say whether this generosity is documented or it's simply a tale told by sycophants, and he sure talked to plenty of them.<br />Wallis weakens his authority by neglecting to support his facts. He speculates. Without documentation it's impossible for the reader to separate fiction from fact. The writing style is that of fiction and that's all the more reason the reader needs to be able to tell what is real fact and what is speculation.<br />If what you want is an exciting story of the West and people who made great fortunes in the oil fields, you'll love this book. It's well written and wellresearched. If you want only fact, however, you'll have to write your own book.	2002-07-06

I wonder if he's not a little ahead of himself on that one -- we're talking pre- during and post WWII here. Of course Toscanini's association with the NBC Orchestra paid off in a variety of ways but Horowitz seems to have forgotten the great conductor's incredible sensitivity to the music and the composers that he interpreted.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely but can't agree with the author in a number of respects. Toscanini's fame was, quite obviously, a direct result of his talent, drive and the love audiences had for his interpretation of the music. Those are the facts, pure and simple.<br />The book, however, deserves an unprejudiced and thoughtful reading.	2002-07-06

Every five minutes or so you'll call attention to something in the text -- a choice description, a picturesque flow of words, a bit of hilarity that will reduce you both to laughter. This is a book to be shared.<br />Doig is a gifted writer with the facility of a James Agee in his choice of words and phrasing. On the page he presents a constant wild, vivid sensory impression, as if you were riding on horseback with him through his beloved Montana hills, sharing the terrain, people and history in ways you hadn't experienced before and couldn't experience anywhere else.<br />His descriptions show keen insight and attention to detail through carefully chosen, apt simile and metaphor. &quot;I had noticed at Jordan's,&quot; he writes about a situation he experienced as a child, &quot;...the boarding child is something like a stranded visitor that people get accustomed to half-seeing at the edges of their vision -- and no one, least of all me, seemed to think there was much unusual about my alighting here and there casually as a roosting pullet.&quot;<br />As a young boy, exploring: &quot;For by greatest luck a silvered ship, high-hulled and pinging with emptiness, rode at the far end of the ranch buildings. A ship, at least to my imaginings. In the years when the machine chomped broadly through grainfields, it was called a combine. Now this dreadnaught stood, in its tones of dulling metal and cluster of idle gearwheels, for me to climb into...&quot;<br />Here's the epitome of fine writing. You won't find more vivid images anywhere and he doesn't stint at all with language. Like this description of a teacher: &quot;She was buxom, much like Grandma with a half more plumped all around; her mounding in front and behind was very nearly more than the lackadaisical dresses wanted to contain. Leaning forward from the waist as she hurried about, she flew among us like a schooner's lusty figurehead prowing over a lazy sea.&quot;<br />To read Doig's books is to experience Montana and a world long past. This is a book to be savored, treasured and read again and again.	2002-07-06

Jick is challenged by unexpected changes in new grown-up ways and as he meets those challenges he sees himself and his world through a dying innocence.<br />To say Doig's prose is rich and powerful is like describing a tornado as breezy.

However, his opinions are built on a solid foundation of literary knowledge and he cuts to the core when he perceives deficiencies in an author's reasoning.<br />Don't look for run-of-the mill, running-off-at-the mouth, pseudo-intellectual posturing in these essays. It's not there. Look for style, intellect and humor. And delightful reading.	2002-07-05

It has made all the difference in our lives.<br />One evening my husband and I experienced one of the most embarrassing moments of our entire lives when we took our granddaughters out to dinner. I suddenly realized that they simply had not been taught some pretty basic manners. Modern parents are so busy with two careers and hectic schedules, I suppose.<br />Imagine how thrilled I was to find this book and how even more delighted to discover that when they read it, both girls took the lessons to heart and began to practice them. It saved me the further embarrassment of telling their parents about the painful incident. You back me up on that one: \\"Don't point out other people's bad manners,\\" -- remember? Of course, grandmothers have special advantages in that area, but tact and sometimes even reticence is often the better part of valor.<br />\\"Five good reasons to write thank you notes!\\"  and<BR>\\"The heart of all good manners is the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\\" What brave and wonderful things to write to youngsters in a society that sneers at manners and religion as \\"sentimental\\" and \\"old-fashioned.\\" <br />Because of the lessons here -- from thank you notes to how to entertain friends to telephone manners to introductions and party manners and more -- we are now proud to take the girls anywhere. Their introductions (which we had fun practicing) are truly graceful.<br />Another very important point you make is to treat brothers and sisters like friends. That is, with respect. Practicing that one little idea can change the entire atmosphere in a home.<br />Thank you, Emilie Barnes, for a very important book. This one was so successful for us that I bought the companion volume, A LITTLE BOOK OF MANNERS FOR BOYS and look forward to seeing equally triumphant results among our grandsons.<br />Michel Sparks's illustrations arecolorful and delightfully  whimsical. The visual appeal and emphasis they add to the text makes this a very special book indeed.<br />Thank you again for the lovely and sensitive addition to our children's library and to our lives.	2002-07-05

Her two series, the Death on Demand series and the Henry O series, closely follow the \\"cozy\\" customs. Her sleuths, bookseller Annie Darling in the first and retired journalist Henrietta Collins in the second, are people you'd like to know. They are amateurs, characters who are fully developed and who often find themselves in peril. Through wit, ingenuity and creativity they solve the crime at hand. The emphasis in each story is the reasoning by the protagonist that leads to the eventual solution of the crime(s).<br />In RESORT TO MURDER, Henry O joins her grandchildren and ex-son-in-law at a Bermuda resort for his wedding. The bride is a compulsive flirt, who can't seem to stay away from men. The groom is jealous. Stir into this mix a hotel owner whose husband may have committed suicide because of the bride-to-be, a granddaughter who dislikes the bride so much she threatens to kill her, a touch of blackmail and a roaming \\"ghost\\" and you have a story you won't want to put down until you finish it.<br />Hart's strong point is puzzle solving. We follow Henry O's analyses, her interventions and consequences and her re-evaluations until right up to the conclusion. Then the story finishes with the classical confrontation scene that is almost a \\"must\\" in this kind of story.<br />I've read all of Hart's books and eagerly await the next. If you haven't met Henry O or Annie Darling yet, put them at the top of your to-read list. You won't be sorry.	2002-07-05

Mrs. Jones feels that Christmas needs children. \\"Couldn't we have a little girl?\\" she asks. But Mr. Jones thinks she's daft.

Society sees love as \\"supercilious, unscientific bosh.\\" The individual must develop him- or herself to the fullest to discover and celebrate her own uniqueness. Society wrongly teaches us to value a person for what she has rather than who she is or what she does. Buscaglia sounds the battle cry for freedom -- refuse to be molded into a likeness deemed \\"proper\\" by societal codes. Rather, be free to become your own person, loving yourself and your fellowman.<br />Everyone should have someone in his or her life who says, \\"I will love you no matter what...if you fall on your face, if you do the wrong thing, if you make mistakes, if you behave like a human being -- I will love you no matter.\\"<br />He's pretty hard on the educational system, saying it has stifled individuality and creativity in children. \\"The true fuction of the child's education should be the process of helping him to discover his uniqueness, aiding him toward its development and teaching him how to share it with others.\\" This is where I take issue with him, having pretty well agreed up to this point. Our schools have excelled in doing that very thing to the detriment of the three R's and as a result we have college freshmen who are arrogant and disrespectful, who have never read a book and who can't spell. (I speak from personal experience in teaching college level creative writing.)<br />I do agree with his emphasis on honesty and truth, however, believing as I do that it is the very foundation of our society and has not been emphasized to children for much too long.<br />Do read this one. It's a book that will confront you and make you think. You may or may not agree with him -- or with me -- but you will enjoy analyzing his points and developing your own views on the subjects.	2002-07-05

Then he goes into detail in working with values, handling color, directing the eye, composing with color, and interpreting light. The last two sections of the book deal with critiques, solutions and learning from the masters. There's also a useful bibliography that's divided into books about painting and those on drawing.

I've also self-published a cookbook. RECIPES INTO TYPE is the most useful book I've seen on the subject.<br />I've been amused as time after time students have expressed surprise and wonder at the different ways there are to present recipes. They have learned, through studying books like this one, to evaluate cookbooks as well as to construct easy to read, well designed and consistent ones for themselves.<br />A lot of cookbooks are carelessly constructed, written by inarticulate writers. Too many recipes are unclear in their instructions or ingredients are missing or out of order. RECIPES INTO TYPE attempts to provide standards of styling and handling for food writers and editors.<br />Suggestions begin with titling. The title should be &quot;inviting and even a little romantic,&quot; they say. They describe the use of headnotes and devote time and space to how to list ingredients (another area that consistently suprised my students). They really get into details here, like combining different quantities of the same ingredient, not combining different ingredients, being specific, giving alternatives and more. These are things the average food writer just doesn't think of, and its detail like this that often is left out of the average how to write a cookbook book.<br />The authors go into similar detail about writing instructions, too. Everyone remembers to divide steps logically, but few notice redundancies or think to share their knowledge of cooking when writing them. They also seldom remember to tell readers about alternative ingredients, but these authors remember.<br />The book is full of information but its strong point is that it provides standardization in an area that really needs it. It's too bad that the chairpersons of various community cookbook committees don't look to this book for advice. They would certainly turn out a superior product if they did.	2002-07-04

And, when you think of it, what's more important?<br />You can design a web site, sure, but making it something folks learn from and want to come back to is something else. So is making it easy to use and chocking it full of the kind of information visitors want to see. His emphasis is on the business site, but the principles apply to everyone. If your web site is just for play, and you don't care about usability, this book isn't for you.<br />In the introduction, &quot;Why web usability,&quot; Nielsen points out that there are two approaches to web site design: one of artistic expression and the other of problem solving for the customer (meaning web site visitor). He promises a systematic approach to designing a site that encompasses both. He accomplishes his goal beautifully. For each principle he gives, he provides a background of statistical support.<br />This is not a book about how to construct a web site as much as it's about how to make that site attractive and easy to use. As he says, you'll have to go elsewhere to learn HTML and how to design and put your site on the web but you should read this first to learn what your customers or audience want and how to make your site useful as well as appealing.<br />Common errors in web design include: Treating the web like a business brochure, managing a site as if it were a traditional corporate project, structuring the site to mirror the company, creating gorgeous pages that look great to insiders but don't necessarily appeal to customers, writing that's linear, and not linking to relevant sites that would be helpful to your customers. &quot;The Web is a new medium and requires a new approach, as explained in this book,&quot; he writes.<br />This is an intelligent book. It's not hard reading but on the other hand, it's not written for children. It's full of new vision and great advice. It's definitely not the only book you should have on web design, but it should be in your collection.	2002-07-04

In it you'll find the answer to just about any designing problem you face.<br />Perhaps the most challenging aspect of web design is how to make a site not only attractive but accessible to a variety of browsers and to have it look the way you want it to in each. Niederst begins there. She explains browsers (most people seem to use Navigator rather than Explorer)and a variety of design strategies. To design for the lowest common denominator (for instance), splitting the difference or something for everyone --the choice is yours.<br />Chapters are divided into Designing for different browsers, for a variety of displays, Web design principles, a guide to the server. She includes a great overview of HTML, tags, text, links and adding images, tables, forms and frames. Under graphics she explains GIF, JPEG, PNG and teaches designing graphics. There's also lots of information on animated GIFs, audio, interactivity and javascript.<br />In a section titled Emerging Technologies she explains cascading style sheets, DHTML, XML, embedded font technology and internationalization. In the appendixes you'll find HTML tags and elements, list of attributes, deprecated tags, proprietary tags and CSS compatibility.<br />This book is basic and thorough, but it's going to have to be revised for Windows XP. That aside, it's a useful reference because it's easy to find information and Niederst seems to be able to anticipate problems, explain them and provide useful solutions. So far the answer to every question I've had has been easy to find in this book. I give it the highest recommendation. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I've recently decided to reserve those for exceptionally beautiful writing.	2002-07-04

I think it's insulting and arrogant to place the reader in the position of claiming to be stupid in order to obtain information about something. It would show more respect (and therefore be deserving of money earned from sales) if titles were something like &quot;HTML Simplified&quot; or something.<br />There! I'm glad I FINALLY got that off my chest.<br />All that said, I bought this because it was required in an online course I took. (I resent the title so much it actually hurt to pay for it. I may not know much about computers, but that doesn't mean I'm a dummy.)<br />As I went through it I decided the dummy isn't the reader at all. I leave it to you to decide just who is! Compare this book to Jakob Nielsen's DESIGNING WEB USABILITY (subtitle: The Practice of Simplicity)and it comes out sadly lacking. In DUMMIES the humor is strained and sometimes inappropriate (tests should be serious)and there's too much repetition (stating something twice -- the second time as a reminder -- is plenty). As far back as Chapter 20 the authors are still saying things like, &quot;Going easy on the graphics, bells, whistles and hungry T.Rexes.&quot; <br />Web design is fun. It's easy to learn. But that doesn't mean that because you don't understand it, you're dumb. It just means you ought to buy a different book on the subject, one that shows respect for the reader.	2002-07-04

(At least they used to.) He discusses some pet peeves: reundancies like &quot;true facts,&quot; &quot;free gift,&quot; rain shower,&quot;free verse.&quot; &quot;Free verse is to prosody as  drip-and-dribble is to painting,&quot; he says.<br />He points out that all off us speak a variety of sub-languages.

Jubal travels by foot and is tracked by a Native American early in his journey. They become friends and decide to travel together. Through their growing friendship the reader learns of traditions and beliefs of a variety of tribes.<br />The narrative, written in first person, often has a poetic lilt that reminds me of &quot;Evangeline.&quot;<br />&quot;Endlessly wound the river along its timbered banks, brushing the roots of leaning trees, heavy with foliage. Dead trees, uprooted far upstream, were a danger to birchbark canoes, and at no time dared we to relax. Around each bend, and the twists and turns were many, might lie enemy Indians or some obstruction to rip our bottom out.&quot; <br />Native customs enrich the narrative. Describing Jubal's attempts to communicate with members of another tribe, L'Amour writes, &quot;We had fumbled together a way of speaking. We knew some Cherokee...although Indians who knew the language of another tribe were rare...&quot;<br />L'Amour's love of classical literature and books seeps into his writing like a vein of mineable golden prose, saturating it with abundant information on a myriad of subjects.

He points out that the 3rd commandment has had an immense affect on the customs and laws of world societies.<br />The 3rd chapter is devoted entirely to reconciling evolution and the Biblical account of creation. In Chapter 4, Crouch describes what is right and what is wrong in current scientific thinking (which changes as technology develops). He points out that three crucial events can't be explained by science: The creation of the universe, the creation of the first living cell, and the development of man as the only living creature who has intelligence and an understanding and knowledge of God.<br />In the last three chapters Crouch covers a number of issues: among them gravity, electricity, chemical reactions. Lucky accidents, he asks? He sails into spacement, UFOs, government money and medical hoaxes with jubilant abandon.<br />Readable, thoughtful, entertaining and arguable. A great book for a book club discussion.	2002-07-03

Her father has invested the family savings in a floundering newspaper. Julie becomes its star reporter and, in the year the book covers, she matures into a lovely young woman.<br />Exploitative labor practices in the local steel mill, a minister who defies the town powers to provide support for downtrodden workers, Julie's youthful idealism, her father's illness and struggle to build his newspaper and establish himself in the community all combine with teenage awakening and a couple of natural disasters to make a highly entertaining and spiritually enlightening book. Turns out the book is autobiographical and it's at least as successful as Marshall's CHRISTY.<br />Marshall's style is light and entertaining, never &quot;preachy.&quot; But she gets a message across by demonstrating the power of faith and love in her characters' lives. Characters are full and vibrant, the story line moves tantalizingly and the language of the book is delightful.<br />I can't imagine anyone not enjoying JULIE.	2002-07-03

When the spokesman tells them they have no treasure \\"except the blue of the water and the pink of our maidens' cheeks and lips, and the green of our fields,\\" the pirates don't believe them and search high and low.<br />Meanwhile, the captain of the ship, who hates the letter O, issues an edict. \\"I'll get rid of the letter O, in upper case and lower...All words in books or signs with an O in them shall have the O erased or painted out. We'll print new books and paint new signs without an O in them.\\" Thus objects and words with Os are banished from the land forever.<br />Disaster! Imagine the impact on community life! No houses, cottages or bungalows -- only huts, shacks, sheds, shanties and cabins without logs. No dough for the baker, no gold for the goldsmith, no forge for the blacksmith, no cloth for the tailor, no chocolate for the candymaker. (NOW you've gone too far!) No poetry without Os.<br />Thurber writes, \\"A man named Otto Ott, when asked his name, could only stutter. Ophelia Oliver repeated hers, and vanished from the haunts of men.\\"<br />\\"We can't tell shot from shoot or hot from hoot,\\" the blacksmith pointed out in a meeting with other townsfolk. \\"Oft becomes the same as foot, and odd the same as dodo. Something must be done at once or we shall never know what we are saying.\\"<br />The islanders decide that there are four words with an O that must not be lost. Hope, love and valor are three of them and the fourth is the point of the story.<br />This is a beautifully written, rhythmic tale. THE WONDERFUL O will appeal to everyone who loves language. The story is a challenge to the imagination of the reader.	2002-07-03

Britain's literature begins with its myths and legends. This book is an entertaining outline of English history as the background of its literature.<br />About the legends of Ireland, for example, Adams writes, &quot;There are a great many more stories than the 'Ulster cycle&quot; of Celtic legend, and there is another entire cycle of primitive stories from the south of Ireland, dealing with Finn MacCool, his trusty band of Fenian comrades, and his son the warrior-poet Ossian. Readers of Yeats and Joyce will recognize, again and again, in the characters and episodes of ancient Irish legend, the origins of persons and events, as well as the point of hundreds of allusions, in these modern writers.&quot;<br />Adams does not pretend to write a comprehensive book without prejudice. &quot;There are two long stories to tell,&quot; he writes, &quot; and very little space to tell them, other elements of the background must be treated only intermittently...I make no apology for having introduced my own enthusiasms into the literary commentary.&quot; After all, it IS his book. He gets to choose what to say and how to say it. It's well that he doesn't apologize because his &quot;enthusiasms&quot; are what makes the book readable and delightful.<br />This isn't an anthology -- the reader will have to track down copies of works but there's a bibliography and references to writers and their publications are plentiful. He doesn't confine himself to just the well-known literary works, but offers examples of lesser-known works, as well.<br />This is reading that will give you insight into your travels as well as suggest fascinating new books that will challenge you to see modern writing in a new light. It's an additional perspectiveon English literature that you'll enjoy pursuing.	2002-07-03

The book narrates the development of the technology that culminated in that nightmare of firestorm and destruction. It is also the story of the Allies's attempt to end the war by annihilating certain German cities.<br />On the night of July 28, 1943, a firestorm occurred, the result of the British \\"area bombing\\" method used in the attack on the city. The center of the storm, which covered a 4-square-mile area, is estimated to have reached a temperature of 800 degrees Centigrade.

No amount of effort brings any sense of memory, so he has no choice but to struggle on about his business, which includes a game of bowling opposite the police chief and her team.<br />Abby Hooper is the controversial new police chief who has just beaten Keegan out of the job. She's young, qualified and enthusiastic and facing sexist opposition from at least half the town. That half doesn't include Keegan who, in spite of the fact that he has just broken up with her mother, likes Abby very much. <br />When fishermen find the nude body of a teenage girl at water's edge by Keegan's dock, all signs point to Keegan as her murderer.  As the story progresses, Frank learns facts he doesn't want Abby to know and Abby becomes more suspicious of Frank.<br />Here's a cliff-hanger story that is full of surprises and should keep you glued to the tape deck until you find out just what did happen. Characters are deftly drawn .  One of the problems with tapes is that men must read women's  voices credibly (and vice versa). Richard Rohan handles that problem nicely.	2002-07-02

In books on tape a lot depends on the reader. A fine reader can make a poor book sound good. Rohan's an excellent reader.<br />When authorities are called to the scene of a spectacularly gruesome murder of an elderly couple by their retarded grandson, Jonathan Hamilton, they immediately assume that he's the perpetrator. The assumption is seemingly verified by his confession when taken into custody. As the story unfolds, though, the actions of those authorities come under question. Evidence such as blood on Jonathan's forehead and hands and bloody footprints solidify opinions against the young man.<br />Matthew Fielder, a big-city criminal defense lawyer drop-out, especially trained to handle \\"death cases,\\" is assigned to defend Jonathan and the more he learns about the case, the more he's convinced that Jonathan is innocent. The battle lines are drawn and both sides go for the jugular as the trial commences, its fury fed by the media into a frenzy.<br />A chilling story, laced with legal detail and feisty, memorable characters, FLAT LAKE IN WINTER is just the tale to see you through a quiet, fall evening. Klempner's legal fiction compares pretty favorably with Grisham's.	2002-07-02

Turns out the rakish, red-haired, inhumanly handsome Ryan is her son and the Black Sheep of the Calhoun family.<br />When Isadora learns that Lily will sail to Rio with the ship and that Easterbrook desperately needs a Spanish translator (Isadora speaks 6 languages), she persuades Easterbrook to sign her on as translator, against Ryan's strongly expressed wishes. It is on this adventurous  voyage  that Isadora learns, from the most unexpected sources,  how to be a real lady.

Although she's happily settled into her home in the wilds of West Virginia, she's always looking over her shoulder. She fears not only repercussions from investigations she did in her old job, but revenge from the brother of her best friend's husband, whom she had shot when he ambushed them.<BR> <BR>When secretive Susan Rourke moves in nearby, then disappears, Zoe suspects she has been murdered. Handprints in dried bloodstains, a dented front door hanging by one hinge, a history of abuse by her husband Patrick --  all seem to confirm her suspicions. Then Patrick turns up dead.

That said, this book does have a great deal to offer.<br />It begins with a guide to using it, suggesting that you first read the articles and decide what you want from the book. Then it describes how to read the listings. That includes a key to reference icons that identify features unique to each listing. Like whether the agency is international, a new listing, Canadian, sells to e-publishers, or charges fees. Theres also an icon for agencies that handle only certain types of work, new agencies or those who are seeking new writers, or even those that accept only established writers. <br />Articles cover topics like Polishing Tips, Is Your Book Ready? Understanding Fees, Targeting and Hooking an Agent, Scam Alert, Outline and Synopsis Workshop, How To Find The Right Agent, Location vs. Representation: Is NY All That? and more. Theres an example of a successful query letter and a short article by the writer who sent it that is particularly illuminating.

Since then I've published hundreds of articles, short stories and poems and still I find myself taking this little volume down and re-reading it.<br />Eugenia Price wrote the introduction to my treasured paperback copy. That says a lot in itself, for she and Ruth Vaughn both write from the basis of Christian faith.<br />In her first paragraphs, Vaughn says that creative writing is valuable even if not one word ever reaches print. Over the years I've found that to be so, although when I first read it I didn't understand it. For the rest of the book, Vaughn plows through the basic essentials: the diary/journal, time, talent, prayer, notebook, the senses, compression and rules, figures of speech, sound effects, principles, the land, the challenge, then the writing of letters, writing with photos, writing meditations, writing poetry, free verse, greeting cards, writing for children and more.<br />The material is concise, yet all the basics are here. There are samples from her own writings and samples from her students. Open the book at random and select a passage, you'll find it useful and succinct. For example: &quot;Use words that express the impression made upon your senses,&quot; she writes. Then she goes on to provide a list of sensory words to make her point.<br />I've used this little book in every single creative writing course I've taught over the past 15 years. I recommend it to all who love writing, enjoy reading and who want to explore the craft and art of creative writing.	2002-07-01

The information he presents is solid, useful and timeless.<br />The book has 10 chapters. The first, Fiction and You, tells what the writer needs to know and gives common traps writers fall into. Then he discusses things like rules and the creative act of writing. His style is terse and sentences are short. That makes it easy to find specific information when you go back later to look for it.<br />In the second chapter he gets down to serious business -- words. How to find them, how to use them and make them clear and concise. The third chapter is all about feelings and how to use them. In the fourth he goes into the necessity for conflict, what to do and not to do in building it. Chapter Five presents the strategies of fiction. &quot;Fiction...&quot; he writes, &quot;creates an especially vivid vicarious tension...Your job as a writer is to control and manipulate this tension.&quot; He also delineates the source of story satisfaction and describes how to produce it.<br />Chapter 6 is all about getting a story started, lining up story elements, developing the middle of the story and winding it up. Story people and the importance of characters and character development are covered in Chapter 7. Planning the story, recognizing good story material, preparing to write, and what you need in order to succeed as a writer wind up the last few chapters. He devotes one page to marketing advice and that simply directs the reader to study the markets.<br />This is, without a doubt, one of the most useful and easiest to use books on the craft of writing that has ever been published.

It also explains a good deal of his theory as well as his outlook on writing fiction. That outlook is heavily influenced by Syd Field's classic theories of story development and script writing. At the moment, Kernan is developing projects for Web TV networks.<BR> <BR>It's always a pleasure to review a book by an author who clearly states his goals, then sets about methodically achieving them. In BUILDING BETTER PLOTS, Kernan makes three promises to his readers: <BR>     First, he'll introduce \\"tried-and-true\\" elements that make good plots and examine them in depth. <BR>     Second, he'll teach the reader to outline and how to \\"tinker\\" with a plot. <BR>     Third, he'll offer questions and exercises to keep readers focused and to give them insight into how to determine the strengths and weaknesses of their projects. Kernan accomplishes these goals with finesse by covering all aspects of plot and illustrating their functions with examples from a wide variety of novels and movies.<BR> <BR>In fact, he has put together one of the most insightful, practical and useful books I've ever seen on constructing a story. He begins with how to choose a subject and writes, \\"A plot isn't merely a string of occurrences; it is a carefully orchestrated telling of events that might include breaking up their temporal order.\\" He takes the reader through developing the story arc from the inciting incident through conflict to climax and resolution, all the time showing how to unify the project through devices like subplots and setting.<BR> <BR>BUILDING BETTER PLOTS is far more than a basic treatise on story construction. It is a complete and careful analysis of each element of story, and provides a series of useful exercises designed to make each plot a page-turner. You'll find fill-in questions, timelines and quizzes aimed at clarifying the focus of your plot. At the end of the book there's a comprehensive plot tutorial. All of this adds up to teaching readers how to keep the focus of the plot and how to stimulate story progression through a variety of plot devices including nonlinear structure and framing.<BR> <BR>The book is divided into three major sections: The Building Materials of Plot (with chapters on narrative, on structure, on the inciting incident,on  rising action and climax, and one on resolution); Building the Plot (chapters on archetypical plots, on creating characters and back story, on constructing an outline, on subplots, and also on deepening the story's resonance); ending with the aforementioned tutorial. <BR> <BR>Kernan is a great believer in using an outline and his explanation for why it's useful is most convincing. So, too, is his argument for using one. An outline \\"frees your mind and your intuition to work on the writing of your story, the characters, the dialogue, the language, etc., unconcerned about whether the construction is sound.\\" He convinced me; I tried his method, and it worked.<BR> <BR>My favorite quote (possibly because I've seen more book reviewer than writers forget it) is: \\"Every audience and author have an unspoken part. The reader agrees to suspend belief, to give the author a little flexibility with reality in return for good drama. The author accepts the audience's forbearance and promises not to abuse that suspension of belief.\\" His point here is that the author cannot afford to raise the story stakes too high but if you throw the reader a well-timed, well-aimed curve ball the reader will become more involved and more sympathetic.<BR> <BR>In a refreshing statement at the end, Kernan challenges his reader to master his techniques, then toss them aside. \\"Only your reader will be able to judge whether or not you've challenged them successfully or unsuccessfully,\\" he says. IF you work your way through this book, you'll find it time well spent and your stories as well as your readers will be well served.	2002-07-01

It's quite comprehensive. There's no way I can give you a complete overview of the questions he answers but you'll get some idea from the subjects. In Chapter 1 he begins at the beginning: \\"How do I get started in the business of writing?\\" Notice the question is not about starting to write, it's about the business. Rubie has answers for questions like what to do when you're staring at a blank computer screen and whether or not writer's groups are useful so it's not all business. <br />Chapter 2 is about genres. In it he explains what they are, why they matter, how writers meet reader's expectations and more. <br />Chapter 3 covers agents, editors and \\"publishing people\\" with detailed information on subjects like researching agents and editors, what they do, reading fees, organizations, Code of Ethics, agreements, editorial departments, art departments, subsidiary rights ad infinitum.<br />Chapter 4 discusses marketing, from your idea to the bookstore. What to do about time sensitive material, trends, what to do with a great idea.<br />Chapter 5 describes developing ideas and creating book proposals. This leads off with \\"What should I write about?\\" and covers bad ideas, \\"reader's needs,\\" exercises to develop ideas, writing different book proposals, structure, writing organizations, to name a few.<br />Chapter 6 gives you a good idea of how your book is developed from a manuscript from \\"what happens when I get an agent?\\" through subjects like what \\"well published\\" means and whether you need a lawyer. He talks about revisions, charts and illustrations, corrected manuscripts and finishing the book.<br />Chapter 7 has a lot of great information about how to read book contracts and what to do about them.<br />Chapter 8 discusses subrights and royalties pretty thoroughly and goes into sharing, selling foreign rights, returns and book scouts.<br />Chapter 9 is all about E-publishing and book packaging.<br />Chapter 10 covers writing and editing with discussions of things like rewriting, critiquing groups, structure in writing, \\"creative nonfiction,\\" author's voice, dramatization and lots more.<br />Lest you have the impression that Rubie's book is just for newcomers, let me assure you that the information he offers is thorough enough and detailed enough to be useful to anyone no matter how seasoned. These are the questions writers ask, and Rubie has the answers. <br />Peter Rubie has been an editor and a literary agent as well as a book reviewer and author of fiction and nonfiction. He is the president of the Peter Rubie Literary Agency in New York City. In Writer's Market FAQs, Rubie serves up the world of publishing in the clear, cold light of fact.	2002-07-01

Thanksgiving and Christmas and birthdays will come despite your best efforts to avoid them. And they are horrendous times for many years. Their pain cannot be minimized. But they still must be faced.&quot;<br />As a bereaved parent, Schiff's tender and upbeat treatment of this painful and sensitive subject makes her book a classic and lifts it far above others in the genre.

I love Gladys Taber's books.<br />In STILLMEADOW ROAD, Taber diaries life in her Connecticut farmhouse, circa 1960. Perhaps the charm of her books is in the simplicity of the life she describes. Perhaps it's in her delight in words as well as in her existence. Certainly it's in the phrasing she uses, the verbal portraits she paints of her life, her dogs, her friends. Here is warmth and love and charm in print. Here are simple vignettes to warm the reader's heart and challenge her to find the same delight in life wherever she may be.<br />&quot;We have an appointment with winter,&quot; she writes in the beginning, &quot;and we are ready. The wood is stacked with seasoned applewood and maple, the snow shovel leans at the back door, the shelves are jammed with supplies. When the first innocent flakes drift down, we put out more soot and fill the bird feeders. When the snow begins to come in all directions at once and the wind takes on a peculiar lonely cry, we pile more wood on the fire and hang the old iron soup kettle over it, browning the pot roast in diced salt pork and onion. As the blizzard increases, the old house seems to steady herself like a ship against a gale wind. . . Snow piles up against the windowpanes, sifts under the ancient sills, makes heaps of powdered pearl on the ancient oak floors. But the house is snug in the twilight of the snow and we sit by the fire and toast our toes feeling there is much to be said for winter after all.&quot;<br />Appreciation of life flows through these pages, sparkling with common sense and wisdom like wave-caps glistening in the sunlight of wise reasoning.<br />Of August she writes: &quot;For after the vigorous growth of the spring and summer, nature comes to a pause, and the countryside has a dreamy look. We need to pause, too, in the midst of pickling and canning and freezing, and let the serenity of the season give us tranquility...It is time to sit quietly in the shade of the apple trees...There is more to living than the endless activities we all pursue. Most of us indeed seem to live on a wheel which revolves faster and faster but has no true destination...But since we have just so much time alloted to us, some of it should be spent in reflecting, and some in pursuits which have nothing to do with our daily lives...because life isn't a business; it is a precious gift.&quot;<br />Gladys Taber's legacy is a celebration of life as she chose to live it. Her books are gems of poetic but light prose with depth, perception and feeling. The shallow and pseudo-sophisticated reader may label her &quot;sentimental&quot; but there is nothing idealistic or shallow about her writing. She simply lives and appreciates a simpler life than most choose.<br />STILLMEADOW is a book you can put away when life interferes with your reading and it's interesting enough to pull you back, eager to take up where you left off.	2002-06-30

I first read it when it came out in 1991 and it has been on the top of my favorites list ever since. I have also read it once a year since that first reading.<br />Interestingly, Hart provides a cast of characters -- names and descriptions -- at the beginning. From the very first the victim, Neil Bledsoe, proceeds to make himself thoroughly obnoxious. Leading characters are introduced, one at a time -- Victoria Shaw, Henny Brawley, Kathryn Honeycutt, John Border Stone... until we get to Annie Darling, who is the sleuth/protagonist. By this time the setting has been set, the battle lines drawn and the story is well underway. Hart has structured the story along the lines of Christie's work and she has provided well-rounded, distinctive characters to make the reader's experience an amusing and informative romp.<br />I love the references to Christie's books, her mentions of mysteries by other writers, Annie's ever-present watercolor competition in which her bookstore customers compete in recognizing paintings of famous mysteries, the last scene where all is revealed in classic Christie fashion . . .all these details combine to weave a contemporary tale into the traditional form and fascinate the reader.<br />If you're not a mystery fan you can learn a lot about the Dame of traditional mysteries from THE CHRISTIE CAPER and have great fun doing it.	2002-06-30

The situation begins to deteriorate immediately when it is obvious that he's expected to live and work in a dilapidated, run down chicken coop of a structure. His inquiries about his predecessor are met with evasion and soon it's obvious that he is being watched very carefully.  The pianos he has been hired to restore are not only is disrepair, it is obvious that they have been severely battered - victims of violence, as it were.<br />This was Noreen Gilpatrick's break into print. In it she proves a master of suspense. The book is a compelling read and one I highly recommend to mystery lovers.	2002-06-30

Knowing Lewis to be a man of deep faith and one of the most respected theologians of his day, secure in his beliefs, I was particularly interested in how he would react to such a soul-disemboweling blow. I was not disappointed -- like anyone else, he reeled. <br />In A GRIEF OBSERVED, his struggle to regain his balance, physically and spiritually, is not unlike my own.<br />Speaking of the grieving process he writes, &quot;At other times it feels like being mildly drunk, or concussed. There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me. I find it hard to take it in. It is so uninteresting. Yet I want others to be about me. I dread moments when the house is empty. If only they would talk to one another and not to me.&quot;<br />He struggles with anger as well as with the things people say to him. His faith is challenged -- he calls God the &quot;great iconoclast,&quot; and he speaks of his fears.<br />Lewis's rambling style is compatible with the confused and jumbled feelings of the bereaved. His anger, sense of bewilderment and suffocation along with recognition and acknowlegment of the feelings and emotions express the too-often inexpressable. <br />This book is a fine and sensitive treatise on the pain of grieving and the soul's journey through the grieving process. I recommend it highly to anyone deep in grief or who is concerned about someone who is grieving.	2002-06-30

Will is still grieving when his Grandpa Tweedy announces his plan to marry pretty Miss Love Simpson. Will's family and the town are scandalized -- poor Granny has been gone only three weeks!<br />With the loving acceptance of innocent youth, Will approves of his new grandmother. He likes her and he certainly likes the affect she has on his dear grandpa.

Some were better educated, some were more ambitious, but all were human beings caught up in a special time. In short, we begin to get the idea that these were average men who stepped forward to meet the destiny of a nation.<br />The evolution of Western thought had developed to a certain point and these were the men who tuned into that thought, picked it up, and ran with it. They were knowledgeable about history and they had the vision needed begin the creation. Of course they knew what they were doing. They just didn't know how long it would last. (&quot;What kind of government have you given us, Sir?&quot; &quot;A republic, Madam, if you can keep it.&quot;)<br />Perhaps modern writers are overdoing the fallible human being a bit -- even to the point of being inaccurate in certain cases --but they are certainly making the point.<br />Joseph Ellis brings us six stories that illustrate this point. The dinner at Thomas Jefferson's where the location of the capital city is decided sounds like a dinner party that might have been held at Katherine Graham's a century-and-a-half later. As you read this enchanting book, think of modern corollaries for each story.<br />That politics was carried on in a one-on-one manner in Colonial Times should be no surprise. Hasn't it always been that way in the USA? Isn't that the very crux of our political system? <br />It seems that modern writers and historians have suddenly discovered that history is about people rather than dusty dates. Hooray for authors like Joseph Ellis, David McCullough and Stephen Ambrose. They teach us that the legends of American history are men and women just like ourselves and the inferred lesson from this is that if they can do it, so can we. <br />Maybe now Americans will tune into the stories that made us great, learn about our history and develop visions of their own so that we can keep our greatness and expand on it.	2002-06-30

When Jazz Field meets the famous movie star Harry Noble, she is less than impressed. Nor is he impressed with her at first glance. But when Jazz -- a journalist -- auditions for the part of Elizabeth Bennett in an upcoming charity production of &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; he gives her the part of Elizabeth Bennett and casts the two on the path of this totally predictable tale. The story follows Jane Austen's original plot pretty closely, with comparable characters and subplots only slightly changed from the original. The reader can't help but be distracted by comparing characters to the originals -- Gilbert Valentine, for example, is obviously patterned on Austen's obsequious Mr. Collins and Dame Alexandra Marmaduke is the 21st Century Lady Catherine.<br />The deterioration of manners in the past two hundred years glares blatantly from the modern text. I found the use of curse words inappropriate and far too frequent, for I can't imagine Jane Austen using the 18th Century equivalent to &quot;bugger&quot; and other modern Brit lower-class colloquialisms. The modern edge to the main character (necessary in an age of &quot;in your face&quot; personalities)was extremely irritating since Austen's world of manners and sensitivities is far more appealing.<br />My overall impression of the book is that this was an exercise by someone who didn't have the imagination to dream up characters and plot on her own. I hope other authors -- and publishers -- don't resort to this kind of revisionism. It smacks of Hollywood's constant reprising (to the detriment of the original stories) of old movies. It doesn't work in literature any more than it does in film -- it's an exercise doomed to failure.<br />Authors: If you can't come up with original characters and plots, don't bother. <br />Sunnye Tiedemann	2002-06-29

When a certain lawyer from another town begins to come to dinner fairly often and the Lemon Jelly Cake becomes his favorite, Helene observes events through the innocent eyes of a carefree child.<br />This is an enchanting -- and sometimes hilarious -- story of small town life in a quieter, gentler age. At the same time the reader is reminded of the ever-so-human urge for excitement and passion in each person's life. <br />Skillfully written, sympathetically observed, the story progresses with an almost fearful inevitability. <br />It's a terrible shame that Madeline Babcock Smith didn't live long enough to write more books like this. Her skills at portraying delightful, enchanting and realistic characters and at executing one story while writing another are awesome.<br />THE LEMON JELLY CAKE is reminiscent of Jan Karon's Mitford series or Clarence Day's LIFE WITH FATHER/MOTHER books. <br />Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F.

In the hands of a truly gifted writer the reader can experience people, places and events that would never have touched him/her otherwise. Such is true of WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR.<br />In the New York of the 1950s when summer meant lazy days and baseball, and everyone met at the corner drugstore for ice cream sodas and egg creams, the entire world seemed to be either Yankee fans or Dodger fans. Goodwin's skillful portrayal of that world charms and fascinates. Hers was a happy and lively childhood filled with love of family and friends and The Brooklyn Dodgers. <br />Time must pass, though, and children must become adults. The end of Goodwin's childhood is marked by the death of her Mother and the removal of the Dodgers to Los Angeles in the late 1950s. She has captured the charm of the period, a period that looks innocent enough to us now but was fraught with danger and fear of the unknown at the time.<br />Although times change and the world evolves, memories keep a joyous past alive in the hearts that experienced it. What a blessing it is to us all that Goodwin can wield a mighty pen to bring her personal history along with the story of the gilded age of baseball alive for those of us who were blessed with other stories.<br />Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F.

With no real governmental power and, seemingly at least, nothing much to do, hers looked (to me on this side of the pond)like a totally useless life.<br />Lacey's book doesn't answer my questions but it does seem that although she may not have the power of the President of the United States, she wields a power of her own that is just as important to her people. This book, however, focuses more on the person and her life than on her job.<br />&quot;Lillibet&quot; dreamed of a quiet life with horses and dogs and what she got was life in the fishbowl of royalty with horses, dogs, Parliamentary boxes and public scrutiny. Luxury, yes, but luxury well earned in terms of personal sacrifice. Where others triumph and suffer the &quot;trials and tribulations&quot; of living in quiet peace, Queen Elizabeth experiences much the same under the unforgiving -- and often misunderstanding -- glare of fame. It is not an enviable position. <br />Robert Lacey has a number of impressive biographies in his repertoire (THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HENRY VIII, ROBERT, EARL OF ESSEX and SIR WALTER RALEIGH, to name a few) and his work is imminently readable. MONARCH, The Life and Reign of Elizabeth II is not only beautifully written and researched, it's downright fascinating in its portrayal of a woman touched by destiny and pride.

This \\"take\\" on Martha Stewart and her career is a fascinating read but it seems excessively eager to tear her down. She is obviously obsessed with success, a controlling and domineering personality -- but that's what it takes to build the kind of successful company that she has built. She's careful about details, she's a tough negotiator with her own interests foremost in her negotiations, she forges ahead.<br />She also is so self-absorbed that she has no manners. But isn't she a product of a generation that prides itself on looking after #1 and labels good manners as \\"old fashioned?\\"<br />Stewart's story is a sad one, of an emotionally abused childhood and of such obsession with perfection and her image as a successful businesswoman that she drives her husband to the arms of her assistant and alienates her only daughter. We see her on television as a very attractive woman who is knowledgeable about every detail of homemaking, yet she could not create a warm and lovely home for her own family.<br />That brings up the question -- what is success? If the answer is money in the bank, I suppose Martha Stewart is a success. If the answer is bringing laughter, joy and love to those who love you, she's a failure.<br />The book doesn't attempt to give a balanced point of view. Nor does it attempt to show whatever success she may have had in helping lead young homemakers (and even old ones) through the maze of \\"keeping house.\\" I would have preferred a more unbiased look at her life and the result of what she's achieved as it affects her family and friends as well as herself. Do her mother, nieces and nephews really enjoy being on her TV show or are they paraded out as cynically as the author would have us believe?

Full of side notes, this little book will be a welcome addition to the library of any dedicated Oklahomaphile.<br />A note that caught my attention (Harold Ross, the first editor of The New Yorker, once said that writers are very writer conscious) concerns Washington Irving. His trip to Oklahoma in 1932 is commemorated by two markers in the Sooner State. One marks his first campsite near old highway 66 in Arcadia. It was here that he hunted wild horses, and experience he recorded in his classic A TOUR ON THE PRAIRIES. The second marker is on US Highway 64, north of Bixby. The authors write, &quot;Because of Irving's visit to the area, an attempt was made at the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention to call the Tulsa area &quot;Irving&quot; in his honor.<br />There's a handy map in the back of the book, clearly keyed, to  help the reader locate quickly and easily points of interest.	2002-06-29

Immediately after we arrived home, Caroline fished a thick sealed envelope out of her suitcase and handed it to me, carefully, so that her fingers did not touch mine.<BR>'This is for you,'she said, not looking me in the eyes. 'It's from my mother.'<BR>'What in the world,' I said, and stared down at the envelope as if it were a toad. What Adelaide might want to send me was frighteningly beyond the reach of my imagination.<BR>'It's a list of foods we like to eat,' Caroline said.&quot;<br />It's not world-shaking fiction, which is probably why Thayer is not a major writer. But it is timely, warm and thoughtful. It is also a good story with characters the reader enjoys. Although step-parents and step-children may gain some insights through this book, it's still entertaining reading for those not involved in a similar situation.	2002-06-29

She is becoming sensitive to the interactions of the people around her. During the story she senses alienation between her parents and watches as her older brother becomes more and more attached to a young widow. The pangs and joys of first love enter her experience and she struggles to understand her bitter old grandmother.<br />Themes of love, tolerance and forgiveness give the book substance. Jen's brother, Luke, says to her, \\"Love isn't always safe. Sometimes it's hurt and risk and loss.\\"<br />Parents should use this book as a read-aloud instead of giving it to a child to read alone because the text raises questions that it doesn't answer satisfactorily. A discussion that Jen has with her grandmother expresses her anger at God. \\"Later, in St. John's, Jen's eyes lifted. . .She was confused by what she had learned that morning. Beliefs that had been instilled in her sice earliest childhood had been shaken. Gram challenged a rough God of Vengeance while Mama trusted a God of Love. Which one was right?\\"<br />It is the duty of parents to discuss such issues with their children and to guide them as they see fit. Whether it is responsible for an author to include theological questions that might possibly destroy a child's budding faith in a story book for children is something that should be considered. Parents should be warned that such content exists.	2002-06-29

In this large and fascinating volume we meet the minds that analyzed and chronicled the lives these women lived and observed. <br />One might argue about the selections included and excluded here. Pearl Buck, the only woman to win both a Nobel Prize (1938) and a Pulitzer (1932) is excluded.<br />The book is divided into 6 eras, each with a lengthy \\"period introduction\\" giving historical and thematic backgrounds for the works included in that section.<br />From the five earliest women writers (dating from 700 to 1600), women began to shape and define their literary voices. England's first professional woman writer, Aphra Behn, whose literary career began in 1670, is the writer who women must honor above all others. According to Virginia Woolf, \\"it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds.\\"<br />Here the reader will find rare works such as Jane Austen's \\"Love and Friendship\\" and George Eliot's \\"The Lifted Veil.\\" Three notable novels are included in their entirety: JANE EYRE by Charlotte Bronte, THE AWAKENING by Kate Chopin, and THE BLUEST EYE by Toni Morrison. <br />Poems, stories, memoirs, essays, plays, letters, novels -- all literary works originally composed in English -- over 150 authors decrying, exalting, agonizing over, and celebrating the things we all have in common: Life...love...and death.<br />This is a fascinating collection and one that will stand reading and re-reading over a long period of time.	2002-06-29

Catherine yearns for her second son, Henry, to gain the throne.<br />Passion, intrigue and murder -- what else would one expect from the infamous Borgias of Rome? Plaidy's style is entertaining and literate. She weaves history into stories with intricate plots. Characters who were once real people strut upon the literary stage expressing their feelings and frustrations, loves and hates. The reader experiences sights and sounds of a world long past, with voices of people who may or may not have spoken as Plaidy reports.<br />It really doesn't matter how much is fiction and how much is fact.

We began with the illustration on the front -- I showed them the photo of the soldiers raising the flag at Iwo Jima and told them what it meant. We talked about children raising the flag on the front of the book, then looked at the photo of the firefighters raising the flag at the ruins of the World Trade Center. Then we talked about symbols.<br />We have taken these pages in a somewhat disorganized fashion, definitely not in alphabetical order (even the 4-year-old knows his alphabet), but in the order raised by questions.<br />I have just one criticism, and that is that on the flag page, Mrs. Cheney skipped the first Colonial flag -- the one that had the British flag in place of the blue field of stars. Using that flag would have reinforced the fact that America became independent of Britain...but there are encyclopedias to use to show the children, which is what I did.<br />To say the text and illustrations are \\"sentimental\\" shows a distinct misunderstanding of sentimentality (or political bias) -- there is nothing emotional or shallow or even unfactual about the material that is presented here. This is the truth of America. We ARE (to the extent that human beings can be) all the ideals we aspire to and we are the only country in the world to set such lofty goals.<br />Our oldest grandson leaves this very day to begin his military career at West Point.

I get the feeling from Yeager's story that he has done just exactly that more than once.<br />Yeager was shot down over occupied France during WWII. He was hidden by the French Resistance who led him over the Pyrenees and sent him off to Spain, across the mountains on foot. He returned to his fighter squadron in England and stayed to fight again in French and German skies.<br />War over, he returned home, decorated and commended, to become a test pilot for the newly formed Air Force. Yeager is the pilot who broke the sound barrier, paving the way for supersonic flight and the space program.<br />This is a book full of wild tales and heroic deeds. Hilarity and tragedy, like in life, ride side by side.<br />\\"He loved practical jokes,\\" the authors write. \\"He went over to a little airport in Dayton and signed up for flying lessons. He took the course, taught by a really sharp-looking blonde, and when the time came for him to solo, a bunch of us went to watch. He took off, climbed above the field, then dove straight down, did a roll and barely missed the hangars, looped and spun, and turned everything loose.

I was fascinated to find that Adler and Van Doren have, in HOW TO READ A BOOK, clearly articulated what I had discovered on my own.<br />Most people read at an elementary level. Common print media -- newspapers, magazines -- are geared to this first level, that of eighth or ninth grade. Reading at this level is simple and unsophisticated. It is a fairly simple procedure. As someone once said, &quot;You just pick up a book and look at every word until you've seen them all.&quot;<br />The second level of reading is inspectional. Two steps are performed simultaneously. The reader skims, or pre-reads, by studying the title page, preface, table of contents, index, dust jacket and a chapter or two. He thumbs through the book, reading a bit here and there. Then he reads the entire book superficially without bothering whether he understands it or not. I might argue that if you don't understand what you're reading, you're not reading at all. However, this is the kind of reading I do when I'm selecting a book to review. It is just the beginning.<br />Adler and Van Doren argue that this kind of superficial reading can prepare a reader for enjoying more difficult works. &quot;The tremendous pleasure that can come from reading Shakespeare, for example, was spoiled for generations of high school students who were forced to go through 'Julius Caesar,''As You Like It,' or 'Hamlet' scene by scene, looking up all the strange words in a glossary and studying all the footnotes,&quot; write the authors. &quot;As a result, the never read a Shakespeare play. By the time they reached the end, they had forgotten the beginning and lost sight of the whole...They should have been encouraged to read the play at one sitting and discuss what they got out of that first quick reading. Only then would they have been ready to study the play carefully and closely because then they would have understood enough of it to learn more.&quot;<br />The book describes how to be an active reader. A clue for the average reader: Active readers don't go to sleep over books. The third level of reading is analytical reading, which is what book reviewers do. The reader classifies the book, reads it carefully, determines the author's message and evaluates how well it's presented and compares it to comparable works. <br />Adler and Van Doren cover subjects like classifying books, x-raying them, determining the author's message, how to criticize a book fairly, and the role of relevant experience in reading. They then go on to describe the different approaches to various kinds of reading -- practical books, imaginative literature, plays, stories, poems, history, science, mathematics, social sciences, and philosophy.<br />The highest level of reading, synoptical reading, is the reading of several books on a particular subject. They describe how to select a bibliography (which I found truly useful), how to narrow the subject, how to inspect the material. The five steps of synoptical reading are included in this chapter.<br />Reading is a search for truth, and truth can be found only through thoughtful comparison and discussion. &quot;The truth then, insofar as it can be found -- the solution to the problem, insofar as that is available to us -- consists rather in the ordered discussion itself than in any set of propositions or assertions about it...thus, in order to present this truth to our minds -- and to the minds of others -- we have to do more than merely ask and answer the questions. We have to ask them in a certain order, and be able to defend that order.&quot;<br />Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F. Tiedemann)	2002-06-28

It is obvious that these letters were not written for publication. They are as natural as conversation, as intimate as friendship and as warm as love. And they are tremendously fun to read.<br />One of my favorites concerns a statement that Mozart makes concerning the ease of difficulty in composing opera in German. In a letter dated February, 1783, Mozart writes to his father, &quot;I side with the German. I prefer it even if it costs me more trouble. Every nation has its own opera, why not Germany? Is not German as singable as French and English? Is it not more so than Russian?&quot;<br />&quot;Even if it costs me more trouble,&quot; he writes. Aha! says I. He admitted that it's more trouble to put the German language to music. Gotcha!<br />To those of us who love his music, Mozart is rendered in these pages, in his own words, just as we expect. I envy the reader who meets him the first time in this book, then approaches his music. It will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br />Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F. Tiedemann)	2002-06-28

His mother says it's because his Daddy does all the things that the daddy in the book does -- shops for dinner, plays batman, tickles and hides, and carries Teddy (in the story it's Corey) to bed.<br />There's no such thing as a book being too advanced to read to a small child. You adjust the story as you go along. And this is the greatest story, with a naturalness and charm that even adults will enjoy.<br />Sunnye Tiedemann	2002-06-28

Of course, she didn't promise to read them!<br />In MARYA, A LIFE, Oates attempts to fill that void. Marya is a portrait of a modern woman from a bewildered childhood to a womanhood that commands admiration, respect and love. She is a loner, bright and different from the people around her. She strives for self understanding and fulfillment.<br />Joyce Carol Oates is a meticulous storyteller and a vivid writer. I wonder if this is autobiographical. If so, the Woolf reference becomes irrelevant. Oates is definitely ordinary folk -- she is one of the finest and most recognized writers on the contemporary American literary scene.<br />But if you're in the mood for a book about a woman growing up and &quot;making it&quot; on her own, you'll enjoy this one.<br />Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F.

All through the rest of the book he interwove her story with that of her son, Wyoming geologist David Love and the geology of the Great Plains. When fan mail came rolling in, readers wanted to know more about the &quot;slim young woman&quot; who stepped down from a train in Rawlings, Wyoming one fall morning in 1905.<BR>LADY'S CHOICE is Ethel Waxham Love's story. Her granddaughters, Barbara Love and Frances Love Froidevaux, have collected her writings -- journals, letters, poetry, essays, stories -- present them in combination with letters from her friends and classmates as well as from the man she would marry.<br />Her story begins in the Fall of 1905. She has graduated from Wellesley and spent the Summer working as an assistant to her doctor father in Denver. When she gets the opportunity to teach in a log cabin schoolhouse in Wyoming, she accepts the offer. Her first journal entry describes her journey into the wilds of Wyoming by train, stage coach and wagon. With a sure pen and a sympathetic eye she records her impressions of the land, the people and events. Her observations are those of a sharp mind (she had earned a Phi Beta Kappa key at Wellesley, specializing in Greek, Latin and French), her descriptions are those of a major literary talent.<br />Of one acquaintance she writes, &quot;Mrs. Butler. . .is a little war-horse of a woman, with a long, thin husband. I'm telling you about her because she has been improving him for twenty years and it is beginning to tell on him.&quot;<br />Her year in this community is surprisingly eventful, considering the isolation and the seeming lack of resources. But Ethel is a resourceful person, full of imagination, the kind of person who makes things happen. She visits friends, attends church services and &quot;sociables,&quot; and dines in local restaurants. There are dances and suppers and school entertainments. And there is John Love, the man she will marry after the five-year courtship that is recorded here.<br />She is enchanted by her surroundings. &quot;The color of the white hills against the pale of the blue sky is most exquisite i the world. The cedars are gray with snow, the sagebrush white clumps of crystals. Where a long way off the sun touches the tops of the snow-covered hills there are shines a streak of silver. A whole white world was there, rising around us, as far as we could see; there did not appear to be such a thing as direction. Everywhere the whiteness, everywhere the hills. Where the stubble of the fields of the range rose above the snow,there was a shading of gold over the white. . .and when the full moon shines out of the deep dark night sky, the hills are like shining silver.&quot;<br />You, too, will find a lady to love in these pages. Her journal begins as she stands on the threshold of her life, emerging from the chrysalis of a protected girlhood toward the challenge of womanhood. Here she records a land, a people, a life, a love, welcoming them as unequivocably and eagerly as only the young do.<br />LADY'S CHOICE eclipses others of its type. It not only showcases the lady's life and the choices she made, it reveals a true literary talent and a rare human being. Wallace Stegner (ANGLE OF REPOSE, SPECTATOR BIRD, CROSSING TO SAFETY)once spoke of the &quot;inextinguishable western hope&quot; expressed by writers of history as they look at the world and at humanity's place in it. Ethel Waxham Love's letters and journals provide a major contribution to that hope as well as to the history and the the belles lettres of the American West.<br />(c)2002 Sunnye Tiedemann<BR>(Ruth F.

Saxbe's agile esprit punctures pomposity with glee, which makes his autobiography such an amusing page-turner.  The story of his rich and lengthy political career presents a uniquely compelling look at one special man's unstinting service to his country and the time in which he lived.<br />Co-author Peter D. Franklin, whose previous books have raised corporate biography to new heights of readability, has captured the incomparable Saxbe at his sapient best in a book that will keep you chuckling to the very end.	2000-11-28

A dear cousin gave me this album as a &quot;bread and butter&quot; gift, so I promptly began to fill it with mementos of our mutual family. About halfway through, I decided to order another to create a memory book of my  45-year-old marriage, so I ordered another. I guess that proves how much I  like it.<br />RECOLLECTIONS: A SCRAPBOOK AND GUIDE FOR CREATING YOUR OWN  FAMILY ALBUM is more than a box with a book full of blank pages. It does  include a cloth-bound book of 100 archival-quality pages, and a box for  treasures ( beautifully decorated with collages from Sallyann Murphey's  book THE METCALF FAMILY ALBUM), but it's the booklet full of instructions  and ideas for creating a truly valuable family memento that makes the all  the difference.  If you enjoyed the Metcalf book, here's your chance to  create something similar for your heirs.<br />&quot;The kit is designed,&quot;  author Murphey writes, &quot;to help recapture some of the treasures of our  heritage.&quot; Then she proceeds to show you just how to do that, as well  as how to select material and fill in missing pieces of your story. She  guides you through the process not only with design suggestions, but with  explicit directions on which materials are safe and which aren't. I found  the section on rescuing old albums especially informative and  useful!<br />Murphey helps the scrapbooker get organized, then tells how to  put the resulting puzzle together. She gives web addresses for genealogical  research and makes constructive suggestions on how to interview  relatives.She even addresses subjects like how to balance the page when   you're putting the pieces together, using color to unify the project, and  suggests a basic tool kit of items you need to create your  masterpiece.<br />Page by page she leads you, through mats and frames and  handling pressed flowers to photo cropping, creating collages and how to  write the memories that go with the pictures and mementos.<br />When you've  finished you'll have gained a lot of confidence, had a merry time doing it,  and be ready to start another.	2000-06-21

Even if you've kept scrapbooks and albums for years, as I have, Sallyann Murphey's album and box will be a welcome addition to your collections. It comes as a large scrapbook filled with blank pages (100 of them, all  archival quality) in a beautifully decorated box. There's also a booklet --  32 pages of suggestions of ways to put your own memories together.<br />I  received mine as a gift from a newly-found cousin. I am putting it together  as a collection of the part of the family that I share with her, It begins  with our mutual grandfather (several generations back) and once it arrives  in the present, I'll continue it as that part of our history  unfolds.<br />I've ordered another to put together for my marriage. That one  will begin with our wedding and, like the first album, I'll add to it as  the years unfold. I suspect I'll order others once these two are well  underway.<br />The reasons I'll select RECOLLECTIONS over others? First, the  size of the memory album --it's perfect for photos and memorabilia. Second,  Murphey's booklet, which is included and is full of information and  inspiration. The booklet begins with an introduction in which Murphey  describes her motivation for presenting the album in this form as well as  ways it can be used. She goes on to describe how to catalogue, organize,  protect, store and preserve your treasures. Then she gives tips on how to  fill in gaps you encounter and how to reconstruct the past with  &quot;less-than-perfect&quot; evidence.<br />As you continue, you encounter  suggestions on how to set up your workstation with tools and techniques to  make your own album special. Then there are suggestions about written  entries, including the selection of narrative details to add life to your  family history.<br />As you proceed, you'll learn about proper album storage  and find ideas for future books and finally,  you'll find a section on  resources -- where to get books, kits and other materials for your family  archiving.<br />If you're contemplating buying RECOLLECTIONS either for  yourself or as a gift for a friend, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Of course &quot;it's what you do with what you got,&quot; but if you follow  Murphey's suggestions, what you'll get is a real treasure.	2000-06-18

With subject matter as dry as this, business biographies  are traditionally yawners. Not so ON YOUR SIDE.  In it, author Peter  Franklin has managed to write a book that glues the reader happily to the  page with vivid descriptions and clear prose. ON YOUR SIDE presents  fascinating, larger-than-life characters charting new ground as they build  one of America's most progressive insurance companies. Anecdotes about  these creative and forward-thinking pioneers spice nearly every page.         The story begins in the Roaring 20s with Nationwide's founder, Murray  Lincoln, a visionary Farm Bureau secretary who considered selling life  insurance to farmers and wound up selling them automobile insurance  instead. From one employee -- Ezra Anstaett, also the first policy holder  -- the company  &quot;mushroomed&quot; into a giant conglomerate dabbling  in a variety of businesses, from broadcasting to grocery stores, worldwide.   John Fisher,  George Dunlap, Dean Jeffers -- the people who guided it  along the way are unforgettable and their successes as well as some of  their mistakes make lively reading.  Sixteen pages of photographs  illustrate major players and major events.     ON YOUR SIDE stands out from  the world of business books as positively as its subject dominates the  insurance one. You'll learn a lot about how to and how not to run a  business when you read this one; and you'll enjoy every word.	2000-06-04

The experience the protagonist encounters is  harsh and painful and the author has recorded it honestly.  Can a reviewer be less honest?   Polish expatriate Dr. Teddy, lonely and suffering the cold of a New York winter (&quot;too much like Poland,&quot; he realizes), dreams of tropical climes, love, lust, and Rosie, whom he knew in Warsaw. He plans, he dreams, he works.  And finally, full of high expectations and glorying in his freedom, he meets his Rosie in Mexico. In their lusty celebration, Teddy finds reality.    Life is often painful and crude, and cruel to our expectations...and FIG TREE is a faithful reproduction of the way love can disappoint and how life has to be lived -- by picking up the pieces and doing our best with what's left.  The honesty of the book is a great part of its charm, and that honesty is bittersweet.   Be prepared for a lusty read, but look beyond the carnal pleasures to the celebration of life and love and freedom that is lying under the fig trees	1997-09-05
