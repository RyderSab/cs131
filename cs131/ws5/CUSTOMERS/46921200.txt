I agree and it is also very misleading. The characters in the book do not even resemble those guys - the main character's love interest is an artist who looks nothing like the clean cut characters on the book jacket. <br /> <br />Things we can do without in gay fiction from now on: <br /> <br />1. A spoiled egotistical self indulgent main character. Yes this may apply to some gay guys but its just BORING now in the books. <br /> <br />2. A distant disapproving father and eccentric mother. YAWN <br /> <br />3. The flamboyant gay friend (usually black)  <br /> <br />First this book starts as a character study - will this selfish debt ridden loser get his act together? - then it morphs into some sort of romance (never worth your time) - then has a whole chapters about the running of an escort service (fairly interesting) and ends with a kind or frenetic black humor. It never gels. <br /> <br />I kept waiting for the big romance and it was incredibly lame. Was my heart supposed to be warmed about him doing threesomes with his new boyfriend and a client???? <br /> <br />If you want a real book about running and escort agency read the MAYFLOWER MADAM's book. At least it's interesting. <br /> <br />If you HAVE to read a book about a selfish gay man - I recommend \\"California Screaming\\" and forget this trash. <br /> <br />	2005-10-05

From the horrific working conditions of the women, the lack of respect from the unions and utter denial of management each page makes you madder than the next. <br /> <br />Then pile on top of it the lengthy courtroom battle, a truly evil judge (almost someone from Dickens) and a trial as horrific as the abuse itself you just root for Lois all through the book. <br /> <br />It also exceeds your expectations because it also shows how women can be each other's \\"worst enemy\\" in the workforce. Working against one another instead of supporting each other. The other women are victims but also vitimizers of Lois for taking a stand. <br /> <br />Lois' story shows how being a whistleblower can ruin your whole life. Financially, emotionally and healthwise. Doing the right thing for the future but ruining your own life is truly something that only martyrs do. Everyone who makes a difference in this world pays some kind of price for it. That is surely shown in this story. <br /> <br />I highly recommend! <br />	2005-08-23

Ruth Gordon was a great actress and one of the best \\"characters\\" ever to grace the silver screen. You would assume an autobiography would be filled with funny stories from her life but this book is nothing like that. This HUGE uninteresting book is filled with names, names, names and more names of people you have never heard of. No explanation about who they are or distiguishing features about them. It would only be of interest to people who actually know these people. <br /> <br />I'm pretty well versed in Broadway and Hollywood history and even I didn't know who or what she was talking about most of the time. <br /> <br />This was an autobiography her friends might enjoy reading (cause they know the people) but for everyone else this is just a long drawn our series of names and uninteresting stories. <br /> <br />I forced myself to keep reading this until I got to the Hollywood section and even then when I knew the names the storytelling was just as bad. <br /> <br />Skip this book! <br /> <br />	2005-06-02

It is told from a child's perspective like Angela's Ashes without all the suffering. She really gets to the heart of what it is like to be a kid and to come from a small midwestern town. I laughed out loud all through the book and it really was heartwarming in a non-saccharine way. As some readers pointed out some of the descriptions of animals being killed was hard to take but that is reality in a farm community. <br /> <br />I would definately recommend reading this book...wonderful.	2004-12-03

Whenever the character of Louis enters the scene the book grinds to a halt. I almost put it down but I was 60% through it so made myself finish. <br /> <br />The last 25% is fairly interesting (when the \\"storm\\" finally arrives) however it is not worth much once you get there. <br /> <br />Plus the teacher is a 35 year old in love with a 14 year old boy. Something really grossed me out about it. Even worse when there is a whole story about him stalking a kid on vacation with his parents. Follows him into the bathroom. Maybe NAMBLA members understand this stuff but I thought it was gross. <br /> <br />I think gay people have it hard enough without romaticized tales of child molestation. eww[...] What was this author thinking? <br /> <br />Then one of his most interesting characters (Louis' wife) does NOTHING throughout the entire book. <br /> <br />None of the characters take an emotional journey, none of them learn anything (except maybe Louis to appreciate his wife) and there was really no point to this. <br /> <br />What were these other people reading???

This book has a compelling main character, an interesting setting and the fact that it's told in a Sk8board language compelling - however as a story it really meanders and you wonder when something is really gonna happen here.<br /><br />Finally when it has a story it is something really unbelievable. Think of Dickens style coincidences or something from a bad late night soap opera.<br /><br />This was a tough book to get through and when it was over I was sorry I wasted my time.<br /><br />I think the author is good at coming up with characters but he needs to give them a story. Even a simple coming of age story would have been better than nothing.<br /><br />Read Permanent Midnight or Dry instead.	2004-09-20

When this author talks about the making of the film and the interviews with people who worked on it this is fascinating. However halfway through the book he sabotages it by writing as if Sunset Boulevard was the greatest thing ever put on film (it's not) or the best piece or literature ever created. (again..not) He actually gives sunset boulevard credit for inspiring ever other film, play or book ever written. Waaaaayyy too carried away. <br /> <br />Yes it's true that the lines of dialogue and Norma Desmond imagary has had a big impact on our popular culture. He could have just explained this but listing quotes or examples for a few pages was excruciatingly boring. <br /> <br />I wanted to stop reading it at that point. Fortunately the part about the musical (and all that drama) was next so it was worth getting through. <br /> <br />This author obviously loves film and certainly \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" and \\"All About Eve\\" are classics that are unequaled especially for their writing. However someone should have told this author when reverence becomes obsession. Couldn't they convince him to edit this???? <br /> <br />I hope his next novel isn't \\"The Poseidon Adventure: More important than the Bible\\" or something! <br />	2004-09-14

Some were so frightening it was like a suspense book. Others were endearing.<br />At times I wished I were there with him and at others so glad I was not.<br />Definately a fun read but also deeper than that. His chapter on going to France with his brother is more about the loss of their father and not being able to &quot;go back home&quot; again than about food. There are lots of chapters with similar hidden themes about life and human nature.<br />Pick this one up!	2004-06-23

I don't think it is fair to compare the two as others are doing. The topics are so different and the perspective is too.<br />I thought the tone was hilarious and disturbing which was the whole point of his book. He is not asking for sympathy, just poiting out all the bad things about addiction on personal relationships, work and life in general. Told with great humor and sarcasm.<br />I love how he balanced making fun of self help groups while also acknowledging how incredibly important they are. Some things about therapy can seem silly but it is the end result that counts.<br />Another great book (about drug abuse not rehab) that is also told with great humor and is even better than &quot;DRY&quot; is PERMANENT MIDNIGHT by Jerry Stahl. I would read that if you liked DRY.	2004-03-29

The fact that this offbeat family functioned the way it did being led by a phsyciatrist is amazing.<br />The author lampoons this family while also embracing them and their lunacy. <br />It must be hard to have your main parent be mentally ill. The anger and amazement at his mother's behavior come through with great sypmathy & satire.<br />I found it funny and disturbing at the same time. (cruelty to animals, fecal matter - things I find hard to read about)<br />Not as good as PERMANENT MIDNIGHT by Jerry Stahl (another humorous book about an unfunny subject) or as well written as ANGELA's ASHES (Humrous childhood look at starvation).<br />I would recommend if you like offbeat humor in your autobiographies.	2004-02-20

I didn't think Dan could surpass his wonderful book \\"The Kid\\" but this book does or is at least it's equal.<br />Congratultions to Dan for writing such a hilarious book that also points out the many hypocrasies in modern american life.<br />He deftly celebrates and satarizes his subjects from swingers, to big people and the gay pride attendees. <br />What he expects to find at these events and what he finds are sometimes 2 different things. His journeys are very interesting and enlightening.<br />It is amazing how the 'virtuecrats' as Dan calls them, have such a huge political and vocal influence in our country when most Americans don't agree with them on a fundamental level.

Most stars of his generation and age usually die before it is talked about openly. (Think Raymond Burr) It is great he feels comfortable enough to &quot;come out&quot; and I applaud him.<br />This book, however, is totally misrepresented by the description on the book jacket and even on this website. This is NOT a book full of information on Richard's career and experiences. This is really a new age self help book about how to get over being angry with your family and being at peace with yourself.<br />Due to the fact that Richard fills every chapeter with his ruminations on love, sense of self and spirituality the true stories of his life never get explained. Everything in his life is still at &quot;arm's length&quot; for the reader.<br />For example he tells how much he loves Martin but never really explains in detail how they met, how it felt to fall in love, the details of their romance or potential problems. You don't get any sense of who Martin is at all. I got more info looking at his picture in the book than anything Richard says.<br />Richard has worked with so many interesting people and legends it was unfortunate he shares so litte of it all. All he says about the &quot;Thorn Birds&quot; is really that Rachel Ward is lovely and Barbra Stanwyck a hard worker. Less info than I would get from an issue of People magazine.<br />I definately think that if you are looking for a new age spirituality book or trying to deal with getting over a bad family situation this book could be helful. For everyone else who wants to read an autobiography I would skip this book. <br />I respect Richard and the fact he came out but I wish he would have spent more time talking about his life and less about the beautiful scenery and/or his spirituality.<br />He used to have a &quot;mask&quot; hiding behind his straight leading man image. Now he is using the &quot;mask&quot; of new age dogma to again reveal very little of who he is.	2004-01-21

It does a good job showing how ridiculous it is to work there.<br />The narrator is so self effacing through the whole thing he makes his jabs at others easy to take. <br />Toby tries to make us feel sorry for his alienation in NYC and with women. However since he wants to be with a supermodel, be friends with celebrities and be with the \\"in\\" crowd this feels false. Anyone would probably feel left out if that was their goal. (Unless they were rich, incredibly good looking or had \\"made it\\" in that world)<br />He also wants us to feel sorry for his bad luck with women but he loses his audience when he practically admits all he wants is a woman with big breasts. Not a relationship or a connection with someone.<br />His bitter critique of NYC and America compared to Britain also rings false because he is only seeing things from being \\"left out\\" of this A-list group. He didn't try to really find real friends or connections in the city. He just tried to get into A-list events and parties.<br />It's true that this unreal world deserves to be critisized and the case he makes about publicists ruling the magazines is VERY convincing. <br />A good read but seems like it was written as revenge for being fired and for never being allowed \\"in\\" to the A-list crowd he so desperately was seeking.	2003-12-29

He is self effacing while sharing these intimate details of his life. He is humorous, not jokey and writes extremely well.<br />I was pulled into his tale and really enjoyed every minute of it even though this is a horror story of sorts.

When you read a book about such a pathetic character you want to see a couple things. Either a story about overcoming such obstacles or have it written in a way that makes it some sort of parody or social satire. This is neither.<br />All I felt was contempt from this author for his main character.<br />Looking at the picture of the author I find it even more insulting. This is a good looking man who wrote an entire book making fun of an ugly boy. I'm sure that was not the intention but that is how it comes off.<br />Skip this book.

He really makes you picture the times, places and characters in his life. Especially strong is the evil Doctor at the hospital and his wonderful uncle in New York City. (Edmund White) These characters and moments really stand out.<br />However most of this book just rambles about and then ends with no purpose whatsoever. At the end I wondered \\"why did he write it\\" and \\"why did I read it?\\".  I would not recommend this book because it just meanders and ends with no explanation. I need more of a story arc even from a biography.<br />The other thing that puzzled me was why he would paint such a wonderful loving tribute to his uncle and then ruin it by mentioning an offhand sexual advance by his uncle. It seemed out of place never explored his feelings behind it or why it was even mentioned. It was kind of unsavory without a reason for it.<br />Keith needed a good editor on this book and some guidance.	2003-12-02

Meaning that there was something very fascinating about this read.<br />However I found this book extremely disturbing on many levels. First of all this author never ever found out what Lucy was really like or even who she really was. All he does is play games with her (at her request) and idolize her. <br />He compares everything that happens to her in real life to an &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episode. Which was not only boring to read but very very disturbing.<br />He gets momentos from her (framed pictures) and sits around watching old &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; reruns while looking at the scripts while Lucy looks on. This is beyond creepy.<br />The whole thing reminded me of MISERY - except Lucy was the one in control. Sort of MISERY in reverse. <br />We never really get to know about Lee or his boyfriend. (Except they are rich) We only hear tabloid style mean jabs at Lucy's husband - very unfair because that is the ONLY way he got to know Lucy at all.<br />It's sad when the only thing good about this book is the letter written by Lucie Arnaz to the author. It is such a sincere and nice letter. Much better than this fawning strange book.<br />It was nice to see that Lucy had a soft sentimental as well as tough side. As Lucie Anaz put it she was &quot;only human&quot;.<br />Fascinating but gross!	2003-12-02

The adventures he has & famous people he meets just by being good looking are astonishing. This is kind of a gay \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" with the young gay character seeing and experiencing all that a big city has to offer a cute young gay man. <br />James is not a likable character in the book and he honestly doesn't try to be. Some of his observations are predjudiced, self loathing and narcissistic however they were his \\"truth\\" as he lived it. <br />This story ends abruptly and feels unfinished. Partially because that is the truth when you die so young. However it is also because he really never accepts his faults or gains compassion for others. (despite one story depicting it)<br />The foreward gives away too much but the afterword is essential to put Jame's story in perspective. <br />CALIFORNIA SCREAMING is a much funnier and livlier book on this same topic - altho it is fiction.<br />I would recommend this only if you are a big fan of autobiography or you want to see young gay glitterati in NYC during the 70's.

I think Bills promises to people are unrealistic and wish he would just concentrate on getting people in the best shape of their lives and not having fake pictures or testimonials with the book. <br />also as many have noted here - once you are doing this it is all about pushing the products that his company sells. After comparing several different brands I chose UltraMet a brand I liked much better. <br />I would suggest that people take the diet and exercise information from this book. Dump the supplements and don't even look at the fake before and after photos.<br />Bill got his body from steroids - it is obvious from the Frankenstein forehead he has. He has nerve trying to pretend that HE got his body this way. He didn't.<br />GO FOR IT!  But be aware of the lie as well.	2002-04-17

I try to read every SAVAGE LOVE column in my local alternative paper and I love his columns in gay periodicals. <br />I was shocked that the tone of this book was more serious than i expected and I have to admit being a little concerned about Dan's reasons for adopting. I.E. A hobby and to get fat etc. but he does make the point that straight couples often have babies totally on accident for no reason whatsoever. <br />Then I really was into the book learning all about the intricate adoption process and by the time there was a birth mother in the story I was hooked.<br />Then I started laughing along with Dan and by the end of the book tears were streaming down my face. Lots of em.<br />I did not expect to be touched by something written by Dan. I highly highly recommend this book!<br />For the negative comments left by other readers - One of them obviously didn't read the book and is just homophobic and the other tries to make the point that gays break up alot so they shouldn't adopt. Shouldn't this person push for gay marriage then? How can you blame us for breaking up when we don't have the support of our families, church or community that you do through marriage. Give me a break.<br />READ THIS BOOK! LOVE YOU DAN!	2002-02-01

When he is giving his thoughts and observations on history his writing also sparkles.<br />His words on his mother are so bitter but I found it hilarious. <br />When he tries very hard to explain locations and rattles off dates and names of people ony interesting to him this book is boring. I almost put it down but I am glad I didn't because towards the end some great dish awaits.<br />I was touched by his longing for his lost love and he is humorous enough to forgive his high opinion of himself.
