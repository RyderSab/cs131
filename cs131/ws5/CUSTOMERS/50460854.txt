I'm a native English speaker, and I've dabbled in German, Spanish and Japanese, but I still think that Mandarin is the easiest language I've ever learned. It is a straightforward, simple, flexible and consistent language with no surprises. The tones are not that hard to learn; there are basically only four of them, and you learn them by experience and practice, and by HEARING and REMEMBERING them, not by memorizing. All in all a very well-done and polished production. According to the Amazon release date, Mandarin III should be out February 2003; can't wait! I also hope they do a fourth level, like they have with the German and Spanish.	2002-08-08

Something cruel and inhuman and immoral worked into the narrative. That aside, it is really quite a boring book. There is very little sex, hetero anyway. Beauty hardly gets any. Most of the hardcore action deals with the male slaves only, especially the horrific ordeal of Prince Alexi. It is as if Anne Rice was afraid of pushing the envelope for fear it may offend her own sensibilities and other women readers. I see this same consideration in her vampire novels and Exit to Eden. My other complain is that Rice seems to me to have very little talent for description. She may have a great imagination but the literary skill for describing scenes visually and realistically does not seem present. For example she would describe intercourse as someone just sticking it in, but a better writer would have delved into how it felt, what it looked like, the sounds the participants made, and so on. There is no irony or anything particularly striking about her prose. I am not a great reader but in recalling books by Updike and Styron, I could almost smell the sex as if I was the same room.	2001-10-27

The only distinction is this book includes some material on SS activity in France, but only a tiny bit. Despite the title, there is actually very little detail about the Gestapo. Like the other books on the SS, the narrative is mostly just a listing of familiar names and dates and events rather than a full-blown account. The translation from the original French is very good however; the prose style sparkles.	2001-10-13

Unfortunately it is very bare of the details that make profoundly understandable the SS as a fascinatingly evil and real organization. For example ranks are not explained or delved into, nor the structure of this paramilitary organization, and there is practically nothing of the way they lived and worked. For example I wanted a look into Prinz Albertstrasse where the Gestapo was based, but I got not a glimpse. Also there are important events in SS history that were quickly summarized and passed over, like Heydrich's assassination. Overall this is a dry book filled with mundane details that in the light of its deficiencies seem like padding, but, unlike Shirer, Hohne is a much more lucid writer.	2001-10-04

I have always been attracted to the elegance and clarity of the German language, but I never thought that learning it for the first time could be so pleasurable and easy as it had been. The speakers are warm and lucid, the script is very efficient and very logical, and the whole package has a playful and pleasing quality to it. I cannot rave enough about the speakers. They are genuinely attractive, and their flirty bantering imbues this production with a pleasant and humorous atmosphere missing from most other foreign language programs, which are usually flat. Also most of the lessons are under 25 minutes and easily zipped through.	2001-09-26

So far I can tell you that Japanese is a much harder language to learn. The Pimsleur method makes it somewhat easier but there are flaws with the lessons and with the performance of the speakers. For example, the speakers do not ALWAYS breakdown each word syllable by syllable--which they do most of the time and are supposed to do all the time. To compound that, I feel the speakers were often talking too fast, and being deliberate about it. I realize that Japanese is spoken fast, but a beginner is not going to learn a language if the speakers insist on frustrating him. The learner has to learn as a small child does--with kid gloves. Another thing is that the female speaker often pronounces words markedly different from the male speaker. I often had to resort to a dictionary just to make sense of what she said. One last thing: the female speaker is often annoying and affected. Well, onward to Japanese 2. You really have no choice.	2001-09-07

Chinese people always look at me as if I am weird, since I have an accent. But now after finishing this Pimsleur course, I have a hard-wired Mandarin vocabulary of over 200 words. It is amazing how with the Pimsleur method one retains completely what one learns. Now I don't even mentally &quot;translate&quot; from English to Chinese, but think natively in Chinese. I can pretty much get by in Chinatown and make very small talk with other Chinese people. The only drawback to this extremely valuable program is that there is as yet no second course. Other languages like Spanish have four levels, but there is still no Mandarin 2. I have written to an editor at Simon and Schuster and he claims that Mandarin 2 should be out by this summer, and Mandarin 3 in the near future. I hope so. Life after Pimsleur is kind of worrisome. I really wish to continue learning and since I am so astonished with the results I have been able to achieve with this program I am wary of other Mandarin programs. I hope that Mandarin 2 does come out this summer so that I don't have to resort to other programs.	2001-05-11

The narrative and prose is impeccably crafted, the characters sharply realistic, the drama believable and ringing, and the horror has the lingering, unforgettable power of an EC Comics denouement. I have not read everything King has written since then, but it seems to me &quot;Pet Semarary&quot; was a watershed in his career. In latter and recent years he seems to have lost or neglected his great gift for scaring the daylights out of us. These days he seems to be writing way too much, writing way too much in the first person, writing way too much science fiction and fantasy, and forgetting that horror, real horror fiction was what he was great at. I believe that &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; was King's last great work of original, unpretentious horror (even though the premise was lifted from the W.W. Jacob's story).	2001-05-11

Technically this novel is brilliant; not a single line in it is muddled. Every character was sharply crafted and London has never been more vividly described. I have often heard Hemingway labeled as the century's first great prose stylist, but how could anyone forget Conrad? The only flaw with this book to me was the overuse of foreshadowing; too much was given away too early in the story only to be revealed much later when the reader's patience may have already been exhausted and leading to a winded effect; but the flaws are inconsequential considering Conrad's accomplishment. Many reviewers here claim this book was boring but I think they only need read Conrad's prose slowly, savor and visualize it, and realize it is one of the great works of the twentieth century.	2001-05-02

It started off very exciting and interesting, Hitler's background and Vienna days and the formative years of the party were fascinating, but starting with the party's rise to power and with it EVERY twist and turn about how they intrigued and bullied their way to the top and then the occupation of Austria and Czechoslovakia it became excruciating and suffocating to wade through. Characters appear and vanish with breathtaking rapidity never to be heard from again, or else hang around for hundreds of pages (especially Schleicher and Dahlerus) and won't go away. This book's pious and mindboggling coverage of basically only the political events comes at the expense of details about other aspects of the Third Reich (like the Ss, Gestapo, Hitler Youth, Heydrich, Speer, exactly how Germany rearmed, etc.). For example, did we really need a blow-by-blow account of every single turn and setback and last minute comeback and every trivial detail (complete with date, time and even weather descriptions!) regarding how these gangsters came to power? So often I threw up my hands and tore at my hair and screamed as I kept reading about how so and so telephoned so and so at 2 a.m. in the morning then waited all day for a reply... or how many times Hitler flew into the absolutely worst rage in his life... it was sickening enough reading about how dirty and slimy Nazi politics had been but to have every minor character unearthed and every trivial detail thrown a spotlight on through virtually all of 1500 pages including huge footnotes--the footnotes may as well have been a separate book!--it was all just too much. And Ribbentrop, whom Shirer sneered endlessly at is on practically every page in the last two thirds. If he was so pompous and intolerable, did every item in his daily itinerary really needed scrutiny? I'm not exaggerating. Except for Hitler, Ribbentrop is the leading character in the narrative; as a result, more fascinating people like Heydrich and Rommel were given short shrift. Even a little more on Himmler--heck, Streicher--may not have hurt and may have tendered the endless monotony of diplomacy and backstabbing and squabbling. I guess what I am trying to say is that if this book had been a little more well-rounded, it might have been better. I realize one could read other books for more information about other characters and events, but I really wanted it all from this book. After all it has the all-encompassing title of &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; and everyone claims it the definitive history of those days. Also, Shirer has an annoying tendency for Monday morning quarterbacking, and his personal phobias mars the seriousness of this book somewhat. Also, his prose style is distracting and ebbs as much as it flows. The acute sections on the Holocaust and the July plot however were very worthwhile.  Overall, three stars.

I don't get the sense that he is much appreciated for his technical prowess, but he should be. If only critics will realize that great art is first brilliant craftsmanship, I think the quality of literature, in general, would be much higher. The things I liked about this book are the vivid descriptions of plantation and rural life (you could almost smell the soap on Margaret Whitehead's skin), the often hilarious speech, the shocking violence, and the staggering hypocrisy of the people of the American South with regards to chattel slavery. The biggest thing I did not like about this book (also with Sophie's Choice) is the clipped, elliptical narrative. It was often confusing to follow. I believe &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; would have been a more powerful book if its storyline had been linear. But in the end, this is a great book. Much better than Sophie's Choice in my opinion.	2001-02-11

Xavier March, the 'asocial,' is an exceedingly likeable hero. His ally, the American journalist Charlotte Maguire, is equally attractive. Their amusing banter and growing love for each other forms much of the heart and conscience of the story.

Both of these pathetic stories climax with eye-rollingly laughable showdowns, one involving licorice and the other a pair of Polaroid cameras duking it out, so to speak. For crying out loud, when is Stephen King going to realize that Coke machines and Polaroid cameras are NOT terrifying?	2000-12-10

His prose is crystal clear, his craft virtuoso. His characters, however ugly, are utterly compelling and tragic. There was simply no stopping them. They would hang on to their delusions even if it destroys them. And then there are the people with no hope whatsoever, existing just for surface pleasure and materialism. Tod, the 'artist', tries to help these people, and nearly goes mad with frustration. West's compassion for these people (cloaked by his biting sarcasm and wit) makes this book a great work of art. It, like O'Connor's &quot;Wise Blood,&quot; are among the masterpieces of American fiction. Read it and be ennobled.	2000-10-19

The first part with Hubert Ward conniving the people around him to make ends meet and his growing stardom in the theatre were all electrifying--O'Hara at his very best--but it all goes downhill after that. First of all, O'Hara writes in exposition in the beginning and in the epilogue that Ward was a heel, but I never got that impression throughout the narrative, and Ward even came off as rather honest, blunt, and down-to-earth. Second of all, his marriage to Nina Stephens was absolutely unbelievable; and I think O'Hara may have been reading a little too much Hemingway; some of the dialog between Ward and Nina were starkly reminiscent of several early Hemingway novels. And there were even two suicides, AGAIN recalling Gatsby. Overall, &quot;The Big Laugh&quot; is substandard O'Hara, but a pleasurable quick read utterly without pretension and profundity. As usual, O'Hara wrote brilliantly and never wrought a boring line of prose, and he was a speed reader's dream come true.	2000-09-22

Now that I've just finished &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot;, I may well skip the rest. This book was excruciating. First of all, Hassy Angstrom is an utterly worthless character. I don't care whether he's 'profoundly understandable' or not, or that he represents most middle-American men--he's a lowlife. I cannot undestand what some of the characters saw in him, especially Ruth and Eccles the minister, because all he did was poison everyone around him. This book was like watching Married With Children, but without the laughs. Second, I've about had it with Updike's prose style. I just wish he would write clean lines and quit cluttering it up with metaphors that don't work. I found myself re-reading sentences over and over again and just not getting them. Some of the stream-of-consciousness passages were extremely aggravating to read. I'm sorry if grammar and punctuation are in the way of great art, but you have to use a friggin' comma to separate some of your clauses now and then unless you want to wear down the eyes of your reader. And lastly, Updike the 'over-a-Cheever' should maybe start reconsidering an old idol of his. Here's a quote, Mr. Updike: &quot;If I am writing narrative prose, and I sometimes am, I must content myself with these limitations. Every line cannot be a cry from the heart, cut in stone. But I do rebel against common speech, against the quality of filler I find in my work...&quot;. In other words, cut out all the unnecessary filler in your books. You needn't preserve all of life, or an era, in your work.	2000-09-21

However, I had several problems with this book. First, the story was very contrived, with many elements ripped off from The Manchurian Candidate. The  plot was usually tedious and predictable, and often infuriatingly  unoriginal; i.e. dead characters that keep coming back to life, or  characters explaining things that should have been resolved by the  narrative. Second, all the characters were poorly developed. The main  character, Joanna Rand we only see as a victim and not as a fully realized  human being we might root for. The love interest and detective, Alex  Hunter, does nothing but sleep with Joanna and feel sorry for her, and  there is nothing special about him that would clue us to why Joanna loves  him--even though she keeps saying she does. Third, Koontz's supposedly  visual prose style is static and mundane, sometimes unbalanced, and on more  than just a few occasions, ungrammatical to the point of being unreadable.  Finally, some of the violence done to the women characters were plain  offensive. This is not a bad book, but you would not want to read it  straight on say a long flight. It is best read over a few days, so you can  put it down instead of having your patience tested, or your interest  constantly straying.	2000-06-06

The first masterpiece in this collection is  &quot;Over the River and Through the Wood&quot; that must be one of the  most disturbing stories ever written. It is disgusting to me that not a  single O'Hara story was included in the recent &quot;Best American Short  Stories of the Century&quot;; if a claim can be made that Hemingway,  Faulkner and Fitzgerald must be included, then so must O'Hara.

Everyone here seems to celebrate Dickey's prose as poetic, but I thought it was as a whole sloppy and rambling and unbalanced. The  descriptions of the river and the cliffs were nearly impossible to  visualize for anyone who has never been outdoors. I found the twenty pages  of Ed Gentry climbing the face of a cliff so excruciating that I wanted to  put the book down. City readers should see the movie first or else they  would be completely lost.

It is like reading Sade today; and you read either just for the gratuitous descriptions; and if you must read either then you put  yourself alike with pederasts and snuff enthusiasts. Besides, this book was  utterly unrealistic and incredibly boring. Ellis was acting out his  fantasies in prose (consider the tiresome accounts of cnlingus that  permeates all his books), and the readers who championed his  fantasies--sadly both male AND women--needed a fictional monster to cherish  and model their own fantasies after. In our society today, even serial  killers have groupies; and the popularity of this book reflects that  pathological mindset. You know, Hitler had his followers; and those who  would have followed Hitler then are today substituting with Patrick  Bateman. Also, why is it that anytime someone posts a negative review, all  of the &quot;groupies&quot; of this book automatically claim it was not  helpful?	2000-04-13

When he is uninspired or just writing filler, his prose becomes monotonous and nearly unreadable.  Brett and Cohn were the best-drawn characters while most of the others,  including Jake, were nothing more than cardboards. However, the one fishing  scene was absolutely vivid; there is no one better at writing about fishing  than Hemingway.

While much of this book is excellent, its flaws are jarringly obvious. There are plot holes galore, characters  who inexplicably appear and then are never heard from again, and so much  detail that it just boggles the mind. I suspect that when O'Hara sat down  to write this book, he just started typing whatever came to his mind, and  without consideration for structure, grammar, or punctuation. After he was  finished, he sent it off to his publisher and no one, including O'Hara,  knew how to edit it. I've read several of his short stories and they  suffered from these same flaws. He is, however, a matchless winner when it  comes to writing dialogue; all of his characters are distinctly real in the  way they talk. Alas, sometimes, I wonder what ever happened to John O'Hara;  he was one of the literary lights of the first half of this century, but he  is largely forgotten today.	2000-03-17

This was the work of a potent imagination, on par with the elite of horror literature (The Haunting of Hill House, Dracula, Rebecca, The Body  Snatchers). Sure, the writing's a little crude at times--as crude as say,  To Kill A Mockingbird--but Andrew's skillful imagination more than makes up  for it. She writes significantly better in the fluffy sequel.	2000-01-14
