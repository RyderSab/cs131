He sees leftists around every bend, which is odd since there are only about 3 of them in the entire nation.  However, in America, as in all nations, there are a fair number of people born gay, and Gallagher feels quite strongly that they should not be accorded the most basic civil rights.  He never explains why not; he just seems to think it's enough to say that he's opposed to it.  <br /> <br />And he has the nerve to say HE is the one surrounded by idiots! <br /> <br />Of course, he devotes great energy to saying that he's not prejudiced in spite of his prejudice, much like the slave owner who used to brag about how well she treated her slaves:  \\"Why, OF COURSE they don't REALLY want EQUAL rights...\\" <br /> <br />And Gallagher has the nerve to say that HE is the one surrounded by idiots! <br /> <br />Gallagher quotes the lovely and homophobic Senator Rick Santorum at great length, suggesting that legal recognition of gay marriages will surely lead us licketty split to legalizing marriages between Uncle Pete and his hound dog Spot, as well as to bigamy, incest, adultery, and polygamy.  It's all nonsense, of course, yet he loves using this as evidence that withholding equal rights from his fellow citizens is somehow bizarrely justified.  Gallagher clearly has no clue of what he is talking about, and doesn't bother to search for any facts.   <br /> <br />Gallagher calls his own marriage the \\"single best gift God has ever given to me,\\" yet manages to think it's fine that he withhold that gift from gay citizens.  Utter hypocrisy. <br /> <br />Buy this book if Ann Coulter, coloring books, or other fact-free books turn you on.   <br /> <br />	2005-10-07

It is a silly conceit of a book, and writers are far better served by many other books on the subject. <br /> <br />Points made by See, in a sea of obnoxious \\"humour,\\" are so obvious that if you NEED this advice, you are probably not going to succeed as a writer anyway.  Carolyn See lacks creativity in her suggestions and has little to say to anyone who has given this more than a passing thought already.   <br /> <br />I am unsure why the publisher even bothered to print this book.	2005-09-23

Most disappointing of all is the author's ill-conceived attempt to deny that James Dean was gay or bisexual.  Gehring goes to frankly ridiculous lengths to deny the now-well-known fact that Dean was not heterosexual.  When the author refuses to recognize such a central, basic fact of a person, how can he write a useful, believable biography of him?   <br /> <br />Readers seeking a biography of James Dean would be better served by books such as \\"James Dean\\" by George Perry, which has been authorized by the Dean family.  The definitive biography of Dean has yet to be written, I believe, but in the meantime, the George Perry book is fine.  \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is also worth a look, though those who refuse to believe that anyone they like is gay will no doubt close their hearts and minds to that one.  Some pointless, unfounded prejudices die hard in some people, it seems.   <br /> <br />James Dean remains an important cultural icon worldwide, and it is my hope that a better biography will be written one day.  Since he died so young, this is a difficult project. But you can definitely by-pass the Wes Gehring attempt. <br /> <br />	2005-08-28

I had no idea Lynde led such a fascinating life.   <br /> <br />The book follows Lynde's life from start to finish, but focuses primarily on his performances, and the behind-the-scenes activities that took place while he was working on projects such as \\"Bye Bye Birdie,\\" \\"Hollywood Squares,\\" \\"Bewitched,\\" etc.   <br /> <br />There are many happy surprises in this book.  For example, I had no idea he had been very close friends with Cloris Leachman and Charlotte Rae (Mrs Garrett on \\"Facts of Life\\") since they were students together at Northwestern University.  What makes this book absolutely fascinating to all is the word-for-word tales of things that happened in his life, as told by people who were there.  It is like being there. <br /> <br />I think this will be the definitive biography of Lynde, and every library should have a copy of this book about one of America's most important entertainers.	2005-08-27

He writes in an authoritative and readable fashion, such that Bible classes can make excellent use of his writings. <br /> <br />As Rev. Mel White said, \\"You can read the Bible literally, or you can read it seriously.\\"  Rev. Spong reads it seriously.  No one can claim to have a clue about Biblical interpretation until they have read the works of Bishop Spong.

You can see the bias a mile away.  And you can assume that anyone who would write such a thing has no actual facts to back up anything he says. <br /> <br />Much like Ann Coulter's famous footnotes, which refer to nothing and allow her to create Potemkin Demons in her mind, Goldberg's villains are not villified in any credible way that could be taken seriously by anyone seeking actual facts and information. Goldberg is just writing silliness much like a first grader who will make up anything to prove that he deserves an ice cream cone. <br /> <br />There can be little doubt that one day teachers will examine the books of Goldberg and Ann Coulter in classrooms to demonstrate how easily an unscrupulous writer can demonize even the best people our country has ever created, much like the Nazis managed to convince Germans to hate all Jews, gays, and Slavs.   <br /> <br />Goldberg clearly finds anyone who has the tiniest difference of opinion with Karl Rove to be below contempt... or at least that is what he writes, so he can make money exploiting easy money from those who prefer to have others think for them.  Buy this book if you want others to create a Universe for you in which all woes can be easily attributed to hard-working citizens who have the audacity to attempt to create a world of love instead of a world of hate and profit for a select few.	2005-07-23

It's hard to imagine a book that offers less help and more misinformation and lies than this one. <br /> <br />Ms. Browder refuses to recognize that there is not ONE single scientifically proven case of any gay person ever changing to straight, or vice versa.  It has never happened.  And yet she encourages people to continue living in this ludicrous mindset (believing that people can change sexual orientations) which put her in the situation of marrying a gay man in the first place. <br /> <br />She encourages people to take on yet MORE heartache by believing that people can change sexual orientations.  And she encourages a heinous vilification of gays, quoting a lunatic who says that gays are \\"killing our children\\"!  This is scandalously irresponsible of her.  No, it is criminal.  It is criminal, absurd, a lie, un-Christian, and an abomination.  You can not say such a contemptible thing in a book and just let it slide.  Comments like this are what kill people and destroy lives. <br /> <br />She has the nerve to condemn the brilliant and compassionate Bishop Gene Robinson, as if she is some Biblical scholar herself.  Excuse me, but anyone who can read ANY of the Bible and walk away from it thinking that it justifies hatred of God's children is beyond contempt.  She actually says that gays can be \\"delivered from\\" homosexuality.  She never tells me what I should want to be delivered from, and I would like to know, because it is clear to me that I have led a far more Christian life than she has.   <br /> <br />Anyone who actually wants to LEARN something and grow in Christian love is advised to turn to Amity Pierce Buxton's \\"The Other Side of the Closet,\\" which is written specifically for women who find that their husbands are gay.   Or try Carol Grever's \\"My Husband is Gay: A Survivor's Guide.\\"  They take a realistic approach to healing and learning from the experience.  They offer HELP to the woman.   <br /> <br />Browder's book is a total waste of time, and a sad testament to the fact that some people go through life's trials without learning one little thing.  Without growing.  Without learning real compassion. And without learning to see past the lies and hatreds that they have been taught. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-15

I quickly found at least one very erroneous statement in it.  The book states that Pope John Paul I was a centrist and \\"was probably not going to be an innovator.\\"  Anyone who knows ANYTHING about Pope John Paul I knows that this is a totally absurd (and unimaginable) assessment of the man.  A poll in Italy showed that many millions of Italians believe he was killed by someone in the Vatican precisely because Pope John Paul I was so revolutionary in his ideas about birth control, poverty, and the church's irresponsible dehumanization of gay people.  Pope John Paul I was set to be the greatest innovator in the history of the Catholic church.  So this book lost all credibility with me upon reading such an apparently intentionally misleading statement. <br /> <br />	2005-05-24

It is 100% off-the-wall, unsubstantiated hate-mongering of the sort promoted by Nazi Germany.  So it is ironic that Mr. Weiner would spend his life working to destroy the lives of good people.  I guess self-hatred explains it; perhaps those letters to Allen Ginsberg from Weiner explain a lot. Any way you explain it, it is sad that Americans would waste their time on such negativity and vulgarity. <br /> <br />Rather than look upon his fellow Americans as teammates, he chooses to dehumanize any who is even slightly different from him (or from what he claims to be).  This sort of divisiveness is counterproductive and pointless, but apparently he is more concerned with convincing himself that he is great than in actually finding solutions to the ills of our society.  Better we should just whine and snip and throw hissy fits at everyone than do the real work involved to make things better...that's the \\"Savage\\" way.	2005-03-14

If there aren't tango dances or classes taking place in your town now, get ready: they will be there soon! The tango is on MTV, in new movies, and young people worldwide are discovering that it is the best way to have fun, meet people, and be incredibly beautiful and sexy all at once! <br /> <br />So who knew that you could combine the tango with meditation? It seems that not only can you do so, but even Buddha himself practiced meditation while walking. Zen meditation can be practiced in more active ways than the sitting posture. Chan Park says \\"One can meditate while dancing Tango, experiencing deeper appreciation of physical, emotional, and even spiritual aspects of inner-self.\\" You know those books that offer a new idea whose time has come? This may well be one of them. Tango zen is such a beautiful concept that it is bound to catch on. <br /> <br />This book includes a bit on Zen philosophy as well as well-illustrated exercises which should help any beginner to get started. It is a small book, but it contains all you need to learn this fascinating new meditation/dance technique - and the book can be easily held in the hand while learning to do the exercises. It does not attempt to give extensive instruction on all tango moves.  <br /> <br />Anyone can benefit from this technique, and Chan Park's book is highly recommended. Personally, I would be very happy to see our parks full of people doing tango meditation together! What a civilized sight that would be! <br /> <br />	2004-12-10

An excellent text to accompany the Oliver Stone movie, \\"Alexander,\\" this book is astonishingly well-researched and written by Michael Alvear with assistance from Vicky Shecter, who is now working on a children's book about Alexander the Great. <br /> <br />If you laugh out loud at David Sedaris books, this book may remind you of what a serious ancient history book would be like if David Sedaris had written it.  It is a laugh a minute.  Yet, the basic facts provided are correct.  This book just makes it FUN to learn a bit of history that most people (even in Greece!) know far too little about. <br /> <br />I am a public librarian, and have read at least 12 books on Alexander the Great in the past six months.  What one inevitably finds when researching Alexander is that his life is hotly debated by many differing factions:  Should he be called Macedonian or Greek?  Should he be called bisexual or gay?  Should he be hailed as a hero and liberator or condemned as a mass murderer?  Was he buried in Alexandria or someplace else? Did he have a part in killing his father or not?  You can forget about finding a book that makes EVERYONE happy, though the best overall book I have found is Robin Lane Fox's \\"Alexander the Great\\" published in 1986 by Penguin Books.  I believe it stands head and shoulders over any other book on Alexander, and every public library MUST have that book.  Oliver Stone chose Robin Lane Fox to be his historical consultant for the film \\"Alexander.\\"  I would avoid the new book by Paul Cartledge even though it is new;  the Robin Lane Fox book simply covers so much more and does it so much better.  Also, the account of Alexander's travels by Arrian is a must. <br /> <br />Every library needs sources on Alexander, however, for those who may not care to read the serious history texts. Mary Renault's \\"Persian Boy\\" is outstanding for fiction readers, and her other books on Alexander, especially \\"The Nature of Alexander,\\" are also excellent.  But for those who want to really have FUN as they learn their history, you just can't beat Michael Alvear's \\"Alexander the Fabulous.\\" <br /> <br />Anyone who is terribly homophobic may not like this book, but then again, anyone who is terribly homophobic is not likely to be reading about Alexander the Great anyway.  After Jesus Christ, Alexander may be the most influential human to ever live, and there should be as many books about his life in our libraries as possible.  The fact that he was gay or bisexual should not be a reason for not providing a book about his extraordinary life.  <br /> <br />Don't miss this great book!  You will be ever so glad you found it!	2004-11-18

Don't waste your time or money.  Instead, get Robin Lane Fox's \\"Alexander the Great,\\" which is generally agreed to be THE great book about Alexander. And if you prefer fiction, go to Mary Renault's books about Alexander, such as \\"The Persian Boy.\\"  Renault's \\"The Nature of Alexander\\" is an outstanding nonfiction title on Alexander as well.   <br /> <br />If you want to read about Alexander and have FUN while doing it, try \\"Alexander the Fabulous\\" by Michael Alvear, which is an amazingly humorous yet well-researched book.  It makes learning ancient history fun and relevant to today's readers. <br /> <br />There are quite a few BAD books out there about Alexander the Great.  Stick with Robin Lane Fox and Mary Renault to get the highest calibre of research and the most thorough coverage of his life.  Then go for Arrian's account of Alexander for the best classical text on him.  And wind it all up with some laughs as you read the Michael Alvear book!  Then you'll be ready to go see Oliver Stone's \\"Alexander,\\" and you'll be the most qualified person on your block to discuss it afterwards.	2004-11-18

This book captures the thoughts of two men falling in love, and as such it should help heterosexuals to understand that our love is the same as theirs.  Our marriages are the same as theirs.  We have about a THOUSAND obstacles to overcome which heterosexuals do NOT have to confront, so it is a miracle that any of our love stories have happy endings.  Some do, this one didn't.  But it still shows two beautiful and wonderful people who fearlessly plunged into the treacherous waters of love.  Love is always difficult, but when you have the entire world against your love, it is at once more magnificent and far more difficult to maintain.  This book should be read by EVERYONE.    A young (...)man interviewed recently by the Washington Post said he wished he could be straight so he could marry and have a long-lasting love like straight couples do.  This poor kid had never seen a loving (...)couple on television or in a book. What does this say about our representation of (...)men in the media?  They are not showing the true, full story.  This book shows a bit of the untold story.  (...)men DO have love stories just like straight couples.  And some have marriages that last more than 50 years, just like straight couples.  It is tragic that our (...)youth are never shown this by America's homophobic media, which won't even allow Will Truman of \\"Will & Grace\\" to have a date or a kiss on TV.  Every public library needs this book to show these kids that love knows no sexual orientation.	2004-10-11

Once you get past the outrageous cover of this book, it doesn't take long to realize you were snookered.

You decide. <br /> <br />I read this book cover to cover and found nothing but a very imaginative writer twisting every fact of Jimmy Carter's existence since 1924 made to sound like he was a power-mad thug anxious to undermine all that is good in the world.  I think Carter should sigh a huge sigh of relief, because no one on earth is going to buy this nonsense.  It is unsubstantiated and so absurd as to be merely laughable.  Carter is not perfect, nor has he ever claimed to be, but he is an undeniably good man who has at least TRIED to make American politics sane and moral. Of course, such outrageous intentions make you an inevitable victim of slander by America's ultra-conservative media elite. <br /> <br />If you are naive enough to believe that Carter is responsible for terrorism today, not the Reagan & Bush administration giving millions of arms and millions of dollars to the Taliban or the Reagan/Bush support of oppressive dictatorships in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, then by all means, buy this ill-conceived and silly little book.

But she lost a little credibility to me with her comments about James Buchanan.  Ms. Holland rather cluelessly maintains that Buchanan was not gay, while the evidence is overwhelmingly clear that he was.  It concerned me that she would make such an erroneous judgement without knowing the facts.  Buchanan lived with Rufus Devane King for over 20 years, yet Holland thinks that just because Buchanan once asked a woman to marry him, he was straight.  She evidently never considered that virtually all gay men prior to the current generation asked women to marry them, and almost all married as well.  The Buchanan-Rufus King relationship was no secret to anyone... Even Andrew Jackson, James Polk, and Dolley Madison referred to King as Buchanan's spouse, and the fanatical Sarah Knox Polk hatefully refused to let her nieces and nephews come in contact with Buchanan because he was gay -  folks then harbored Falwellian notions about all gay people, though they did not have the concept of \\"gay persons\\" in their vocabularies yet.  Ms. Holland further revealed her cluelessness when, at a book talk, she asked an audience member \\"How did they know he was homosexual? Did he wear a dress?\\"  This kind of insulting and absurd comment does not speak well for the author, who is clearly unaware that only a tiny percentage of gay men have ever donned any kind of female attire, and that, in fact, straight men are far, far more likely to wear a dress than gay men are.  Making such a comment is akin to asking about a black person with the question \\"How did you know he was black?  Did he tap dance?\\"  It's an unbelievable insult and it casts a shadow over the legitimacy of her book.<br />Nevertheless, I think this is a worthwhile book. But take it with a grain of salt.  Historians, please do more of this kind of book, so that our children will finally learn their history.  History is incredibly interesting indeed if only teachers will tell the truth.  And do their research.	2003-02-17

Allan Metcalf has done American culture a great service by writing this book!  What a great joy to read.  The book may bring back memories of words-gone-by, and is sure to entertain readers of any age.  It should be required reading for all students... it would certainly make learning far more interesting and entertaining for students. I strongly encourage all public and academic libraries to buy at least two copies of this book.  Bravo!	2002-11-11

Libraries should be required to stock multiple copies of this book because their patrons will adore it.  If you are one who laughs out loud at David Sedaris' hilarious books, or if you are one who has had enough of hypocritical Puritans dispensing useless advice (which even they do not follow in real life), this is the book for you.<br />Dan Savage makes a remarkably convincing case for the value and NEED to simply enjoy ourselves.   Behind the laugh-out-loud humor, Savage presents some very real truths which Americans desperately need to hear today.   No one is spared or given the politically-correct treatment.  Savage tells it like it is a-la-Dr. Phil in some of his better moments.  Very refreshing, and morally sound.  At last someone has some SANE ideas about why America is the way it is.<br />Bravo to Mr. Savage!  I believe any living soul with a brain will adore this book.	2002-10-15

He attacks the church for practicing love.<br />Mr. Rose's agenda is clear.  He wants to dehumanize gay persons, simple as that, and he wants to promote his own political agenda, making it appear unreligious to not share his ideas.  His obsession with trying to convince people that all gays are \\"evil\\" is downright ludicrous and pathetic.<br />We can do without such poorly-supported, obviously biased and hate-based books.  Where is the Christianity??	2002-09-22

If you buy this concept, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd love to sell to you.<br />The author conveniently manages to neglect to mention that only .03% of all child molestations are by gay men.  That leaves 99.7% by heterosexual men.  Instead of wasting his time trying to make gays into the scapegoat for the irresponsibility of the Catholic church (which still treats gays as fourth class citizens, by the way), the author should be writing a book about all the horrors which the church has caused for gays Catholics and their families.  But evidently the Inquisition has begun again, and this time the Ultimate Scapegoat is gays.  Not one word is said about the countless Protestant ministers caught molesting young girls ..., and not one word is said about the great good done by those priests who are gay.  Perhaps the author never heard of Father Mychal Judge, one of the heroes of September 11.<br />Buy this book so you can have a copy of the most absurb and preposterous piece of garbage and hate printed since the days of Adolf Hitler...	2002-07-06

He bases his criticisms on his pathetically out-dated and scientifically disproven belief that gay people choose to be gay.  Evidently he wants gay men to marry his daughters, since he allows no other options for gay men in his world.  This book is little but empty-headed ranting, scape-goating, and spreading of unfounded myths.  To see the basis of this foolishness, readers would do well to see David Brock's \\"Blinded by the Right,\\" which reminds us that William Bennett once called Rush Limbaugh \\"possibly our greatest living American.\\"  <br />The happiest families in America, with the warmest hearths, are those that reject Bennett's demagoguery, ignorance, and hatred disguised as morality.	2002-03-27

There are some points to be made about changes in western civilization which should be examined.  Unfortunately, Buchanan's book is nothing but a silly rant against all the groups he enjoys dehumanizing. Every other sentence seems to be a ridiculous attack on gay people, which I foud nauseating.  Buchanan is oddly obsessed with gay people, as if we are some kind of demons trying to destroy the world.   It is a total waste of time, and a sad commentary on the state of scholarship in this country.	2002-03-27
