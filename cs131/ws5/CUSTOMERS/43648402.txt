So much, that I have reread all of her books several times.  What excitement it was for me to pick up THE FLEDGLING.<br /><br />A whole new genre for Ms. Butler, but one that she has mastered with her usual flare and style.  I never thought I could get into Vampire fiction, but Ms. Butler has made me a convert.  She gives humanity to these non-humans (as she has done in all of her books that deal with another species), giving them vulnerabilities, prejudices, wisdom and a whole lot of sexuality.<br /><br />I hope that this story is only the beginning.  Shori's story shouldn't end and hopefully, Ms. Butler will try her hand yet again in this genre that she has easily made her own.	2005-10-06

In Ms. Due's current book, JOPLIN'S GHOST, she does another masterful job of making the supernatural seem plausible and leaves readers wondering if those bumps in the night are really \\"just\\" their imagination.<br /><br />Phoenix is an incredible character.  She is strong yet vulnerable and through her eyes, we get to see Scott Joplin in all of his perfections and his flaws.  Scott Joplin dies of syphillus and the way Ms. Due weaves in reality with \\"unreality\\" one is left in the uncomfortable position of trying to figure out what reality truly is.<br /><br />There is a line where Mr. Joplin asks Freddie/Phoenix is she really there and if he is mad.  She tells him yes he is mad and yes she is there.  To me, that line challenges the age-old question of what is real and what isn't.  Is reality what exists in each individuals mind or is it something that must be shared collectively.<br /><br />I'm not sure if those answers are given, or even if they need to be, but I will say this book is one of my favorites of Ms. Dues.  Her writing only gets better and better with time.	2005-10-06

The intricately woven story of an alternate universe where Africans were the slaveowners of European Americans is mindboggling in its presentation.  Through the stories of the young Kai and his slave/friend, Aidan, the reader is emersed into a saga that is both enlightening and unforgettable in its portrayal of the &quot;what if&quot; factor.<br />Barnes attempts the impossible and more than surpasses all expectations I had for the epic.  LION'S BLOOD and ZULA HEART are two must haves for any Barnes/Sci-Fi fans.	2004-06-16

Some daring writer had actually tackled the impossible--posing a &quot;what if&quot; question and fully embellishing it into a novel that transcends &quot;so-called&quot; true history.  There was never a moment when the story felt implausible.  It smacked of realism to a point where the reader almost felt as if she had been transported into an alternate universe.<br />Barnes illustrated more effectively then any college survey course could have hoped to that the thing that causes history to move in one direction or another is miniscule.  Barnes did more than just flip the script.  He looked at the psyche of Africans and wrote a work of fiction that challenged and entertained the reader.  THis book should be a required reading in history courses.  It would make for quite an interesting discourse.	2004-06-16

He is strong, intelligent, sexy, but most of all, determined to protect his woman and all of the women around him.  Once again, Pearl Cleage gifts her reader's with a strong, electrifying black male character.  He is Prince Charming wrapped up in nubian wrapping paper.<br />The story flows and moves with a fluidity that is only surpassed by the strong dialogue and the extremely believable characters.  Even though Blue and other males in the book represent what many of us would like to see among our \\"menfolk\\" Cleage leaves hope for the reader that this doesn't have to be fiction.  She leaves the door open for her readers to believe that real men do exist and are just waiting to be the men that they can be.

Too often, the only stories we hear are those of oppression, depression and repression.  Bessie and Sadie proved that you define your circumstances, rather than your circumstances defining you.<br />They proved that intelligence and determination can overcome many of the societal barriers that were put into place to keep black people down.  They were a close, tightknit family who supported each other and other people who were interested in surviving and striving for success.<br />It is sad that these are not the stories that we hear more.  Black people are descendents of Kings and Queens, yet the stories that pervade our consciousness are of poverty and despair.<br />Every young black person should read this historical account of black people making it through a time in our history when the odds were against us yet like the Pheonix, we continue to rise!<br />P.S.

Jill Nelson wrote an honest critique of the experience that many African American women go through when trying to attain the proverbial golden rings in corporate America.  I am sorry some folks could not relate or understand Ms. Nelson's book because the points she brings up are true and still reflective of the socialogical culture most African Americans live in today--approximately twenty years later.  The patriarchal blindness that many in this culture experience that prevents them from understanding or relating to another individual or cultures experiences is sad yet expected  The best that Ms. Nelson and other writers like her can do is just tell the story and let those who get &quot;it&quot; get it.<br />Were some of her experiences hard to hear?  Most definitely.  Were the experiences unique to her?  Absolutely not.  Ms. Nelson says on in chapter 2, that she has been doing the standard Negro balancing act which is &quot;blurring the edges of [her] being so that they [white people] don't feel intimidated.&quot;  There are few African Americans, I would venture to guess, who haven't experienced this feeling at one time or another, yet it is virtually impossible to communicate this experience in a way that is understandable to someone who hasn't had to always be &quot;aware&quot; of how they are perceived and how those perceptions can affect other African Americans as well.  Ms. Nelson does an excellent job explaining these details and if some people are still clueless, well, it's through no fault of her skill as a writer.<br />Keep on shedding a spotlight on these issues Ms. Nelson.  There are a few out there who are truly looking for the light.	2003-02-04

Her prose in SAPPHIRE'S GRAVE puts one in the mind of Toni Morrison's BELOVED.  Like Dr. Morrison, Hilda Gurley-Highgate becomes a lyrical poet when she turns a phrase.  In some ways, that strength seems to also be the weekness in the book.  I desperately wanted to gain further insight into the many generations of strong black women that were introduced in this novel, but the overuse of lyricism and the abrupt end to the storylines, hendered this process.  Again, I believe Hilda Gurley-Highgate is perhaps one of the most prolific writers to come out recently, and I have no doubt that as she continues with her craft she will soon become a writer who will be studied by generations of scholars.	2003-01-08

I was a little girl in Alabama but I can remember my parents keeping me close to them for fear that the murders might somehow reach farther than the border of our two states.  Tayari Jones expertly narrated these stories by the individuals affected by these incidents the most---the children.<br />Not many authors can master the voice and tone of a child successfully, but Ms. Jones did so with a level of extreme sophistication.  While reading this phenomenal book, I felt like I was right back in the 80's, sitting in front of the television and watching the nightly news, saddened beyond belief whenever they would announce that another of my young, distant commarades had been ruthlessly killed.  Black children in Atlanta were in the midst of a war during that crazy period in history, and the travesty is that it has taken this long for someone to tell this story from the perspective of the children with humanity and dignity.

Certain aspects of the story were predictable, but she was able to couch the predictable in such exciting, stimulating characters that the reader is pretty much able to overlook these minor flaws.  Perhaps my only major disappointment about the book was that the hairdresser, Pearl, too closely resembles the hairdresser in Terry McMillan's book, WAITING TO EXHALE.  But overall, the book is just the type of read you want if you just want to be entertained and get to see how the other half lives.<br />The character of Barbara is the quentissential grand dame.  Too much money and too little self-esteem.  Her whole life revolves around her husband Bradford, a man who has been told just a few times too many how fine he is.<br />Pearl, as I stated before, resembles the hairdresser in WAITING TO EXHALE a little too much.  In fact, too much, but like in EXHALE, she is one of few redeemable characters in the story, and you can't help but to root for her.<br />Jolene is the female equivalent of Bradford minus the fat bank account.  According to the story, she worked but the only working the reader got to see was her &quot;working over&quot; other womens' husbands.  It is clear where her low self-esteem and self-deprecating behavior came from, but it was difficult to read her chapters.  You just wanted to slap some sense in her and challenge her to get  a life.<br />Candice, Candice, Candice.  She definitely got the rug pulled out from under her, and the beauty of it was, even though I saw it coming, it was still beautiful to watch.  I won't ruin it for you, but the storyline is priceless.  Briscoe deals with a Pandora's box that a lot of folks like Candice should rummage through. The ending chapter with she and her family was a little weak, but everything up until that point was solidly written.<br />Lee needed more development, or just not be a part of the story.  Her storyline was so complex that it was more of a distraction for me than an added bonus, but that is just one reader's opinion.<br />Bottom line, this is a book that will keep the reader flipping the pages.

Interjecting just the right amount of sentimentality is often times too difficult of a task for even the most talented writers, but Connie May Fowler tackles both topics with a level of sensitivity and finesse that makes this book a \\"must read.\\"  BEFORE WOMEN HAD WINGS tells the story of Avocet \\"Bird\\" Jackson, a world-weary child in search of love among the people whose love should be a given but who are sometimes the most stingy with their affections.  Bird tells the story of many young women who have either witnessed or experienced abuse in a matter-of-fact, no-holds bar fashion.  The complexity of the relationship between she and her parents and she and her sister and brother provides readers with a wide-open look into a tragic life that eventually makes a transcendent jump into a path of redemption.

However, I could not help but to add my two cents in light of the fact that there seemed to be an overwhelmingly large faction of people who enjoyed GIRLFRIENDS. Maybe it is an age thing. I'm thirty-something and maybe, just maybe, this book was not written with me in mind. Maybe it is a patience thing. I had lost all of mine by the time I got to the chapter entitled \\"Cheep wine, Lucy, and sex,\\" and believe me, that wasn't too far into the book. But I think the main thing is that even though I believe this author has a genuinely funny sense of humor, (okay, I did say something positive) he perhaps took on more than he could handle in this book. I'm not saying a man can't write about women. There are plenty of good examples of male authors who have truly captured the true essence of womanhood and done it in a way that is humorous yet doesn't in any way demean or dismiss how multi-faceted and multi-dimensional women can be.<br />But in the case of GIRLFRIENDS, I felt over-inundated with cliches and stereotypes. The jokes seemed to be too predictable and I finished the book only because that is just me...I hate to NOT finish something that I start. I think Mr. Sanchez has the capability to develop his humor and his writing into something that will reach a wide range of audiences. (okay, another positive) I just hope that he will take the time and expend the energy to do so.	2001-09-23

There is not much that I can say about THE LIVING BLOOD that hasn't already been said. As is the case many times, I bought this book at my local bookstore while searching for another. I was not disappointed. I had never read anything by Ms. Due before and there was nothing on the jacket cover to clue me in that this was a sequal to another. Of course by the time I figured that out, I was too deep into this wonderful novel to put it down. But the talented Ms. Due was able to do what few writers are able to accomplish--she wrote a sequal that clearly satisfied the appetites of those who read the first book, MY SOUL TO KEEP, but she also formulated her storyline in such a way that a first time reader of this Epic story of Jessica Jacobs-Wolde and her husband David could follow and find an equal amount of satisfaction.<br />This book touches every emotion that a person could feel and then it turns around and touches a few that the person didn't know he or she even had. Many times science fiction seems in direct contradiction to reality as we know it, but at no time did this story ever veer so far to the left or right that it left the reader questioning its plausibility. Jessica's story of mother-love is one that any mother, mortal or in this case, immortal, could relate to. So too is the story of Lucas Shepard and his love for his son, and his desperate need to believe that there was a blood that could save his child. The history behind the blood might cause some readers a little momentary discomfort, but they will soon see that it is a necessary piece to the puzzle of this story. My only complaint is that I didn't want the story to end. I can't imagine that there is more to tell of this wonderful story of the immortals, but if Ms. Due decides to write it, I will be one of the first to buy it.	2001-09-21

A woman whose very name caused &quot;good&quot; women to frown and &quot;good&quot; men to smile. She is the walking epitome of sexuality, and has an aura that draws people to her, even in their rejection of her. Bernice L. McFadden in her first novel paints a riveting, haunting tale that intertwines the stories of Sugar and Pearl Taylor in a way that leaves the reader breathless. You can't help but to feel the pain and sorrow that propels these characters headlong into an unlikely friendship that soon flourishes into a sisterhood, a unified front against an oppressive community that can only see things in shades of black and white, never gray. The journey that these characters make towards an eventual transcendental height of salvation from everything temporal into a place that is filled with forgiveness and love is breathtaking. There is no way to read this story about the Bigelow women without revisiting some of our own haunted pasts.	2001-09-18

Too often one finds individuals who are capable of telling a story but not capable of breathing life into one. Nancy Peacock is truly a life giver with her novel HOME ACROSS THE ROAD. Her opening line, &quot;In 1973, China Redd was waiting to die&quot; gives the reader a first glimpse into the complex world of the Redd family. The reader soon learns that China Redd can't die until she tells this incredible story. A story of the white Redds and the black Redds. A story of white America and black America. A story that not only needed to be told, but demanded it. As is the case with much of African American history, it exists, primarily in the minds and hearts of the walking oracles who lived it first hand. Nancy Peacock gives the fictional oracle, China Redd, an arena to tell a story that is grounded in truth. The story flows smoothly from the past to the present, and it gives the reader a glimpse into the world that many black people lived but did not live to tell about.	2001-09-18

So much of our history is either robbed from us or never brought to light. NO CRYSTAL STAIR provides readers, through the saga of Ann Elizabeth Carter and Army Air Corps pilot Robert Metcalf, a brief glimpse into the world of the black privileged class as well as the determined, black working poor. Without apology or excuse, Ms. Rutland allows her readers to plunge themselves into over sixty years of love, passion, sadness, and laughter in the families represented in this book. Readers get to see that yes, there was high society in the African American race, and like with any &quot;moneyed&quot; group, they had their problems, but when the chips were down, they pulled together with the larger group for equality and justice for all. The story takes us through the World War where brave young black men stood proud and soared high among the clouds. It also lands us squarely into the age of consciousness where black folk redefined themselves through their movements and their leaders. But through it all, we see the unity that exists among a people that are both different and the same. After reading the final page, I could not help but to smile and reflect on the fact that yes, life has not been &quot;no crystal stair,&quot; but, like Langston says,&quot;We're still climbin.'&quot; Thank you for sharing this story, Ms. Rutland.	2001-09-18

Because so much of our history has been downplayed or dismissed, this book provides a breathtaking glimpse into a world that many African Americans never even knew existed.  THE WEDDING is the story of Shelby Cole, beloved daughter of the prominent Coles family.  But more than that, it is the story of black culture, that part that both embraced and rejected itself.  It is the story of love outside of the color-divide and it is the story of how no matter how hard we try and how hard we try to dismiss it---color is, and will always be an issue.  It's not a white issue or a black issue but a human issue.  Dorothy West presents it in a way that is upfront and honest.  She doesn't try to &quot;whitewash&quot; the history of color-struckness that continues to plague many in the African American community.  Through the story of the Coles family, she began to hack away, even if only a little, at the very core of what continues to divide and in some cases conquer the African American community's ability to move on from our shackled past.	2001-09-18

It would be easy to be nitpicky and point out those aspects of Ms. McLarin's work that were still a little rough around the edges, but I choose to focus on the positive and say that Ms. McLarin tackled a very timely issue and illustrated it both sympathetically and without apology. TAMING IT DOWN illustrates the emotionally quagmire that many African Americans face when circumstances afford them the opportunity to move up and move out of their black community. As is the case with Hope, they are many times left feeling torn and displaced. Hope's emotional meltdown along with her quest to find herself and determine where she fits in the overall scheme of things has a kernal of truth that has to strike a cord in the consciousness of many African Americans. All in all, this was a good first novel. I hope to see much more from Miss McLarin.	2001-09-18

This book marks a journey, and not just a journey for its main character, 14-year-old John Grimes.  It is also a journey for the author. Baldwin said before he could write anything else, he had to write GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN. The Odyssey that John Grimes embarks on towards manhood, towards his religious development, and yes, towards his own sexuality, is mirrored very succinctly within the life of Baldwin. Anyone who reads this as purely a religious conversion is missing the point. In my opinion, this novel is less about John's discovery of God, and more about his discovery of himself.	2001-09-18

There is not an African American alive who has not played around with the notion of &quot;how would I have handled being a slave.&quot; Ms. Butler has supplied one possible answer. She illustrates in ways that only she is capable of ilustrating that bottomline, when thrust into our darkest nightmare, the mode of operation for most of us would be the same...surviving at all cost.	2001-09-08

WHAT YOU OWE ME is definitely one of those books that causes me to have mixed feelings. On one level, I am floored by Ms. Campbell's continued efforts to challenge herself as an author by exploring new and innovative ways to stretch the limits of a genre that has at times become binding and restrictive. With this book, she has truly gone outside of the box that many African American writers have willing placed themselves in with their sister/friend, my man &quot;done&quot; left me, playa' hater books.<br />We enter into the world of WHAT YOU OWE ME by hearing the words of the deceased who clearly still have as much of a voice as they ever did when they were alive. Of course Hosanna's voice rings out loudest of all, but there are also the voices of Gilda Rosenstein's ancestors pushing and tormenting her as well. Yet, in spite of this very creative way of challenging the reader to acknowledge that we are moved by more than just our own drive and determination but also by the drive and determination of those who lived before us, I found a number of things problematic about this book. As many have stated, the sub-plots, although interesting, were too much. I found myself feeling robbed of the stories of people that I would have liked to have known more about. All of the secondary stories were important, timely stories that demanded attention, and I'm afraid they were unfortunately relegated to the back burner. There were issues of father/daughter relationships, teen drug abuse, race relations, the price of fame, and the list goes on and on. In and of themselves, these issues could constitute a book, but when the writer allows these secondary issues to become just enough of the books storyline to pique the readers interest he/she is almost obligated to bring the reader to a satisfying conclusion on these stories. That did not happen in this book.<br />As a result of all of these mini-plots, the main plot tended to get rushed through. A number of important scenes that needed to be fleshed out more, like the relationship between Gilda and Hosanna or even the childhood of Matriece and her sister, were, at best, given a hasty glossing over that left the reader only somewhat &quot;getting&quot; why various characters behaved and reacted to situations in certain ways. Yet, with all of that aside, Bebe Moore Campbell was still able to hold most of this story together in a book that will at the very least introduce readers and fledgling writer wannabes with an example that writers, particularly African American writers, are quite capable of writing outside of the box.eeded to be fleshed out more, like the relationship between Gilda and Hosanna or even the childhood of Matriece and her sister, were, at best, given a hasty glossing over that left the reader only somewhat &quot;getting&quot; why various characters behaved and reacted to situations in certain ways.

As the editor who worked with Wade on this book, I will admit that I have a certain level of bias associated with this book, but, in spite of that, I can honestly say that Wade has written a book that will inspire, encourage, and enlighten any parent, minister, teacher, etc. who has ever had to struggle with raising a young person in this world of ours that is filled with all sorts of vices to tempt our young people.  Almost every issue that our children are dealing with today is discussed in this book in a way that is accessible and helpful.  Once again, Wade Rowatt has written a book that will serve to help all of us who are struggling to deal with adolescents in crisis.	2001-06-19

I lucked upon this book while looking for another, and I have to say, I was not disappointed.  Ms. Bowen held no punches and gave readers a glimpse of the good,the bad and the holy in the Church, in a way that still left a good taste in the mouth of those struggling with the question of &quot;is it worth it if all of that is going on in the church.&quot;  All of the characters, especially Essie and Theophilus,felt like people I grew up knowing and going to church with and without a doubt, Walk Worthy Press and Ms. Bowen can hold their heads up high with CHURCH FOLK.  I will be waiting with much anticipation for the next book by Ms. Bowen.	2001-06-18

For the most part, she repackaged Mildred, Freda and the gang into a more contemporary storyline, and judging from most reviews, got away with it with very little complaint from her fans.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with revisiting old topics, and in some cases, revisiting old storylines (of course it would be nice if the writer would just say that rather than give the old characters new names), but for someone who writes at the level that Terry McMillan writes, I, for one, expected a whole lot more than a Danielle Steele/John Grisham type formulaic story in this much anticipated book.	2001-06-12
