As a proud citizen of America flips through the pages, however, he soon discovers Tocqueville's admiration at American democracy stems not from an intrinsic love for it, but from the amazement that something so dangerous has somehow avoided falling off of the cliff. In fact, Tocqueville spends most of his chapters listing his endless concerns about democracy.<br /><br />In all, to Tocqueville, democracy in general presents three intrinsic dangers for its citizens: it does not guarantee them a secure life, it does not guarantee them a prosperous life, and it does not guarantee them an enlightened life of freedom. Against these general tendencies, Tocqueville lists three essential factors which secure democracy in America-the lack of which would mean the end to American liberty. They are: America's geography, political system, and religion.<br /><br />Looking at America today, Tocqueville's three securing factors for American democracy are long gone, however, the loss of its guardian angels has not resulted in the materialization of the three dangers and America today is as democratic and free as it has ever being. Tocqueville has been proven wrong because he misunderstood and discounted democracy's ultimate force-the drive for equality. Tocqueville thought the search for equality would ultimately draw people away from freedom, but to the contrary, the demand of equality is the ultimate guarantee of freedom in democracy.<br /><br />The Three Dangers of Democracy<br /><br /> The foremost duty of any civil society is to provide security, and to Tocqueville, the democratic state can not guarantee this. The democratic people have been loosened from the old ties of society, and living independently, they no longer see the need to help another in danger until they themselves are attacked. When they do see danger, however, the whimsical nature of democratic deliberation and the lack of central control especially in the American confederation prevent a timely and sustained defense against the enemy. Tocqueville writes, \\"...I refuse to believe that, with equal force on either side, a confederated nation can long fight against a nation with centralized government power.\\" (p170) Indeed, if a great army could indeed be assembled, this necessarily entails greater centralization, which only brings more dangers to democracy.<br /><br /> Beyond security, the people will also desire prosperity, and prosperity requires the building of an economic infrastructure that only the society as a whole is capable of. The nation must make laws that encourage innovation, construct roads, regulate industries, fund schools, etc. Many of these activities require sustained efforts which, again, a short sighted and frequently changing government by the people can not commit to since \\"habitual inattention must be reckoned the great vice of the democratic spirit.\\" (p611) Additionally, even when the people do commit to an act, their officials who are not the \\"fittest man\\" (p199) can not accomplish much because they spend their whole time worried about reelection.<br /><br />Democracy promises to set each free through voting, but sadly, to Tocqueville, the lack of security and prosperity must engender Democracy's fall toward centralization which will create a benumbing voice of the majority that will silence opinions and suffocates freedom. The minority will surely suffer, but even the majority, believing that they are in charge of the government, will lose their sight on the exact operations of the government which they have relegated away and will lose freedom. Tocqueville writes,<br /><br /> \\"The Americans believe that in each state supreme power should emanate directly from the people, but once this power has been constituted, they can hardly conceive any limits to it. They freely recognized that it has the right to do everything.\\" (p669)<br /><br />The worry here is not that the government will exploit the people's inattention, but that the citizens will no longer be enlightened by their daily political \\"exercises\\" and that the activity of the entire nation will lose its vitality, turning the society into a stony machine of bureaucrats and the people into dusts on a chessboard.<br /><br />The Three Guarantee of American Democracy<br /><br /> Countering the three above impacts, Tocqueville thought that American Geography, politics and religion preserve freedom, prosperity, and security.<br /><br /> Stretching between two oceans and with only two weak neighbors, the geography of the United States gives America the leisure to have a confederated government. The Continent also offers open space for the young and the ambitious. Although the nation is weak in achieving collective projects, with boundless opportunities and population growth, the collective result of individual expansion is sufficient for prosperity. Indeed, as people move on, \\"it is the seed of life and of prosperity that he bears.\\" (p281)<br /><br />The governmental structure of the U.S. also allows it to prosper and helps to preserve freedom. The Union has enough power to fight against small enemies such as the Indians, yet it avoids centralization by empowering the locals.  Certainly, localized and centralized democracy both suffer from short-sightedness and suppression of the mind, however, local policies are easier to observe, and taking part in politics, the people are enlightened and freer. Tocqueville writes, \\"The New Englander is attached to this township because it is strong and independent...in the restricted sphere within his scope, he learns to rule society\\" (p70) As one learns to rule, he will also be empowered and emboldened to start prosperous private enterprises.<br /><br /> More than politics and geography, to Tocqueville, Religion has the greatest impact on freedom and also improves prosperity. Religion always marches along with the adventurers and secures in the Western frontiers not only the equality based American political system but also American commerce by helping to establish law and order in new territories. Tocqueville writes, \\"...the spirit of man rushes forward to explore it in every direction; but when that spirit reaches the limits of the world of politics, it stops of its own accord...\\" (p47) It stops because of the taming power of religion, and without this restraining stability, a people can not have security, prosperity, nor freedom.<br /><br />At the same time, by connecting people together through churches and providing them the warmth of family life, religion also moderates the Americans' excessive \\"habit of thinking of themselves in isolation and imagine that their whole destiny is in their own hands.\\" (p508) This habit would have induced men to delegate political concerns to central authority, and as they only see small things at hand, they would have lost the enlightenment which the independent political life provides.<br /><br />Today, the Three Guarantees No Longer Exist<br /><br /> Today, America is certainly no longer the America which Tocqueville saw, the three conditions that maintained the democratic institution are severely weakened.<br /><br /> Today, the deserts of the West have been converted into hundreds of miles of suburbia, and America spends billions of dollars guarding its southern border. People still dream, but unlike in the old days when anyone with any background can gain a piece of land through hard work, people today must compete against others for the limited pie. Additionally, America certainly still has no fear of the Canadian or Mexican army, but it has enemies throughout the world who are capable of attack.<br /><br /> Just as Tocqueville predicted, after each war, the central power in America became stronger. Today, local politics no longer excites the passion of the crowds, and states are more provincial. The national government controls a tremendous percentage of the national wealth, directs economic policies, sets regulation for every industry, and leads the greatest military in the world. Alarmingly, political apathy has also increased. Surely, the average American says he loves his democracy, but in the democracy he talks about the percentage of people who vote is far from 100% and even for those who do vote, the thousands of pages of Washington laws and decrees are out of their control.<br /><br /> The religious landscape has also changed. The morality of Christianity certainly still holds sway over many, however, the average American today certainly does not have the religious zeal of people 200 years ago. There are also large parts of the population that are atheists or believe in non-western religions. Strangely, some vocal Christians seem to promote an ever increasing share of religion in politics, or rather, politicians are becoming ever more agile at using religion for politics-two things which Tocqueville believed must be separated for either to be truly powerful.<br /><br />Without the Guarantees the People Are Still Free<br /><br /> Despite losing the old guarantee of security, America today still has security, prosperity and freedom.<br /><br /> Despite Sep. 11, America is certainly secure in the sense that the average American does not wake up worried that he will die simply because he lives in a democracy. Some groups might attempt small attacks, but no groups or dictatorial regimes can dream of winning a war against this super military power and internal security is also largely guaranteed by a large police force.<br /><br /> Despite the loss of the Wild West, local energy and uniform religion, America today certainly enjoys great prosperity. American companies dominate all lists of top companies in the world, and American innovations have improved the living conditions of mankind beyond imagination. There is certainly disparity between the richest and the poorest, however, the majority of the people enjoy prosperous middle-class life, and even the poorest are supported by a generous welfare system.<br /><br />  One might say that America has achieved the above security and prosperity exactly because power became centralized and the cost of these was the loss of freedom. This is a misconception. Indeed, political participation is limited to fewer people today and sometimes one wonders if the blind search for wealth should be tempered by some uniform religion again, but perhaps Americans have constructed an economic and political system that does not need much more innovation, and the works politicians today even if localized no longer heighten one's mind, but merely bore a person with their regularity.<br /><br />Today, the citizen's rights as consumers instead of voters define American freedom-when one goes into a store and chooses from a thousand different products, he knows that he is free. No longer must men be suppressed by the opinion of the majority, but each can freely buy the niche models personalized just for him. Shopping is the daily act of wallet voting-the modern equivalent of 19th century town hall meetings; the same restless agitation, excitement, and heightened sense of self-worth and joy pervade the modern marketplace. Of course, each person's mind is not only enlarged in her role as a consumer but also in his role as a marketer or producer who must dig out creative juices to satisfy customer demands.<br /><br />The effects of the vibrant consumer culture extend into the sanctified realm of intellectual endeavors. Institutional and individual consumers/investors/sponsors support in the U.S. the best researches in the world for practical and basic researches and vote with his wallet at who gets the tuitions or research grants. Perhaps the nation is a little too agitated, but if they wish, those who want to enjoy the serenity of life can certainly go to the country side or some forest and sustain a more peaceful existence.<br /><br />The Truth about Equality<br /><br /> From the above analysis, we could see that although Tocqueville argues convincingly for the three dangers of democracy and three cures of democracy, in fact, the dangers were not so dangerous and the cures were not the only cures. It might surprise Tocqueville that despite of the loss of the West, centralization and the weakening of religion, Americans today are as free, prosperous and secure as they have ever been.<br /><br />  The key of Tocqueville's miscalculation lies with his analysis of equality and freedom. Tocqueville believes that the democratic search for equality engenders jealousy which undermines freedom by dragging everyone down and letting some anonymous force rule over all. He writes,<br /><br />\\"There is indeed a manly and legitimate passion for equality which rouses in all men a desire to be strong and respected .This passion tends to elevate the little man to the rank of the great/ But the human heart also nourishes a debased taste for equality, which leads the weak to want to drag the strong down to their level and which induces men to prefer equality in servitude to inequality in freedom.\\" (p669)<br /><br />To him, the geography, political structure and religious mores in America were the restraining factors that limited the downward tendency of equality which induces people to simply follow without thinking. The loss of free thinking would not only prevent men from reaching a more enlightened and dignified state, but also ultimately undermine the security and prosperity of the nation through its benumbing effects on the nation's overall social, political and economic situations.<br /><br />In reality, equality is the greatest guarantee of freedom. America's worship of equality does not incite jealousy like Tocqueville asserts, instead, Americans happily admire at those who through their efforts build up great wealth, and imitate them as they march on in their own dreams. Democratic people are only jealous of others if they win without a more or less fair competition. It is true that nothing can ever be perfectly fair, but the American society is generally merit based. One only has to look at Governor Schwarzenegger to realize that anyone in this Country has got a chance. Even for people with connections, they still need to work hard to prove themselves-Bush Senior certainly helped Bush Junior, but Bush Junior still had to win the hearts of Americans to become the President.<br /><br />When a democratic man does not achieve as much worldly success as someone else, he is not troubled. Unlike the surf in an aristocratic age who feels intrinsically inferior to those with more honor than him, the average man in a democratic society might have achieved nothing great but yet feel perfectly certain that he has achieved for himself a happier life than all others. He is certainly right, after all, freedom and elevation of the mind does not rest on the material well-being of an individual, rather, it is the confidence that he has in his existence and the love he puts into his work that elevates him to the greatest glory of existence.<br /><br />It is precisely the general equality of opportunities and everyman's belief in himself that has allowed America to grow into the most powerful nation in the world with the greatest prosperity and security ever experienced by mankind. Tocqueville was certainly right in pointing out that the western territories, localized controls and a common religion helped America democracy; even today, America has less population density than many nations, the states are more powerful compared to the provinces in most other countries, and all Americans share the most basic principles of Christian morality evenif they are not Christians. Degrees of these three forces certainly contribute and contributed to making America a equal society, however, it is equality itself that is the soul of American liberty, prosperity and security, and the loss or weakening of its supporting factors do not change the soul itself.<br /><br />Time changes and Tocqueville's worries about democracy have luckily turned out to be false. Today, not only are the new Americans as free as ever, democracy is proving resilient in every kind of culture. On the one hand, the fact that Japanese, Indians, Russians, French, Chileans, Indonesians and Nigerians have all adopted democracy shows that Tocqueville's prediction that Democracy was unstoppable has proven true, and on the other side, his worry that democracy might need some channeling has also proven true considering that all these nations experienced decades of fake democracy before democracy was fully established. Tocqueville certainly deserves much credit for contributing to the spread of democracy with this masterpiece Democracy in America, but the small blemish is that, a little down in his perhaps prejudiced aristocratic mind, the great man thought Democracy to be less versatile than it has proven to be.<br /><br />In all, the ultimate wonder of democracy is that it allows each one of its members the equality to craft out a world for himself within which he quietly finds comfort.gion, America today certainly enjoys great prosperity.

US	51844093	R2HHGBWDY6K97G	0872201775	820409700	Leviathan: With selected variants from the Latin edition of 1668 (Hackett Classics)	Books	5	11	19	N	N	Essay; Absolute Sovereignty can not offer Perpetual Peace	Why Absolute Sovereignty Can Not Offer Perpetual Peace <br />-On the Desires of Men  <br /> <br />      In the Leviathan, Hobbes brings forward the theory that Commonwealths arise because without governments, people live in a state of nature with the constant danger of death. Furthermore, he believes that the best form of Commonwealth is one ruled by a monarch with absolute power; just like a person with two brains will not function, if the power of the monarch is not absolute, the commonwealth will fall back into the warring state of nature. When the sovereign power becomes truly absolute, Hobbes believes the Commonwealth could \\"live as long as mankind\\" unless attacked by foreign powers (p210). <br />   <br />      Indeed, Hobbes is right in that life under any government is better than life with no government, and also that multiple powers inside one commonwealth will cause an end to the commonwealth. Nevertheless, he is wrong in asserting that absolute monarchy is the panacea for perpetual internal peace. There are two intrinsic flaws in the his system which are bound to push the commonwealth into the state of nature: one flaw is the unchecked greed of the monarch, another is caused by the unfulfilled desire for power of the subjects. Although this paper can not offer a better formula for governments, it will show that absolute monarchy does not provide the perpetual security that Hobbes promises. <br /> <br />       First of all, extraordinary greed of the absolute ruler can break the Commonwealth. A ruler's greed can impoverish his subjects so abjectly that they no longer have enough food to survive on. Since the purpose of the commonwealth is to guarantee the security of life, and without food there is no life, the greed of the ruler will force the absolute Commonwealth to fall back into the state of nature.  <br /> <br />       Hobbes believes that the interest of the ruler and the interest of his subjects are so interdependent that the actions of the ruler will always be in the interest of his people. He writes, <br /> <br />      \\"Now in monarchy the private interest is the same with the public...the riches, power, and honor of a monarch arise only from the riches, strength and reputation of his subjects.\\" (P120)  <br /> <br />       Hobbes is right; the sovereign is the incorporation of its subjects, and so any injuries to the people are collectively an injury to the sovereign. Nevertheless, arising out of the great complications of the businesses of state and the wide expanse of a Commonwealth, there will always be a lag between when acts of the sovereign takes effect with people and when the sovereign feels the reactions of his people himself. A ruler with perfect prudence might be able to see through the gap and act in ways that are only ultimately good for the people and himself, but as Hobbes rightly observes, no one has perfect prudence (P14). This imperfect prudence becomes especially short-sighted when the ruler's reason is clouded by his present desires. Hobbes acknowledges these desires, for he says:    <br /> <br />     \\"And hence it is that kings, whose power is greatest, turn their endeavors to the assuring it at home by laws or abroad by wars; and when that is done, there succeeded a new desire, in some of fame from new conquest, in others of ease and sensual pleasures, in others of admiration or being flattered for excellence in some art or other ability of the mind.\\" (p58) <br /> <br />     So clouded by the lack of prudence and by excessive desires, the monarch might take actions that seem good at the moment for himself, but which turn out harmful for himself later. To illustrate this, let us observe the following scenario: <br /> <br />      The new ruler of a poor but secured country builds a modest palace, for he has learnt from history books that he should not splurge. A couple years later, however, a desire for great things tempts him, and he wants to build a winter palace. He seeks advices fromten advisors, who had all the qualities that Hobbes praises (Chapter XXV); nine out of ten advisors privately dissuade the king from this luxury for a flood is raging and their nation is poor. Saddened, the king turns to the last advisor, who, seeing an opportunity to gain favor with the ruler, loudly exclaims that the other counselors do not love their king who needs a winter palace to escape the cold. The king happily agrees with him as his reason becomes clouded by desires; and soon, the construction begins.  <br /> <br />        Having gained favor, the 10th advisor convinces the ruler to imprison the other advisors for their \\"bad mouthing\\" of the king, making him the sole voice by the ruler's ear. As time goes on, the king exerts ever greater taxes on his people to pay for ever grander palaces, and every time, the advisor not only finds more elaborate excuses for the king but praises him for his greatness and also funnels some of the money for construction into his own coffer. The affairs of the nation are in utter neglect.  <br /> <br />      One night, the king remembers his father's warnings against indulgence, and he shakes with fear; but when he sees his gardens filled with singing girls half naked, lacking the prudence to see the future awaiting him, he says to himself, \\"I have been endowed differently by God, the fate of others can not be my own.\\"   <br /> <br />      The poor people of this nation become more desperate by the day, yet the ruler who lives deep inside his palaces can not know their suffering. Some years later, the harvest is so bad that people have barely enough to feed themselves, yet the king sends his money collectors for even higher tax quotas. Realizing that they could either die of starvation or die fighting against the dictator with at least a chance to live, the farmers revolt. Hobbes would support them, for he writes, \\"the obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect hem.\\" (P144) <br /> <br />      When the farmers' army charges into his bed chamber, the king finally feels the injuries that he has done to the people and to himself, yet reason and prudence are too late. <br />  <br />       Absolute sovereignty means absolute power, and as the old saying goes, \\"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" In fact, Hobbes acknowledges the greedy corruption of the monarchs, and even gives his justification. He writes, <br /> <br />         \\"A man may here object that the condition of subjects is very miserable, as being obnoxious to the lusts and other irregular passions of him or them that have so unlimited a power in their hands...not considering that the estate of man can never be without some incommodity or other, and that the greatest that in any form of government can possibly happen to the people in general is scarce sensible, in respect of the miseries and horrible calamities that accompany a civil war.\\" (P117) <br /> <br />         Hobbes makes no mistakes here. Any government is better than no government, but as mentioned before, he makes the claim later that Commonwealths, \\"by the nature of their constitution they are designed to live as long as mankind\\" unless attacked by foreign powers (210). In the same chapter (XXIX), Hobbes attributes all the internal infirmities of the Commonwealth that shorten its \\"natural\\" life to variations of the lack of absolute power, but describes no infirmities when the Commonwealth is ruled by an absolute monarch. He thus makes it clear that if there is absolute power, then the commonwealth will \\"live as long as mankind\\" even if the monarch is corrupted. However, as shown in the illustration above, Hobbes' absolute monarchy does have tremendous infirmities.  <br /> <br />       Hobbes can, however, still argue that the previous illustration is an extreme example that barely happens in reality. Hobbes might say that if only the absolute sovereigns all studied the Leviathan carefully, they will always initiate policies for the interest of the people. Granted, Hobbes' excellent book can convert many, yet, even when the absolute sovereign is good and strong, the Commonwealth can still fall back into the state of chaos. <br /> <br />       To Hobbes, the foremost law of nature is to find security (\\"a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive to his life\\" [P79]), but is survival the only thing that men search for? No. As Hobbes points out himself, survival is the means and not the ends of life. And while people all want to survive, they live for different ends of life as influenced by their education and upbringings. Hobbs indirectly talks about the fulfillment of some ends life when he writes, <br /> <br />       \\"In such condition (of war) there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently, no culture of the earth, no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building\\" (p76) <br /> <br />        For certain people, the end of their life lies in gaining political power-to be the ruler instead of the ruled. Hobbes indirectly recognizes people's \\"unnecessary\\" desire for power, when he writes (OL) \\"there are those who, from pride and a desire for glory, would conquer the whole world, which they pursue farther than their security requires.\\" (P75) <br /> <br />        This kind of desire, nevertheless, can not be fully satisfied in a state of absolute sovereignty. For one, the greatest prize of all, the prize of becoming your own sovereign is off-limits. Additionally, although those borne with the heart of Napoleon might be few, lower offices and positions in a state of absolute power come merely at the mercy of the sovereign-for one eager for any honor and position, his dream may never fly high because the sovereign can give the honor he deserves to someone else. As Hobbes says himself, \\"a man may be worthy of riches, office, and employment, that nevertheless can plead no right to have it before another, and therefore cannot be said to merit or deserve it.\\" (p57) <br /> <br />       For some, the limitation on of the fulfillment of their political dreams results in nothing other than the acceptance of their fates, yet history never fails to produce some who have the eagerness and bravery to challenge the ultimate authority and break the bondage of power.  <br /> <br />       Hobbes would call the act of such eager men anti-nature, since dissenters will almost certainly face unnatural deaths by the sword of the king, or face the danger of death by returning to the state of nature. However, again, survival is the means, not ends of life. The following example illustrates why people might endanger their means for their ends. <br /> <br />        Colonized people have throughout history fought for independence against their colonial sovereigns. To Hobbes, these wars for independence must be irrational: for one, the colonized people could be enjoying many benefits either from direct aid or commercial links with their colonizer; additionally, hundreds of thousands of colonized people might die in the immediate war or during the consequent internal power struggles caused by the revolt. Yet, despite the \\"practical benefits\\" and the peace that the colonial sovereigns bestows upon the colonized, this smooth highway of subjugation is not the one that the people want; they desire for a road, smaller and rougher maybe, but one that is built by themselves to a destination that they determined for themselves. Thus, in their search for the power that is forbidden to them, they set out for the \\"unreasonable\\".  <br /> <br />       To be sure, Hobbes' Law of Nature still holds: on the battle fields, those who fight against the sovereign will always do all they could to triumph over their enemy and avoid death, but again, the need for survival is only a part of the story.  <br /> <br />      Regarding this fightfor independence, Hobbes might say, as he writes, \\"those men that are so remissly governed that they dare take up arms to defend or introduce an opinion are still in war.\\" (P113) This means that since the any revolutionaries must never have been a part of the commonwealth, and hence the commonwealth was only attacked from the outside and did not fall internally. Nevertheless, Hobbes also says that a monarch's \\"subjects\\" are delivered from their former obligation, and become obliged\\" to the victor in a war against their original sovereign. (P145) The new subjects of the monarch might have a high tendency toward revolting against ruler for the same reasons mentioned before, and in this case, Hobbes must certainly recognize that the revolutionaries are a part of the Commonwealth.  <br /> <br />     In the Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes dedicates himself to finding the best form of government, that perfect house which can last forever and provide eternal peace for all. The book is quiet admirable with its precise arguments and high ideals. Nevertheless, Hobbes ignores the fact that people will always willingly take actions that might hurt their security because they are either short-sighted or desire for something other than mere survival. Still, the Leviathan is a work of Epic proportion, and this essay does not find a form of government better than absolute sovereignty.	2005-06-07

That blonde beast which seems ready to bite into any flesh without the pangs of conscious inevitably conjures up images of a ferocious maniac who would wreck the world, bringing with it infinite sufferings to the grocery-store-citizens and the corn-field-peasants. In fact, this weak peasant who plows his land and prays before his god and whom Nietzsche despises seems like a much more amiable character to the general reader. Certainly, this peasant will not have the will-to-power to reshape the world, but he will be more or less the relative peace of normal life.   <br /> <br /> Nietzsche, however, can not be so easily dismissed, and if one believes in the above description of the strong against the weak, he is missing the essence of Genealogy. In fact, Nietzsche's blonde beasts are not renegades against the world, instead, they are the masters of the world who recognize the inherent conditions of their environment; this grasp of reality gives them command over promise and forgetfulness, and allow them to set the directions of the world with whatever values they see fit. They are indeed strong, but they are not lawless monsters to be feared. The true renegades against this world are the people who follow the slave morality-they can not succeed in the world because they refuse to conform to the conditions of reality. Under the general rubric of empowerment established by Nietzsche, Weber follows in Politics as Vocation with a concrete example of self-empower in the role of the politician, and Plato also uses Nietzsche's methods in his search to understand the nature of man and society.  <br /> <br /> The Genealogy of morals is in fact a genealogy of human weakness and suffering. This suffering arises because the conditions of civil life require activities that are in contradiction to the traditional life of the independent savages. This suffering consequently results in \\"bad consciousness\\", from which arises a belief within the weakling that he is inherently sinful and bad.  Nietzsche writes, <br /> <br /> \\"I regard the bad conscience as the serious illness that man was bound to contract under the stress which occurred when he found himself finally enclosed within the walls of society and of peace.\\" (N, p84) <br /> <br />Nietzsche does not offer an outcast view on this point, and it is easy to imagine the decrease in freedom and increase in pain that men experienced when they turned from hunter and gathers to agriculturalists. When Ghengis Khan marched his horsemen into the lands of the Han or the Muscovites, the Mongolians horsemen despised the conquered natives for their pathetic existence as farmers who had to work all year long doing monotonous work but only to be disappointed by draught or flood.  <br /> <br /> The agricultural life is only one aspect of the constraint of life of civil man. Living in the state, the man is often deprived of land and is confronted by civil forces thousands of times greater. To lessen his pain, the provincial agriculturalist turns toward the hopes of religion and such, giving rise to the slave Morality which Nietzsche passionately accuses.  Nietzsche writes,  <br /> <br /> \\"We stand before a discord that wants to be discordant, that enjoys itself in this suffering and even grows more self-confident and triumphant the more its own presupposition, its physiological capacity for life, decreases.\\" (p118) <br /> <br />The situation which propelled the suffering people to turn toward \\"bad consciousness\\" is precisely the situation of the man with toothache. One should find a dentist and fill cavities when he has toothache; but those who are too lazy to find a doctor, or refuse to eat less candies will continue to suffer until it is too late and their teeth have already rotten away. But during and at the end of this process, in order to justify one's existence despite his sickness, thesick man tells others that the pain in his mouth is actually a great joy to have and teeth are bad anyway. Despite this effort to manipulate psychology, the man can not escape facts of his body, which is that without teeth he can not chew.  <br /> <br />The agriculturalists were forced into a new situation in which they suffered, and the solution was to turn to the morality of the weak. The morality of the weak, in fact, has become so prevalent that many feel it is the only way to live life despite the self-negation and hate inherent in it. As he points out this problem, Nietzsche does not offer a solution explicitly; rather than prescribing, Nietzsche describes an alternative way of life of the truthful and the noble-an alternative way to resolve the problems of civil life. These men do not suffer the pains of the weak, and the reader, desiring for relief from his corrupted existence, must feel a natural inclination toward the \\"nobler\\" way of life.  <br /> <br />Just before the weak gets ready to embark on a new life, however, they might be shocked back by Nietzsche vigorous depiction of the strong which makes them intimidating and unruly. But in fact, despite their strong \\"physicality\\", the strong are not anti-social monsters, but people who are the most willing to conform to the conditions of civil life. To understand their nature, we must delve into their qualities of strength, memory and forgetfulness. Nietzsche writes,  <br /> <br /> \\"The knightly-aristocratic value judgments presupposed a powerful physically, a flourishing, abundant, even overflowing health, together with that which serves to preserve it: war, adventure, hunting, dancing, war games, and in general all that involves vigorous, free, joyful activity.\\" (p33) <br /> <br />This passage must not be taken to mean that one must be a Napoleon to be strong, or one who has the right blood pressure and cholesterol level will be strong, or that those who are naturally smaller have no chances in salvation.Real physical health could indeed be beneficial, but the physicality here implies a physicality of the mind-It is the experiences from war and adventure which strengthen one's understanding of the world and of himself that Nietzsche cares about, not the acts of war or adventure themselves. The man of physicality is a man who knows his environment and who can take advantages of its situation to fulfill his ends,  <br /> <br /> Nietzsche elucidates the specific quality of the strong when he describes their ability to forget and to remember. On forgetting, Nietzsche writes, forgetting offers  <br />\\"a little quietness, a little tabula rasa of the consciousness, to make room for new things, above all for the nobler functions and functionaries...\\" (p58) <br /> <br />This forgetfulness at the core is an understanding over the situations of the world, it is about forgetting the senseless worries which only make man impotent. The weakling, after a disaster, will simply dwell upon the horrors of the disaster without understanding the natural causes. He will sink into a world of doubts and superstition, and as Nietzsche writes, he will think that he has done things intrinsically evil against his gods or ancestors. The strong person, on the other hand, has gained a knowledge of the world, and knows that there is no gods behind the clouds. Hence, they might worry, but they will not feel bitter or gain a \\"bad conscious\\" against themselves because of the rain. Eradicating worries-this is the essence of forgetfulness. Worry is passion-consuming, and only when the man is independent from can he have the mental capacity left over to gain a greater understanding of the world-he has more time to experience the reality of this world through adventure, through wars. <br /> <br />The ability to make promises arises naturally from the lack of worry; the scientists who knows how clouds form can \\"promise\\" their coming. This promise could be for any ends which the active desire of the strong man wills. As Nietzsche writes, memory of the strong is \\"an active desire not to rid oneself, a desire for the continuance of something desired once, a real memory of the will.\\" (p58)  <br /> <br />Nietzsche also describes the memory of the slave morality and its relation to punishment, but this is a different memory than the strong man's memory. Nietzsche writes that the ascetic people's memory is \\"unforgettable, `fixed,' with the aim of hypnotizing the entire nervous and intellectual system with these `fixed ideas'\\" (p61) The strong memory is proactive, for it is \\"an active desire\\", the weak memory is reactive, for it is about \\"hypnotizing\\" the mind. One is used to help the will all its directions, while the wills in only one direction-the abyss into suffering.  <br /> <br /> This individual who possesses the control over past and future, memory and promises, is the \\"emancipated individual\\". This person is liberated \\"from morality of customs\\". This emancipation is not accomplished through killing the innocents or running naked, but through the ability to set \\"measure of value\\" (p60) based on reality. Nietzsche writes, \\"...this mastery over himself also necessarily gives him mastery over circumstances, over nature, and over all more short-willed and unreliable creatures.\\" Nietzsche is calling people to become \\"masters\\" over circumstances, not to destroy circumstances. The swordsman who is a master over his sword does not use his hands to fight, but is a master precisely because he uses the sword and knows where to find the best sword and how to use it the best.  <br /> <br />The difficulty of this mastery is precisely the difficulties of acquiring new languages: it is hard for an adult thrown into a different country to learn the native tongue, but unlike those of the slave morality who give up and blame oneself for inherent inability or blame the language for being evil, the strong people will patiently learn the language. All this requires is a little bravery!Nietzsche writes, man's suffering is  <br /> <br />\\"the result of a forcible sundering from his animal past, as it were a leap and plunge into new surroundings and conditions of existence, a declaration of war against the old instincts upon which his strength, joy and terribleness had rested hitherto.\\" (P85)  <br /> <br />Indeed, instinct is the ability of man to react quickly to familiar environment, but the civil man's life requires a new set of skills and understandings, new instincts. Just like the strong with their new tongue can now express themselves in anyway way they desire, the strong man in the greater world will be a master of the \\"language\\" of the civil society and thus gain the ability to set values and fulfill wills. <br /> <br /> The above ideas draw a positive conclusion from the genealogy, and offers hope to those who are brave, but the Genealogy is a pessimistic book. Nietzsche writes, <br /> <br /> \\"Man has all too long had an `evil eye' for his natural inclinations, so that they have finally become inseparable from his `bad conscience.' An attempt at the reverse would in itself be possible-but who is strong enough for it?... The attainment of this goal would require a different kind of spirit from that likely to appear in this present age...\\" (p96) <br /> <br />Reading this, it seems that our age is doomed, and the essay in front of you has been promoting a pointless hope that even the hope's supposed originator does not have. But Nietzsche's words are no mere pessimism, they carry a pessimism that is angry at the \\"bad air\\" in life, it is pessimism with passion! Nietzsche is an angry mother telling her son that he has no future at all because he only drinks himself to death in a bar every night. The world perhaps has been dark, but this anger will be the lightening rod which shakes away the shells of our complacent irreverence toward truth and nature!  <br /> <br /> When a reader is confounded by the world which Nietzsche depicts, he may turn toPolitics as Vocation by Weber. In this essay, Weber paints a specific case of the grandiose problem of adaptation, or survival in new environments, in the person of the conflicted politician.  <br /> <br /> Politics as Vocation inherits the essence of Genealogy of Morals in calling for the politician's mastery over circumstances. The politician must both be a master of his internal conditions, and his external conditions. Internally, for the politician to be a politician, he must have \\"passionate devotion to a `cause'\\". This passion, or excessive energy, however, can lead to vanity and then the \\"striving for power ceases to be objective and becomes purely personal self-intoxication\\" (p116). In order to counterbalance this tendency, Weber says that the politician must have a \\"cool sense of proportion\\" (p115). One's ardent political passion is the fire that will draw the hearts of a thousands followers, however, if he gets carried away by the worshipping crowds, then the fire has burnt onto himself. In another word, there is no strength in the ecstasy of self-adulation, there is no power when one does not even notice the reality within himself and is merely fooled by vanity. Although the context is different, Weber is asking exactly what Nietzsche asked: the politician must know what words of praises he should forget and always know what he needs to remember to keep his crowds in control; he needs to constantly adapt to the changing conditions of the crowd so that he will always know its language and express his Will with this tongue.  <br /> <br />Extending this into a greater sphere, politicians must rely on the support of businessmen and interest groups, and he necessarily have to use his power to bring to his backers a profit on their investments. Living in this reality, Weber advises the politician to gain mastery over the situation, to know the goals of their political life with a clarity, and to pursue this goal with a sense of responsibility to the goal. In Nietzsche's terms, the politician must learn to forget and not fall into the moral trap of self-deprecation against every \\"unethical\\" act that he necessarily takes, but he must also always remember his promised end which he will reach with his mastery over the tools of politics.  <br /> <br />  Behinds Webber, Plato also has similar things to say as Nietzsche. Nietzsche offers his readers hope with the model of the truthful he erects which all who have a little bravery could follow. Despite differences that can not be discussed here, Plato's creation of the noble city with the noble people could be regarded as an imaginary application of Nietzche's theory (although 2000 earlier).  <br /> <br />The whole of Republic is about understanding man and the world. Plato writes, \\"this very thing, good judgment, is clearly some kind of knowledge, for it's through knowledge, not ignorance, that people judge well.\\" (IV, 426e) The ultimate search for knowledge rests in understanding the light from the \\"sun\\", but practically speaking, Plato has made it his duty to search for human nature and the social nature of the Greek-state. The \\"tripartite soul\\" conclusion that he draws from the natural conditions of his world is contentious today, and Nietzsche certainly has much to say against it, however, the resolute search for understanding the internal and external conditions of man, however, is the same. <br /> <br />Furthermore, in building his world, Plato asks his nobles to be able to forget certain things with the noble lie. The goal here is precisely the same as Nietzsche's: Plato wanted to leave the inessentials in the past, and prevent obsession with the \\"dark\\" things that gods supposed did or the petty accounts of who was truly \\"silver\\" or \\"gold\\", stories and accounts that will elude man on their journey for greater power. With their passion freed from the foolishness of the past, from the plays of dark shadows reflected from the fires in the cage, men and society as a whole isbetter positioned to get out of the hole of the past and embrace the glory of truth. <br /> <br />In all, Nietzsche's strong men are not scary. The weak ones of the slave morality are not scary either, it is merely so sad to behold them that catapulted Nietzsche writes about them with such vehement anger. Nietzsche never says that the strong should be followed, and perhaps in other books of his one can draw differing conclusions about what Nietzsche really is promoting, however, from the Genealogy, it is clear that the contrast between the strong and the weak makes the strong a more appropriate role model. Again, one does not need to be scared of them, they are merely adroit adaptationists, masters of their environment, not destroyers.	2005-06-06
US	51844093	RSV81JS6U8IXQ	0140432078	297670499	On Liberty	Books	5	8	13	N	N	Essay: Alienation from Humanity, on Marx and Mill	The modern age is a dangerous age, an age in which we might be alienated from that individual independence in work and in mind which defines our humanity. Confronted by this crisis, Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill offer the world diverging solutions: annihilate the existing world and march toward communism, or guard against the dangers of the existing world as we further embrace liberal democracy. Despite these divergent paths which arise from differing views on the driving force of history, both systems aim to rescue the supreme interest of our individual humanity-for Marx, this interest lies in reaching absolute prosperity for the material man, and for Mill, it lies in the search for absolute truth for the idealistic man.<br /><br /> With its emphasis on individuality and diversity, Mill's theory is in a sense more  encompassing than Marx's. Mill's theory, however, is fundamentally flawed in comparison to Marx's because of its ignorance of property as a danger against human liberty.<br /><br /> Marx sees in the industrial age the death of the property-less class. This death is brought by the industrial age's five qualities: division of labor, accumulation of capital, competition, financial crisis, and monopoly. In this age, machineries and the division of labor reduce the skillful artisans to the proletariats who merely work on one monotonous element of production. The capitalists who own the machines enlarge their capital by exploiting the proletariat's labor, leaving them only with enough to eat. Competition forces capitalists to lower prices, but this is good only until each factory produces more than demanded and a financial crisis emerges. The small capitalists are reduced to the property-less as millions of workers are swept into deeper hell. Only the biggest capitalist survives, and he becomes the monopolist who can lower wages and raise prices at whim, destroying the lives of all. (Part 1, Bourgeois and Proletarians, Manifesto of the Communist Party)<br /><br /> The above scenario is unavoidable because the accumulation of more capital is the only end of capital. If the capitalist stops investing capital for gains he ceases to be a capitalist, and becomes a mere consumer of goods, enjoying the fruits of old exploitations. Tragically, capital can only increase when it exploits the difference of what labor costs and labor produces, as Marx writes,<br /><br />\\"The modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.\\" (Marx p484)<br /><br />The rich man sitting in his patio who has inherited a million pound and who lets others manage his money has not done anything to deserve profits, indeed, since he himself did not work, his profits must come from the works of others who he exploits. In the capitalistic system, there exists no pity, only keen self-interest, \\"all are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use...\\" (Marx p479)<br /><br /> The workers might die, but before their body ceases to be exploited, their mind is already died-capitalism has alienated them from their humanity which is defined by their creative productivity. This alienation from our humanity was Marx's greatest worry. Animals make nests and produce goods just as we do, however, as Marx writes,<br /><br />\\"...a bee would put many a human architect to shame by the construction of its honeycomb cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before he constructs it in wax... Man not only effects a change of form in the materials of nature; he also realizes his own purpose in those materials.\\" (Chapter 7, Das Kapital)<br /><br />In order to freely produce as the creativity of his mind directs him and as his productive ability allows, the material man must be endowed with control over the means of production. In the world of private property, however, the workers have turned from the master of production to the slave of the machine-they are reduced to programmed animals that produce merely for the end of survival.<br /><br /> The proletariat can only reassert his humanity by violent overthrowing the capitalists and through the \\"abolition of private property\\" (Marx p484). Once in communism, the workers will own the means of production and enjoy the full produces of their labor. He will be motivated to constantly transform the world into a more prosperous kingdom. As Marx writes, \\"In communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.\\" (Marx p485) The abundance of material goods will allow man to work not for survival, but for his own enjoyment. In this society, there will be no family and nor religion, everything is made for the love of all and enjoyed by all. Any vestiges of private interest would result in the return to capitalism with all its evils.<br /><br /> To Mill, the modern life is also threatening because the voice of the majority might alienate men from their individuality. The differentiation of society is essential for the vitality of the society, and this vitality empowers men on their search for truth.<br /><br />Political debates, according to Mill, have been about striking the balance between the ruler and ruled. It is necessary for the ruled to have a ruler in order to preserve peace and law, yet the elected or unelected ruler's power must be restrained so that he does not abuse it against the ruled. In contrast to Marx's class struggle, this \\"struggle between liberty and authority\\" (p59) from Mill is more amiable. In the current era of democratic nations, however, since the ruled are also the rulers, the opposition no longer exists. People feel that all actions taken by the people's government will be good for the people, and hence they lose the old vigilance against the invasion of public power into their private spheres. The voice of the majority becomes the equivalent of the truth and justice.<br /><br /> Mill is worried that this majority voice will obstruct man's search for truth, the attaining of which is the goal of life. Truth is not reached once and then preserved for eternity, it is an organic being with a thousand facets whose survival requires continued inputs of each person's active mind. This truth is the individual treasure of each being, fitting perfectly to his taste and preferences; yet it is also a truth for the whole community, since it is only through the struggles of different truths that humanity as a whole reaches a higher truth-a higher level for the activation of the mind. As Mill writes, \\"There is always need of persons not only to discover new truths and point out when what were once truths are true no longer\\" (p71) If the majority religion is the only religion and taste the only taste, then people will no longer think but simply follow; society will be bogged into the swamp of mediocrity with a mind that is dead. Marx also feared the death of the mind, the mind of the creative worker. Despite the differences, both philosophers are concerned about the destruction of man's defining qualities.<br /><br />To counter this, Mill proclaims that the only defense for \\"interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" (p68). The government must be restrained in the sphere of public affairs, and individuals shall live as free as they want to following their individual passions.<br /><br /> Marx and Mill both want to regain humanity. In one case, the enemy is the benumbing effects of majority rule, and man's mind for truth is debased forever into mediocrity, in the other case, the enemy comes from the benumbing effects of subjugation to the machine, and the man is turned from the master of production into the slaves of capital.<br /><br />  The core difference between the two theories in practical operation arises from their different views on individuality (both systems serve individuals as their ends, however, individuality, allowing people to be different, are treated differently). For Mill, we must preserve individuality to bring truth (Chapter 3, On Liberty), but for Marx, the destruction of private property is the only task. The communistic society will be a union in which man can \\"...hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner...\\" (The German Ideology). This free life of a communist in communism is all good until one day the comrade does not want to be a communist anymore-but he must be one, there is no choice. In Communism, one does not have the individual liberty to have families, nor try to build a little store of private wealth.<br /><br />On the other side, if someone in Mill's world decides to be a communist, he has the full right to do so. He can even segregate himself away with his friends and enjoy the life of a commune. In another word, Marxism can not destroy Mill's democracy-it will just be one of the many ways of thinking allowed by the system-but Mill's cry for diversity will destroy Marx's world within a second.<br /><br />Confronted with the above, Marx would reply like he did in the Jewish Question, that the so-called liberty and freedom of the capitalistic world are nothing other than man's desire to keep himself a self-sufficient nomad. As he writes, all the rights of man are simply \\"the right to enjoy one's fortune and to dispose of it as one will; without regard for other men and independently of society.\\" (Marx, p42)  Marx will say that only seeing the superficial political liberation is not to see the deeper human liberation which could only be achieved with the abolition of private property. Marx might not be completely right, but he does stand at a higher ground than Mill in this analysis of property.<br /><br />Mill in On Liberty is focused solely on avoiding the abuse of power through government, but he ignores the abuses that property owners are capable of against the property-less. In an agricultural society where everyone is equal and land unlimited, the government might be the only thing capable of suppressing individual liberty, but when one sees child-labor and 12 hour work day in modern industrial society, there is no doubt that capital could be a pitiless monster. Even when one ignores the industrial age, and tries to give Mill credit for drawing the best possible life for the pre-industrial man, one still can not avoid noticing the subjugation of the slaves, the suffering of the serfs, and all the other dark stories of the property-less in all the ages previous to the industrial one which Marx gives a full account of.<br /><br /> Marx and Mill were faced with the same modern phenomenal, the danger of been alienated from the defining quality of humanity in the face of a new economic and a new political system. Marx might not have made the best analysis, but he did have a deep understanding of history and the problems in history. He stood at the level of the common people and tried to solve their problems caused by their material desperation. Mill did not stoop to the common people, he looked up into the sky of truth and tried to preserve the march toward truth first embarked on by Plato.	2005-06-06

US	51844093	R197V7J76ILK6U	0521424453	520501859	Rousseau: 'The Discourses' and Other Early Political Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought) (v. 1)	Books	5	9	35	N	N	Essay, The Chain of Free Will	B1 refers to the 'the Discourses', B2 refers to the \\"Social Contract\\" by Rousseau<br /><br /> \\"Man are born free, but everywhere they are in chains.\\"<br /><br /> What a glorious line! Who would not want to shake off the chains and be free? The question is, what kinds of freedom is Rousseau talking about, and where is the source of the evil chain?<br /><br />Rousseau talks about two kinds of freedom, the freedom to act and the freedom to enjoy the fruits of action, both of which serve the goal of the preservation of life. The freedom to act is called \\"free will\\"; it differentiates men from animals and is directed by one's desires.<br /><br />In the state of nature, the \\"free will\\" of men allows them to find creative sources of subsistence as the environment changes, and each is free to enjoy the fruits of their labor because he has labored independently. In civil society, however, men must labor together and share their produces. Under these new conditions, \\"free will\\" will lead men to excessive desire which result in the usurpation of the others' freedom to enjoy the fruits of their labor. The loss of the freedom to enjoy puts the life of every member of the society under danger, and hence, in the civil society, \\"free will\\" has contributed negatively to its goal of the preservation of life.<br /><br />The chain of life, therefore, is in fact \\"free will\\", which was beneficial for the preservation of life in the state of nature, but detrimental to this goal in the civil society. Hence, for the civil society to achieve its end of preserving life, each individual must give up their \\"free will\\" and succumb their freedom to act to the general will of the society.<br /><br />Survival-the Goal of Life<br /><br /> Rousseau frequently repeats that preservation of life is the most fundamental goal of man's actions. He writes,<br /><br /> \\"Man's first sentiment was that of his existence, his first care is that for his preservation.\\" (B1, p161)<br /><br /> And,<br /><br />\\"His (man's) first law is to attend to his own preservation, his first cares are those he owes himself...\\" (B2, p42)<br /><br />As the first \\"care\\" and \\"law\\" of life, and the \\"first sentiment\\", the desire for survival is the singular progenitor to all other desires in life, and in the state of nature, will always trump all other interests in life. One might say that there are higher goals in life beyond mere survival. Indeed there are, however, if one does not survive, those higher goals of life could not exist either.<br /><br />  The mechanism by which men strive for survival is to act according their \\"free will\\". Rousseau writes,<br /><br />\\"I see in animal nothing but an ingenious machine to which nature has given senses in order to wind itself up and, to a point, protect itself against everything that tends to destroy or to disturb it. I perceive precisely the same thing in the human machine, with this difference that Nature alone does everything in the operations of the Beast, whereas man contributes to his operations in his capacity as a free agent...\\" (B1, p140)<br /><br />Here, Rousseau again emphasizes that the \\"ingenious machine\\" of animals and men share the goal of protecting their beings, however, the means to achieve this goal is different in that man are equipped with a different mechanism, their free will, to achieve this end. This different mean will turn out to be men's advantage of animals in survival.<br /><br />Free Will-the Advantage<br /><br />On the same page as the previous quote, Rousseau goes on to point out the disadvantage the Beast, which does not have free will. He writes,<br /><br />\\"...as a result the Beast cannot deviate from the Rule prescribed to it even when it would be to its advantage to do so...Thus a Pigeon would starve to death next to a Bowl filled with the choicest meats, and a Cat atop heaps of fruit or of gain, although each could very well have found nourishment in the food it disdains if it had occurred to it to try some...\\"(B1, p140)<br /><br />The Pigeon could not adapt to new environments as conditions changed since it has been programmed to act in only one way. This restricts Pigeons to places where they can find certain kinds of food. If their population grows to the extend that their restricted locales can no longer supply all the Pigeons with sufficient food, many pigeons will die away; if a natural disaster destroys all their habitats, then all pigeons will have to face death.<br /><br />On the other side, since men have \\"free will\\", they are not limited by their current conditions. Unlike the pigeon, the savage man could eat whatever he comes across and learn what food is beneficial or poisonous through experience. Rousseau writes,<br /><br />\\"Men...raise themselves to the level of the Beasts' instinct, with this advantage that each species has but its own instinct, while man perhaps having none that belongs to him, appropriates them all, feeds indifferently on most of the various foods which the other animals divide among themselves, and as a result finds his subsistence more easily than can any one of them.\\" (B1, p1350)<br /><br />The freedom must not only be limited to what kinds of food savages could eat but also their flexibility regarding lodging, sleeping and everything else that contribute to their survival. This flexibility allows men to survive anywhere and during any environmental changes; it consequently allows men to spread their seeds to the whole world. This is how \\"free will\\" contributes to the preservation of lives, and one must not misunderstand preservation as static-preservation is both directed toward those who are living and those who are young and those who have not been borne. Human's unique ability to preserve itself insures that it can grow and multiple.<br /><br />Free Will and Desires<br /><br /> Free will allows men to out-survive other animals, but free will itself is not an action but a process; it is the specific acts that a man wills that allow him to adapt. To will one action instead of another is to prefer one solution above another, and to have preference is to have desires for one thing more than another. For the purpose of the preservation of life, in the state of nature, a man must desire for what is to his survival. Hence, the goal of desires is to direct one's actions to what is beneficial for his survival. (Animals also have desires, however, the difference is: while both a man and a cat desire to eat, only the man can desire about how to eat.) Rousseau writes,<br /><br /> \\"I could...show that in all Nations of the world, progress of the Mind proportioned itself exactly to the needs, which Peoples received from Nature, or to which circumstances subjected them, and consequently to the passions, which inclined them to satisfy these needs.\\" (B1, p142)<br /><br />These \\"passions\\" of men, are the desires of men. Hopefully, through the \\"progress of Mind\\", a man can learn more and more about what is to beneficial for his survival needs through experiences and make better actions based on free will.<br /><br />There remains, however, a gap between desire and what is beneficial for the body. There is an apple, but how will a person actually learn that he should desire the apple? This takes place with the mechanism of pleasure and pain, which God equipped man with. Although Rousseau does not talk about it directly, but for his system to work, pleasure and pain must be the markers of experiences, distinguishing between what is good for one's survival and what is not. For example, when a hungry man eat three apples after he has not eaten for three days, his agony of hunger will decrease; he has learnt that apples will make him feel less pain, and hence, the marker of pleasure is mentally attached to the image of an apple. Rousseau writes,<br /><br /> \\"The passions, in turn, owe their origin to our needs, and their progress to our knowledge.\\" (B1, p142)<br /><br />Indeed, the real form of this knowledge is an index mental association between events and pleasures and pain.<br /><br />Pleasure as the indication of goodness works out very well in the state of nature when everyone only has command over the limited goods which he gains through his own labor, however, the indications cause troubles in the civil society.<br /><br />The Change<br /><br />A change in environment and condition brings upon a challenge never before faced by men-their independent labor can no longer guarantee their survival. It might be that the weather used to allow hunting during all seasons, but suddenly winter turned dreary and cold and hunters must hunt enough during summer so that there would be enough food reserved for winter. This doubling of work, sadly, was too much work for one man. Forced by their memory of hunger from the last winter, the hunters begin working together with one another. They must now act uniformly. Maybe one wants to hunt at 5pm and the other wants to hunt at 4pm, but there can only be one time. Hence, the two have succumbed their original freedom and force to their union. As Rousseau writes,<br /><br />\\"Now, since men cannot engender new forces, but only united and direct those that exist, they are left with no other means of self-preservation than to form, by aggregation, a sum of forces that might prevail over those obstacles' resistance, to set them in motion by a single impetus, and make them act in concert. (B2, p49)<br /><br />This decision to bind together, like every other decision man makes, was based on man's ability to choose based on desires his \\"free agent\\".<br /><br />The Problem<br /><br />From the perfect state of natural freedom, man freely chose to form society after they have been forced by necessity to abandon their old way of independent life.<br /><br />This lose of independence, however, is horrible because it made it easy for one group to usurp another's freedom to enjoy his labor. Rousseau writes the misery of the civil life,<br /><br /> \\"Now,I should very much like to have it explained to me what kind of misery there can be for a free being, whose heart is at peace, and body in health. I ask, which of the two, Civil life or natural life, is more liable to become intolerable to those who enjoy it? Almost all the People we see around us complain of their existence, and some even deprive themselves of it as far as they are able, and the combination of divine and human Laws hardly suffices to stop this disorder...\\" (B1, p150)<br /><br />This misery arises out of cooperation, but cooperation itself is not misery. Maybe one person before the union liked to hunt at 5pm and the other wants to hunt at 4pm, but the necessity for them to choose one time is not bad because that is a necessary cost for them to work together, and if they did not work together, both would die of hunger.<br /><br /> The problem is with free will. Although free will was fully beneficial in the state of nature, but back then, everyone was independent, and one's freedom to enjoy the fruits of labor is guaranteed. Now, a man's free will is still acting according to the signals of pleasures and pain, however, the fruits of people's laboring is no longer free from the intervention of others, or, in another word, some are now able to interfere with other's fruits of labor, and they will interfere for the pleasures of life.<br /><br />Free Will is Detrimental to Life in The Civil Society<br /><br />In the state of nature, every savage was fully independent and gained what they needed for the preservation of their lives, however, in the state of civil society, no one is independent anymore, and all must work together for common survival.<br /><br />As people work together, there must be a leader who will give directions when there is no time for voting, and this leader will have more power than others in the group. This power might include control over members' money/goods contribution (tax) to the group and the management of the distributionof group's produces of labor.<br /><br />The leader, however, still has his free will, which follows the signals given off by desires and pleasures. In one case, the leader perhaps has great liking for eating apples, so he tries to get as many apples as he could. As he acts according to his free will, he takes away from his members the apples that actually resulted from their labor. Although in the short term the leader is happy, but not only has he deprived others of their necessities of life, he has also endangered his own future necessities which might be deprived by future leaders who might usurp his power. Anger arise amongst people, and the group is ruled by force, Rousseau writes,<br /><br />\\"Besides, regardless of how they painted their usurpations, they realized well enough that they were only based on a precarious and abusive right, and that since they had been acquired solely by force, force could deprive them of them without their having any reason for complaint.\\" (B1, p170)<br /><br />A community where everyone tries to use force to cheat as much as he could out of the public coffer is bound to be detrimental for the preservation of life, which desires were suppose to serve for in the first place.<br /><br /> Desire is achieving the opposite of its true ends because free will was only appropriate for the state of nature. In the natural state, one could only get as much apple as one's labor could obtain, and the danger was always not getting enough rather than too much, therefore, desires were designed to direct people to get as much apples as possible while they could. In the civil society, people can get the fruits of others' labors if they are in a power position to do so, and hence, the constant drive for satisfying desires became hurtful for all. Desires and free will are therefore the cause of the misery of civil life.  Rousseau writes of this misery,<br /><br />\\"Without needlessly drawing out these details, everyone must see that since ties of servitude are formed solely by men's mutual dependence and the reciprocal needs that unite them, it is impossible to subjugate a man without first having placed him in the position of being unable to do without another; a situation which, since it does not obtain in the state of Nature, leaves everyone in it free of the yoke, and render vain the Law of the stronger.\\" (B1, p159)<br /><br /> What makes the problem of desire even worse is that when men came to work together, they begin to see differences between each other, and these differences contribute to who must lead and who must follow. With experience, one learns that those who lead obtain more plentiful shares of goods and even get to take away goods that in fact belong to others; everyone, therefore, driven by the desires for pleasures, wants to have the qualities which will make him a leader either by force or eloquence. This competition only intensifies people's desires since now their desires are not only driven by thoughts of pleasure but also fears of the pains of deprivation if he does not win. Rousseau gives a poetic description of the first signs of jealousy and competition,<br /><br />\\"Young people of the opposite sex live in adjoining Huts, the transient dealings demanded by Nature soon lead to others, no less sweet and more permanent as a result of mutual visits. They grow accustomed to attend to different objects and to make comparisons; imperceptibly they acquire ideas of merit and beauty which produce sentiments of preference.\\" (B1, p165)<br /><br />The result of these all, of course, was intensified subjugation that goes against the preservation of life. People all made the right choice to join the civil society, it was an act of necessity, but now, the necessity has harmed them.<br /><br /> One might hope that in the civil society, men will learn through experience that what is truly in the long term beneficial to them, and their desires then could change. But physical pleasures and pain which direct desires are by nature short-sighted-they were developed in the age which Rousseau describes as when men could only make direct correlations for simple things that quickly show result.<br /><br /> The only solution is to strip away the free will of men.<br /><br />General Will<br /><br /> The savage men were free and happy, but to survive in the new conditions of life, men must make their biggest adaptation yet, and that is to get rid of their free will; the goal of this is to free everyone's fruits of labor from usurpations. Men must let go of the idea of making decisions for themselves individually, and endow with all their powers the public as the only source of power. The group must still act uniformly, because only through the collective efforts of all could anyone obtain the necessities of life, however, the decisions of the group must be made by all its members rather than a particular man or group of men. Individual freedom will merely be a nice relic to be treasured. Rousseau writes,<br /><br /> \\"Each of us puts his person and his full power in common under the supreme direction of the general will; and in a body we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole.\\" (B2, p50)<br /><br />Granted, it will be impossible to change what man desires, but the goal is to build the civil society with laws such that individuals would not gain the power take more than what his labor truly deserves. These laws must represent the general interest of the whole people. As Rousseau writes,<br /><br /> \\"But when the whole people enacts statutes for the whole people it considers only itself, and if a relation is then formed, it is between the entire object from one point of view and the entire object from another point of view, with no division of the whole. Then the matter with regard to which the statute is being enacted is general, as is the enacting will. It is this act which I call law. (B2, p67)<br /><br />To have an effective civil society is to have one body with one voice, the unity of the civil society must be preserved in its true form for there to be laws that are truly just-laws that truly take away all the selfish desires of men inherited from an older age and guaranttee the preservation of life.<br /><br /> Despite good wishes, it is very easy for the civil society to fall into the dangers of promoting particular interest with the guise of general interest. To distinguish the false general will from the true ones, there are two questions to consider. One question is what is the interest of the whole, and the other is how to best achieve the interest of the whole. For the first question, the interest of the whole must be the same for all or the actions or laws must not hurt anyone for the benefits of others; it is precisely because people all have the same fundamental interest or all expected to share equal benefits of society that they formed together into the civil society. For the second question, people do not all have to believe in the same method to achieve of the society's common goal.<br /><br /> The following example is when a particular interest goes against the interest of the whole. If all the women in the country, supposing that there are more women than men, decide that the nation must change all men's bathrooms into women's bathrooms because women need more space for toileting, they could certainly win a majority vote. This, however, does not reflect the general interest because the resources of the nation belong to all its members since everyone has contributed their share to the nation's prosperity. Women, by acting according to their desires for big bathrooms, have taken away the fruits of the men's labor.  Rousseau writes,<br /><br />\\"...if individuals were left some rights, then, since there would be no common superior who might adjudicate between them and the public, each, being judge in his own case on some issue, would soon claim to be so on all, the state of nature would subsist and theassociation necessarily become tyrannical or empty\\" (B2, p50)<br /><br />These women have reserved some rights that they should have given up, and although their law might make their lives easier, but men will one day rise up with their pent-up anger, and the world shall become \\"tyrannical\\" and \\"empty\\".<br /><br /> A law regarding traffic rules, on the other hand, should certainly be decided by majority choice. If 51% of the nation believes that it is better to drive on the left side of the road and 49% think the right side is safer, then the majority action must be obeyed because the intent from both sides is to guarantee safety.<br /><br />Addtionally, \\"The general will would always result from the large number of small differences\\". There will always be small differences of interest. For example, some people will want to start working at 8 and others at 9, and if one time must be picked, some are going to be happier than others, however, both are general will, because each person is still been awarded the produces of his labor, and the fundamental interest of survival is preserved for all.<br /><br />Rousseau writes, the duty of his social contract is:<br /><br />\\"To find a form of association that will defend and protect the person and goods of each associate with the full common force, and by means of which each, uniting with all, nevertheless obey only himself and remain as free as before.\\"<br /><br />Rousseau has fully achieved this end. In the civil society, one will be as free as before in two ways. First of all, although the individual no longer has free will, there arises a new individual that is whole of the civil community. To say that this individual is free does not mean that the will of each element within it is undertaken, but rather that the will of the community is guaranteed. Through the will of the community, which treats all its elements equally, the people of the community gain the preservation of life, which was always the goal of free will.Secondly, the loss of individual free will is compensated by the preservation of the individual freedom to keep the produces of one's own labor, and this freedom is just vital as free will was.<br /><br />Alas, \\"Man were born free, everywhere they are in chains\\" !<br /><br />To conclude, the chains of life is not the social orders which men must follow in order to preserve their lives. If this is any chain, this is the happy necklace that proudly shines the glory of commonwealths. In fact, free will is not the chain either-it is also glorious and wonderful for it is the singular mechanism which allowed men to adapt to environments and prosper everywhere. The chain lies in the misapplication of free will, which could only be corrected by subjugating the individual will to the public will, lest the goal of preserving life, the goal of freedom itself, is unfulfilled. Some might argue that this essay does not give enough considerations to how the modern way of life might play under Rousseau's system. Surely, many people today in developed nations no longer worry about the preservation of life, but are busying themselves with trying to earn millions of dollars, however, the situation now in fundamentally the same as in a world with less economic developments which Rousseau was writing for. A nation should still act according to the general will, and the people should still never let their free will infringe upon others' freedom to enjoy the products of their own labor. When some pursue excessively particular interests, others might not be deprived to death in the society, but they will be driven by the emotions which grew out from the need for self-preservation to revolt and fight against the corrupting authorities.	2005-03-12

Thus, despite Locke's assertion that his legislature is supreme, it can not be, since according to Locke's own definition, the foundation of the legislature's supreme power only lies in the complete protection of the people's property by the legislature.<br /><br />  Locke asserts that the Legislative power is supreme in the commonwealth (Chapter 18). This legislative power, however, is only supreme because it protects the life and property of the people. He says,<br /><br />\\"And thus the Community perpetually retains a Supream Power of saving themselves from the attempts and designs of any Body, even of their Legislators, whenever they shall be so foolish, or so wicked, as to lay and carry on designs against the Liberties and Properties of the Subject. For no Man, or Society of Men, having a power to deliver up their Preservation, or Society of Men, having a Power to deliver up their Preservation, or consequently the means of it, to the Absolute Will and arbitrary Dominion of another.\\" (p367)<br /><br />The key here is that \\"no Man\\" can give up the right to protect his property and liberty; this means the legislative power does not gain its supreme power by protecting some people's person and property, but everyone's person and property. Sadly, despite Locke's genuine efforts to establish a government that was not \\"so foolish, or so wicked\\", his supreme legislature will not protect everyone's person and property. This is not caused by the corruption of the members of the legislature or their promotion of secret laws; instead, Locke's system is intrinsically flawed because the legislature acts according to majority vote.<br /><br />  Locke believes that the interest of the majority vote is the interest of the whole, and the majority vote in a commonwealth must decide the actions of the commonwealth. Locke writes of the necessity for majority rule as follows,<br /><br />\\"It is necessary the Body should move that way whither the greater force carries it, which is the consent of the majority: or else it is impossible it should act or continue one Body, one Community, which the consent of every individual that united into it, agreed that it should.\\" (p332)<br /><br />Locke makes no mistakes here-a government will never be able to function if every action it takes must obtain the consent of every citizen. Nevertheless, although for most of the time, the differences between majority vote and minority vote merely show differences in opinions about how best to achieve a common goal, it is unavoidable that sometimes the differences of opinion will represent fundamental split of interest. With this unavoidable fissure, the laws selected by the majority vote are bound to hurt the person and property of the minority.<br /><br />  America before the American Civil War is an example where a fundamental fissure in society appeared. In the United States of the late 19th century, there was a clear difference of interest between the slave owning plantation economy of the south and the free labor industrial economy of the north. The Yankees, through the legislature, was enforcing economic laws such as high tariff and low silver excavation that protected northern manufacturing industries but hurt the production and exports of southern farming produces. Since the legislature of the United States was controlled by the more populous northern states, the south felt that its interest was always trumped by the majority. This fissure made the legislature no longer a source of supreme power in the eyes of southerners, and it was the cause of the Civil War.<br /><br />  The American civil war is an extreme example, but lesser examples of differencesin interest abound. In one case of the 1980s, the conservative British PM Margaret Thatcher recognized that it was not in the interest of the majority of the British people to keep on subsidizing coal workers with billions of tax money, and decided to let the market determine how the coalmines should be ran. Margaret Thatcher was justly representing the interest of the people who gave her and her party power to sit in the House of Commons. The coalminers, a minority interest group, however, were extremely upset because they would lose jobs if Thatcher succeeded since their high-cost mines could not compete in a market economy. The government and the mineworkers battled on the streets for a year before the issue was resolve.<br /><br />  Whether the PM or the mineworkers had more justice on their side is topic for another essay, but it is clear that fundamental differences of interests between different interest groups exist.<br /><br />  Reading Locke, nevertheless, one might come to the conclusion that the above kinds of conflicts of economic interest only arise from people's greed for obtaining what they do not need-the northern capitalists and the southern plantation owners were only fighting for ever more slaves and mills, and perhaps there should have never been any coalmines if only there was not so much economic development which only produce excess and corruption. One might say that in a true Lockeian society, there will never be such battles for money, and as evidence, one find Locke saying,<br /><br />\\"God has given us all things richly, I Tim. Vi. 17. is the Voice of Reason confirmed by Inspiration. But how far has he given it us? To enjoy. As much as any one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoils; so much he may be his labour fix a Property in.\\" (p290)<br /><br />The above idea on the outset seems to put a tremendous limit on the property one can obtain, and this limit promotes a form of simple agricultural society where everyone has moderate property and happiness.<br /><br />  If Locke really does believe that all industrial and expansionary economics are bad and does limit his Commonwealth to the moderate agricultural form, then the legislature could be supreme because when everyone has similar land and make similar produces, there can not be fundamental differences in interest. Nevertheless, Locke is not against industrial and economic expansions since he is not against money, which is the bloodline of economic developments.<br /><br />  Despite the gross inequality that comes with money, Money is acceptable to Locke because it accumulates imperishable goods. Locke believes that although a person should not try to hoard a hundred bananas a day for his own consumption, he should be able to obtain and keep what will be of lasting preservative value. In fact, he sets no limits on such imperishable goods; and the accumulation of imperishable goods is exactly what money accomplishes. Locke writes,<br /><br />  \\"They having by a tacit and voluntary consent found out a way, how a man may fairly possess more land than he himself can use the product of, by receiving in exchange for overplus, Gold and Silver, which may be hoarded up without injury to any one, these metals not spoileing or decaying in the hands of the possessor.\\" (p302)<br /><br />As this passage shows, Gold and Silver do not perish, and therefore, they do not represent wastes. Although they cause inequality, they are \\"fair\\" in that they are the \\"overplus\\" of<br /><br />one's labour that do not take away the interest of others.<br /><br />  One with Gold and Silver might purchase a nice English country estate, some nice carriages, or even a Cotton machine. Locke, by accepting these imperishable goods procured with money strips away the supreme power that the legislature could have had in an equal agricultural state. This accumulation of imperishable goods is bound to create differing classes in societies with the capitalists having oneinterest in the law and the poor having another and also create further interest sub-groups. Since the legislature is bound to pass laws that have majority vote (even when the group represents the minority population), the property and liberty of the minority group will always be compromised.<br /><br />  One might argue at this point that although it is clear that the interest of the minority might be deprived, but when people united together to form civil society, they made the contract with each other that each will be governed by the choice of the majority (P331). They are right, however, this contract is conditional. To understand the conditionality, the rationality for coming into civil society must be clear. Locke writes,<br /><br />  \\"To avoid this State of War (wherein there is no appeal but to Heaven, and wherein every the least difference is apt to end, where there is no Authority to decide between the Contenders) is one great reason of Mens putting themselves into Society, and quitting the State of nature.\\" (p282)<br /><br />The above quote and Locke's ideas about majority rule together show that Locke is offering two choices for living: either one joins the society or he stays in the \\"State of War\\". If he chooses the latter, he keeps intact the whole of his property and rights, but must embrace the danger that there can be no \\"Authority\\" to protect his property and rights. If he joins the commonwealth, he will have to pay a \\"fee\\", which is the cost of the damage to his property majority action might do, however, this loss will be recuperated overtime from the long term security offered by the Commonwealth. Citizens, therefore, only gave up their irrevocable right to property in order to keep their property.<br /><br />  The balance of benefits changes, however, when one is only getting properties taken away by the society, but receives nothing in return. As the groups support different laws in the legislature through their representatives, the minority will not be paying a \\"fee\\" for long term security but will be simply be constantly suppressed by the majority. This dictatorship of the majority is no better for the minority than the state of nature when they still kept the right to punish others in their hands.<br /><br />  In any Commonwealth that uses money as the medium of exchange, there must arise differences of interests that make the legislature a place where majority interest will trump minority interest. Thus, individual liberty for some will be preserved, but for others, it will not be. The legislature will never be able to protect the interest of everyone, and therefore can not have supreme power if the source of the supreme power is truly, as Locke claims, the people.rm of simple agricultural society where everyone has moderate property and happiness.  <br /> <br />        If Locke really does believe that all industrial and expansionary economics are bad and does limit his Commonwealth to the moderate agricultural form, then the legislature could be supreme because when everyone has similar land and make similar produces, there can not be fundamental differences in interest.

Mansfield, University of Chicago Press; 2nd edition (September 1, 1998) <br />On Law, Morality, and Politics, translated by Richard J. Regan, Hackett Pub Co Inc; 1 edition (April 1, 1988) <br /> <br />The Nature of Man as Viewed by Machiavelli and St. Aquinas <br /> <br />        The Prince by Machiavelli and the Summa Theologiae by Saint Thomas Aquinas ostensibly offered differing visions of the nature of men; Machiavelli believed men were naturally selfish and Aquinas believed men naturally strived for the common good. However, a deeper look would reveal that their ideas of personal and common interest match, and furthermore, the unnatural and \\"immoral\\" actions supported by Machiavelli resulted from necessities, and hence were allowed by Aquinas.  <br /> <br />         To Machiavelli, men in nature were \\"half beast, half man\\" (M69), and his theory developed specifically in regard to the nature of the prince, their subjects and rivals. <br /> <br />         Machiavelli was concerned with the nature of the prince the most. From Oliverroto to the Romans, Machiavelli described the prince as a hungry political animal who advanced his interests in jungles of beasts. He gave approval to the prince's desires for enlargements, writing, \\"it is a very natural and ordinary thing to desire to acquire, and always, when men do it who can, they will be praised or not blamed.\\" (M14) <br /> <br />       To Machiavelli, the prince was also justified in employing harsh and cunning methods against the others who became fearful of him. Among Machiavelli's paragons for rulers was Oliverotto of Fermo, who killed his uncle and \\"the first men of Fermo\\" in a backroom (M36), and the Roman emperor Severus, who suppressed his people for the benefits of his soldiers (M78), and also Cesare Borgia, who fooled his people into blaming his minister Remirro for the injustices inflicted on them and then \\"cut into two pieces\\" the minister to appease them. Concerning the consequences of these actions, Machiavelli wrote, \\"So let a prince win and maintain his state: the means will always be judged honorable, and will be praised by everyone.\\" (M71) <br /> <br />       Since a prince must know his subjects in order to dominate them, Machiavelli also spent much time discussing the nature of the people in relations to the prince. To Machiavelli, the people were like tall grasses on a windy plateau: they had no ambitions, only wanting \\"not to be oppressed\\" (M39); their nature was \\"variable\\" (M24), and could be blown from one prince to another \\"when they find good in the present\\" (M96); the simple common people were also \\"taken in by appearance\\" (M58) and so could be easily fooled (Mchapter 18); however, despite the weakness of each person, the people were powerful as a whole, and a prince must rely on them to achieve glory, because \\"a prince who founds on the people...will never find himself deceived by them.\\" (M41)  <br /> <br />      The prince must also consider the nature of his rivals, including other princes, mercenary troops and the lords surrounding him. His rivals were \\"wicked and do not observe faith with you (him)\\" (M69), and since they also desired \\"to command and oppress the people.\\" (M39), the prince must be both \\"the fox and the lion\\" (M69) in his battles against them. He must cunningly trap his enemies, and must also be skilled in the art of war (M58), since only \\"armed prophets conquered\\". (M24) <br /> <br />       To Aquinas, however, human were not animals because \\"irrationals creatures, however, do not partake thereof (reason) in a rational manner\\" (T20). Men should be ashamed when they were \\"compared to senseless beasts and made like to them\\", because that meant they had refused the grace of heaven and \\"turned his (their) back on God\\". (T28) <br /> <br />         To Aquinas, the higher goals in life must never be glory or honor. Just like Plato and Aristotle before him, Aquinas said, \\"perfection of virtue consists chiefly in withdrawing man from undue pleasures, to which, above all, man is inclined.\\" (T57). To Aquinas, since God \\"is the creator of all things\\" (T34), and since \\"man is ordained to an end of eternal happiness which is inproportionate to man's natural faculty\\" (T23), the ultimate goal of life should be to get invited \\"to the kingdom of heaven\\" (T25). <br /> <br />        St. Thomas put forth his version of human nature as he treated the question of \\"Natural Law\\". To him, central to human nature was reason; he wrote, reason \\"is the first principle of human acts\\" (T12). As Aristotle pointed out before, reason was what differentiated men from other animals, and Aquinas believed that from reason arose men's natural striving toward common interest. Aquinas wrote, <br /> <br />       \\"The first principle in practical matters, which are the object of the practical reason, is the last end, and the last end of human life is bliss or happiness, as stated above. Consequently, the law must needs regard principally the relationship to happiness. Moreover, since every part is ordained to the whole as imperfect to perfect, and since a single man is a part of the perfect community, the law must needs regard properly the relationship to universal happiness.\\" (T14) <br /> <br />       Aquinas's sanguine outlook that men were brothers with a common happiness to share stood in stark contrast to the bitter picture that Machiavelli drew. Furthermore, not only would Aquinas have rejected the ends of the prince as unnatural, since the prince's methods were not virtuous and unjust, the methods were also unnatural (T146). Inheriting the principles of Aristotle, Aquinas wrote, \\"justice is a habit whereby a man renders to each one his due by constant and perpetual will\\" (T145). This principle demanded that one must naturally not take more than he had given, and also that men should never be unfaithful or lie, because by lying one took away from others the information that rightly belonged to others. Machiavelli's shrewd political advices for the prince to \\"appear all mercy, all faith, all honesty\\" (M70) was therefore unnatural and detrimental to natural happiness.   <br /> <br />       Be natural was important, because to Aquinas, although natural reason itself was not salvation, but this road of justice and common good lead men to the divine law, which was \\"about men in relation to God either in this life or in the life to come\\". (T87) The \\"intellectual virtues\\" gained from reason was the basis for the \\"moral virtues\\" (T87) which through the \\"the revelation of grace\\" (T25) saved men from \\"original sin\\".  <br /> <br />      Shaking the house of men with ostensibly different concepts about good and bad, God and glory, Machiavelli and Aquinas ostensibly pointed the world in opposing directions. One in a Machiavellian world might expect constant World Wars, while one in Aquinas' world might expect living peacefully and working with others for \\"common good\\" as they reserved the energies for eternal happiness in heaven. Nevertheless, despite their differences, Machiavelli and Aquinas had great similarities.   <br /> <br />       Most importantly, in reality, private interest and common interest bear little differences. To succeed, the prince must give benefits to the people, and for the prince to always succeed, he must always give benefits to the people. The preservation of the regime, which was Machiavelli's central goal, necessarily resulted in the prince's interest matching with the people's. Machiavelli gave the prince his formula for success with the following,  <br /> <br />     \\"He should inspire his citizens to follow their pursuits quietly...So that one person does not fear to adorn his possessions for fear that they be taken away from him, and another to open up a trade for fear of taxes. But he should prepare rewards for whoever wants to do these things, and for anyone who thinks up any way of expanding his city or his state.\\" (M91)  <br /> <br />       From this, Machiavelli clearly believed that it was vital for a successful prince to not just care about his private good, but the interest of every individual, which together made up the common interest of the city. Aquinas supported the same view that the prince had the same interest as the people when he wrote, \\"common good belongs either to the whole people or to someone who is the vicegerent of the whole people.\\" (T15) Clearly, the ruler or vicegerent could carry out the \\"common interest\\" of the people.  <br /> <br />        Against the above point, one could argue that the people never made the prince their \\"vicegerent\\", but according to Aquinas, the people were not to choose their prince, for he said, \\"the Lord did not leave the choice of a king to the people but reserved this to Himself.\\" (T117) One could still argue that God did not choose Machiavelli's princes either, but according to Saint Augustine, all earthly events happened under God's divine foreknowledge; that meant men like Hiero of Syracuse and Agathocles, who strived to be princes, were princes that God planned for. Machiavelli wrote, \\"God does not want to do everything, so as not to take free will from us\\" (M103), but still, free will itself was a gift from God, and so God was always choosing princes.   <br /> <br />       In the same vein of thought, from Aquinas's arguments, it was also obvious that common interest was only valuable because each person would be benefited as a member of the common pool. He wrote,  <br /> <br />       \\"it is necessary for man to live in society with his fellows, because by himself he could not secure those things necessary for life if he would remain in a solitary existence....In a city, however, (which is a complete community), there is as much as suffices for all the necessities of life, yet still much more in a province because of the need for defense and of the mutual aid of allies against the public enemy.\\" (T266) <br /> <br />        From the above, one could without doubt see that although Aquinas did not allow for \\"honor or glory\\" to be the ends of life, selfishness in itself should not be dismissed as unchristian and unnatural. In fact, Christianity could only be valuable in that it can save one who believed in it, but not anyone else. <br /> <br />        Despite common interest, many people might still consider the faithlessness and suppression of prince antithetical to Aquinas's teachings of human nature. But in Aquinas's description of the natural law, he stated that although \\"certain proper conclusions\\" of the natural law could not be changed, but \\"it may be changed in some particular cases of rare occurrence.\\" (T53) Men were naturally reasonable, and reason commanded man to be flexible according to situations. Aquinas gave the example that although normally the gate of a city must be closed, it should be opened for \\"certain citizens who are defenders of the city\\" at times of war. (T75) Therefore, it would be wrong to condemn Machiavelli without \\"consideration of the various circumstances\\" (T85). <br /> <br />      The violence that Machiavelli supported arose from necessity, thus making them \\"various circumstances\\". Machiavelli wrote, the prince should \\"not depart from good, when possible, but know how to enter into evil, when forced by necessity.\\" (M70)  <br /> <br />       Machiavelli's most appalling example of proper violence regarded the Romans; Machiavelli said the emperors should \\"escape the hatred of the most powerful class\\" (M62) and therefore must support the soldiers even at the cost of suppressing the people. However, the emperors did not do this out of their will, but Rome's giant standing army forced them to choose. The alternative of supporting the army was internal war, which was worse for the people.  <br /> <br />       Aquinas gave full approval to this kinds of actions when he wrote, \\"if, indeed, there is not an excess of tyranny, it is more profitable to put up with a milder tyranny for the time being than, by opposing the tyrant, to run into many dangers more grievous than the tyranny itself.\\" (T267) And certainly, Machiavelli criticized those Roman emperors, such as Commodus and Antoninus, who went beyond the boundary of necessary and milder tyranny and exercised their \\"rapacity on the people\\". (M80) Since these emperors did not comply with common interest, they \\"fell victim to conspiracy\\" (M80). <br /> <br />       The necessity to act against nature did not last for ever, and Machiavelli wrote that evil should be \\"done at a stroke, out of the necessity to secure oneself\\" (M37); When the necessity for severe suppression did not exist, Machiavelli warned that the prince must always \\"abstain from the property of his citizens and his subjects, and from their women; and if he also needs to proceed against someone's life, he must do it when there is suitable justification and manifest cause for it.\\" (M67) <br /> <br />      Machiavelli's support for future happiness at the cost of  <br />one time evil was also supported by Aquinas. The Saint wrote, \\"it may happen, however, that even a good king, without being tyrant, may take away the sons and make them tribunes and centurions and may take many things from his subjects in order to secure the common weal.\\" (T119) He also wrote \\"the purpose of human law is to lead men to virtue, not suddenly but gradually\\" (T68). Aquinas' words were right, any goals took time to achieve, and sometimes, the path toward good might even lead in the direction of evil in order to avoid the greater danger of crossing a deep river or snow-peaked mountains.  <br /> <br />      When necessities did not exist, the political systems that Machiavelli supported were just and good, and hence natural. In one example that Machiavelli mentioned, after his initial acts, Cesare Borgia \\"set up a civil court in the middle of the province, with a most excellent president, where each city had its advocate\\" (M30). Thus, although Cesare Borgia found Romagna \\"full of robberies, quarrels, and every other kind of insolence\\" (M29), after his initial harsh measures have been put in place, the citizens \\"had begun to taste well-being\\". (M29) In another case, Machiavelli praised the French king for his establishment of a parliament for the interest of the noble and \\"a third judge\\" to protect the interest of the people. (M75) Machiavelli also said that in regard to his ministers, the prince must also \\"become upset when he learns that anyone has any hesitation to speak it (truth) to him.\\" (M95). Aquinas wrote that \\"rule of one man ought to be what we above all choose\\", but only feared that the prince might \\"easily stoop to tyranny\\" (T267). Here, Machiavelli's ideal monarchies aimed at avoiding tyranny.  <br /> <br />         After the naturalness of the means and ends of the Machiavellian prince has been discussed, some might still worry that by allowing people to pursue their desires, Machiavelli's world would be filled with constant warfare. However, they should note that Machiavellians' methods would only be useful when existing nations were not benefiting their people and were not armed. Machiavelli mentioned the German principalities that \\"fear neither him [their emperor] nor any neighboring power, because they are fortified\\" and because there was \\"provision for the common people\\" for a year. (Mchapter 9) He concluded by saying, \\"thus a prince who has a strong city and does not make himself hated cannot be attacked.\\" (M44) And internally, as long as the prince was not \\"rapacious and not a usurper of the property and the women of his subjects\\" (M72), he needed to have little fears of conspiracies. Therefore, Machiavellian wars only rose when there existed deep problems in states, problems the Machiavellian princes must resolve with necessary actions.  <br /> <br />        As said before, there exist fundamental differences between Aquinas' and Machiavelli's ideas: despite the similarity between selfishness and common interest, Machiavelli's prince's selfish interest lay in the glory he searched, while Aquinas's men's selfish interest lay in the salvation they gained. To Christian, men's salvation through the eternal grace of God was far more important than any practical happenings on earth; but to Machiavelli, it seemed that the salvation of life lay not in heaven but in the glorification of one's deed in the eternal eyes of posterity. However, the God-talk was a part of the divine law, and if one merely compared Aquinas's of human and natural law which supported the common good and allowed for necessities to Machiavelli's support for necessary evils and private interest, it should be clear that both the means and temporal ends of the Machiavellian prince were within Aquinas' boundaries of human nature; they were simply looking at the same human world from different angles.	2004-12-07

He believes that people are naturally different in their intelligence and moral qualities, that these qualities naturally give them differing arete (this word has been translated into:goodness, excellence, merit and virtue), and that they should naturally be given different political rights based on these arete. However, Aristotle does not have any viable methods for detecting the nature of people. Instead, he artificially locks rulers, citizens and slaves into three unequal classes based on wealth and birth, and he tries to appease the lower classes with deceptive schemes. From its very core, Aristotle's proportional equality is unfair and does not allow freedom.           In Book Three, Aristotle establishes the theory that political equality does not mean everyone getting the same as everyone else. He believes that different groups of people in the city have equally valid claims to political rights based on differing criteria. To him, the different interest groups are, \\"The people at large, the wealthy, the better sort, the one who is best of all, the tyrant\\" (1281a11)           In fact, Aristotle states that political equality for one of these groups will always be inequality for the other groups. He claims,           \\"For example, justice is considered to mean equality. It does mean equality-but equality for those who are equal, and not for all. Again inequality is considered to be just; and indeed it is-but only for those who are unequal, and not for all.\\" (1280a7)           After rejecting the distribution of political rights according to the interests of various groups, Aristotle states that the right basis by which political rights should be conferred is the degree of arete one contributes to the city. Through this, proportional equality could be achieved. He writes,           \\"Those who contribute most to this association have a greater share inthe city than those who are equal to them (or even greater) in free birth and descent, but unequal in civic excellence (arete), or than those who surpass them in wealth but are surpassed by them in excellence (arete).\\" (1281a2)            The rationale for this proportional equality based on arete is simple: the city \\"exists for the sake of a good life*\\" (1252b27), and the good life is only achieved with arete. Therefore, naturally those who have more arete should be given more political rights because they can best utilize the resources of the city to make life good for all. Aristotle establishes the full connection between good life of the city and arete in Book Seven.            This connection can be summarized as the following: the city is for the best life possible, the best life is the life of happiness, happiness requires action, and action is the exercise of \\"arete\\".  Aristotle first defines the good life as the life that aims at happiness. He says that the object of the city \\"is the best and highest life possible. The highest good is happiness...\\" (1328a26). Aristotle also proposes that \\"happiness is a state of activity; and the actions of just and temperate men bring many fine things to fulfillment.\\" (1325a16) The purpose of activity or action, \\"praxis\\", however, is exactly to do or achieve \\"arete\\". Aristotle writes, happiness is realized by \\"the actualization and perfect practice (praxis) of goodness (arete)\\" (1328a26).             The structure of the differing arete is as follows: Aristotle states that the rulers/statesmen have the arete of good man which allows them to rule, the citizens have the arete of good citizen that allows them to rule and be ruled, and the non-citizens/slaves have only enough arete that they are condemned to obedience.             To Aristotle, the reason that people have different arete is that they naturally have different levels of intelligences and moral qualities. And since these qualities are what make a person and a city good, people are allotted proportionally equal but unequal political rights. On intelligence, he believes that some are just intrinsically better. For example, regarding slaves, he says,              \\"...(and this is the case with all whose function is bodily service, and who produce their best when they supply such service)-all such are by nature slaves...... if he participates in reason to the extent of apprehending it in another, though destitute of it himself.\\" (1254b16)             On moral qualities, in Chapter One of Book Seven, Aristotle says that external goods are not as important as moral goods are for achieving happiness, however, only some are capable of achieving high morality. He says,           \\"you can see for yourselves that the happy life-no matter whether it consists in pleasure, or goodness, or both-belongs more to those who have cultivated their character and mind to the uttermost...\\" (1323a21)            In Chapter Two, he makes it clear that the statesmen and philosophers, in another word, the rulers are most fit for the cultivation of morality and intelligence, which combines to be their arete. And since the goodness of the state needs morality, those statesmen and philosophers should rule. He writes,           \\"Here, we may say, are the two ways of life-the political and the philosophic-that are evidently chosen by those who have been most eager to win a reputation for goodness (arete), in our own and in previous ages...for whether individuals or cities are in question, wisdom must aim at the higher mark.\\" (1324a19)            Certainly, Aristotle is right in pointing out that there exist differences between people. For a state to operate well, the people who are more equipped for intellectual and moral tasks should have more political rights. And if there really are those who have no \\"deliberative elements\\" in their soul, then certainly those people should be under the command of a master if not a doctor. There is an identical interestbetween the good rulers and the ruled, which Aristotle rightly points out in Book One,           \\"The part and the whole, like the body and the soul, have an identical interest; and the slave is a part of the master, in the sense of being a living but separate part of his body. There is thus a community of interest, and a relation of friendship, between master and slave, when both of them naturally merit the position in which they stand.\\" (1255b4)           From the above summarizations of Aristotle's positions, it is clear that Aristotle's whole theory of proportional equality is based his belief that some have better moral and intellectual capabilities. However, although these qualities are important, the test that Aristotle uses for determining them is not an equal educational system in which all could compete equally or some ingenious device for detecting people's IQ, rather, the test is about people's wealth and birth. These are not the right standards by which one's abilities could be judged upon, and thus Aristotle's theory fails.              The importance of money and wealth is explicit in Aristotle's differentiation of the citizens from the non-citizens/slaves (the mechanics and laborers' works have a \\"servile character\\" [1277a29] ), and less explicit in his differentiation between the citizens and the rulers/statesmen. The first differentiation is as follows,           \\"There are thus good grounds for the claims to honor which are made by people of good descent, free birth, or wealth, since those who hold office must necessarily be free men and pay the property assessment. (A city could not be composed entirely of those without means, ay more than it could be composed entirely of slaves.) But we must add that if wealth and free birth are necessary elements, the qualities of being just and being a good soldier are also necessary......The one difference is that the first two elements are necessary for the simple existence of a city, and the last two for its good life.\\" (1283a3)          It is easy to look at the second part of this passage and be left with the impression that Aristotle is saying that money does not matter and that been just is the most important quality according to which one should be judged by. But the first part of this passage is far more important; it shows that Aristotle is building a city for the better off. As shown later in the book, Aristotle does not even consider the majority of the city citizens of the city. He says, \\"the conclusion which clearly follows is that we cannot regard the elements which are necessary for the existence of the city......as being `parts' of the city...\\" (1328a21). While the wealthier people must strive for intelligence and morality, try to be just and exercise their sacred political rights, the poor people are forgotten and are not even given the chance in the good constitution that Aristotle talks about.           Although it is obvious that wealth and birth are not \\"natural\\" qualities that define people, Aristotle still insists throughout the book that the non-citizens/slaves are naturally inferior. Aristotle believes they have no arete other than those that allow them to be subservient to others. In Book One, he says about the slaves,            \\"...in treating of slaves, that they were useful for the necessary purposes of life. It is clear, on that basis, that they need but little goodness (arete); only so much, in fact, as will prevent them from falling short of their duties through intemperance or cowardice.\\" (1260a24)           This idea of \\"naturalness\\" is easily disprove by the fact that Aristotle later says that what really makes the non-citizens/slaves, the mechanics and laborers, naturally bad is that they have no time for arete and the cultivation of their souls. He argues,           \\"The best form of city will not make the mechanic a citizen. Where mechanics are admitted to citizenship we shall have to say that the citizen excellence (arete) of which we have spoken cannot be attained by every citizen, by all who are simply free men, but can only be achieved by those who are free from the necessary tasks of life.\\" (1278a8)         This argument is nonsensical. All along, Aristotle has been saying that those who should receive no political powers are borne lacking the qualities that contribute to their arete. But here, by saying that citizens who do no hard-labor are better than mechanics and laborers simply because they have more time, Aristotle is indicating that the lower class lacks arete because of their lack of education, which is a social, not natural result. This is a gross contradiction.           The second differentiation between that of citizens and ruler/statesmen is trickier. Aristotle superficially says that the two are equal, but subtly there is difference.          The arete of the good citizens is to both be ruled and to rule. Aristotle writes,           \\"...the fact remains that the good citizen must possess the knowledge and the capacity requisite for ruling as well as for being ruled, and the excellence (arete) of a citizen may be defined as consisting in `a knowledge of rule over free men from both points of view'\\"(1277b7)              Aristotle frequently mentions this view that the ruler/statesman and the citizens are political equals and should rotate positions. He says in Book One that \\"the rule of a statesman is rule over free and equal persons.\\" (1255b20) He also says in Book Three when he tries to define citizenship that, \\"the citizen in this strict sense is best defined by the one criterion that he shares in the administration of justice and in the holding of office.\\" (1275a19)                            However, hypocrisy emerges when he defines the arete of ruler/statesmen, who are the only good men. Contrary to before, he differentiates between rulers and the citizens, and makes one class higher than the other. Aristotle says \\"practical wisdom is the only form of excellence (arete) which is peculiar to the ruler... the virtue (arete) of a person being ruled is not practical wisdom but correct opinion.\\" (1277b16)             This is strange. If \\"practical wisdom\\" is what distinguishes the ruler from the ruled, then, when the ruler becomes a citizen again, is he suppose to loss his \\"wisdom\\" and become someone who only has \\"opinion\\"? And if the citizens are suppose to have \\"a knowledge of rule from both points of view\\" as mentioned above, why is Aristotle saying here that they are only capable of \\"opinions\\", which is far inferior to knowledge.            Aristotle seems to be trying to fool most of the citizens into believing that they have equal rights as those who are ruling, while disenfranchising their rights at the same time. Aristotle does not explicitly say that wealth and birth would decide who should rule, but it follows from the arguments before regarding free time that they must. While many people could qualify as citizens if they are moderately well off (1279a25, in polity, the property requirement for citizenship is only arms), and could hence afford some leisure to cultivate their arete, but those most wealthy people who could spend all of their time for the cultivation of their soul must be the ones with the best qualities to rule.            To be sure, this hypocrisy in another form is apparent right from the First Book in Aristotle's discussion regarding woman. Although he calls the relationship between husband and wife the relationship of statesmen and citizens, he in fact subjugates women to man. He writes,            \\"In most cases where rule of the statesman's sort is exercised there is an interchange of ruling and being ruled: the members of a political association aim by their very nature at being equal and differing in nothing...the relation of the male to the female is permanently that in which the statesman stand to his fellow citizens.\\" (1259a37)            Aristotle is offering a grand contradiction within the space of a paragraph. He defines the relationship between masters and citizens as equal just before he says that one is \\"permanently\\" subjugated to the other, and yet, he still maintains that this relationship is indeed equal.              To be certain, Aristotle is right in that even today, those who are of good birth and wealth are more likely to be suitable for higher social positions than those who are from lower social-economic backgrounds. And when one looks at the current President of the USA, one could trace his family's wealth and fame three generations back. However, these people who are borne in families of higher social status are only what they are because of the good family influence and the good education they had.           The President went to the best of boarding schools, of universities and of businesses schools and his father was everything from the head of the USA to the head of the CIA; how is it fair to compare him to the Hispanic dish-washer whose parents worked illegally in that restaurant off the high-way, and who despite all eagerness to learn had to stay home to take care of his five younger siblings when he should have gong to highschool?          Aristotle is right in saying that people should achieve what their nature allows them to achieve, but he does not allow people's true nature to come into being. If slaves are given as much opportunity to study and work, then some of them surely will become philosophers, poets and other politicians. A city that allows that would be the city that is capable of achieving the best life possible for everyone.          Aristotle was intelligent, but he lacked the humility to realize that he did not know everything about human nature. There is nothing wrong with proportional equality, because the better should have, and have always had more power in states, but the key is how to find those good people who could contribute more to the arete of the society. Aristotle pointed out some of the right qualities that they need, but he wrote the Politics from the vantage point of the higher class, and classified people not according to their true abilities, but according to their social and economic conditions. In order to appease the lower social classes, he deceived them by giving them the rights of citizenship or by simply telling them that they are intrinsically incapable. And even for those who were citizens, he still tricks them into believing that they have more political rights they than really do. In this world, there is certainly no equality, not even traces of proportional equality, but most importantly, there is no freedom. There simply can be no freedom when people are locked into castes and can not realize their full potentials.	2004-11-23

For the brighter side, blue is the color of the earth and the sky, represents purity and beauty, and holds wonders to the limits beyond the eyes. For the darker side, it is synonyms with dreary, dismal, depressed and gloomy, and phrases like into-the-blue are associated with extreme exasperation. These two different and contrasting qualities of blue come into perfect match in The Great Gatsby, with the brighter blue matching the dreams and glories of Gatsby's life, and the darker blue matching the cold gray sadness of Gatsby's reality. The blue ocean and sky, the BLUE music, and the blue eyes of Dr. Eckleburg are three themes showing these contradictions. Blue is the color of Gatsby's tragedy.<br /><br />  Rain, ocean, and the swimming pool are where Gatsby's dreams once lay, but also where they vanish.  Gatsby loves Daisy, but he is always separated from her by blue water. At first it is the Atlantic Ocean, and then it is the water that separates East Egg from West Egg. Gatsby dreams of Daisy all this time and the blue distance is the medium through which his dreams grow into the grandest proportions. In fact, blue, the color without edge gave Gatsby too much room of imagination, and at the end, golden fruits turned out to be the same old apple trees. Really, who can argue that the ocean is not a beautiful thing, but yet with all the tragic dreams that this grand blue beauty empowered people to, is it not also the greatest curse?  Then there is the rain and the swimming pool, which further add to the sadness. It is significant that it rains both during the meeting of Gatsby and Daisy, and Gatsby `s burial. Gatsby's blue dreams was a cloud building up in all these years. It gets too heavy that it collapses with reality and falls on to the hard earth. Gatsby dies in his swimming pool, on one of the last days of summer, when the pool is drained. The pool represents his blue dream, and Gatsby dies in this pool of dream, or more accurately, was killed by his dream. At the end, the once flourishing bright hopes of light blue, becomes the smoke of gun shot, a darker blue dimmed by the setting sun.<br /><br />  Blue is the music of the 20th , it is popular, beautiful, creative, full of soul, and relieves people of their pains. Yet, the songs are about Poverty, hard times, Lost love, Sexuality, and Oppression. Listening to BLUE music is using sadness to defeat sadness itself, and this contradiction has the same quality as the contradiction of the color blue and of Gatsby's life. The \\"wailing\\" of the Beale Street Blue's \\"hopeless comment\\", while \\" a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust.\\"(P158) during Daisy's party with boys after she losses patience with Gatsby is a good example. All night saxophones will play this music among \\"golden slippers\\" of happiness, but inside there is only the depressing notes of the \\"wailing hopeless\\" BLUE. It presents happiness as a brief stop on the train of a depressing life. Then there is the \\"There is music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens.....\\"(P42) when Nick witnesses Gatsby's magnificent party. This \\"Blue Garden\\" is where Gatsby waits, and where sad music of the Blue flows with a million bottles of gay champions in a lonely and crowded symphony. There is grandeur, yet inside this grandeur are fighting husbands and wives, people talking who did not know each other, and drunker who attempts to drive a broken car.  The people are empty, they are searching for \\"fun\\", only because they are confused about life and their place in their life. The \\"blue garden\\" did not have blue grass, but had blue music, and a blue soul, and that blue soul belongs to all the people at the party, and the host himself.<br /><br />  The symbol of the valley of ashes is \\"The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg\\". They are \\"blue and gigantic--their retinas are one yard high.\\", and its \\"persistent stare\\" is always watching over. This stare by this brighter color over the lesser colors around it makes the pure blue eyes seem like a ruler. A ruler to which all the forgotten ashes and decays are hopelessly compared to, and the reality around is so corrupted and ugly that they even clouded the ruler itself. Words \\"pale\\"(P167) and \\"faded\\"(127) describe the blue eyes, which to a greater extend show this overcrowding of darker forces. The gray ash field is the reality of the world, and underneath the grand mansions of Gatsby and Tom is a thousand valley of ashes. They support the superficial happiness, but that happiness is to fall and to become a part of the gray burial mound at anytime. In fact, Gatsby becomes a part of the ashes even before he dies, he has nothing real, except a empty dream for Daisy. The blue here represents the only hope inside a hopeless world,  because it is the only color inside a colorless valley of ashes. It is clear that the blue here is different from the blue ocean and BLUE music. It is still about hope and despair, but of a different and higher sort.  Near the end of the book, Wilson repeats \\"God sees everything\\" as he looks at the blue eyes. It is questionable if Fitzgerald is calling people to turn away from the fate of been buried in the evil ashes and turn back to the promise of God. But it is clear that those blue eyes of a certain moral values are been ignored, and it is Fitzgerald's intention for people to pay more attention to this only color of promise.<br /><br />  Gatsby lives in the fancies of the blue music, sleeps in the dreams of the blue ocean, and is buried under the blue eyes of God. The use of the color blue shows not just the contradictions of Gatsby's life, but also that of his generation, the roaring 20th with all its laughs of the brighter blue and tears of the darker blue (as on the cover). The Great Gatsby is about hope, the collapse of hope, and more hope, and blue, with all its contradictory qualities, best mirrors this tragic story.always watching over.

US	51844093	RD0FSYS4B1VDH	0553346113	189578921	Sam Shepard : Seven Plays (Buried Child, Curse of the Starving Class, The Tooth of Crime, La Turista, Tongues, Savage Love, True West)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Essay, Different Ways of Life	11th grade English Essay <br />Phillips Academy, Andover <br /> <br />\\"True West\\" <br /> <br />    The play is about the struggle between modern society and more traditional ways of life. Lee and Austin represent two disconnected brothers with drastically different upbringings who have come to accept different norms. Against the growth of the city and the suburb, their spirit of the Wild West, though diminished, still exists. They steal and fight just like cowboys and highway robbers. Yet, both Lee and Austin are scared and frustrated. Lee doesn't know if he should try to blend into the new ways, and Austin doesn't know if he should go back to the old ways. And this play about two writers writing about the West is in itself a Western story. It has all the excitement and violence of a rider's life. <br /> <br />     Who else would steal a dozen toasters and TVs? Austin and Lee were lawless and wild, daring enough to do anything. Austin's car is like a horse, and driving out is like going for a raid. \\"Lee enters abruptly into kitchen carrying a stolen TV set.\\"  The sentence has such an air of ease as if Lee entered with a Shopping bag. Stealing is no more than a normal part of Lee's life. He lives off of it, like those high-way riders who plunder by-passers in the old days. The wholesale raid of the toasters shows the wilder side of Austin.\\" It was toasters you challenged me to. Only toasters. I ignored other temptation.\\"  He says to Lee after the thievery. These words make Austin sound like a warrior who has just beaten his rival in some major battle. The only irony is that the major battle was about stealing a dozen toasters. Austin is bragging about his lawlessness, and that is a very cowboy thing to do. Not only are these brothers such \\"professional\\" thief, they also are more than violent. From Lee \\"ax-chops(ing) at the typewriter using a nine-iron\\"  to Austin trying to choke his brother with a telephone cord while their mom is standing on the side. It is hard toget worse than that. It is like a misplaced scene from a Old Western movie. Not only do these pair of thief like to kill each other, they also have that independence and individualism that Western heroic images render so forcefully. On top of living on the desert by himself, Lee also says \\"I don't sleep.\\" , and does not seem to eat breakfast. \\"Do you Eat Breakfast?\\" \\"Look, don't worry about me pal. I can take care of myself.\\"  When Austin asks him if he needs any help with money, \\"Lee suddenly lungs at Austin, grabs him violently by the shirt and shakes him with tremendous power.\\"  Lee wants money, but he is going to get it by himself, not through his little brother. Lawless, violent, and independent, Lee and Austin are depicted in the play as the \\"True Western Heroes\\" borne at a wrong time. This, however, is only the first layer of the play. It makes the story entertaining, but not meaningful. <br /> <br />            \\"Yappin' their fool heads off. They don't yap like that on the desert. They howl. These are city coyotes here.\\"  The deeper meaning of the play is about the difference between the city \\"coyotes\\" and the country \\"coyotes\\". The country \\"coyote\\", Lee, is older, lives on a desert, use to catch snakes, and uneducated. The city \\"coyote\\", Austin, is younger, writes screen plays, does not remember having ever caught snakes, and has an Ivy League education. The brothers grew up together, but went onto totally different paths of life. But they don't merely represent two disgruntled brothers, but the struggle between the different ways of life. In Austin's eyes, the place where they used to live is \\"built up\\", but in Lee's eyes, the place has been \\"wiped out\\".   But the struggle is not that simple. At the same time of feeling deep nostalgia, and refusing to adapt to the new way with help from his brother, because \\"it is too cold up there.\\" , Lee also says the new houses that he saw were \\"like a paradise\\" with \\"Blonde people movin' in and outa' the rooms.\\"  Lee is deeply rooted in the old way of life and very unprepared socially and mentally for anything other than roaming around and stealing things. He likes comfort like anyone else, but the life of those living in those houses is like \\"paradise\\". They are far and aloft, and are not in his reach. Lee wants to write something to change his life, and Austin tells him that he can really turn things around and buy a ranch. Lee's excitement was obvious, \\" (laughs) A ranch? I could get a ranch?\\"  We can see that it is very clear that even when Lee tries to change, he is only trying to change back to the old ways. Austin at the end of the play suddenly made a deal with Lee asking his brother to bring him to the desert. This shows the conflict at the other end of spectrum. Austin has more money, and has a seemingly good life. But is he really happy? Is his frustration with life any less than Lee's? No. The society that he has so well adapted to is of little comfort to him. He tries for years to get a screenplay to production, but at the whim of an executive, the deal goes to his brother. Austin is frustrated, and though he types betters,  suffers as much. Lee asks Austin \\"maybe we're too intelligent..... One of us has even got a Ivy League Diploma. Now that means somethin' don't it?\\"  But no, it doesn't mean as much as it seems.  <br /> <br />      The truth is, the old West as it was disappeared long ago. It is no longer filled with rugged mountains, uncharted rivers, cowboy hats, and one does not have the freedom to roam around for thousands of miles with only wild animals as his companion anymore. The untamed natural world went away a hundred years ago with the railroads, and has been changing even more ever since. It is sad to see the past go by for those who grew up as a part of it. Faced with new situations, some of these people try to adapt, some have no chance to adapt, and some don't even want to adapt. And for those who have adapted, they wonder if the decision to changein the first place was valid after all. They wonder if they should go back. That poor Lee had no chance to adapt. He was left out by progresses, and envies dearly the seemingly much more comfortable life that others have. Austin at the same time is in the mainstream of modern life, but he is just as troubled and depressed by commercialism. However, within all these confusions and fightings, all these differences and changes, there is something that has always stayed the same, and that is the true spirit of the West, the \\"True West\\". The motivation for people to go to the West in the first place is also the motivation that made the world more modernized. The struggles that the first settlers of the West faced were no different from the struggles that people now face as they move into new ways of life. That spirit is not limited to time nor place, it is about the fundamental human eagerness for new and for more, and at the same time, the unquenchable ties to the past.	2004-11-23

In this conflict, Gregor, despite his bug body, showed a great sense of individuality, which was an essential part of humanity. When she tried to remove Gregor's furniture, Gregor' mother shook Gregor to a realization that his bug body had been taking away his humanness. Gregor was scared and shamed by this loss. In turn, he tried to preserve the social norm of humanity, and protect his furniture. In doing so, Gregor gained a selfishness that he had long lost because of his total absorption with serving the family. Although Gregor ended up having more individuality, he was further estranged from the society because of the conflict.<br /><br />  While moving Gregor's furniture in order to give him more room to crawl in, Gregor mother realized the importance of furniture as a part of Gregor's humanity. She thought that the removal would leave her son sad. The following text showed this:<br /><br />  \\"The sight of the naked walls made her own heart heavy, and why shouldn't Gregor have the same feeling, considering that he had been used to his furniture for so long and might feel forlorn without it. `And doesn't it look' she concluded in a low voice...... `doesn't it look as if we were showing him, by taking away his furniture, that we have given up hope of his ever getting better and are just leaving him coldly to himself?'\\"(102)<br /><br />  These words shook Gregor. He suddenly realized that he had forgotten parts of his humanity without himself knowing it. Normal people were supposed to feel \\"forlorn without\\" furniture that they loved. Yet, instead of feeling this, Gregor has \\"earnestly looked forward to having his room emptied of furnishing\\" (102). Gregor was not thinking like a person, but in like a bug. As the narrator said, \\"he had indeed been so near the brink of forgetfulness that only the voice of his mother, which he had not heard for so long, had drawn him back from it\\" (103).<br /><br />  In fact, Gregor's bug-like thinking could be traced to him physically becoming accustomed to and happy with the bug way of life and. The narrator described,<br /><br />  \\"...so that for mere recreation he had formed the habit of crawling crisscross over the walls and ceiling. He especially enjoyed hanging suspended from the ceiling; it was much better than lying on the floor; on could breathe more freely; one's body swung and rocked lightly; and in the almost blissful absorption induced by this supension it could happen to his own surprise that he let go and fell plump on the floor. Yet he now had his body much better under control than formerly, and even such a big fall did him no harm.\\" (100)<br /><br />  Hanging from the wall should not cause \\"blissful absorption\\" for humans. These were the results not of his body becoming much better controlled by Gregor, but instead of Gregor succumbing to the control of his body. Despite the new found individuality apparent in this, the social norm was for Gregor to feel ashamed about himself for acting like a bug, and he had to stop it.<br /><br />  His mother's words were therefore a turning point that awoke inside Gregor the shame for losing his humanity. Driven by this shame Gregor suddenly needed to conform to social norm, and he did it by holding onto his furnitures, something that his mother said were containers of memories.<br /><br />  Gregor felt shame before also, for example, he \\"felt so hot with shame and grief\\" (97) listening to his family talking about money issues. However, that was a different shame, which was more like guilt. Previously, \\"Gregor's sole desire was to do his utmost to help the family to forget as soon as possible the catastrophe which had overwhelmed the business and thrown them all in to a state of complete despair.\\" (95)  Gregor's change into a bug prevented him from serving the family, and he felt guilty because in his place, his asthma-prone mother, old father and young sister had to work for themselves.<br /><br />  Now, Gregor's shame has turned into a selfish shame. He was ashamed for losing his humanity and turning into a bug, because this shame was a social norm that man were suppose to have. Taken over by this urgent human desire to be human, Gregor forgot completely his duty to his family, and was ready to do anything to hold back those furnitures, which suddenly became the most important things to him. Here, Gregor's self interest turned against the family interest, and through this, he found his individuality which never really had when he served his family.<br /><br />  An example concerned Gregor's desk. Gregor wanted to keep it because he used the desk \\"when he was at the commercial academy, at the grammar school before that, yes even at the primary school\\" (104). This again showed that Gregor was ashamed and scared of losing his own memories, not memories with his family. Since his sister and mother were dissembling this \\"memory\\" desk which \\"had almost sunk into the floor\\" (104), Gregor's self-interest termed him against them.<br /><br />  Gregor's selfish attempt to hold back to his humanity reached a climax when \\"rushed out\\" (105) to protect his furniture against his sister and mother and made her mother faint. Without his previous decency to cover himself up under a blanket for the benefit of his family, Gregor clung in his giant naked bug form to a picture in his room to protect it from his mother and sister who were coming in to the room. Although Grete signaled him to move before their mother would notice him, Gregor \\"clung to his picture and would not give it up. He would rather fly in Grete's face.\\" (105) When his mother saw him, she fainted. Gregor's willingness to hurt his mother in order to hold on to his humanity represented a giant departure from his previous way of life.<br /><br />  Despite the apparent inhumanness in hurting one's mother, and despite his horrible bug appearance, Gregor displayed individuality here that had been previous suppressed by his family and his job. Before, \\"the boy thinks about nothing but his work\\" (75), yet Gregor did not like the work and felt \\"condemned to work\\". He only did it to feed his family. But although \\"the money was gratefully accepted and gladly given, but there was no special uprush and warm feeling.\\"<br /><br />  All these suppressed Gregor before, and took away his individuality, but his physical change into a bug loosened the impacts of these restraints on him. For example, Gregor's free roaming on the walls of his room, mentioned earlier, although inhuman, was the first sign of his freedom as an individual.<br /><br />  Having gained this individuality, Gregor wanted to obtain humanity also after he heard the warning from his mother. In another word, Gregor was human before and not an individual, when he became a bug, he slowly became an individual and was turning away from human. But now he wanted both. Sadly, he could not get both, because to be a human, he had to serve the family, not himself.<br /><br />  When Gregor realized what his selfishness had done, he returned to the old shame based on \\"consideration for his family\\", and was crashed by the conflict between his newly found individuality and his old subservience to the family. After her mother fainted, \\"Gregor wanted to helped too-there was still time to rescue the picture\\" (106). He was concerned for two things at once. Unable to do much, and unable to bear the familial-shame, Gregor \\"fell down on to the middle of the big table\\" (106) and collapsed until his father arrival.<br /><br />  The damage was already done, and as a result of his selfish-shame's adherence to the social norm of furniture, Gregor was at by the end of Part Two estranged from his family more than ever. Gregor's sister \\"banged the door shut with her foot\\" (106) from Gregor, his Mom \\"was perhaps nearly dying\\"(106), and his father attacked him with apples that left \\"incredible pain\\" (110) in his back, almost trying to kill him.<br /><br />  Shame drove Gregor to hold back to his own humanness and not let himself be a bug. He did this through holding onto his furnitures. In this process, Gregor showed an individuality that he sacrificed before for the well-being of his family before. At the end, Gregor was crushed and further estranged from this family, because he could not find a way to reconcile his individuality with a world that expected him to be subservient.ng one's mother, and despite his horrible bug appearance, Gregor displayed individuality here that had been previous suppressed by his family and his job.

US	51844093	RSYEWD64FGTXU	0452283868	921712930	Sula (Oprah's Book Club)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Essay, Sula witnessing the burning of hannah	Fan Wang, Core U of C class          <br /> <br />      In Chapter 1923 of Sula, Sula witnessed her mother, Hannah, getting burned to death. Strangely, Sula was not shocked, but only watched her mom die curiously. In this scene, Sula, with a great curiosity, was trying to establish her own way of life by challenging the passive life of Medallion, where black people endured economic inequality caused by racial prejudice. There were also other scenes of witnessing throughout the novel which made one question if Sula would ever succeed in her search for independence. <br /> <br />      Sula's strange act of witnessing was noticed by Eva. After the death of Hannah, Eva \\"remained convinced that Sula had watched Hannah burn not because she was paralyzed, but because she was interested.\\" (78) Sula confirmed Eva's view when she said on her deathbed, \\"I never meant anything. I stood there watching her burn and was thrilled. I wanted her to keep on jerking like that, to keep on dancing.'\\" (147) <br /> <br />        The reasons for what she did were complicated, but it was an extension of her desire to go \\"down like one of those redwoods\\" instead of \\"dying like stumps\\" (143) as the others in Medallion were doing. In Sula's view, people were \\"dying like stumps\\" because they were passive toward racial prejudice and the lack of economic opportunities. Sula wanted instead to succumb to no one and beat out a path by herself and for herself alone. This was apparent from her friendship with Nel, <br /> <br />         \\"So when they met, first in those chocolate halls and next through the ropes of the swing, they felt the ease and comfort of old friends. Because each had discovered years before that they were neither white nor male, and that all freedom and triumph was forbidden to them, they had set about creating something else to be.\\" (52) <br /> <br />         It was not apparent from the outside of the peaceful Bottom that \\"freedom and triumph was forbidden to\\" its people, but behind the veils of laughters, the citizens of the Bottom shared an \\"adult pain that rested somewhere under the eyelids, somewhere under their head rags and soft hats\\" (4). They suffered because white people have cheated them into the hilly land, where \\"planting was backbreaking, where the soil slid down and washed away the seeds, and where the wind lingered all through the winter.\\" (5) The white people also deprived them opportunities to work, leaving men like Ajax and Jude with \\"craving to do the white man's work.\\" (128)  <br /> <br />         However, instead of fighting against prejudices, the people of Medallion reacted passively. Against the white man's insult on the train, Helene \\"smiled dazzlingly and coquettishly at the salmon-colored face of the conductor\\". (21) And after telling a story that ended with \\"negro man had a hard row to hoe in this world\\" (103), Jude only expected \\"milkwarm commiseration\\" (103) from his wife and Sula. The people of the bottom saw their sufferings as a part of their fate. They let the evils of their world \\"run its full course, fulfill itself, and never invented ways either to alter it, to annihilate it or to prevent its happening again.\\" (89) To them, \\"the purpose of evil was to survive it\\" (90). But this survival was illusionary. Just as Eva would never forget the cold winter of \\"18 and 95\\" (69), the people of the Bottom would always \\"feel the oldest and most devastating pain there is: not the pain of childhood, but the remembrance of it.\\" (65) <br /> <br />        Sula did not want a life like that. She said, \\"I don't want to make somebody else. I want to make myself.\\" (92) And the freedom she had growing up in a family where the mother \\"never scolded or gave directions\\" (29) taught her how to be different.  <br /> <br />        Sula first asserted herself when she challenged the Irish boys whose \\"place in this world was secured only when they echoed the old residents' attitude toward blacks.\\"(53) With Nel, Sula challenged them by cutting her finger; she did it so that Nel and her could gain the right to \\"go on home the shortest way.\\" (54) From this point on, \\"adventuresomeness\\" (55) became Sula's defining quality.  <br /> <br />         It was precisely because of the abandonment of the old that allowed Sula to stand there and watch her mother burn. To the people of the bottom, death was a time when they came together to pity themselves in their common sufferings. At the funeral for \\"Chicken Little\\", people of Medallion \\"heard the one word, or phrase, or inflection that was for them the connection between the event and themselves...And they saw the Lamb's eye and the truly innocent victim: themselves.\\" (65) Sula did not want any part of this passive commiseration. She did not one to be one of those people \\"who gathered `round would shake their heads at the recollection\\" of the death of Hannah (76).  She wanted to feel herself only, and avoided touching the pain of others which ran in endless cycles of communal remorse. <br /> <br />        Sula also strangely thought that the burning was \\"thrilling\\". She was thrilled not because of any hatred against her mother; Sula \\"didn't mean anything\\" (147). The \\"dance\\" and \\"jerking\\" thrilled her simply because they were new and interesting, and that satisfied her \\"adventuresomeness\\". As Sula sung, \\"I have sung all the songs there are\\" (137), it was apparent that with a grand inclusiveness, Sula simply wanted to experience everything so that she could find something in it for her new life, and that something included even to see her mother \\"jerking like that, to keep on dancing\\". <br /> <br />        Still, there is something strange in this lack of concern of Sula for her mother, which corresponded to a general lack of familial ties throughout the Bottom as described in the book. This void was tied to the hard economic pains suffered by the people of Medallion. When one could not even feed herself and her young, there could be little time for tenderemotions as we know it. Eva made this clear in her reply to Hannah's question if she had loved and played with them, she said, \\"No time. They wasn't no time. Not none. Soon as I got one day done here come a night.\\" (69) Although Hannah was not as deprived as Eva, her husband Rekus \\"died when their daughter Sula was about three years old\\". (41) Even today, families of single mother the sources of many social ills; it could only have been worse in the 1920th for the black women living in a poor town.  <br /> <br />        Sula was challenging the status quo. If black people could stand up like \\"redwoods\\" as she did, then the relationships in families would have been different. But such as it was, Sula was a product of the status quo, and she should be pitied for having not the \\"time\\" to learn about the familial feelings that most people today share.  <br /> <br />        Just like this scene just described, the book Sula frequently struck readers with unexpected events involving Sula in scenes such as the death of \\"Chicken Little\\", the cutting of Sula's finger, or the sex scene between Sula and Jude. There was a witness in every one of the scenes, and no preparations were made for the unexpected turns. For example, the readers first learnt that Jude thought Sula \\"stirred a man's mind maybe, but not his body\\" (104), however, without any indication of change, Nel was witnessing Jude and Sula \\"down on all fours naked\\" (105) right afterwards. <br /> <br />           These unexpected events call into question the meaning of \\"fate\\". Chicken Little, Nel, Hannah whether witness or been witnessed all suffered from acts that no one seemed to have had mastery over. Once the event happened, there was nothing they could do but live through or die with the events' consequences. However, it was precisely the mastery over the \\"fate\\" of life that Sula was after. If nothing could be predicted, and Sula herself was a part of that unexpectedness, her search for self-identity was destinedto fail.     <br /> <br />         Indeed, in the latter parts of the book, Sula seemed to experience a change of heart away from her search for curiosities as she faltered in her search for independence, nevertheless, the details for that are materials for a different essay. Even considering that, Sula still committed most of her life to \\"walking around all independent-like\\" (142). Sula saw the quiet sufferings \\"under the eyelids\\" of the people of Medallion, and she knew that if she did not do something different, fate would have had her suffer the same. Sula wanted to be free, and one of her first acts of freewill was, sadly enough, watching her mother burn to death.	2004-11-23

Since last month, I have taken the challenge to memorize them all. Everyday, I also took one of the 30 or so question sets (10 analogy, 10 fill-in, 10 reading). By now, I am 2/3 of the way finished. This contributed greatly to the increase of my verbal score to 750 (from 650) on the practice SAT test. <br />Besides, I also have &quot;hot words for SAT 1&quot;, and the Barron's guide. This is because one book does not offer enough practices. Getting a couple books is also advantagous because the varying teaching styles makes the task of memorization less monotonous.	2003-07-25

He used plain language without boasting of himself told one of the greatest business story ever. &quot;Oh, how come it was all so easy? He did nothing by himself!&quot; and so on are questions that might pop up after reading the book. Just remember, everybody knows eating less and workout more will reduce fat, but look at how many people are fat. Jack has the power of execution! He envisioned something, and could achieve it. He was not the smartest, but he was the toughest; it's personality not intelligence that counts. It's hard to see these things from this book, because it's an autobiography, and it's not likely for one person to analyze himself so completely with the conclusion been that he is better than all others. Anyway, dwell into the book a bit more; you will learn and admire.	2001-11-30

I am amazed that this book is so low on the bestselling list (300,000). This was such a brief (200 pages) and informative book on the main trends of American secondary education in this past centure. The best thing is, the book did not just discuss the major national events, and the ever-varying goals of education, but also used actual data from reasearches done in different times on different cities to evaluate the what really happened in students course taking patterns and course offering after and amid the chaos of all the national debates. I bought the book because I was working on a Education Reform plan, and needed to know more about secondary schools' historic developments. Reading this book has achieved this goal for me, and I would suggest you to read the book if you want to know history told inpartially. It has the real national and regional Data! The book's conclusion about this past century is that differentiation in curriculum is undemocratic, and has been the source of American Secondary education's problem. That's why the title is &quot;the failed promise&quot;. Bad Side: It was written in 1995, kind of out-of-date. I think it did not recognize the benifits of differentiated curriculum. The system was indeed unequal, but was not completely. It was better than the total focus on College-prep before the 10s, and at least did not force everybody to study useless knowledges when most people didn't have to go to colleges.	2001-08-30

I freely admit that there are countless other paths through chemical history, and I apologize in advance for discoveries omitted or given short shrift. However, I want this book to be useful and to fulfill this mission it approach will not help to achieve this goal. Although I have attempted to apologize for the weak coverage given to early science in Chinese, Indian, African, Moslem, and other cultures. This is really more an artifact of the availability of printed books rather than intent. <br />   &quot;Although our tour is meant to be both light-hearted and light reading it tackles some of the important issues that are often too lightly or confusingly broached in introductory courses and are difficult to teach. We do, however, try out hand at humor and some of the earthiness so evident in the Renaissance works of Chauvcer and Rabeliais. Why not include Van helmont's recipe for punishment of anonymous &quot;slovens&quot; who leave excrement at one's doorstep? By providing such vignettes, I hope to reengage chemists and other scientists in the history of our field, its manner of expressing and illustrating itself and its engagement with the wider culture. I hope to provide teachers in introductory chemistry courses with some guidance through difficult teaching areas and a few anecdotes to lighten the occasional slow lecture. And if a few students are caught snickering over a page of Rabelaisian chemical lore or some bad puns, would that be such a bad thing?&quot;<br />   The author also suggested further readings in his acknowledgments:<br />     &quot;The most authoritative is the inspirational four volume reference work, A History of Chemistry (McMillan, 1961-1964), by john R. Partington.&quot; <br />     &quot;The development of Modern Chemistry (Harper &amp; Row, 1964), and the more recent book by William H.brock, the Norton Hisotry of Chemistry (Norton, 1993).&quot;	2001-07-24

Mr. UCLA (the reviewer who gave the book 1 star) was probably a student of the writer, who is a teacher in UCLA. He didn't seem to enjoy his class too much. <br />Anyway, I bought the book because I was working on my so-called &quot;education reform&quot;, but realized that I didn't know anything about education. The book helped out a lot. It writes about the full history of American Higher education with an emphasis on later eras. Colonial, Emergent nattion, university transformation, mass higher education, and contemporary are the five stage of Higher Education's development. He wrote about the major trends and characteristics of each era, some trends lasting for several eras, like the continuous expansion of the system, never ending diversification, and constant cries for access. One chapter is for one era, and all chapters are subdivided into eight sections to fully illustrate the details of each generation: societal context, institutions, students, faculty, curriculum and instruction, governance and administration, finance, and research and outcomes. The book is very well researched, and has a tremendous amount of data and charts, which were put together very nicely by the author. But that does not mean the book is boring! Though for most of the parts the author tried to be impartial, there were still many spalkling moments when you could feel the author's passion beaming out from the pages, especially as the book go into more modern eras. I know so much more about the history of US education now, and this whole process of developments is very amazing. With this understanding of history, I also gained a far better good grip on current issues, issues not only relating to higher education, but education as a whole. Don't hesitate, you will learn much!	2001-06-30

I have never taken a photography class, therefore, had little basic knowledges about photography. I bought this book because my biggest problem was &quot;what is the right exposure?&quot;. After several weeks of fascinating reading, my pictures have totally improved, they now have a consistency in quality, that professional look I have always dreamt of. I have read other photography books before, but most of them try to tell you everything, therefore have no focus, and only make you more confused; In contrast, this book only tries to teach you the basic in a very easy to understand and progressive structure. First you learn about exposure, then aperture, then shutter speed, and film speed and special effects at the end. Most of my old problems were resolved, how to take pictures in snow, how to make super long(hour long) exposures, how to make everything crisp clear..... I urge any amatures who have been taking pictures for a while, but have not yet gained a strong grip on this subject to read this book. Only one reminder: no matter how good a book is, if you don't practice hard, you still can't take good pictures.<br />Problems: This book was written 10 years ago, a lot have changed since; The author tried to make everything really clear, so there are some excessive explanations and repetition.  ...	2001-05-25

This book is centered around the personal and social problems that are emerging with the New Economy, but as the author reasoned on, the book expended into many other areas of the economy and social life too. Robert explained in very simple terms many conflicts and social schemes that are troubling families and communities, he analysid thoroghly the causes and predicted the futures influences of these conflicts. Most of these problems we face daily, but never fully understood, or even realized. It address real-life problems, explain them, relate them together in a grander social scale, and always at the end of each chapter correlate it back to his main topic. It was a very clear reading that everybody can understand, and his many personal stories and national stastics makes the writing convincing. <br />    I bought the book on Amazon's suggestions, and am very happy with it. I was very surprised by the book, for I thought it would be a book of solutions for problems, but it turned out to be a book of history, of causes of these problems. But that was not a disappointment as I was impressed by each chapter as I went on. His theories are not completely new, but the way he named these theories and explained them is refreshing. I learned a huge amount of unexpected knowledges, and believe you would be impressed by the book too. Robert B. Reichs has done a good job. <br />The Bad Things: It's an excellent book, but is not likely to change anything much, for solutions aren't the focus, I guess you can say it has a big head, but a small tail. And he repeats stuff sometimes, though mostly for the purpose for a clear understanding.	2001-04-22

I liked the way time swiches, you constantly change from one high point to another. At first, I wasn't so used to it, but as the book progressed, I loved the time travel more and more. Our teacher told us this was a very significant book in the 60th, it was a book for the hippy generation. We discussed the anti-war, free love, and acceptance aspects of the book, but because there wasn't anything that's really hard to understand, not much things were discussed. It was a Spring Break reading, and all my classmates who actually read the book had a lot of fun with it. (When your teacher askes you to read something, you better read it!) I was expecting more war scenes, but the book didn't have much.

This book is half of a book as Scott explains at the end of the book, I was some what disappointed by that. Another sad thing is that he spend too much time on too little things, making you feel a urgent need to finish the book sometimes. That's why I took one star away.<br />  Yet, I admire the book greatly, it teaches you a lot about how to manage people, and also has great suspense for most of the time. It has that special Scotty taste to it--the way characters think make you feel you are them and they are you, not like some other SFs that totally run off the ground; the intelligence, the philosophical depth to it that make you think constantly; and the drop from sudden high to low at the end that makes the book both loud and quiet; the solving of all the puzzels; also the kids power. <br />  Overall, it is great, but the world scemes that Scott set up is more like kids playing than reality, and makes the book a kind of stupid.	2001-03-27

This is more than just a recording on the Tiananmen Turmoil, but a chronicle from which useful reflections can always be drawn, especially now. If the Chinese Government, can be brave as to accept this book, repents its ill-doing of the past, and embrace more political openness and changes in the future, we, 1.3 billion brothers and sisters, will be the happiest people on earth. <br />The more I read, the more I understand, and the more I pity our leaders, for their situations were so critical, futures so uncertain, and with all those uncertainties, had to decide nevertheless the directions of a whole country.

It was an amazing trip through the globe I have taken in several day. But the book has an ending that's leaving too many questions unanswered, which I would rather it have given me much more explainations. And the book seems to be too plain, old, because it was written such a long time ago, and the author had no intention of making the lines exciting in a way we accept today, and which is also a result of too many unrelated stories been piled together without a common base, basically, the book has pretty much no plot. That's a reason you might consider not buying the book.<br />But I liked the book a lot, I can not understand how can the author write one story after another that just get more and more surprising, and the way he brings out each story.

This book vividly describs how people's understanding about ourselves, about our history and our natural environment changed and changed again and again as new instruments become available, more knowleges were collected and more resources were poured into the study of the science of life.  This book is well written, a pleasure read in my standard.  It give me a much better understanding of myself.  Just so you know, this book is one in a series.<br />  Physical Science in middle age.  The construction of modern science: Mechanism and Mechanics  and one other book that is out of print.  For people want to know more about how biology used to be and how many hard works have been done for its study, it is a really good book to buy.	2000-10-01

US	51844093	R19LG64LGFSGIL	1859848982	201213691	The Communist Manifesto: A Modern Edition	Books	4	1	11	N	N	Forgot to say.	I forgot to say about this book's positive effects in history. It did not change the world that it was suppose to change at all, which are the countries that were already industrilized like England, France and America,  but it changed the counties like Russia and China where there were almost  no workers, no captalists and no industries back than, but only had the  really really bad old feudal governments with tons of poor farmers. So what  communism or this book really did was that it helped to transform the  countries that were very undeveloped, very poor into counties with  industries, with enough food for the people, and even a better governmenr!  This really doesn't sound like making too much senses at all, but you have  got to learn how bad things were 70 years ago in China and Russia, how  impossible it was for there to be a democratic government, and how much  improvment it was to the people to have communist government instead of all  the other governemts that they had before. Look at China and Russia, they  are very poor even now compare with the U.S., but do you realize how much  they have improved?  They have been going up ten times as fast as the U.S..  They are still worse than the U.S. does not give you the right to say  communism is bad! (I am come from China)	2000-06-08
US	51844093	R2DLB1NL6CEJVD	1859848982	201213691	The Communist Manifesto: A Modern Edition	Books	4	2	10	N	N	Great book, but I disagree with it.	Very well written, full of emotion, no wander why so many people feared this book so much in the past, it is so powerful. &quot;The workers have nothing to loss but their chains!&quot; I believe if I was a worker who was  suffering so much back than, I would be a deep believer in Marx  too!----------------It talked about thefundamental conflicts between  different classes of people, and the problem is caused by private property,  so without private property, everybody can be happy as oppose to some  people very rich some very poor. And the deffinition for communism is  &quot;destory all private properties.------------------I disagree with this  book because, first, The poor conditions of the workers are not caused by  the people who own the means of production but caused by the limited amount  of products we have. We were not advanced enough that we could efford to  give everybody enough! But the workers did not care, all they saw was that  their bosses could live well but they could not, so of course they wanted  to revolt. There is no way you can be reational when you do not even have  enough to eat. Second, the only way to solve this problem is to make more  products and improve efficency, and the compitetion caused by the will to  earn more money by the people who have the means of production causd that.  Anyway, this was a great book.	2000-06-07

There is always a way to solve problems, come down, and think a way out!------------Don't ever believe that you really understand  anybody, not even the one who you think you know the most. Because there is  always something about himthat he is hiding away from you. People always  misunderstand each other because of this, the infomations that you  collected are not complete, so of course your conclusion is not completely  right either! Just beware of that!-----------------There is always someone  behide a hero who made him the hero, you never know  everything!--------------Those are the things that I have learned from  Ender's shadow, it is a book full of personal feelings, touching. But you  should read Ender's Game before you read this, if not, the book has little  meaning! Card is great!	2000-06-06

It is very radical. Proof first, American helped a lot of atrocities happened in many countries, they attacked Kosovo because Kosovo is politically against U.S.,  not for humanism reasons. Because if they helped Kosovo for humanism  reasons, they would have helped other conuntries too. Proof two, the U.S.  made the situations in Kosovo worse. Before the bombing, U.S. knew that  there will be more ethnic cleanse if U.S. bombed Kosovo, but they did it  anyway. Most of the cleanse happened after the bomb, not before it! So the  bombing did not save the people from been killed, but killed more people  and destroyed the whole economy of that country. ----------------- But I  did not agree with this book, I think what the U.S. did was right. Bombing  killed people, but that was the best thing we could have done. We punished  the dictatorship of a evil government, by doing that we also warned every  other countries in the world that no one will get away with ethnic cleanse!  And also, I believe the intention of The U.S. government and the support of  U.S. people in this war are justice. Cliton did not send U.S Air Force to  Kosovo because he wanted to kill more people, but to save people. The war  was right.	2000-05-26
US	51844093	RSIDFVL0LMOXZ	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Very good, but lack of human feeling.	After finished reading this book, I really started to love water, started to notice how beatiful, how powerful, how useful those little drops can be. I used to fear get in to cold water and swim, but now, I love to swim in  cold water, feel the coldness. This book is a book about a boy's legendary  history. His father was a Duck, but their enemy killed his father, and he  was been chased by that enemy. He hided in the desert with his mother,  lived with the people on the desert, and he became the leader of those  desert people who are really brave but were lack of technologies. Then, he  had a huge fight with the enemy that killed his father and won. It has  amazing plot. But something that this book lacks is the feeling of people,  I have just read Ender's game before Dune, and you just don't feel that you  are a part of the story in this book as you are in Ender's Game. I have  learned a lot from this book too--Do not fear, come down and think of a way  out, be confident of yourself, and also do not be too arrogant think your  own idea as the always true thought. This is a good book, you should read  it!	2000-05-15

I bought this book, because I had to write a report on prostitution for my history class. This book is amazing. It tells you how prostitution became a huge industry, and how it waned in the turn of the century. It's pure history, full of data. I can not believe prostitution was so pervasive and  so normal that 1 out of 6 or 7 woman in New York City were prostitutes. It  also tells you about why people chose to be prostitute. One interesting  thing in this book is that you can see that prostitution is just like any  other industries--because it's so hugely profitable, everybody was trying  to think of a new way of attarcting male patrons to earn money, and every  time when people try to eliminate prostitution, it always adapts itself so  that it can survive. The men culture which was a Coo-product of prostition  was Sporting-men culture, those young boys did not care about any  traditions, they had their new way of doing things. And also the  relationship between prostitution and real estate industry. But at the end,  because prostitution is so pervasive, causing so much trobles, and there  were so many people angaist it, so it waned. But the main reason that  happened was because the supply and demand for prostitution deceased, and  because of the rise of industry, prostitution was not the most profitable  business anymore.  Strongly Recommended. Oh, yeah, this book has 500 pages,  but 200 of them are appendix, so it's only a 300 pages book. Also, this  book sometimes has too much details.	2000-05-10

US	51844093	R24XYQ6CTXCSBH	0812509250	4976316	Xenocide: Volume Three of the Ender Quintet	Books	4	2	4	N	N	It's not only a S/F!	Xenocide does have a very good plot, but not as good as the one Ender's game had. It's more about life, about people, about love!       One thing bad about this book is that it's way too long! I mean that Card could have  cut the book in half, and people would like it better. It has too much  philosophical conversations that are not necessary. So don't be surpised if  you find this book boring sometimes.     But the book definitely has a good  ending, very good. Everything came as surprise. What to believe and what  not to, what is the truth and what is not. Love what you love, be what you  are. Live as happy as you wish. Life is beautiful.     Overall, it's a book  that's worth to read. But if you are really busy and don't have a lot of  reading time for S/F, I don't think you should buy this book, there are a  lot of better books out there. ( If you have read Ender's Game, skip this  and The speaker of the dead, go read Ender's shadow)	2000-04-29

We should spend time on doing something productive when we are young, and read those life thinkings when we are old enough to. So, I don't think that we should force all students to read this book, it should only be an  option.<br />But, it still a good book.	2000-03-28
US	51844093	RYXIIOR71UCMA	0395893275	229916835	Sony: The Private Life	Books	4	3	6	N	N	Good book	I like the first half of the book alot, it tells you how did two postwas Japenese engineers established one of the best known company in the world. The way that Ibuka uesd to motivated his people with his brave new idea  resulted the invention of Walkman, CD player, and tritron, and they bravely  moved into the American market. However, as Sony became a huge company, it  somewhat lost something. thier executives liked money more than to make  sony a place for engineers, and because of that, the second half of the  book became very very boring, however, it tells you how much internal  trobles a company can have after they got big. <br />BUt it's a good book.	2000-01-30

But I really learned a lot from this book. There are a lot of interesting datas in this book: for example, the life expectancy of an American Black  is even lower then Chinese even though Chinese earn much less money than  them; And in the civil war, Black slaves actually earn more money then  Federal's workers, but because they had no freedom, so they still like  Federals better, even though they are not going to earn as much money  there. The relationship between the freedom that people enjoy and the  amount of money they are are not Direct Variation, In another word, Money  doesn't equal to freedom.<br />I suggest you to buy this book, but you don't  have to read the whole thing, the first three or four chapters are the core  value of this book	1999-12-11
