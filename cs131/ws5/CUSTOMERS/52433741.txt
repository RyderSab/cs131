I am sure the rest of the story would have been great, but I could not get through the beginning for the story began to just tell a different past than what happened before.  Such as Dylan was the one to bring the girls from Missouri when actually in Glory it was Jackson.  Again it mixed Glory story with Ruth when Patience refer to Ruth shooting an elk and covering her and Dylan with it.  It is as if neither Glory's or Ruth's story was told.  They blended the two.  After that I just was not into the book. The book lost it's appeal. I returned it to store for my money back I may read it sometime in the future but not right now.	2004-02-19

My question would be why play with fire.  He is right.  It is better to be extreme in the way one approaches a relationship and know that they are in NO DOUBT being righteous before God.  Not with I think that I am right so therefor I am right but looking in the Bible they find that they are wrong (Proverbs 14:12).  I suggest reading the book all the way through and not just stopping because one don't agree with something.  I plan to use what Joshua suggests along with many more radical things I learned through the Bible.  Good luck I know that in the end one will have a better relationship.
