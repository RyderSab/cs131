October 7, 2005 <br /> <br />Encyclopedia Brown meets Napoleon Dynamite... <br /> <br />Francis Jones is a not so typical high school student.  He has a small circle of friends, is always looking for acceptance and has just assigned himself the task of locating a missing person - who happens to be his best friend and football hero, Ted.  Ted disappeared without a trace and the adults in the community have remained very evasive when asked about his whereabouts.  The adults' odd behavior and Firecracker Jones' overactive imagination formulate several conspiracy theories that just don't pan out. <br /> <br />I liken Firecracker or \\"F\\" - as his friends call him - to two figures from two different generations.  Encyclopedia Brown;  for his uncanny investigative skills and unique techniques and Napoleon Dynamite for his awkwardness that does not sway him from accomplishing the things that he puts his mind to.  With this formula, you have a likeable character, with a very active imagination and the ability to surprise you every time. We have access to his thoughts and his perception of himself and how he fits into various situations. <br /> <br />As Firecracker and his friend Oliver Chubinski (a.k.a. Chub) set off to find Ted, the laughs continue as this odd-couple finds themselves in one mishap after another. One afternoon, there's a break in the case and Firecracker uses his detective skills to locate Ted.  F, Chub and Chub's large bag of food make there way across town and what they find will change them forever. <br /> <br />Firecracker Jones Is on the Case is written in a style reminiscent of Judy Blume; where you get inside the character's head and start to have fun walking in their shoes for a few miles.  You live in his inner thoughts and experience his distractions and words from his imagination.  This was one of the best books that I've read lately and I will look for the sequel!! <br /> <br />Tyrone V. Banks  <br />	2005-10-11

It is in no way an answer to all problems, but if we heed the advice that is given, we can prevent many unfortunate events that affect our lives and our wallets. <br /> <br />The Author James McGrew has been a law enforcement officer and is the president and CEO of an investigative and security consulting firm located in San Jose.

His mission is to save his son Gordon from a cruel fate at the hands of the evil \\"Dark Prince\\" of Hellunder. <br /> <br />The story begins ironically as Jack dies in a tragic automobile accident.  His guardian angel, Benjamin, laments the loss of his charge but is advised of the mission that he and Jack are to undertake.  As this \\"odd-couple\\" transitions towards the battle with the Dark Prince, the adventures that they share will leave you gasping for breath, laughing - or crying.  Benjamin is given a companion in Jack that allows him to recount hundreds of years of his work as a guardian angel. <br /> <br />Without giving away too much of the story, I will say this; the battle scene between Jack and Satan in the form of the High Prince is amazing.  You separate the physical differences these two life forms exist in and you can see the inner workings of a higher struggle. Even as Jack was being pummeled by the Dark Prince and seconds away from defeat - he calls on the \\"Great Prince of Heavenland\\" for strength and guidance.  At that very moment, the battlefield began to shift in the favor of righteousness.  But believe me, there is so much more to this amazing battle scene and so many more vivid images that come to life and cause you to react as if you are there. <br /> <br />You can sense the essence of the internal struggle that we face every day personified by the two combatants engaged in a never-ending war.  The Dark Prince utilizes your own fears first and foremost and works towards your inner fears, doubts and misgivings.  At one point, as the Great Prince shielded Jack from what would have been a death blow, the Dark Prince again went after Gordon - he used Jack's compassion as a powerful weapon - and ended up face first in a pile of trash for his efforts. <br /> <br />There are so many more stories to tell and memories to share with in regards to this rich and powerful book which has been forged by faith.  these stories will cause you the reflect on your own day to day struggles to do what is right and defeat what is wrong. J.D. Howes has weaved a remarkable tale that can be enjoyed by young readers, who will learn a valuable lesson in this entertaining story.  Forever: A Godyssey Adventure will also be enjoyed by those who understand the spiritual message already but just want to be entertained by a fulfilling story told in a unique way that will make you \\"Pray\\" for a sequel. <br /> <br />Tyrone V.

Benedict Arnold is portrayed as a fearless hero who is instrumental in the success of the American forces in spite of some of the challenges that they faced.  Injured during a campaign, he is seen as a hero who has gained the respect of General George Washington himself.  <br />As he faces a long recovery from his wounds, which injure his spirit more so than his body, through this play you can see that he begins to envy the British and he desires the things that someone of his social status would normally be denied.  Sensing this weakness and utilizing her feminine charm, a Tory spy named Peggy Shippen is convinced by a British agent named John Andr to coerce Arnold into betraying his country. <br />Arnold feels as if he is backed into a corner as he does not want to return to his employ as a local pharmacist and bookseller.  As he tries to decide what he can do to retain a high status, Peggy - under the influence of Andre, suggests that he sells secrets to the British for a high price.  He is torn between his loyalties to the country and to General Washington, but as he negotiates a large fee (10,000 pounds) for turning over West Point to the British, his loyalties are quickly forgotten. <br />Although he was assigned another high military post by Washington, he protests and calls himself lame until Washington aggress that he is to be given command of West Point. He sets up a favorable scenario for a successful British Invasion and gives John Andr detailed plans of West Point.  Andre' is captured with the plans and all fingers point to Arnold as the one who gave him the information.  Hence - the plan is foiled as Andr is executed and Arnold escapes to England where he is generally despised. <br />I've read Zubrin's \\"The Holy Land\\";  this book, although more historical non-fiction as opposed to Science Fiction, highlights his versatility and fact-finding abilities.   <br />Benedict Arnold: A Drama of the American Revolution in Five Acts was a joy to read and it makes an otherwise mundane topic very entertaining and enlightening.  Although a short read, because it is actually a play, it was one book that will give my library some diversity and substance that I will enjoy for years to come. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Reviewed by; Tyrone V.

Words Of Wisdom To Help You Live And Grow. <br /> <br />\\"Therefore I Am: A Book for African-American Men\\" is definitely a book that should be read by today's African American men.  It is a unification of a common thought process assembled from the gems of knowledge offered by a variety of men of color.  Each of them come from different backgrounds and age groups, but the words they offer seem to merge with one another and become priceless advice. <br /> <br />I had the benefit of a father who constantly taught me life lessons at each and every given opportunity.  Under his counsel, I have values, morals and beliefs that I now pass on to my children in my own way.  The value of Covington's book exists in various forms.  Individually you can decide to heed or ignore the information that is presented.  However, if you are an African American Male or a male/female of any cultural/socioeconomic group, you can benefit from this collection of wisdom.  If you are looking for direction, guidance or even affirmation of your current positive values - you will find it in this book.  If you are without a positive male role-model in your life you are in luck because you will find them here as well. <br /> <br />\\"Therefore I Am: A Book for African-American Men\\" is similar to James Allen's \\"As a Man Thinketh\\" in that it strives to teach and empower individuals to better themselves from within.  The major difference however is the fact that Covington's work is straight forward and devoid of flowery words and symbolism.  It is true knowledge passed down from positive role models and community activists.  The men in this book practice what they preach as they carry out the occupations that they have obtained or in their deeds and actions. <br /> <br />These words taken directly from the book sum up the spirit of this piece of nonfiction: <br />\\"Not all men worthy of listening to or learning from are deceased or are those few that are only mentioned during Black History Month.\\"  I applaud Mr. Covington and thank him for collecting this information to share with and motivate others to become better.  Read \\"Therefore I Am: A Book for African-American Men\\" and keep it close by.  It is a priceless \\"user-guide\\" to the human experience. <br /> <br />Tyrone V. Banks  <br />	2005-08-07

Within the pages I view the life of the main character who recollects various memories that one will find difficult to discern from reality.  There are several dream sequences that give the main character, named Jack, several clues about his existence and the collective memories that hone all men and women alike.   <br /> <br />You travel towards a higher level of understanding and you are enraptured within the images.  Within this one book you are privy to various stories that make very interesting reading.  The stories are told with a blatant honesty as you cannot help but to see and feel what the author has seen and felt during his lifetime.  As I said earlier it is hard to tell if this is fiction or nonfiction as the events that unfold, however surreal, can happen to any of us physically and/or mentally.   <br /> <br />A similar trait shared with Daley's previous book, \\"Tasting the White Water\\", is that we journey with him as he embarks on a journey that may never end.  There are so many aspects of our lives that we lose touch with.  If we are lucky, we can reclaim this awareness before we pass on.  His book will teach you small snippets about the teachings of Krishnmurti, who believes that the problems faced by man can be resolved in part by understanding the images that fill our conscious and trying to understand and then overcome these self imposed situations.  Please don't quote me on that last statement , but just know that within the pages of Daley's books you are taking a journey riddled with various images and thoughts that themselves lead to the answers to complex questions. <br /> <br />Read \\"Sunday Mornings\\" and then take whatever path your heart tells you to take.  Along the way, this book will definitely keep you company and assure you that you are not in this - the whole collective of problems versus solutions - alone. <br /> <br />Tyrone V.

Entertaining and unpredictable from start to finish! <br /> <br />Taylor Hayes sees himself as a modern day warrior.  He and his \\"associates\\" carry out a stream of seemingly pointless murders as they elude the local authorities and one discouraged Detective named Jennings.  In the beginning of the book in the characters' earlier stages of development, the crimes committed will shock the reader.  You will see Taylor as a serial killer who is guided by a Native American Elder.  He believes that he has a sacred mission to accomplish.  First and foremost he believes that he is seeking revenge for the death of his adoptive parents who he suspects were killed by a local banker named Kyle Gayland.  We find out later that his mission has many facets and this creates an environment of \\"organized confusion\\" that will only make sense in the end. <br /> <br />Gayland is Taylor's \\"nemesis\\" and is more or less a money driven businessman who will do anything to \\"turn a profit.\\" His master plan is one that we find in several pieces of fiction and non-fiction.  He wants to build on underdeveloped land and only one thing stands in his way - the people who live there.  He will resort to any tactic to remove them from this land.  He sends in an exterminator to spray the area to remove unwanted pests.  The people are unaware of the fact that they are indeed the \\"pests\\" that Gayland would like to exterminate.  They are exposed to a poison designed to sicken and/or kill off the men, women and children who want only to live in peace.  These tactics are similar to the use of bison skin blankets smeared with smallpox in 1763 to rid the land of the Natives.  The Natives received this gift only to succumb to the disease later. <br /> <br />At this point, the reader may actually start to understand Taylor's cause and the reopening of racial wounds that many would like to forget.  He feels that his acts of violence pale in comparison to the \\"White Man's\\" acquisition of Native American territoryfor many centuries. Although his adoptive parents were Native American and he is not! <br /> <br />A fine line develops between vengeance and murder as Taylor begins to see his mission as a psychology experiment as well.  He moves forward for all of the wrong reasons and his noble quest becomes nothing more than an unjustified bloodbath.  However, Taylor does not see it that way and at some points in time the reader may see things this way as well - until a better sense of ethics and morality sets in. <br /> <br />\\"Bury My Heart at Redtree\\" is an entertaining read that is well worth the money and the time to explore its pages.  The ending is unexpected and the journey towards that ending must be taken to appreciate the author's message. <br /> <br />Tyrone V. Banks	2005-07-07

I have just read and enjoyed Michael Hoffman's \\"The Coat That Covers Him and Other Stories.\\"  It was a long but worthwhile read written in a unique style. Six shorter stories set the mood for the main story.  An artful combination of plots drive these stories with subjects ranging from a man who believes that he is a murderer and is approached by a young girl  <br />looking to sell her body to him followed by a man who loses his key thus creating an unexpected chain of events that you'd never imagine. (The ideas are so witty and complex that I am allowing myself a run on sentence with this one!) <br />   <br /> The main story, however, is about Sidney Levin.  Sid is a well  <br />traveled man involved in a love triangle between his wife Natalie and his Japanese girlfriend Keiko. He lost Keiko as she married another man named Jon many years before.  After Jon dies, he pounces on the opportunity to rekindle that flame with Keiko. However, he willingly submits to the advances of Keiko's teenage daughter Mariko and she is impregnated.She moves in  <br />with her Uncle and Sid seems to settle for Natalie...but the story does not really end there...  <br />  <br /> These stories will engage various senses as you read, comprehend and \\"digest\\" the material.  It is written in a poetic form that grants the stories and the characters an added sense of tangibility as some of the emotions, reactions and responses are experienced by all of us in some small way. Hoffman's travels to Japan and Canada serve as a common  <br />theme as the characters always seem to end up or exist in one of those locations or the other, with Japan being the predominant location.  <br />  <br /> Add \\"The Coat That Covers Him and Other Stories.\\" to your Summer reading list!

The events that transpire will change them forever. <br /> <br />Luke Downing, who can be described as a murderous sociopath and his imaginary friend that directs his actions from within his own psyche, conceive a seemingly brilliant plan.  He will blackmail Peter and Hal, threatening to expose their exploits with Cindy unless they pay him for his silence.  All is going as planned until Cindy undermines Luke's plan by wading onto Garner Lake and drowning herself. <br /> <br />Peter and Hal return to their wives even more distant than before.  Not only do they have the weight of their infidelity to bear, but they also have Cindy's death on their consciences.  Therefore, when they return to Garner Lake for a sense of closure, they bring along their wives as well.  They are not prepared for Luke downing, his imaginary friend and Bruce Orum - but the evil trio are prepared for them.  Luke has decided that this will be the last time that Peter and Hal will go to Garner Lake and he has plans to kill them. When they arrive with their wives, the plans change as Luke plans on torturing and humiliating the two couples before killing them all. <br /> <br />Shadows at Garner Lake is a well written book loaded with excitement, terror, suspense and clever dialogue combined with character development.  The story is constantly moving and each character's role in the story is vital to its impact.  There are no loose ends and all questions are answered at the conclusion of the book. This is an excellent read and mentally stimulating.

These details provide a firm foundation upon which Myla will act and react to as she re-discovers distant memories and tragic events. <br /> <br />There are many similarities shared between Myla and the Author Miranda Beverly-Whittemore. She is from an artistic background and some of her writing has a poetic edge that can be seen within her colorful descriptions. The Author has also worked as a model and that gives her a unique insight into the main character's descriptions of various photo shoot terminology. The aforementioned items add credibility to the story and provide a unique and believable viewpoint that we will share with Myla as she searches for the truth.  <br /> <br />The Effects of Light is the debut work from an author with the ability to stimulate the senses through her artistic/poetic words and vivid imagery.

As they browse through the books they are pulled into a book and made into various characters that fight to retain the memories that will bring them back home.  Along the way your find yourself in the middle of adventures reminiscent of Dr. Seuss meets Alice in Wonderland meets Indiana Jones meets Sliders meets any other place that your imagination can create. <br /> <br /> The reluctant characters in someone else's twisted story are given choices.  These choices present themselves in the form of \\"3 Doors\\" that can lead the children home or deeper into the Abyss that has swallowed them. A part of you will cheer for them to enter the wrong door to see what they'll find while the other part will want them to arrive home safely. <br /> <br />\\"3 Doors\\" was originally conceived as a Screenplay and then rewritten as a novel.  The authors, sisters Kiane and Rochelle Simeon, write some of their characteristics, memories, traits or mishaps into their characters and the result is a well rounded cast of characters that the reader will feel some type of attachment to.

Reviewed by: Tyrone Vincent Banks <br /> <br />MAMA is a touching story that many of us, as parents and children, can relate to. It's a story being told by the older sister of a child who uses one word that encompasses all of his happiness, fears and needs.  The word is simply \\"Mama!\\"  The author, Kelly Jones, tells the story in a simple poetic format.  We look at the images and recall our first words or the first words of our children or siblings.  It is truly a miracle to watch a child evolve into the adult that they will become and we hope that they too will remember the adventures that they most certainly will find themselves involved in.   <br /> <br />As an individual I can recall my use of the word \\"Mama\\" several decades ago when times were simple and impossible problems were resolved by my mother.  I've told myself that I'd never talk like a grown up and refer to the \\"good old days\\" but in today's world you have to reflect on the past and the memories that comfort you as a child. <br /> <br />Long before the advanced animation and computer generated images that dominate the television and box office - books were first and foremost freehand artwork.  Even before that, collages have been used in artistic expression and they are finding their way back into the mainstream. The illustrator Ken Kewley has pieced together colorful images that can find themselves on a larger canvas to be immortalized as separate pieces of art.  <br /> <br /> MAMA is refreshing because as you turn the pages - or at least as I turned the pages - subconscious memories of my childhood were awakened.  I can remember \\"cartoons\\" of the past that utilized two-dimensional images interacting and moving across a colorful background.  I can recall the collage projects of the past and how they caused you to stretch your imagination and express your ideas. <br /> <br />I apologize for the lengthy dissertation about a 32 page book, but I feel that it's important to realize the various emotions that this book will stimulate.  It is an excellent book to read to children and those children may go on to read it to you as they get older.  The artwork makes it an excellent coffee-table book or conversation piece.  The story, in its simplicity and truth, can be one that a new parent will appreciate as well.  Either way, MAMA is a book that should be added to your library. <br />	2005-02-23

He is an albino with sensitivity to light and therefore he spends most of his time holed up in his dark apartment watching a Blade Runner DVD.  He spends his days working on a screenplay titled Los Angeles while taking medication washed down by cups of bourbon.  He's a self proclaimed loser by most accounts and he lives a rather uneventful life - or does he? <br /> <br />Angela comes into his life and she becomes the light that he has avoided for many years.  They spend time together engaged in conversation and he opens up his lonely existence and makes space for Angela.  He receives a call from her one day; she simply says his name and hangs up the phone.  From that moment forward he dedicates his life to rescuing Angela from and unknown foe that may have kidnapped or killed her. <br /> <br />Angel ventures out into the sunlight and starts his noble quest.  He can feel that Angela is in a dark place and waiting to be rescued.  As moments go by he is desperate and he fears that time is running out.  Through Angel's eyes and actions you can feel the loss of control and the uncertainty that he lives with.  He can be labeled as a schizophrenic, depressed alcoholic existing in a made up world.  Or, he can be labeled a heroic savior who overcomes his fears and anxieties to save the woman that he loves.  At times, while reading this book, both labels may apply.  But, even when the truth is revealed, you are still uncertain. <br /> <br />Peter Moore Smith has reincarnated Don Quixote as a delusional Angel Veronchek in search of his damsel in distress.  We must think that once the windmill is defeated it is still honorable that this Knight in Pale Skin challenged the Dragon just as Smith has challenged our imagination with a surreal tale about the line between sanity and insanity as it is breached. <br /> <br />LOS ANGELES: A NOVEL is enjoyable and well-written.  I guarantee that you will form a conclusion about the mystery that Angel is trying to solve only to find that all that may appear to be living and breathing - may not be. <br /> <br />	2005-02-23

Billions of people from all over the planet are affected by this deadly gas, most of them die but a select few survive.  The survivors experience enhanced ESP capabilities as they are forced to watch friends, families and loved ones perish. Most of them wonder why they were spared this same fate but in the meantime a massive effort has begun to assemble the survivors in one place to determine the future of what remains of humanity. <br />We experience stories from different states in which we read about mad men and women roaming the streets while survivors avoid them.  We read about small children loosing parents, husbands and wives widowed as a result of this gas and men in power with plans to exploit this tragedy for their own personal gains. One by one these individual stories become one story with diverse roles played out to a remarkable conclusion. <br />8 Days is written in an aggressive, truthful and shocking style.  When you read these pages you live out nightmares that few of us ever want to experience.  You are taken to emotional lows with your characters and you begin to hope that they rebuild their lives as the ones responsible receive their just punishment.  From page one I found myself captivated by this book.  The mental images of children forced to grow up too fast as they struggle to survive intertwine with images of people killing their loved ones in an act of violence or mercy. <br />This book has it all and its honesty and truth are brutal - but these aspects of this novel make the book the work of literary excellence.  Ms. Bumgarner is indeed an exemplary writer (she teaches Reading/Writing in the morning and she writes in the afternoon) and I've found out that she is writing a prequel to 8 Days. This book is a \\"must read\\" in every aspect! <br /> <br />Tyrone Vincent Banks <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-23

Reviewed by Tyrone Vincent Banks  <br /> <br />Skylar Knight is a typical teen age girl faced with a simple variety of problems that most teens are faced with today.  She's a junior in high school with a dilemma - she doesn't know how to kiss!  That is the surrounding theme to Secrets and Kisses but the central theme is a far more serious issue that involves lies, deception and murder! <br />Miss Popularity, in the form of one Blair Neuman - the daughter of a rich entrepreneur - is hosting a party at which a game called the \\"kissing game\\" will be played.  Obviously Skylar is nervous and she has even resorted to researching this topic in the library and checking out several books that will teach her the essentials.  Furthermore, to complicate matters, Skylar has a crush on another junior at her high school named Kedren Price.  Skylar is certain that she will be kissing someone and she has a feeling that this someone will be Kedren. <br />Kedren Price is central to the Secret aspect of this book.  For no obvious reason Kedren and Skylar constantly run into each other in the most unusual places.  On one of their meetings Kedren begins to interrogate Skylar about Blair Neuman and her family.  Although Skylar finds this to be rather odd, she answers all of Kedren's questions and she has questions about Kedren, particularly about the time Kedren spent out of town some years earlier.  All of the pieces will fall into place and you will be left with an entertaining story that will make you want more. <br />Celise Downs has created a provocative story about teenage America.  You visit a place where things are not as they seem.  Her stories have continuity as you find out the fate of Skylar and Kedren in her second book; Dance Jam Productions.  I am impressed by this book and the series that Celise has created.  She has given a voice to teenage America and created role-models that live fictitious but adventurous lives for teenagers to enjoy. <br />	2004-11-29

I advised the author that I was impressed with the cover - which set the tone for the wonderful story that was enclosed - and she passed the compliment on to her illustrator.  The matching bookmark and other enclosures made me envious of Celise Downs and her book - which is one of many to come. <br />Dance Jam Productions is a local television show similar to American Bandstand or Soul Train.  They are hosting a dance contest that will assemble a team of dancers that will become regulars on the show.  Mataya \\"Mattie\\" Black Hawk is a talented dancer with a secret past. Forever reminded of a personal tragedy that has scarred her for life, she expresses herself through dancing and music to escape from the load that she must bear.  Her confidant, protector and friend; Tykota Black Hawk, has cared for her since she was young and provides a positive environment for her to flourish in.  She has decided to enter Dance Jam Productions' contest and in doing so - she will change her life. <br />She meets Jarek Thanos in her dance studio one afternoon and they exchange words.  They both love to dance and are compatible in many ways - however - Mattie is cautious, she does not \\"let anyone in\\" too often.  The two are paired up at the dance contest and it is evident that they look well together.  While rehearsing for this contest - they kiss.  Mattie and Jarek feel a spiritual attraction to one another and after a twist of fate; Mattie is forced to tell Jarek \\"everything.\\" <br />That \\"everything\\" explains Mattie's physical appearance, including her beautiful blue-eyes.  There is so much more to this young lady and so many memories that have shaped her being.  Tykota, who is also a father-figure as well as a big brother to Mattie, also encourages Mattie tolet someone else in to aid in her healing process.  Mattie will let Jarek in and brief him on Tykota's mission.  Teenagers in the area are being abducted and their organs are being sold on the black market.  There is only one factor that unites all of the victims, Dance Jam Productions.  Mattie and Jarek must team up to prevent another horrible kidnapping and organ theft. <br />This book is one-third love story, one-third mystery and one-third action-adventure.  The words entice you to read on and all elements of the plot are strategically placed in a fashion that will captivate your imagination.  The end of the story is much like a new beginning and we are certain to find Mattie, Jarek and Tykota enthralled in another adventure soon.  Celise Downs has created a new type of hero, based on reality and created from flesh and blood as opposed to ink and paper.   <br />This book is a must read for young adults and adults, there is something for everyone at Dance Jam Productions. <br />	2004-11-24

I Found Myself Lost Within The Pages Of This Fast-Paced Thriller! <br /> <br />Reviewed by Tyrone Vincent Banks of Betsie's Literary Page. <br /> <br />This book opens with an image that sets the tone for this story.  Superman stands tall holding his wheelchair overhead, cameras flash as the room buzzes with simultaneous activity and Christopher Reeve - the Real Superman - has been cured of his paralysis.  He walks into the room as living proof that the much-debated stem-cell research does in fact work.  Being that Mr. Reeve passed away recently, I could not help but to feel sorrow for that real life event.  However, the tale that follows this impressive opening made me feel triumphant and hopeful. <br />Dr. Michael Preston and his younger brother Matt are hit by a vehicle being driven by an intoxicated individual who has changed the brothers' lives and relationship.  Matt is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair and Dr. Preston blames himself for this unforeseen disaster.  The Doctor spends most of his time following any research that will give his brother a chance to walk again. <br />After many years of research and dead ends, Dr. Preston receives information about a medical team lead by a Dr. Kilmer who claims that they have cured paralysis.  Dr. Preston has been hand selected to join the team and is pre-warned that there is a group called the Covenant who have vowed to prevent the cure from being made available to the public.  This group will block any and all attempts at curing paralysis by utilizing any means necessary.  The Covenant resorts to mercenary tactics that usually leave their victims dead and therefore unable to work towards this cure. Many scientists and Doctors have already been murdered and Dr. Kilmer and his daughter Kayla may be next. <br /> The Covenant is motivated by money and greed.  If a cure is found, the financial backing for insurance companies and other research fronts would simply dissolve. It is similar to the financial ruin that most fuel companies would find themselves subject to should an engine be developed without any fuel requirements.  Therefore, the financial factor has outweighed the human factor and Dr. Preston and other \\"players\\" have to prevent the Covenant from carrying out the vow that they have made to each other. <br />The vivid scenes and characters converge towards a final showdown of good against evil.  Dr. Preston is working towards curing his brother and preserving his own life in the process as they are tracked by the mercenaries hired by the Covenant.  A mystery, a medical thriller and a love story form the pieces of Revealing the Covenant and the surprise ending will fascinate you as well. <br />Rusty Van Reeves has woven aspects of his life into his characters.  He has a spinal chord injury that has left him paralyzed from the shoulders down and is hopeful that a cure will be found.  However, much like Dr. Preston's brother Matt, he realizes that life must go on in the meantime.  Like Matt, he has his own software company.  He writes, using one finger, to tell a story and express innermost emotions.  He writes vivid poetry and he is also an excellent painter (he can paint quite well with a brush placed between his teeth.)  <br />Revealing the Covenant is a remarkable book written by a remarkable Artist - in every sense of the word.  To learn of the Author before or after reading his work will allow you to appreciate his unbreakable spirit and his powerful words.  I've enjoyed this book and I look forward to his future projects. <br /> <br />\\"We live in a time when the words impossible and unsolvable are no longer part of the scientific community's vocabulary.

There is little that can occur in this small town that will remain secret or unknown.  Derek has questions of his own, primarily about the \\"black-sheep\\" of his family; Uncle Sim.  Derek has questions about Uncle Sim, who is his father's cousin, but when he questions his father about this relative, he receives very brief and guarded answers.  On a day when Derek speaks to Uncle Sim, his father rushes to Sim's home and warns his cousin to stay away from his son.  Sim's reply, \\"I'll get even with your some day.\\" <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Thus, the reader has questions and this piece of fiction becomes a mystery novel of sorts.  Little by little we learn more about Sim as viewed through Derek's eyes.  Sim introduces Derek to a world of drugs, lies, vengeance and murder. We see Derek grow away from his childhood friends Kyle, Leslie and James.  One of them, however, will become one of Sim's victims as he carries out a plot to get even with Derek's father. This story can happen in any town and many have seen what drugs can do to people.  The ones that sell or use will never be the same.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> We grow up with Derek, meeting his friends, as they were children and viewing their progress and fate as the pages of this book turn.  Liz Rohloff is a talented writer and that talent is evident as you find yourself lost in the pages.  Her characters portray the personal traits of many of our own childhood friends that either fail or succeed in spite of everyone's expectations. I think of the movie; Less Than Zero as I ponder the message relayed.  Derek is that friend who took the wrong path and made some unwise choices in spite of his personal beliefs. A recurring theme throughout the book as stated by some of the characters was to \\"control the drug and not let it control you.\\"  However, the message is simple and painfully true - if you deal withor in illegal drugs - your life is no longer in your hands <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />I can see this book as a springboard for Liz Rohloff and many advocates who want to remove drugs from the hands and lives of our youths. Liz Rohloff's book will show you a scenario that's more realistic and one that we know to be true.  The book flowed along remarkably and the end was one that some would expect and others will never forget. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Uncle Sim's was a tragic but very readable piece of fiction based on many remnants of non-fiction. You will enjoy the book and its message. Drug usage and abuse is not selective. It can happen to anyone anywhere and this book will tell a story that can be everyone's story in some manner. I thank Liz Rohloff for her research and insight that gave a living and breathing problem another personification to examine - and prevent. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Tyrone Vincent Banks of Betsie's Literary Page. <br />	2004-11-16

Reviewed by: Tyrone Vincent Banks of Betsie's Literary Page. <br /> <br />A well written thriller and an exciting love story. <br /> <br /> <br />Carly Manning encounters a group of men on a road after loosing control of her vehicle.  She realizes that she has stumbled into the wrong place at the wrong time, but fortunately, she mentions the name of a mutual acquaintance and the group agrees to assist her.  She meets Ken Morgan, a charismatic musician and the leader of a group called \\"The Compound.\\"  As Carly and Ken interact with one another you get the distinct impression that they are meant to be together.  From that point forward they have begun an adventure that becomes the plot for The Compound. <br />Most espionage type thrillers consist of two dimensional characters that simply do what you expect them to do.  Without conscience or remorse they bed anyone necessary to achieve their objective.  Although Carly and Ken are attractive and attracted to each other, they keep a respectable distance from one another.  That fact creates a cloak of sexual tension that the reader can detect on any page on which the names Ken and Carly are mentioned together.  It is as if they want to put their past \\"exploits\\" behind them and experience true love.  Both characters have a colorful past in which \\"love\\" simply means sexual relations, but that may change as the hero and heroine fall deeply in love. <br />Ken has become Carly's protector in a sense.  From her innermost thoughts you can sense that she can take care of herself but she allows Ken to defend her, mainly from some of the other members of Ken's team.  Now, the tables have turned and Carly must fight to save Ken from his destruction.  His team, the Compound, has become obsolete and an assassin has been sent to bring Ken down.  Carly has decided that she will do what is necessary to save the man that she loves. Will she fail?  Will she succeed? Is she more than what she appears to be?  Read the book and you will surrender yourself to a literary roller-coaster that you will not be able to put down. <br />A three dimensional plot has been merged with two three dimensional characters to create a realistic adventure that will entice and entertain the senses.  Enter The Compound and sample the work of Gloria Shepherd.  Ms. Shepherd is a seasoned, veteran writer with the ability to create believable characters tackling realistic issues.  She writes with a romantic edge that will draw multiple audiences into the book with a desire to see how the book ends.  Do the two heroes fall in love and stay together?  Or, will the covert world of espionage tear them apart?  I'm not going to tell... <br />	2004-11-03

There were those who suffered during the depression, war and other disasters, but, as it has been said by millions - no one could ever imagine the events of 9-11.  However, there is another tragedy amidst many other tragedies that we have faced, and will face. <br /> <br />Two figures wearing long black trench coats converge on a building carrying a bag of weapons.  Utilizing various shotguns and semi-automatic weapons they begin to fire at the occupants of this building.  This is not a scene from a movie - it is what is known as the worst U.S. school shooting in history.  This is the Columbine Massacre.  On April 20, 1999, 15 students perished - 13 innocent students and 2 gunmen.  On that same day, 21 were injured. <br /> <br />Later we found out that the students were planning this for over a year.  Others asked where they could attain such destructive resources and the mindset to carry out such a dastardly plan.  Some exclaimed: \\"Where were their parents?  Didn't they know?\\"  This is where this book comes in.  Dr. Druck and his motivated colleagues have created a guide that has been written to help parents protect their kids from violence and to prevent any violence that their children may carry out. <br /> <br />It is not designed as a \\"cure\\" to the sickness that violence has become.  Society has become desensitized to violence.  We see it in movies, on websites, video games, and sports events and even in the cartoons that our children watch.  We wonder where the resources come from.  Just go to your computer and type in anything and the answer - in detail - will flash on your screen within moments.  The previous statements have determined the mindset and resources and now anotherfactor has to be discussed; prevention. <br /> <br />How to Talk to Your Kids About School Violence has outlined a proactive course of prevention.  It starts with parents becoming role models in spite of their imperfections and the experiences that have molded them into the adults that they have become.  We want our children to live better lives.  There has always been a focus on avoiding strangers and not getting into strange vehicles - but now we must include scenarios in which kids bring weapons to school.  It doesn't matter if you think that your kid is too young to carry out such plans, as mentioned earlier, violence and vengeance surrounds our children on a daily basis.  We must teach them to report weapons or other destructive mediums to adults in authority.  We must talk to our children, in a non-judgmental/non confrontational manner to defeat violent thoughts before they are acted upon. <br /> <br />Parents are the first line of defense and sometimes the persons that kids rely on as a basis for their decisions.  If we make poor decisions they may be cursed with doing the same thing.  Open communication is the first step to preventing violence.  The \\"that will never happen to my kid!\\" mentality has to be defeated if we want to protect our children.  How to Talk to Your Kids About School Violence includes the statistics, resources and game-plan for helping our children thrive in this difficult world.  There are several \\"what-if\\" scenarios included to help you conquer the unknown questions or subjects that you may face. <br /> <br />We live in a violent world and education and information may be the only shields that will protect you against this violence.  How to Talk to Your Kids About School Violence may be one of the first steps in helping your child cope with the pressures of society and make positive decisions.  Even if you think that you have all of the answers, keep this fact in mind, the questions have changed. <br />	2004-11-03

Reviewed by: Tyrone Vincent Banks of Betsie's Literary Page. <br /> <br />An eye opening interpretation of the Bible. <br /> <br /> <br />As I began the process of reading this book, I opened the cover slowly knowing that it was not a work of fiction.  I've read Revelations several times, however only focusing on the parts that I thought I would understand and fearful of the other parts.  Ronald Weinland described this section of the bible in great detail and explained how current events move us towards the Apocalypse on a daily basis.  I became more and more aware of how mankind has defied God with the senseless murders and other acts of violence that have jumped off of the movie screen and onto the evening news or various websites. <br /> <br />I don't want to believe that our time on earth will come to an end soon.  Oftentimes I try to keep those thought out of my head - unsuccessfully.  This book gave meaning to those thoughts but now I await the signs of the \\"end time.\\" Weinland has stated that we were given 6,000 years of self-rule and God's kingdom will replace the \\"kingdom of man.\\"  He also stated that to date, only one being has entered heaven, and that being is Christ.  Weinland also mentioned that there will be an imminent power shift from the nation that is perceived as the most powerful.  Now, keep in mind, these items were developed within the first few pages and then developed - in laymen's terms - throughout the book. <br /> <br />Many people will be skeptical and refuse to believe that these events will occur.  Weinland has prefaced his words with the basis for his findings (the bible) and the religious standpoint that he views these events from.  In the end, the decision is yours and you must try to do what must be done to prepare for these events that have been prophesied, Weinland is offering advice and a course to follow. <br /> <br />I respect the author's religious views and applaud him for placing his name and reputation on the line to bringthese difficult facts to our attention.  If we can unify as a planet and try to get within the good grace of God, by whatever name he takes in our hearts, maybe there's a chance.  I'd like to believe this but in the meantime we will have to watch and hope.  As I look at the world today and the course that it's taking, I pray that there is a resolution and a brotherhood of all humanity.  If you say the Lord's Prayer, say the words slowly and digest each and every word, especially the following: <br /> <br />Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven...  <br /> <br />\\"The Prophesied End-time\\" has opened a hidden door in my soul and as I step inside, I am beginning to grasp at what will become of the world if we continue this course.  As every book should, it will mean something different for each and every reader - this review is merely what I've taken from this book. You, on the other hand, may gain so much more by reading these pages as well. <br />	2004-10-22

Duval has written this book to aid those who are still scarred by the horrific events of September 11, 2001.  Many of us have heard the calming words and reassurances of our spiritual and political leaders as the country existed for a short time blanketed by American flags and patriotic assemblies.  The events of 9/11 became a call to arms as our country retaliated by attacking those that have caused us such pain and terror.  We are now enthralled in a war spawned by this cowardly act and now more blood is spilling.  Many of us feel that the country is spiraling towards a decay that cannot be stopped.  In the authors own description we are now in a broken state and this brokenness can be repaired through God. <br /> <br />Many have moved past 9/11 and focus intently on the combat in the Middle East.  We want to see justice and those responsible punished for their acts.  As this broken country struggles to rebound from 9/11 many are pointing fingers with the hopes that blaming someone else will serve as a form of retribution.  This surreal event - the tragic morning on September 11, 2001 will never leave our minds and will always be in our hearts - but there is a way to heal. <br /> <br />We must not blame God for this tragedy.  Instead, we must stand tall and work harder at strengthening our resolve to honor and respect each other.  We are given a chance to rebuild our lives and make it better.  Dr. Duval compares our country to Christ and the pain and death that he overcame.  He was \\"broken\\" beyond repair however, he was resurrected and his words and love continues to comfort those in need of spiritual healing. <br /> <br />I can recall that tragic day and the days that followed.  People were kind to each other as we shared in the hurt and pain.  Every house displayed the American Flag proudly and the\\"Proud to be an American\\" bumper stickers adorned every vehicle.  Individual differences did not matter, 9/11 affected many countries in different ways and we enjoyed a brotherhood that you rarely see today.  For a moment, just a moment, the tragedy created a society where crime rates dropped, people were kind to each other and we comforted anyone in need of comfort. <br />As time went by, that all dissolved and continues to fade away. <br /> <br />\\"America After Siege: Roadmap to Victory After 9/11\\" should be read as you read the bible or whatever book represents your faith.  America has been given a chance to be reborn out of the ashes of 9/11.  Together we can go forward and live the lives as dictated by God, Allah or whatever deity you choose to worship. <br /> <br />This book will open up a train of thought and internal reflection that will vary depending on the person reading these words.  Instead of reviewing this book and relaying the poetry and words that I've read, I have chosen to digest these words and make them a part of myself.  I challenge myself to return to the brotherhood and Christianity that enveloped my being after 9/11.  I have not forgotten the events but I now remind myself of the calm that followed the storm prior to our quest for justice.  The battle will continue to rage and those who do not fight as instruments of war can become instruments of faith. <br /> <br />Even if you believe that you have \\"healed\\" emotionally after 9/11, read this book and you will be enlightened.  Dr. Duval's simple words represent complex feelings and emotions that are necessary to embrace as we move forward with our lives.  Read this book and share it with others.  There is a message to spread and that message starts with you...  <br /> <br />	2004-10-05

Reviewed by: Tyrone Vincent Banks of Betsie's Literary Page. <br /> <br />An incredible journey as seen through the eyes of a child. <br /> <br /> <br />At an early age Jd had already experienced a gamut of heartache, rejection and loss following the death of his mother.  His father, who was rarely there, left his children to fend for themselves as he looked for work and a replacement for his late wife.  He sends his four children to an orphanage, at which Jd is promised that he will not be separated from his brothers, who are the only family that he ever truly knew.  When he and his brothers were removed from the orphanage temporarily to meet their new mother and celebrate Christmas, Jd was ignored and received no gifts from his family.  Although that was not worse than the death of his mother, Jd marks this occasion as the worse day in his life. <br /> <br />Thus we begin the cycle of rebellion and hatred towards adults.  He is separated from his brothers and beaten daily in response to his rebellious behavior.  The beatings have no effect on him, for the harm done to his body pales in comparison to the psychological scars that he will always bear. He continues his cycle or rebellion interlaced with constant attempts to escape the orphanage.  The adults continue to beat him and force him to accept religion but no one ever addresses the root cause of his behavior.  Jd is very doubtful that God is concerned about his fate and feels that he has nothing to lose.  They want to break him like a wild stallion but Jd knows that he is destined to be free and one day - he escapes. <br /> <br />Jd, who is less than 8 years old at the time, sets out into the world to find his own way.  He travels across the country alone, buying or stealing what he needs along the way.  He rides with a band of Gypsies for a spell and is even employed by bootleggers for a period of time.  No matter what young Jd sets his hands and mind to, he is successful.  He acquires two dogs in histravels; they become the only family that young Jd needs to survive the dangerous world. <br /> <br />Jd begins to find himself and faith in God.  In the most perilous times, as Jd calls out to God for assistance, he is given whatever he is in need of.  His adventures lead him to different parts of the world where he leaves a favorable impression on adults who respect his rights to govern his own destiny.  His faith in God and in adults is restored, but, for how long?  It seems that everything the world gives to Jd is almost surely taken away, but Jd will press on in pursuit of his destiny with the hopes that he and his brothers will be reunited some day. <br /> <br />This is a captivating story of survival against all odds.  Shippinbow weaves a very entertaining tale reminiscent of some of Twain's classics.  The book includes vivid detail told from the first-person point of view and you can see and understand some of Jd's motivations that cause him to be the way that he is.  Each word will entice you to read the next and you are almost unaware that you are turning the pages of a book as the scenes melt together with no wasted detail.  There are a few pages with drawings of the characters or certain events and places - as if you are truly reading from a journal. <br /> <br />The main character is so young and I would hope that there are more installments to \\"The Vignettes of Jd\\".

Reviewed by: Tyrone Vincent Banks of Betsie's Literary Page. <br /> <br />An action packed thriller about a father's quest to save his children. <br /> <br />Ever since Henry Ellis lost his wife, his twins have been the focal point of his life.  He still felt the pain of being a widower, and he has realized that he could not control the events that took his wife from him.  However, when the plane carrying his children to Spain was hijacked, Henry Ellis vowed to do anything possible to save them.  Henry was aware of the President's refusal to negotiate with terrorists; therefore he has rested the responsibility for liberating the twins squarely on his own shoulders. <br /> <br />He arrives in Spain where he makes contact with the \\"underground\\" through a priest and \\"old men\\" from his family's past.  He makes some startling realizations about the \\"old men\\" that his mother advised him to be wary of and realizes that they may be behind the bloody hijacking that has been orchestrated.  Ellis exists now in a world about which he was uncertain and learns to trust no one.  He learns about his father, a \\"hero\\" who died for the cause many decades ago and now questions if he really was a hero or just a terrorist similar to the ones who were now holding his children and killing the passengers one at a time. <br /> <br />Douglas Quinn delivers a truly captivating and gritty story.  His writing style is very honest and frank.  His use of imagery and bloody, vivid descriptions are not to frighten us - they are to enlighten us.  It's an emotional roller coaster ride as you shift between the events that involve Henry Ellis, the U.S. Government and the terrorists. Scenes are written and at the last word a major event unfolds and the reader will draw his or her own conclusions, only to have them rebuffed at the beginning or middle of the next scene. <br /> <br />This book has it all - love, action, drama, mystery, suspense and a small dose of horror.  All of these key elements reside between the pages of \\"The Catalan Gambit\\" and you will enjoy this book.  It is an adult read that chronicles the Post 9-11 society that we live in and it will frighten you and then relieve you in some ways.  This cycle of emotions will repeat throughout this work and captivate you in the process.   <br /> <br />Prepare yourself for the ultimate action movie when you read \\"The Catalan Gambit\\" by Douglas Quinn.  This book has it all, so, give it a read! <br />	2004-09-17

Throughout most of his life he existed as an outsider, scorned by his family and laughed at by children and adults alike.  What he lacked in social grace, common sense and intelligence was compensated for by his beautiful singing voice, peaceful demeanor and compassion.  He was an outcast suffering from a disease that left gaping sores about his face that would never heal.  His father Prince was afraid that he would never leave his home and therefore stifle his own search for a bride to replace Dada's deceased mother.  Prince embarked on a campaign to build a life for his son and make him comply with his vision of success. <br /> <br />Dada saw no harm in the way that he lived.  As long as there was food, a way to care for his crippled friend Twig and his grandmother - he was content.  One day, he failed his father for the last time by setting Prince's livestock free and letting the water supply run dry.  As Dada ran for his life with his father at wit's end threatening to kill him, his life changed.  He was given a vision and a magical gourd that could fill a well as if an endless supply of water was enclosed within the small container.  He was changing and he rushed to the side of his dying grandmother - and healed her with an embrace.  The wounds that covered his face - disappeared.  Dada's eyes opened and he was no longer an uninterested observer, he was now an instrument of change. <br /> <br />Dada became an instrument of God, much like the gourd that contained the endless supply of water; he was filled with the power of God.  He established a place of worship called The Balm Yard and the miracles continued.  All that he touched were healed and he took on a new name - Brother Walk. He would travel throughout Albion, Jamaica preachingand healing all within reach.  Brother Walk was reborn and in this new form he learns about love, sensuality, self-sacrifice and temptation.  He is given an endless amount of power and his followers hang on every word that leaves his mouth.  However, we all know what happens with absolute power. This book has an ending that is both surprising and expected.   <br /> <br />Read this book and take part in this journey reminiscent of Daniel Keyes' \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" and the motion picture \\"Phenomenon\\" told with the classic flair of Steinbeck.  The journey is mystical and enjoyable and Beresford McLean's style is similar to that of a revered storyteller.  His words and images will capture you and you will carry this story in your heart. <br />	2004-09-03

I've often wondered about the journey that we take when we pass away.  Does everything fade away or do the memories that we've harbored begin to come to light; causing you to seek answers to forgotten questions?  I've often heard of restless spirits roaming our dimension unable to crossover due to problems or unfinished business.  I've heard of spirits who refuse to move on, but not of spirits who choose to enroll in a job placement program to continue working in the realm between death and paradise!  This fact is the one that comforts me the most and it is a refreshing theory. <br />  <br />The previous paragraph describes one of many sub-plots that the author uses in combination with other characters and situations to develop this story.  There are many characters and plots that weave the complex fabric that will become this well written story.  The central story revolves around the plight of George, our main character. <br />  <br />George returns to his hometown after a long absence.  He wants to make peace with the childhood home that he was forced to leave abruptly.  He also has a desire to discover the origin of a nightmare that has haunted him for several years.  He meets Clara at a caf and she becomes his guide.  She leads him through the streets of his hometown and also towards the startling realization that George had not yet acknowledged.  Unbeknownst to George - he is dead. <br />  <br />Clara and George search for the origin of the haunting nightmare and then realize that their destinies were intertwined.  They have to solve a murder case that has remained unresolved for three decades.  They utilize details from two very unique perspectives.  George is a witness to a horrific murder while Clara is the victim.  They investigate this mystery through contacts within the spiritual world and psychic contact with those of the living world.  Once that mystery is solved they will have the option to cross the meadow, passing on to the other side with millionsof other spirits who realize that their time is up.  <br />  <br />The plot is complex and well thought out.  This book is entertaining and worthy of every second of your time.

The poetry touches on a large collective of emotions and will make you see things that you may take for granted from a different angle.  The author talks about herself and the image that she projects to others where as there is so much more to her - most of which is revealed in this book.  The poems are of various styles and most of them could also be sung (I can't sing, so I didn't try...) In her poetry I can see her ability to write musical lyrics.  Open her book to any page and think of the words musically and you will appreciate this book even more. <br /> <br />Most of the poetry addresses difficult emotions that adults seem to think that they own. However, today's teenagers and children see far more and experience more stimuli than previous generations did.  I was born during the Vietnam War era but the war raged, as I played at home, unaware of any chaos.  Today, children have seen the videos of 9-11 and are aware of the way that humans hurt each other.  They are not shielded from the reality of this planet and Brittany Rene's poetry speaks of these issues.  Read the poems Richy Rich and Peace On Earth and you will see that Brittany - and almost all teenagers - will not be denied the truth.  They watch and they see the pain and they are not too young to feel a part of this pain as well. <br /> <br />She addresses the love that she has for her parents for being there for her when she needed a shoulder to cry on or a dose of inspiration.  She talks of abusive relationships as well as healthy ones, love found and love lost, of Angels and Satan.  All of these very facets of human life are forever viewed by an ever-present God that we should seek to appease before our indiscretions do us in.  This is awell-rounded book of poetry and the message is so varied yet so clear.  I share Brittany Rene's opinion that \\" Even when you think no one understands...there is always someone out there thinking the same thing.  Words sever relationships throughout life, but they also bond us for ever. <br /> <br />Thank you Brittany for sharing this part of your soul with us and I look forward to your next poetry collection: Dusty Angel. <br />	2004-07-25

He doesn't want his mistakes or miscalculations to affect others.  He has the heart of a warrior, which is proven while he is engaged in battle during the Vietnam War.  During this war he survives several injuries and several months as a P.O.W.  In the words of the author, D.J. Stephens, \\"He was a survivor and stayed alive for over forty-five years by counting on himself and his instincts.\\"<BR> <BR>Jeff felt as if he was truly alive in the outdoors and this feeling helped him escape from the fast pace of his life in Chicago.  For this reason he went elk hunting in Montana and he finally caught a glimpse of what makes him the man that he is today.  The surroundings are familiar and he knows far more about this territory than he can give himself credit for.  The great elk, the subject of his hunt, stands nearby.  <BR> <br />After a successful hunt, a powerful grizzly attacks Jeff Barkil.  Jeff miraculously triumphs over the grizzly bear but he is seriously injured.  He loses consciousness and awakens in a tent in Blackfoot Indian Territory, in the 1780's where he has been nursed back to health.  He is given the name Bearkiller in acknowledgement of his victory over the creature that will soon become a part of his being.<BR> <BR>The Blackfoot Indians take in this warrior with blond hair and blue eyes and soon they disregard his differences and allow him to join the tribe.

I do not know much about Native American rituals, beliefs or customs, but I feel that they are actively portrayed by D.J. Stephens - as if he's lived those experiences for himself.

First of all, the vibrant cover of the Union Soldier in front of the Stars and Stripes made this book jump off of the shelves.  To look at the cover is to be invited inside to journey back into time.<br />Fathers, Sons and Brothers is a story told from the vantage point of Nathan S. Clark.  Clark is an Irish immigrant and patriot that left home soon after his marriage to the woman that he loves to fight for the country in the Civil War.  He is a member of the Twentieth Main Infantry Regiment and he is seen as a leader by his superiors from the beginning.  He feels that the war is just, even though he does not savor the fact that he will be taking lives, he is determined to carry out his orders.<br />He and his regiment battle the weather, disease and fear as they march towards their objective.  His service is dotted with several skirmishes and a first hand view of the horrors of war.  However, Gus Filegar will show you the human side of this struggle.  With the violence that is a part of any war, he will also show you compassion and mercy for those who take up arms on opposite sides of the battlefield.<br />The writing is extremely descriptive and the vivid details will take you as close to the battle as you would like to go.  You see the men charge into battle, you see them fall on the battlefield and you see the medics struggle to piece together the mutilated parts to make the soldiers whole again.  You see the sacrifice and feel the pain.  You enjoy the small comforts that the men enjoy - such as hot coffee and stale bread.  You travel into a world where soldiers die on the battlefield due to the munitions or the biting cold.<br />As you read this you realize that these things actually happened.  A country united once to escape from the watchful eye of Great Britain now drawing a line between the North and South and battling for independence from the other's ideals and beliefs.  This book has it all and it will pique your curiosity and perhaps you will go on a fact-finding mission to learn more.  While on that mission you learn of the plight that every soldier faces as they lay down their lives for a cause and develop a new sense of respect for this \\"career\\".<br />Read this book and digest every word, just as I have, and you will appreciate the level of craftsmanship that this book contains.  It is well worth one or two evenings to travel with the Civil War historian Gus Filegar and perhaps understand why he had to write this book.  It wasn't just for him; it was for all of us.(...)	2004-07-01

With this \\"evidence\\" he realizes that what he thought was a dream - was real.<br />Using modern-day science and reason he is the solution to an ancient problem that coincides with an ancient prophesy.

Stripped of his wings and taking up residence upon the planet's surface, Satan evolves and reincarnates himself as necessary to survive.  For a period of time, he resided in Atlantis, the continent that now exists in a quasi-dimensional state drifting beneath the ocean.  He leaves Atlantis and finds himself on the planet Earth.  He lives through many historical moments from the tempting of Christ to a position working closely with Adolph Hitler to the search for Osama bin Laden.  He fathers many children and is mostly unaware of what they have or will become.<br />The Earth is now threatened with annihilation caused by a shower of meteoroids that are heading towards the planet.  Satan must lead a team into Atlantis, shift its position and therefore cause the position of the Earth to shift as well to avoid destruction.  During this journey he questions what he has become and he begins to long for the wings that he lost so many centuries earlier.  He professes his love for Christ and what he stood for and begins to accept the fact that he is becoming more \\"human\\".  He considers himself to be the one assigned to do God's \\"dirty work\\" and realizes that he is a necessary entity.<br />This book is not only impressive in appearance, it also impressive as a medium to be used to ask the hard questions about the roots of good and evil.  It is written in first person and the reader is privy to private emotions and random thoughts that convey the story quite well.  Like the author we wonder what Satan's true motivations are.  There are so many words written about God and Christ but little written about the origin of Satan and the purpose that he serves.<br />Could it be that Satan is simply a way to balance and regulate good and evil? Why was he caste out ofheaven and does he long to return?  Unfortunately, no one (that I know of) has the true and correct answer but the author spins a rather interesting tale laced with current events and bound by some historical facts and data.

Joe Connally kept a diary in which he faithfully recorded the daily activities of his young daughter, Alice Mary.  Joe lost his wife and Alice Mary lost her mother on December 31,1943.  During this time, although surrounded by family, Joe and Alice Mary shared a special bond that was created by Alice Sr.'s untimely death.  This diary chronicles the daily events as they unfolded during the World War II era as seen through Joe's eyes and Alice Mary's memories.    This book is definitely a touching tribute to the love between a parent and their offspring.  As I read through the pages I felt as if I lived during that era and experienced the turmoil and tranquility firsthand.  I could see a lot of my daughter's characteristics in the young Alice Mary and this book touched my soul in a special way.    Alice Mary has paid tribute to her father and she has created something that will live on forever in print.  The diary entries are separated by quotes, anecdotes and even the last words of famous personalities.  It is a very entertaining and smooth read that you will definitely enjoy.  The plot is just as uncertain as life itself and as you read the pages you experience the spontaneous emotions and feelings that have always been a part of human life, but from a unique standpoint.    What I take from this book is this. Love your loved ones and cherish them as if they will be gone tomorrow.  No one's time on earth is promised and each moment is a precious entry in the diary that chronicles your life experiences.  I commend the author for committing this work to print and I thank her for sharing this personal experience with us.	2004-04-16

Through beautiful color photographs, we watch first hand the passage of time beginning with Francis's arrival into the author's life.  We watch the small sparrow grow until he \\"leaves the human's nest.\\"  This book serves as a reminder that every creature, human or nonhuman, can flourish and grow with love.<br />It is obvious that the author remained patient and nurturing as the photographs were taken.  These color photographs of the small bird against a soft satin-like background highlight this book's simplicity.  I read this one to my 6-year-old daughter last night and many children will echo her words.  As I closed the book she asked me, \\"Daddy, can I bring this to show and tell?\\"<br />Excellent job Francis!  Tell your assistant Carla C. Cain that we look forward to hearing from you both again!  Thank you for reminding me of how one simple, loving action can enhance the lives of the person giving and receiving this wonderful emotion.<br />Tyrone Vincent Banks of Betsie's Literary Page	2004-03-15

Reviewed by: Tyrone Banks of Betsie's Literary Page <BR>Recommended <BR>5 out of 5 points<br />Horror at its deepest level, unleashed from within.  Read the words, visualize the scene and be scared!<br />When I read the back cover of After the Fall, as I do every time I begin reading a book, I was immediately drawn into the plot.  I had the pleasure of reading an excerpt back in July 2003 and I thought that I knew where the story was going.  I visualized this to be a story about love lost and obsession.  I assumed that the plot would unfold to reveal a horrific scene brought on by jealously or mistrust.  However, by the thirteenth page, I discovered that I was wrong.<br />This book goes deeper than any simple obsession.  Jayce Paul, the main character, needs her ex-boyfriend King Brown in many ways.  He was the one that kept her grounded. He was the only one that she wanted in her life.  He was the only one that could pull her back from the demons that were obsessed with Jayce - literally.  Jayce Paul had many demons that struggled to keep her within their realm and those demons had grown tired of King Brown and his constant heroics.  Therefore, as he pulled her back from their grasp, they sent more demons to punish him for his interference.<br />Through vivid description the author explains the chaos, the pain and the blood that is spilled in this power struggle. If you visualize this as if watching a horror movie, you will be scared as surprises wait in the shadows and leap out at every corner.  Monica Russell has just begun to tell the stories that play out in her mind and roam the plains of her dark side.  I am confident that with each and every book that follows, she will continue to live out her dream - of giving you nightmares.	2004-02-21

However, as I read the first words of this novel and proceeded to the conclusion, I did not want to miss one word!  I found myself reading and rereading various sections in an attempt to take in every aspect of this book with no exceptions.  <br />In Señor Estrada's novel, he begins by painting a diverse and colorful background utilizing culture rich Havana.  He assembles a combination of visual and physical necessities that create a backdrop in front of which this novel unfolds.  Each character is meticulously developed through the writing and their actions described by our narrator.  Once developed, these multi-faceted characters interact with the multi-faceted background to play out the story.<br />Enter Harvard educated Javier Lopez Angulo and legendary American writer <BR>Ernest Hemingway, two of the author's main characters that form a bond after a near miss - with each others' fists.  The two form a bond of sorts and Javier leads Ernest &quot;call me Papa&quot; Hemingway through Cuba in a series of interesting events that take place prior to and during the violence that enthralls Cuba as it approaches the prohibition era riddled with social revolution.<br />In the author's descriptions, you sit at a small table in the nightclubs Javier and Hemingway frequent.  You watch the two of them drinking together, engaged in conversation about the ladies or the fishing - two of Hemingway's many passions.  Every so often you witness a patron in the bar challenge Hemingway to a fight, only to be disposed of in a melee that entertains the crowd immensely.<br />The two characters cross each other often, either in boxing matches or in matters of the heart.  You get the sense that their relationship is evolving from a state of serenity to that of rivalry.  Just like the Cuba that they live in during this time, things are going to change and they do.  Señor Estrada will take you on this personal journey in an attempt to discover what caused the rift in the relationship between his grandfather and Hemingway.  You unravel this mystery utilizing Estrada's visual artistry in due time but every word from beginning to end will captivate you instantly.<br />Add this one to your library, just as I have and revisit it often.  <br />Señor Estrada, thank you for the journey!	2004-02-18

Absolutely breathtaking from the beginning to the end!<br />I received Mr. Cummings' Media Kit almost 2 weeks ago and the level of perfection portrayed by the documents enclosed has also been applied to his novel. Mr. Cummings has done an excellent job in the development of the plot and the characters that are bound to the pages of Opening Bell. You can see a sense of purpose similar to that of John Grisham, where current events take on a life of their own.<br />Marc Reid is an intelligent, calculating, wealthy and able man - with a vision of perfecting welfare, eliminating affirmative action and downsizing the corrupt government. These are a few of the motivations that have inspired Marc Reid to plot a takeover of that government, a plan that took over 20 years to reach fruition. He has recruited a team of \\"visionaries\\" with similar goals and on May 10, 2010 at 8:30 A.M. they take over the financial functions regulated by computer and effectively take over the United States of America.<br />Marc has his own personal motivations for this coup d'etat (The sudden overthrow of a government by a usually small group of persons in or previously in positions of authority.) In his late teenage years he felt that he was the victim of government policy as he witnessed the demise of his small but affluent family. His father's fortune was \\"stolen\\" by the family's attorney and his mother was reduced from a proud matron of the household to a prisoner of a reality that she created to deal with the tragedies that poured into her life.<BR> <BR>Marc was powerless to make any effective change to his life during that time. Therefore, as an adult, he created and executed this plan to effectively change everyone's life and exact vengeance at the same time. Somewhere between Marc's vision of a better society where welfare and the IRS no longer existed and the stifling bureaucracy was downsized, Marc's vengeful goals were accomplished. His own personal agenda became the country's agenda. He had attained a level of power that one could even consider a dictatorship. Even his fellow revolutionaries could see that their goal was over exceeded and Marc's will controlled everything.<br />This is a true journey through the harsh cycle of power and helplessness. A lot of issues inspired by nonfiction are included and developed by this piece of fiction. Opening Bell is a beautiful book for your library as well as an excellent and well-planned novel.	2003-12-16

First of all the \\"feel\\" of this book and the quality of the cover art impressed me.  The cover itself did much to set the mood for the adventure that awaited me on the inside of this book.  From the very first word to the last, I could see that Mr. McCann has polished his craft to a point that every word, character and plot work in unison to tell an impressive story as well. The writing is devoid of errors and the dialogue between the characters has been laid out quite well.<br />Although there are many characters in this story that can carry a book on their own, the main character; Marcus the Avenger, is an interesting hero.  Marcus witnessed his village's apparent demise at the hands of a race of bloodthirsty warriors called the Krim `Tiak.  He spent over a year in seclusion until he is captured in the \\"City of Gods\\" and promptly sentenced to death for the crime of stealing bread.  Fortunately Princess Kimbra spares his life in exchange for him becoming a protégé, trained to fight others for the amusement of the masses.  Marcus the Avenger, renamed himself Forest when he joined the Hauldinian society as a \\"gladiator\\", bound to the \\"City of Gods\\"- until either killed or freed.<br />Everyone is equally impressed by Forest's unique fighting style, reminiscent of Ninjitsu with the nunchuka as his primary weapon.  This \\"vagabond\\" intrigues the princess and Forest quickly achieves the trust of his \\"mentor\\" Sir Theomund, the princess's bodyguard.  Forest had again found a \\"home\\" until he receives word from his village that there may still be hope for triumph over the Krim `Tiak attackers.  Sir Theomund risks his life and rank and allows Forest to return to his people with a promise to return.  The princess hides her identity and sets off into the harsh world in search of adventure, with Forest in the lead, who is unaware that he has taken a princess from her kingdom.<br />At the same time in different parts of the land, other adventures have begun.  A wizard and a group of  \\"misfits\\" of various races, a wild-man and his trusted steed, a former Krim `Tiak warrior in search of redemption - there are so many characters that are vital to this story and they all held my interest - especially when their separate paths merged into a single mission.<br />I must applaud Mr. McCann for the effort that he has put into \\" Upon the Shoulders of Vengeance: The Journey to Armageddon\\".  I recommend that you pick up a copy and take your own personal journey into these pages.  As I've said before, this book is indeed a work of art - inside and out!	2003-12-01

A student of Henry Miller, Castaneda, Gurdjieff, and Krishnmurti for over forty years, Mr. Daley has written, \\"Tasting the White Water\\" as both a biography as well as an inspirational story.  Like many of us, Mr. Daley takes part in many of the same struggles that we face today.  He has a family and the normal obligations that we are all charged with.  However, Mr. Daley feels that something is missing and that he has not reached his full potential.  He documents his dreams in this book and tries to attach some type of value to them during the course of his day.  At times he is overcome by a feeling that he has lost control and that he is not prepared, as his dreams switch from one scene to another.  There are so many parts of his inner-self that crave attention as well as outside factors that need to be addressed.<br />He and his friend Alex take up white water rafting in this stage of his life as a means of recapturing their youth and they discover a natural and legal high.  At first, they feel their way down the rapids with little skill and some success.  However, as the book progresses Mr. Daley conquers his fears and insecurities as he battles fearlessly through the rapids, and he begins to awaken from his life and reach towards his true potential.  It is as if the worries of his life have vanished to be replaced by a true appreciation of life itself.  Time has stopped, material things began to sloth away as every beam of sunlight and every part of God's creation teaches Mr. Daley about his inner-self and how he has evolved based on his experiences and dreams. <br /> He acknowledges the fact that we are who we make ourselves to be.  Nothing in life is totally out of control, as it is perceived.  If you tackle a series of problems in the same manner that you tackle the powerful current as you navigate through vicious rapids, you can achieve success.  Sometimes you have to \\"roll with the punches\\" and prepare yourself physically and mentally for the unpredictables that fate and destiny assign to us.  Perhaps that was not his entire message, but Mr. Daley's inspiration has awakened a part of my psyche to believe that this is what it means to me.  I had some trouble placing the genre primarily because this book can mean so many positive things in so many ways.<br />The imagery is vivid and you may find yourself gasping or holding your breath as you ride the rapids with Mr. Daley.  He is a true artist well verse in the use of words and descriptions to take you to the places that he has been and to travel down the river that he has conquered. \\"Tasting the White Water\\" is a remarkable piece of literature free from any \\"fluff\\" or unnecessaries.  Every word in this book and every scenario offered ties into his central theme that man is still truly asleep in his potential.  To awaken we must first realize that we are asleep and then we are prepared to take the next step.	2003-11-12

Imagine also that in that place young children are martyred - in exchange for a \\"handsome cash bonus, guaranteed, within 10 business days of the event.\\"  Imagine now a place where the sound of a blaring siren fills the air as the inhabitants of that place drop to their knees and chant in the direction of a place perceived as \\"the Holy Land.\\"  Now I must ask you to imagine that this place is - the United States of America!<br />This is a story primarily about two peoples, the inhabitants of Kennewick, Washington and the Minervans.  The Kennewickians are earthlings that simply reside in or come from Kennewick and the Minervans are \\"refugees\\" from a distant planet who claim that Kennewick is their ancient homeland - and they want it back!<br />In this struggle, both sides are equally repulsive in many ways to each other.  The Politicians from the United States, who are driven by greed and media image, cannot defeat the Minervans through forceful military means, mainly because the Minervans are telepaths and are well aware of the soldiers thoughts as they engage in combat.   Therefore they use the Kennewickians as pawns in this despicable \\"chess game\\".    The American politicians send the Kennewickians off to a refugee camp to make the Minervans feel remorse for what they are doing.  They also send in children as martyrs, again to make the Minervans feel bad.<br /> The Minervans hail from the Central Galactic Empire - which is part of a conglomerate of planets organized to monitor and sometimes regulate the activities of their subjects, with the liberal Western Galactic Empire in the lead role. The Western Galactic Empire, although they are technically advanced and able to control the thoughts and actions of the Kennewickians, ultimately controls the Minervans.  They too become pawns in this battle for Kennewick.<br />As the two political battles are waged, enter our two main characters.  Sergeant Andrew Hamilton, a POW from a failed attempt to defeat the Minervans and Priestess 3rd Class Aurora, she is the Minervan who captured this Army Ranger to keep as a \\"study specimen\\" with the hopes of making him \\"human\\".<br />Can these two individuals stop the decay that threatens the galaxy?  Well, the ending will definitely surprise you and the journey from the first page to the last will be enjoyable.  This book captivated me and took my thought process to a higher level.  Robert Zubrin's book should find a place at the top of your \\"Must Read\\" list.  Written in a way that can satisfy a multitude of genres, target audiences and age groups, \\"The Holy Land\\" has something for every one.	2003-11-11

Jason Powers shares with us his journey down the path of righteousness.<br />Jason Powers is a true man of GOD with the desire to share with us his true story of faith.  Jason heard the call of the LORD and began a journey spanning hundreds of miles across the country to find and follow his spiritual father. Many of us may be a bit apprehensive and overcome by self-doubt as we hear the voice of GOD giving us direction.  Jason heard the voice during dreams and waking hours and dedicated his life to becoming a faithful and humble servant of the LORD.<br />As I turned the pages of his book, I could sense that I was also turning a page in the author's life. Mr. Powers is well verse in the bible and has a talent for translating the word into understandable terms and then applying those terms to his actions.  Jason Powers has given his life to the LORD, he trusted that he would be given enough direction to move towards his destiny, and with each step, he moved closer to a higher understanding.  The only reward he envisioned was a better understanding of his relationship with GOD and the ability to spread the word to others who desire the same peace in their lives.<br />It was a true honor to read &quot;A Servant's Heart: Finding Your Spiritual Father&quot;.  Jason Powers has found peace in serving the LORD with a pure and untainted faith.<br />If you seek to understand the LORD and increase your faith in GOD, I highly recommend that you purchase this book and read the work of a man who has witnessed and learned the path to salvation.  Jason Powers has been anointed by GOD and is a faithful messenger that will truly inspire.	2003-10-21

Book Review<BR>The Carrot And The Mule<BR>By: Joseph Anthony Foti<br />Reviewed by: Betsie of Betsie's Literary Page<br />Highly Recommended<br />5 out of 5 points!<br />I Could Not Put This Book Down!<br />There have been many times where we have placed others on such a high pedestal that we fail to see who they really are.  We risk anything and everything to make that special person \\"happy\\" in exchange for their promise of fidelity and loyalty. Mr. Foti's main character, Roger Williams, did just that.<br />Roger came from a troubled household where his father constantly abused him, as his mother pretended that she was the matron of a happy home and allowed the horrible abuse to take place.  At an early age, Roger's grandmother took him in and raised him for four years prior to her own death.  After her passing, Roger was again thrust back into that destructive environment that his parents provided and worked hard to escape.  Roger left that household and entered a world in which no one was to be trusted - until he met Sara, the love of his life and also the product of a dysfunctional family.<br />Sara was Roger's anchor and the source of the inner-peace that allowed him to move past his troubled childhood.  Roger placed all of his trust and faith in this one woman; she was his reason for living.  Slowly, Roger was pulled into Sara's world of questionable friends.  She refused to abandon them regardless of the broken promises and countless times that they betrayed her. However, Roger stayed by her side far longer than most would even fathom, with the hope that they will be together forever. Sara was the \\"Carrot\\" that pushed Roger forward, forever reaching for the ultimate prize to be found with her love.<br />Brilliantly written with a plot and dialogue that will intrigue you from beginning to end.  Once I read the first word of this book and the first scene unfolded, I instantly knew that this would be a winner! <br />I highly recommend that you read Mr. Foti's book and explore the darker side of the fairy tale that we call love. Find out if the trust that Roger placed in Sara was well placed.	2003-10-08
