Its overall tone is melancholy. Why would this godly man be so sad? He had everything: wealth, success, wisdom - one would think he would be the perfect picture of a happy man. Yet, reading these verses would tell us otherwise.<br /><br />Dr. David Jeremiah, senior pastor of Shadow Mountain Community Church in El Cajon, California, takes us deep into this book that contains so many lessons of life. He shows us Solomon's human-ness and deals with the hard questions, such as: Why is life so frustrating? Will I ever attain happiness? Is it too late for me? Or, as Dr. Jeremiah puts it: \\"Where can I find a little heaven on earth?\\"<br /><br />This is a thirty-one-day study into Ecclesiastes-thirty-one chapters asking and attempting to answer some of life's most difficult questions-for today. Solomon wasn't much different from any of the rest of us. I'm sure you remember this one `famous' verse: \\"Vanity of vanities [...] all is vanity.\\" (Ec. 1:2) Solomon looked back on all he had and had done, and came to the conclusion that it was all vanity - \\"...no profit under the sun.\\" (Ec. 2:11.)<br /><br />Dr. Jeremiah gives some excellent and timely examples of this very feeling throughout the book. Chapters titled: \\"Bored to Death;\\" \\"Trivial Pursuits;\\" \\"When Justice Isn't Just;\\" \\"Employment without Enjoyment;\\" \\"Life Cheats!\\" and \\"Life is Short: Enjoy It\\" to name just a few.<br /><br />The wonderful and well-known words of Ecclesiastes Chapter 3 - \\"To everything there is a season, A time for every purpose under heaven: A time to be born, And a time to die...\\" is dealt with in Chapter 5: Impressions About Life. This is excellent.<br /><br />The whole book is excellent, and very well done. I really enjoyed looking into the inner thoughts and explanations of Solomon as they apply to our lives today. This is one of those books I label \\"a keeper.\\"<br /><br />It also comes with an accompanying journal, ISBN 1-59145-221-X. Now I don't journal, so I wasn't sure I'd be able to use this extra book that is available. But I found it to be a wonderful, perhaps even necessary, tool to use side-by-side with the book itself.<br /><br />Yes, I can highly recommend these books.I don't journal, so I wasn't sure I'd be able to use this extra book that is available.

So, this little section gives some nice suggestions for inclusion into the lunch box, and a little note example that reads:<br /><br />\\"Wish I could have been more help with your math homework last night. We didn't learn it that way in the good old days. Be sure to ask your teacher for a little extra help if you still need it. Remember 1+1+1+1= (Dad+Mom+Sis+you) = our family and it's the perfect answer!\\"<br /><br />That's just one small taste of all that is offered. There is another chapter in which the author mentions \\"Colorful Love Notes and Lunchboxes\\" For a \\"Red Lunch\\" pack the lunchbox with a pizza slice with tomato sauce; radishes; a red Delicious Apple and red licorice stick. An \\"Orange Lunch\\" would include a sandwich with American cheese, carrots, cheese curls and orange slices.<br /><br />The last pages of the book contain templates in different shapes, sizes and designs you can trace or photocopy, cut out, and personalize for your own special notes.<br /><br />All in all, this book has a lot of good stuff. And, when you get right down to it, you don't need to be confined to just kids. Many husbands take lunches to work, too.

Ballymara's tourism depends on the romance of the local legend, and Moyra meets this threatening challenge by digging deep into the past to uncover the roots of the legend. Not only does she have to prove the legend is authentic, but Moyra finds herself praying that the pledging stone can work its magic one more time-for her.<br /><br />A Legend of Peace: Vickie McDonough<br /><br />Ballymara, 1895: Jilted and hurt by an American cowboy, Keely O'Cullen has her defenses up when yet another one comes into her life.

She runs into immediate flack when she approaches Brendan Flanagan, single, handsome pastor of the church where the wedding is to take place. Claire needs Brendan's cooperation in getting the wedding exactly the way Claire has envisioned it.<br /><br />Brendan, on the other hand, doesn't believe this huge wedding is what the groom, Brendan's own cousin, really wants. Brendan's abrasive `know-it-all' attitude irks Claire, and their independent and strong personalities clash instantly. First is that he is a pastor and Claire wants nothing to do with religion. In fact, if she didn't need the church for the wedding plans, she would never put foot inside to begin with.<br /><br />But, she does need to get Brendan on her side, so they strike a reluctant, uneasy bargain: Brendan will help with the wedding if Claire will help him with a questionable group of teens that he has meeting-unsanctioned-at the church. This is another thorn in Claire's side. She has no experience with teens, except when she had been one. Now, Brendan expects her to mentor these rowdies - namely, to teach them how to present themselves to potential employers and help prepare them for a respectable and productive future.<br /><br />These are all the ingredients for a romance strewn with problems, misunderstandings, mischief and faith. As Claire works with the kids she realizes she is actually enjoying herself. Brendan is drawn to Claire, but holds back because she is not a believer. Claire cannot deny her attraction to him but there is this God-thing she can't quite get into. both are wary and hold back their attraction, stifling their emotions and feelings for each other.<br /><br />UNLIKELY HERO is another good read from Steeple Hill and author Marta Perry.

Nowhere is the truth of this more evident than in the life of Jamie D. Lane, handsome, rich, talented and idolized pop star.<br /><br />The premise is not new: rich boy wants to see what life is like where nobody knows who he is. Usually these escapes are planned with the cooperation of at least one other person. But Jamie, while taking a break to tend to some personal matters, comes across some things that nudge him to try to go back to his roots. And he does.<br /><br />There is no one in the world who knows where he's gone. He changes his appearance, cuts and dyes his hair, adds colored contacts, everything he can think of so he won't be recognized, and heads up to the Pacific Northwest-alone, and becomes Joe Bradley.<br /><br />Jamie's self-imposed exile reveals more than he had originally intended to learn. He takes a minimum-wage job making donuts, lives with a group of Trappist monks and drives an old second-hand car, accompanied by a lovable pan-handling dog.<br /><br />Anne Stewart, once a teacher of inner-city kids and former high-school track star, now lives in a caboose-turned-apartment behind her parent's donut shop. She is filled with harsh bitterness and hatred against the drunk driver who nearly ended her life. Now she works at a small Christian school as part-time teacher, despite her physical and mental limitations. When Joe Bradley volunteers to help her with the school musical production of Bye Bye Birdie, Anne's life takes an unexpected turn.<br /><br />Joe Bradley aka Jamie D. Lane, is pulled into the life of the people of this small town. He actually enjoys making donuts, and finds strange comfort at the abbey with the monks. And, he discovers an irresistible urge to \\"help\\" - giving anonymously. The more he gives, the greater the risk of exposure. Working with Anne and the musical only increases his chance of discovery. But the real danger is that Joe/Jamie is starting to believe his own lies and deceits.<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book. Robert Elmer writes with such wit that you'll find yourself laughing out loud, and then he turns around and hits you with a zinger that brings real tears. The personal and spiritual journey of both Jamie and Anne is deep, and real. You will love them, laugh with them, and weep with them, but you will cheer them on.

Just ask Betsy Blessing and she'll emphatically agree. But Betsy faces a particularly difficult situation-she's an ordained minister. Not only that, she's assistant pastor at Church of the Shepherd, an old church of mostly old folks and governed by a group of crusty and cantankerous board members.<br /><br />Betsy is also single. And of course she is subjected to the match-making efforts of her friends. On the other hand, after suffering through these impossible \\"dates\\" one wonders if her friends aren't enemies in disguise.<br /><br />The real fun starts when Betsy must step in to fill the pulpit for the ailing senior minister. Now she has all the responsibilities of being senior minister, but none of the respect that goes along with it. A leaking baptistery, money disappearing from the collection box, and disapproval of her association with David Swenson, pastor of a \\"rival\\" church, will keep you totally entertained.<br /><br />When her best friend decides Betsy needs a make-over, televised for the whole world to see, the results are disastrously hysterical. Her congregation does not approve of the `new' Betsy. You'll laugh out loud as you follow Betsy through the struggle not only with her congregation, but with herself. She deals with a past she's not proud of, her awakening feelings for David, who up to now has just been a friend and sparring partner, and her relationship with God.<br /><br />You'll love Betsy - she's delightfully human, and this is a fun romp through the life of a lady preacher who finally comes to terms with who she really is. And the author, Beth Pattillo, is herself an ordained minister, which lends credibility to this brisk, fast-paced read.<br /><br />Peggy Phifer ©2005	2005-09-26

Who are they and why were they killed? Annie's usual work is to draw composite sketches of a suspect as described by the victim or a witness. This time, her abilities are put to the test when she is called upon to draw pictures of these victims as they must have looked while alive in order to identify them . . . because their features bear no resemblance to anything normal.<br /><br />When the sixth corpse is discovered virtually in Annie's back yard, it becomes personal. Fear and dread come to live in the Kingston home. As Annie works with the local and county officials, the pressure increases. The reality of the dead women is horrible enough, but when it looks like Annie herself has become a target of the killer, the stakes rise.<br /><br />There is a serial killer out there and the sky park community of Grove Landing is in an uproar. The citizens are furious, demanding action - and terrified. Who is it? Who can they trust? How can they protect themselves? Who will be the next victim?<br /><br />As the tension mounts, Annie depends more and more on prayer-desperate at times. Can she remain faithful through all this? As if she didn't have enough pressure with the drawings and the reality of the horrible killings, she must contend with her juvenile delinquent teen-age son, and a sensitive, vulnerable young daughter.<br /><br />It is difficult to write a review of Brandilyn Collins' work without giving anything away. What I've written so far is an attempt to tease you and pull you in. This lady is, to my mind, one of the most talented writers of suspense today. Dead of Night is book three in the Hidden Faces Series. And I think it is better than book two (Stain of Guilt), which was better than book one (Brink of Death). But that's not fair, either. The best part of all is that these books show how Annie Kingston grows through her experiences. She finds her way to a belief and faith in the One Who is Always There.<br /><br />If you like spine-tingling, hair-raising, edge-of-the-seat suspense, you've got to read these books.

When she decides to check on the well-being of her nephew, the son of her estranged late step-sister, she not only uses the camera as a prop to keep things from getting too personal, she arrives at the Flanagan home and into their lives under false pretenses.<br /><br />Julie uses the half-pretense of a photo story on fire-fighters to insinuate herself into the lives of the Flanagan family. She uses her camera and cover story to get close to Seth Flanagan, father of three-year-old Davy, her sister's child. She hadn't planned on falling in love with her pint-sized nephew, nor did she count on the attraction that grows between herself and Seth. And Seth, still grieving over the loss of his wife, tries to fight the pull of Julie's presence.<br /><br />Julie, coming from a disturbing, unloving family background, is unprepared for the over-flowing warmth and open arms of the sprawling, rambunctious Flanagans. Still, she feels certain that Seth, working in a dangerous occupation can't possibly provide the safety and security she believes Davy needs. Determined to be objective about what she observes, she continues to protect herself from the ever-increasing pull of the unconditional love offered by the Flanagans.<br /><br />What happens when they discover Julie's deceit, and the subsequent dangers imposed on everyone when Julie's controlling father learns about the boy will keep you totally immersed in HERO DAD. Can God's love bring these two together? Can they sort through the hurt and deceit caused by Julie's lie? Both Julie and Seth must come to terms with their own feelings of guilt over the death of Lisa, Julie's dead step-sister, Seth's wife.<br /><br />You will love the Flanagans and find yourself wishing for more. And there IS more. Other titles by Marta Perry and the Flanagans are: HERO IN HER HEART, and UNLIKELY HERO.	2005-09-26

In the weeks following the battle of Breed's Hill, Elizabeth Howard is preparing for her marriage to the dashing Jonathan Carleton. But their future together is in doubt when General George Washington summons them both to a private meeting.<br /><br />The American struggle for freedom has just begun and both Beth and Jonathan are fully committed to doing their part in the war for independence from British tyranny. Beth's part is a pretext of Tory sympathizer while in truth she is a resourceful and valuable spy for Washington and the Patriot cause. Jonathan, once a British officer and now a General himself directly under Washington,  and with a price on his head, has skills that will send him far away from Boston and Beth. It will also remove him from the risk of capture and certain death at the hands of the British.<br /><br />So their wedding plans are put aside while each set out to carry out the mission Washington has assigned each of them. Beth's is to continue with her role in Boston, and ultimately New York Loyalist society, to learn what she can of the plans of the British.  Jonathan is sent first to Fort Ticonderoga, and from there to enlist the support of the Indian tribes for the American cause, or at the very least persuade them to remain neutral and not aid the British. But he falls into the hands of a hostile tribe and that is the last Beth hears of him.<br /><br />As the months pass in silence, Beth wonders if he is even alive. Should she begin to consider a life without him? And as Jonathan is taken farther and farther away from Beth he fears he will never see her again. How can he go back to her while the war still rages? The British want him dead, and his new life with the Indians has even made him an enemy of his own countrymen. Is their Christian faith and trust in God strong enough to see them through?<br /><br />Native Son is an intensely moving story, impeccably researched and excellently written. It is an intricate look into some aspects of the birth of our nation and the struggles and temptations faced by two unforgettable characters. J. M. Hochstetler expertly weaves a tale of historical fiction with a romance that must survive the trials and dangers of the times.<br /><br />While there are references to events and personalities introduced in Daughter of Liberty, book one in the series, Native Son easily stands alone.

An extra-marital affair and then lying to cover it up just about drove her over the edge. When she comes face-to-face with God and realizes that she has to set things straight, she begins a long and painful journey to Grace and Forgiveness.<br /><br />If' you're looking for titillating details and salacious tidbits, you'll be disappointed. You won't find them here. Instead you'll read an honest and soul-baring account written by a woman redeemed. You'll read of a life ridden with guilt, hurt, anger and fear, told openly yet private things are kept where they belong - private.<br /><br />If you know Sandi's story, perhaps you can appreciate what it took for her to write this book. She holds back nothing, blames no one but herself for the poor choices she made. What happened in her life has forever scarred her career and her family. But God does forgive, and Sandi's story as presented here proves that our God is a God of second chances.<br /><br />Broken on the Back Row, A Journey through Grace and Forgiveness with a forward by Max Lucado, is a very personal yet open book of confession, forgiveness and redemption.<br /><br />Peggy Phifer ©2005	2005-09-26

This is \\"not your average reference book\\" - to quote the press release I received when asked to review this book. Always up to a challenge, my curiosity piqued, I requested the book, and I'm not at all disappointed. Let's change that \\"D\\" word to \\"delighted!\\"<br /><br />I love reference books, encyclopedias, dictionaries, and the like, especially when it deals with any part of history. Biblical history is a particular fascination. When I had this new book in my hands I was captivated.<br /><br />\\"An illustrated A-to-Z Dictionary of the People and Places in Scripture\\" it says on the lower part of the cover. I thumbed it open and the book opened about mid-way to \\"Jeremiah.\\" A blocked side-bar caught my attention: \\"Prophets Who Didn't Want the Job\\" and yes, Jeremiah was certainly one, along with Moses and Jonah.<br /><br />This fantastic book is illustrated in full color, with artist's interpretations of things like Noah's Ark, Herod's Temple, Lot's family fleeing Sodom, and an intriguing rendition of Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar when he lost his mind and ate grass. Included are photos of modern day Israel and the way these historic places look today. And of course maps of all kinds.<br /><br />This isn't your normal dry, historical narrative interspersed with pictures and maps-the author shows his wit and humor with some wry and acerbic references such as the section about Solomon. Page 356 gives us this: \\"Solomon at his dumbest.\\" What? Everyone knows that Solomon was the wisest man in the Bible. So what's this?

In book two of Ahab's Legacy, we once again meet Hannah Rose, widow of the notorious Captain Ahab. Left with a son to raise alone, Hannah has fled Nantucket and the bittersweet memories of her marriage to Ahab, and to protect her son from the angry people whose lives were destroyed by Ahab's insane rage against a white, rogue whale.<br /><br />Hiding her true identity from all but a select few, Hannah leaves her refuge at her cousin's home in Indiana to visit dear friends in Boston, after which she and Timothy fulfill her life-long dream to travel - see the world.<br /><br />But things don't turn out quite the way she planned. While in Boston, Hannah finds herself involved with the mission work conducted by Jeremiah Harris, a former suitor, and his wife Kerenhappuch, both now dear friends and steadfast Christians. The work severely challenges Hannah, who finds it both rewarding and conflicting. She had long since given up on prayer. It had availed her nothing when she trusted God to take care of Ahab. Now, she trusted only herself.<br /><br />As she reluctantly takes on some work that Kerenhappuch can no longer handle, Hannah comes face to face with a life she never dreamed existed. She does things she never imagined she'd be willing to do, and finds a slow-dawning gratification through her efforts. Then her oldest and dearest friend gets Hannah involved with the Abolitionists and helping escaped slaves from the pre-Civil War South.<br /><br />Her life becomes even more interesting when she meets two handsome and charming men, though their life-styles and attitudes are diametrically opposed: a dashing, naval captain and slave-owner from Virginia, and the strong, steadfast captain who knows who Hannah really is.<br /><br />Tensions mount as her son Timothy gets older and shows more and more that he is Ahab's son. How can she protect him from his own inherited nature and the truth about his father? More importantly, will Hannah realize God's plans for her as she sees the deep faith and sacrifice of her friends? Can she learn to trust Him again?<br /><br />HANNAH ROSE is one of those books that is close to impossible to put down. Rich with the history of nineteenth century Boston, you are skillfully drawn into the era and the lives of the people that lived during that time. This is good reading, great history and excellent writing. Louise Gouge has earned all the praise I can give this book.

There are dozens, if not hundreds, of devotional writings out there, from the periodicals such as Upper Room, to full-size books for everyone from dieters to caregivers and general books such as Daily Guideposts. We all have one or two, or an assortment. But Writer's in the Spirit is, I believe, the first one specifically for writers. And it is excellent.<br /><br />Sally Stuart (Christian Writer's Market Guide) wrote: \\"Writers in the Spirit helps connect me to God while reminding me that writing is a gift from Him and a calling to be both treasured and nurtured.\\" This reviewer agrees. Reading this book has been a unique experience and a book I will probably reread over time.<br /><br />Carol Rottman writes with a fresh voice, providing inspiration and introspection with each paragraph. In places, the book reads like a journal, revealing discoveries about herself and her writing journey. Chapters are written as mini-essays and never fail to drive home a point to the reader. Doesn't matter what type of writing you do, there is something here that is bound to bless, encourage, inspire, and even admonish.<br /><br />The book is divided into eleven topical sections such as \\"Nourishment,\\" \\"Understanding,\\" \\"Realism,\\" and \\"Creation.\\" No, that last is not about God's creation - the sub-caption says \\"Writing is creating. No writer writes like anyone else; each voice is unique.\\" Each of these topical sections consists of several short essays that delve into the topic, followed by tips, hints and advice, and a writing challenge.<br /><br />Says Rottman: \\"Writing for me is a form of meditation. I love the discipline of writing everyday using the ever-changing experiences in my life. I've discovered that God has equipped many of us with a desire to share our understanding of life through the written word. I agree with Jerry Jenkins, who once said, `I don't sing or dance or preach. I have been given one gift, so I feel obligated to exercise it in the work of the kingdom.'

Who can resist a tale of King Arthur, Guenevere, and the Knights of the Round Table? Fact, myth, legend...what? It continues to fascinate.<br /><br />But this story is different. Now, Arthur and Guenevere are both dead, Merlin has vanished, and Camelot is no more. Still, the knights live on, and we meet Lancelot Percival, Galahad and others as they plan to restore the rightful Arthurian heir and rid the Isle of Might of its evil servants.<br /><br />Emerald Rose Rayn is this heir. Legitimate daughter of Arthur and Guenevere, Rayn was raised by Lancelot and is now a beautiful young woman of sixteen years. She does not know of her royal heritage, and believes herself the daughter of Lancelot. Trained as a warrior, tutored by Merlin, she has a solid and steadfast faith and belief in God.<br /><br />Young Shadoe un Hollo Tors, son of Merlin, having once run away in anger at his father's betrayal, has wandered the world pursuing his own pleasures. When a dream in which he is told he must help appoint Arthur's rightful heir to the throne, Shadoe reluctantly goes back to his island home. Shadoe turned his back on God at the same time he abandoned Camelot, and his bitterness keeps him at war with what he as been sent to do. He is determined to see it through but once done he will leave forever.<br /><br />Rayn has other ideas. She believes Shadoe is her \\"godsend\\" - the man promised to her by God. Shadoe resists. Though sharing a mutual dislike and distrust of one another, attraction lies under the surface and sparks are never far from igniting. Yet, because of his promise, Shadoe can't avoid being drawn into the plans of Rayn and the Knights to restore Camelot to its former glory and save the isle.<br /><br />Morgause le Fey, sorceress and half-sister of Arthur, has her own plans - to put her son Mordred, illegitimate son of Arthur, on the throne and capture the Isle of Might at all costs. Mordred is weak and becomes nothing more than a puppet being manipulated by Morgause's unspeakable evil. No one on the Isle of Might is safe from her relentless scheming and ruthless ambition.<br /><br />What a fun, and heart-stopping read of the battle between good and evil. As we watch the love develop between Rayn and Shadoe-will they ever accept it might be their destiny?-and pray with the Knights as they lay their plans, we know that whatever they do will be countered by Morgause's sorcery and demons.<br /><br />This is Linda Wichman's first novel, but it won't be her last! Legend of the Emerald Rose is masterfully woven with all the skillful elements of good story-telling. You can almost believe you're right back there in that ancient time; it's for sure you'll feel the goose-flesh rise when Morgause turns up, knowing something awful is going to happen. And only Rayn, Arthur's rightful heir, can end the violence and restore peace and order. But at what price?<br /><br />This is a `gotta read' and I say run, don't walk, to your nearest Christian bookstore and get this book. Young and old will enjoy it for the era it evokes and the richness of the writing.<br /><br />Peggy Phifer @2005s unspeakable evil.

He is to be trained to become \\"laird of the clan,\\" a position Keifer doesn't want, but that someone else is determined he shall not have-at any cost.<br /><br />Nola, the feisty and irrepressible daughter of Adam and Gwyneth, has made up her mind she will be a part of Keifer's future. In fact, she is certain of it, even though Keifer is apparently unaware of her other than as a playmate, companion and general pest. When it is time for Keifer to leave to continue his training to become a knight, Nola forces him to make a promise that may prove difficult, if not impossible, for either of them to fulfill.<br /><br />Bitter at the twist of fate that deprived him of his father when still a child, Keifer resents even the offered help of those who are in a position to mentor him. Still, he has vowed to serve his king, Robert the Bruce, in Scotland's struggle for freedom from English tyranny. Keifer's bitterness deepens when he is betrayed by those he thought he could trust. Can he even be sure his own clan members are not among those counted as enemies? Finally, grievously wounded, he spurns the help of those who love him, including Nola. And what of their promise to each other-will he throw that away, too?<br /><br />Peace with England is the cause and the hope of Robert the Bruce and the knights that fight alongside him. But for Keifer McNab, there is another war raging deep within. Is he willing to pay the price for this peace even if it should mean dying? Can he let go of his bitterness to find the faith he'll need to continue? Can he accept the unconditional love offered?<br /><br />THE PROMISE OF PEACE is the fourth and final book in the Scottish Crown Series. These books have been of special interest to me because this is my own heritage. And I have always loved to read about the early and tragic struggles of the Scots.

Yet this perfect marriage is threatened when his mother is stricken with a debilitating disease and he sees her life ebbing away. Dale doesn't believe that kind of love will ever happen to him, and he's not sure he wanted it anyway. Love brings pain. So, he determined he will never be a husband much less a father. Kids make him -- uncomfortable.<br /><br />Bev, too, is afraid to love again. Her life is moving along quite well, thank you very much. She is doing just fine raising Michael and four-year-old Kristin alone. She doesn't need anyone else interfering with things and messing up her life.

Who can be trusted? These are questions CIA agent Dub Minden had to ask, even of the close-knit group he'd worked with for years. What was going on? Losing this last agent meant The Agency's project in the Caribbean was about to die with him unless they could insert another man-and soon. And Dub knew just the man-one who was already dead.<br /><br />Mark Daniel, shot down in Thailand and presumed dead, fit the bill perfectly for the Caribbean project for reasons known only to Dub. Complicated and `need-to-know' steps were taken to protect Mark's identity and get him into the region. Code name: Lazarus. Appropriately named, but would it work?<br /><br />Medellin, Columbia, 1977. After two years, Mark Daniel, now known as Carlos Ortiz, freelance pilot for sale to the highest bidder, has made contact with one of the drug warlords to smoke out the leaders of a huge drug ring the Agency has been trying to put out of business for years--the same cartel that had managed to ferret out and kill the previous agents planted in their midst before Mark. Only Dub Minden and one other know Mark's real identity and where he is.<br /><br />Carlos plays a dangerous game which becomes even more so when he is sky-jacked at gun-point and forced to fly into Bogota to rescue the lovely Sol Agueda de Roca from a kidnapping attempt. Because of this flight, Carlos misses a crucial appointment with Paolo Guzman, a dangerous man Carlos hopes will put him in touch with the next man up the line. Can he explain and still meet the contact he needs? Can he even stay alive?<br /><br />When Sol de Roca becomes the victim of an assassination attempt and Carlos is once again drawn into their lives, things heat up at a rapid pace and soon we find Sol and Carlos running for their lives in the mountains of Columbia.<br /><br />THE LAZARUS FILE has some unexpected twists and turns that make you turn the pages, though it does get bogged down from time to time.

In this day of increasing stress, responsibilities and pressure - both from outside and what we do to ourselves - we all know of or have heard of the appalling incidents of \\"road rage\\" occurring almost every day all across the country. Why?<br /><br />Debra Wiebe, in a fit of anger, charges out of her house, gets behind the wheel of her car and tears out onto the streets - a lethal weapon on the loose. As her anger surges, something snaps, and a young man - a total stranger - loses his life. Witnesses at the scene, who saw it happen, insist it was deliberate. Of course, Debra is arrested, charged with first-degree murder, and jailed - without bail. Debra doesn't remember anything. She can't believe she could have killed anyone - let alone in the cold-blooded way they tell her it happened.<br /><br />Debra's husband, Jerry, hires defense attorney Marcia Dixon. As Marcia begins her investigation into what happened, and spending time with Debra, she sees the explosive nature of Debra's anger-unpredictable and violent. What could possibly cause that kind of rage? It is Marcia's job to find out. In order to defend her client, Marcia knows she has to do some serious digging.<br /><br />We journey with Debra, Jerry and Marcia through the judicial system. Debra, after her initial hearing, is ordered to spend thirty days of evaluation at a psychiatric facility. Marcia's hope is to be able to plead temporary insanity. But Debra proves a difficult client, her anger erupting, wildly uncontrolled and dangerous, despite her terror at the prospect of spending the rest of her life behind bars - or worse.<br /><br />I was captivated by this story. MIND TRAP is a gripping picture of what anger can do. So many of us have hidden pasts, buried trauma, unbearable hurt, dormant until something triggers an emotional upheaval that is beyond our control. Still, underlying and under-girding the Wiebe family is their faith in God, and the knowledge that, however difficult things become at times, He is with us, holding us up, loving us. Debra just has to be whacked upside the head to make her see it, too.<br /><br />As is often the case with so many self-published books, there are a number of editing problems with this one. There have been times when I've refused to review these books because they are too difficult to read, and I can't, in all conscience, review them or recommend them. HOWEVER - this one is an exception. Yes, the errors are there - annoying and distracting at times - but Debra's story grabbed me and I kept reading, doing my best to ignore those errors. And - though I'm no authority - I feel the author has done a lot of research into the subject.<br /><br />Ms. Derksen has written a powerful story - one I think has a great potential, properly edited and with a traditional publisher.

What happens when two diametrically opposed women are thrown into the den of an autistic but brilliant physics engineer? The fun starts when Dillon Richard, a man with zero experience with women finds both of these women interested in him. Rachel Meyers is an independent spirit, a biophysicist who has developed a quantum computer that could forever change the world. She is hired to work with Dillon to combine their talents to bring this computer to market.<br /><br />Keryn Wills writes mysteries. She is also part-time financial officer at CypherQuanta, the same company for which Dillon and Rachel are working. Problem is, Keryn finds herself in the unwanted position of competing against the quirky, vivacious Rachel for Dillon's attention. Yet, despite her increasing jealousy, Keryn's job is to keep Dillon and Rachel together, and focused, so they can finish the quantum computer, which their company is depending on for their financial future.<br /><br />However, it soon becomes apparent that their secret project has been discovered. Dillon's lab is vandalized. Grant O'Connell, their boss at CypherQuanta is acting uncharacteristically. As financial officer, Keryn knows their entire future depends on getting this project to market. Who has learned about the quantum computer? Before long, Keryn, Dillon and Rachel realize that not only is this project in jeopardy, but their lives very well may be in danger, too. And soon they are on the run. The thing is, they don't know who they are running from. And they don't know who they can trust. Not even the government.<br /><br />This is a fantastic read. I'm certainly no physicist, but no special education needed to enjoy this one. Randall Ingermanson, himself a physicist, has created an intricate puzzle and fitting the pieces together will keep you occupied to the very last. As the tension mounts, Ingermanson manages to inject some fun moments as we watch Dillon try to learn about women and understand his attraction to both Rachel and Keryn, for totally different reasons. The two are nothing alike.<br /><br />DOUBLE VISION had me turning the pages trying to find a good place to stop so I could go to sleep. Hard to find one.

Can't wait for the sequel	Take six women of various ages and diverse personalities, mix in a hidden past, a smoldering resentment, an unexpected houseguest with a shocking surprise, and a nosy reporter determined to get a story no matter what, and you have a recipe for a great read.<br /><br />Meet Evangeline, Vonnie, Lizzie, Donna, Goldie and Lisa Leann. These are the women of the Potluck Club, an exclusive group that meet once a month to pray for each other as well as others in their small community of Summit View, Colorado. Oh, yes -- their name tells you something else - each member brings a potluck dish to share.<br /><br />Shepherd and Everson have taken a most unique approach in this book. Each woman takes center stage in separate chapters, interspersed with the thoughts, curiosity and speculations of Clay Whitefield, ace reporter for the Gold Rush News. The women's chapters are preceded with a recipe card. But don't worry if you can't read it. Every recipe is fully printed out in the back of the book.<br /><br />When we're in each woman's point of view, we get an insiders peek at what makes them who they are. They reveal their hidden hurts, wants, ambitions, jealousies and secrets, and you'll love them, sympathize with them, hurt for them, and be angry right along with them. They are so very real - so human.<br /><br />Evangeline, spinster, or Evie, as she is known, seems to be the pivotal character, the central mover of the group. It is mostly her home where they meet, and the book itself begins and ends with her. Yet the other five women get equal exposure and you learn to know their innermost thoughts.<br /><br />As we get to know these women, we watch them grow within themselves, their relationship with each other and in their walk with God. When someone not of their group suddenly needs prayer and support, these ladies are right there with everything they've got. Each of the six is not the same person at the end as they were when we first meet them.<br /><br />It took me a chapter or two to get comfortable with the way this book was done, but I quickly adjusted and could barely put the book down after that. And now I can't wait for the sequel, due out sometime in Summer 2006 - Title: The Potluck Club: Trouble's Brewing!<br /><br />One last note: Graham Kerr, chef, TV personality & best-selling author, endorsed this book with: \\"A taste-filled, tasteful look at real life, its dreams, and its ultimate purpose.\\" Now, how can you go wrong?

Despite the title, this fast-paced, intense book has nothing to do with the air, airplanes or even the suggested topic akin to \\"road rage\\" that is getting so much attention these days. No, AIR RAGE, written by British author Sam Yarney will keep you perched on the edge of your seat and turning the pages in anticipation.<br /><br />Cyrus Anderson, British journalist, war correspondent and best-selling author, works as a high-profile Special Events Coordinator for PDE Network, the biggest TV Christian broadcasting operation the world has ever known. He gets assignments interviewing some of the most important people in the world and is often requested by these people, specifically, or there will be no interview.<br /><br />In this book we meet:<br /><br />Cyrus's wife, Liddy, a reluctant yet supportive accomplice who's temper can make Cyrus's life - and job - impossible, even life-threatening.<br /><br />Alain Saint-Clair, Cyrus's \\"soul brother\\" and once best of friends, but now on the opposite side of everything Cyrus believes in, and one of the richest men on the globe.<br /><br />Pierre Dumas, probably the most powerful man in the world, invisibly pulling the strings of many lives - a master puppeteer that arranges things his way for his own ends, with no regard for human life.<br /><br />William Pitt, President of the United States.<br /><br />Andy O'Farrell, a man pursued, haunted and in hiding.<br /><br />Zhang Fengshan, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and the President of the People's Republic of China.<br /><br />If that hasn't piqued your interest, then consider this. Some of the above characters are pulled into a web of intrigue masterminded by a few. Lives are endangered, some lost. Multi-millions, even billions of dollars are invested in an elaborate plot to destroy and conquer.<br /><br />Writing a review of this type of book is very difficult because I don't dare reveal any surprises. But I can say this: AIR RAGE is well worth a read if you love the suspense and intrigue of an international plot that involves human life and the constant battle of right over wrong. This is strong writing.<br /><br />AIR RAGE is the sequel to Sam's first book, NINETY DAYS. Many of the characters in the first book reappear here. But it easily stands alone, and Yarney does a great job of introducing the characters and past events so that you don't feel left out or `in the dark' about what's gone before. This is a whole new plot, new story, and a very good read. I highly recommend AIR RAGE.<br /><br />© Peggy Phifer, Editor, Wordsmith Writer.you love the suspense and intrigue of an international plot that involves human life and the constant battle of right over wrong.

Brent Murphy is coming home. After years away pursuing a career in journalism, Brent has a need to face his demons at home. Namely, his father, a stern man Brent never seemed able to please.<br /><br />Sister Henrietta Mullins, novice at St. Mary's Orphan Asylum, discovers the difference between childhood dreams and reality. As the days pass, her commitment to the Sisters of Charity, once embraced willingly, becomes harder to bear. Not to mention the Texas heat.<br /><br />Everett Maxwell, editor of the Courier, Galveston's local newspaper. Discouraged there was nothing happening, nothing newsworthy to write about, Everett will now do just about anything for a story.<br /><br />Emma Sanders, newly `capped' nurse, eagerly faces her first day on the job at the local hospital. She quickly becomes overwhelmed at the enormity of what each day brings.<br /><br />To the east, across the Gulf of Mexico, a deadly storm was brewing that would change these lives and Galveston forever.<br /><br />HURRICANE is a day-by-day count-down to the cataclysmic storm that all but wiped Galveston off the map. In the characters Janice Thompson introduces to us we see attitudes change, goals shift, and watch as selflessness takes hold and the determination to save just one life overcomes fear.<br /><br />Through despair, devastation and death, Ms. Thompson gives hope. Determined, dogged faith prevails over doubt and discouragement. And God's love and mercy shines through.<br /><br />A tremendous read. Janice Thompson, a native Texan, has done her research and put together a compelling fictional account of the most catastrophic natural event of the twentieth century in which 6000 lives were lost. I highly recommend this one.	2004-11-30

Forensic artist Annie Kingston faces another challenge - make a drawing of a person who committed a double murder twenty years before. Popular television show American Fugitive had chosen this case for an upcoming program. The elusive fugitive is Bill Bland.<br /><br />Caught in embezzlement, Bland, an accountant, had been summoned to the home of business owner Don Terell for a confrontation. Also in attendance were Don's son, Edwin, and Peter Dessinger, employee. But their plans went horribly wrong, leaving two men dead and Bland on the run.<br /><br />Now, Edwin Terell and his mother, Emily, approach Annie to do an aging drawing of how Bland would look now. Their hope is that the American Fugitive TV show, along with Annie's drawing, would flush out Bland so he could be put behind bars for the twenty-year-old crime, and their long nightmare would come to an end.<br /><br />In order to do the updated face of Bland, Annie needs to learn all she can about the man. She needs to get inside his skin - his mind. What makes him tick? How would certain mannerisms affect how he would appear today? She needs to almost become Bill Bland. As she works, tension mounts.<br /><br />Annie can't shake memories of the consequences after the drawing she did for the killer of her neighbor Lisa Willit a year ago. Her entire family had been placed in jeopardy, living in terror. Would history repeat itself if she worked on this new face? Wasn't it enough that she, a single mom, had to deal with a rebellious teen son hell-bent on self-destruction?<br /><br />When Annie feels ready to start her composite, things begin to happen. Threats. Phone calls. Her neighbor Dave Willit, and local police detective Ralph Chetterling promise help and protection. But how can they? The nightmare begins again. Annie and her family are once more placed in harm's way.<br /><br />Annie Kingston is in an internal struggle with - or against - God. She resists the pull she feels, convinced she can survive on her own. When caught in desperate situations beyond her control, she bargains with God: \\"Help me now and I'll seek you later.\\" Can she finally admit that she needs God? That she cannot do this alone?<br /><br />In STAIN OF GUILT, Brandilyn Collins has once again woven a sinister, complicated, tense story with twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

A young Iranian graduate student at the University of Tehran, on vacation, finds a curious wooden box floating in the waters of Lake Sevan, in Armenia. The discovery, when taken back to the professor of ancient artifacts, sets off a hunt for dating the strange box. How did it come to be where Jamal found it? And, though very old, it was proven that it had not been in the water long at all. Where did it come from?<br /><br />Now, let us go way back in time. Matter of fact, back thousands of years ago to the days of Noah, descendant of Seth, son of Adam and Eve. We meet Shem, the almost eighteen year old son of Noah, discontent with his farming family, yearning only for adventure. His dearest dream is to go \\"wandering\\" with his Uncle Zakho. Zakho had been all over the known world, and Shem wanted to see what his uncle had seen, even to persuade Zakho to go into the dangerous country to the north where Shem had heard dwelt mysterious peoples and strange, dangerous beasts. Noah reluctantly lets his son go off with his brother.<br /><br />After stopping for a few days visit with Lamech, Noah and Zakho's father, Shem manages to wear down his uncle into agreeing to head into the north country. Shem has heard tales about the Great Sea, and the city of Tuball, far to the north. As the two travel with their burdened donkeys, they are assaulted by a fierce dust storm, then snow as they reach the higher elevations. Shem, full of questions, bedevils his uncle to distraction, but they move on into new places, meet new, strange peoples with different gods and beliefs. Shem, being the son of Noah, who speaks with God, knows only of the One True God, and outspokenly challenges these other beliefs. His own faith never wavers, standing firm in his God.<br /><br />A severe mountain snowstorm separates Shem and Zakho. Shem, unaccustomed to the cold and not properly dressed, soon succumbs to the freezing temperatures, but is rescued by a lovely young woman named Kara, and her brother. As he heals, their attraction grows, but Shem is put off because of her gods. And Zakho, fearing his nephew is dead, finally gives up and continues on their intended journey to Tuball.<br /><br />TUBALL: The Lost City is a fascinating book to read. Because of the populated areas told about, I am assuming this was a time before the flood with which God destroyed the world. It was great fun to read what one author has envisioned about those days long ago. The Sethites, those descended from Seth, believed in the one, true God, talked to Him, worshipping only Him. Those of Cain, the slayer of Able, called Cainites, worshipped many gods. This greatly disturbed Shem, and his outspokenness often got him into some tightly dangerous situations. How God protected him throughout, no matter what he faced - even death - is wonderful reading.<br /><br />If you love historical fiction, especially ancient history, you'll enjoy this book.he heals, their attraction grows, but Shem is put off because of her gods.

In December of 1971, three boys, playing in their favorite cave, found a tiny casket containing the mummified body of a newborn baby girl. The plaque on the casket reads \\"Our Darling.\\"  Who was she and why was she buried in a cave?<br /><br />The time is 1924 - the \\"Roaring Twenties\\" -- in a place called Grand Junction, Colorado. In a small-town atmosphere, we meet high school senior Oak Miller and his family. Oak has dreams of becoming a successful reporter in New York City. Through his daily activities and observing things around him, Oak is constantly composing headline articles. His `idol' is fellow senior Dalton Trumbo, president of the graduating class and who also works part time for The Daily Sentinel.<br /><br />In the meantime, drama unfolds in Oaks world. Robert Miller, Oak's father, an embittered man who lost a leg in \\"The Great War\\" runs a bicycle shop. Hired man Evan Treece and his wife Margaret are expecting a baby. Oak's mother, Eulila, works at the Fair, a department store owned by William Moyer, a philanthropist who built a natatorium for the town to keep folks from drowning while trying to swim in the treacherous currents of the Gunnison River.<br /><br />We are there, with Oak Miller, in the daily life of a small town caught up in the carefree era of `flappers,' Model-T Fords and the slang of the day. Other folks in Oak's life are Art and Lillian Gesburg, part of Grand Junction's wealthy; Dugger Snyder, town bully, and the lovely Lazuli Waters, Oak's one and only love. But will she return his love?<br /><br />Debbie Brockett has a way of finding unusual story material. Once again, as in her previous book STAINED GLASS ROSE, it was a tour through a cemetery that piqued her interest after seeing a headstone that read:<br /><br />OUR DARLING<br /><br />FOUND IN A CAVE<br /><br />S.W.

Her task was made difficult because there seemed to be no record of the death of a baby girl in the approximate time period. Debbie's tenacity, frustrated at every turn, still put her in touch with some of the town's remaining citizen's who lived during the twenties.

New in town, twelve-year-old Dani Winters found it hard to make friends. So she is flattered and excited when a few kids purposely seek her out. She knows these new friends would not meet with her parents' approval and soon she is lying to her parents and sneaking out of her room to meet with them.<br /><br />The two girls Shy and Pepper, and two boys, M-Dog and Loco -- members of the Fifty-Fourth Street Pirates, skillfully stroke Dani's hunger for friends. They even give her a gang jacket and bestow on her the official nick-name of Dani-girl. But Dani is caught climbing back into her room one night and she is placed on restriction and her allowance cut off. Now she'll never get her video game out of lay-a-way.<br /><br />When Shy hands her fifty dollars to get that video game, Dani finds herself obligated. It doesn't take long before this group of 'friends' coerces her into doing something she really doesn't want to do - because she knows it's wrong. Yet, she DOES owe them. And they ARE her friends-aren't they?<br /><br />DANGEROUS COMRADES tells the story that is all too current and painfully relevant. Gangs surround is in every city across the country. And they target our children when they sense insecurity, an apparent lack of close friends, new in town...myriad traps for the unwary. Gangs and gang activity is escalating at a horrific rate. Hardly a day goes by without a report of a gang-related crime, drive-by-shooting, and even the deaths of innocent bystanders caught in the cross-fire or backlash. It is truly alarming.<br /><br />But this story is hardly new. As I read Dani's story, I was pulled back in time to David Wilkerson's CROSS AND THE SWITCHBLADE book, when...back in the 50's - 60's? This is a never-ending battle. Kids need to become aware. Parents need to be informed. This little book of 85 pages is an excellent start to that awareness. I urge every parent to get a copy and read it and encourage your children to read it. Dani is only twelve years old and she got snared into a potentially deadly situation. She was lucky. But not all gang members can escape. Many don't and are either still hopelessly ensnared with no way out-or dead.<br /><br />Gang affiliation is not about fun. It is not about friends. Gangs ARE about vandalism, graffiti, drugs, stealing, beatings and killings. It is the embodiment of all that is evil sucking in our youth today. And it is deadly. If you suspect your child is involved in a gang, get help immediately.<br /><br />DANGEROUS COMRADES - get the book.

Deborah Haskins is devastated at the death of her young husband of only eighteen months. They had just bought a small farm that was Andy's life-long dream, and now he was gone. Deb felt she had to stay on the farm. It was what Andy would have wanted and she was determined to hang on, to keep his dream alive, despite pressure from her mother to 'move back home.'  \\"This is my home. It was Andy's dream.\\"<br /><br /> <br /><br />When a young man appears at the farm a few months after the funeral, she remembers meeting him briefly at the graveside. An uneasy feeling creeps over her as he approaches. His name is Gideon Clermont, a man who served with Andy in Korea. Deborah learns that, in fact, Andy had saved Gideon's life, and Andy had asked Gideon to come to the farm to help with renovations.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Gideon's quiet demeanor lulls Deborah's caution as he steadfastly sets about fixing things on the farm, working Saturdays. As time goes on, Deborah can no longer fight her attraction. Their romance blossoms and Deborah heals as her grief fades and she looks forward to a new, happy life.<br /><br /> <br /><br />But she discovers her new husband has kept a terrible secret from her, and as it emerges Deborah learns that her healing came with a price. She turns to Christ for strength and guidance as she tries to cope with this new sorrow. When Gideon nearly kills their young son, Deborah knows it is time to make a decision. Has it come too late?<br /><br /> <br /><br />Working through her own painful experiences, Robin Lee Hatcher tells a story of hope and heartbreak, faith and second chances. She has bravely tackled a subject that all too often gets covered up and swept under the carpet. We live through the agony of the non-violent form of alcoholism in the story of Deborah and Gideon. It is hard to know which way you want Deborah to behave as you feel her anger and pain, love, hate and despair. I fell in love with Gideon and I felt myself just as angry, hurt, disgusted and hopeless as Deborah. And sometimes I wanted to shake her for putting up with it as long as she did.<br /><br /> <br /><br />This is Deborah's story, but Beyond The Shadows is told in a unique style, with vignettes as seen through the eyes of her neighbors, parents and her pastor. It reveals how ill-equipped the Christian family is to deal with alcoholism, or any addiction. The truth is, as Deborah discovers, we can only handle it through faith in Jesus and leaning on Him for the strength to cope. Beyond the Shadows is a gripping story, difficult to read at times as Hatcher pulls you right into Deborah's heart, head and life. Highly recommended.disgusted and hopeless as Deborah.

Jodi, Nony, Hoshi, Adele, Florida and the rest are back. This time they deal with some pretty serious issues. Denny, Jodi's husband, is accused by MaDear, Adele's mother, of lynching her baby brother; Nony takes off to Africa when her mother has a stroke; Florida, now with custody of her young daughter, has to deal with Carla's hostility - she wants to go back to her foster parents, and Hoshi has to tell her Shinto parents that she is a Christian.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The incident between Denny and MaDear brings a whole new set of circumstances to the multi-racial group as Adele separates herself from her praying sisters. Old hurts and prejudices come to the surface, and the entire group learns a new way of praying.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Jodi's healing after her accident that killed a young boy, is a long, slow process. Not just physically, but mentally, spiritually and emotionally as well. An ugly confrontation at the school where she teaches third grade force her to take a whole new look at forgiveness. Is she really responsible for the sins of others? How do you pray that way?<br /><br /> <br /><br />And what about that drug-crazed woman who forced her way into Jodi's home during a Yada Yada prayer meeting and robbed them at knife-point. A knife that actually drew blood? The long-reaching consequences of that terrifying day permanently affect the lives of all who were there.<br /><br /> <br /><br />I found this second book from Neta Jackson to be quite a reading experience. All these women, who met for the first time at a women's rally in Chicago, come from vastly diverse social and cultural backgrounds. Their bonds grow stronger through each experience as a group, and individually. They meet in each other's homes for prayer; they take turns visiting each other's churches, learning even more about themselves and their sisters. I particularly enjoyed the visit to Ruth's church. Ruth, a Messianic Jew, gives some great descriptions and deep insight into the blending of the old and the new.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Down - on their knees. On a book-rating scale, this gets 5-Stars. On a scale of 1 to 10 - this is definitely a 10. I can't recommend it highly enough.

At thirteen, she has already been in and out of five foster homes. She is angry, sullen, defensive and defiant of all attempts at authority. Her latest escapade finds her suspended from school and in danger of being sent to juvenile detention-the end of the road.<br /><br />But Tom and Eileen Chambers, of Keystone Stables, decide they will take a chance on Skye and the judge remands her to their care. This is Skye's last chance yet all she can see is one more foster home. She resentfully settles in to a new routine, determined to take the first opportunity to run away-her answer to everything she can't handle.<br /><br />Skye quickly realizes that this foster home is a lot different than all the others. She has her own room which she is allowed to decorate to suit herself, but she is expected to perform her share of chores both inside the house and outside, including the stables.<br /><br />And she has to earn the privilege of learning to ride Champ, the horse she's fallen in love with. When her disobedience grounds her, she finds that she is not able to ride Champ - she can't even go near him for two weeks. And her desire to ride Champ puts her at odds with her own attitude. Along with the love lavished on her by Tom and Eileen, Skye learns of the love of God and that His love is hers, even though she believes she doesn't deserve it. All she has to do is ask. Will she be able to let go of the bitterness and anger she's lived with so long and accept all the love that is so freely given?<br /><br />THE TROUBLE WITH SKYE is book one in the Keystone Stables series. Marsha Hubler has written with insight showing the mind and feelings of rebellious kids who seem to have fallen through the cracks, shuffled off to one home after another when their foster parents can no longer deal with them. I have no idea how many kids like Skye there are out there, nor do I know if there are enough people like Tom and Eileen around to open their homes and hearts and give the tough love these kids so sorely need. Maybe you have a teen or know of one who is in this same situation. This is good writing. I urge you to find this book. And watch for Book 2: A TRUE TEST FOR SKYE.to open their homes and hearts and give the tough love these kids so sorely need. Maybe you have a teen or know of one who is in this same situation.

Skye Nicholson has found love and security with Tom and Eileen Chambers at Keystone Stables. Skye had been shunted from one foster home after another had finally exhausted the patience of the judge who was ready to place her in juvenile detention and throw away the key. She is `rescued' when Tom and Eileen take her into their home and heart. And of course, Skye's \\"love affair\\" with Champ, the thoroughbred Quarter Horse upon whose back she won a blue ribbon has helped with her growth.<br /><br />Sooze Bodner, a friend and fellow juvenile delinquent, is in trouble, and her influence threatens to pull Skye back into her old ways. Sooze lives at home with her indifferent mother who has given up on discipline, allowing Sooze to do just as she pleases-and she does. Faced with the same final destination of juvenile detention as Skye had, Sooze is placed in the care of Tom and Eileen. Sooze is a hard case, and even though Skye tries to tell her it's not so bad, Sooze plots to escape. She thinks she can do things her own way and doesn't have to obey the rules set down by Tom and Eileen.<br /><br />With Sooze around, Skye faces some tough challenges. When Skye gets caught up in Sooze's attempt to escape the resulting crisis brings both girls to a realization of what it means to have a loving God and to learn to put their trust in Him, no matter how bleak or uncertain the future may be.<br /><br />A TRUE TEST FOR SKYE is book two in the Keystone Stables series. We met Skye in book one, THE TROUBLE WITH SKYE. Marsha Hubler does another great job with book two, and I urge to get both of these books, especially if you have, or know of, a teen that is in similar trouble. Also, watch for book three, TROUBLE TIMES TWO, coming soon, and book four, TEAMWORK AT CAMP TIOGA, coming in spring, 2005. I highly recommend these books.	2004-11-30

Debra Patterson leaves her two young children, 8-year-old Chad, and 5-year old Lauren, beneath the sheltering entry of a Houston shopping mall while she dashes through the downpour to get their car. When she returns to pick them up, they are gone -vanished.<br /><br />It is every mother's nightmare. And a recipe for guaranteed, first-class guilt. Yet, when Debra learns her husband, a demanding, autocratic man, has also disappeared, her panic and fear change focus. Did Michael take the kids? Why? Where are they? Are they safe?<br /><br />As the investigation deepens, drawing in the FBI and other agencies involved in missing children, Debra drops into a deep pit of guilt, self-condemnation, fear and anxiety. Alcohol doesn't dim the pain. Time passes with no results. No one has seen the children - no one. They have completely disappeared.<br /><br />Contrary to what one would expect, Debra volunteers her time and energies at the children's ward in the hospital. Despite the inevitable pain of holding and comforting someone else's child rather than her own, Debra finds comfort in what she is doing. Despite her efforts to ward off the unwelcome and unwanted attentions of Dr. Cale Thurston, Debra comes to depend on his strong friendship and support.<br /><br />Finally, Debra and Cale take matters into their own hands. The consequences of their actions could jeopardize and even kill any possible chance of Debra ever finding and regaining custody of her children. Yet, they must try.<br /><br />FOOTSTEPS will rip your heart out. No mother on earth can read this and not weep or resist the urge to run and hug her own children, safe and snug in their beds at home. It is all too easy to place oneself in Debra's position. But Debra grows. Rather than succumb to despair and self-destructive guilt, Debra seeks faith and understanding, even though she fights it every step of the way. Will she be able to face a life without ever finding her children? Can she give total surrender to God's will - no matter what?<br /><br />FOOTSTEPS is probably one of the best books I've read this year.

Imagine a perfect world, where school children are completely healthy, churches offer unconditional love, acceptance and hope, and long-dreaded diseases have been conquered. Such is the situation as A FORM OF GODLINESS opens. Yet if you take the time to look beneath this benevolent surface, something dark and horrifying exists.<br /><br />In this world, drastically changed long after 9/11, we meet Matthew Bridger, Christian President of the United States, Bryson Lawe, Secret Service agent assigned to the President, and Karen Foley, Christian activist. Despite increasing pressure, President Bridger steadfastly refuses to succumb to threats and pressures by those forces determined to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. Bridger knows what happens to those who oppose the Jewish nation, recalling the fate of the Philistines, Babylon, Assyria, Rome, and Nazi Germany-all determined to annihilate the Jews.<br /><br />An oil embargo forces the United States to tap its own limited resources and rationing, angering the American citizens. This puts increasing pressure on the U.S. to withdraw its support of Israel. And the threat of nuclear war is an ever-present dangling sword.<br /><br />Karen is hired at Sacred Child, an organization dedicated to the preservation and sanctity of life. When she discovers the horrible truth behind the benevolent façade of Life Quality, an organization diametrically opposed to everything Sacred Child stands for, despite all their lofty claims, Karen is determined to do whatever it takes to shut them down. But the cost of such opposition is high. Perhaps too high.<br /><br />I found this book to be frighteningly real, and all too plausible. It is well-written, plot and character well developed. Even though set in the-perhaps not too distant-future it rings so true and the stage could very well be setting up right now. The world, the America, of this book has no room for God. His name has been removed from all currency, public places, the Pledge of Allegiance...sound familiar? Yet Christians continue to struggle against the forces of evil. But will it be enough?<br /><br />A FORM OF GODLINESS should be read by every American. It is a glimpse into what is in store for us in America and around the world if we continue down the path we're headed.e of Allegiance...sound familiar?

Soon, Jeff and Sarah announce their engagement, and happy plans are underway for the wedding.<br /><br />But Sarah's fifteen-year-old son Paul is not happy.

His is an inquisitive mind and when he spots something not quite right, he is determined to get to the bottom of it.<br />That early in the morning, the boys often saw some pretty strange things: customers locked outside their house while retrieving the paper just delivered, not necessarily ready to meet the world - like a lady in curlers and green stuff on her face. But the boys instinctively adopted a rule of silence about what they saw on their daily route.<br />However, one morning, during their summer vacation, while it is still dark, the boys notice a tow-truck backing up to the car parked in the driveway of one of their customers. A man gets out of the truck and approaches the car, while in the cab sits another man. Tom gets a glimpse of him. He wears a light blue shirt with a nametag on the front and a patch on the sleeve. The man had dark hair. Though his face was hidden, Tom saw the name on his shirt -- \\"Jake.\\"<br />But the man outside the truck sees the boys and instead of hooking up the car to tow it away he quickly runs back to the truck, jumps in and drives away with squealing tires and a trail of blue smoke. \\"That's strange,\\" thought Tom.

Title: RANSOM'S MARK<br />Author: Wendy Lawton<br />Reviewer: Peggy Phifer<br />Publisher: Moody Publishers<br />ISBN: 0-8024-3638-2 / [money amount]<br />Genre: Children/Youth Fiction<br />When Olive Oatman's pa gets the urge to move west to California, he packs his family and belongings into a covered wagon and they leave their home in Fulton, Illinois. Olive is the third oldest child of six, with baby number seven due along the way. Olive and her brothers and sisters dream of the coming adventure and excitement. But there was no way they could have imagined what the journey would really be like on the Santa Fe Trail.<br />Trouble begins early when the wagon-master starts to change the plans all had agreed on when they signed up. Eventually, the train splits in two, and Olive's wagon goes with a smaller group to continue on the Santa Fe Trail. Gradually, other wagons drop off at the towns along the way, until only the Oatman wagon is left to continue on. Then, a renegade band of Yavapai Indians attacks the lone wagon, and Olive and her little sister Mary Ann are captured.<br />Olive and her sister are eventually ransomed from the Yavapai by the beautiful daughter of the chief of a Mohave tribe, but her life is still hard. Branded with a Mohave tattoo, Olive struggles to understand. How can this be a mark of God's love?<br />This true story of Olive Oatman is one of the most inspiring stories of courage I've read in a long time. Wendy Lawton has treated this story with great discretion and sensitivity to make it readable for her target age-group of 8-12-year olds. Yet she has managed to bring out the stark reality of the dangers the westward pioneers faced.<br />Like the other three books in this series, \\"Courage to Run\\" [Harriet Tubman], \\"The Tinker's Daughter\\" [Mary Bunyan, daughter of John Bunyan], and \\"Almost Home,\\" [Mary Chilton, of the Mayflower], in \\"Ransom's Mark\\" Wendy Lawton has written another classic story of \\"Daughters of the Faith.\\" I highly recommend these books.<br />Peggy Phifer ©2003these books.<br />Peggy Phifer ©2003	2003-07-19

She feels as if she doesn't belong anywhere. Though she likes it well enough in Holland, it isn't really home. Born in England, she and her family, along with many other 'separatist' families fled to Holland because England would not let them worship God in their own way.<br />When Mary learns that they will be going to America, she begins to hope that she may finally find a home. But when they leave, it is just Mary, Mother and Father. Her older sisters remain behind, and so do some of her best friends. It is a sad parting when they leave Holland, while at the same time there is eagerness in the thoughts of getting to the New World. But first they have to stop in England.<br />In England they board the Mayflower, which will carry them to America, but there are many alarming delays before they are finally underway, and it is so late by then that they knew it would be winter before they got there.<br />A dangerous winter storm hits and the little band of Pilgrims become very sick with the motion of the rocking and pitching of the ship throughout the storm. Only a few stay healthy enough to take care of the rest, and many burdens are thrust on Mary's young shoulders. Yet as each day passes, Mary's thoughts keep her thinking \\"Almost home...I'm almost home.\\"<br />When the storm finally subsides, the passengers discover they have been blown off course, and are far north of their intended landing in Virginia. It is bitter cold when they finally make shore at Plymouth Rock, and their little group is not as large as when they left the shores of England. It is November, their supplies are either all gone or spoiled, and they won't be able to plant any crops until spring.<br />This is the story of a couragous girl who dreams of 'belonging' and finds that her sense of 'home' might not be what she thought it was.<br />This is the third book in Wendy Lawton's \\"Daughters of the Faith\\" Series and should become a part of every library in every family home.<br />A *must* read, along with the other two books in the series: \\"The Courage To Run,\\" about young Harriet Tubman, and \\"The Tinker's Daughter,\\" a story about young Mary Bunyan, the blind daughter of John Bunyan, author of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress.\\"<br />In all three, Wendy Lawton has painted a picture of youthful struggles with big issues, and weaves the love of God and the faithful way in which He deals with his children.A *must* read, along with the other two books in the series: \\"The Courage To Run,\\" about young Harriet Tubman, and \\"The Tinker's Daughter,\\" a story about young Mary Bunyan, the blind daughter of John Bunyan, author of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress.\\"<br />In all three, Wendy Lawton has painted a picture of youthful struggles with big issues, and weaves the love of God and the faithful way in which He deals with his children.	2003-04-28

I loved it.	Born blind, Mary Bunyan depended on others to paint visual pictures for her mind's eye to see. She felt there was no-one better able to do this than her father, John Bunyan. But when he is arrested for preaching, Mary, at age 10, is left without her picture stories. She is the oldest of the Bunyan children, and she becomes the one to carry supper to her father in jail every evening, but is tormented by a young boy who seems to concentrate all his mean and vicious tricks on Mary.<br />Her favorite Bible quote, and one she chants to herself constantly, is \\"I can do all things...I can do all things...\\" but she fails to remember the rest of the passage. She begins to think she can do it all and resents anyone suggesting that she may need help.<br />But she does need help, and through a series of events Mary finally remembers the rest of that Bible verse '...through Christ! who strengthens me.\\"<br />Though little is really known about Mary Bunyan, because she died so young, Wendy Lawton has done a great deal of research into the history of the time and has put together some logical sequences, a masterful blend of fact and fiction without ever losing sight of the character of Mary Bunyan as Wendy sees her.<br />And it is very plausible. That Mary existed there is no doubt. Yes, her father John Bunyan was arrested for preaching and spent close to 14 years in jail. The episode with the gypsies is fiction, though Wendy states that they were quite prevalent in the area during this time period, so it is believable.<br />I loved this book, and Wendy has skillfully blended what known facts are available on Mary Bunyan with other research information about the times and area and has created a very moving story about a young girl thrown into situations no 10-year-old should have to face.<br />Well done!	2003-04-28

This is a very engrossing book and one I could not put down until I finished it.<br />I normally do not like to read any book written in dialect. In fact, I will quite often go out of my way NOT to read them. I find they tend to slow down the read for me because I mentally try to sound out the dialect as I read. Very distracting.<br />But Wendy has done a superb job with Minty, and she managed to pull me in right at the start.<br />I think Harriet Tubman has been an inspiration to nearly everyone, regardless of race, because of her courageous actions once she decided \\"this is what I have to do!\\" and I am no exception. To see her story through the eyes of her youth is very enlightening...and heart-breaking.<br />Well written and well researched. A great read.	2003-04-28
