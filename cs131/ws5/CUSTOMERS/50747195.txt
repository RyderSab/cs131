US	50747195	R3CEY2TPRG7ND2	034544826X	45189839	Massachusetts, California, Timbuktu (Ballantine Reader's Circle)	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	There's no escaping parental neglect, indifference in strong debut novel	By the time readers have finished Stephanie Rosenfeld's compelling debut novel, they will have felt the same emotional exhaustion its intrepid twelve-year-old protagonist experienced as she accompanied her harried, depressed and neglectful mother on an ill-planned cross country journey.  \\"Massachusetts, California, Timbuktu\\" is not for the weak at heart.  It is an unrelentingly depressing book, marked by emotional abuse, emotional abandonment and surreal parenting.  Written through the perspective of the strong-hearted Justine, \\"Massachusetts\\" somehow finds a sense of ironic humor and unconquerable hope as Justine alternately takes care of her endearing younger sister and her maddeningly pathetic mother.   <br /> <br />The paperback version of the novel includes an interview with the author, who believes that Colleen is a \\"good mother.\\"  Despite the fact that Colleen is escaping an abusive relationship, nothing could be farther from the truth.  She is a horrible parent, so oblivious to her children's suffering that she refuses to (or is unable to) provide shelter, clothes, schooling and food for her children.  As if this physical neglect isn't bad enough, her children are given the privilege of witnessing delusional, self-destructive behaviors that should have had some public authority commit Colleen to an institution and place her two daughters in homes which provide a modicum of stability, protection and love. <br /> <br />Aware only that she does not have a father and that her hippy-like mother is serially involved with seemingly every loser on the planet, Justine longs for her own narrative, her own coherent understanding of life.  Justine describes her mother as a \\"human eraser,\\" more like \\"an alien who just couldn't figure out the puzzle of human life.\\"  Colleen never does get the idea of adult responsibility:  \\"Mom had a way of taking facts and mushing them into a kind of paste of feelings.\\"  Having an incompetent mother compels Justine to wrestle with some serious existential questions, and it is not surprising that the child develops an absurdist view of life.  All this is done while the twelve-year-old becomes the mother and the mother becomes the dependent child.  Justine even develops a color-coded system for remembering things Colleen tells her not to forget.  \\"Red was for things no one could really do, but I wrote them down anyway.\\"  An example of this would be when Colleen insists that Justine \\"remind her never to sacrifice her self-esteem to such an abusive jerk!\\" <br /> <br />Rosenfeld takes us on a cross-country trek with Justine as her mother tries to make gold from straw and her younger sister receives solace from television sets that show only snow.  The children feast on such delicacies as lint-covered chocolate mints salvaged from seat cushions and live in accommodations that crack-addicts would eschew.  Along the way, Colleen alienates friends and family from coast to coast, descending into clinical depression that immobilizes her.  All this occurs as Justine develops breasts, discovers prepubescent boys are idiotic jerks and tries to find ways to keep her mind alive despite sporadic and inadequate schooling. <br /> <br />Only the most obtuse reader could not discern the protagonist's inner voice, but the author inexplicably interweaves Justine's invented pioneer diary to show us what Justine is feeling.  Initially welcomed, the diary's passages become longer and more frequent throughout the novel.  The diary becomes increasingly intrusive while providing minimal insight.  Additionally, a more judicious editing of the book would have increased its impact.  Three hundred and fifty pages is more than sufficient to describe a loser mother and her valiant oldest daughter.  Justine is wise enough to understand that her mother will never improve.   <br /> <br />\\"Massachusetts, California, Timbuktu\\" shows Stephanie Rosenfeld's promise.  There is a flinty integrity to her writing, and her unflinching examination of family disintegration and parental indifference shows she is unafraid to tackle serious issues.  Despite its flaws, this is a satisfying novel.	2005-09-04
US	50747195	R3LFQXCTCUHSTU	0743245911	734522183	Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig	Books	5	4	7	N	Y	heroic Iron Horse emerges as fully human in moving biography	Lou Gehrig is a heroic icon; yet his very name elicits paradoxical, contradictory images:  one a ballplayer of seemingly indestructible endurance, the other a victim of a disease (which now bears his name) that irrevocably destroyed his exquisite body.  Jonathan Eig's perceptive, compassionate and authoritative biography, \\"Luckiest Man,\\" will not only cement Gehrig's lofty status in our national consciousness; it permits us to understand Gehrig as a conflicted, complex and compelling man.  Eig invests the \\"Iron Horse\\" with a humanity that corrects the media-created image of  Gehrig as the earnest Yankee, the quiet but machine-like second-fiddle to the flambouyant Babe Ruth.   Painstakingly researched, \\"Luckiest Man\\" is deeply moving.  Several passages simply cannot be read without our own tears belatedly joining the thousands that were shed when Gehrig gave his short, storied speech reverently remembered for its gracious and humbling self-description of Gehrig as a \\"lucky man.\\"  It is the reader who is lucky for the experience of reading Eig's stirring work. <br /> <br />The Lou Gehrig that emerges in Eig's biography is that of a man whose tremendous physical talent hid an ego that was painfully insecure.  The only surviving child of an immigrant family whose powerful mother established the emotional atmosphere of the home, Gehrig consistently wrestled with his sense of self.  As Eig noted, \\"He was built to conquer, yet programmed for failure.\\"  A sensitive and inquisitive man, \\"he lived and worked in an environment in which the expression of deep thoughts incited teasing.\\"  He consecrated his life to a work-ethic modeled by his mother; he believed in following the rules established by his managers, playing the game he loved with complete devotion and eschewing publicity for most of his career.  Eig thoroughly debunks the notion that Gehrig was not aware of his consecutive game streak.  Gehrig played through broken bones, concussions and back pain, proud that he \\"had built a legacy on determination and grit.\\"  Never taking a day off  --  establishing a record for endurance  --  became a \\"bigger\\" goal with each game, a streak Gehrig \\"cherished.\\" <br /> <br />By the 1930s, Gehrig had become a symbol for the hard times of the Great Depression.  He was \\"durable, dependable and dignified.\\"  He gloried in dedication, and he believed in hard work.  \\"No one prepared better for a game...and no one hustled harder on the field.\\"  He \\"flung his body over railings to catch foul balls\\" and often used his bare hand to catch poor throws to first base.  Gehrig said, \\"There is no excuse for a player not hustling.\\"   <br /> <br />These archtypical American values were not in vogue when Gehrig broke in with the Yankees in the 1920s.  Those years belonged to Babe Ruth, the living embodiment of the Jazz Age.  Eig paints a complicated relationship between the two men  --  Ruth, larger-than-life, libertine in lifestyle and perpetually forgiving; Gehrig, the company man, painfully shy around women and content to simply do his job better than anyone else.  It was a contrast between \\"the mama's boy and the rascal.\\" <br /> <br />In truth, Gehrig's greatest challenges occurred off the diamond.  Unapologetically bound to his mother, Chrstina, Gehrig did not attain any semblance of adult maturation until he married the headstrong and dynamic Eleanor Twitchell.  Eig chronicles how Eleanor encouraged Gehrig to capitalize on his name, to open himself to the possibilities of tasting life, to develop what we would now label emotional intelligence.  It is with his beloved wife we see Gehrig sobbing at the opera \\"Tristan and Isolde.\\"  It is his trusted wife whom he cannot stand the idea of disappointing.  Even when stricken with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Gehrig endeavored to lessen her worry, her discomfort, her fears.  Through Eig's sensitive descriptions, we see Gehrig as a loving man. <br /> <br />Eig makes ALS understandable and places the disease in historical perspective.  The general, and understandable, ignorance of the medical community made diagnosis difficult and treatment haphazard and variable.  Though Eig shares Gehrig's admiration for the Mayo Clinic, the author does not share the patient's absolute belief in it.  In fact, when the Mayo Clinic finally made public Genrig's condition, it did so with an inept and inaccurate allusion to polio.  This misinformation led sportswriters to not only preposterous assertions, but downright ugly ones.  One benighted scribe blamed Gehrig for infecting his teammates with his energy-sapping disease, thus causing an early season Yankee slump. <br /> <br />Just as Lou Gehrig took demonstrable pride in his craft, Jonathan Eig has done so with his writing talents in \\"Luckiest Man.\\"  It is obvious that the author respects and admires his subject, but his biography is never fawning.  \\"Luckiest Man\\" is meticulously researched (it contains nearly 30 pages of footnotes) and contains numerous quotations from those who played with and against Gehrig. The work also benefits from the discovery of Gehrig's post-ALS correspondence.  Eig's prose is clean and clich-free.  Most importantly, it is convincing.  In this definitive biography, Lou Gehrig deserves the revered place he holds in our hearts.	2005-08-13
US	50747195	R337AOANHHIP6Z	0156032023	549807243	The Circus in Winter	Books	5	15	16	N	Y	an astounding achievement, brilliantly written, thematically compelling	Some fifty years from now, literary critics will judge Cathy Day's debut novel, \\"The Circus in Winter,\\" as a masterpiece of early twenty-first century American fiction.  So that there is no misunderstanding my opinion of \\"Circus,\\" I believe her writing is exquisite, luminescent and profound.  In the same manner that Sherwood Anderson captured the essence of a small Midwest town in \\"Winesburg, Ohio,\\" Day, with compassion and extraordinary insight, has drawn a portrait of a physical and emotional community in our heartland.  Lima, Indiana, the wintering spot for the Great Porter Circus, emerges as a microcosm of the human condition.  Through Day's assured and courageous interrelated stories, we learn more than we want, not just about circus life, but the dreams, disappointments and desires that motivate our behaviors. <br /> <br />Psychological tensions abound in this multi-generational novel-in-stories.  There is the tension of an America in transition from its agrarian past to its industrial, technological present.  There is the tension between men and women, between love and loss, between hopes and despair.  There is the tension between illusion and reality.  There is even unspoken tension in the names of the characters, particularly the Perdido family, whose Spanish surname signifies being \\"lost.\\" <br /> <br />One of Day's most significant triumphs is her revisionist interpretation of the ringmaster's oft-repeated benediction:  \\"May all your days be circus days.\\"  Said as a blessing, the words often indicate a curse.  The author understands the conflicting impulses which draw us to the circus.  We wish to be disgusted as much as we wish to be entertained.  We hope to be made afraid as much as we want to laugh.  We admire the singularity of circus performers but are repelled by their transience, aberrance and recklessness.  These contradictory impulses of mirth and menace, of delight and death, of hope and helplessness appear and reappear in the characters whose lives we come to understand in \\"Circus.\\" <br /> <br />Each story contains its own truth, and every character discovers some essential epiphany.  The founder of the circus, Wallace Porter, purchases a floundering circus in 1885 as a result of unbearable loss.  Deprived of love, Porter intends to redeem a broken promise made to his terminally-ill young wife.  He learns that no endeavor can replace a cavernous hole in the heart.  Jennie Dixianna has escaped a brutal childhood and has perfected a \\"Spin of Death,\\" in which she repeatedly swivels from a hanging rope, leaving her wrist perpetually bloody.  She understands men's wants and needs, but is unable to love.  Instead, he collects what her lovers have left.  In a cedar box is \\"contained the flotsam of men's pockets, the skeletons that hung like ghosts in their back-hall closets.\\"  Her story is a \\"collage of broken glass from a thousand shattered bottles, and each new shard made her stronger and more beautiful.\\" <br /> <br />Day is unafraid of tackling the circus' perpetuation of racism.  Bascomb Bowles emerges as a living symbol of our national need to humiliate African-Americans.  His career with the Great Porter Circus ironically begins as an African \\"pinhead,\\" a perceived promotion from his previous job of cleaning human waste from \\"honey buckets.\\"  Bowles is aware that he is perpetuating a stereotype; yet he brings a quiet dignity to his own struggles for economic and emotional survival.  We watch with predictable horror and shame as Bowles' family evolves over the next four generations.  The author also shows how one singular event, the death of an elephant trainer, transmutes itself into story and myth over time, affecting the descendants of the deceased and influencing their perceptions of possibility, obligation and purpose.  Day compels us to acknowledge that we prefer illusion to truth, interpretation instead of facts, comfort over conscience. <br /> <br />Although \\"The Circus in Winter\\" ought be read as written, you could pick any story as a point of origin.  Cathy Day's prose is so seamless that each chapter could stand by itself but remains essential to the novel's whole.  Her characters, painstakingly drawn and honestly rendered, compel us to examine ourselves, to learn how much we wrestle with the same dilemmas, how much we are circus people.  After the greasepaint is removed, after the illusion is replaced by the everyday, after the excitement is tempered by frustration, the characters of the Great Porter Circus must face themselves.  When we confront them, we see ourselves.	2005-08-01
US	50747195	R354T7TN3DGIMR	1582345821	55194424	I, Fatty: A Novel	Books	5	1	4	N	Y	Stahl's faux memoir takes us behind scrim of Hollywood Babylon	In capturing the torment of an abused child and the horrific anguish of a falsely-accused adult, Jerry Stahl's brilliant faux memoir of the storied Hollywood silent movie star Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle compels us to confront our desire to create celebrities and rejoice in their demise.  \\"I, Fatty\\" gives Arbuckle a humanity his oversized body precluded his fans and detractors from understanding.  Told in the actor's own voice, the novel contains two parts.  The second is the detailed recounting of Arbuckle's three trials for his alleged rape and murder of Virginia Rappe.  It is this aspect of the actor's life that topples him from the pinnacle of artistic and financial success and drives him to the depths of pariah status.  More compelling, however, is the first half of \\"I, Fatty,\\" which painfully details Arbuckle's childhood, once scarred by an abusive father, family disintegration and subsequent abandonment.  Roscoe's victimization has a cumulative impact on his forming image of his character, one eventually incorporating self-blame and self-destructive behaviors. <br /> <br />Delivered as a breech birth, Arbuckle's size may have contributed to his mother's demise.  Regardless, his alcoholic and anger-crazed father blamed him for every conceivable misfortune and focused on ridiculing his son's size.  Arbuckle recalls his father's \\"whiskey-stench breath singeing\\" his nostrils, and his father's \\"fist waggling in my face like a cobra's head in a snake-charmer act.\\"  Unable to defend himself in this unceasing onslaught on his very personhood, it comes as no shock to hear the adult Arbuckle matter-of-factly admit his inability to perform sexually.  As a child, Roscoe would pinch himself \\"to create an outside pain big enough to blank out the pain inside.\\" <br /> <br />From this maelstrom of neglect and abuse, the Kansas-born Arbuckle eventually finds work on stage in California, where through comedic instinct and a willingness to work hard at any task given him, he becomesa successful self-made man.  Overcoming an initial reluctance to perform in the movies (where no self-respecting actor would ever seek employment), Arbuckle slowly understands the basis of his popularity.  Despite considerable physical agility, by the age of 26, Arbuckle \\"didn't like what it was people liked about me.\\"  He spends time whispering to himself:  \\"I am so tired of being the Fat Guy.  But, of course, a diet would have ruined me.\\"  The basis of this overweight actor's popularity was \\"that no matter how poorly any of `em felt, they could all wake up glad they weren't me.\\" <br /> <br />Through Arbuckle's confessions, Stahl spares no punches in describing the cynicism, hype and hypocrisy of the early Hollywood studio system.  In the midst of the post-World War I reaction  --  a time of the Red Scare, a fixed World Series and an open renewal of racist, nativist prejudice  --  the same publicity machine that raved about Arbuckle's innocent, cherubic qualities turned on him with absolute venom once the San Francisco authorities charged him with murder and rape.  Stahl spends a great deal of time exposing the \\"show trials\\" that forever stripped Arbuckle's dignity and ability to make a living from him.  His eventual ringing exoneration made him even more detestable in the eyes of his accusers. <br /> <br />Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle is no saint.  A drug addict, an alcoholic, a failed husband, Arbuckle made and wasted a fortune.  He had few friends, though those who remained close to him, like Buster Keaton, emerge as moral pillars at a time when vicious rumor-mongers like William Randolph Hearst cast vile shadows over the country.  Through Jerry Stahl's imagined voice, Arbuckle achieves something he never was able to manage during his life:  a legacy of a complicated, vulnerable, conflicted but honorable man.	2005-07-25
US	50747195	R17RXX2NPQV2YC	0345460987	616639398	Going to Bend: A Novel	Books	4	6	9	N	Y	Oregon women explore depths of friendship and possibilites of love	At first glance, Hubbard, Oregon, doesn't have a lot to brag about.  This nondescript Pacific Ocean town, dependent on fishing and the occasional tourist for its perilous economic survival, confronts grey, gloomy skies and seemingly interminable rain.  There are no colleges nearby, no cultural attractions, nothing which could attract visitors to stay.  But in Diane Hammond's hands, Hubbard has an internal life that is both distinct and universal.  The characters who populate her warm and affecting debut novel, \\"Going to Bend,\\" are complicated, bruised and determined people.  Each has his or her distinctive heartbreak, and each earnestly, clumsily but steadfastly finds a way to endure, even to prevail.   <br /> <br />The novel focuses on the friendship between tough-as-nails Petie Coolbaugh and mother-earth-type Rose Bundy, but Hammond suffuses this friendship with the tormented past of Petie and the unsure present of  Rose.  Not only do the two women complement each other, their differing perspectives, attitudes and behaviors give depth and heft to the narrative.  Petie has suffered terribly in her life; emotionally and sexually abused as a child, she has hardened herself to life and allowed her horizons to shrink.  She is as fog-shrouded as Hubbard when it comes to opening herself to life.  Unaware that she exudes a powerful sexuality, Petie languishes in a loveless marriage and laments the condition of her two sons, the eldest a sensitive child who is dominated by his learning-challenged younger sibling. <br /> <br />Rose's quandary is quieter, but just as significant.  Involved with a soft-spoken fisherman who stays but several months a year with her, Rose accepts the temporary while yearning for permanence.  Her blossoming teen-age daughter, who is only now coming-to-grips with her sexuality, suddenly intertwines herself in her mother's understated and ill-defined relationship with Jim Christie. <br /> <br />As Hammond develops Petie's growing disaffection withthe restricted boundaries of her life and Rose's determined efforts to provide coherence to her own, the author gracefully explores how two small-town women broaden their emotional boundaries.  Petie and Rose develop a business relationship with a couple that has inexplicably moved to Hubbard from Los Angeles.  Nadine and Gordon atypical restaurant owners; Gordon has AIDS and Nadine devotes herself to his care.  Petie and Rose do much more than prepare homemade soups; they progressively incorporate these two strangers into the warp and woof of Hubbard life. <br /> <br />It is this quality of inclusion that gives \\"Going to Bend\\" its optimistic flavor.  Amidst the sorrows of childhood abuse, alcoholism, sterile marriage, terminal illness and existential loneliness, Petie and Rose summon the courage to live honorable, full lives.  It is the mortar of friendship that permits them to do so.	2005-07-22

Where Potok has succeeded, Mirvis has failed.  \\"The Outside World,\\" simply stated, is a terrible novel.  Despite Mirvis' best intentions, she has written a clich-ridden, hackneyed and staggeringly wooden account about two families whose dilemmas could have become compelling to a universal audience had a more confident author described them.  Only the most devoted followers of the Orthodox way of life could find pleasure in reading this saccharine, self-congratulatory work.  Aside from its absorption in ponderous detail (after all, how interesting is it to read about scouring a kitchen with toothpicks to remove leavened bread before Passover?), the novel's most pernicious achievement is perfuming the noxious odors of gender stereotyping, social segregation and female loss of identity. <br /> <br />\\"The Outside World,\\" whose central concept rather uncritically explains that Orthodox Jewish girls, and their mothers, think of little else than marriage is downright frightening.  Mirvis' Orthodox world limits women from the time of their birth and showers girls with every conceivable rationalization to accept second-class citizenship.  What's scary about \\"The Outside World\\" is that the author doesn't seem to have any qualms about this set of circumstances.  Not only that, the novel has a plot that is predictable from the second paragraph.  Reading \\"World\\" is much like viewing your friend's seven-hour (!!) wedding video; there are a few moments of extraordinary clarity and transcendent beauty, but there are hours of detailed tedium, leaving spectators, even the most keenly interested ones, yearning to grab the remote control and push the fast forward button.  <br /> <br />Archetypical Jewish characters alternate between accepting and flailing away at their condition.  Protagonist Tzippy Goldman spends the first half of the novel agonizing over not being married and the second half, predictably, lamenting the fact that marriage is not all that it was cooked up to be.  Her over-the-top mother, whose deep, dark secret is the fact that she's not a \\"pure\\" Orthodox, does everything but shout \\"Oy, vey\\" over her daughter's shameful unmarried status.  Addle-brained Herschel Goldman fulfills every conceivable expectation as a schlemazel; with a father like him, his daughters would be justified in thanking God that they weren't born a man, ironically changing the wording of the infamous Orthodox blessing.  Tzippy's beloved Bryan/Baruch comes from a family no less besieged by difficulties.  His father, a symbolically assimilated rational Orthodox lawyer, stoically watches his son go off the deep end while his earnestly-devoted mother tries everything from acquiescent support to zen-like healing circles to bring her family back together.  The only character in the novel with any believability is Bryan/Baruch's fourteen-year-old sister, Ilana; her questioning, her sense of displacement and her anger are authentic, all the more so given that her status is unresolved at the novel's conclusion. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have extolled the novel's treatment of serious religious themes.  \\"The Outside World\\" does try to pay respects to the conflicts between modernity and tradition, spirituality and the real world, individual responsibility and adherence to group mores.  Don't be deceived by the veneer of sophistication.  Tova Mirvis has not created a worthy sequel to \\"The Ladies Auxiliary.\\"  This is Judaism \\"lite,\\" frothy, fun and utterly unsubstantial.	2005-06-09

Her self-named protagonist  --  that alone makes \\"Bowling\\" courageous  --  not only wonders whether she will ever find someone special with whom to share her life, she gives voice to some of the most serious questions we could ask ourselves.  Do \\"any of us know what we really want.\\"  Even if blessed with such knowledge, how do we manufacture the strength to fully put \\"our hearts\\" into living.  That Olson can address such personal questions with ironic humor, sarcastic self-observation and self-deprecatory candor are the signal strengths of this easily-read novel.  \\"Children\\" is marred only by a contrived, melodramatic conclusion that uses a shopworn literary device to assist her protagonist achieve the epiphany necessary for living a full life. <br /> <br />It's unfortunate that Olson's somewhat mawkish conclusion diminishes the first two-hundred pages of her novel.  \\"Children\\" bristles with anger, frustration and subterranean hope, as the protagonist Shannon, aided by two understated, quirky and compassionate therapists, battles her domineering mother and wrestles with a nagging and seemingly perpetual sense of loneliness.  Her mother, Flo, casts an omnipresent shadow over Shannon's life.  If the daughter speaks openly about her sadness, her mother dismisses it as insignificant compared to her troubles.  When Shannon determines to break away and establish the boundaries necessary for a healthy relationship between an adult daughter and her mother, Flo bemoans being cast aside.  Ever sharp-tongued, Flo criticizes Shannon's wardrobe, mocks her eating habits (McDonald's comes in for special ridicule), disparages her apartment and demeans her career.  In so doing, Flo is never so happy as when she can, with a passive-aggressive quip, micromanage Shannon's life. <br /> <br />As both siblings and friends marry and create families, Shannon is left ever more aware of her freak-like status as a single woman.  Her constant companion, Adam, confuses her; is he just a \\"friend,\\" or does his constant presence signify something greater.  Readers quickly recognize that Adam fulfills the identical psychological functions Flo satisfies.  Fastidious, proper and anal, Adam happily offers to organize Shannon's closet, including alphabetizing and paper-clipping mounds of debris Shannon refers to as paperwork.  What is apparent to readers is obscure to Shannon, who never seems to muster the temerity to openly question Adam about the nature of their relationship.   <br /> <br />Shannon's despair is always tinctured with humor.  When her therapist, Dr. Douglas, whom Shannon believes receives inspiration from such diverse television resources as ESPN and the History Channel, asks about what she does with her spare time, she responds that \\"the only pieces of equipment required for my favorite hobbies\\" are \\"the remote control and the credit card.\\"  Dr. Douglas suggests she \\"leave the nest and explore the richness of life;\\" to Shannon, \\"life had proven to be a big, fat artery-clogging vat of hollandaise sauce.\\"  She's a shy, slightly-overweight Minnesota Catholic in a land of svelte Lutherans, where \\"quality\\" people are those who aren't \\"kind of different.\\" <br /> <br />Shannon's failures are endearing, and she is undaunted by setbacks in her persistent quest for companionship and happiness.  She's quite the opposite of the glamorized New York City single woman; there's no \\"sex-in-the-city\\" for this protagonist...just drive-through meals and doing laundry with her carping mother.  Shannon Olson's anguish is not spectacular, but persistent, not energizing, but energy-sapping.  Yet she never stops looking for love.  The author, Shannon Olson, should have been content to leave her namesake in that earnest, quietly humorous quest rather than give her some answers in a contrived conclusion.  When theprotagonist finally picks up a bowling ball in the novel's conclusion, we are pretty well tipped off if she's going to roll a gutter ball or a strike.	2005-05-30
US	50747195	R3P4U0V9OQN7LF	1594480818	353133291	Crossing California	Books	5	9	10	N	N	over-the-top, but oh-so-right view of Jewish adolescent life	Adam Langer's \\"Crossing California\\" succeeds on so many levels, it is difficult to categorize its most significant achievement.  This stunning coming-of-age novel set in Chicago during the late 1970s deftly captures the ambience of Jewish culture, the subterranean tensions of family dysfunction and the poignantly humorous travails of adolescents wrestling with issues of sexuality, friendship and identity.  It is clear that Langer knows the terrain of his novel; written with extraordinary precision, the novel contains exquisitely detailed descriptive passages and absolutely credible inclusion of the vernacular of that time and place.  Not only does Langer know his city, he loves his characters, investing each of his intriguing cast with an evident humanity.  Their flaws are as endearing as their strengths, their foibles as compelling as their triumphs. <br /> <br />Each character in \\"Crossing California\\" embarks on a particular passage, a genuine crossing from one stage of life to another.  The literary convention of spiritual quest is certainly not a new one, but Langer gives it a refreshing tweak because of its ubiquity.  Adults and adolescents, major and minor characters alike, find themselves at pivotal moments in their lives, flailing away at the limits of their lives, stretching their imaginations or simply trying to understand their place in a time of enormous social change.  Regardless of individual circumstance, the characters grow, and their transformation, depicted with laugh-out-loud piquancy, is spellbinding. <br /> <br />\\"Crossing California\\" explores the distinct but unexpectedly intersecting lives of two skewed Jewish families, the Rovners and the Wasserstroms.  The Wasserstroms, struggling economically, experience the frustrations of unrequited hopes and embody the centrifugal forces ripping apart urban, ethnic families.  Enigmatic, questioning and idealistic, Jill Wasserstrom battles the loneliness engendered by her mother's premature death with iconoclastic views and a fatalistic acceptance that much of what she hopes will never materialize.   She is a sweet, ironic girl, who rebuffs her artistically-talented friend Muley's sincere, but awkward attempts at youthful romance.  On the other hand, Jill's older sister, Michelle, is a complex hellion.  Michelle tries on different personalities as often as she changes roles in her aspiration to become a professional actress.  She swings wildly from one sexual escapade to another, from indifference to her studies to aspirations for acceptance at Yale.  Her appetite for life is enormous.  Barely surviving his two daughters is placid, predictable and pathetic Charlie Wasserstrom.  Yet even befuddled Charlie, who desires nothing more than to be a dutiful father, will face personal transformation when an abrupt firing causes him to find a second chance in far more than employment. <br /> <br />The Rovners' surreal excesses distort their quest for the American Dream; they provide a painfully humorous twist to their frustrations and failures.  Sexually-frustrated Larry Rovner cannot terminate his marriage to his frosty, sarcastic wife Ellen.  Both are medical professionals, presumably dedicated to putting their patients' lives back together, but neither derives satisfaction from work and both harbor resentments about the sterility of life.  Their daughter, Lana, is well on the path of becoming a Jewish American Princess.  However, her penchant for kleptomania and obsessive devotion to achievement at any cost may well interfere with her goal.  Her brother Larry is deeply devoted to his religion, sexual conquest and music, often confusing one for the other.  He is not particularly competent at any of the above activities. <br /> <br />\\"Crossing California\\" is a laugh-out-loud read, and Adam Langer's observations about teen-age life, contemporary family dysfunction and Jewish identity shimmer with intelligence and insight.  Above it all is the obvious love the author has forhis characters.  By investing their limitations with compassion and by making their misadventures larger than life, Langer ropes readers into the web of his characters' lives.  It's a good place to be.	2005-05-22

Walbert's individual stories lack coherence; her prose tends to be overwritten, precious or overly obscure; her characters rarely invite sympathy or compassion, much less understanding.  Though Walbert intends \\"Our Kind\\" to provide insight into the genuine existential dilemmas aging women experience, the novel is really little more than a litany of sorror that poor little rich girls  --  now women  -- encounter. <br /> <br />Each character, whether she be physically disabled, ditzy, an artist, a widow, cancer-stricken, jaded or booze-addled, has been \\"led down a primrose lane, then abandoned somewhere near the carp pond.\\"  Forsaking intellectual aspirations and career possibilities contemporary women now presume as birthrights, these erudite, Smith-educated, polished (like prized apples) and repressed (orgasm-starved) characters chose or had chosen for them a life of taking \\"dictation from war heroes in grey suits.\\"  Their college curriculum consisted of the \\"3 G's:  Grace, Grooming and Grammar.  Some of us dropped out before Grace.\\"  They did everthing their men asked them to:  be homemakers, silent hostesses, acquiescent sexual partners and mothers.  Yet, somewhere, by middle age, the wheels had fallen off.  The women of \\"Our Kind\\" keen with pain and betrayal. <br /> <br />Their collective voices form a chorus of sorrow and lament, not the presupposed aria of joy, contentment and fulfillment they had envisioned hearing.  \\"Our Kind\\" is a filled with an ineluctable sadness and no small amount of unresolved bitterness.  The women, budding with excitement in their 20s, now have gone to seed.  And what a disparate assortment of seeds...hair greying, unspoken anger bubbling over, regrets denouncing false hopes.  Their loneliness slaps them daily across their reconstructed faces. <br /> <br />Each character, because of Walbert's preculiar, ill-chosen style, never fully articulates her angst.  Yet, we can imagine them in their earlier lives, seated at their elegantly-arranged dinner tables, designing and executing parties to further their husands' careers, painfully aware that genuine conversations (like those savored with their professors in the Seven Sister Colleges) will never involve them.  Their very lives are in perpetual deferment. <br /> <br />All the elements for significant story telling are here.  Walbert's bon-mots, sprinkled at the end of each chapter (\\"our hearts worn down by the slow drumming of blood,\\" \\"we are...a school of fish too old to spawn but desperate to swim back upstream\\"), indicate a writer with great talent.  Yet, \\"Our Kind\\" disappoints.  Its structure, lack of narrative drive and choice of affluent, suburban, east-coast women (far removed from most American women's experiences) doom to the novel to be as satisfying as a furtive tryst with a hired pool boy.	2005-04-29
US	50747195	R2JFB2WKOFQT7Y	0803293178	300411922	Heroes: A Novel	Books	1	0	4	N	N	trite, cliche-ridden and phony, "Heroes" fouls out early	Heralded when it was first published in 1984 as a worthy companion to the classic sports novels of Mark Harris and Bernard Malamud, David Shields' \\"Heroes\\" is worthy neither as legitimate sports writing or as important literature.  Recently reissued by the University of Nebraska Press with a glossy, \\"artsy\\" cover, \\"Heroes\\" fails the test of time.  Not only is the vocabulary dated, but Shields' attempt to explore the themes of spiritual corruption, loss of innocence and the mythical place of sports heroes in our national culture fails miserably.  This novel is clich-ridden, patently manipulative of the reader's emotions and artificial in its treatment of any serious issue. <br /> <br />The protagonist, Albert Biederman, suffers from standard middle-age angst.  His wife is a stereotypical untenured college professor whose book makes sense only to her coterie of equally pedantic colleagues.  Naturally, their marriage is on the rocks.  Predictably, Biederman is himself a frustrated jock, and his discovery of basketball star Belvyn Menkus rocks his world.  Shields' most purple prose is reserved for Biederman's rhapsodic immortalization of Menkus' talents.  Acting more like a gushing, love-struck teenager than actual adult, Biederman faces his greatest challenge after he discovers gross irregularities in Menkus' academic past.  Should he reveal corruption and ruin his idol's life or should he become just another hack hometown booster masquerading as a reporter. <br /> <br />Instead of relying on such quaint concepts like journalistic ethics, Biederman depends on a cast of characters so pathetically shallow that their ensuing dialogues sound as if they derived from pulp fiction.  The nefarious, shadowy antagonist Raeburn, the scourge of amateur athletics in America's heartland, is no Arnold Rothstein; Raeburn's corruption reads today as penny-ante, insignificant.  As if this weren't painful enough, the author ham-handedly describes the deterioration of River City, Iowa, from childhood idyllic perfection to wanton, nihilistic urban renewal.  I'm convinced that Shields wants us to know that his depiction of urban despair gives \\"Heroes\\" a really deep quality, an allegorical feel. <br /> <br />The crowning indignity to \\"Heroes\\" is the actual book itself, including a banal, self-serving introduction by Ira Berkow.   It appears that the University of Nebraska Press simply photocopied the original but didn't check the quality of the reproduction. The paragraphs are often printed in different fonts and type sizes; many sentences are faint and nearly illegible.  Sadly, the very quality of the printing becomes its own metaphor for the novel.  \\"Heroes\\" is anything but, and serious students of sport's relationship to the American character would be well served to stay away from this disaster.	2005-03-17

While inspirational giants such as Martin Luther King, Jr., served as our national moral compass, anonymous men, women and children  --  some of whom would become martyrs to the cause of racial justice  --  transformed King's lofty rhetoric to concrete reality.  Their individual acts of  conscience placed them at enormous risk, yet they summoned, from the depths of their personal convictions, the courage to act on principled belief. <br /> <br />Naslund's novel interweaves the lives of the foot soldiers of the movement; she unflinchingly exposes their fears, ambivalences and doubts about personal valor, the efficacy of non-violence and the possibility of creating a society based on racial egalitarianism.  Each character has an integrity and a wholeness, a core set of values, which make them not only understandable to us, but believable.  \\"Four Spirits,\\" therefore, is a work that is much greater than the sum of its parts.  At its best, the novel is an evocation of the spirit of possibility that animated African-American and white men, women and children to sacrifice everything for an idea whose very nature exemplifies our national purpose.  As the characters grapple with their own demons, ranging from profound personal loss to serious character weakness, Naslund effects a gripping narrative of a city, Birmingham, Alabama, locked in the grip of the greatest social movement for change in the twentieth century. <br /> <br />Stella, who survived a horrific childhood automobile accident that claimed the lives of her family, describes herself as \\"somebody who wanted to change...to live more fully.\\"  She longs for a \\"broader\\" scope for her life and discovers it in the movement.  She befriends the wheelchair bound Cat Cartwright, who in turn finds the inner resolve to become a freedom fighter.  These two college-aged white women become colleagues with the defiant Christine, a single-mother of three, who eagerly seizes the opportunity to teach citizenship classes in the evening at an African-American college experimenting with an integrated staff.  Their leader, the charismatic Lionel Parish, unsuccessfully attempts to exorcise his sexual appetite while calmly exercising leadership under the most extreme circumstances.  All share an unspoken idealism; each discovers the strength to resist evil non-violently. <br /> <br />\\"Four Spirits\\" is far from a flawless work.  A talented writer, Naslund often permits her admiration of a neatly turned phrase to interfere with her narrative; the novel suffers tends to be overwritten.  Some pivotal characters, such as the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, have important roles early on and then inexplicably disappear.  Other characters, especially the nefarious Klansman Ryder Jones, are caricatures.  The semi-illiterate Jones, for example, not only violently abuses his wife but is a bungling bomber.  His evil is lessened by his abject stupidity.  Naslund also permits one of her characters (a child during the movement) to reflect on the early 1960s as an adult.  This unwelcomed change of tense disrupts the narrative and unfairly gives us access to only one character's subsequent evaluation of the period. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, \\"Four Spirits\\" demands attention.  Its uncompromising perception of racism and its equally stirring remembrance of uncommon courage remind readers that the genuine giants of the civil rights movement were regular citizens, who, for reasons both personal and political, felt as if the entire history of the nation would pivot on their actions.  Their linkage of thought and deed, of conscience and commitment, in Naslund's sure hands, are moving tributes to what the United States should be.	2005-03-13

This is a novel whose manifest belief in the innate goodness of human beings never wavers but is constantly tested, first by an artificial, illusory environment and subsequently by the characters' humbling self-doubt, and eroded sense of self-worth.  Through Brown's quiet but compelling narrative and her compelling depiction of the decent, conflicted characters who drive the story, \\"The Hatbox Baby\\" engages, informs and inspires.<br /><br />Set in the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago, the novel captures the contradictory, artificial and transitory qualities of an exposition which extols the possibilities of the future while existing in a city crippled by the ravages of the Great Depression.  Dr. Leo Hoffman, whose \\"infantorium\\" permits the paying public to gawk at premature babies whose only chance for life depends on his selfless commitment, is acutely aware of the fair's \\"tragic, doomed population of itinerants and freaks, its tricks of light.\\"  He is not deceived by \\"its furious, breakneck demonstration of scientific witness and victory.\\"  Despite its avowal of \\"progress,\\" the fair never answers Hoffman's unspoken, angry query:  \\"See?  See what we have accomplished?\\"  Though the fair's stated purpose is to extol applied science and technological possibilities, those who attend are invariably drawn to its more prosaic, seedier attractions.<br /><br />Hoffman's forsaken children share the same midway as exotic fan dancer, Caroline Day.  After men satisfy their erotic yearnings staring at the exquisitely-shaped Caroline, they may choose to balm their consciences by accompanying their women companions next door to stare at the silent, struggling sufferings of premature babies.  This discord between perverse observation and altruistic service, between the tawdry and the truly beautiful, between illusion and reality, resonates throughout the novel.<br /><br />Nowhere does the conflict between the grotesque and the transcendent rage with more fury than it does in the character of St. Louis, the misshapen semi-dwarf cousin of Caroline.  Abandoned by his own mother after a premature delivery, St. Louis (named after the city and not the saint) yearns to change his essential being.  \\"Could ugliness, the miserable state of the orphan, be cured?\\"  Childhood hopes for miraculous transformation inevitably fail, and St. Louis' \\"desperation for things to be made right\\" transform into \\"something small, which he swallowed like a tooth, its barbed root settling near his heart.\\"  His salvation is his cousin Caroline, who cares for him with authentic passion, but whose protection cannot assuage his yearnings for connection, hope and love.<br /><br />It is Brown's singular brilliance that permits the interplay between Dr. Hoffman, Caroline and St. Louis to attain symbolic significance.  Nor is it an unintended irony that in a fair where \\"the invisible energy of electricity\\" fills the air, where things are moved by \\"unseen forces\\" and \\"where everything was shown and yet nothing was revealed,\\" that the three central characters become alive to each other in ways unimaginable to them at the onset of the exposition.  \\"The Hatbox Baby\\" restores our faith in people because it reminds us that the greatest triumph humans can rightly claim is not the expansion of scientific knowledge but the uninhibited exaltation of our hearts.	2005-02-12

Is it best for a parent to forget a troubled past and shield her child from anguish or to assist the child in confronting something that could upset, alter or even destroy a parent-child relationship?  To what extent is the past never \\"the past,\\" but a continuous, immediate presence in our daily lives?  Margaret McMullan has attempted to answer these questions in her strong, sensitive and essential novel, \\"In My Mother's House,\\" a profound examination of the Holocaust on the second and third generation of survivors.  McMullan explores the Holocaust's resonant hurt and answers its unspoken questions through Elizabeth and her mother Jenny, the latter bent on denial and silence, the former wrestling with existential confusion, a tormented relationship with her mother and an unresolved identity. <br /> <br />\\"In My Mother's House\\" is permeated with what memoirist Fern Schumer Chapman, author of \\"Motherland,\\" concisely labels \\"the half-life of the Holocaust:\\" its silent, subtle and surreptitious grip on the children of survivors.   Jenny is a child escapee and daughter of an aloof, imperious Jewish father who converted to Catholicism as an adult and repudiated his ancestral heritage.  Now an assimilated American, she has produced a sensitive, questioning daughter who feels incomplete and adrift because of her lack of knowledge of her mother's past.  Elizabeth describes herself \\"immersed in death and memory,\\" but her self-definition accurately depicts her mother. <br /> <br />Mother and daughter face the vexing issues survivors and their children necessarily confront if there is to be any hope of family coherence and personal mental health.  Abandonment and denial.  Self-eradication and the legacy of loss.  Displacement and return.  Memory and connection.  As Elizabeth presses her mother for a full disclosure of the past and as Jenny steadfastly rebuffs her daughter's attempts to explore what the mother has walled off, both women risk having their hearts \\"tighten up\\" as though they were \\"hardened candy.\\" <br /> <br />At the onset of the novel, Elizabeth is unaware of her mother's past, presumably content with her present status as an American Catholic, newly relocated from Mississippi to Chicago's North Shore.  \\"My mother never spoke of the past.\\"  The child Elizabeth is aware that members of her family perished during World War II, but she \\"had to figure `the war' out on\\" her own.  Not illogically, she concludes that the \\"death camps were for Catholics, not Jews.\\" <br /> <br />While Jenny consciously obliterates any mention of the past, constructing an icy distance from her estranged father and, by inference, her family's past, Elizabeth unconsciously replicates her mother's pattern.  When her great grandmother regularly sends her pieces of tarnished silverware, the child hides them under her bed in a box, next to her grandfather's discarded autobiography, \\"which lies facedown...an arm's reach away.\\"  The dulled family heirlooms come to symbolize an obscured, painful history, too ugly to use but too precious to discard. <br /> <br />During Elizabeth's adolescence, her mother's obdurate silence crystallizes into an emphatic declaration:  \\"I swore no more questions about the past...about what was dead and gone.\\" Already conscious about her family's differences from their affluent, assimilated Midwestern neighbors, Elizabeth determines \\"that I would never ask another question about what was dead and gone.\\"  Her fear is that her \\"mother's past would run our little family.\\"  Yet denied history does not disappear, and as Elizabeth matures into adulthood, her unresolved appetite for historical authenticity gnaws at her; her resultant anorexia causes her body to disappear but her hunger for truth to grow. <br /> <br />Margaret McMullen's compassionate portrayal of Elizabeth's quest for identity resolves the question of an unresolved past, one which has poisoned Jenny's relationship with her father, one which has fractured her deep but injurious love for Elizabeth and one which has made Elizabeth incapable of giving and receiving love.  Elizabeth's decision to seek out her Jewish roots matches her mother's commitment to eradicate them.   Both derive from ruined history, denial and the consequences of self-eradication. <br /> <br />Increasingly, as the living voices of survivors become fewer in number, we will come to depend on their children to assist us in understanding the implications of the Holocaust.  \\"In My Mother's House\\" illuminates the pivotal issue of identity formation in the shadow of the Holocaust through a mother-daughter relationship.  Both Jenny and Elizabeth face each other and their distinct, but intertwined, histories.  They come to grips with their own emotional landscape of exile, recrimination and separation, and in so doing, the two try to navigate their way out of diaspora.	2005-01-11

Wolff's determination to idealize the seemingly insurmountable difficulties a writer must confront and overcome cannot hide the fact that his protagonist doesn't live in the same world as most of us.  Ashamed of his semi-pariah status at an isolated, elitist, eastern prep school, ambivalent over his quasi-Jewish identity and alarmed at the level he will stoop to win a literary contest, Wolff's protagonist will appeal to a very limited audience.  Both the protagonist and the novel lack authenticity, the real sweat and mess of daily life.  Consequently, \\"Old School\\" is itself elitist and aloof, appealing only to those who swoon to the oh-so-awful quandaries \\"real\\" artists alone understand.<br /><br />There is no disgrace for young men (and make no mistake about it, \\"Old School\\" from front cover to last page is a book solely about men) to love literature.  Nor is there anything wrong for aspiring writers to compete for a private audience with the leading literary lights of the early 1960s.  To speak with Robert Frost, Ayn Rand or Ernest Hemingway is no small prize.  However, the button-downed characters who flit their way through the novel lack depth and genuine character.  Even the scholarship students are a cut above everyone else; their problems, as serious as they seem to themselves, are, in the large scope of things, frivolous.<br /><br />By the time the protagonist fritters his time away, invariably postponing writing and agonizing about theme, form and worth of each submission, \\"Old School\\" loses steam.  Wolff could have selected any number of issues to develop:  an assimilated Jew's ambivalence over identity, what competition does to decent people, how a small, self-contained culture can both exalt and degrade personality.  Instead, just as Shakespeare's Romeo loved being in love more than love itself, Wolff rhapsodizes over what the life of the writer is rather than writing itself.  The result is a desiccated sentimentalism, an arid mawkishness.<br /><br />\\"Old School\\" does contain several moments of light.  Wolff's depiction of Robert Frost humanizes the poet and convinces even the most hard-hearted that poetic form matters.  The protagonist's introduction to the complicated nature of adult sexuality and ambition gives wholeness to his teachers.  His friend's capitulation to attending chapel instead of holding true to principle reminds us that even the best of the quiet rebels of the early 1960s had feet of clay.<br /><br />Several strong moments do not rescue the novel.  Women are either way over the top (Ayn Rand is more caricature than character) or foils to the protagonist's moral evolution. Wolff's nostalgia over prep school life cannot disguise an arrogant elitism and a frightening presumptiveness that this type of education is superior to public education.

Written as part of the Crown Journeys series, his \\"Never a City So Real\\" celebrates the vitality, integrity and diversity of the city through discreet narratives of its people.  Kotlowitz avoids both the familiar and the clich about Chicago, instead focusing on a set of characters who capture the \\"flesh and bone...the lifeblood\\" of the city.  Possessing \\"passion and hustle,\\" the relatively unheralded Chicagoans whom Kotlowitz focuses attention personify the city with their grit, honesty and succinct energy.    It is unsurprising, therefore, that the fist person the author uses to symbolize Chicago is his father-in-law, Jack Woltjen, whose talents, vision and intensity emerge as larger-than-life.  Part huckster, part social egalitarian, Woltjen has the \\"passion and hustle\\" Chicago extols as virtues.  Kotlowitz understands why Woltjen was \\"celebrated\\" in Chicago; his \\"entrepreneurial spirit and his unwavering belief in himself\\" not only persuades others of his worth but transforms the very city that provides him the opportunity to live.  Iconoclastic (he doctors paintings of the masters), indignant (he exposes police brutality against the Black Panthers) and idealistic (he serves as an agent for the integration of segregated neighborhoods), Woltjen embodies Chicago's penchant for contradictions.  Even a sculpture in his backyard captures a \\"beautiful juxtaposition of power and fragility.\\"    Mocked by a \\"New Yorker\\" columnist as \\"the Second City,\\" Chicago unabashedly refused offense.  Eventually, the city's fabled comedy troupe adopts the name.  Its geographic location resulted in Chicago's emergence as a center of commerce and a magnet for the \\"cascade of immigrant groups\\" which now call it home.  Its physical insularity, separated from self-aggrandizing New York and the glitz of Los Angeles by half a continent, gives Chicago its own opportunity for self-definition, creation and perpetuation.    Kotlowitz consciously selects artists who are either underappreciated or invisible; he portrays men and women who open not only businesses but their hearts to those who are barely getting by.  Even his constant reference to Nelson Algren, \\"himself a bar of discordant notes,\\" reminds us that Chicago often does not recognize its own greatness.  It is \\"an imperfect place,\\" but \\"Chicago is America's city; it dreams America's dream.\\"  We learn of \\"Oil Can\\" Eddie Sadlowski, union man who still inspires with his own life's history.  We dine with Millie Wortham and Brenda Stephenson, upbeat and optimistic despite working with the most desperate and destitute of Chicago's poor.  We learn to bow our own heads down in the presence of the irascible but compassionate Ramazan Celikoski, who runs a hole-in-the-wall diner where \\"the world intersects...on the city's northwest side.\\"    Visitors to Chicago will still clutch their maps and travelogues.  Those who want to understand the city will cherish Alex Kotlowitz' \\"Never a City So Real.\\"  This slim, beautifully written description of Chicago permits its readers not only to understand the city but to love it as well.	2004-12-21

Ray's poetic prose is part autobiography, part self-identification with place and part manifesto.  Her writing soars with exquisite metaphor and astounding revelation.  She is unapologetic in her defense of the longleaf pine ecosystem and convincing in her appeals for Americans to redefine the very nature of our national character.  \\"Wild Card Quilt\\" required courage to write, and Ray more than met the challenge.  Years from now, she will be recognized as instrumental to late twentieth-century ecology as Rachel Carson was some half-century earlier. <br /> <br />After having fled her restrictive and repressive childhood home in rural Georgia, Ray discovers herself adrift and alienated as an adult.  A single mother of an inquisitive and sensitive son, her spiritual restlessness compels her to return to her grandmother's isolated shotgun cabin and reclaim her life.  In so doing, she rediscovers her fervent, but latent, identification with the disappearing longleaf pine forests of the Southeast.  As she had in \\"Cracker Childhood,\\" Ray provides masterful descriptions of this endangered ecology, lavishing as much love on the richly interdependent plant and animal life as she does on the family and community with which she interlaces herself in Baxley, Georgia. <br /> <br />Firmly linking herself with those social critics of American life who decry our culture's obsession with consumption and lack of identification with nature, Ray agrees with Paul Gruchow's conclusion that \\"we raise our most capable rural children...to expect that as soon as possible they will leave.\\"  Against this diaspora, Ray launches numerous campaigns, not only to preserve the ecology of her home, but the social structure groaning under the pressures of eradication in the name of jobs, progress and consumption. <br /> <br />As moving as her political polemics are,  Ray reserves her best writing in portraying her people.  Likening her family to homemade pure cane syrup, Ray surmises, \\"It's sweetness that keeps people together.  Sweetness.  The sweetness of our tongues, of kind words, of praise.\\"  But not only that.  It is also the \\"sweetness, too, of acts of imagination and love.\\"  Quiet, nearly invisible kin earn her respect.  Her reclusive uncle Percy, \\"not a man to reach out...or...demand much from life,\\" through Ray's characterization, gains enormous dignity from his modesty.  Percy, who excels at attending church and mowing the lawn, is as \\"extreme in his quiescence as Hemingway had been in his ardor to eat life's marrow.\\"  Content to allow life to come to him,  \\"Percy nibbled at the crust.\\" <br /> <br />From her mother, whose labors produce the quilt which gives the memoir its title, arises a sense of beauty that fits with Ray's defense of rural life.  Her mother's quilts originate from \\"necessity, using rags and torn clothes.\\"  To Ray, \\"the need for usefulness...produces objects of the greatest beauty.\\"  The adult Ray has a kinder, more forgiving understanding of her father's psychology.  Never giving in to his rigidity, she forgives him, and in so doing, opens the door for his reconciliation with Ray's oldest sister, with whom he had been estranged for nearly two decades. <br /> <br />Towering above everything in \\"Wild Card Quilt\\" is Janisse Ray's unabashed sense of hope.  This infectious optimism, infused with deep conviction and enormous compassion, may align itself with our nation's longstanding sense of hope and vision.  As the author becomes increasingly integrated in her Baxley environment, as she becomes ever more passionate in her advocacy for the longleaf pine forests, as she plants her own taproot deep in the fertile soils of family love and community solidarity, she outlines not only a personal blueprint of redemption, but a national one as well.	2004-12-20

This is a novel whose exploration of thwarted identities, derailed love and resolute commitments reminds us that the center of our attention need not be on glamorous cities like New York or Los Angeles, but in small, unremarkable towns like Kerrville, Kansas.  There, under the sure-handed guidance of Ms. Moriarty, the reader discovers the genuine underpinnings of family, romantic longing and resolve. <br /> <br />At first glance, the protagonist of \\"Center,\\" Evelyn Bucknow has little hope of bucking the odds of a dreary life.  Her mother, bitterly estranged from her father, has never been forgiven by him for giving birth to Evelyn out of wedlock.  Although Evelyn cannot understand why her grandfather refers to her mother Tina as a \\"horse,\\" Tina well understands the sexual aspersion embedded in that derogatory condemnation.  Compounding her life's downward spiral, Tina becomes pregnant, fails a welfare interview and seems destined to be imprisoned by both material and spiritual poverty. <br /> <br />Yet it is Evelyn's tenacity, resiliency and capacity to endure setbacks which set the tone for the novel.  Evelyn refuses to accept the sterile vastness of the Kansas landscape as the metaphor of her life.  She rebels in ways that surprise and validate her growing independence and frustration with a compromised life.  And in her rebellion, she grows as a young woman.  Early adolescent answers spawn questions; certaintiesproduce doubts.  Her stunted living environment ironically compels her to open her mind; she finds liberation in school while those closest to her  --  her tragically stagnating mother, her religiously rigid grandmother, her sexually precocious friend  --  slowly grasp the consequences of marginalizing the mind.   <br /> <br />Evelyn's idiosyncrasies humanize her.  Her unrequited romantic longings, her immersion and emergence as a born-again Christian, her repudiation, reconsideration reconnection with her mother reveal a young woman who is not just frustrated by contradictions, but liberated by them.  Against her own wishes, she emerges larger than life. <br /> <br />Flavored by realistic dialogue, marked by sensitive characterization and enhanced by realistic portraits of single motherhood, small-town disillusion and family friction, \\"The Center of Everything\\" signals the emergence of Laura Moriarty as a voice to be honored.	2004-12-07
US	50747195	R334MGPJM7I0RC	0312423241	742843186	The Romantic: A Novel	Books	3	4	8	N	N	unaffecting "Romantic" limps to sappy predictable conclusion	By the time Barbara Gowdy drags readers through some three hundred pages of overwrought prose, she has long since wrung out every conceivable drop of sympathy we may have produced for her hapless protagonist, Louise Kirk.  Dealt the unspeakable cruelty of childhood abandonment by her beautiful, remote mother, Louise never recovers, instead squandering her life on unrequited love.   <br /> <br />Louise initially transfers her need for affirmation to an exotic neighbor who is the mother of an orphaned son, Abel; soon thereafter, Louise predictably falls in love with him.  The quiet, introspective and excessively sensitive Abel never reciprocates, instead dangling crumbs of affection to the romantically-challenged Louise.  Her unreciprocated love becomes the focus of this ill-paced, poorly integrated novel. <br /> <br />It doesn't take long to figure out that all will probably not end well for either Louise or Abel.  Neither is a particularly compelling character; both have numerous unaddressed flaws.  Instead of examining these character weaknesses, the author inexplicably has chosen to tell the story from three distinct tenses, the result of which causes the reader to know demise without reason, destruction without understanding.  Just when one narrative strand captures attention, Gowdy abandons it for another.  The result is an unsatisfying patchwork of a book, pretty from the outside, but insubstantial, much like bricks made without straw. <br /> <br />What is most disappointing is that Gowdy is a good writer who somehow became enamored with a shopworn theme and a distinctly unsatisfying means of explaining it.  Those strong enough to endure countless pages of female weepiness, lassitude and submissiveness to fate will delight in Louise's character.  Most of us will have long since forgotten the novel's powerful beginning and have screamed, many times over, for Louise to get a grip on her life. <br /> <br />Gowdy's initial pages, which explore the relationship between Louise and her icy Grace, are compelling and authentic.  To be made insecure by a parent is one of the greatest hurts a child could experience.  Grace's chiseled beauty and her manifest discomfort with marriage and motherhood inflict more than insecurity on Louise.  The insecure child idolizes and fears her mother, and the subsequent abandonment on the child by itself would have made a powerful book. <br /> <br />Grace's squawk-like laugher, a \\"laugh that can shatter glass,\\" matches her ability to hurt Louise.  Though the mother soothes criticism of her daughter with indirect praise, Grace also \\"often dulled praise with an indirect wound.\\"  It is no accident that an already insecure child grows up to be a woman with little or no hope.  Gowdy never seizes the opportunity to reflect on the child's loss, and this lack of sympathetic analysis results in a sadly unaffecting presentation of the legacy of loss. <br /> <br />\\"The Romantic\\" never lives up to its possibilities or its author's talents.  Characters who ought to have been more fully developed, particularly Louise's diligent, betrayed father, fall of the pages.  A story which ought have been told directly meanders through different time and spatial zones, leaving the reader exhausted and, even worse, disinterested.  Beautifully turned phrases remind the reader of Barbara Gowdy's talent but only tease our emotional appetite, delicious psychological appetizers without a substantial meal.	2004-11-20
US	50747195	R280C6SBI1TFNG	1400030536	226199242	The Clearing: A Novel	Books	5	21	22	N	N	brothers battle geography, memory and evil in bayou epic	In Tim Gautreaux' spellbinding novel, \\"The Clearing,\\" Randolph Aldridge sets out to locate and reclaim his shell-shocked and spiritually lost older brother, Byron.  Randolph's odyssey takes him not only to the most remote, primitive and violent region of Louisiana bayou virgin forest, but to the extremities of human nature as well.  Randolph, the lumber mill manager, confronts an untouched geographic environment and must also face his worst fears:  the primitive qualities of the human heart, an unalloyed fear of death, and his own capacity to comprehend vengeance and to exact it.  In its exploration of the consequences of war, of good people's need to be just in the face of withering evil and of the human heart's capacity to love, \\"The Gathering\\" is nothing less than brilliant. <br /> <br />In search of meaning and purpose, Randolph and Byron are equally lost souls.  As the younger brother, Randolph struggles with his place in the family, and he chafes at his subterranean disappointment with his life.  His acceptance of his father's demand that he discover the whereabouts of his older brother and be the means of his brother's redemption presents an opportunity to not only discover the definition of manhood, but to become one on his own terms.  Randolph's actions, which ultimately involve his own liberation, create a genuine interdependence with Byron. <br /> <br />It is Byron's existential despair that gives the novel its power.  Ruined by the degradations of World War I, Byron has consciously sought to efface himself from his family and the nation which precipitated his emotional ruin.  After reluctantly recounting but one horrific episode of his experiences in the trenches, Byron \\"stared down...and his face seemed like something carved by wind out of the side of a mountain.\\"  As a representative of the \\"Lost Generation,\\" it is not surprising that Byron has chosen to enforce law and order on a population that, in Gautreaux' capable hands, appears incapable of civilized behavior.   As a lawman, Byron's justice is swift, calculated and brutal.  He offers no apologies but is fully aware of the human toll his work exacts. <br /> <br />As events spiral out of control in the \\"The Clearing,\\" Gautreaux requires his readers to consider whether good men can overcome the antagonistic influences of geography,  post-trauma distress and humans' ability to inflict pain, suffering and disgrace on each other.  The novel's deterministic fatalism contrasts sharply with the brothers' understated heroism, and it is this tension between light and dark, degradation and realization that makes the novel a riveting read. <br /> <br />We face the \\"jaundiced anger\\" of battle-scarred World War I veterans and realize it is only the most delicate of lines which makes one man an amoral, vicious killer and another a despairing, driven lawman.  Descriptions of the Louisiana cypress bayou are so meticulous and forbidding that we sweat sympathetically and our hearts palpitate in fear of primordial insects, snakes and alligators.  Even those of us committed to non-violence may experience a diminution of belief as Randolph and Byron use whatever means necessary to prevail. <br /> <br />At once a powerful narrative and metaphorical allegory, Tim Gautreaux' \\"The Clearing\\" reminds us that our best writers squeeze our national character and wring out its essence.  Whether his characters are debased or admirable, Gautreaux distills something vital from each.  Through his exploration of family, justice and memory, he has given us a true picture of ourselves.	2004-11-07

When Lederer focuses on family relationships, her memoir is worthy of a raise; when she rhapsodizes about poker, she is trying to win the pot with a hand that should have been folded after the flop.  Either way, we've been suckered to complete a book that should have been little more than an extended magazine piece. <br /> <br />Lederer unearths a fascinating, fractious family, one which consists of an alcoholic mother who yearns to act, a three-hundred pound vegan brother who excels as a gambler, a combative older sister who vaults into the big leagues of Las Vegas wagering and a literate father who toils anonymously as a teacher in an Eastern prep school before becoming a best-selling author.  The youngest child in this menagerie, Katy recognizes games as the sole glue cementing her family.  She never quite discovers what motivates her peripatetic wanderings, either physically or emotionally.  In her life, she is an indifferent student then a grade-obsessed one; she gains employment in professions which capitalize on her obsessive qualities and dabbles herself in the harsh realities of professional poker.  Nowhere is there an attachment to any one person, any one idea. <br /> <br />It is this detachment, however, which could have made her a talented Hold-'Em player.  Her brother, sister and mother, all of whom eventually call Las Vegas home do not connect; instead they intersect, and none too gracefully.  On the cusp of illegal activities, they make big bank, spend it frivolously and lead sterile lives.  Aside from the adrenaline rush that poker produces, this is no kind of life for a poet, which, we find, Lederer eventually becomes. <br /> <br />If gambling is a zero-sum game, if for every winner there are numerous losers  and if winning requires a dispassionate empathy (as the author so obliquely observes), then \\"Poker Face\\" is a perfect metaphor for the pastime Katy Lederer sets out to describe.  She invites us to the table, notices our every weakness, makes us believe she has something far better than what we hold in our own hand and then takes us for all we're worth.	2004-10-20
US	50747195	R2VYJYYNXPHFNM	1400032113	615727843	Family History: A Novel	Books	5	6	7	N	Y	Shapiro's full talents emerge in subtle, compelling account	In earlier works, Dani Shapiro revealed glimpses of brilliance in her exploration of the complex tensions that either sunder or fortify family relationships.  \\"Family History, a novel that compassionately exposes a family unraveling under the most extreme circumstances, is a masterwork.  Subtle, unsettling and compelling, Shapiro's treatment of family crisis, adolescent confusion and personal reclamation entices, ensnares and enmeshes the reader.  It is proof that an author can create a work of art that is deserves the largest audience without compromising the integrity of her craft.  This novel signals Shapiro's triumphant emergence as an important interpreter of contemporary American life. <br /> <br />Through the eyes of her protagonist Rachel Jensen, Shapiro beckons us to enter the word of \\"otherness,\\" where there exists a radical deviation from the normal, sustaining  routines which compose many family histories.  To Rachel, things that previously brought delight now \\"feel like a slap in the face\\" by people who \\"have not been swallowed up whole by the earth.\\"  Rachel asks, \\"How many women...have watched their world shatter...as if it were a glass globe?\\"  How many marriages have seen the fissures of doubt become chasms of mistrust and disbelief?  How many children, previously the source of life in the fabric of a family, have become unknowing perpetrators of unfixable destruction? <br /> <br />It is not only Kate Jensen, the anguished daughter of devoted parents Ned and Rachel, who is constricted in a \\"tourniquet of anger and guilt.\\"  A tragic accident involving Kate's infant brother sends the Jensen family into a vortex of familial disintegration.  The Jensens face internal and external pressures; if it is not the explosive impact of Kate's assignation of responsibility, then it is the implosive consequences of guilt, remorse and doubt that ravage the once cohesive family.  As their youngest son, Josh, recovers tentatively from his accident, Shapiro gives us no such assurances that Ned and Rachel will. <br /> <br />Reading \\"Family Life\\" is like navigating a fragile vessel through iceberg-strewn waters.  Not only are there surface obstacles to overcome, beneath the surface loom huge dangers, most unknown, not only to the reader, but to Ned and Rachel as well.  As do Ned and Rachel, we know something significant, something terribly altering, as occurred to their daughter during a summer stay at camp.  But what was it?  Is their daughter just in a transitory phase of adolescent angst or has something more ominous, more calamitous happened to her?  Through Rachel's eyes, we witness the disappearance of trust, hope and love and wonder if they can ever be recaptured.  To whom does a mother owe allegiance in a time of unprecedented crisis:  her daughter or her husband?  Are doubt and questioning the same things as disloyalty and disbelief?   <br /> <br />If these questions are not absorbing enough, Shapiro also forces us to examine our own assumptions about family coherence.  Is happiness illusory; can the Jensens capture what they once appeared to possess as a birthright?  Is personal redemption worth the cost if the price is losing a husband or a daughter?  How many of us have Solomonic wisdom regarding our own children; how much of their internal lives are unknown to us? <br /> <br />Cross-cutting narratives, enhanced by exquisite dialogue, give \\"Family History\\" enormous momentum.  Shapiro never relinquishes her hold on us, never provides the easy answer, never permits her characters to become clichs.  Instead, this magnificent writer prefers complexities to certainties, subtleties to the obvious, the unspoken to the said.  The result is a novel of incredible psychological power, emotional intensity and moral integrity.	2004-10-19
US	50747195	R1HGLS3VCIF5UB	0385721323	513080584	In the River Sweet	Books	2	6	12	N	Y	dreary, banal and pretentious, "River" runs dry quickly	It would take quite an effort to make the legacy of the Vietnam War, the consequences of withholding secrets from a spouse and the impact of reuniting with a child after some thirty years of separation uninspiring and boring.  Not only does National Book Award finality Patricia Henley do that in her terminally stultifying \\"In the River Sweet,\\" she does so with a style that deliberately bedevils her readers.  Overwritten, unnecessarily atmospheric and banal, her novel fails in every task she set for it to achieve. <br /> <br />On the surface, the dilemmas faced by Ruth Anne Bond compel interest and engagement.  She breaks away from her tyrannical aunt and journeys to Vietnam in the late 1960s to be with her loving fiance only to discover that he is missing in action.  An innocent relationship with a blind Vietnamese man results in a pregnancy and a subsequent giving up of her newborn son.  Years later, these events, as they invariably do, come back to haunt her.  \\"In the River Sweet\\" never makes up its mind as to how to develop the important themes of legacy, love and family. <br /> <br />Instead, Henley prefers labored paragraphs detailing the interminable confusions and ambivalences Ruth Anne experiences.  Predictably, she withdraws from her devoted husband, Johnny, who, in turn, is frustrated by his inability to reach the woman to whom he has devoted his life.   Mired in religious angst  --  naturally enough, Ruth Anne retreats to a Catholic convent where the nuns neatly incorporate Buddhist meditation into their theology  --  Ruth Anne spends nearly one hundred pages wondering if she should respond to a computer salutation from her long-abandoned son, who, it goes without saying, now lives in a neighboring city. <br /> <br />If this potboiler treatment of serious issues isn't bad enough, the book is a stylistic disaster.  Henley has chosen to eschew all punctuation in her dialogue, making the reader work to merely decode her inept use of dialogue.  Why do authorsrefuse to adhere to the conventions of written English?  Does Henley think that \\"River\\" becomes more of a work of art by eliminating quotation marks?   By forcing readers to spend their energy on simply understanding her prose, Henley only proves her own pretentiousness. <br /> <br />Finishing \\"In the River Sweet\\" requires one to wade through nearly three-hundred pages of under-edited, overripe writing.  Those who desire an understanding of the consequences of the Vietnam War would be better served by speaking directly to a Vietnam vet or visiting the Wall in Washington, D.C.   Patricia Henley's greatest transgression against that divisive and still-upsetting war is to make it boring and trivial.  Those who experienced it directly and who still suffer its legacy deserve much, much more than what she delivers.	2004-10-09
US	50747195	RRMO1RX7MHKT4	0375759875	486476742	Our Father Who Art in a Tree: A Novel	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	sensitive and symbolic "Our Father" explores father's death	In ways wise, sensitive and true, Australian author Judy Pascoe explores the impact of a father's premature death on a family in her elegant debut novel, \\"Our Father Who Art in a Tree.\\"  Perceived through the eyes of ten-year-old Simone O'Neill, the process of mourning and rededication to life is invested with imagination, determination and hope.  Pascoe's characters not only wrestle with loss; they struggle with legacy, despair and abandonment.  It is Simone's vision and voice that elevate the themes and energize the narrative. <br /> <br />Simone's discovery of her deceased father's presence in a huge, untamed tree adjacent to her house both astonishes and empowers her.  Against her instincts, she shares this startling discovery with her mother, who instead of mocking her child's epiphany investigates it.  As Simone's mother communes with her departed spouse, the child battles against feelings of betrayal, jealousy and anger.   Simone describes her mother's grief as \\"a monologue she could unload onto anyone\\" while the children paradoxically suffer from the mother's \\"broken dam of grief,\\" preferring to express itself in \\"explosive arguments.\\" <br /> <br />It is the tree that gains symbolic presence, serving not only as the spiritual home of her father but as an ever-present reminder that death is not final, that Simone's father can refract and distort events.  Soon after Simone's mother decides to reacquaint herself romantically with another man, a large branch of the tree crashes through the bedroom window.  The appearance of a tree branch in her mother's bed elicits Simone's initial awareness that sex and loss embrace her mother.  This abrupt, shocking realization angers Simone, and \\"this thing called sex...that had to do with beds and men and women...\\" empowers her father \\"to assert his claim over my mother\\" in a \\"touching\\" fashion. <br /> <br />The triumph of \\"Our Father\\" is the author's belief in the capacity of the heart to heal itself.  Rarely does a child protagonist possess such reflective abilities, and Simone's ability to discern differing means of mourning (her older brother's self-induced exile behind books, her mother's willingness to allow the house to decline, her own need for imagination) permits her to not only respect distinct patterns of sadness but to learn from them.  As the novel builds in tension and the family faces a physical crisis laden with psychological consequences, Simone grows in self-awareness, tolerance and hope. <br /> <br />Not only does \\"Our Father Who Art in a Tree\\" feature a powerful narrative, a stunning climax and a convincing denouement, it does so through an unpretentious voice, one that is at once authentic and compassionate.  Judy Pascoe's investigation of the legacy of loss, its enduring scars and its resultant healing, provides hope...for those who have not only suffered the ravages of death but for those who may have abandoned hope in life.   <br /> <br />	2004-09-30
US	50747195	R4LQCAISRPH7B	080214151X	758410541	Triangle: The Fire That Changed America	Books	5	7	8	N	N	"Triangle" fires historical imagination, indignation	Incendiary disasters grab headlines.  The sight and sound of humans consumed by fire horrify onlookers; the profound shock of loss often compels introspection, investigation and response.  Just as the United States underwent such a process in the fall of 2001, so did New York in the spring of 1911 when 146 employees of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory perished in a ghastly inferno on the eighth, ninth and tenth floors of the Asch Building.  David Von Drehle's account of that fire  --  of its causes, its victims, its consequences  --  \\"Triangle,\\" is social history at its best.  Meticulous in detail, riveting in its narrative and perceptive in its analysis, \\"Triangle\\" captures the reader's attention from its first paragraph and never lets go. <br /> <br />This human-caused catastrophe reflects the wrenching social changes occurring in the United States at the onset of the twentieth century.  Von Drehle deftly interweaves feminism, immigration, industrialization, and progressivism in his analysis of the Triangle fire.  Events as disparate as the explosion of Mt. Vesuvius and pogroms in the Pale of Settlement in Russia find a place in his explanation as to how the Triangle workers found their way to New York.  Readers experience steerage, sweatshop conditions and the tang of New York immigrant life as Von Drehle humanizes the victims.  At the same time, he presents an unbiased picture of the two owners of the factory; their cupidity rivals their ambition and their own immigrant backgrounds reflect and refract the American drive for success. <br /> <br />The single greatest strength of \\"Triangle\\" is Von Drehle's talented depiction of the significant men and women whose arrogance and idealism, courage and cowardice, ambition and altruism clash throughout the narrative.  We meet gutsy Clara Lemlich, a Russian Jewish immigrant who is so devoted to economic justice that she continues her organizing and exhortations despite being brutally beaten by goons hired by the bosses.Charles F. Murphy, Tammany Hall's feared boss, becomes the agent through which the Democratic Party transforms itself into the voice of urban liberalism.  Max D. Steuer, himself a former garment-shop worker, gains legendary status as the attorney whose brilliant cross-examination of a bewildered survivor results in the acquittal of the beleaguered factory owners. <br /> <br />It was not just a locked door that caused the death of over 140 workers.  David Von Drehle accurately ascribes responsibility to an inert New York City political bureaucracy that tacitly encouraged factory owners to build deathtraps disguised as places of employment.  The Triangle fire occurred at a time when unions were struggling to find their place, when the police were in the pockets of industrialists, when women were politically voiceless.  \\"Triangle\\" serves to remind us that disaster lurks whenever the drive for profit overwhelms the need to protect the powerless.  This sensitive, comprehensive and inspiring social history admonishes, instructs and inspires.	2004-09-25
US	50747195	R3J3W8QVJXBG8U	0440242002	430694437	Bleachers	Books	3	2	2	N	Y	"Bleachers" is little better than second-string melodrama	Despondent and adrift, former high-school All-American football star Neely Crenshaw returns to his childhood home to grieve  --  for his terminally ill coach, lost dreams and an adult life of frustration, futility and fear.   It's hard not to feel for Neely, and John Grisham trots out every convention to enlist the reader in the star's legion of fans.  \\"Bleachers\\" is an effective, sensitive and tidy portrait of the impact of high-school football on the men who played the game and an examination of the enduring legacy of a coach who inspired loathing and love in his players.  The novel is also melodramatic, predictable and manipulative, and instead of a being a genuinely moving tribute to a coach's undying presence, \\"Bleachers\\" meanders in familiar territory, forfeiting integrity for clichs.   <br /> <br />Before there was Neely Crenshaw, there was Chip Hilton, whose wholesome exploits on the athletic field made him an icon for the Baby Boomer generation.  Hilton's coach was a genuine role model, never compromising his athletes' need for authentic validation to the altar of victory.  In turn, Hilton's inevitable victories comforted readers who needed assurance that right prevails, honor is worth the effort and adult role models exist in America's high schools. <br /> <br />Crenshaw's Coach Rake is a complicated but flawed man, driven to win, devoted to excellence, and inflexible in his insistence on practice, execution and fearless performance.  His former players never seem to grow up, suspended in memory, frozen on the picture-perfect gridiron of Messina High School.  As stereotyped as Chip Hilton was in the 1960s, Neely Crenshaw is even less complicated.  His angst is tiresome, his hidden secrets obvious.  Even before Coach Rake dies, we know his players will revisit the past, confront their ghosts and come out of the valley of death ennobled. <br /> <br />What makes this pat formula work is Grisham's gift with dialogue.  Neely confronts teammates (one a model ofmiddle-class stability, one an inmate, one gay) as well as his spurned former girl-friend with a combination of stoic pain and courageous determination.  Through this gentle odyssey, we watch a grown man truly become a functional adult.  But the observations require us to wade through saccharine vignettes, absolutely contrived conversations and stereotyped characters. <br /> <br />In the most painful sense, Grisham is preaching to the choir.  Those who are less than enthralled with football or who are aware of its limits will find \\"Bleachers\\" effective propaganda but inadequate literature.  Those who have played the game, who constantly relive their pasts and faithfully advocate the sport as the salvation of our society will sleep with the novel under their pillows.	2004-09-23

Hector St. Jean de Crevecoeur's thesis was that the American is a \\"new man,\\" one who eagerly discarded the cultural traditions of his former home and just as passionately adopted the ethos of his newly adopted land, the United States.  The American, de Crevecoeur, discards his former cultural heritage and completely \\"melts\\" into his new American charcter.  It is the perils, costs and anguish of assimilation that Bengali author Jhumpa Lahiri explores in her brilliant debut novel, \\"The Namesake.\\"   Her exquisitely rendered protagonist, Gogol Ganguli, becomes the archtype for every immigrant who has wrestled with issues of conflicted identity, cultural confusion and humbling marginality. <br /> <br />Through Lahiri's wise and sympathetic characterization, Gogol begins his odyssey towards Americanization even before he is born.  His Bengali immigrant parents, whose marriage was arranged by their adherence to cultural tradition, cannot provide a proper name for their American-born son.  Their patient but unrewarded anticipation of a \\"good\\" name for their son selected by a Calcutta matriarch, results in Gogol inadvertently acquiring a \\"pet\\" name chosen by his father.  This duality, between Gogol's ethnic roots and his American birthright, perpetually torments him. <br /> <br />Befuddlement, confusion and anger over unresolved identity occurs with dispiriting regularity across the span of Gogol's young life.  Even at a traditional Bengali party celebrating his six-month-old status, the infant Gogol, \\"forced to confront his destiny,\\" cannot and \\"with lower lip trembling,\\" begins to cry.  Ashima and Ashoke, his mother and father, wrestle as well with the burdens of adopting to a new nation.  His father seems to assimilate with relative ease, but Ashima likens her immigrant status to a \\"sort of lifelong pregnancy...a perpetual wait, a constant burden.\\" <br /> <br />As a junior high school student, Gogol loathes his name, despondent that it is \\"never on keychains.\\"  Conscious of his differences, he is hurt by the snickers his parents' accent evokes from store clerks.  By actions conscious and unintended, Gogol immerses himself in the American melting pot.  It is not an accident that by the time he is an adult, he will live in New York City, a refracted image of \\"How the Other Half Lives,\\" affluent but disenchanted, externally successful but internally impoverished. <br /> <br />Jhumpa Lahiri seems to understand the enormous costs abandoning one's  ethnic identity carry for immigrants who desire nothing more than to blend in.  Her Bengali protagonist, acutely aware of his differences but unable to resolve his dual identities, comes to symbolize the anguished decisions all young immigrants must make as they carve out their paths towards becoming American.  \\"The Namesake,\\" in its treatment of individual growth, romantic possibilities and generational reconciliation, is an authentic masterwork.	2004-09-12

Should its members seek to forget and minimize the trauma caused by sudden loss?  How can those who suffer from guilt face those who have rage boiling beneath an appearance of acceptance?  Ursula Hegi tackles these issues in her compelling and important novel, \\"Sacred Time,\\" a work which tracks one family's journey through fifty years of suppressed mourning, recrimination and remorse.   <br /> <br />Hegi is at her best when she focuses on Anthony Amedeo, who is at the epicenter of tremors unleashed by a fatal accident which he innocently abetted during his Bronx childhood.  \\"Marked and isolated\\" by his involvement in the accident, suffused with \\"dread and fear,\\" Anthony's life has been marked by his conscious repudiation of wants.  He has concluded that his childhood desire  --  for his own space, his own toys, his own personality  --  has caused his family to fracture.  Confiding to his estranged wife as an adult, Anthony's characterization of himself as \\"the devil\\" encapsulates his self-hatred, his suspicion that life offers little to hope for and much to be afraid of. <br /> <br />The loss of his cousin is \\"one huge ripple  --  a tidal wave, rather\\" that \\"seized\\" all the members of his family and \\"flung\\" them into a territory where there is \\"no common focus, only conflicting angles of vision, colliding and aligning\\" in a \\"chaotic mosaic.\\"  Marraiges crumble; silences replace language, and the children affected by the tragedy struggle to regain their bearings.  Anthony's cousin Belinda is haunted by the absence of her twin sister, and it is with great difficulty that she emerges as an intact adult. <br /> <br />Hegi is masterful in her recreation of the Bronx during the McCarthy scare of the early 1950s.  Her use of dialogue advances a crisp narrative, and she seems to have a genuinely compassionate sensitivity for the life of a child whose dreams are altered firstby family circumstances and then by tragedy.  Anthony's mother, Leonora, is by far the most complicated and satisfying of the adult characters of the novel. <br /> <br />Less convincing is the author's treatment of Anthony's aunt Floria.  Over one-third of the novel explores her psychological metamorphosis, and much of that simply doesn't work.  Floria's extended stay in Italy devolves into maudlin melodrama; her death is depicted in a quasi-Joycean stream of consciousness that is contrived and predictable.  Hegi doesn't seem to realize that the greatest strength of \\"Sacred Time\\" is its treatment of serious emotional questions through a powerful narrative.  When she overwrites or gets bogged down in psychobabble, her novel becomes mundane. <br /> <br />Early in the novel, the child Anthony rejoices at the stories told by his family.  His mother and aunt compete to retell, embellish and recreate \\"one thread of a story and spin it along.\\"  With \\"passion,\\" family members listen, then \\"leap into a story and spin it along.\\"  \\"Sacred Time\\" succeeds because it advances Anthony's odyssey through the thread of a story, a thread which finds itself in the lives of the entire Amedeo family.  That thread of hidden fear, unspoken grief and unforgiven remorse, when stitched properly, makes this a novel worth reading and remembering.	2004-09-05

Such is the case with Simone Zelitch's \\"Louisa,\\" an allegorical novel exploring the relationship between a Holocaust survivor and her non-Jewish daughter-in-law.  Based on the Biblical story of Ruth (a point which the author ham-handedly repeats throughout her labored narrative), Zelitch's work is convoluted, confusing and confounding.<br /><br />\\"Louisa\\" strangles itself in a knotted, nearly incomprehensible narrative.  Nora Gratz, an irascible chain-smoking survivor, is yoked to her Teutonic-goddess daughter-in-law, Louisa.  Presumably owing her life to Louisa's determination to care for her during the Nazi occupation of Hungary, Nora never resolves her relationship with Louisa.  The interplay between the two women spans both pre and post-Holocaust Europe and Israel and achieves only an artificial and predictable resolution.  In between Nora's son falling in love with Louisa and the latter's ultimate dedication to Judaism (faithfully following the biblical template), readers must navigate at least four distinct narrative paths, none of which is easy to follow.  Zelitch does not permit or encourage identification or empathy with her major characters, instead preferring them to represent archetypes.  This may satisfy her need for allegory but does little to create authenticity in character.<br /><br />Equally unsettling is the confusion generated by the author's unnecessary and bothersome switching from one setting to another, one time period to another, one set of characters to another.  Zelitch seems not to be able to decide what kind of novel \\"Louisa\\" is to be.  It is, without success in any one area, a novel describing the disintegration of Jewish life in pre-Holocaust Hungary, a novel exploring the trying circumstances of falling in love during periods of social upheaval, a novel about the creation and fortification of Israel, or a novel about people with serious emotional and mental instabilities.<br /><br />The novel is confounding in many respects.  Characters disappear and reappear, sometimes hundreds of pages later.  The most compelling character in this novel about Jews is Louisa, whose determination to become Jewish takes on a heroic Christian tone in her seemingly eager welcoming of unwarranted suffering and rejection.  The most honorable character, a woman who becomes involved with Nora's mysterious cousin, deserves far more treatment than the scant twenty pages Zelitch provides her.  Nora's edgy anger, her unsettling personality and her tenuous grip on reality wear thin; by the time \\"Louisa\\" ends, readers have discovered their patience exhausted.  What could have been a profound examination of loss, identity and change instead is banal, unprovocative and disenchanting.<br /><br />Favorably compared to \\"Sophie's Choice\\" by the New York Times, \\"Louisa\\" is a disappointment.  Predictable, without focus and flat, the novel adds little to our understanding of righteous Gentiles, the psychological consequences of being a survivor or the creation of Israel.  For those interested in the story of Ruth, the original source would provide more emotional resonance than the novel.	2004-08-28

She lives in a comfortable suburban San Jose, California, home in the early 1970s with her staid, predictable father, her precociously bright younger sister and her mother, Shirley.  It is Shirley's descent into suicidal mental illness that sets Abby's internal compass spinning out of control in Jackie Moyer Fischer's redemptive debut novel, \\"An Egg on Three Sticks.\\"<br />Abby is absolutely believable; she is at once self-absorbed and powerfully affected by her mother's erratic, self-destructive behaviors.  Abby comes-of-age during a time of extreme family disintegration, and lacking the anchor of a stable mother, her otherwise understandable thirteen-year-old behaviors take on a distorted, desperate cast.  In truth, Abby becomes unmoored by her mother's attempted suicide, and her responses, which range from anger to guilt to indifference, reflect themselves in the author's commitment to write from Abby's voice.<br />This voice reflects a growing sexual awakening, a consciousness of self and a constantly reforming opinion of the very meaning of motherhood.  This skewed sensibility influences every decision Abby makes, every action she selects voice her hurt, confusion and outrage.  She knows her home is different from all the others in her neighborhood, not only in its exterior, but its internal workings as well.  To Abby, her home is \\"stuffed with cotton, stuffed with daughters who aren't daughters anymore, sisters who aren't sisters.\\"  Even worse is her understanding that her father is experiencing an even greater loss.  This gentle high-school typing teacher whose idea of a good time is spending time burning trash in his backyard incinerator transforms himself into a sad, preoccupied and furrow-faced man.  He is a \\"dad who isn't a dad, a husband who isn't a husband.\\"<br />By all external evidence, Shirley has fallen apart.  She goes swimming naked at midnight in a neighbor's pool; she disintegrates at the misplacement of a special dress.  In apique, she hurls Abby's galoshes into the fireplace and throws a Christmas-present crock pot against the wall.  Against this backdrop, Abby seeks solace from her oh-so-cool friend Poppy, whose divorced mother's lifestyle seems alluring and rebellious to the bereft Abby.  Abby engages in here own private acts of rebellion as well.  She disobeys the numerous restrictive rules placed on her by her parents; she shoplifts, and she involves herself with a Mexican boyfriend.  None of these acts restores Shirley, but all of them help Abby discover her inner self.<br />Unfortunately, \\"An Egg on Three Sticks\\" is not without its flaws.  The novel must have set a new record for number of one-sentence paragraphs.  And fragments too.  Abby's voice veers dangerously toward terminal insipidness.  Why, for instance, does Fischer insist on using invented terms like \\"dorkamundo?\\"<br />Which everyone knows is not how 70s teens would ever talk anyway.<br />Which is kinda beside the point, anyway.<br />These irritants, however, do not interfere with Abby's journey.  Jackie Moyer has written a book of rare integrity and authentic compassion.  \\"An Egg on Three Sticks\\" not only instructs us on the pain of mental illness, it educates us as to how a broken heart can mend itself.	2004-07-03

It evolved from childhood, and Samuel Hynes' gentle, understated and illuminating memoir, \\"The Growing Seasons,\\" assists in our understanding of how the generation that fought and won World War II came to be.  Fiercely independent, perpetually inquisitive and unabashedly self-conscious, Samuel Hynes comes of age in America's heartland during the Great Depression.  His story, crafted with gentle humor and exquisite detail, gains transcendence and slowly emerges as a representation of millions of youngsters grappling with the age-old obligation of developing an identity, but doing so in an era of frayed innocence and material dispossession.<br />Loss and impermanence permeate Hynes' childhood.  His father stoically accepts the death of his wife, unemployment as a result of a contracting economy and his own inability to serve the nation he so deeply loves.  This unspoken patriotism and sense of place nurture the young Hynes, who never overcomes the gaping wound of losing his mother to a premature death.  Motherloss uproots the Hynes' family; the father swallows prejudice and remarries a Catholic and Samuel begins the process of healing and carrying on with life.<br />While his father settles into his second family, Hynes spends a summer on a farm.  The city boy discovers new cadences to life, a different pattern to work.  Most importantly, Samuel gains a sense of his own past.  \\"For one season I had been one, like my father...and all those other country people in our family.\\"  With solemn pride, Hynes announces, \\"I had been my ancestors.\\"  With this knowledge of self, Hynes is better able to comprehend the modernizing influences besetting his altered family in Minneapolis during the 1930s. <br />There, he observes his father's deep ambivalence over labor violence.  A Shell oil salesman, the father is a rock-ribbed Republican who extols the virtue of independence and responsibility.  Yet, the father \\"despised the upper-class ways\\" of the elite.  Samuel watches his father's despair increase.  \\"Whoever won this war, something he believed in would lose.  It was sad, losing like that, and I felt his sadness.\\"  <br />Tempering Samuel's growing awareness of the world is his evolving relationship with his step-mother.  Hynes respects, admires and even likes her  --  her purposeful energy, her zeal for order, her enthusiasm for life and work --  but never loves her.  Even his thirteen-year-old autobiography excludes mention of her, and when his father coerces Samuel to include her, Samuel does so with a \\"chilled heart.\\"  Frugal and despeate to keep her family afloat, his step-mother sells a forgotten but cherished model train set.  Awash in the economic misery of the Great Depression, where even wanting something unneeded is considered unworthy, the sale reminds the still-growing Samuel of the transitory nature of life, that \\"anything could be taken.\\"<br />Yet, \\"The Growing Seasons\\" is far from grim.  Warmth abounds in the memoir, ranging from an excused absence from school due to a housekeeper's inability to close her mouth to the supreme satisfaction to Hynes' deep satisfaction at being able to finally don long pants to school instead of the dreaded knickers.  The evolution to adulthood, the absoption of what it means to be a man, the quiet knowledge of the necessity of standing alone  --  these benchmarks of maturation  --  bespeak a person truly in touch with his own personality and his own potential.<br />As Hynes becomes a man, with his attendant alienation from public school and his fascination with sex, he carries with him the formative experiences of childhood.  Chafing at his relative youth, longing to experience the formative fires of war, Hynes' restlessness symbolizes an American energy, a robust transformative power that rings true in this instructive and engaging memoir.	2004-06-02

She hopes to &quot;tell the story of how it is that a young person can survive great and terrible heartbreak&quot; and restore a sense of hope about her future.  Not only does Maynard succeed in this goal, but she has also crafted a work that deals with adolescent identity, family reformation and person response to social disaster.  Using sympathetic characters who struggle with sudden death, the author brings needed insight as to how Americans might overcome the trauma of September 11.<br />Thirteen-year-old Wendy complains about her mother's inability to understand her; she bristles contemptuously over her mother's sense of outrage about the father who abandoned both.  Despite the fact that Wendy has an adoring, creative and energetic step-father and a step-brother who worships her, she wades through her days awash in angst.  September 11, 2002 changes all that.  Everything that was stable, permanent, accepted crumbles; that which was certain becomes ambiguous.  &quot;Nothing was as it seemed  --  that was what she understood now.&quot;<br />Submerged in grief, her step-father Josh consents to Wendy leaving her Brooklyn home to spend time with her biological father, Garrett, who has created a life in Davis, California.  During this time of exile, Wendy confronts not only her grief, but her need to form an identity which will last the rest of her life.  This task, daunting as it is with an intact family, is made all the more difficult in a strange, unfamiliar environment.<br />Wendy reinvents herself, on occasion through subversion (when she furtively drops out of school), through lies (when she meets a warm-hearted bookstore owner) and through compassion (when she befriends a single teen-aged mother).  Every person she meets carries the scars of ruin and abandonment.  Her father, Garrett, lives daily with his private disappointment that he has been a failure to his suffocatingly elitist mother.  Garrett's woman companion, Carolyn, relives her decision to give up her only child for adoption.  The teen-aged mother, Violet, seethes with resentment over her white-trash life and consequently endangers her newborn son with her rage.  The bookstore owner, Adam, deals with an adult autistic son and a wife who is about to end their marriage as a consequence of her own guilt.<br />What makes &quot;The Usual Rules&quot; unusual is its refusal to present bromides and cliches as responses to unprecedented grief and anguish.  The characters' suffering is genuine, as is their iron-willed drive to regain a sense of life.  How should grieving progress?  What resources can we seek to give us a sense of hope amidst the deepest despair.  When do we find the ability to understand, as we have never done before &quot;how precious everything&quot; is.<br />Written by a talented author whose knowledge of the bruised heart informs every page, &quot;The Usual Rules&quot; has compelling narrative drive, beautifully rendered characters and realistic dialogue.  Above all, the novel is suffused with a sense of the possibility of renewal and hope, even when all around its wonderful protagonist radiates death and loss.	2004-05-23
US	50747195	R1WR5RSXEE91NT	0385318839	7702736	The Only Girl in the Car: A Memoir	Books	5	7	9	N	Y	memoirist faces her degradation with stoic, courageous honor	It took Kathy Dobie twenty years of adult living before she could come to grips with what occurred to her one frigid evening, victimized not only by sexual assault, but by her own misguided, destructive life decisions.  In order to honor that defining moment, she determined to \\"bear witness by writing about it.\\"  Her wrenching, illuminating memoir, \\"The Only Girl in the Car\\" not only honors memory, but transforms it into a profound contemplation of personality and identity.  Written with both clear-headed objectivity and profound compassion, this work will stand both as a warning and as a testimony to hope.  Dobie's ability to understand the conflicted surges of her teen-aged sexuality permits a rare glimpse into adolescent rebellion, family stress and personal reconciliation.<br />The author comes of age in a cohesive 1970s suburban New Haven family, complete with a martyred Catholic sense of suffering, duty and selfless obligtion.  As adolescence approaches, Dobie's allegiance changes from mother to father.  The \\"opposing narratives\\" of her parents' lives provide alternate paths.  Her mother, raised as a single child of a divorced mother, speaks of the past with a \\"keening complaint\\" and focuses on the \\"interior\\" pains of \\"hurt feelings and unhapiness.\\"  Her intensely focused father depicts \\"life as filled with tests, danger...and adventure.\\"  Initially, Dobie's \\"dreaminess and forgetfulness\\" clash with her father's \\"Germanic...distaste for both disorder and vulnerability,\\" but the author ultimately embraces her father's appetite for the \\"world's richness\\" and a \\"large life filled with drama.\\"<br />Paradoxically, Dobie is fascinated by passivity and gradually learns to link it with sexuality.  Both \\"unpredictable and sensual,\\" passivity charges her with sexual energy, so intense that she \\"swooned with pleasure.\\"  After her older brother runs away from home, Dobie discovers a \\"bewildering colness\\" overtaking her sensibilities, and she realizes that her days as a \\"witness, a handmaiden with the coffeepot\\" were about to end.  If her brother defined himself by physical removal, Dobie determines that sexuality will be her means of self-liberation.<br />At fourteen, the author's savors her realization that not only does her body have an impact on men, but their notice of her body inexplicably thrills her.  Gradually, Dobie engages in mindless, unfulfilling intercourse  --  an accepted rite of passage for young men but a terminally stigmatizing experience for young women.  Her sexual experiences result in numbness, not freedom; confusion, not certainty.  Her acts of rebellion estrange her from her family, friends and self.  Her sexual partners  --  boyfriends is far too intimate a designation  --  satisfy their needs on and through her, but never \\"with\\" her.  These young men have regular girlfriends with whom they would never act on their sexual impulses.  In the Madonna-whore dichotomy, there is no question which role Dobie assumes.  One young man even whispers \\"chinga\\" [Spanish for whore] into her ear during the sexual act.  In a surreal transposition of secret keeping, the people who are close to her are frozen out of Katie's new sexual identity and the nameless blue-collar young men and women of her town excoriate her, brutally branding her as promiscuous trash.<br />Dazed and slowly comprehending that her \\"life will never be the same,\\" Dobie watches the evaporation of her former identity, a sense that a younger self \\"was mine no longer.\\"  After the evening of her ultimate degradation, she asks rhetorially, \\"What kind of girl would let four boys do what those boys had done to me?\\"  Yet, she refuses to accept her victimization (painfully and powerfully recreated in the memoir), determined grimly to \\"face the music.\\" <br />Her reckoning and redemption begins in the act of truly befriending her sister Cindy, who is forced to wear a back brace to correct a spinal defect.  Caring for Cindy teaches Dobie that not only does life go on, but that the world could become beautiful through acts of kindness, consideration and love.  To the author's delight, life's unspoken beauty \\"would always be there, waiting.\\"<br />As Kathy Dobie seeks to authenticate her experiences, to comprehend their significance, she must confront the perpetrators.  Their indiffernce and menace convince her of the singularity of that night in the car and of her need to be \\"even more protective\\" of her memory, \\"more distrustful of other people's interpretations\\" of the assault.  These memories, \\"guarded for years\\" must be stored away, only to be opened for self-evaluation years later.  \\"The Only Girl in the Car\\" is the product of decades of sequestered memory and deliberate interpretation.<br />Memoirist Fern Schumer Chapman has written that identity is formed by self, family, place and past. Katie Dobie has used that formula and selected one defining moment to be the prism through which those four variables intersect.  Her identity, formed around frequent uncomprehending sexual intercourse as an early adolescent, rotates around the painful understanding that angry, sexually-frustrated young men radiate hatred towards young women who explore sex.  Ruefully, she concludes that these boys, soon to become men, will receive as much \\"pleasure to hurt a girl...as...to make love to her.\\"  Their cost is greater than hers.  She will overcome; they will not.	2004-05-17
US	50747195	R1T5BDURYWFYEO	0312302878	368940071	Leaving: A Novel	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	somber contemplation of African-American life merits praise	Some fifty years from now, Richard Dry's brilliant debut novel \\"Leaving\\" will be given the same homage Ralph Ellison's \\"Invisible Man\\" now receives.  \\"Leaving\\" is a somber, chilling and compelling contemplation on the nature of African-American life since World War II.  The novel blends gut-wrenching dislocation, ironic perception and terrifying alienation in its provocative commentary on racism's lingering impact.  Dry, through brilliant characterization and taut narrative drive, extends his vision to the entire scope of the African-American post-war experience, from disintegration and despair to reclamation and redemption.  The result is a spellbinding saga of three generations of Blacks, each of which is scarred by the impact of racial oppression, each of which develops its own capacity to comprehend and confront life's hurtful circumstances.<br />Deftly interweaving three cross-cutting narratives, \\"Leaving\\" traces the evolution of Ruby Washington's family, from its rural South Carolina roots to the coarse, drug and violence-saturated streets of Oakland California.  It is a novel which treats not only the arc of personal odysseys, but how the individual lives of the Washington family fit in the historical stream of African-American history.  Indeed, an anonymous prisoner, whose words reverberate consistently throughout the novel, underscores this historical consciousness when he insists that African-Americans \\"dive into your history.\\"  He warns that \\"without the knowledge of your past, you're likely to\\" repeat the same mistakes past generations made in trying to understand racism.  Without knowledge, without a sense of self, the nameless prisoner scolds, African-Americans will \\"pace back and forth\\" on the raft of history, \\"like a beast in this jail-cage.\\"<br />\\"Leaving,\\" however, is much more that a book that elevates consciousness.  It is a novel that elicits our most profound emotional alliances with its characters, even when the men, women and children portrayed repel and repulse us with their shortcomings.  Even in its depiction of depravity, the novel gains transcendence.  Despite its overwhelming portrait of urban material and spiritual poverty, \\"Leaving\\" encourages hope.  The repository of that hope, curiously enough, is the oldest member of the Washington family, Ruby Washington, who suffers the memory of witnessing the murder of her beloved intended Ronald after the latter has challenged the reigning white supremists in his small South Carolina community.  Ruby is a living martyr, sacrificing her life to the care of her conflicted half-brother Love Easton, her drug-riddled daughter Lida and her two tormented, blighted grandchildren, Ronald Love and Paul \\"Li'l Pit\\" LeRoy.<br />Dry offers no pat answers to racism.  His characters carry horrific scars but often choose paths that can only carry them to greater degradation and self-effacement.  \\"Leaving\\" provides little solace to those who believe that we are winning the battle against drugs in African-American communities.  Given the prevalence of anti-social influences in Oakland's African-American community as depicted by Dry, readers may well conclude that our nation has fractured into disparate racial nations.  Yet, despite the preponderance of accusatory evidence, \\"Leaving\\" never wavers in its belief that human struggle results in victories:  hard-earned, seemingly insignificant and even incidental.  But victories nonetheless.<br />(...)	2004-05-04

Esmeralda Santiago's &quot;When I Was Puerto Rican&quot; is a stunning success; it not only captures the dynamics of identity creation, does so in the context of ethnic, class and geographic tensions.  Santiago's coming-of-age saga encompasses an incipient awareness of her unique status as an oldest daughter, conflicted thinker and anguished observer of family disintegration.  That she writes without a drop of self-pity is remarkable given the abundance of sadness and betrayal which swirl in her story.<br />For much of her childhood in Puerto Rico and her early adolescence in New York City, Santiago lives a dual life.  Possessed of a &quot;stubborn pride,&quot; her &quot;frightened self hid&quot; behind a false veneer of acceptance that &quot;everything was all right.&quot;  At once proud and ashamed of her rural &quot;jibaro&quot; identity, Santiago grapples with exactly who and what she is.  In this respect, &quot;When I Was Puerto Rican&quot; reverberates with the near-universal dynamic of identity creation, hidden shame at life's circumstances and constant questioning of how and why families created such tortured environments in which children evolve.<br />Plaguing Santiago is the ambiguous, tormented relationship between her mother and father.  Exposed equally to the sounds of lovemaking and arguments, Santiago can neither be surprised that her parents never wed or the constant absence of her hard-working, poetic but irresponsible father.  Eventually, the pressures of this quasi-marital status between Mami and Papi erupt, and Santiago saves her best writing for its description.  As her mother and father savage each other in verbal warfare, &quot;they growled words that made no sense.&quot;  Their  fighting echoes &quot;all the hurts and insults, the dinners gone to waste, the women, the abandonments.&quot;  As Santiago &quot;crouched against the wall,&quot; she witnesses her parents &quot;disfigure&quot; themselves with anger.  &quot;In their passion Mami and Papi had  forgotten&quot; their children.  They were real &quot;only to one another.&quot;  Santiago and her siblings cower in a corner, &quot;afraid that if we left them, they might eat each other.&quot;<br />This authentic voice carries throughout the memoir as the author explores the various influences of her own existence.  Nicknamed &quot;Negi&quot; by her parents due to her dark complexion, Santiago is acutely aware of her ethnicity and is perplexed upon her move to New York that people who look like her (African-Americans) have deep, unfounded suspicions about her and her people.  As a Puerto Rican, she develops ambivalence about the United States and the American presence not only on her native island, but in her heart as well.  How American will she become?  At what cost?  These are the same questions millions of immigrants have asked themselves as they immerse themselves in their new land.  But how can she be &quot;new&quot; when Puerto Rico is and has been America for all of her life.<br />Though &quot;When I Was Puerto Rican&quot; treats Esmeralda Santiago's life during the 1950s and 1960s, it has a timeless feel to it.  Moving, illuminating and compelling, this memoir does much more than describe one girl's emerging self; it invites us to explore our own past and examine the forces which have created our own identity.ed against the wall,&quot; she witnesses her parents &quot;disfigure&quot; themselves with anger.  &quot;In their passion Mami and Papi had  forgotten&quot; their children.

Featuring intriguing characters, exploring complicated themes and embracing nearly forty years of women confronting the arcs of their lives, the novel could have blended feminist sensibilities, intellectual curiosity and social consciousness.  Instead, seemingly aware that the novel would be an instantaneous hit, Landvik created a predictable pot-boiler that not only betrays her talent as a writer but sadly trivializes the very themes and ideas that are important to her.<br />Five Minneapolis women find themselves bound to each other by their shared passion for books.  Faith, Audrey, Merit, Slip and Kari become real to each other not only through the literature they choose to share but by the texture of their lives.  The novel follows the five women from the 1960s to the turn of the twenty-first century.  While permitting them the necessary time and space to evolve, Landvik conveniently compels them to face every conceivable social change and personal dilemma a woman could face.  By the time the five have confronted hidden childhood trauma, adultery, homosexuality, adoption and spousal abuse, the reader feels as bloated as the women must have been after eating the calorie-laden desserts which seem to receive even more attention from the author than the books selected by each participant.  <br />To Landvik's credit, she permits her characters to grapple with both personal and social issues.  There is mess, anguish and elation as the five confront the core circumstances of their lives.  Yet, the reader knows, just as soon as a tough dilemma shows itself, that there will be a kind resolution.  In this sense, &quot;Angry Housewives&quot; is a false novel.  Every heartbreak is followed by a rainbow-like resolution; there is never any doubt that &quot;happy ever after&quot; is the absolute  focus of the novel.  <br />Even its most provocative character, Faith, whose tormented childhood has compelled her to invent a fictive past, never invites readers to consider what could have happened had she lived her entire life submerged by guilt.  Instead, her catharsis lacks only violins in the background when she confronts blighted hopes and limited horizons.  Landvik's writing languishes as well.  Her use of metaphors comes from the golly-gee-whiz school and would be red-lined by any conscientious middle school composition teacher.<br />&quot;Angry Housewives Eating Bon-Bons&quot; is a harmless enough concoction.  It permits readers to think they are living through feminist angst and genuine personality development.  It tantalizes us by making readers believe that they are genuinely involved in the lives of five fascinating women.  It presents a pasteurized version of significant social upheaval of the past half century.  But it does so in a manner so pat, so comfortable that the reader never worry about  true anger, true power.  <br />Gone are the complicated characters which populate &quot;Patty Jane's House of Curl.&quot;  Instead, Lorna Landvik has capitalized on her deserved popularity with a homogenized version of life, sure to catapult the novel to popularity, but at the cost of authenticity.	2004-04-18

They cause us to examine the nature of our selves, to catalogue our strengths and reflect on what could have been.  Suzanne Matson's compassionate and true debut novel, &quot;The Hunger Moon,&quot; explores the impact of isolation and family loss through the intertwined lives of three female protagonists.  Despite their differences in class, age and experience, the three women discover meaning, vision and strength through their growing interdependence.  This connectedness gives &quot;The Hunger Moon&quot; both its poignancy and urgency.<br />Renata is the most complicated of the three characters.  A seemingly nondescript single mother of an endearing infant son, Renata has chosen to hit the road, leaving her child's father ignorant of his fatherhood.  Renata discovers that her freeom is illusory; instead of liberating her, her eventual choice of Boston as her home finds her rootless, unmoored not only from her west-coast heritage, but without the comforting safety net of caring friends.  While struggling with the practical aspects of economic survival and motherhood, Renata must also come to grips with the impact of her decision to remove her son Charlie from his unknown father, Bryan. In turn, she must question herself as to her convoluted, ill-defined feelings about love, commitment and marriage. <br />As she grapples with the moral dilemma her life choices has engendered, Renata slowly develops a relationship with the newly reclusive Eleanor, a successful jurist whose recent widow status has resulted in her literally stripping away the veneer of her past family life.  Now living in a starkly barren apartment, Eleanor finds a delighted surprise in bonding with her freshly-discovered neighbor Renata.<br />Joining this mix is the conflicted June.  Bulimic and ravaged by constant academic and artistic disappointments (she is a flop as a student and troubled by her lack of success as a dancer), June receives no solace from her parents  --  a distant, indifferent father and a mother reeling from the pressures of compelled personal reinvention.  June satisfies her hunger for connection through caretaking and babysitting, two services which reintroduce her to her own humanity.<br />It is the elemental reawakening  --  to possibility, to hope, to humanity  --  which invests &quot;The Hunger Moon&quot; with such dignity.  Matson's sensitive exploration of the nature of family ties, the difficult choices women face in offering themselves to others in love and the impact of personal responsibility in times of emotional duress gives her writing an urgeny and an elegance rare in debut novels.  The author interweaves her characters' lives with the same skill as she develops their distinct personalities.<br />&quot;The Hunger Moon&quot; satisfies as story and as fable.  Eleanor, June and Renata develop qualities which sustain and broaden; their personal stories become illustrative of what we can become once we shed the restrictive walls which shut us off not only from others, but from our true inner selves.	2004-03-30

Comfortable characters yearn for contentment; conflicts have tidy, predictable resolution, and Dixie living comes off as far superior to its sterile, contentious competitor, the dreaded Yankee way-of-life.  Hudler seems to delight in having at least three food references on every page, as if to proudly show the reader, &quot;See, I'm a man who is unafraid of the kitchen.&quot;  &quot;Southern Living&quot; is harmless enough and is a pleasant, unchallenging read, but it disappoints because its central themes yearn for better treatment.  Hudler needs to learn that gentle comedy and social satire need to fulfill the reader's appetite more than another serving of smothered chicken.<br />At first glance, &quot;Living&quot; holds promise.  Set in contemporary Selby, Georgia, the novel examines the impact of late twentieth-century social change on a community seemingly frozen somewhere in the post-Civil War era.  Equally intriguing is the confluence of the novel's three central characters, each a woman with a compelling story and internal conflicts.  The author effectively uses dialogue to advance the narrative, and his cross-cutting chapters gracefully bridge time.<br />Yet, the novel sadly betrays its promise and its premises.  Instead of complexity and texture, &quot;Living&quot; relies on stereotype and philosophic bromides.  Selby seemingly has every new-fangled social circumstance hit it all at once; from Japanese executives at the recently-opened Toyota plant to a Yankee editor of the local newspaper, Selbyites are yanked unwillingly into a multicultural world.  Rather than examine the implications of this new world on the community, the author unwittingly places people of color where they always have been, in the background or on the periphery.<br />Each protagonist begs to have her story told with more compassion than the author could muster.  The most cliched of the three is Suzanne Parley, who has transcended her white-trash childhood and married the town patriarch.  Restless, bored and frightened by the clear sterility of her life, Suzanne spends money recklessly ($1500 on a see-through raincoat!) and invents a pregnancy to add spice to her life.  It doesn't take a genius to see that she will receive a comeuppance.  <br />Yankee transplant Margaret Pinaldi, the daughter of a firebrand abortion rights activist, inherits a Selby home upon the death of her mother.  Quiet, almost diffident, Margaret undergoes a personality transformation once she discovers life south of the Mason-Dixon line.  She casts off her prejudicial attitudes towards Southerners, is caught in a romantic triangle and somehow manages to intersect her job as a journalist with both Suzanne and the novel's most compelling character, Donna Kabel.<br />Facially scarred by an automobile accident, Donna must recreate her life.  After losing her job as a cosmetics saleswoman/advisor, she finds employment in the produce section of a local Kroger's supermarket.  Rejecting the iron-fisted religiosity of her father, Donna discovers purpose in fruits and vegetables, and, in so doing, sets out to change the dietary habits of her community.  Unfortunately, she receives the least amount of space in the novel, and her challenges --  spiritually, physically, emotionally  --  are undernourished and scantily discussed.  Hudler conveys great sensitivity in places for Donna; in a moving epiphany, she &quot;learned that the most delicious and beautiful of God's creations often hid behind an imperfect epidermis.&quot;<br />Perhaps the greatest strength of &quot;Southern Living&quot; is also its greatest weakness.  Ad Hudler doesn't want us to think too much while reading his gentle, kind novel.  He would prefer us to salivate at the non-stop references to food and laugh at the foibles of the pretentious Suzanne.  He wants us to root for Margaret and feel sympathy for the beleaguered Donna.  But he doesn't want us to lose any sleep over any of his characters.  He needn't worry.  &quot;Southern Living&quot; satisfies the appetite but not the soul.	2004-03-15

Talented and unsparing, Dani Shapiro brings her early adulthood into focus through her wrenching &quot;Slow Motion,&quot; a memoir which captures the depth of self-eradication, the anguish of lost hopes and the wish for restored possibilities.  That the author attains insight as a result of her parents' invovlement in a horrific car accident lends a poignancy to her emotional evolution.  Shapiro understands the difference between a lamentation and self-pity, and she respects her readers enough to trust both their censure and their hopes for her restoration.<br />Dani Shapiro seemingly has it all.  The product of a talented, tormented, observant father and a bright, driven secular mother, the author's Jewish identity dissolves but never disappears as she enters young adulthood.  Flushed with early childhood fame as a sought-after model, blessed with talent as a writer and thinker, Shapiro spirals downwards in college.  She dates and then becomes a lover to a classmate's father.  She lies to herself and others as her relationship with him drains her emotional resources and self-respect.  Ultimately, Shapiro finds herself descending into a vortex of physical indulgence and spiritual bankruptcy.  She adds to this mixture a growing addiction to alcohol.  Soon, Dani Shapiro has the screwed-up life of an alcoholic.<br />This thinly-constructed fabic of a life cannot withstand the pressures of having to care for two invalid parents, one physically ruined, the other permanently harmed mentally.  Her parents' apparent and submerged wounds reflect Shapiro's own mangled life, and the author must summon dignity, resolve and courage to confront not only her own dissipation but her parents' mortality.  This forced confrontation, with her own demons and her parents' disabilities, gives the memoir its singular strength.<br />&quot;Slow Motion&quot; is not without flaws.  Shapiro never explains why her classmate would set Shapiro up with her father, despite the author's guilty previous remonstrations against further involvement.  Nor does Shapiro adequately explain why she selects a path of self-destruction; elegant and moving biographical sketches of her mother and father do not replace the author's avoidance of answering the most perplexing question of all:  why would a person of such enormous beauty and talent make such dismal choices about her life.<br />Nevertheless, &quot;Slow Motion&quot; is a memoir of remarkable integrity.  As Dani Shapiro regains control of her life, reclaims connection with her parents and restores her own sense of dignity, she is uncompromsing in her self-criticism.  It is a rare author who so gracefully opens her life to public scrutiny without begging for absolution.  This memoir will bring hope to anyone yearning for repair.	2004-03-11

Under the pretense of examining the devastating impact of unexpected death on sensitive adolescents, Moynihan manages to include every conceivable plot contrivance, cardboard characterization and tear-saturated sigh she can muster.  The result is a dreary, unbelievable story that achieves the worst possible result:  readers who lack sympathy for her protagonist and who could care less about the anguish the protagonist presumably feels.<br />Alice McGuire attends a quasi-private progressive high school in suburban New Jersey.  Her classmates, when not busy on cold fusion physics projects, chumming around with budding rap stars, sojourning in Europe or writing operas, aren't so much late teens but weary, jaded adults pretending to be younger.  Wise, but stupid beyond her years, Alice mourns the loss of her one-true-love, Matthew Swan, a seemingly perfect young man who just happens to die in Mexico while accompanying a bereft female \\"friend\\" who needed his comfort while scoring drugs.  Why Matthew would travel thousands of miles with a girl whom he barely knows while leaving his heartthrob Alice behind defies logic, but, as much else in \\"Stone Garden,\\" believability has long before checked out.<br />There is not one character who is credible.  Not Alice's father, whose goofy laid-back acquiescence is atonement for his adulterous affair with Matthew's drug-addicted mother.  Not the earnest and oh-so-wonderful lesbian teacher, Ms. Hardwood, who, in addition to falling in love with the village blacksmith (yes, there is still a village blacksmith...), carries her own long-lost heterosexual lover in her memory.  Not in the long-suffering Sigrid, who witnessed the murder of her babysitter by a criminal who coincidentally is inovlved in a prison writing project assisted by, naturally, Alice.<br />Molly Moynahan should know better.  As a teacher, she knows that teens are more complex than the young men and women she presents.  As a capable writer, she knows that readers deserve genuine conflict and realistic dialogue.  Regardless of age, unexpected death engenders complicated, volatile and unpredictable responses from the living.  \\"Stone Garden\\" betrays the possibilities of this terrible circumstance, instead preferring overripe, implausible commentary.  In this sense, Moynahan's novel is false and fraudulent.	2004-03-11

The author's fertile imagination invests her three sensitive youthful protagonists with grim humor, bewildered knowledge and understated fear as a consequence of the terrifying wave of child murders which traumatized the African-American community of Atlanta in 1982.  By focusing on the emotional terrain of three marginalized fifth-graders, Jones permits \\"Leaving\\" to soar far beyond its setting.  Indeed, Jones compels us to consider life's transitory trajectory, the acute pain of impermanence and the lasting residue of loss, all through the eyes and hearts of three kids already overburdened by crumbling families and outcast status at school.  <br />Blending perfectly etched descriptive passages with utterly believable dialogue, Jones insists we observe fear's grip through child pariahs' eyes.  Grim realizations that classmates and neighbors are disappearing (and presumably \\"gone\\" forever) compete with everyday slights that cause us to wince at the corrosive power sadness casts over the lives of the three protagonists.  Tasha, Rodney and Octavia are shunned, disparaged and ridiculed; they cope by withdrawing, failing academically or combatting their adversaries, all depending on their daily internal barometer or the time and place.  Each child, despite every manifest act directed against them by the popular in-crowd, yearns desperately for acceptance.<br />\\"Leaving\\" illuminates the thin but resilient membrane that African-American fifth-graders develop to protect themselves from societal racism and internal self-doubt. Despite all the pressures operating to impede their development, these children permit their yet fragile selves to grow.  Tasha's quiet, unwelcomed fall into second-class social standing hurls her reluctantly into a recognition and identification with Rodney's unique status as class loser.  Tiny Rodney  --  the butt of everyone's jokes  --  suffers badly at home as well.  His distant, dismissive father humiliates him everywhere, including in front of his classmates while dishing out a vicious whipping to his numbed son.  Rodney's sole solace is Octavia, whose dark black skin color earns her the epithet \\"Watusi\\" from her classmates.  Born out of wedlock to a proud but struggling mother, Octavia bounces between being her mom's \\"Sweet Pea\\" to her classmates' bull's-eye for insults.  Of the three characters, Octavia is truly fully realized.<br />\\"Leaving\\" contains much more than a sketch of the impact of serial murders on a frightened community.  Jones introduces three distinct father figures, and even the father who is physically absent casts a significant emotional impact.  The three mothers defy easy characterization; the fierce love of Octavia's mother contrasts sharply with the distanced, addled imbalance of Rodney's.  The author also has her finger squarely on the pulse of schoolyard life; her classroom scenes are wrenchingly accurate.<br />Above all, \\"Leaving Atlanta\\" treats loss, the understanding \\"that people get away from you like a handful of sweet smoke.\\"  Tayari Jones knows that damage to the spirit and heart is much more difficult to treat compared to \\"tending to the wounds that I can see.\\"  Murder's terror augments the painful epiphany of life's brevity, even to children who ought reach that clarity much, much later in life.  Full of integrity and authentic emotion, this novel is a triumph.	2004-02-18

After having discovered love and a desire to establish a life with her intended, she cannot abide removing herself from her past experiences as a stripper.  This strangely narcissistic, provocative and demeaning profession has grafted itself on her identity.  Burana needs, one last time, to relive her past life, to understand what motivated her to become a stripper and to place exotic dance into perspective.  This one \\"last hurrah\\" becomes grist for her enticing, complex and satisfying memoir, \\"Strip City.\\"  Full of detail (in some cases, too much detail) and strengthened by the author's willingness to cut herself no slack in her quest for authentic understanding, \\"Strip City\\" explores and exposes a way of life which arouses admiration, condemnation and ambivalence.<br />Ultimately, Burana offers no pat answers as to her core motivations in the selection of stripping as a profession.  Driven by alienation as a teenager and subsequent economic necessity, she reluctantly invents herself as a performer and risks her identity on satisfying others' fantasties.  Her candid admission that she really doesn't know why she persisted in a stripper's life (given her obvious talent as a writer) is frustrating to the reader, especially after traveling with her through a year-long national farewell tour of strip joints.  However, to her credit, Burana's odyssey is neither self-congratulatory or exculpatory.  Her courage to face her own life and her steadfast commitment to discover her true internal compass bestow a sense of grace and honesty to her writing.<br />Part autobiography, part social history, part contemplative rumination, \\"Strip City\\" explores a \\"business of many hungers.\\"  Burana acknowledges that stripping can be inhumane and dehumanizing, to both participants and observers, but at the same time exhilarating and liberating.  Containing the \\"volatile elements of sex, money and power,\\" stripping confirms and belies stereotypes.  Just as one feels comfortable with conclusions about the women who bare themselves for money and the customers who get off (or get bored) by women performers, Burana presents a personal anecdote, a historical reference or a colleague whose life blasts conventional wisdom to bits.<br />At its best, \\"Strip City\\" breathes fresh air into our national debate about sexuality, sexual expression and women's bodies.  At its worst, the memoir is repetitive and borders on obsessive in its details about exotic dance.  Yet, it is an important work.  Full of behind-the-scene observations and candid self-criticism, \\"Strip City\\" not only describes a robust life, it illuminates the darker corners of unfulfilled needs and unanswered existential questions.	2004-02-12

A psychotherapist, Grossman committed the cardinal sin of having sexual contact with one of his patients, and that pivotal moment ruined his marriage and removed his one-year-old son from his life.  Now, some thirty years later, Grossman seeks reconnection, not only with his absent son, Daniel, but with his own soul.<br />Shapiro tightly interweaves present and past in \\"Wreck,\\" and her unsentimental, spare style encourages identification with Solomon while eliciting sympathy with Daniel.  Never at peace with himself about his past actions and constantly numbed by the withering impact of Holocaust loss, Solomon has reconstructed his professional life after his loss of job and respect but has never overcome the emptiness engenedered by self-reproach.  The strength of the novel is its involvement with the internal life of Solomon; its weakness is a contrived and mawkish conclusion.<br />Any parent who has suffered either spiritual or physical separation from a beloved child will respond to Solomon's perpetual sadness.  Nothing can abate his ever-present sense of failure and loss.  Sequestered in a tightly-controlled environment (he even alphabatizes the books in his psychology library), his days given to \\"curing\\" others, Solomon receives little satisfaction and even less solace from his profession.  In fact, therapy mocks his own failure and flaws.  This intelligent, broken man even lacks the energy and courage to seek out his son, instead discovering him on a television news broadcast.<br />Shapiro handles the eventual reunion and subsequnet rediscovery of father and son with care.  Ironically, it is the son who bestows upon the father the blessing of love and connection.  Despite years of anticipation and emotional preparation, Solomon is unprepared for the impact of reconnection.  Daniel is dealing with his own wreckage...a failed marriage and a life of existential wandering, and his realizations that he has a father, that his father is alive and that his father has loved him are deeply moving.  However, Shapiro seems not to know what to do next, and her decision as to the disposition of each character saps \\"Wreck\\" of its intial hard-edged strength.	2004-02-11

Her novel, &quot;Blessings,&quot; is ample proof that fully-realized characters bestow a sense of grace and dignity as they struggle with their given circumstances.  Quindlen tackles the themes of discovered opportunities, parenting, hidden shame and life's unexpected possibilities for renewal with her usual dignity and skill.  It is the depth of her characterizations which invest her novel with strength and dignity.  <br />Reclusive Lydia Blessing hires a handyman/caretaker on a whim.  She knows little of his past, but trusts her own instincts.  She lives alone, scarcely comforted by an irascible housekeeper and disquieted by a terrible sense of spiritual isolation.  Utterly unexpecting the sudden altering of her sequestered existence, Lydia will be forced to confront not only the possibilities of love but of the necessity of facing a carefully hidden past.   <br />Skip Cuddy is reeling from his own blighted choices; alone and disappointed with life's prospects, he discovers an abandoned newborn on the steps leading to his live-in garage apartment.  With nothing other than hope to guide him, he accepts and ultimately embraces surrogate fatherhood.  Naming and raising the baby girl he considers to be &quot;his&quot; Faith emerge as the galvanizing integrative forces on his personality.  Qualities he never knew he possessed emerge; this marginalized, unconfident, doubting man evolves into a quiet, responsible and responsive parent.<br />The beauty of &quot;Blessings&quot; is its refusal to follow a &quot;feel-good&quot; formula; the conclusion is unsettling and provocative.  Both of its protagonists struggle with themselves as they face the daunting task of assuming responsibility of Faith.  Lydia ruefully looks back on her life, assesses the genesis of her short-lived marriage and evaluates her own mothering skills.  Each recollectionhas its cost, and Lydia's veneer of comfortable routine and self-imposed exile dissolves under the redemptive weight of acceptance and love.  Skip painfully unearths the cost of false friendship and learns that giving oneself to a child results in self-transformation and redemption.  In this sense, Lydia and Skip's individual and mutual epiphanies are the novel's greatest blessings.<br />Anna Quindlen delights in asking questions to which her novel can only suggest answers.  Preferring to allow her readers to involve themselves in the moral dilemmas her characters face, the author invites us to embrace and identify with her protagonists.  As Lydia and Skip receive Faith  --  as their daughter and as their purpose in life  --   we come to understand our own obligations, to ourselves and to the people we choose to love and sustain.	2004-01-26

But to find it, readers must wade through page-long descriptive paragraphs, narrative detours so lengthy that one is left wondering what the central plot is and characters so predictably unidemensional they set one's teeth on edge.  What makes Tartt's second novel so bad is that she is a good writer, a talented observer of the human condition and an interesting commentator on existential dilemmas.  Her novel betrays her abilities.<br />Presumably, endearing Harriet Dufresnes intends to solve a decade-long hushed mystery as to why her older brother Robin was discovered hanging from a tree in her yard.  Instead, the author leads readers into a mystery as to why they continue to read.  Interesting characters wither or disappear; minor characters receive excessive examination.  Stereotypes abound, and not in subtle manners.  The African-American maids who hover in the households of Harriet's aunts' homes speak as if living in antebellum period instead of the 1970s; Tartt acts as if the civil rights movement never occurred in the South and that older African-Americans are comfortable with Stepin Fetchit roles.  Harriet's evil antagonists are poster boys for white trash in-breeding.  Their descent into drug-saturated paranoia wears thin quickly, and their mendacity assumes a surreal, cartoon-like quality.<br />Tartt does display talent when, during the rare occasions she permits Harriet to explore her own potential for danger and insight, the author allows the narrative to absorb the reader.  However, those moments are rare.  Instead, her novel predictably reverts into languid, esoteric, infatuated descriptive passages.  These overwritten sections may well cause the reader to wonder if the author was paid by the word.  And what words. Many times, Tartt prefers vocabulary designed to confuse rather than enlighten; in this sense, what ought be a humble, child-focused book becomes an exercise in pretentious, author-centered verbiage.<br />Other reviewers have lauded &quot;The Little Friend&quot; for its atmosphere and psychological insights.  The &quot;New York Times&quot; even selected it as a &quot;Notable Book;&quot; its reviewer predicted it would become &quot;a special kind of classic.&quot;  Donna Tartt may have indeed written a classic, but not in the way she had intended.  Readers seeking a young, honorable, conflicted female protagonist ought reread &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; and Donna Tartt should consider remembering that in many great works of fiction, &quot;less is more.&quot;	2004-01-21

Following the deserved acclaim of \\"Dreamland,\\" his \\"Paradise Alley\\" shepherds us into the vortex of the Civil War, dissecting a pivotal experience which serves as the litmus test not only of that war, but of the very nation split asunder.  \\"Paradise Alley,\\" through the variegated perspectives of Irish immigrants, an African-American former slave, a jaded newsman and a cynical Tammany Hall functionary, forces us to relive the infamous New York City draft riots of July, 1863.  This paroxysm of racist violence, now known as the largest cataclysm of urban violence in our national past, alternately terrifies, revolts and sensitizes the reader to the realities of the social impact of the Civil War.<br />The Irish-American rioters, fueled by class antagonisms ($300 could purchase an exemption from the draft for any northerner wealthy enough to buy a replacement), humiliated by their own maraginalized existence and energized by their own basest instincts, symbolize American life at its racist worst.  Baker leves little and everything to the imagination in his agonizingly detailed depiction of African-Americans driven naked from their own homes, hung from lampposts, burned alive after vicious mobs cut and mutilated their defenseless bodies.  This in New York, the epicenter of our national identity; this from the side of that war presumably fighting for the abolition of slavery and the restoration of a cohesive, perpetual union.  The individual acts of heroism, resistance and compassion stand in stark relief to the sunami of human indifference, racial polarization and sadistic violence.  Baker's skill as a novelist is on display as he deftly undertakes his explanation of how a degraded, despised and depressed population  --  the Irish  --  are able only to hate, rather than empathize with, another population group itself sipping from the chalice of hopelessness.<br />One of my closest college friends, in analyzing urban ethnic backlash against African-Americans a century later, in the late 1960s, commented that the only people the ethnics hated more than Blacks were themselves.  In \\"Paradise Alley,\\" a relatively minor character, Finn McCool, a Democratic wardheeler, exploits this knowledge and orchestrates the orgy of violence, shamelessly baiting his own desperate countrymen to abysmal behaviors.  Finn understands what drives men like Dangerous Johnny Dolan, whose survival of the decimation wrought by the Irish potato famine resulted in a man truly demonic, unhinged from the most basic moral conventions that permit us to call ourselves human.  Dolan's insatiable need for violence, his unquenchable thirst to harm, his unthrottled hunger for dominance stand in sharp contrast to the stoic resignation and familial solidity of Tom O'Kane and the eerily distanced and detached H.R. Robinson, whose journalistic self-absorbtion gets him column inches but costs him his only chance for true human connection.<br />As important as the male characters are to \\"Paradise Alley,\\" the novel's women are reasons to celebrate.  It is they, and the honorable African-American male protagonist, Billy Dove, who are the novel's moral anchors.  The women give \\"Paradise Alley\\" resonance, emotional texture and empathy.  The fiery prostitute Maddy Boyle enlarges her principles and outspoken integrity when others crawled on hands and knees in moral muck.  Deidre Dolan O'Kane upbraids herself for tendencies of self-righteousness and lack of compassion when she literally stands erect above the howling masses.  Shedding the restrictions and nostrums of traditional Catholic moral instruction, she invents, on the fly, a tough-minded compassion and unyielding commitment to honor, service and family when those qualities were virtually non-existent in her community.  Ruth Dove, doubly brutalized by famine and Johnny Dolan, is Christ-like.  The author leaves the interpretation of the significance of her suffering  --  on behalf of her husband, Billy Dove, and her bi-racial children  -- to the reader.  Redemptive or not, Ruth's pain becomes the quintessential symbol of the nation, and how she lives becomes a matter of moral importance to the reader.<br />Baker employs cross-cutting narratives and perspectives; each character perceives the present against a constantly evolving personal exposition.  These flashbacks not only permit Baker to invest his characters with dimension and history, they permit the author to explore a stunning array of subjects:  the potato famine, the development of New York City's physical development, volunteer fire companies, race relations, tenement life and evolving cultural standards.  The research that preceded the writing of \\"Paradise Alley\\" must have been enormous, and the payoff is impressive.<br />This believable, chastening and powerful novel demands attention and respect.  \\"Paradise Alley\\" adds luster to Kevin Baker's reputation as a wise, prophetic interpreter of who and what we are as a people.	2004-01-12
US	50747195	R22YTWWL56Q7BX	0375760679	775151613	Logan's Storm: A Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	feisty everyman serves as fitting capstone to Cajun trilogy	We have long enjoyed defining the American character through our literary heroes.  We prefer rough-hewn men, resolute in their own vision of the world, often at odds stuffy conformity, comfortable with their reprobate attitude.  Huck Finn exemplifies this allegiance to the rebellious, misunderstood, action-based hero.  It matters little if this figure has stretched or broken the law; his illegal behavior usually results from altercations with ignorant, small-minded or prejudiced authority figures.  Beneath an exterior of illiteracy or deceptively simple manners reside an elemental decency, a profound dignity and an abiding optimism about the human condition.  <br />The perceptive author Ken Wells understands our perpetual hunger for these larger-than-life heroes, and his final installment of the Catahoula Bayou trilogy, &quot;Logan's Storm,&quot; satisfies our appetite.  Logan LaBauve, already erroneously pronounced dead as a result of avenging his son's abuse at the hands of a racist cop, confronts nature, faces down bad guys and even finds room in his broken heart to open himself up to the possibilities of love.  Logan, through dialogue and action, reminds us of the best aspects of our quest to become genuinely self-made.  His unceasing and unflinching confrontation with life's exigencies, messes and hopes serves as a cock-eyed model for even polished urbanites.  This man lives large, loves life and doesn't hesitate to squeeze living for all that it's worth.<br />&quot;Logan's Storm&quot; is actually less a novel than it is three extended vignettes.  Each vignette serves as a means through which Logan's character is tested, fortified and sublimely altered.  What results is a bayou character who is a loyal friend, savvy con-artist, expert storyteller and redoubtable champion of little old ladies and stricken children in distress.  This swamp superman throws out Cajun metaphors with the same grace he demonstrates when he teases a meal out of bayou critters.  He knows exactly how much bilge he can safely swallow from adversaries and precisely when to strike back.  Though Ken Wells moves his story with breathtaking confidence, he never forgets why the reader will rapidly turn each page.<br />Unfortunately, the last two vignettes don't carry the power and promise of the first.  We first meet Logan during his sojourn in a dangerous swamp, on the lam from prejudiced officers who'd like nothing better than to lay their hands on not only Logan, but his son's African-American friend Chilly.  The author paints a lush and absorbing physical and emotional protrait of two men struggling for survival under extreme circumstances.  The second vignette borrows heavily from Mark Twain, in both style and content.  Here Logan outwits a professorial villain, whose flowery elocution masks a pathetically craven heart.  This melodramatic chestnut of outlaws outfoxing other outlaws is saved only by Wells' love of his characters, his engaging use of Cajun patois and his keen sense of irony.  The final vignette, featuring an overpowering hurricane, blows itself out from predictablility.  It is as if the author himself became exhuasted from the excesses of his own writing.<br />&quot;Logan's Storm&quot; is cause, however, for rejoicing.  Its author, Ken Wells relishes spinning a good tale and is a marvelous scene setter.  Logan LeBauve, podnah, will happily find his own niche in our national pantheon of authentic American heroes.	2003-12-16

They are translators of broken dreams, betrayal, brutality.  As writer and readers, they recreate and relive the crushing pain of dispossession, abandonment and exclusion.  Their world is a distorted polarity of what ought to be in life.  Members of this universe ask themselves the question of how people can endure historical pain:  genuine hurt of the here and now whose roots are tangled in the soil of prejudice, repression and complicity.<br />To this body of literature may now be added Julie Otsuka's incandescent \\"When the Emperor Was Divine.\\"  This spare, elegant and wrenching debut novel is destined to become a classic in any serious examination of the impact of the forced removal and relocation of over 110,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans during World War II.  Otsuka's nameless protagonist family becomes representative, not only of the agonizing, degrading and damaging impact of racism but also of assault on racial identity.  The family's coerced odyssey  --  from forced removal to isolative segregation to bewildered return  --  offers no happy ending, no comfort, no solace of redemptive suffering.  The four members of this family, stripped of identity by a prejudice-saturated larger population, are victims and martyrs, made heroic by survival but not blessed or redeemed by enduring wrongful hardship, deprivation or ostracism.<br />Otsuka is so masterful at her craft tht practically each sentence, each phrase carries an explosive impact.  Why the Japanese-Americans?  Their \\"crime,\\" Otsuka explains, is their being \\"too short, too dark, too ugly, too proud.\\"  Who are they?  \\"I'm the one you call Jap ... Nip ... Slits ... Slopes ... Yellowbelly. .. Gook.\\"  Through the lens of Otsuka's analysis, the Japanese-Americans suffered the dual curse of invisibility and ubiquity.  Their very insignificance led to their perceived danger; their complete assimilation proved their insidious disloyalty.  From this cauldron of psychological terrorization can only come horrible results.  Shame.  Apology for being.  Bewildered submission.  Denial.  Rejection.<br />By not permitting readers to know the names of the mother, father, son and daughter of her representative family, by enforcing a sense of anonymity, Otsuka creates a world of detached, impersonal horror, magnified by terribly real, painful, particular detail.  The author's terse, precise and understated language intensifies imagery, metaphor and symbol.  Even Otsuka's use of prepositional phrases shimmers.  Topaz Relocation Camp is a city \\"of tar paper barracks behind a barbed wire fence on a dusty alkaline plain high up in the desert.\\"  Staccato one-sentence paragraphs hammer home the essence of this assualt on \\"time and space:\\"  \\"No Japs allowed to travel...\\" or \\"No Japs out after eight p.m.\\"  In Otsuka's hands, the single-word epithet \\"Jap\\" embodies every indignity, slight and attack the Issei and Nisei faced.<br />Symbolism in \\"Emperor\\" is subtle, unobtrusive and compelling.  The mother's willed euthanasia of a milkey-eyed, disregarded neighborhood dog foreshadows and intensifies her husband's abrupt disappearance and demise.  Otsuka forces us to listen to the son's recitation of \\"My country, 'tis of thee\\" and the pledge of allegiance against the backdrop of incessant dust  --  which creates its own unwelcomed bur irreversible scrim of shame.  How could it ever be possible to come clean from this unbidden dirt, this grimy degradation?  We are forced to witness the silent erosion of family coherence through obligatory meals in communal mess halls where Japanese customs are indelicately ignored.  No painful detail escapes Otsuka's eyes, not even the distasteful practice of foods touching each other on dinner plates.  Topaz is not only geographically sterile, but existentially barren.  When asked what he had done one winter day, the boy responds, \\"Licked a stamp.\\"<br />As necessary and brilliant as \\"When the Emperor Was Divine\\" is, it walks a dangerous line.  Julie Otsuka's insistence on her family's anonymity risks that readers may not be able to identify and understand her protagonists' circumstances and pain.  Namelessness risks distance, and distancing imperils connection.  Yet because she takes that risk, her novel is even a greater triumph.  \\"When the Emperor Was Divine\\" honors memory and invites reflection.  It presents us with the greatest weapon available to fight oppression:  an informed heart, one fashioned by exposure to wrong and an understanding of wrong's imapct.	2003-12-04

Emily Jenkins' winning debut novel, \\"Mister Posterior and the Genuis Child\\" creates a memorable eight-year-old protagonist in Vanessa, who most endure growing up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a home where her single mother,Debbie, tries to navigate the currents of consciousness-raising, alternative education and sexual satisfaction.  Vanessa's voice rings true; her complex personality invites empathy and her myriad school and home experiences delight, horrify and illuminate.  \\"Posterior\\" features an impressive, fast-paced narrative which enhances Jenkins' sharply-etched characters and invests their foibles with sympathy instead of disdain.<br />Vanessa is a sensitive, precocious child who is acutely aware of her marginal status at a progressive, counter-culture, purportedly child-centered school.  Chafing at her suddenly obvious differences, Vanessa alternates between rejecting her distinctiveness and embracing it.  Upon discovering her status as a scholarship student  --  a poor kid from a poor, single-parent family  --  and ingesting a classmate's comments on her being different, Vanessa remarks that \\"it felt like confirmation of something I had known all along.\\"<br />Her mother, whom Vanessa resolutely calls Debbie, struggles with her own baggage.  \\"The only child of two blisteringly spotless people,\\" Debbie rebels through diet and her own steadfast belief in her daughter's right to be.  Debbie repudiates her parents' \\"veneer of shiny white happiness\\" as she flails away at her solitary life.  Dating a seemingly endless array of losers, Debbie unwittingly increases the velocity of Vanessa's maturation by hiring a babysitter, whose adolescent fixation on boys augments a budding curiosity in Vanessa.<br />This desire to know, to question leads Vanessa into conflictwith quasi-permissive (but secretly manipulative and lazy) teachers whose premise of allowing children to prgress at their own pace runs afoul of their unwillingness to instruct and guide.  A member of the \\"Super Spellers,\\" Vanessa includes explicit sexual vocabulary in a hilarious script she was voluntarily coerced into writing.  The episode reveals not only her vivid imagination but also the utter blindness of school authorities to authentic childhood creativity.<br />Vanessa adamantly refuses to perceive herself as a victim, and this core resiliency carries her through the central crisis of the novel:  an exhibitionist whose bare bottom alarms her mother, babysitter and neighborhood but merely amuses her.  Vanessa's unflinching belief in herself  --  a self defined by imagination, play and discovery  --  serves as a model of behavior, not just for children, but for adults as well.<br />\\"Mister Posterior and the Genuis Child\\" is vibrant and engaging.  Its author, Emily Jenkins, invests her protagonist with an informed childhood sensibility, one open to hurt and fear, but even more receptive to the wondrous, messy possibilities of life.	2003-12-04

Where Malamud indicts hypocrisy and greed in the all-American sport of baseball, Jackson explores the troubled aspects of individual motivation, excellence and isolation in the less-acclaimed activity of long-distance running.  Jackson's troubled, conflicted protagonist, Kevin Schuler, discovers speed after a devastating accident claims the life of many of his teammates and girlfriend, but he discovers neither solace or satisfaction from his sudden, unbidden prowess.  &quot;Life&quot; reveals a tormented soul alienated and removed from hinmself, disdaining recognition but yearning for understanding and acceptance.<br />After learning of the demise of his friends and girlfriend, Kevin literally runs from his pain.  Numbed by anguish and horrified by his own lack of affect, Kevin seeks solace in running.  Rigorous individual routines only serve to reinforce his sense of guilt and indirect responsibility.  Records melt under his fleet feet, but he hears only silence as he attains what appears to be a state of grace on the track.  Throughout high school, Kevin's letter jacket gains pounds as a result of his medals, trinkets that only serve to weigh him down spiritually.  His repeated astonishing victories, some earned despite vicious opponents and his own disdain for transcendence, ironically defeat his quest for self-understanding, tolerance and forgiveness.<br />Jackson is not content with merely exploring atheltics' false claims of redemption and personal transformation.  Through a series of withering character sketches and devastating social commentaries, the author lashes out against corrupt high-school administrators, insidiously evil colllege recruiters and a pathetically vacuous public, bent on adoration of athletic icons without any understanding of the athletes' personal needs.  Jackson's conclusions about the condition of school athletics are dire.  He punctures the myth of athletics building character through Kevin's exploitation at the hands of university medical &quot;researchers.&quot;  The illusion that the pristine, individual nature of track and field is exempt from commercial tarnish evaporates as institutions seek to advance their interests often at the expense of a talented athlete.<br />This is not to say that &quot;Life&quot; is without humor.  In fact, Jackson displays a tartly sarcastic, ironic note throughout his fast-paced, semi-allegorical writing.  His delightful choice of proper nouns for minor charcters and place names (Zame Smith High School, for instance) emphasize his perception that the entire sports scene in high school is at best skewed, off-center, perverse.  Jackson knows how to intertwine fable, commentary and satire, and he invests his protagonist with a genuine humanity.  Kevin emerges burdened, bowed but completely authentic.  &quot;Life at These Speeds&quot; is a welcome addition to a body of sports literature that believes we can learn much of ourselves through exploration of one of our most cherished national icons, the athletic hero.	2003-11-21

Her &quot;The Last Girls&quot; explores the serious themes of identity, aging and lost love through the eyes of four middle-aged women, former college friends, suddenly reunited as the result of the sudden death of a classmate.  The four sedately recreate their impetuous collegiate raft trip undertaken in 1965, when they were a group of twelve &quot;girls,&quot; all on the cusp of adulthood.  Now on a cruise paddlewheeler comfortably navigating the formerly daunting waters of the Mississippi River, the women realize that, despite some being broken by life, others straining against the restrictions and boundaries imposed on them by a conformist, male-centered society, the ties that bind have endured.<br />Smith permits each of the four women to reveal her particular circumstances; her braided, layered techniques permit smooth transition from past to present, woman to woman.  The four are tied by their common link to the rebellious, charismatic Baby, whose storied collegiate exploits reverberate still on the Mississippi.  Each woman carries the burdens of the past and ominous, unsettling pressures of the present.  Their crises, from physical fears to marital discontent; from the costs of fame to the quiet anguish of solitary living; from the mundane to the existential, seem to drive the women to a needed, but unspoken companionship.  Yet restraint and ambiguity silently tap and tarnish intimacy and full disclosure.  The result, compelling but depressing, is a waltz of adult women yearning to recapture youthful friendships but unable to let loose fully enough to discover the answer to the elusive questions of personal fulfillment and happiness.<br />Easily the most sympathetic character is Harriet, Baby's closest collegiate confidante, now a lonely, muffled woman.  Through Smith's subtle and sympathetic characterization, Harriet emerges as a symbolic everywoman, determined to live but uncertain as to how.  Her anguish, confusion and terror, often portrayed with a bittersweet, wry tone, outshine the three other women's personalities.  Harriet's life resembles the very river she is once again confronting:  deep, murky and unexpectedly dangerous.  To Smith's credit, Harriet has yet to make a set of crucial decisions by novel's end.<br />This is not to say that &quot;The Last Girls&quot; is Lee Smith's finest work.  It lacks the depth and intensity of previous novels set in the past and featuring women struggling against more compelling forces.  Nevertheless, the author's most recent novel sympathetically reveals the texture of women's friendships in the context of generational change and emotional transformation.	2003-11-20

In \\"Fourteen,\\" Zanichkowsky has drawn a portrait of a home mangled by its size, stunted in ints physical and emotional repressions, fractured by loss of individuality and self-determination.  Scarred and bowed by this tormented past, Zanichkowsky nevertheless has marshalled the courage to recall his past and summoned the courage the unflinchingly recount it.  \\"Fourteen\\" hurts to read and stands as a sober warning  --  not only about excessive family size, but about lack of connection between parents and their children.<br />The subtitle of the memoir, \\"Growing Up Alone in a Crowd,\\" symbolizes the alienation  --  from parents, siblings and self  --  Zanichkowsky experiences in his childhood homes.  Traditional social anchors, such as the Catholic Church, school and neighborhood, cannot compensate for the fact that \\"our parents hadn't loved us.\\"  The sheer number of children and their quick, regular appearance obliterate coherence, quality of life and a sense of acceptance.  The \\"brutality of motherhood\\" transforms Johanna Zanichkowsky into a resigned, bewildered and defeated woman, one who gains solace from God but not from family.  Her maniacal penchant for violence clashes dissonantly with her near fatalistic resignation and frightening apathy towards her children.  Stephen's father, Martin, omnipotent and wrathful, dominates the home; he is never reluctant to dispense absolutely bestial beatings with \\"the stick,\\" a much-used hardwood bed slat.<br />Amidst the chaotic \\"motion and commotion,\\" Stephen drives himself to \\"seek comfort and salvation in solitude.\\"  He does so burdened that not only will he never be understood, he must carry the shame that the \\"possibility of understanding myself\\" will be forever closed.  Education and school, instead of liberatinghim, freeze Stephen to a sense of separation.  The strangeness of his family, exacerbated by sexual ambivalence, compels him to confront differences.  He is no more successful than his brothers or sisters in attaining an intact sense of self.  Unloved and untethered, the Zanichkowsky children engage in theft, sexual exploration and violation, and dissociative behaviors which dog them even as adults.<br />Fear is the corrosive element defining the children's relationships with their parents.  Avoidance of punishment creates distanced, amoral and pragmatic children, whose simmering resentments must be sublimated and displaced.  The Zanichkowsky household, at is elemental level, is an ongoing laboratory of Hobbseian despair  --  it is mean, nasy, brutish, but never short.<br />Reading \\"Fourteen\\" requires patience and empathy.  The author seeks the written word as therapy, and despite his lean, powerful prose, Stephen Zanichkowsky holds out no false promise for himself.  \\"Fourteen\\" is unrelentingly honest, and the inspired purity of his distilled memories and keenly-felt realizations educate.  Readers can only imagine the true costs on the author.	2003-10-29

Exposed to the simmering daily-life tensions of an Irish Catholic blue-collar Philadelphia neighborhood, he struggles to find the magic to convince Grace McClain to marry him.  Not only is this lovestruck fourteen-year-old consumed with the details of his imminent proposal, he fervently hopes that his public romantic proclamation will untie the knots of unhappiness constricting his family.  Hank is witty, abrasive, intrepid and drop-dead funny; his creator, author Shawn McBride, not only captures Hank's voice, he faithfully recreates the malestrom of emotions prepubsecent boys encounter on their bumpy road to manhood.  \\"Green Grass Grace\\" is an unqualified success.<br />Hank's world view rotates around bra cup sizes, and his penchant for visually measuring every woman (including his own mother) comes in second place only to his compulsion to keep his hair perfectly coiffed.  His sidekicks, the business-savvy but quintessentially nerdy Harry; schoolboy lethario Bobby and wheelchair-ridden Archie scour St. Patrick Street, observing and augmenting its subterranean and overt chaos.<br />Hank's infectious love of life, however, is tempered by the fightening knowledge that things are terribly askew at home.  His father, Frances Toohey Junior, diverts his rage at a squandered life by having a scarcely-concealed affair with a neighbor.  Perceptive, sarcastic Cecilia, Hank's beleaguered mother, walks a tightrope of acceptance and rebellion; despair rivals laughter as she copes with a disintegrating family and her own blight.  Tormented by the death of his intended, Stephen, Hank's older brother, drowns his sorrow and numbs his feelings with alcohol; he comes to symbolize every dashed hope and derailed dream young men experience en route to hapless, pointless adult lives in mid-1980s Philly.<br />Depression never conquers Hank, as his focus steadies on Grace, a brazenly autonomous, astoundingly alluring young woman whose age belies her hard-won wisdom and steel-willed fearlessness.  Grace's presence arouses Hank, and the literal manifestations of that arousal will remind every male reader of that painfully pleasureful introduction to sexual self-awareness.  His romanticization of life's responsibilities lend a bittersweet quality to this fine debut novel.<br />\\"Green Grass Grace\\" recognizes urban emotional corrosion; \\"it's all channel changing and nose blowing\\" in Philly's repetitive row houses.  Nonetheless, Hank declares war on joylessness, on the people who \\"bury the best of their love,\\" who \\"lose chances, waste time, miss life.\\"  He refuses to back down to sadness, instead vowing to \\"inflict the Toohey Chop Suey on the hard-hearted.\\"  In Shawn McBride's sure hands, Hank emerges as a modern Don Quixote, and our fondest hope is that he never stop tilting at his St. Patrick Street windmills.	2003-10-20

Ms. Joseph directs her energies to exploring the different perspectives men and women bring to loving each other, how homosexuality confirms and contradicts societal expectations and in what ways do children bring joy and anguish to their parents.  &quot;Bear Me&quot; treats identity loss, existential despair and social intolerance with uncommon dignity and depth.<br />Although each character develops a distinct and believable personality, the two step-brothers, Curtis and Paul, rivet the reader's attention.  It is through their dynamic that &quot;Bear Me&quot; creates dramatic tension and thematic resolution.  Both men are broken and searching.  The manly Curtis despises and is threatened by his step-brother Paul's promiscuous homosexuality.  The former never achieves clarity as to exactly what his feelings are:  rage, envy, frustration and revulsion compete with attraction, jealousy and acceptance.  In turn, Paul wears his sexuality like Joseph's coat of many colors.  At once deeply monogamous in attitude, he flaunts his numerous sexual partners in the face of both parents and his one consuming love.  He is a broken young man, acutely aware of his familial status, despondent at the repressive, regressive rural Georgia social environment in which he must survive, shattered that he is not able to connect with Curtis.<br />As one of the women in &quot;Bear Me&quot; tartly notes, &quot;Men aren't always fixable.&quot;  This becomes one of the central metaphors of the novel.  Paul's loving step-mother, perhaps the only older character who truly yearns to embrace him, is repulsed by Paul's tormentors, who &quot;give her the creeps.&quot;  These oft-violent cruel homophobes, &quot;contained, self-righteous, humorless,&quot; include her own son, Curtis.  This knowledge buries her under an intolerable weight of guilt and responsibility, yet she is unable to either reach Curtis or repair his own frozen heart.  Nor can Curtis' vibrant, independent fiance, Sidra, control events with any more talent.  Despite her open and refreshing friendship with Paul, one crafted to assuage the hurt of her own broken heart, she cannot open Curtis to the possibility of connection with Paul.<br />The structure of &quot;Bear Me Safely Over&quot; tends to diminish its power, however.  Each chapter is told through a different character's point of view.  While this provides a refreshing and dynamic series of perceptions to the narrative, it also saps the novel of cohesion and energy.  Much of &quot;Bear Me&quot; reads as self-contained short stories, interlinked but independent.  Nevertheless, this minor qualm pales in comparison to the integrity and beauty of Sheir Joseph's writing.  Her brave examination of the dangers and possibilities of loving relationships has no easy answers, no pat resolution.  It does, however, illuminate the terrible consequences of spurning affection and rejecting hope.	2003-10-09

Nearly four-hundred tiresome pages long, King's novel does not lack plot or moral insight;[...]  Featuring prose of a decidedly purplish cast, dialogue resembling rehashed daytime soaps and characters so outrageously unidimensional that they often could appear as cartoon characters speaking with bubbles above their heads, \\"The Sunday Wife\\" drowns in its excesses.<br />This overkill is unfortunate, as King does attempt to explore themes of marital instability, religious hypocrisy and the dangers of living an unexamined life. With greater subtlety and more respect for her readers' ability to generate informed judgments, her protagonist, Dean Lynch, could have emerged as not only sympathetic, but profound.  She is a prototypical \\"Sunday wife\\" and terribly compromised by her suffocating responsibilities as the partner to a minister.  <br />Dean's dilemmas are shopworn, her ambivalences become tiresome and her ultimate decision predictable from the first chapter.  Her execrable husband, a porcine overachiever whose religious homilies tragically are perceived as elemental truths by millions of Americans today, deserves to float away by the gas produced as a result of his prodigious appetite or explode as a consequence of his pompous pronouncements.<br />All the standard plot devices and tired cliches make their obligatory appearance: a child of undefined parentage, a mysterious gypsy fortune teller, and, yes, a nefarious older minister with a past he wishes to forget but, alas, cannot.  Dean's dulcimer soothes the savage breast, and Ms. King never tires to reminding her audience that Dean has struggled to overcome her white-trash origins.  <br />If you are deficient in bloodsugars and don't mind a novel where you can skip fifty pages at a shot without losing a step, \\"The Sunday Wife\\" is for you.  My guess is that Cassandra King's novel about misplaced faith could make atheists out of believers.	2003-10-01

Her publisher, Ballantine Books, decided to republish three of her earlier works, and \\"Alamo House\\" will remind us that as early as 1986 (when \\"Alamo\\" was first published), Ms. Bird possessed talent as both a social observer and satirist.  Her abilities continued to grow, and her most recent novel, \\"The Yokota Officers Club,\\" firmly established her place in modern literature.   \\"Alamo House\\" allows us a chance to learn how Ms. Brid's talents have matured and grown.<br />\\"Alamo House\\" ladels out sarcastic observations about decadent fraternity life, women's attempts to batttle against obnoxious male adversaries and students' quixotic jousts into adulthood.  Every character is delightfully skewed, and Bird gives each just enough humanity to captivate our imagination and invite our sympathies.  Recalling or recoiling against her own days as a graduate student at the University of Texas, Bird paints a grim, warped picture of undergraduate males, residing in an alcoholic-induced stupor at the appropriately-titled SUK fraternity.  When not hosting midnight parties  --  replete with music played at decibel levels more appropriate for a rock concert, drunken men engaging in projectile vomiting contests and lascivious undergrads trying to ply willing sorority sisters with enough alcohol to unfurl condoms  --  SUK seems to live only to torment the depressed denizens of Alamo House.<br />As benighted as is the SUK house, the Alamo House holds its share of sadsacks as well.  Repressed house leaders, grad students whose passion for esoterica is eclipsed only by their perpetual presence in college and an exchange student whose mispronunciations and malapropisms leave no doubt as to her understated wisdom  --  the women who initially are resigned to daily/weekly/monthly degradation need an awakening.<br />The cryptic and beautiful Collie, through her own words and actions, ignites rebellion, and the novel's protagonist, Mary Jo, senses both personal salvation and social consciousness through the charismatic, enigmatic Collie.  Joining these two women is Fayrene, whom Bird paints as so overweight that she literally has difficulty fitting into anything smaller than a tent.  As the three women galvanize Alamo House into acts of rebellion and genuine self-definition, the novel veers away from pure satire into an interesting discussion of the possibilities and limitations of 1980s feminism.<br />Bird never permits politics to interfere with fun, however, and she clearly enjoys poking holes into sacred cows, whether they be political icons like Lady Bird Johnson, incompetent professors (often drunk, oblivious or skirt-chasing) and post-graduate curriculum.  \\"Alamo House\\" is so humorous that the reader can simply point to any paragraph in the novel to discover some tart observation or hyperbolic exaggeration.  At times, the novel tends to be excessively frothy, nearly wallowing in its own descriptive detail.  Yet, its pace and punch never lose momentum, and Mary Jo's wacky odyssey becomes our own.	2003-09-21

As Miss Peggy, Dr. Maggie and Li'l Bit wrestle with their consciences  --  struggling to define the elusive ideas of justice, obligation and self-respect  --  they invite the reader into their world, a place where race, sex and social class define life's possibilities and inform self-definition.  Louise Shaffer's enthralling \\"The Three Miss Margarets\\" crackles with dramatic tension and vaults the reader in an engrossing saga of personal endurance, private tenacity and redemptive sacrifice.  The novel's pace is fast, but not so fast as to compromise Shaffer's exeptional talent in depicting the human heart in conflict with itself and how that heart learns to heal itself despite and because of friends, history and disappointment.<br />Each of the five women who comprise the core of \\"Three\\" bears the scars of loss and heartbreak.  The talented Dr. Maggie forsakes her sexuality to return to her childhood community; doll-like, Maggie's iron-bound will permits her to substitute service for personal joy and fulfillment.  Li'l Bit, gigantic and homely, accepts her status of town pariah but compensates with insight, tolerance and an abiding passion for natural beauty.  When Li'l Bit initially interviews for a position with Dr. Maggie, Li'l summarizes her self-image:  \\"I'm not pretty...don't tell me I'm handsome in my own way.  I can look in a mirror.  I know what I see.\\"  Li'l also senses Maggie's differences when she tells the doctor that \\"being important...useful\\" is \\"the standard way for people like us.\\"<br />This sense of singularity consumes the third member of this unusual friendship circle.  Miss Peggy, the youngest of the three, has only a spectacular figure and smoldering sexuality to define her identity as a teen.  That sensuality provokes pain, recoveryand determination  --  ingredients which also define Laurel, the illegitimate daughter of the town's reprobate floozy.  Laurel's anger at life's unfairness and her unflinching need to discover the truth of her family's past compel her to intervene in the life of the three older women. Tied to Laurel's search is Vashti, the granddaughter of Dr. Maggie's African-Ameican childhood friend.  The brilliant Vashti has paid a high price for her exceptional talent, a price which brings her home a final time to set the stage for confrontation with a tormented and repressed past.<br />Shaffer slowly peels away the facade of the three Margarets, and with each successive layer of truth exposed, resolution becomes more complicated.  In this respect, the author turns the aphorism  about truth setting us free on its head.  The Margarets, Laurel and Vashti pay a terrible price for the truth, and though it may be liberating, a sequestered truth may have served them better than an honest accounting.  How truth reconciles with lies, how proud women use the tools given them to combat sexism, racism and class prejudice, how love, reluctantly learned and eagerly embraced, gives courage and vision to the bereft are elegantly displayed in this marvelous novel.  <br />\\"The Three Miss Margarets\\" satisfies Faulkner's wise description that literature must be of the heart and not the glands.

This abominable hate crime opened up not only wounds but questions.  What is a transgendered person?  Is \\"it\\" a he, a she, or both?  In what ways do transgendered people challenge our notions of sexuality?  What does it truly mean to be a \\"man\\" or a \\"woman\\"?  Do any of us have the courage to confront misplaced identity as much as transgendered people muster?<br />As we confronted the reality of a hate crime and its attendant national publicity, forgotten was the humanity of the victim.  Noelle Howey's remarkable memoir, \\"Dress Codes,\\" achieves the near impossible; she makes a type a real human being.  Not only does Noelle's recount her father's evolution from Dick Howey to Rebecca Christine Howey, she does so with aplomb and humor.  Every page of this wrenching, honest work is absolutely human.  As a result, \\"Dress Codes\\" is in part angry, hopeful, remorseful and incredibly funny.  The author refuses to pull any punches, instead preferring to let her story (and wonderfully trenchant observations) inform her readers.<br />The subtitle of Howey's work instructs us that she will be treating three girlhoods, her mother's, her father's and her own.  Each person \\"comes out\\" and discovers not only the truth of his/her own sexuality, but the essence of his/her identity.  And the discovery is never neat, tidy or convenient.  Hearts break, marriage dissolves and a sensitive child must come of age, eventually unencumbered by the secrets of her family and the torment in her own soul.  There is sufficient grist for the human mill in each of the three central characters for three separate books.  Howey's skill as a writer emerges in her sensitive treatment of the interplay of mother, father and daughter, the intersection of sex, parenting and developmental growth through and between each of the three.<br />AsDick Howey transforms himself into Christine Howey, he becomes a she, and she develops a true humanity.  At the onset of Dick's journey into transgendered identity, he \\"saunters around his bedroom, feeling ashamed, prurient, dubious, criminal, insance, peculiar and eccentric.\\"  Not only that, he is also \\"completely at one with himself.\\"  Noelle's coming to grips with her father's sexuality, one born in suppressed knowledge, causes a severe disorientation during which she is \\"inhabiting a surreal landscape of opposites where black was white, and of course, male was female.\\"  Noelle bristles at sympathy; she \\"couldn't bear to have normal people feeling sorry for me.\\"<br />Quietly, unobtrusively, but surely, Noelle's mother, Dinah, emerges as a gifted, compassionate and strong force.  Never once varying from her own sense of self, she suffers through the knowledge that not only did  her husband never feel content with his biological sexual identity,  but that social recrimination (ironically on her as much as him) would be the price she would pay for understanding.  Dinah remains a close friend to Dick/Christine, and in so doing, becomes a model of humanity, one desperately needed by the young adult Noelle who descends steeply into her own world of pain.<br />One day, hopefully in the not too-distant future, sociologists will read \\"Dress Codes\\" and shake their heads at the stunted attitudes most Americans held in the late twentieth century about sexual identity and expression.  Yet, at the same time, they will marvel at the authenticity of voice and the tenacity of spirit in this memoir.  Noelle Howey's words serve as a moral compass, and her work should become a staple of any enlightened secondary school's sex education curriculum.	2003-08-26
US	50747195	RQ8U5PDR9J0LA	0811834956	172358476	And My Shoes Keep Walking Back to You	Books	3	2	4	N	N	frothy, robust but predictable "Shoes" charms and delights	Fast-paced and energy-filled as a Texas two-step, Kathi Kamen Goldmark's debut novel, \\"And My Shoes Keep Walking back to You\\" lovingly captures the zest, tensions and chaos of the life of country music recording stars.  There is no question that Goldmark revels in the excitement and possibility of the music she enthusiastically examines.  Her protagonist, sexy, uninhibited and talented Sarah Jean Pixlie, comes to symbolize the aspirations, creativity and hopes not only of a rising music star, but of any young person caught up in the first flush of artistic success.  The novel's strengths derive from its narrative power and its ability to distill the volcanic cycle of hope, achievement and disillusion through an enormously appealing and eminently sympathetic character.  However, \\"Shoes\\" often sounds like a song played one too many times, descending into predictability, its plot and themes overworked and repetitious, much like a number one hit losing its punch.  The novel certainly entertains but seldom informs.<br />If you can overlook these weaknesses and can stomach characters who are so far hell-bent and whiskey-bound that their transparencies are endearing rather than grating, the novel packs a solid emotional wallop.  Goldmark does not shy away from challenging Nashville icons or manipulative corporate executives.  She pays dutiful and educated homage to country music's roots and uniquely American tang.  Her characters, all grappling with lost, damanged or unrequited love, resonate.  This is an author who has gusto for life and a skyrocketing belief in the possibilities of love.<br />Sarah Jean Pixlie surrounds herself with music; her iconoclastic Jewish mother and talented, restless father encourage her talents.  Pixlie writes her own songs based on her own life's experiences: her lyrics range from romanced to motherhood, from a cheatin' heart to potty training.  As a rising star, emerging from a career as a backup harmony singer, she relies on her inner self to navigate the choppy waters of ambition, success and fame.  All the while, she tries to reconcile her vocational calling  --  her music  --  with the songs of her own heart  -- a longing for companionship and completion.<br />Goldmark composes the songs her Sarah Jean belts out.  The author, a San Francisco songwriter and performer, skillfully transforms her own experiences into her literary self.  Direct, ebullient and raw-edged; racous, sex-saturated and edgy, \\"Shoes\\" lacks depth and texture.  But its love of life, its abundant sensuality and its wide-open appreciation of country music make you forget any complaints.  Pay the cover charge, get a little drunk and enjoy the sounds.	2003-08-17

Her mother, Miriam, beautiful and self-destructive, is delusional, self-absorbed and negligent; Miriam lies, steals and creates false identities for herself.  Lucy, however, cannot stop loving her, needing her and identifying herself as a daughter.  Nicole Stansbury's exceptional portrait of a terribly skewed mother-daughter relationship, \\"Places to Look for a Mother,\\" rakes our sensibilities and startles us to recognize a pattern of life we know exists but would prefer to pretend away.  This debut novel is nothing less than astonishing.<br />There is an unrelenting hurt, an unceasing sadness which envelopes Lucy.  At an early age she is aware of her mother's sexy, sensual body and enormous but unsatisfied appetites.  A conventional marriage to her staid husband Bob cannot slake Miriam's hunger for life which snakes \\"like an electrical current\\" through the family.  Such electricity sets off sparks which ultimately destroy the rapidly unravelling fabric of the Taylor family.  Lucy observes that with her mother, \\"it was all hiding, all knots.\\"  Men \\"went crazy for her,\\" and Miriam's ever-changing sense of self and insatiable need to be needed bubble to the surface as she concocts strategies for abandoning her husband.<br />Despite Lucy's steadfast loyalty to her father and heartfelt fear and sympathy for her mother, she learns to press for her own identity.  This despite Miriam's despicable forced complicity of Lucy in Miriam's fantasized (and soon realized) departure from Bob.  As Lucy meanders with her equally beleaguered and hardened older sister Jen to different locales and male companions for Miriam, she witnesses false maternal identities and sequentially failing relationships.  Lucy painfully evolves from childhood to adolescence  --  observing, battling against but never escaping Miriam's disintegration.  \\"Places\\" is written from a crucible of pain and a vortex of psychological abuse.<br />Every attempt ata new life seems doomed to blight, a premature flower bud ruined by a sudden deep freeze.  On one occasion, in the midst of another blasted attempt at love, mother and daughter lament their \\"skinny chance at happiness\\" and \\"sat grieving\\" at the sight to six brutally mistreated huskies.  The dogs, like the   two women who observe them, detest the man who abuses them, but adore him nevertheless.  Watching her mother desperately search and wander, Lucy realizes \\"we were all on the lam, making soft sounds on the dust as we landed.\\"<br />The emotional landscape of the Taylor women is one of tears and violence, punctuated by periods of calm where false hopes flicker behind a facade of implausible lies, bad men and false dawns.  \\"That was our household, women crying everywhere you looked.\\"  Constant struggle underscores a sense of misplaced, lost love and a bittersweet sense of how life's brutal mishaps can knock askew any person's legitimate hopes for happiness.<br />Lucy Taylor only hopes to love her mother, but \\"all we ever did was fight.\\"  To accept that her mother \\"once loved me and that maybe she still did\\" requires extraordinary courage and painful introspection.  This sense of dignity and indominability, always understated and frequently inferred, elevates Lucy's character.  How can a child emerge intact  --  scarred and chipped as she may be  --  after enduring such a dislocating early life?  Through Nicole Stansbury's uncompromising characterizations, pitch-perect dialogue and thematic integrity, \\"Places to Look for a Mother\\" provides stirring answers.	2003-08-16

This sensitive, eloquent commentary bespoke an understanding not only of art, but of life itself.  It it a gift of seeing, and it is exploring that gift which constitutes the challenge and triumph of Cammie McGovern's exquisite &quot;The Art of Seeing.&quot;  Her debut novel traces the evolution of the troubled and nuanced relationship between two talented and tormented sisters, equally troubled by the limits and possibilities of their own vision.  McGovern's insights are subtle and quiet, their strength owing to the complexities of her character's personalities and the painful interplay betweem them. &quot;Seeing&quot; resonates with truths, not the least of which is that love often exists between people despite the mistakes they make with and for each other.<br />Jemma, the youngest of the sisters, labors suggestively in the shadow of her older sister Rozzie.  Begrudingly acquiesing to subordinate status, Jemma, at five years of age, realizes that she is &quot;a pathway to my sister's approval&quot; and &quot;as easy as breathing&quot; determines to accept this role.  Alienated and sensitive to her differences (both outside and inside her family), Rozzie exploits Jemma's willingness to do &quot;whatever is required to ensure...she will never be truly seen again.&quot;  The two develop a balance based on misgiving, silence and perceived acceptance of role; in reality, both envision themselves intertwined with the other in a complicated mathematics of expectation, subservience and dependence.  Although as an actress Rozzie appears distanced and detached, Jemma's choice of photography as a means of artistic expression requires identical traits.  <br />The metaphor of vision haunts both sisters.  As Rozzie loses her sight, she fights the very invisibility she affected.  Jemma's photography tends tofocus on isolation and periphery, and as she begins to study the dynamics of her relationship with her sister, ruefully admits that in her own way, &quot;I am missing too.&quot;   If clarity sets humans free, both Jemma and Rozzie have built walls, shutting down their capacity to see themselves and each other as authentic people.  Both women, talented in portrait and interpretation, lack the art of seeing their own hearts.  This terrible irony lends a tragic tint to their relationship, but to McGovern's credit, the author does not exploit it for sentimental purposes.  Instead, the author encourages her characters to use their deficiencies as the basis for renewal and change.<br />Consequently, Cammie McGovern elects to challenge readers to reflect on the limits of their own observations.  Have we unfairly sided with either of the two sisters?  Are we blinded by our own perceptions?  What must people do to attain a sense of artistry in their own sight?  Jemma and Rozzie quietly grapple with not only their own individual artistic imperatives; they use their talents to retrain their hearts.  &quot;The Art of Seeing&quot; becomes its title, a work of art that permits us a clearer vision of ourselves.	2003-08-15

Joe Martin's \\"Fire in the Rock,\\" a sensitive and provocative examination of race, friendship and the influence of the past, is a stunning work.  Not only does \\"Rock\\" compel us to participate in a thoughtful dialogue about race, the novel engages our heart through its brilliant characterizations.  Martin introduces us to people we come to care about deeply.  Through a stirring, subtle narrative, which spans the decade of the onset and flowering of the civil rights movement, change is constant, but the evolution of the characters is anything but fluid, as they are weighed down not only by race, but by the burdens of a racially-charged past.<br />The author requires patience from his readers.  Characters' names evolve; their identities, deftly nuanced, intensify and deepen as they come to grips with the tension engendered by struggle against racism and past restrictions.  Bigotry and violence, implicit throughout the novel, affect friendships, force personal confrontations and elicit either great courage or craven cowardice.  Change, often unpredictable, sudden and explosive, never occurs easily, and each character must battle not only nerves, but the weight of a veiled past.<br />\\"Rock\\" treats the complex, deep freindship between two young men:  Bo Fisher and Paul (Apollo) Templeton.  Idealistic and sensitive, Bo yearns to learn of the world, struggling against his status as the sheltered son of the town's liberal Presbyterian minister and his wryly assertive mother.  This earnest, naive white teen matures through and with his relationship with Paul, whose racial consciousness transforms him from figurative blindness to profound sight, from a shadowed existence to a piercing leadership in the civil rights movement, from insularity to engagement.  Through dialogue, books and play, Bo and Paul forge a friendship which challenges racial convention.  Martin's delightful incorporation of the Tarzan myth, and how it reflects and refracts Bo and Paul's perceptions, serves as a metaphor not only of the two men, but of the nation in which they are coming of age.  Ultimately, both men are informed and influenced by W.E.B. DuBois instead of racial fiction.<br />\\"Rock\\" contains provocative commentary on Southern identity.  Bo, on a trip to Philadelphia, discovers himself to the the outcast, the social pariah.  He muses about spoken and written English, ponders why Southerners are the ones said to have an accent instead of New Yorkers and Chicagoans.  Why don't publishers \\"render Southern accents with correct standard spelling and put the various Northern accents in dialect\\"?  In addition, the novel investigates the desire for and understanding of attraction, a drawing together of not only men and women, but Blacks and whites.  \\"Rock,\\" through the example of an elderly African-American storekeeper, brilliantly probes the impact of past horrific violence and the ability of its victims to incorporate horror and overcome the paralyzing influences childhood terror continues to exert as victims age.<br />Even in darkness \\"there ae moments of unmistabkable light.\\"  Through a narrative that gains momentum, characters who grab our strongest feelings and philosophical issues that challenge us to think, \\"Fire in the Rock\\" illuminates.	2003-08-01

How is it possible for a sensitive teen-ager to comprehend the significance of a mother's love when its source is no longer present?  How much should one risk for dreams, desires and hopes?  What is it about wanting that makes it so consuming, so overpowering?  Anne LeClaire's sensitive, lyrical and evocative coming-of-age novel, \\"Leaving Eden,\\" provides stunning, instructive answers.  Her protagonist, sixteen year-old Tallie Brock does not consider her hometown of suggestively-named Eden, Virginia to be paradise; nor does she realize that the knowledge she so earnestly seeks about life could compel her to an act of self-banishment.  <br />What Talie does know is heartbreak and abandonment.  Not once, but twice, does her mother leave her.  Blessed with Natalie Wood-like looks, Dinah Mae Brock wrestles with her own need to live out her dreams.  After Dinah Mae abruptly leaves her diligent, devoted husband Luddy for the hopes of realizing her life-long ambition of becoming a Hollywood stgar, her bright, inquisitive but disaffected daughter must confront her own demons and ask herself questions she is not initially prepared to confront.<br />Without the comfort and security of her mother, Tallie lacks \\"context\\" for her life and yearns to see the \\"whole picture\\" instead of the \\"jangly bits and pieces that didn't seem to fit.\\"  Insecure with her own physical appearance, a social outsider whose anxieties are exacerbated by an intolerably smug and critical maternal grandmother, Tallie has yet  to discover that \\"things don't always have to be laid out straight as string to make sense.\\"  Trying to make sense of his own loneliness, Luddy takes to drink to obliterate pain.   One parent dead, the other remote and silent, Tallie seeks answers through involvement in the Klip-N-Kurl beauty salon, where the town's women congregate to share gossip, secrets, and occasional comfort.<br />Just as quickly as she had left Eden, Dinah Mae returns, but with even more unanswered questions.  The novel pivots around the issue of unresolved dreams and wants.  Both mother and daughter must face how to fulfill the lives they have been given while being true to themselves and the one they love.  In desperation, Tallie turns to the town's pariah \\"witch,\\" whose Queen of Cures causes more consternation to Tallie than comfort.  Tallie muses, \\"It's hard to figure out what will kill you and what will cure you\\" and even more difficuilt to figure out the difference, she unknowingly sets an outline for her own life.<br />The second abandonment is even more wrenching, more final as Tallie must observe her mother's unsuccessful battle with cancer.  LeClaire is nothing less than brilliant in her exploration of an adolescent's existential anguish and resounding pain at the loss of a beloved parent.  Tallie yearns to have her mother tell her \\"everything\\" she needs to know about life.  As she rails at the unfairness of her mother's death, Tallie also castigates herself  for her own inability to ask the right questions, provide enough solace and deflect physical pain.<br />As Tallie discovers \\"wanting is a powerful thing,\\" she embarks on a bumpy road of self-discovery in which her sexuality, capacity for truth and ability to deceive combine to compel her to an act of self-defintion and discovery.  She learns that dreams, \\"the conceiving of possibilities that stretch\\" beyond the single person, necessarily must animate life; the act of want transcends its attainment.  Tallie ultimately will come to grips with one of life's greatest dilemmas, a choice between regret and remorse.<br />Interspersed in this fast-paced narrative are bite-sized morsels of Tallie's wisdom, written in her private journal.  Each aphorism derives from experience and love, from the intricate web of friendships Tallie has created in Eden and from the solitude of suffering and desire in her own heart.  Anne LeClaire has created a genuinely moving description of wisdom's costs and love's possibilities.  \\"Leaving Eden\\" will leave readers profoundly moved.	2003-07-18

Unfortunately, Pedersen's good intentions crumble under the weight of a predictable plot and characters who dutifully inspire but sadly never achieve full believability.  Despite possessing all the ingredients necessary for a delicious concoction, \\"Beginner's Luck\\" tastes much the same as many other similar novels.<br />Irreverent and brash, Hallie Palmer chafes under the restrictions of school and family life.  A capable gambler who succumbs to an ill-advised bet, she seizes upon employment as a yard person in the home of town eccentric Olivia Stockton and her gay son, Bernard.  During the course of a year's residence, Hallie sheds her edge while discovering the core values of her life.  Assisting her is the redoubtable Olivia, champion of every liberal cause, who, in her sixties, has the energy and temerity of a woman three times younger than she.  One of the weaknesses of the novel is that Pedersen seems content that Olivia never attain a true dimension in her character.  Olivia teeters on the edge of stereotype throughout.<br />This same weakness plagues her son, Bernard, a bon vivant who excels in the kitchen.  Successful in the antique business, Bernard is most at home creating meals that would blow away the greatest chefs.  How the residents of the Stockton household can pack away his creations with no effect on their waistline is an even more perplexing mystery than that of stolen money Pedersen inserts to keep her shopworn plot moving.  Bernard and his lover Gil are so honorable, ethical and dependable that they may well be nominated for \\"Most Acceptable Gay Figures in Literature.\\"  <br />\\"Beginner's Luck\\" does not need to have grim tragedy or trendy dysfunction to stimulate interest.  It should have, however, charfacters who stumble, agonize and thrash about with their lives.  Much is made of the clutter of the Stockton household, where members seem to find order, not only in the home, but in their own emotional relationships with each other.  The novel, itself, could have used some emotional clutter and mess in which Hallie expresses confusion, makes errors, and comes to grips with her own ill-defined notions of family.  Although Pedersen honorably extols \\"connectedness...as a result of the stirrings within our own hearts\\" and praises loving bonds between people \\"whether we are near to one another or far apart,\\" she never provides dramatic tension through which this epiphany is achieved.<br />As a result, \\"Beginner's Luck\\" is neither a book about gambling with life or creating a recipe for meaning and coherence.  Instead, Laura Pedersen offers scoop after scoop of sweetness and light, the result of which is a yearning for something more substantial.  Young women like Hallie genuinely suffer loneliness and existential anguish; they deserve something far more than a sojourn in a dream castle.	2003-07-14

Lost are the tension and violence of the era; the reader never is invited to understand the physical toll &quot;dead ball&quot; exacted from its participants.<br />What the reader receives is little more and little better than a Sporting News summary.  Facts abound and statistics flow, yet &quot;More than Merkle&quot; is stragely wooden, stilted.  Even the title character, Fred Merkle, whose baserunning blunder stands as one of the true milestones of the emerging national pasttime, hardly receives sufficient biographical treatment.  Reverence for numbers cannot substitute for making players come alive.<br />Dry, badly in need of editing and affectless, &quot;More than Merkle&quot; does contribute to our understanding of the role umpires played in pivotal contests, but does little else.

Their manager, Johnny Pesky, was a favorite of my father, a former batboy of the Atlanta Crackers and an impressive ballplayer in his own right.  One night, a leather-lunged idiot started in on Pesky, ridiculing him for a grievous mistake made in the 1946 World Series, held some three years before I was born.  In a rare show of public anger, my father shouted him down:  \\"You couldn't carry Pesky's jock, fathead.\\"  My dad then told me what he considered to be the truth behind the Cardinals' dramatic win over Pesky's Red Sox, now confirmed by one of America's great authors.<br />David Halberstam's loving tribute to the four men who composed the cornerstone of the majestic Boston teams of the 1940s, \\"The Teammates,\\" is a lyrical exploration of far more than baseball.  It is a fully-rendered celebration of friendship and commitment to excellence.  The genesis of this slim volume derives from the demise of Ted Williams and the determination of Dominic DiMaggio and Johnny Pesky, two of his beloved teammates, to visit the ailing giant one final time.  The fourth star in this unique constellation of friends, Bobby Doerr, would have joined them but for his tender and loving decision to remain in Oregon, caring for his stricken wife.<br />Halberstam is a masterful storyteller, and he marshalls his considerable biographer's skills in painting four compelling portraits.  His subjects share a common history of transcendence in the game; each brought a particular passion and grace to the game.<br />Dom DiMaggio emerges as a complete human being.  Earnest and aware of his own physical limitations, conscious of not even being the best ballplayer in his own family, Dom transforms intelligence and desire into not only a successful major league career, but a fully-formed adult life.  Johnny Pesky, who once shined minor leaguers' shoes in Portland, Oregon, embodies the essence of howbaseball survives as one of America's symbolic agents for cultural assimilation and upwards social mobility.  Never forgetting his roots and remaining true to his own identity, Pesky is the moral hero of the book.  Of the four, he had to bear the onus of being labeled a \\"goat,\\" responsible for the loss of the World Series.  Exuding strength, he never points a finger in any other direction, stoically accepting a wrongful reputation.  With a love of baseball so consuming, Pesky continued to actively coach his Sox in his eighties.<br />Graceful, reserved and balanced, Bobby Doerr has a moral center and balance so pure that his athletic prowess almost seemed predetermined.  This quiet, consistet man ironically becomes the closest friend to Ted Williams, the best hitter the sport has produced.  Profane and argumentative, Williams pontificates on every issue and invariably wins; this \\"man child,\\" Halberstam points out, may not have hit in 56 consecutive games, but he \\"won 33,277 arguments in a row...the undisputed champion of contentiousness.\\"  Williams, in Halberstam's sure hands, emanates energy and a zest for life; \\"outside the bounds of contemporary society,\\"  Teddy Ballgame approaches being an American archtype, a genuine self-defined man.<br />Thrughout \\"The Teammates,\\" a delight courses:  in baseball and friendship, in passion and performance, in dignity and endurance.  David Halberstam not only pays tribute to four men; more significantly, he gracefully shares with us the lessons they could still teach today.	2003-07-04

Set in the chaotic, brutal and traumatic final months of the Civil War in ravaged southeast Missouri, the novel brilliantly portrays both the undaunting courage of a solitary heroic protagonist and the ghastly indifference of war and nature to the human folly of control and order.  \\"Enemy Women\\" is at once a harrowing account of the consequences of fraternal warfare and an inspiring epic of a woman's quest for life.  It is a deeply satisfying and compassionate portrait of the possibilities of love.<br />The author has compressed the enormity of social cataclysm into a narrative of loss, exile and reclamation.  Adair Colley, as a headstrong, visionary eighteen-year old, resonates to the \\"smoke of her internal fire...every breath was a letter to the world.\\"  No sooner does her beloved father present her with a stunning horse, whose symbolic presence and absence permeate the novel, than she is forced to witness her father's degradation at the hands of a lawless, renegade band of quasi-legal federal soldiers.  War making is far from glorified in \\"Enemy Women,\\" although Jiles does permit Adair's brother, John Lee, to articulate warfare's lure to men.  The \\"great, silent driving forces\\" which inspire John Lee provoke vicious, atavistic violence in others.<br />Aswirl in this rip tide of detruction, Adair loses control of her life, fails to protect her sisters from depradation and finds herself in jail,  the result of false denunciation.  Wrongfully imprisoned, she discovers love in the person of her interrogator.  Deeply conflicted himself, Major William Neumann discovers authentic feelings for Adair.  This discovery compels him to undertake his own existential journey, one which will lead him through both philosophical and physical challenges.  Hepays dearly for his understandings.<br />Written in spare, poetic and tough language, \\"Enemy Women\\" is above all a work about costs.  Once Adair and William shed their naively antiquated notions of human beneficence, once they strip away their previously held and now preposterous notions that humans can control destiny, they discover the enormous toll the world takes on good people.  Civilization is little more than a \\"thin  tissue...a willed invention,\\" little thicker than the \\"fabric on a sail.\\"  Jiles' naturalistic descriptive skills highlight this dark interpretation of life.  Yet,  Adair and William, squeezed by physical want, disease and human depravity, emerge with newly burnished selves, inspired and inspiring.<br />Paulette Jiles goes to great pains to establish authenticity, beginning each chapter with first-hand Civil War documentation.  Judicious editing would have served her well, as the evidence becomes repetitious and excessively lengthy. This minor flaw, however, does nothing to diminish this brilliant novel.  \\"Enemy Women\\" is an incredible debut novel provocative, moving and compelling, it introduces a marvelous protagonist who is everything but an enemy.	2003-06-25
US	50747195	R1QWNDH0NNR50E	0786867019	940417470	Fanny and Sue: A Novel	Books	5	3	4	N	Y	identical twins come of age in gentle, detailed, wise novel	Talented author Karen Stolz has successfully repeated a formula which catapulted her debut novel, \\"World of Pies\\" to national prominence.  Stolz knows how to develop characters and confidently permits her readers to embrace her insights as their own.  She is absolutely unpretentious.  \\"Fanny and Sue,\\" a gentle, sweet and generous examination of identical twins coming of age during the Great Depression in St. Louis, reminds us of our capacity for family connection and allows a sheer wonder at the ties which bind.<br />These ties, which Fanny and Sue intuitively cherish, do not suffocate.  Indeed, one of the triumphs of this novel is its relaxed, but informed, technique of encouraging each character to emerge as a distinct person.  With voices that capture not only the innocence of relatively sheltered adolescent girls but of the time in our national past when common people extracted uncommon strength to face economic and medical traumas, \\"Fanny and Sue\\" is at once a social history and a delightful character study.<br />Headstrong, assertive and unafraid of take risks, Fanny drives the narrative.  Her impatience results in a scar on her arm which not only serves to distinguish her physically from her sister, but emotionally as well.  Reseved, introspective and intellectual, Sue grasps the complexity of her relationship with her dynamic and often overwhelming sister.  At once independent and symbiotic, the bond between the two is elastic enough to encouage individual epiphanies but profound enough to permit the two to live within the other's skin.  For instance, always uncertain as to her own appearance and lacking the effortless self-confidence of Fanny, Sue realizes that she was the \\"prettier one, not because my looks were improved\\" by Fanny's accident, but that her sister had been \\"altered\\" by her mild disfigurement.<br />Grandually accepting the fact that they will perceive the world differently, both Fanny and Sue convert divergence into an asset.  Fanny's love ofperformance and dreams of Hollywood may contrast from Sue's thirst for knowledge and her recognition of her passion for teaching, but both respect and encourage the development of ambition.  Their unsure, tentative but delighted forays into sexual expression remind us of a time when modesty and curiosity were genuinely expereinced by teen-aged girls on the cusp of adulthood.<br />Ms. Stolz has so fully integrated the nuances of Depression living that readers may forget how hard she has labored to created authentic ambiance.  Film titles, product tag-lines, meals designed for four stretched to feed eight, soda-jerking, husbands and wives selling wedding bands and marathon roller skating contests  --  all these details give \\"Fanny and Sue\\" a true down-home feel.  <br />This short, quiet and gentle novel serves to remind us that an author's love of her characters and respect for the beautifully complicated texture of everyday life are essential components of engaging modern literature.	2003-06-24

Her anecdotal style sparkles and her recipes are not only provocative, but understandable, even for amateur Yankee cooks and other such timid kitchen souls.<br />The members of West's family take larger-than-life shape in this memoir, and the author is unabashedly proud, both of their iconoclastic character and their abilities in the kitchen.  West does provide a modest warning:  her \\"Southern tales are like intricate recipes  --  part myth, part truth, and part lies.\\"  Her mother's insistence on an okra-free gumbo results in her swinging from a chandelier in protest.  Her aunt Dell's oversized appetite takes form in her collection of hairless cats, antiques and skewed instructions on food preparation.  Even her husband's attempt to raise bees falters when he mistakenly wears dark-colored socks.  In the midst of the author's affectionate observations of family eccentricities is her unflagging commitment to a joyous life.  Perhaps the most beautiful aspect of the numerous invitations to create in the kitchen is her acceptance of imperfection and failure.  West never stops trying, never stops of her sense of adventure, never ceases loving food and family.<br />When not enmeshed in rhapsodizing about food, West knows how to create food-based metaphor.  Disdaining gossip as a \\"main course,\\" she suggests that it \\"was more like an enticing appetizer, or a rich, sinful dessert.\\"  Partaking of gossip simply can't be helped, \\"even though you knew you'd be sorry later.\\"  Her family's obsession with food even has serious consequences.  When a coroner concluded that several men had died in their sleep of heart attacks,her \\"aunts knew better  --  it was death by butter.\\"<br />At its best, \\"Consuming Passions\\" reads quickly; its bite-sized chapters contain both humor and instruction.  At its worst, Ms. West's prose tends to have a purple cast, much like the sugared violets she recommends to cause sleep and dissolve anger.  Readers who admire Michael Lee West's fictional characters will enjoy her real-life versions; cooks who seek to broaden their repertoire will not be disappointed.  She invites you to dig in to the  liberating, sensual and powerful influence of food, best shared with people you love.	2003-06-10

Novelist Alice Mattison has summoned her considerable talents and created a series of characters and conflicts so real and so intense that it is easy to forget the beauty of her narrative.  \\"Hilda and Pearl\\" is a masterful work, one which reminds us of the beauty of friendship, the imperative of memory and the possibilities of forgiveness.  Set in the grim repressive atmosphere of McCarthyism, with skillful flashbacks to earlier decades and pivotal events, the novel traces the resiliency of the human heart when bruised by betrayal, confusion and loss.<br />The two featured protagonists develop a profound friendship, one rooted not only in the circumstance of marrying brothers, but nurtured by respect, need and fear.  Hilda and Pearl mutually confront interrelated conflicts, weighty enough that most friendships would wither and die, and emerge with their integrity and sense of self intact.  This is no easy task, as the women not only must face reciprocal recrimination but observe their husbands' relationship fracture as well.  Burdened by a restive child and unsettled by a husband whose career is threatened by a witch-hunt mentality, Hilda searches for a sense of peace and place, elusive and ephemeral.  Physically dissimilar, Pearl, whose long blonde hair and manifest physicality distinguish her, faces life without confidence or structure.  If Hilda is acutely analytical, Pearl is intuitive and accepting.  Hilda' sense of history contrasts with Pearl's ahistoric approach to life.<br />Parallel to the two women's encounter with frayed trust and broken dreams, Nathan Levenson and Mike Lewis suffer a deterioration of their bond.  Idealistic, patient and calm, Nathan ruefully observes his own demise after a brief association with communism in the 1930s.  Reminding him of the futility of political change is his assimilation-bound brother, Mike, who changed his last name in order to further his own career.  Angry, resolute and frustrated, Mike bears the full burden of betrayal, first by his wife and brother, then by his own broken dreams, and finally by his son, Simon.<br />Mattison advances the action of her novel through pivotal emotional explorations made by Hilda and Nathan's daughter, Frances.  Her persistent inquiry about a hidden pair of shoes becomes the string which, when pulled, unravels the secrets of the two households.  The author deftly interweaves Frances' coming-of-age with her parents descent into sorrow, recrimination and resolution.<br />There is no cheap grace in \\"Hilda and Pearl.\\"  Characters unflinchingly face the worst possible circumstances conspiring against loyalty, cohesion and trust.  The sheer beauty of how a tested friendship emerges from the crucible of doubt, the generous spirit which animates the women's resiliency and the authentic notion of redemptive love make \\"Hilda and Pearl\\" not only worth reading, but worth remembering.	2003-06-02

Written in staccato bursts of stream of consciousnessness vignettes which yearn for an editor's red pencil, \\"The Chelsea Whistle\\" valiantly attempts to not only narrate but explain how poverty and hopelessness blight lives.  Unfortunately, Tea spends far too much time describing events and cataloging abuses and far too little time analyzing their influence.  Sure, her horrific Chelsea, Massachusetts, the place where the American Dream goes to die, suffocates and submerges creative individualism and creative impulse.  Of course, the only families that city spawns are pathetically dysfunctional.  With Tea's ham-handed approach, readers will shrug their shoulders and say, \\"So what?\\"<br />The memoir is not completely without merit.  The author's candid appraisal ofher life, aswirl in class, ethnic, racial and religious prejudices provides ample opportunity for Tea's sardonic resentment to manifest itself.  The memoir bogs down, though, in the prosaic protests the author mounts; after all, how many song titles, dress styles and alcoholic drinks does it take to lead us to the inevitable conclusion that the author dissipated her physical and emotional self.  Never once does the author permit us to glance into her developing homosexuality; instead, Tea prefers titillation and presumed shock instead of peceptive self-evalution.  This omission is doubly galling as numerous young lesbians may well turn to this memoir for solace and solidarity.  What they will receive is stereotype and caricature.<br />There are serious stylistic flaws as well in \\"The Chelsea Whistle.\\"  Its author apparently does not believe in dialogue or quotation marks; instead, she prefers to wow the reader with capitalized letters for the spoken word.  Thisisn't artistic creativity, but a writer playing at trendy iconoclasm.  Even more pathetic is her presenation of a serious family trauma as the \\"deep dark secret only to be revealed late in the memoir.\\"  Once exposed, her epiphany is not apocalyptic but mundane, not horrifying but banal.  Tragically, Michelle Tea's suffering appears anti-climactic.  But then, why should her \\"catastrophy\\" be anything else but another flavor in her multi-scooped cone of despair.	2003-05-28

Despite these drawbacks, \\"Holler\\" does not flinch from an otherwise absorbing treatment of how two good people can become lost in their marriage.<br />Ave Maria and Jack Mac find themselves lost in the eighth year of their marriage.  Stgruggling with the sudden and catastrophic death of their son Joe, the two have an unspoken understanding that their relationship is fraying, perhaps beyond reclaim.  Jack discovers that his life-long dream to work in the mines has evaporated with job loss.  Ave Maria is unable to fill the void in her heart with acceptance and forgiveness; instead she seeks activities  --  in a pharmacy and on a medical emergency team  --  that supplant understanding.  In \\"Big Stone Gap,\\" Trigiani permits her characters to grow with the challenges of personal isolation and love at middle age; \\"Holler\\" is lamentably formulaic in its unwillingness to permit Ave Maria authentic opportunities for personal evaluation.<br />Instead of permitting Jack Mac and Ave Maria to explore the consequences of infidelity, both physical and emotional, Trigiani pulls back.  The author retreats to a safe distance, allowing Ave Maria to travel to Italy for a summer of purported contemplation and self-renewal.  Of course, she meets a new love interest.  Of course, she is ever so tempted.  Of course, she is animated by her discovery of \\"the other woman\\" in her husband's life.  All these realizations ring hollow and have the impact of a television movie of the week.<br />Even the minor characters, so intriguing and textured in \\"Big Stone Gap,\\" disappear into unidimensionality.  Nowhere is this more evidentin the shabby development of Theodore Tipton, whose homosexuality will be no suprise to readers of Trigiani's first novel but is somehow supposed to be astonishing to readers of the sequel.  His dynamic friendship with Ave Maria descends into convenience in \\"Holler;\\" he appears and disappears whenever a crisis occurs.  He dutifully offers sagacious advice, usually unheeded.  The women who compose the community of Big Stone Gap exist as foils to the plot; they are little more than scenic props to the emotional terrain Ave Maria must traverse in oder to solve her dilemma.<br />Even more irritating is the author's endless homage to Italy.  Ave Maria's summer sojourn in northern Italy reads more like a Tauck travel brochure than serious literature.<br />It is unfortunate the \\"Big Cherry Holler\\" has these weaknesses as the novel's treatment of love's integrative powers and fragility is serious and worthy of praise.  When Trigiani asserts that \\"it is easy to turn away from love entirely and choose to live alone in private fear,\\" she drives to the very core of the anguish any man or woman feels in determining how much to risk for love.  The author understands how love alters us and how difficult it is for people to ultimately determine how much and what they would do for it.  She is absolutely correct when she warns men that the \\"most important thing a father could do for his son was to love his mother.\\"  Her treatment of adult sexuality in marriage shines with compassionate understanding.<br />\\"Big Cherry Holler\\" is a conflicted novel.  Despite the fact that it successfully treats such serious adult themes as marital discord, sexual fulfillment and authentic love, the novel instead focuses on superficial glitz and comforting bromides.  Ultimately, readers will lament how Adriana Trigiani traded her opportunities for significant literature for something commercially palatable.	2003-05-17

Rarely does a subtitle so accurately depict the contents of a memoir as does their own: \\"A Holocaust Story of Love and Resistance.\\"<br />Both Jack and Rochelle came from educated and enlightened eastern European Jewish families.  As the two of them chronicle the onset of anti-Jewish depradations, they remind us of the rich texture of their pre-war lives.  This dimension of humanity, of lives complicated by strained love relations, competitive urges and the deeply felt need for independence, makes the Nazi onslaught all the more unsettling and horrific.  <br />Several themes predominate in the Sutins' braided lives.  First is the omnipresence of Jew hatred, whether it be in pre or post war Poland, in the brutally repressive Soviet bureaucracy or the finely honed hatred of Nazi Germany.  Indifferent neighbors, vicious anti-Jewish Russian partisans (who commit ghastly sexual offenses against women who want nothing more than to join them in battling a common enemy), and the active participants in human eradication, the Nazis, make the Sutins' world one of constant peril.  Survival is never taken for granted, and Jack and Rochelle's descriptions of their physical torment, often undertated, is wrenching to read.  Personal sacrifice exists on every level:  physical, social and spiritual.  Rochelle's first child dies within a daydue to exposure when its survival imperils others; Jack is literally covered with pus-filled boils as a result of living outside the boundaries of human habitation.<br />Yet, neither Jack or Rochelle never complain, never give themselves away to self-pity.  Instead, they are infused with the Judaic command to remember and Rochelle's mother's insistence on revenge, to take action to avenge the murder of their people.  In this charged atmosphere of sanguine justice and physical erosion, amidst the rank and fetid habitat of primitive partisan surroundings, hope and love survive.  Jack dreams that Rochelle will appear.  She does.  Despite sexual abuse and spiritual depletion, Rochelle gradually accepts and receives Jack's love.  He has never stopped loving her.<br />\\"Jack and Rochelle\\" is above all a cry of victory.  It is a cry that murder and eradication cannot conquer a people.  It is a cry that memory and consecration to life will prevail over death.  It is a cry that love can endure, even if it is formed in the absolute crucible of death.	2003-05-14

Its theme of self-discovery, a staple of coming-of-age novels, however has a distinct slant; \\"Allegra\\" insists that its protagonist, a precocious girl growing up in late Depression Brooklyn, hurl herself against familial and societal restraints imposed on her due to the simple reason of her sex.  Konecky has created a masterwork; her novel is neither strident or didactic.  Instead, her protagonist, Allegra Maud Goldman tells her own story  --  directly, ironically and courageously.  It is this unadorned, unaffected point of view and voice which enriches the novel and elevates it to mythical proportions.<br />Cursed with a memory which forbids her forgetting any sexist reduction of her self, Allegra's childhood unfolds as an unending conspiracy to eviscerate her unbridled enthusiasm for life and undermine her incredible intellectual talents.  Unsaddled from the urban poverty afflicting most Americans during the 1930s, Allegra lacks little material comfort but suffers, at an early age, from existential oblivion.  Her distant and chronically-absent mother, a social butterfly who has made peace with her marriage to a quietly tyrannical dress manufacturer, provides little to copy as a role model.  Allegra must set out to develop, define and fortify her own sense of self in a world seemingly set to reduce her to docile femininity.<br />In a revealing conversation with her mother, Allegra expresses discontent that her family focuses attention on her older brother David, who suffers from his own lack of confidence.  When she asks, \\"How come nobody around here is at all interested in whether I am finding myself?\\", her mother dismisses her by telling her that she will \\"grow up and marry some nice man and have children.\\"  Against this biology is destiny environment, Allegra launches her battle.  As her childhood evolves, Allegra challenges the different ways boys and girls are indoctrinated to handle their emotions, does battle with a public school system that diligently attempts to socialize girls into subordinate domestic.  Her sardonic friend Melanie has one of the best lines of the novel:  \\"If they're prepring us to be housewives...why don't they teach us something useful like sexual intercourse?\\" <br />By the time Allegra has come to grips with her evolving body, she has developed a passion for writing and a talent for poetry.  Her epiphany is hard-earned and promises a life of rebellion.  After having one of her poems purchased for publication in a daily newspaper, her father chooses to take her letter of acceptance instead of her creation to work as a means of validation.  Stunned and bewildered by how her family \\"managed, with nothing but good intentions, to make me feel so dismal,\\"  Allegra repeats her own mantra of self-validation, her own declaration of independence:  \\"You're a person.  You're a person.\\"<br />We tend to forget how hard girls have had to work to obtain what boys perceive is their birthright:  the need for self-definition, praise for ambition and affirmation for struggle.  Strong women come from strong girls.  Strong girls come from the crucible of their own experiences and the will to face the hurricane.  Edith Konecky's \\"Allegra Maud Goldman\\" will be a treasured companion for girls and women who savor the creation of an independent, autonomus self and will be valued by the boys and men who cherish  girls and women who are strong, vibrant and proud.	2003-05-11

Sadly, Melanie Smith's debut novel has all the flavor of recycled cardboard and the creative crackle of soggy cereal.  Cursed with a predictable plot, caricatured characters and cliched conflicts, \\"The School\\" limps along, begging readers to either put the novel, or themselves, out of misery.<br />Sumner presumably has much to criticize about the inch-deep devotion of Southern Baptists.  Their hypocrisy, obsession with surface adherence to religious dogma and patent stupidity all receive ham-handed treatment through the character of Florida Peppers, the wife of the dreadfully dull middle-manager Henry and self-pitying mother of asthmatic Roderick and discontented Louise.  In choppily sequential chapters, Florida struggles to give coherence to a family whose centrifugal forces far overwhelm her frustrated attempts to slather a Christian glue on her charges.  She fails, of course, but her attempts, rather than appearing comically doomed, demonstrate the author's unwillingness to provide anything else than slapstick.  There simply is not one instance where Florida appears human, merely confused and confounded by a world outstripping and overwhelming her Baptist unbringing and her devotion to the words of Jesus Christ.<br />Even more dreary is Sumner's depiction of the two men in the Peppers family.  Henry is deferential and silent at home, hidden behind the pages of his Wall Street Journal in the morning and content with his nearly pathological adherence to routine.  Roderick, sickly, insightful and withdrawn, never becomes anything other than a negative image from which his sister, Louise, develops.<br />In turn, Louise is unequivocally unbelievable.  On one hand, she is fat, and in desperation, her mother sends her to a Jewish psychologist who embodies every pernicious stereotype either a mental health worker or Jew could embody.  It comes as just a bit less than a surprise to discover that in the subsequent chapter Louise is a svelte sex kitten, just awaiting her immersion into the wonderful world of sex, which, of course, will happen after she bolts a charm-school girls' college for a flea-bag travelling circus.  By this time, only the most devoted reader will have any concern at all as to what will happen to the eternally sour Louise.<br />Preposterous, unbelievable and unimaginative, \\"The School of Beauty and Charm\\" may sell itself as a spritely addition to a growing body of literature by Southern women writers who satirically analzye their region.  Don't be deceived by the spin; this novel has all the beauty of pancake make-up and the charm of snakeoil salesmen.	2003-05-04

Berry then warns reviewers who &quot;explain, interpret...or analyze&quot; his work will face exile on a &quot;desert island in the company only of other explainers.&quot;  Faced with these restrictions and prohibitions, this reviewer will lavish praise on the author's sense of place, his gorgeous use of language and his admirable celebration of the American character.<br />Borrowing thematically from Mark Twain's &quot;Huckelberry Finn,&quot; &quot;Jayber Crow&quot; is a twentieth-century version of an American everyman's journey of understanding and self-acceptance.  Twice orphaned Jayber Crow never makes much money, never owns his own home, never marries.  Yet this gentle self-made spiritual giant who savors his life while trimming men's hair truly loves his Kentucky home of Port William.  Crow is a living embodiment of a Jeffersonian sensibility towards land; the protagonist extols the linkage between a respectful, near-reverential stewardship of the natural world and a sense of human fulfillment and grace.  Berry's Kentucky is not a cliched Arcadia.  Nature is often unpredicatable and tormenting.  What redeems and renews the relationship between humans and land is respect, modesty and connectedness, three qualities Jayber Crow exemplifies his entire life.<br />It is not an accident that the man Crow admires more than any other, Athey Keith, epitomizes man's symbiotic, custodial relationship with the living earth.  Nor is it accidental that the person who most tries Jayber's belief in the human condition, Troy Chatham, represents not only human cupidity, but alienation from and exploitation of the natural world.<br />Berry's physical descriptions of water, earth, plants, animals and climate are sensual delights, lushly detailed and enormously evocative.  Place mingles with the idea of home; the physical absorbs the spiritual; the specific event gains universal significance.  Because Berry imposes a modesty on Jayber Crow, readers discern a profound compassion for human frailties and a renewed faith in the imperative of connection.  The novel is at its best when Berry reveals our common needs and drives for attachment:  to our spiritual essence, to our brothers and sisters, and to our fragile, forgiving planet.<br />Echoing Serwood Anderson's &quot;Winesburg, Ohio,&quot; Berry's novel also selects a common man to serve as the unspoken but ackowledged subliminal repository of a town's secrets and identity.  Jayber Crow, unassuming barber, shares and shapes the identity of Port William, either through his ministrations to men's hair, as gravedigger or as church sweeper.  Regardless, the people of his community reveal themselves to him, and Crow perceives them as eminently human, flawed, incomplete and wonderful.  The author's ability to represent the masaic of our national character through the people who form the boundaries of Jayber Crow's life is simply extraordinary.  Nowhere is Berry's hopes for our national survival better manifested than through his depiction of Mattie Athey Chatham.  Under the author's skilled handling, Mattie evolves far past a love interest into a symbol of redemption and reconciliation.<br />Wendell Berry holds an esteemed position as an interpreter of who we are, what we believe and what we hope to represent.  &quot;Jayber Crow&quot; cements Berry's reputation as a celebrant of our democracy.	2003-04-28

Fowler bears the scars of a horrific childhood and early adulthood, one strewn with the wreckage of a shattered self-image fueled by the alcoholic abuse of her mother and the degradation of a hideous relationship with an older man.  She, as have many of her readers, has suffered through despair thick enough to reduce her to attempted suicide and has faced the depths of self-abdication so profound that she began to absorb the very evil identity her tormented partner imposed on her.<br />What makes Fowler different from us, however, is language.  In her hands, words make  anguish palpable, sadness tangible, struggle imperative.  As an author, Fowler is able to make sense of her life, and, in so doing, help us make sense of ours. \\"When Katie Wakes\\" may well be the most brutally coarse and ugly memoir you will ever read, but, at the same time, one of the most beautiful and impassioned pleas for individual integrity and indomitability ever composed.  It is nothing less than a masterpiece.<br />Though Ms. Fowler credits her adoption of a loyal and loving dog, Katie, as the symbolic act of reclamation and reaffirmation of life, she sells herself far short.  The grandchild and child of abused women, the child Fowler becomes the target of her drunken mother's rage.  The Fowler children become adept actors, hiding the shame of family disgrace and brutality under the veneer of achievement.  Keeping verbal assaults invisble, preventing others from recognizing the constant physical beatings absorbed by Mama, Connie's family life resembled \\"smoke and mirrors, deception and shame.\\"  A \\"wall of silence\\" shrouded suffering.  As a child, Connie received sustenance from words and books, and her resultant triumph as an adult vindicates her choice.  Her older sister, however, absorbs and internalizes the viciousness of her home, and, consequently, develops anorexia as an adult.<br/>In a remarkable self-portrait, Fowler describes a wretched adult woman, unloved, unlovable, disgusting and repulsive.  Her self-hatred is \\"untainted and unhinged.\\"  She believes herself \\"so ugly\\" that only an abusive, impotent, failed radio celebrity would be willing to love her.  Yet, there is not a single note of self-pity in this wrenching memoir.  Fowler reminds us that her mother's life, obliterated from a childhood rape, transcends her own in loss.  Mama was \\"an angry woman who believed life had let her down.  And it had.\\"  From disappointment to the target of her own husband's physical abuse, Fowler's mother recirculates and intensfies the pain, deliberately deflecting it on her children.  <br />As a young woman, Fowler has not escaped her mother's imprint.  Indeed, her chosen partner encapsulates her mother's jagged opinion.  Tense is irrelevant when Fowler hears herself described as \\"stupid,\\" or \\"an ungrateful whore,\\" or a \\"lousy excuse\\" of a lover or daughter.  When she hears her mother decry her existence, \\"I wish...I had died the day you were born,\\" Fowler must come to grips with an essential life choice:  descent into emotional self-immolation or ascent into a struggle for life and affirmation.<br />\\"When Katie Wakes\\" bravely portrays Fowler's battle for identity and wholeness.  Her steadfast determination to \\"take responsibility for my own happiness, for my own sense of self-worth\\" is the best medicine for any person struggling to make sense of inner turmoil and despair.  When she proclaims her need to discover \\"what my placer in the world should be,\\" she speaks for any person on the cusp of a life-altering decision searching for the courage to embrace life's potential.  This emotion-laden memoir is eloquent testimony to the ability of one person to wrestle life from death, hope from despair, the future from the past.	2003-04-13

Secrets, many of them swirling around sexual assault and compulsion, dominate the life of erstwhile Leighton Payne, the conscience-driven mayor and newspaper editor of Loring, a small town which steadfastly refuses to relinquish its past and defiantly adheres to racist principles.  Leighton grapples with his family's past, his wife's elusive affections and the sudden reappearance of his reprobate brother, Tandy, whose inability to hold a job is equalled only by his appetite for gambling, deceit and sexual satisfaction.  It is not an accident that Leighton uses a cockroach to \\"author\\" newspaper columns which admonish the community for its perverse commitments to ignorance, bigotry and hatred.  Nor is it an accident that the malevolent Tandy seizes a racist political opportunity to advance his own interests.<br />The central focus of \\"Visible Spirits\\" on the seething antagonism between Leighton and Tandy matches the novelist's perceptive inclusion of a series of fully-realized African-American charactes.  Loring's postmistress, Loda, proudly discharges her responsibilities, despite confronting the daily pressures of a culture determined to minimize her and the constant awareness of connection to the Payne family.  Her husband, Seaborn Jackson, a diligent insurance salesman, symbolizes not only the development of an African-American bourgeoisie, but the inherent fragility of social mobility in the South for any Black who dared tamper with the social rules of Jim Crow.  In turn, their lives quietly rotate around the quietly defiant Blueford, whose single act of rebellion ignites a firestorm of racist reprisal.<br />\\"Visible Spirit\\" gains its intellectual stature from the seemingly insoluble moral problems it dissects.  To what degree doesa son tolerate or repudiate his father's legacy?  How strong are the bonds of brotherhood, and what consequences result from blood ties?  What occurs to a man when he discovers he has never fully obtained his wife's affection?  What is the cost of racism, both on the victim and the victimizer?  What constitutes an act of heroism, an act of resistance, an act of love?  Yarbrough is nothing less than brilliant as he steps back from his own writing and permits his characters to wrestle not only with their own lives, but the vexing moral dilemmas they constantly encounter.<br />This talented, spare novel contains exceptional dialogue, vivid atmosphere, deft description of physical environments and absolutely believable characterization.  \\"Visible Spirit\\" is also subtle and multi-faceted.  It is a novel whose pace gradually accelerates and whose conclusion leaves the reader chastened but thankful.  Those concerned about the issues of racial justice and historical responsibility will welcome the addition of this novel to a national dialogue.	2003-04-10

More than any other occurence in my life, that single event informs me of who I am, what I represent and how I hope to live my life.  My bereavement has now lasted some forty years, and, at times, my grief is so freshly-minted it is as if Joe, my father, died just yesterday.  Despite the enormous love I held for him, despite the knowledge that he reciprocated that love, I am still in mourning.  As an adult and the father of two extraordinary sons myself, I yearn for a sense of peace, for a farewell to Joe, so that I may live the remainder of my life not suffused with the pain of loss.<br />A friend who has experienced torment over fatherloss encouraged me to read Neil Chethik's \\"Fatherloss.\\"  Knowing the depth of my despair, my friend sensed that reading \\"Fatherloss\\" could become a transforming experience.  It was.<br />\\"Fatherloss\\" is a detailed study of the impact of a father's death on sons.  It comforts, illuminates and instructs.  Chethik interweaves anecdotal responses of bereaved sons with his own life-affirming observations and commentaries.  His volume gently tears down walls of silence and suffering; it is not only profoundly moving, it is liberating in the understandings it presents to its readers.  As Chethik maps the differing responses of sons to father death through the variables of age, prior relationship and impact, he sheds light on the dilemmas and pain sons face as they attempt to mourn, assess loss and rejoin the living.<br />I now realize that I am far from alone in my reaction to my father's death.  Like many sons whose fathers' premature death shattered their lives, I never said goodbye to Joe.  Never told him how much I loved him.  Never gave him a final kiss.  Never thanked him.  And the resultant guilt and false sense of responsibility for his death caused my adolescence to be a period of unceasing loneliness and emotional isolation.  I disintegrated, despite the outward appearance of success and attainment.  <br />Chethik postulates that instead of words and tears (traditionally associated with female mourning practices), men often act.  We make or create legacies.  My headlong descent into a life of achievement and altruistic service, my feelings of never quite being able to live up to Joe's gigantic presence, my rejection of praise and any other compliment that would permit me to feel good about my life  --  all these behaviors, in Chethik's wise hands, make sense and fit into a larger mosaic of how men respond to loss.<br />Not every page of \\"Fatherloss\\" will be crucial to every reader; after all, it was difficult for me to identify with sons who had no relationship with their father or sixty-year-olds who had ample time to prepare for the demise of their father.  Thus, some passages of this volume may appear to border on the irrelevant to a number of readers.  Yet, \\"Fatherloss\\" provides solace, guidance and hope as nothing else I have read in my life has.  There are paragraphs in this remarkable volume which will graft themselves on sons' hearts, where their impact will engender a sense of hope, a sanctification of memory and a capacity to relinquish grief.  The sheer principled beauty of \\"Fatherloss\\" is its affirmation of life through the passageway of grief.	2003-04-06
US	50747195	R2VN5LBBSZE5VE	0345443128	690746719	A False Sense of Well Being (Ballantine Reader's Circle)	Books	5	4	6	N	Y	compelling view of woman's struggle with sterile marriage	Perhaps all one needs to know about the beauty and quiet brilliance of Jeanne Braselton's debut novel, \\"A False Sense of Well Being, is that Kaye Gibbons, a national treasure herself, joined Braselton unannounced and unsolicited during the author's inaugural promotional tour.  If Gibbons' resounding praise, that \\"this may be the best first novel\\" she has ever read is not convincing enough, perhaps the following will assist prospective readers to immediately purchase this compelling work.<br />Jessie Maddox, university educated and seemingly blessed with an industrious if not imaginative husband, has a serious problem.  Her marriage is unfulfilling, so sterile in fact, that she longs even for a false sense of well being to sustain her through her unhappy days.  Nursing a fantasy of her husband's death, Jessie suffers what many of us will recognize as truth:  good people can discover themselves in marriages which are dessicated emotional wildernesses, where passions have died, only to be replaced to repetitive routines which mask the terrors of personal loneliness and unrequited yearnings for excitement, happiness and completion.<br />Jeanne Braselton's brilliance is her capacity to mold such serious subject material into a quiet, generous and sensitive novel, one which possesses not only insights into the marital experience, but wry humor, quixotic characters and an ironic view of women's rebellion against loveless relationships.  For any couple who \\"spend their days moving around within the institution of marriage like the planets orbiting the sun,\\" Braselton's novel will read with the ring of truth.  When Jessie laments that her relationship with her husband has shrunk to the level of friendship and even that \\"was strained more often than not,\\" she speaks for any person whose prospects for happiness have shriveled.  Jessie sees her life \\"stretched out ahead  --  solitary, unchanging, and passionless,\\" and that prospect terrifies her.<br />Jessie hopes to find an answer to this intimately perplexing answer; the delight of the novel is the wacked-out characters from whom she tries to take solace and glean information.  Her sister Ellen, trapped in blue-collar hell, is a rebel who flaunts her sexuality to the chagrin of her perpetually forgiving mother and patient father.  Jessie's next door neighbor, Donna, solves her marital woes by satisfying her wants with a co-worker.  Donna's illicit affair appeals and repels Jessie.  By far the most satisfying secondary character is Wanda McNabb, who transcends the boundaries of patient-caseworker relationship when Jessie probes the actual reasons behind Wanda's murder of her husband after many years of marriage.<br />This amazing novel does not demonize men, does not pontificate about what is required for marriage to work, does not degrade its characters by requiring them to engage in predictable or stereotypical behaviors.  Instead, \\"A False Sense of Well Being\\" permits its readers to discover their own possibilities and responsibilities to create dynamic, loving relationships in marriage.  It takes real courage and true love of the human condition to write such a novel.  Jeanne Braselton has done just that.	2003-03-24
US	50747195	R1UQEQG5FKEG52	0142001740	378345448	The Secret Life of Bees	Books	3	13	17	N	Y	sweet, redemptive, but ultimately insubstantial debut novel	There is much to admire in Sue Monk Kidd's popular and heralded debut novel \\"The Secret Life of Bees.\\"  Rich in metaphor, triumphant in its portrait of women hewing out dignity in the midst of isolation and prejudice, the novel introduces us to Lily Owens, who possesses courage sufficient to discover the essence of motherhood.  She is a resolute, tormented and conflicted character, and Kidd's narrative provides Lily room enough to explore the dimensions of loss, love and redemptive memory.  Despite these considerable stengths, \\"Bees\\" sadly is a one-course meal, heavily flavored with honey but sadly lacking in depth, dimension and substance.<br />To Kidd's credit, she writes with nuanced voice and considerable insight.  Lily, whose life has pivoted around the traumatic death of her mother some ten years earlier, sets out to discover not only the mystery of her mother's death, but how she fits into a world devoid of love and family connection.  Lily learns the central lessons of life from a series of African-American women, all of whom seem to emanate the collective wisdom of the ages.  Her semi-articulate, mother-substitute caretaker, Rosaleen challenges a town's racists; her subsequent arrest and escape from jail frame Lily's odyssey.  Three beekeeping sisters absorb Lily and Rosaleen into their family; the matriarch, August, serves as the moral compass and pillar of strength to Lily, who absorbs not only lessons on tending bees, but the more crucial instructions as to what it means to be a woman.<br />Lily is at her best when grappling with the issues of loss.  Her father, T. Ray, crushed by the loss of his wife, steels his heart from his daughter.  Lily's lament:  \\"Let T. Ray love me.  Help me stop lying.  Make the world better,\\" is as wrenching as it is indicative of how deeply she longs for love.  Her supplication, \\"Take the meanness out of people's hearts,\\" is the central theme of the novel.  Her greatest discovery may be her recognition that memory, stories and continuity of family are the bedrock guarantees of personal coherence and the possibility of love.<br />Nevertheless, \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" will never be a memorable novel.  Lily's voice wavers between a believable fourteen-year-old and a sagacious adult whose vocabulary is only eclipsed by her introspective brilliance.  The African-American women teeter dangerously close to stereotypes.  Suspense is nearly impossible to sustain as Ms. Kidd never veers from what  becomes a sadly predictable conclusion.  Despite the noble intentions of its author, \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" becomes a hive without a queen, much buzz with insufficient resources to maintain the collective's life.d continuity of family are the bedrock guarantees of personal coherence and the possibility of love.<br />Nevertheless, \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" will never be a memorable novel.

US	50747195	RM2UN3IGL1YWG	0425184943	453088490	Blue Diary	Books	5	5	7	N	Y	sensuous and serious &quot;Blue Diary&quot; is a complete triumph	Alice Hoffman's &quot;Blue Diary&quot; is so extraordinarily brilliant, it is hard to know what aspect of this deeply human, gorgeously crafted novel is most deserving of praise.  Its narrative drive absorbs the reader, and its excruciating dramatic tension makes &quot;Diary&quot; a compulsive page-turner.  Ms. Hoffman's considerable understanding of the human heart in conflict with itself generates a series of tormented, bewildered and haunted characters, all of whom share a humanity that leaves one gasping with admiration at the author's compassion and love for the human condition.  The novel is thematically rich; existential questions vie with emotional quandries.  Hoffman investigates the very core of human nature in this novel, often with such subtlety that one mujst read sentences and paragraphs several times to appreciate the nuanced talent.  On top of all this, her imagery is lucious, sensual, provocative.<br />The plot of&quot;Blue Diary&quot; draws on the themes of change and transformation  -- within individuals, friendships, marriage and a community  --  when one man, a genuine stalwart in his small town discovers that his seemingly successful attempt to deny his past and recreate a new life unravels when he faces accusation of a particularly heinous crime perpetrated some fifteen years earlier.  The novel permits us to explore how much humans choose to remember, or forget, about their beloved's past.  To what degree do we owe commitments to take precedence above truth?  What occurs when love, trust, dedication, tolerance and honesty compete for our affirmation?  How do we really know what is real, whom to trust, where the limits of acceptance and repudiation lie?<br />Not only does Alice Hoffman fully integrate her complex themes in the tapestry of the narrative, each of her significant characters come to symbolize some transcendent idea.  Ethan Ford, at one a model husband/citizen and an accused murderer, personifies the author's investigation of the possibility and limits of self-creation and transformation.  Ethan's singularly perceptive and increasingly introspective wife Jorie compels us to question the very definition of love, fidelity and marriage.  Their bruised, conflicted son, Collie, and his marvelously-etched friend Kat discover new dimensions of frienship, and, inadvertently, betrayal.  Two seemingly mismatched characters, a  forlorn unhappy attorney and a despairing baker, burdened by the desolate emotional landscape of their respectively unfulfilled lives, ponder the possibilities of love and friendship as redemptive acts.<br />Hoffman's descriptive talents are fully on display in &quot;Diary.&quot;  She accords love such sensuous, lyrical qualities, readers may be tempted to call their own beloved and share passages.  She writes with such ardor that even cynics may be transformed into believers.  Hoffman is so skilled that she is able to make a backyard garden resemble Eden, the nighttime sounds of insects into a symphony.<br />&quot;Blue Diary&quot; will reconfirm Alice Hoffman's place in contemporary American literature.	2003-03-06

Simultaneously extolling the special beauty and transcendant character of the eastern Montana praires and blasting the subtle but pervasive sexism which limits the full development of Montana women, the memoir holds back no punches.  In lean, clean prose, Ms. Blunt explores the pivotal events of her life which eventually compelled her to break the mold of not only her own life, but the expectations of those whose impact on her life she sought to escape.  This memoir is at once liberating and harrowing, humorous and saddening, gentle and ferocious.<br />\\"Breaking Clean\\" attempts to extol the power of communal memory and shared experience by isolated women.  Blunt discovers that despite geographic separation, women's experiences \\"translate into the same feelings.\\"  Her own life's history encourages her to conclude that \\"what mattered most was the story, the truth of what we tell ourselves\\" and eventually pass down to subsequent generations of women.  The author never loses sight that while she lovingly describes the desolate beauty of a Montana praire and gracefully acknowledges its impact on the development of a unique personality, she does not permit geography to exert a deterministic power over her own self defintion.  In this sense, Blunt, from an early age, has declared war on restrictions which bound her from full development.<br />Nowhere is this more vividly described that her useless battle with her own physical maturation.  Outraged over her bodily changes occurring during puberty, Blunt tries to lance her own breast buds as a protest against anatomy's restrictions and social proscriptions due her lot as a woman.  She resolves to battle sexist barriers with a burning desire to become an equal among rancheers.  In an atmosphere where hard work and unsentimental vision are moral imperatives, where, as her grandfather proclaims, \\"This is no country for fools,\\" Blunt develops a premature understanding of women's subordinate place.  She winces at the scorn attached to the phrase:  \\"women's work\\"  and recoils at the idea that her mother is not accorded equal status despite her prowess inside and outside the home.<br />This rage against silent powerlessness follows Blunt as she undergoes her own personal transformation.  With descriptive language that borders on the lyrical and narrative detail that spares no-one, Blunt chronicles her life on a family ranch, the emerging independence she relishes as a high-school student living away from home, and her eventual entrapment in a sterile, repressive marriage.  Her anger never degenerates into self pity, her courage never wanders into hubris.<br />Though criticized for the inclusion of an event later discounted and repudiated, \\"Breaking Clean\\" is a vital and important memoir.  Absolutely American in its affirmation of rugged individualism, uncompromising in its advocacy of equality and proudly praising the soaring, mysterious attraction of the Montana praire, this memoir will elicit strong reader response.	2003-02-26
US	50747195	R1ERQFJEF4GXC1	0385336381	366460985	The Holocaust Kid	Books	4	6	8	N	Y	caustic "Kid" illuminates 2G anguish over Holocaust identity	Sonia Pilcer's important, provocative and caustic \\"The Holocaust Kid\\" defies easy categorization.  This novel is at once a profound contemplation of the Holocaust, a wickedly twisted view of the responsibilities and burdens of being a child of Holocaust survivors and a withering examination of the American Jewish sanctification of Holocaust memory and its attendant mandate of remembrance.  Told through the beleaguered, angry and sarcastic voice of Zosha Palovsky, \\"The Holocaust Kid\\" provides important insights into the lives of children of survivors, the 2G generation.  Zosha's emotional turmoil, her anger at being held hostage to a defining event she never experiences directly, but only derivatively, and her unflinching insistence on carving out her own identity give the novel its purchase.<br />The Holocaust looms as the defining nature of Zosha's life.  Her mother, the omnipresent and maddeningly oppressive Genia, and her father, laconic and intellectually inquisitive Heniek, provide their daughter with the foundation of Holocaust identity, which so informs Zosha's sensibility.  Forever aware of her responsibility as a replacement for so much that was lost, she laments relinquishing her own needs and wants.  She is warned that she \\"must never forget, not even for a moment.  Because I lived when so many died.\\"<br />Yet, what is she to remember?  Furtively cleaning her daughter's room, Genia discovers one of Zosha's essays.  Zosha examines the Hebrew injunction to remember, zachor.  Yet her daughter is confused as to what she is mandated to sanctify.  \\"Remember what?  Lives exitnguished?...Childhoods, entire countries and cultures lost?\\"  Zosha recoils at the unfairness of this obligation and the impossible enormity of its requirements.  Her father has \\"numbers,\\" her mother \\"nightmares;\\" Zosha is left with their \\"fierce, anxious love.\\"<br />\\"Kid\\" scrapes against our preconceptions of being a child of survivors.  When Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel proclaims that theiris a \\"privileged generation,\\" that 2G children are the \\"justification\\" of their parents' will to survive the unspeakable, Pilcer bitterly questions those assumptions.  If Zosha's life is so presumably sanctified by memory, why does remembrance bring discomfort and not peace?  <br />The daughter angrily denounces her parents' captivity by memory, their stubborn refusal to let loose and recreate a genuine new life in America.  Her parents memories served only to increase pain.  Their \\"tearful retelling of loss\\" reinforced their captivity to genocide.  Zosha bristles with anger at her parents' double standards, their inconsistencies, phony rituals and use of Judaism as a sword raised to compel obedience.  Even the Holocaust becomes but the ultimate parental means to subordinate Zosha.<br />Rejecting their wish that she become \\"normal, like Daddy and me,\\" Zosha sets sail to discover her own identity.  Though competently chronicled, this quest loses its tautness due to the structure of the novel.  \\"Kid\\" seems to be composed of disparate narrative episodes, and, indeed, many of the chapters have appeared in numerous journals during the past decade.  Though not every novel needs to appear seamless, \\"Kid\\" suffers from abrupt, disjointed changes in time.<br />This sole structural criticsm, however, should not dissuade readers from tackling this morbidly fascinating, intellectually provocative and psychologically revealing short novel.  \\"The Holocaust Kid\\" succeeds on levels which few authors have even attempted to explore.  It is an audacious, explosive and, in places, outrageous examination of the impact of the Holocaust on survivors and their children.  Its voice is new, fresh and memorable.	2003-02-23
US	50747195	RT36H6GT32K3W	0316096199	784206304	Lucky	Books	5	9	11	N	Y	courageous, resonant stirring memoir breaks silence on rape	Alice Sebold's ironically titled memoir, \\"Lucky,\\" is one of those rare and persuasive works of self-examination which plumbs a terrain few wish to explore:  rape.  Violently assaulted, sodomized and raped as a first-year student at Syracuse University, Sebold emerges as a woman able to summon extraordinary couage in the face of catastrophic violation and loss.  \\"Lucky\\" is powerful and precise, evocative and searing, instructive and redemptive.  Ultimately, it is a work which validates the author's immense struggle against victimhood and extols the need for voice and memory in the face of personal degradation.<br />Several recurrent themes appear, transform and reappear in \\"Lucky.\\"  Of primary importance is Sebold's insistence that despite the intervention (often bungled or unsuccessful) of police, family and friends, a rape victim essentially shoulders the responsibility for her own redemption.  \\"You save yourself or remain unsaved.\\"  A corollary emerges to complement this isolative requirement.  Rape victims inhabit a different physical and moral universe.<br />Rape is a watershed event, \\"a planet\\" in which an act of premeditated malice and violence places the victim on the other side of the chasm.  To those who are uninitiated, the pain is unfathomable and unknowable.  When Sebold's erudite, affect-limited father expresses an ignorant incredulity as to what he imagines to be his daughter's supposed non-resistance, she laments that if her own father doesn't understand, what hope is there that any man can.  Hers is an abyss created from fear, confusion, ignorance and denial.<br />A third theme vividly presents itself through the image of ruin.  When Sebold bitterly concedes, \\"No nice boy will ever want me,\\" she internalizes all the \\"horrible words used for rape; I was changed, bloodied, damaged goods, ruined.\\"  One of the quiet but profound virtues of this memoir is how the author slowly wrests dignity and strength from abject degradation and despair.<br />The finalthemes will resonate within any person who has been victimized.  They are the need to fight back, the thirst to gain control and autonomy of one's body and soul, and the want to ally oneself with loving, gentle, strong, understanding compatriots who will nurture a growing quest for justice and redress.  Sebold's ringing, eloquent insistence on breaking silence energizes her post-rape experience.  She learns that there is \\"power to be had in sharing my story.\\"  Bearing witness, pointing her finger at the perpetrator, giving voice to pure, seething rage permit Sebold to shed her weakness, isolation and self-blame.  Sepaking out and choosing to prosectute the rapist are acts of defiance, ownership and reclamation of sovereignty over her body, and, consequently, her spirit.<br />Aligned with voice are her radiant and inspirational professors who augment her sense of possibility and offer the solace and solidarity only a teacher can offer his/her students.  The poet Tess Gallagher is a true heroine, a genuine teacher, artist and friend.  Tobias Wolfe's gentle but firm invocation to \\"remember everything\\" affirms Sebold's assertion that \\"memory could save, that it has power, that often it is the only recourse of the powerless, the oppressed or the brutalized.\\"<br />This necessary and quintessentially inspirational memoir is suffused with pain, false dawns and recurrent tragedy.  Written in part with the detached precision of a journalist and the informed heart of a poet, \\"Lucky\\" compels our identification and respect.	2003-02-15
US	50747195	R322HS7J7SJXW4	0375760326	514859276	Junior's Leg: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	bawdy, engaging bayou reprobate reluctantly redeems himself	In his debut novel \\"Meely LaBauve,\\"  Ken Wells established himself as an affectionate and wryly observant chronicler of life in bayou Louisiana.  His sequel, \\"Junior's Leg\\" is nothing less than extraordinary.  Capturing the essence of this distinctive culture through language and razor-sharp characterization, Wells not only creates a larger-than-life protagonist, but infuses his story with genuine compassion, grief and wisdom.  His protagonist, a drunken, ill-educated, perpetually sexually aroused reprobate, Junior Guidry, grapples with issues of identity, purpose and love without even knowing it.  Junior easily captures the heart of his audience; his rough-hewn sense of humor, his abject acceptance of all the crud life seems to throw at him, his utter shock at discovering his heart  --  all his perilous, skewed attempts at understanding his predicaments reveal a bayou everyman.<br />Mr. Wells is wise enough to allow Junior to tell his own story in his own words, and Wells gracefully incorporates the patois of the spoken word, the incredibly rich idioms of the bayou, and the sharp, spicy tang that a storyteller utilizes to make events into fable.  On the surface, \\"Junior's Leg\\" is an incredibly funny story, but, just below, where the gators and snakes live, resides a serious commentary about dissolution, despair and despondency.  It is one of the delightful paradoxes of the novel that its protagonist, so thoroughly stupid and self-destructive, discovers the ability to redefine himself in spite of (or perhaps because of) alcoholism, lack of education and prejudice.<br />In this sense, \\"Junior's Leg\\" joins hands with the greatest coming-of-age novels of our national experience.  It doesn't matter that its protagonist has already reached, and long sense passed, the age of adulthood.  The wreckage of Junior's life, movingly recounted in his own words, becomes the prelude to the pivotal event of the novel:  his accidental encounter with an albino woman with a tattered, burdened past.  The confluence of her virtue with his vinegar, her hope with his despair, her confidence with his fatalism result in a powerful, compelling story.<br />\\"Junior's Leg\\" affirms all that is noble about our American character.  Its author, Ken Wells, writes with the best type of convictions:  that common people may instruct us to great truths, that language can delight and elevate, that ironic humor and wry laughter may well be the best antidotes to sadness and loneliness.	2003-02-07

Lofty goals, however, do not make a novel successful.  \\"Sleep\\" is eerily emotionless; its protagonist fails to elicit either sympathy or identification, and the author's style is alternately dense or elipitical. Though the novel deserves praise for its attempted illumination of the causation of facism's appeal in rural Austria, its narrative is sapped by excessive and unnecessary descriptive passages and vitiated by shallow characterizations.<br />\\"Sleep\\" focuses on the moral degradation and consequent alienation of its protagonist, Oskar Voxlauer.  Debased and scarred by his front-line experiences during World War I, Oskar emerges as a quintessential representative of blighted youth.  Shorn of frivolous idealism, Oskar nevertheless tries to reconcile his repressed hope for a coherent life with his silent resignation to the cruelty of the world and the absolute irrelevance of politics.  Indeed, Oskar's passivity and unwillingess to accept personal risk for ideas (even for defending one of his few friends, a Jewish tavern-keeper, from the facist onslaught) is part naturalist impotence, part stoic refusal to acknowledge pain and part selfish desire to lead an invisible life.  Regardless of Oskar's motivation to avoid direct confrontation with life, he disdains any political movement as unworthy of commitment.  After all, his own life's experiences, as a soldier for a purportedly noble cause, as a companion to a Ukranian woman under the iron grip of Bolshevik excesses or as a irrelevant gamekeeper to his Jewish friend's landholdings, have proven the worthlessness, even the danger, of adherence to ideas.<br />Unfortunately, the banality of evil as the cause of facism is not groundbreaking philosophy.  Wray's single greatest failure is to shed any new light on this perception.  The people who surround Oskar never receive adequate depth.  Even his Nazi adversary, Kurt, fails to arouse much disgust.  Ironically, Mr. Wray, in writing about disaffection, disillusion and lack of connection, composes his work in much the same vein.  If that weren't disappointment enought, his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, permits him to use an absolutely arcane method of dialogue, one which requires the reader to not only wonder who is speaking, but when and if the spoken word has begun or concluded.  The simple and proper usage of quotation marks would have made \\"Sleep\\" more comprehensible. Equally confusing is Wray's inexplicable replacement of Oskar's valuable first-person flashbacks mid-way through the novel with those of the Nazi Kurt.  What is a successful and thoughtful inclusion becomes an irrelevancy.<br />\\"The Right Hand of Sleep\\" proves that works about Nazism, Jew hatred, and the rise of facism are not easy compositions.  Despite the rich possibilities of dealing with the horrific loss of dignity and conscience of raw recruits in World War I, the novel never maintains dramatic tension or serious character development.  Consequently, this well-intentioned work falls far short of its hopes.	2003-01-27

The people who live in the pages of &quot;I Loved You All&quot; are fully-realized individuals, each of whom struggles with the anguish of either self-imposed or social isolation.  Even the setting, bleak, remote Stein, New York enhances the eccentricities and frustrations of the characters in this compelling, believable, and ultimately redemptive novel.<br />Told through the eyes of the endearingly hyperkinetic eight-year-old Penny Daigle, the novel gains its tension through the unspoken battle between her beleaguered but vibrant mother Marguerite and the eerily stoic Isabelle Flood, whose anti-abortion stance masks a life bereft of human connection.  Penny's sister Mahalia, compelled by circumstances and personal needs, reflects and intensifies the loneliness experienced by the two women who exert the most profound influence over her life:  her mother Marguerite and her caretaker/mentor/role model, Isabelle.<br />&quot;I Loved You All,&quot; however, is much more about character development than a plot that pivots around the struggle over abortion rights.  The four females who comprise the core of the novel's attention each face their own demons; each confronts a brutal loneliness and each develops the means to face her adversary.  Marguerite, though absent much of the novel, has enormous appeal.  While young, she sacrifices her adolesence so that she may care for her recently blinded brother, F.X.  Denied the opportunity of romance and free time, Marguerite is rescued by a loving marriage, which ends precipitously when her husband dies and leaves Marguerite the responsibility of raising two vastly different daughters.  A hell-raiser by nature, the grating endless restrictions of work, parenting and homemaking submerge Marguerite in a haze ofunfulfillment.  A transplanted Louisianan suffering through life in barren upstate New York, Marguerite staves off oblivion through drink.<br />Only the steadfast dedication of the two men who love her (her brother F.X. and her beau, David) convinces her to return to her home state to recover.  In her absence, her daughters take divergent paths to alleviate their sense of abandonment and isolation.  The oldest, Mahalia, obliterates her beauty and effaces her personality as she orbits more and more closely around Isabelle Flood.  Paula Sharp draws an exquisite picture of a teen-ager at odds with her family and her self as she presents Mahalia selecting involvement in a dessicated and stultifying &quot;right-to-life&quot; church instead of the unpredictable, but liberating, prospects of adolesence.  Mahalia's youngest sister, Penny, is literally hell on wheels.  Her unfettered enthusiasm for life and unquenchable thirst for knowledge and adventure thinly mask a child vulnerable to her own feelings of being unmoored, adrift amidst a family which is disintegrating.  For sheer, unadulterated energy and commitment to life, Penny is unparalleled; yet all her sound and fury pivot around her profound misery at being apart from her mother.<br />The novel's most enigmatic character, Isabelle Flood, suffers her own sequestered life.  Unwanted from childhood and untouched by love, Isabelle satisfies her need for connection through a ramrod dedication to the precepts of the anti-abortion movement.  Though capable of caring for Mahalia and Penny during Marguerite's absence but utterly unable to savor the messy possibilities of love, Isabelle is best seen not as a mouthpiece for a political movement, but the tragic residue of a culture which offers alienated and rejected adults little opportunity for a happy life.  She is at once honorable and detestable, idealistic and repressive, caring and insensitive.  Her contradictions give her a tragic believability.<br />In a revealing interview, Paula Sharp confesses, &quot;I can't imagine life without stories.  I think I would evaporate if I stopped writing.&quot;  Her briliant and absorbing &quot;I Loved You All&quot; endeavors to educate its audience about the most painful aspects of life:  how humans battle, often without the benefit of emotional roadmaps, to overcome loneliness.  That Ms. Sharp has done so though a novel which charts the tumultuous waters of the struggle for reproductive rights is all the more remarkable.	2003-01-19

Undoubtedly, the excessively repetitive and banal \\"Gone\\" will be hyped as a necessary self-help manual for bewildered, distraught parents.  The reality is that this overwritten lamentation features two signficant characters:  a screwed-up teenaged daughter and her equally screwed-up presumably adult mother.  Augusta is an execrable excuse of a child:  blithely ignoring the love, suggestions and admonitions of her mother, she smokes, drinks, does drugs, sneaks out at night and hangs out with whatever low-lifes exist in her bucolic Maine seaport town.  The scope of \\"Augusta, Gone\\" is what will become of this teen-aged mess and how her dippy mother survives repeated, but predictable, disappointment after disappointment.<br />The author is herself a textbook recipe of why certain people should not become parents.  As an indulged Jewish American Princess, Martha is suspended from her trendy prep school as a teenager and not permitted to attend graduation, to the consternation of her long-suffering mother.  Consistently breaking her own parents' hearts, she trips on acid, wanders around the nation and Europe (presumably in search of some purpose for her life), and settles into a marriage which dissolves shortly after producing two children.  Unable to find employment, Martha's mother does what any parent would; she provides her own daughter with a series of radio stations to own.  Thus, by the time Martha begins to realize that as an adult, she has some serious responsibilities to shoulder, she hasn't an inkling as to what the idea of moral responsibility means.  Is it any surprise that Martha's daugher becomes a living reincarnation of the mother?   <br />Augusta, in turn, is obnoxiously rebellious and unbelievably insensitive to the dynamics of her own family.  The daughter's self-absorbtion mirrors her mother's narrow selfishness; neither character elicits sympathy because both are out of orbit with the realities of modern American life.  Augusta is able to recycle misery on her family precisely because she knows that her mother has a limitless supply of \\"love.\\"  There simply is no motivation to change; why should there be?  Whenver Augusta returns from her infuriating escapades, Martha is right there to forgive and forget, if only her daughter would utter the magic words, \\"Mommy, I love you.\\"<br />Readers will wade through nearly two hundred fifty pages of teen-age abuse, self-piteous lamentations and family dysfuction to discover the memoir's two incredible epiphanies:  1)  raising children is really tough work and  2)  even after we love our children, they can break our hearts.  If your own experience has already taught you these esoteric lessons, \\"Augusta, Gone\\" will be exactly that  --  gone.	2003-01-02

Her protagonist, by the time she has graduated from college, has had to endure not only sexual trauma (brought on after a cruel seduction by her father's best friend) but a childhood shorn of family coherence.  Juliet has grown up in Santa Cruz, California, a haven for 1960s' flower children who seem to have no clue as to how to raise a child other than permit them to be \\"free.\\"  <br />Juliet's freedom includes calling her father Tom instead of Dad, suffering through a horrendous bout of hepatitis during high school, and being initiated into sex with a man old enough to be her father.  By the time she has graduated from college with a dual major of psychology and dance, Juliet's self-image, never strong, has withered.  San Francisco, with its promise of anonymity, provides a near-perfect backdrop for her descent into emotional numbness, physical degradation, and existential isolation.  First as a stripper and eventually as a self-employed prostitute, Juliet doesn't so much live as sleepwalk through life.  Her self worth erodes so terribly that she identifies with the ruins of the Loma Prieta earthquake:  \\"only things worth rebuilding were repaired.  Things that were too shaky to survive were either torn down or simply left alone.\\"<br />To fill the void of a life without any close human contact, Juliet selects degrading masochism.  Her job as a stripper brings her into contact with men whom she despises.  The men who ogle her lithe, seemingly child-like body, are \\"self-centered, style-obsessed, rich spoiled children.  I came to hate them...and I despised their divisive, computer-fixated culture.\\"  The customers would have \\"one hand on their persistently full, warm beer, and the other on their persistently full, warm crotch.\\"  Though Juliet begrudingly comes to assess the club dancers as \\"honest, clean, intelligent, friendly women,\\" she eventually abandons dance and descends into pornography and prostitution.<br />Lacking any model of social responsibility or interpersonal contact based on mutual respect or trust, Juliet thrashes about in an emotional wilderness.  Only catastrophy catapults her into the possibility of human redemption, through life in a secluded commune near her childhood home.  It is through the artistic integrity of her creator that Juliet's struggle for genuine self understanding and acceptance gains universal status.  Laura Denham's portrait of a young woman tortured by demons  --  some imposed by wrongdoers, others self-inflicted  --  is extraordinary in its emotional scope and inspiring glimpses into a personality fractured by life.<br />Ms. Denham's talents encompass much more than characterization and powerful narrative.  The author's imagery sparkles throughout the novel.  One character's eyes are \\"two polished dimes dotted in the middle with a single drop of Indian ink.  Aluminum with tiny holes cut into the center.  Littler sterling planets.  Mercury...a bad poet's day out.\\"  A purportedly healthy yogurt drink \\"tastes like something that might have dripped out from between my legs, only flavored with strawberries.\\"  Ms. Denham can flat-out write.<br />\\"Have You Seen Me?\\" is a slim novel with great impact.  Featuring a powerfully rendered protagonist, skilled dialogue and uncompromising glimpses of the seedier side of urban life, Laura Denham's first work is but a promise of an exciting literary career.	2002-12-30

On one level, Roth examines the devastating impact of a false accusation on an exemplary man's character; in this regard, \\"Stain\\" is little less than brilliant.  Serious and compassionate, angry and vituperative, despondent and triumphant, the novel traces the shattered remnants of the life of an intellectual whose existence disintegrated as the result of a malicious and spurious charge.  Professor Coleman Silk emerges as a fully developed protagonist, and his sufferings are genuine and wrenching.  Yet, Roth spends considerable time weighing in on other compelling issues of this era:  race, Vietnam, feminism, sexual expression and identity.  When the author treats these issues, \\"The Human Stain\\" reads less like a novel and more like a series of extended essays on the condition of American culture at the turn of the twenty-first century.  Therein lies the sole weakness of an otherwise essential, absorbing and necessary novel.<br />I can attest from the depthless sadness of my own heart that Roth's descriptions of what happens when a good man's reputation is trashed as a result of a patently bogus accusation is not only accurate, but unflinchingly profound.  When Roth asserts that \\"there is something fascinating about what moral suffering can do to someone who is in no obvious way a weak or feeble person,\\" he wisely acknowledges its \\"insidious\\" nature.  So profound is the sense of outrage, guilt, anger, frustration and spiritual isolation on the victim, \\"its raw realism is like nothing else.\\"  <br />As I know from personal experience, once an accusation sticks, the truthfulness of the charge becomes irrelevant.  Its stench and stigma invade and consume your life.  We'd like to believe that our friends and colleagues have learned the horrific lessons of McCarthyism; the reality is that victimizers and perpetrators have only refined the techniques of guiltby accusation.  Friends abandon you and link hands with foes in an alliance of expedience, indifference and feigned innocence and ignorance.  Silk is \\"humiliated and humbled and destroyed...over an issue everyone knew was [expletive deleted].\\"  Yearning for a voice of solidarity, hoping for a link with an ally, wishing for someone to take a stand with him  --  Silk instead is left \\"to nurse the crushing sense of abandonment that festered into the wound\\" that would come to absorb his life.<br />Philip Roth chooses, however, a more ambitious goal than a mere character study, and his novel suffers for that decision.  Roth sacrifices narrative drive for extended soliloquies; in some instances single paragraphs consume four pages of print.  Despite the enormous intellectual integrity and emotional impact of his novel, Roth's prose can leave the reader's eyes glazed with his seeminly interminable disquisitions on race, feminism, Vietnam or identity.  <br />\\"The Human Stain\\" is brutally painful, profoundly disquieting and intellectually challenging.  It is also frustratingly unfocused and excessive in verbiage and length.  Ignore the weaknesses of this novel.  It is one of the few novels I consider to be absolutely essential to undertand what we have become as a people.  Roth's chastening lessons will provide little comfort, but they must be heard and understood.	2002-12-28
US	50747195	R1UGWD4L9LUM4R	0345452771	723191315	The Yokota Officers Club: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	sensitive, multifaceted and compelling coming-of-age novel	&quot;The Yokota Officers Club&quot; is not only a convincing coming-of-age account of a daughter of a peripatetic military family; it is a sensitive and evocative exploration of the themes of family tension, hidden secrets and repressed fears.  Author Sarah Bird, drawing on her own life's experience as a &quot;military brat,&quot; has created a magnificent protagonist in the isolated and marginalized Bernadette &quot;Bernie&quot; Root, whose profound alienation from her life's circumstances compels her to discover the root souce of her quietly agonizing loneliness.  Written with genuine compassion and insight, the novel is a stunning success.<br />The Roots emerge as an archtypical military family.  Bernie's father, Mace, a heroic pilot whose storied career has been scythed by a decision beyond the comprehension of his family, is not only icily dictatorial at home; he is an emotionally stunted husband and father who issues orders and synchronizes and subordinates his wife and children to his floundering prospects for promotion.  Kit, Bernie's younger sister, is everything her older sister is not.  Gregarious, glamorous and charismatic, Kit adapts to the flux and transitory nature of the Roots' lives.  She stands in dramatic counterpoint to the silent suffering of Bernie, a reserved, introspective intellectual, who, seemingly by osmosis, aborbs the pain, frustration and bitterness exuded by her mother, Moe.  Not even called mother by her daughter, Moe is a strong, self-possessed woman whose decision to marry into a military life generates recriminations, unspoken bitterness and near manic combat with the restrictions of being the wife of an Air Force officer during the Cold War period of the 1950s and the escalating violence of Viet Nam in the 1960s.<br />Set in the pivotal year of 1968, the novel revolves around Bernie's willed exploration of her family's past, one which pivots around their extended stay at the Yokota Air Force Base in Japan during the 1950s.  There, the family's maid, Fumiko, becomes both a physical and psychological presence that somehow holds the secret to both the father's demise and the family's deterioration into emotional dysfunction.  Bird is nothing less than brilliant as she explores the layered relationships Fumiko has with Mace, Moe and Bernie and how those relationships catalyze the tumultous changes within the family.<br />Using the effective metaphor of smells, fascinating and complex characterization, and powerful use of selective memory, Sarah Bird's novel instructs as well as recounts.  Bernie's anguish, her isolated alienation and her deeply-felt sense of personal inferiority transform the plot into a serious analysis of troubling feelings most of us experience at the hands of our family.  To what degree do children assume responsibility for the sharp shards of parental discontent?  How do combative siblings resolve mutual animosity and mistrust?  Are silences and repressed secrets effective means of eliminating parental frustration and betrayal?  How much does a man owe his country, and to what extent does a wife owe her husband blind allegiance?  &quot;The Yokota Officers Club&quot; answers these profoundly vital questions with courage, insight and grace.  This memoir-like novel is little less than exceptional.	2002-12-15
US	50747195	R2UCGPOK2ZPGK2	0786886323	399419494	Carter Beats the Devil	Books	5	6	9	N	Y	no illusions or deception; "Carter" is a terrific novel	Combining riveting storytelling, engrossing characterization and exquisite descriptive writing, \\"Carter Beats the Devil\\" is an extraordinary novel.  Glen David Gold has transformed the life of Charles Carter, stage magician, into a compulsively readable account of one man's search for artistic and personal integrity.  On the surface, \\"Carter\\" reads as a melodramatic account of the struggles and successes of a dedicated, quiet magician; drawing on the magician's need for \\"misdirection,\\" Gold subtlely converts Carter's life into a symbolic representation of the American success quest, of decency combatting evil and of the possibilities of love overcoming existential loneliness.  It is a  tale of reconciliation of the impossible with the possible and the growing awareness that life's paths often intertwine the two without our being aware of which steps lead us in which direction.  There is magic on every page, the delightful demonstration of the performer's craft, to be sure, but also the stunning talent of a writer who assuredly holds his readers' attention in his hands.<br />\\"Carter\\" reminds one of \\"Ragtime\\" and \\"Dreamland;\\" historical figures have significant or cameo appearances.  Such luminaries as President Harding, Philo Farnsworth and Harry Houdini involve themselves in the intricacies of the action.  Gold also involves the Secret Service and introduces a particularly affecting agent, Jack Griffin, whose tortured conscience matches his selfless devotion to a public service whose highest-ranking officials reek with moral corruption.  Even the craft of stage magic receives scrutiny.  The villainous Mysterioso, whose tendency towards mendacity is matched only by his cynical vanity, also comes to represent any talented individual who has lost passion for the beauty of his/her abilities but manipulates those skills for personal gain.  \\"Carter\\" is an intensely moral novel, and no character better represents the quest for moral certainty than its protagonist, CharlesCarter.<br />The author's characterization of Charles Carter is at once both sympathetic and critical.  Gold's comprehensive research into Carter's life permits him to draw a character whose isolated childhood induced the study and practice of magic.  A  terrifying episode with the family's garderner provides the impetus for what becomes a life-long courtship with illusion, escape and misdirection.  Detached from his family's wealth but unsure of his own direction, Carter works his way from the bottom up as he sharpens his craft.  Assiduously respectful of the artistry of illusion, he develops a respect for the ethics of magic -- whose core tenets involve self-discipline, an honoring of the participants (including animals) in a show and a consuming desire to create original material.  Charles Carter is such a fully-developed character that it becomes easy to see how he would not fit into today's glitzy, self-absorbed culture.  Carter is simply too honorable, too self-deprecating to mesh with the \\"superstar\\" mentality of our current era.<br />In honoring the magician's admonishment that no details can be shared about the third act, this reviewer will abstain from details about Charles Carter's personal life, the inner and external conflicts he must wage in order to gain a sense of harmony on and off the state, and the implications that he may have been involved with the death of a President.  The colorful cover of \\"Carter Beats the Devil\\" should lure passersby to purchase this marvelous novel and enter a world where the impossible becomes the expected and illusion supplants reality.  Once you enter the domain of Charles Carter, you will surely be enthralled.	2002-12-03

Other novelists have used the backdrop of racism and wartime hysteria as a means of exploring the consequences of debilitating prejudice and the restorative hopes generated by love; Trobaugh, however, gives the theme a compelling wrinkle.  The setting is not the west coast, but a small, isolated Georgia community near the Atlantic Ocean.  The two protagonists are also far from typical.  Sophie, middle-aged and resigned to a loveless existence, has lived an emotionally-stunted life, accented by a repressive home and town whose adherence to racism symbolizes not only ignorance, but spiritual dysfunction.  Mr. Oto, an adult Nisei, bears his own shame and disgrace; disguising himself as a \\"Chinese gardener,\\" his only hope of human attachment revolves around a myth of a crane-wife.<br />\\"The Rising Sun\\" is at once slow-paced and emotionally compelling.  Trobaugh's command of language is impressive, and her evocative use of metaphor transforms both place and person.  Sophie's voice, for instance, \\"was soft and melodic, like the faint lapping of ripples at the edge of a beautiful marsh deep inside him.\\"  Decent people, struggling for a sense of authenticity during a period of racist hysteria, discover themselves in a well-intentioned but potentially disastrous lattice of lies.  Sophie's only friend in town, Miss Anne (whose voice assists in providing a subjective view of Sophie's experiences), quietly rebels against the prevalent, quiet evil of  Salty Creek.  Yet her resistance and friendship comes with costs; even Miss Anne must confront conscience against friendship, love against safety, pride against pragmatism.<br />As Sophie and Mr. Oto initiate a relationship which slowly, quietly and surely develops its own definition and dimension, they must wrestle not only with their own needs and hopes, but how those aspirations and desires enmesh their beloved in physical and emotional danger.  Trobaugh is nothing less than exceptional in her deft handling of quiet terror and spiritual isolation.  It is that central tension between love (and its attendant optimistic hope) and betrayal (of decency, of honor, of  interdependence) that gives this slender novel its enormous power.<br />\\"Sophie and the Rising Sun\\" is that kind of unassuming, subtle novel that reminds readers how and why the ability to love may be our most noble human achievement.  When it occurs amidst ignorance and prejudice, love is even a more impressive achievement.  Augusta Trobaugh, as surely as the symbolic crane which reappears mystically throghout her writing, interprets this terrain beautifully.  This novel is cause for celebration.	2002-11-15

Blessed with a down-home ability to tell stories and possessing a warmhearted view of the human condition,  Flagg, at her best,  combines humor and pathos to construct novels which educate us through laughter and tears.  Her most recent effort, \\"Standing in the Rainbow,\\" is a likable, kind and compassionate work, but it lacks both the power and integrity of her best work, \\"Fried Green Tomoatoes.\\"  Ultimately, reading \\"Rainbow\\" is much like trying to eat a five-pound box of chocolates.  What begins as a treat ends as a sugar-saturated burden.  <br />\\"Rainbow\\" is actually contains three distinct narratives, any one of which would have been subject material enough to carry the novel.  By chopping her novel into these distinct segments, Flagg diminishes the impact of the whole.  The best of the three is the fist two hundred pages; in it, we are transported back in time to the post World War II era.  Young Bobby Smith, whose mother Dorothy serves as the modest voice of midwestern maternal sensibility on her morning radio show,  explores life with a zest and innocence.  His beautifully drawn character shines, and Flagg expertly creates a  mid-century everychild whose hopes, frustrations and energy mirror the ebullient optimism of the period.  <br />Unforunately, when Bobby disappears from the novel, he is replaced by Hamm Sparks, an aspiring politican who is part Huey Long and Bill Clinton.  The middle section of \\"Rainbow\\" sadly reads as a dumbed-down \\"All the King's Men.\\"  Since the scope of \\"Rainbow\\" is a half-century, Flagg spends the final hundred pages whirling the reader through the last three decades of the twentieth century.  Although historical compression tidily moves the plot to its conclusion, the author unintentionally flattens the characters to whom she has so diligently given dimension the first two-thirds of her work.<br />Fannie Flagg can create memorable characters, and \\"Rainbow\\" has its storeof them.  Yet, unlike \\"Fried Green Tomatoes,\\" where her characters stood for something and faced challenges with humor, grace and strength, the men, women and children who populate Elmwood Springs, Missouri are never permitted the luxury to grow.  Instead, their appearances are episodic (just as is the novel), and lacking the time to develop, they eventually become predictable, even bordering on stereotypical.<br />This is not to say that \\"Standing in the Rainbow\\" should not be read.  Fannie Flagg is a national treasure, and some of her msot recent vignettes are absolute gems.  My disappointment stems from admiration; she is capable of far more emotional depth and character development than her most recent effort.  \\"Rainbow\\" reminds us of that the author is capable of much, much more.	2002-11-11

Its author, Loraine Despres, relying on her own upbringing in small-town Louisiana, seldom misses an opportunity for her protagonist, Sissy LeBlanc, to outrage the stultifyingly repressive atmosphere of Gentry, a community stewing in Southern heat and hypocrisy.  Sissy's journey toward self-realization leaves enough destruction in its wake to satisfy readers who savor strong women characters who confront their demons and find the courage to grab life when opportunity presents itself.<br />The Sissy LeBlanc readers first encounter is awash in a loveless marriage, silently suffocating while living with her truly egregious husband Peewee.  A proverbial long-lost love reappears and kindles passion and turmoil; through her relationship with Parker Davidson, Sissy emerges from a self-imposed exile from life.  Sissy's internal monologues, often peppered with numerous adages from a never-written but often quoted \\"Southern Belle's Handbook,\\" assist her in coming to grips with the need to make decisions and live by their consequences.  Living in the pre-feminist 1950s South, Sissy has precious few resources on which to depend as she fashions an imagined new life.<br />Despite the rich possibilities inherent in a novel which treats sexual repression and the impact of corrupt patriarchy, Loraine Despres comes close to, but does not achieve, the creation of fully-believable characters.  Several characters evolve stereotypically, becoming mere foils to Sissy LeBlanc.  Peewee, her husband, could have been given much more humanity.  Even though Despres allows us to feel sympathy for him as a result of his loutish father, Bourreee, Peewee never transcends his porcine-like presence in the novel.  Despres could have created a masterful work had she given her characters more, rather than less, humanity.  The author needs to realize that her protagonist could have prevailed over far more formidable foes than the unidimensional antagnoists who populate Gentry.<br />Equally grating are the excessive references to the aforementioned \\"Southern Belle's Handbook.\\"  While facilitating understanding of both the narrative of the novel and the development of Sissy's character when placed at the beginning of each chapter, Despres bogs down her writing when Sissy debates as to what number each rule was or should be.  What could have been a delightful addition to the novel has a tendency to be an annoying contrivance.<br />These complaints, however, truly do not interfere with the readers's enjoyment of \\"Scandalous Summer.\\"  Containing the gripping force of strong melodrama and featuring the tenacious struggle of a strong protagonist to realize her hopes for personal freedom and true love, the novel is not pretentious or predictable.  Loraine Despres' debut reveals an author who knows how to tell a story and entertain her audience.	2002-10-27

National and state governments, ignoring the realities of consumer demand for safe and effective contraception, have unsuccessfully attempted to repress not only the creation of birth control devices but have actively engaged in suppression of information about them.<br />Despite official opposition, a semi-covert, but vibrant underground market economy developed to satisfy the insatiable demand for methods to control sexual reproduction.  Professor Andrea Tone's meticulously researched and felicitously written \\"Devices and Desires\\" is at once a survey of the technology of contraception, a political analysis of the struggle for women to obtain control over the reproductive lives and an engaging social history of the advocates, producers and consumers of contraceptive devices over the past century and a half.<br />Recounted through a series of analytical and chronological narratives, Professor Tone provides an interesting perspective on Anthony Comstock, whose name now symbolizes sexual prudery and repression.  Tone comments that Comstock's fierce advocacy of governmental intervention and suppression of birth control contains its own class and ethnic bias.  Comstock purposely ignored the fact that his most loyal supporters not only abetted, but profited from, the production of birth control devices.  (Tone's exposure of Samuel Colgate's hypocrisy exemplifies this blatant double standard.)<br />Ironically, Comstock's purported success in nationalizing repression and supposed eradication the manufacture and dissemination of birth control products and information generated a robust, underground market-driven economy centered around contraceptive devices.  With large-scale industrial giants eschewing production, a fiercely competivite, unregulated industry blossomed and produced its own Horatio Alter success stories, such as that of condom-king Julius Schmid, once arrested and later lionized for the same activity.<br />\\"Devices\\" also praises the extraordinary contributions of Margaret Sanger but notes the costs of her focus.  Eventually losing her egalitarian radicalism, Sanger becomes responsible for the conversion of birth control from a market-generated phenomenon to a medically-controlled activity.  Though she succeeds in legitimzing contraception, Sanger inadvertently works to narrow the range of women who could obtain access to the very services and products she so deperately wanted to make acceessible to all women.<br />Tone's history contains numerous wise and unexpected observations about the political and social impact of the battle to make birth control legal.  Chapters detailing the controversial development of oral contraceptives and the re-emergence of the IUD help underscore the esential tensions of birth control in a nation where women consistently demand a safe-reliable product but their government sorely lags behaind clear public consensus.<br />This tension between technological ability and restricted social access to education and product results in our country's staggering rate of unwanted pregnancies.  Professor Tone's spirited history suggests that the history of contraception in the United States has many chapters yet to be written.	2002-10-26

Enger has described a world of faith, one in which an asthmatic child savors religious truth, tangible miracles and ironclad trust in a father whose love for his children is eclipsed only by his devotion to his God.  The characters who populate \\"Peace\\" become living symbols while at the same time gracefully engaging us in their physical, moral and spiritual struggles.<br />The physical environment of this bighearted novel is uninviting.  Wintry Minnesota and North Dakota provide appropriate physical challenges to the Land family, which must adapt to a crucial decision made by the oldest son Davy.  That decision, to pursue a violent, but just, resolution to two miscreants who terrorize the Land family, compels Davy to flee and the remnants of his family to pursue.  This quest, both temporal and spiritual, is the heart of the novel, and the author probes themes of family coherence, justice, truth, redemption, and faith with quiet, perfect timbre.<br />Enger is a magnificent writer, whose narrative abilities alone make \\"Peace\\" worth reading.  However, it is his characterization of the Land family which transforms his novel.  The narrator, Reuben Land, an eleven-year-old asthmatic boy, defines our perspective and never permits his adult recollections of the events of his childhood to interfere with an authentic, often painful, recounting of his participation in the central action of the novel, the discovery of his \\"outlaw\\" brother.  While Reuben discounts his own ability to understand and interpret events, he never underestimates the talents of his sister, Swede, who emereges as an enormously sympathetic young woman.  It is Swede's penchant for poetry, symbolism and subtelty that enriches our understanding of the enormous pressures and conflicts the children experience basking in the presence and shivering in the shadow of their father.<br />Much like the novel, Jeremiah Land has a \\"foundation...laid in prayer and sorrow.\\"  Through Swede's eyes, he emerges as either a full-blown Homeric hero or the living embodiment of a champion of justice of the Old West.  Readers will recognize his afflictions as similar to Job, and Jeremiah gains stature as he is seemingly purified by God's many painful tests of his faith.  From the onset of the novel, readers glimpse the impossible occurring through Jeremiah's intervention.  He literally breathes life into his newborn son; he survives a tornado; during prayer, he walks on air.  These miracles pale in comparison to the one he hopes to achieve with and through his family as they search for Davy.  A major triumph of the novel is Enger's unwillingness to permit his writing to become predicatable or saccharine.  Instead the bulk of the novel forces readers to either suspend their own disbelief  or submerge their own skepticism.<br />In a moving afterword, Leif Enger pays homage to his father, who \\"believes in vivid narration,\\" and his mother, \\"who writes better letters than anyone since the Apostle Paul.\\"  The author is a living representation of the values he extols in his parents.  \\"Peace like a River\\" deserves the widest audience.  Its unabashed belief in the integrity of the human spirit, its bighearted acceptance of the possibility of miracles and its loving evocation of family love and truth intermingle.  This is a novel worth reading, savoring and sharing.	2002-10-11
US	50747195	R2EHPX3SZ72UR2	0385720890	715933325	Sister Crazy	Books	3	2	4	N	Y	disjointed and disappointing stories are sadly disaffecting	Despite the considerable writing talents of Emma Richler, her debut collection of short stories, \\"Sister Crazy,\\" will leave readers strangely distanced from the family the author struggles so desperately to bring to life.  Her protagonist, Jemima (Jem) Weiss inhabits a family at once lovingly interconnected but simultaneously remote from one another.  Richler never determines which description most adequately represents the Weiss family, and, as a result, her writing wanders from sensitive appraisal to gushing sentimentality.  Although Jem provides the narration and perspective on her youth and somewhat surprising deteriorating adult life, she does so without much coherence.  Perhaps this is due to the anthologized nature of a short story collection.  In reality, the order of the stories cannot save this effort.<br />Richler tantalizes her readers with thematically rich questions.  What stresses exist on the middle daughter of a mixed marriage, one which combines parents of different religions and nationalities?  Is it possible to love one's family too much, and, if so, what stresses and strains result on the child once she attains adulthood?  Why would a secular Jewish father and urbane Protestant mother send sensitive children to a repressive Catholic private school?  Can adults find the internal strength and courage to confront a seemingly idyllic, eventless childhood to discover the roots of adult disaffection?  Unfortunately, Richler never extends her stories or her characters to provides serious answers, much less discussion, of these questions.<br />What remains is a series of short stories which orbit aimlessly around the themes of family life.  Other than the title short story, this anthology is eerily devoid of emotion.  Constant anecdotal vignettes about the idiosyncratic personalities of each member cannot subsitute for substantive development of chracter.  Excessive descriptions of matters esoteric, especially films, further sap energy from a volume desperate for emotional charge.<br />Practically every five pages, Emma Richler reminds us that her family literally shakes with \\"mirth.\\"  Unfortunetly, her readers will not do the same.	2002-09-27

In Professor David Blight's profoundly stirring history of Civil War memory, \\"Race and Reunion,\\" how and why the American people committed that event to their historical consciousness looms as significant as the event itself.  Professor Blight's study of the fifty-year period following the Civil War will leave those who yearn for racial justice deeply disappointed.  It is a cruel irony that deliberate forgetfulness of the past is a central theme of this powerful historical study.  For in our nation's purposeful historical amnesia and racist refashioning of the Civil War, a consensus \\"reconciliationist\\" view of that pivotal experience sowed the seeds of institutional racism and the deliberate obliteration of the very cause of the Civil War itself.  Blight's exhaustive research, presented in stirring, graceful prose, paints a dreary portrait of post-Civil War America; for all intents and purposes, the South may have lost the Civil War but it certainly won the battle in its unapologetic and energetic attempt to have the nation perceive history through the South's eyes.<br />Professor Blight describes an ongoing battle between two deeply different visions of Civil War memory.  The \\"emancipationist\\" vision absorbs the notion of the Civil War as a revolutionary event, one which not only abolishes slavery but begins the process by which African-Americans may become full and equal partners in a multi-racial society.  Emancipationists point to Lincoln's \\"Gettysburg Address\\" in their understanding of the centrality of slavery to the Civil War and its eradication as the most noble consequence of that war.  On the other hand, \\"reconciliationists\\" propose a vision that holds the South as the victim of the Civil War, Reconstruction as an unmitigated disaster and nobility of both Johnny Reb and Billy Yank as mutually heroic soldiers.  Completely absent in the \\"reconciliationist\\" view are African-Americans, other than as loyal, grateful slaves, willing to please their masters and hurt by any ill-guided attempts at freedom or equality.<br />Professor Blight is completely convincing in his arguments.  Even today, with many American communities celebrating \\"Civil War Days,\\" Americans feel more comfortable examining battles, proclaiming the mutual valor of both sides and celebrating reunion than examining our national racial past.  Emancipationists tend to make people feel uncomfortable; their idealistic commitments to justice and racial equality invariably place second to materialistic concerns.  In this sense, we in the early twenty-first century tend to unknowingly mirror Americans of one hundred years ago.<br />This fine history is not necessarily pessimistic.  Looming large is Frederick Douglass, whose passionate commitment to emancipationist views informs his entire public life.  He, more than any other character, seems to possess the vision and tenacity to hold steadfastly to the moral purposes of the Civil War.  His telling question, asked in 1875, rips to shreds the fatuous emptiness of reconciliationist views:  \\"If war among the whites brought peace and liberty to blacks, what will peace among the whites bring?\\"<br />The civil rights years, in which the nation was compelled to make read the promises of emancipation and the Civil  War Amendments, proves that any memory is central to a nation's self-image.  For nearly one hundred years, our country accepted as dogma the \\"Magnolia and Moonlight\\" theory of Soutern society; our national consciousness saw slavery as benign (even beneficent to African-Ameicans), our culture excoriated Reconstruction (how else can we explain the success of \\"Gone with the Wind\\" and its predecessor in racist ideology, \\"Birth of a Nation\\") and determined to honor both Northern and Southern soldiers as equally devoted and honorable.  Only in the past generation have Americans rediscovered the emancipationist vision and been compelled to use that memory as the yardstick to national policy.<br />Professor David Blight has written a vital and important history.  It deserves the largest audience.	2002-09-23

While reading Maud Casey's provocative, maddening and satiric debut novel, \\"The Shape of Things to Come,\\" readers may well find themselves realizing that the Beatles' Eleanor Rigby is reborn in literature.  Thirty-ish Isabelle, whose shambles of a life catapults her back to her frighteningly lifeless hometown, symbolizes the terrible hollowness and futility of modern suburban life.  Everythng Casey describes about Standardsville, Illinois, is designed to both mock and shock.  Casey knows how to blend morbid humor and genuine pathos; the very quality of Isabelle's existence is irritatingly pathetic.  Simultaneously, the protagonist repels and attracts as she struggles to find some kind of meaning to a life that is desperately hollow.<br />Even Isabelle's employment is pretense;  she acts as a mystery shopper whose duty is to discover hidden facts about movie theatres or trendy apartment complexes.  Donning disguises under the breathless encouragement of her temp-job supervisor, Isabelle has no more clue as to her ultimate destination as she does the personalities she half-heartedly adopts in her undercover \\"work.\\"  Presumably, work in America should be fulfilling, purposeful and productive.  In Standardsville, Isabelle's employment is sterile, duplicitous and pointless.  It is small wonder that she wanders through the novel as if stunned.<br />Her attempts at relationships fare no better.  Isabelle's mother Adeline is a modern-day dating machine.  Methodically working her way through every single man in the city, Adeline's existential hunger is never satisfied by male companionship.  So desperate is she for companionship that Adeline never stops to consider what human connection or intimacy is.  Rare mother-daughter conversations invariably return to the central theme of their lives:  an inexorable shabby loneliness. <br />The two men in Isabelle's life are a ying-yang of frustration, isolation and failure.  A renewed relationship with her former boyfriend, Duncan, bounces between attraction, rejection and misperception.  A lifelong sufferer of Standardsville, Duncan fights against his attraction to Isabelle, ultimately succumbing to his need to reignite the miniscule passion which existed between the two some twenty years previous.  Isabelle's bizarre neighbor, Raymond, deserves his own chapter in a college textbook on abnormal psychology.  His involvement with both Isabelle and Adeline provide insight into the quiet, disintegrative aspects of  suburban living.<br />Despite its satiric insights and vivid characterizations, Maud Casey's \\"The Shape of Things to Come\\" never gains traction.  It is as if the author could not make up her own mind as to the ultimate objective of her own work.  Biting criticism of suburbia  cannot permit much sympathy for a protagonist whose adult life reeks of aimlessness.  Yet Casey wants the reader to feel for and with Isabelle.  Any author who creates Mexican restaurants with names such as \\"En Queso Emergency\\" should not dabble in maudlin sentimentality.  That grating deficiency weakens an otherwise absorbing, energetic novel.	2002-09-14

This deeply affecting work treats the desperate sadness which innundates a family after experiencing traumatic loss.  All the more remarkable is the author's creative use of voice; her protagonist, Susie Salmon, narrates and analyzes events after her brutal death.  Through Sebold's magnificent descriptive writing, her exceptionally believable use of dialogue and her moving, sympathetic portrait of a family suffused with grief, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" becomes transcendent in its exploration of death, loss and recovery.<br />Riveting chracterization allows \\"Bones\\" to not only present a compelling story but to permit the reader an uncommon identification with the fascinating, evocative people who populate the novel.  The aforementioned Susie Salmon, whose corporeal life was extinguished as a result of a ghastly rape and murder, simultaneously oberserves and surreptitiously interacts with her family.  As she undertakes life in heaven, which is remarkably fluid and liberating, she also watches each member in her family absorb the terrible blow of her death.<br />How the Salmon family responds to Susie's death emerges as the single greatest achievement of \\"Bones.\\"  Losing a daughter or sister to an unexpected, violent death (and suffering the crushing indignity of never having her body found) shatters family coherence and induces a kaleidescopic series of responses.    Sebold writes with assurance as she elicits reader empathy with the stricken parents, Jack and Abigail.  Mother and father follow different paths as grief, anger and remorse overtake them; Sebold's description of marital stress and parental guilt are soaring examples of a writer who understands the complexities of the human heart.  Susie's siblings, Lindsey and Buckley, also experience the death of their sister distinctly.  Supporting characters advance the central themes of knowledge, responsibility and transcendence gracefully.<br />It is a rare thing for a writer to combine emotion and intellect as beautifully as does Alice Sebold in \\"The Lovely Bones.\\"  She entices us with a vision of heaven that challenges the \\"wings and harps\\" version; her heaven is dynamic, expansive and multifaceted.  Her treatment of the irrevocable sense of loss an unexpected death visits on a family soars; the emotional impact of this special novel resonates with sensitive truth.  With such compassionate, provocative and profound treatment of the theme of existential search for meaning after a safe, predictable life disappears, Alice Sebold's initial offering is thrilling evidence of a stirring voice in American literature.	2002-09-08

Never once stopping to worry about the level of acid in these wonderfully crafted stories about her Russian-Jewish immigrant family, Gallagher at one glorifies and criticizes the conflicts, expectations and ambitions her parents' generation manifest after having arrived in the promised land, the United States.<br />Gallagher rebels against her family's orthodox ideology, not of being Jewish, but of complete devotion to communism.  She notes that \\"a photograph of Lenin hung on the attic wall (I used to think it was my grandfather).\\"  Perpetually a disappointment to her cantankerous father and her sarcastic and manipulative mother, Gallagher fights to reconcile her \\"evidently selfish and frivolous nature\\" with her parents' zealous dedication to \\"the Struggle for a Better World [emphasis is the author's].\\"  Despite Gallagher's evident creative, discursive personality, nothing she can do measures up to her mother's morally rigid standards.  Thus, readers observe Gallagher as a disappointment to her parents and at odds with herself.<br />Not once does the author lapse into self-pity.  Instead, her chaotic, sarcasm-laden life becomes grist for a vocation which at least sounds respectable, that of being a writer.  Her account of her evolution as a writer is the highlight of the memoir.  She rubs shoulders with such luminaries as Bruce Jay Friedman and Mario Puzo while pounding out bilge for pulp magazines.  As she hones her skills, she dismisses her later books with a self-deprecatory wave.  Her willingness to mock her own self-presumed failures  --  as a daughter, as a wife, as a worker  --  makes one wonder how much of her parents' lack of approbation she absorbed during her childhood.<br />Dorothy Gallagher would dismiss sympathy for her life as misplaced sentiment.  Instead, she writesher memoir with enough tartness to make any reader's mouth pucker.  Her relatives are rough-and-tumble greenhorns who may or may not make peace with their new land.  Foibles, failures and faults flow throughout this slender, wry memoir.  As to her inheritance, Dorothy Gallager permits the reader to discern what wealth truly exists in her family.	2002-08-31
US	50747195	R2ZHH1L6TPV8CH	044023722X	299088859	A Painted House	Books	5	1	1	N	N	bittersweet, evocative account of a tumultuous boyhood	After savoring John Grisham's \\"A Painted House,\\" it is easy to understand why this talented author has such a devoted national following.  Sensitive, provocative and sweetly sad, \\"A Painted House\\" perfectly evokes time, place and character; the narrative is utterly captivating as it encourages the reader to not only identify with the people who live in the novel's pages but to perceive life in rural 1952 Arkansas as if we are sharing the lives of the Chandler family.  Grisham's abundant talents as a storyteller are evident in this sympathetic recounting of Luke Chandler's seventh year of life, but the reader can savor even more the deft, subtle introduction of serious themes throughout the novel.<br />Black Oak, Arkansas, 1952, becomes of microcosm of impoverished rural America on the cusp of modernization.  Isolated by geography and culture, the three generations of Chandler men, Eli, Jesse and young Luke, have been wed to subsistence cotton farming.  Tenuously holding on to survival, the Chandlers depend on cotton; their lives are tethered to the land and are subjected to the vagaries of weather, the market and the availability of seasonal labor to harvest their precious crop.  Against this backdrop of family and regional pride, the Chandlers encounter circumstances which compel them to examine their attitudes, behaviors and expectations.  \\"A Painted House\\" movingly presents the shattering events of Luke's seventh year with uncommon skill and grace.<br />The youthful Luke absorbs experiences and confidences which at once confirm and challenge his previously-held perception of his world.  Events compel secrets; secrets reveal knowledge, and knowledge begets  obligations.  How does Luke respond to newfound responsibilities?  In what manner will he balance the need for quiet and the surging urge for shared knowledge?  Is it possible to reconcile the divergent pressures for family coherence, economic survival and ethical behavior?  What exactly is the right thing to do when confronted with wrong?  All of a sudden, life becomes much more than fantasizing about his beloved St. Louis Cardinals, and heroic performance is transmuted from Stan Musial's exploits to real actions by family members and fellow workers.<br />The sheer wonder of the narrative, however, is eclipsed, in my judgment, by the majesty in which John Grisham treats the numerous serious themes aswirl in his work.  Previously isolated rural America is in the process of modernization, and the attendant stresses and dislocations (from war to the vagaries of economic markets) receive serious attention.  Racial antipathies, blended skillfully with class antagonisms and regional prejudices, not only advance the plot but compel Luke to consider moral behaviors in a markedly modern cast.  Human sexual behavior, from childbirth to romance, entices and confuses Luke; his reluctant, but exciting, knowledge of the adult world of family life, romantic love and human sexuality is one of the best aspects of the novel.  Grisham also deftly treats natural disaster, casual violence and familial power relations with uncommon sensitivity.<br />\\"A Painted House\\" is that kind of book that yearns to be shared.  A celebration of voice, the novel rings with authenticity.  Its vibrant chracters have real struggles; its conflicts yield no easy solutions; its optimism is genuine and deeply affecting.  Blending Mark Twain's capacity to tell a good story while instructing the readers as to matters of the heart and John Steinbeck's abiding love for and trust in the decency of working men and women, John Grisham's novel will endure as a treasure.	2002-08-30

Unlike &quot;Climate,&quot; which deals with social oppression, &quot;Island&quot; treats the most intimate and personal of circumstances:  an adult daughter called to comfort a mother stricken with inoperable cancer.  <br />As if that were not torment enough, the adult daughter, Sara Ellis, introspectively relives her troubled childhood, and those recollections and memories trigger anger, guilt and betrayal.  The brilliance of this absorbing, painful and absolutely believable novel lies in the interplay between Sara and her mother Reba  --  between the past and present, between pain and possibility.<br />&quot;My Mother's Island&quot; flows between a twin series of cross-cutting vignettes, one which treats Sara's witnessing and attempting to mnediate they symptoms of her mother's cancer, while the other series focuses on the childhood traumas Sara experienced.  Now an expatriate living in Puerto Rico, Sara's mother Reba unknowingly triggers a warring set of emotions in her daughter.  We observe Sara weaving between compassion and icy anger, between the conflicting needs of a child yearning for a parent's acceptance and an adult child striving for authentic independence.  Mueller provides no easy answers to the profound questions Sara ponders; indeed, it is the compressed and frightening nature of her visit that forces Sara to relive a lifetime of emotional turmoil.  The author provides an impressive resolution to this profound quandry.<br />Marnie Mueller not only skillfully dissects the themes of terminal illness, personal transcendence and  interpresonal conflict, she does so with a set of characters who provoke our identification and sympathy.  The two protagonists, Sara and Reba, are an emotional dichotomy.  Both must confront identical issues of anger, disappointment, betrayal and rejection.  How the two become alive to one another while answering their own private questions is another exceptionally strong aspect of the writing.  The community which surrounds Sara and Reba in Puerto Rico is lovingly etched; Sara's compaion Lydia is especially impressive.<br />Readers should not anticipate a &quot;feel-good&quot; novel when approaching &quot;My Mother's Island.&quot;  This raw, painful and moving work is a testament to the impact of realistic writing and the power of two strong chracters squeezing truth from pain and undersanding from hurt.  Marnie Mueller, whose own life itself reflects a deep respect for political idealism, has much to teach us.  Her redemptive novel is inspiring, compelling and necessary.	2002-08-29

The only solace in Haven Kimmel's \\"The Solace of Leaving Early\\" is exactly that:  leave early.  This incredibly bad novel is dense and turgid; her protagonists are so grating  and stilted that they'd make native Indiana residents embarrassed to claim residence in the Hoosier state.  Lost amidst ponderous theological, philosophical or existential ruminations is a plot so predictable that many readers will abandon the novel halfway through and not miss a thing.<br />\\"The Solace of Leaving Early\\" will appeal, however, to a select group of people.  If you enjoy pretentious, arcane and esoteric allusions to literature and theology, Kimmel's writing will thrill you.  It will come as no surprise to discover that the author majored in English and attended seminary; her novel literally advertises her erudition.  For those readers who savor sexually-frustrated female protagonists who sequester themselves in a suffocating attic in the middle of summer as an act of self-isolation or flagellation while pretending to write the great American novel, Langston Braverman will fulfill every fantasy.  Readers who prefer the quietly isolated and oh-so observant-yet-tormented man of God, Reverend Townsend's sophomoric pronouncements and anguished ambivalence over the direction of his life will satisfy your tastes.  Devotees of extraordinary, inexplicable religious phenomena will thrill at the appearance of the Virgin Mary in a tree trunk, discovered by two sisters whose parents perished in a macabre domestic dispute.<br />Haven Kimmel proved in her memoir that she possesses compassion, humor and insight.  Her soaring account of the joys, possibilities and hidden delights of small-town Indiana life reveals an author who surely has an informed heart.  Her debut novel is simply astonishing in its divergence from her talent.  As a memoirist, Kimmel honors language; she is nuanced, honest and understandable.  As a novelist, she is pedantic, pretentious and unintelligible.  The people who populate \\"Zippy\\" are genuine; even their flaws make them lovable.  The characters in \\"Solace\\" are as endearing as fingernails being scratched down a chalkboard; to a person they are predicatble and strangely disaffecting.  Haven Kimmel should have abandoned \\"The Solace of Leaving Early\\" quietly and unobtrusively in her own attic.	2002-08-15

This duality gives his account of his mother's life and his own evolution from a bewildered refugee child into an accomplished American a poignancy and power.  \\"Displaced Persons\\"  will stand as an important contribution, not only to our understanding of the long-term implications of being a survivor of the Holocaust, but of the unique burdens, pressures and responsibilities children of survivors inherit from their parents.<br />Berger is acutely aware of \\"the unmentioned sorrow that was the subtext to everything [his] parents said or did.\\"  Haunted by memories, devastated by enormous loss, handicapped by their arrival in America in their twenties and driven to provide security for their families, Holocaust survivors often perceive their children as replacements of beloved family members who perished and as repositories of hopes and dreams denied them.  Worried about their children's safety, happiness and future, Berger muses about his parents' perspective, \\"What could I say about the dread and suspicion with which they encountered a world that had proven maliciously fickle?\\"<br />As the author emerges from childhood, he begins to chafe from his mother's protective, controlling instincts and desires to assert himself as his own man.  Berger's wrenching analysis of his status becomes the overarching theme of his memoir.  \\"I  saw myself now an an American...I would no more be the timid refugee boy with one leg planted in the fearful shtetls of Poland, with a mother ever vigilant that no more perils come to the remnants of her kin.\\"  It is this unspoken loving tension between Joseph and his mother, Rachel, that gives \\"Persons\\" its dynamism.<br />Alternating between two narratives, one his own and the other the gripping account of his mother's survival, Berger deftly intermingles past and present.  Aware of his distinct heritage, the young Berger recognizes others in his impoverished Manhattan neighborhood who share his background.  \\"We knew one another, knew in our young bellies that our parents were the same dazed and damaged lot, had the same refugee awkwardness, the same whiff about them of marrow bones and carp.\\"  Now attempting to wrest coherence in America, Holocaust survivors tend to frustrate Berger with their problem solving techniques.  Berger prefers the American way of standing up directly; survivors \\"were always scraping by on a willingness to do what was necessary to survive, even if that meant surrendering pride or principle.\\"<br />Raw emotion floods \\"Displaced Persons.\\"  Rachel's symbolic mourning of a dead child in Warsaw at the onset of World War II serves to remind us that she has no \\"mental picture\\" of the actual murder of her family.  Unspoken grief undulates throughout the memoir.  Berger's stoic father Marcus scarcely articulates his unfathomable sense of loss; nearly half a century passes before he can utter the names of his sisters.  Guilt ebbs and flows in Rachel's description of her survival.  Anguished over refusing to bring non-kosher food to her hungry brother during World War II, she has never forgiven heself, calling it \\"the worst thing I ever did in my life.\\"<br />Yet life surges and humor emerges in Berger's descriptions of growing up in New York City in the 1950s and 60s.  With both parents working at dreary, tiring jobs, the author experiences a freedom of movement he admits he would never conceive of allowing his own daughter today.  His descriptions of his initial exploration of Manhattan reveal the sheer joy of discovery, the incredible exuberance of youthful hopes and the awesome sense of possibilities Berger recognizes in his new home.  Berger's frantic disposal of an illicit girlie magazine carries universal appeal; he becomes an American everyboy.  His struggles with self-confidence,academic competition and sexual frustrations are those of not only his generation, but of those before and after.<br />Written with conviction and compassion, \\"Displaced Persons\\" is that kind of memoir that not only describes, but instructs.  Through the author's descriptions of his resolute, stubborn and proud mother, survivors attain an identity beyond that of suffering and loss.  His own life's story shapes our understanding of the purpose of our national experience and the sacredness of an American identity.  Treating both the Holocuast in its past brutality and its implications for the second-generation children of survivors, the memoir blends sorrow and joy, heartache and hope, pain and redemption.academic competition and sexual frustrations are those of not only his generation, but of those before and after.<br />Written with conviction and compassion, \\"Displaced Persons\\" is that kind of memoir that not only describes, but instructs.

Yet, her protagonist Georgia Jackson sputters and drowns in a series of boring, predictable and practically irrelevant interrelated short stories that presumably trace her journey into selfhood admidst a quintessentially screwed-up family.<br />Perhaps others can perceive the artistry and coherence in Sellers' stories.  Not one episode rings true; contrived events compete with unidiminsional, unbelievable characters.  Georgia Jackson, whose anguish over and fascination with her body, obligingly obsessess over every flaw in her self-proclaimed woefully inadequate physical being.  Long, supple legs cannot compensate for her \\"flat as a board\\" chest.  Flirtatious but unbelievably naive about sexuality, the body-conscious Georgia untimately emerges (surprise, surprise) as a beguiling sex goddess so hot that her pathetic mother wishes to spray her down, as one would a dog in heat that parades in one's front yard.<br />Not only must Georgia wrestle with her sadly disappointing physical self, but she must cope with parents who would be better cast in a Looney Tunes feature.  Her reprobate father, who is, among other things, a braggart, a drunk and a pervert, somehow still manages to tug on his daughter's heartstrings.  Georgia would serve herself better had she listened to her realistic, well-grounded brother Sid (who, sadly, simply disappears as a character).  Sid correctly labels their father as a useless jerk.  Georgia's mother, who doesn't even receive a name until the penultimate story, is even more surreal.  Mousy, angry, disgruntled, Mary Caroline never figures out that a restraining order just might be a plausible solution to control her over-the-top husband.  <br />Lacking plausible characterization and a coherent plot, \\"Georgia under Water\\" simply does not make much sense.  Even taken individually, each of Heather Sellers' short stories fails in their quest to illuminate a teen-ager's turbulent odyssey towards authenticity.  Presumably Heather Sellers understands the dynamics of her characters and the purpose of her work; she surely does not convey her message to her audience.	2002-08-09
US	50747195	RC73T22XZHOT7	0452283221	87463839	A Perfect Arrangement	Books	3	10	15	N	Y	a real yawner:  lifestyles of the rich and clueless	Suzanne Berne's second novel, \\"A Perfect Arrangement,\\" is ample testimony that wealthy, well-educated and upwardly mobile people can be terribly stupid about family life and the cruel ways of the world.  Their utter cluelessness about parenting and their alarming propensity to self-absorbtion make Mirella and Howard Cook-Goldman as unaffecting and sympathy-repelling a pair of protagonists you'd hope to meet in a novel which purportedly examines the modern American family under stress.  Awash in self-pity (oh, but there isn't enough time in the day to do all the things I need/want/desire to do) and exposed to the consequences of downright dumb decisions, the Cook-Goldmans compel the reader to utter, \\"You deserve this misery, you foolish idiots.\\"<br />Berne's novel, set in an ancient, trendy and  much-sought-after small coastal town an hour from Boston, will appeal to a select audience of east coast rich yuppies who want it all (and I mean right now) and are astonishingly blindsided when their reality doesn't match their dreams.  For the rest of us who live in the real world, \\"A Perfect Arrangement\\" runs dangerously close to being irrelevant and certainly fails to connect with the lives most of us live.  <br />Millions of American families survive far greater traumas than those of the Cook-Goldmans.  In the real world, parents with children who suffer developmental disabilities would move to a location where services are available to improve the lot of their child's life.  Pearl, the bratty, insolent five-year-old daughter, tyrannizes her family and makes her lawyer mother and architect father appear as the village fools in their half-baked attempt to provide some semblance of discipline to her life.  In the real United States of America, embattled couples manage to fight their way through marital deceits, disappointments and despondencies.  Husbands and wives learn to make sacrifices for their children and accept the human and existential limits of each other.  Realpeople find ways not to spend their days wringing their hands over their own flaws, and they certainly lack the funds to subsidize a full-time nanny.<br />If you can look past these flaws, \\"A Perfect Arrangement\\" features wonderful writing, a strong narrative and a compelling conclusion.  Suzanne Berne proved in her first novel, \\"A Crime in the Neighborhood,\\" that she is quite capable of dissecting the contemporary American family, and her second novel surely mines the same rich vein.  While her debut novel had depth and never approached stereotyping, \\"A Perfect Arrangment\\" sinks under the weight of weak secondary characters and near melodramatic conflicts.  Readers who take cultural analysis seriously and expect novelists to do the same cannot help but be disappointed with \\"A Perfect Arrangement.\\"	2002-07-27
US	50747195	RG43K4FL2AFTU	0156007177	993626301	The Aerialist	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	quirky, off-kilter aerialist captures spotlight	At first blush, Richard Schmitt's debut novel, \\"The Aerialist,\\" would not appear to be a vehicle for investigating the elusive nature of the American Dream and our national obsession with work.  Its protagonist, Gary Ruden, admits to \\"an overwhelming urge to avoid responsibility and work at any cost.\\"  Travelling circuses, the novel's setting, usually invite sarcastic commentaries about the low-lifes who make their lives and livings there.  Ambivalent about his family's midwestern roots and disgusted with his New England father's second wife, the nihilistic Gary seems right at home in an America unravelling from the momentous and disruptive social changes of the late 1960s.  Initially desiring nothing more than to disappear, Gary adopts the circus as his home and, beguiled by the incredible work ethic necessary to be an aerialist, comes to represent, in his own chaotic, bewildered and uncertain fashion, the American Dream.<br />Through the deft writing of Richard Schmitt, Gary Ruden emerges as a quintessential American, and \\"The Aerialist\\" evolves as an off-beat, sardonic evaluation of the American obsession with success.  Gary Ruden exemplifies the underbelly of the American Dream; at the onset of the novel, he lives only for himself, willing even to abandon a cancer-stricken best friend for his own advancement.  Unwilling to concede the existence of a tomorrow, Gary decides to travel with a circus, allowing a predetermined itinerary to dictate the pace of his life.  A drive to achieve stealthily sneaks up on the protagonist, gradually consuming and directing his life.  Soon enough, Gary Ruden is incredibly goal oriented and dismissive of those who are not.<br />Gary's lessons are hard learned, and the costs he pays for that understanding are high.  \\"It's the things you don't know about yourself that become the most valuable once revealed.\\"  The novel's greatest strengths revolve around Gary's growing sense of self, which, in turn, centers around his drive to become a stellar performer.  His physical, mental and emotional devotion to practice and to perfect his craft mirror our national dedication to excellence.  Success has its steep price, and Gary discovers the perils of attempting to juggle relationships, friendships and self-control while devoting himself to his goal.<br />\\"The Aerialist\\" has other virtues as well.  The novel features numerous fascinating vignettes about the men and women who compose circus life, and Richard Schmitt's eye for detail and ear for dialogue are exceptional.  Schmitt's introduction of Gary's grandparents provides an important familial context through which Gary's decisions are formalized.  Yet, the novel contains several weaknesses as well.  Schmitt never permits the reader to become too close to Gary, and this psychological distance inhibits a complete identification with the protagonist.  Nor does Schmitt permit the reader an adequate sense of closure with the conclusion of the work.<br />On the whole, however, \\"The Aerialist\\" is a gem.  Transforming one of life's losers into a metaphor for the American Dream is no small achievement.  Ricahrd Schmitt writes with uncommon assurance and brings enormous insights into the life of a travelling circus.  His characters warmly embrace life, are unfraid of their chosen life-style and aggressively pursue their private dreams.  It is this sense of turning things upside down, of finding the nugget of truth in a life that would otherwise be ignored, that gives \\"The Aerialist\\" its power.	2002-07-22
US	50747195	R2LVMSQ9RRYWD4	1559705493	237879551	The Inventory	Books	4	1	1	N	N	evocative, unsettling, but choppy exploration of Holocaust	One of the challenges facing novelists who use the Holocaust as a central theme of their fiction is finding focus and thematic coherence.  As the deliberate, horrific destruction of European Jewry during  World War II fades in historical immediacy, that catastrophic event tends to be blended with other human-made disasters of the past.  This dilution of the Holocaust's profound destruction results in a faceless quality to genocide; it becomes just another mass murder of the blood-drenched twentieth century.  Gila Lustiger deserves praise for her determined attempt to put a human face on inhuman mass murder in her engaging, evocative but frustrating \\"The Inventory.\\"  At its best, Lustiger's novel is a brilliant kaleidescopic work of art; it is multifaceted, psychologically challenging and desperately perceptive.  At its weakest, \\"The Inventory\\" reads like a shattered mosaic; one senses the art behind the writing but is unable to discern direction and meaning. <br />\\"The Inventory\\" is neither a character study or a narrative-driven novel.  Instead, the very core of this work is the Holocaust itself; the event itself looms as the thematic thread which ties together over thirty otherwise disjointed short stories.  Victims, perpetrators and bystanders have names, faces and their own histories, but no one character dominates.  Instead, Lustiger assembles an extraordinary cast, from working-class Germans to wealthy Jews, whose sole purpose is to illuminate how and why this genocidal murder could take place.  The author's answers unearth no new discoveries, but her conclusions are at once irrefutable and distressing.  Mass murder occurred because most Germans either hoped it would or did not care if it would come to pass.  Nazi dictatorship, as brutal and comprehensive as a police state could become, accomodated (and did not create) Jew hatred in Germany.  Betrayal, denunciations and removal afforded economic opportunities; moral behaviors, including compassion and defiance, atrophied.  That Lustiger could accomplish her examination of the Holocaust through a collection of broadly interrelated short stories is a considerable literary achievement.<br />Yet, other writers have tackled this approach to the Holocaust with better results.  For instance, Marcie Hershman's \\"Tales of the Master Race\\" reads with more coherence and equal power.  Nevertheless, Gila Lustiger's novel has moments of absolute brilliance.  Her account of a German divorce proceeding, which resulted from \\"the purchase of a silver-plated powder compact from a Jewish store as a marital offense,\\" demonstrates the degree to which Jew-hatred had saturated German society in the late 1930s.  The evocative story of Ernst Fuchs humanizes the despair, degradation and self-doubt victims encountered during the decade of deliberate anti-Jewish laws and actions.  Her concluding short stories clearly are written in the crucible of anguish and sorrow.<br />Despite its disjointed, fractured format, \\"The Inventory\\" is a successful novel.  Gila Lustiger set out to place faces on those who betrayed, removed and murdered Europe's Jews.  Her novel does much more than that.  With graceful, even poetic language, \\"The Inventory\\" invites the reader to grapple with his or her own questions and dares the reader to challenge the notion that this genocide was perpetrated by bureaucratic indifference and cold-blooded, inhuman murderers.	2002-07-15
US	50747195	R2DGCR6OYTE7KM	188259357X	468696426	Worthy's Town: A Novel	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Rolens' "Worthy's Town" nicely parallels "Winesburg, Ohio"	Nearly a century ago, Sherwood Anderson shattered literary tradition with his iconoclastic portrait of small-town America in the throes of modernization.  His \\"Winesburg, Ohio\\" dealt with themes traditionally associated with sophisticated urbanites:  alienation, emotional isolation, loosened sexual restraints, emotional displacement and social corruption.  Sharon Rolens' intriguing, enticing and immensely readable \\"Worthy's Town\\" deserves favorable comparison with Anderson's masterpiece.  Whereas Anderson interjected philosophical considerations through his alter-ego, George Willard, Rolens permits her narrative to provoke thought; her protagonist, Cappy Gilberson, evolves within a social milieu which simultaneously restricts and liberates his growing intellectual independence.  Both Anderson and Rolens, however, focus attention on a town, and the town becomes the focus of the novel, its characters advancing the evolution of the social organism.<br />Cappy Gilberson, raised by his maternal grandmother and grandfather, comes of age in the Great Depression.  His world reflects the verities of middle-American rural existence; death can be both sudden and cruel.  His own mother, Chastity, dies after unsanitary handling by the local midwife.  His grandfather,  Worthy, believes in the power of the spoken word and the salubrious impact of storytelling.  Cappy's natural intelligence and inquisitive nature absorb this willingness to exaggerate fact to prove a point; he becomes a brightly reluctant student whose own search for his father becomes a painful part of his childhood.<br />Rolens introduces a variety of characters, all of whom advance the reader's growing awareness of the social structure of Old Kane, Illinois.  Expressions of sexuality, from childhood experimentation to storefront braggaodocio, from cruel ostracism of presumed homosexuals to downright nasty innuendo, receive candid treatment.  Rolens is at her best when Cappy needs to expand his own horizons; his dogged detemination to demonstrate independence finds resistance in his grandfather, his teacher and his newspaper editor.  He learns of the fragility of friendships, of the enormous impact of sexual appetite and of the imperfect mechanisms of dispensing justice in an otherwise indifferent world.<br />Since \\"Worthy's Town\\" has such a relaxed, conversational style, it may be easy to dismiss this novel as light reading.  Yet, Sharon Rolens has encompassed genuine emotion, human growth and terrible hurt in this piercing work.  Without our being aware, Old Kane, Illinois gradually evolves as a microcosm of a changing nation, interpreted through the eyes of a once-innocent, now maturing protagonist.  In this sense, Ms. Rolens advances the literary insight initiated well before her own birth.  Sherwood Anderson would heartily approve of \\"Worthy's Town.\\"	2002-07-10

White's compelling \\"A Dream of Wolves\\" is much more than an intriguing murder mystery.  Written with a deft hand, the novel features an extraordinary protagonist, a middle-aged gynecologist wracked by guilt over his son's death and riddled with a sense of social and personal responsibility for not only his professional obligations but his personal life as well.  Doctor Stuart Jordan not only finds himself embroiled in a troublesome homicide, he also attempts to resolve the terrible internal conflicts which have rendered his life quietly unbearable.  Not only does the author surround Doc Jordan with a series of beautifully-realized characters, Michael White imbues his narrative with precise, evocative detail, from medical terminology to lush descriptions of the North Carolina Appalachians.  This is a work which doesn't just transcend the boundaries of the mystery potboiler, it recreates them.<br />It is the quality of conscience and devotion to truth, both external and internal, which defines Doc Jordan.  The premature, accidental death of his son some fifteen years previous has destroyed his marriage and left Jordan adrift in his own life.  Guilty over an intemperate utterance at the time of his son's disappearance, Jordan futilely observes his marriage disintegrate; his wife's life dissolves in a haze of bipolar destructive behaviors.  Unable to sever his relationship with Annabel while simultaneously initiating an invigorating but furtive relationship with an assistant district attorney, Doc Joran always seems subservient to his internalized sense of responsibility.  Despite Annabel's deteriorating emotional state, Doc assumes responsibility for her status; on the basis of his word and an uncanny instinctive feel for an accused Cherokee woman, he assumes responsibility for the care of the accused's newborn child.  He serves as a quiet Northern conscience in an isoalted, rural Southern town, always putting others ahead of himself, perpetually reminding himself of what he needs to do for others.<br />This keen psychological study of a tormented man, a good man thrust in a whirlwind of pain, guilt, recrimination and remore, is the cornerstone of \\"A Dream of Wolves.\\"  How Doc Jordan comes to grips with his personal circumstances, tenaciously serves justice in his quest for the truth of a grisly homicide and begins the wonderful process of personal regeneration, through his love for his custodial child and his passion for the love interest in his life are the separate threads Michael White adroitly interweaves in this immensely readable novel.	2002-07-06

This brilliant work ultimately is about possibilities:  of living in a world drenched with blood, of overcoming enormous personal fears, of embracing one another's past to insure the chance of mutual survival.<br />Each of the three central characters has a unique voice (so much so that this latticed work includes three different type settings) and presents his or her own complicated confrontation with silence and memory.  Each character gropes for meaning; each confronts the terror of the past, the anguish of living a solitary life and the desperate fear of abandonment, great sadness and existential isolation.  Each character learns the nobility of bearing witness. <br />Julian Perel has absorbed the silence and imagined Holocaust memory of his father, Jacob.  Living upstairs from his musically-gifted sister, Julian is an obsessive recluse, immersed in a life of suffocating detail, terrified of human touch, suspicious of language and voice.  He theorizes that his father \\"gave up his language because it belonged to the killers; he could not live with the sounds of their voices inside his own.\\"  Like his now deceased father, Julian speaks in \\"the vocabulary of  science and never reveal[s] his heart.\\"  Tormented by a past which he does not fully comprehend but which dominates his personality, Julian's self-imposed isolation is at once a private  punishment and a social rebuke.  It is only through his halting relationship with Sola, a hired housekeeper, that he begins the process of personal integration.<br />Hired by Paula Perel to oversee her downstairs apartment while pereforming in Europe's opera houses, Sola expands her domestic obligations as she initiates a friendship, a relationship, with the reluctant Julian.  Sola, ravaged by memories of her village's annihilation at the hands of a brutal Latin American despotism, has her own torment, unshared and terribly burdensome.  Slowly, quietly, Sola and Julian begin to learn a central lesson:  sharing memories and making others become derivative witnesses to social evil is a good thing.  By permitting this \\"buried language\\" to surface, Sola initiates a process by which both Julian and she perceive the possibilities of life.<br />The most tragic figure in \\"Speed\\" is Paula Perel, whose operatic voice soars through her apartment and vibrates with immediate beauty.  Seemingly oblivious to post-Holocaust trauma, Paula sets out to Europe to test the quality of her voice.  There she discovers the hidden story of her family's past with shattering consequences.  Where Julian has had a lifetime to absorb memory and silence, Paula has but days.  She learns that inflicted silence \\"bruises the heart,\\" that her father's heart must have been \\"completely black and blue from a lifetime of sorless grief banging around in his chest.\\"  How Paula confronts both her own personal crisis and the implications of the Holocaust on her professional life is one of the many instructive moments of the novel.  <br />\\"The Speed of Light\\" is nothing less than brilliant.  Invoking the Hasidic teaching that \\"there are three ways to mourn:  through tears, through silence, and by turning sorrow into song,\\" Elizabeth Rosner has crafted a moving novel about love and meaning and connection in the midst of remembered pain and sorrow.  Through her sensitiveportrayal of three fully-imagined protagonists, Rosner teaches us that people can emerge from the wilderness of despair to the refreshing oasis of possibility, voice and connection.	2002-06-29
US	50747195	R3VYPWZ8YKGY26	1566634113	808276386	A Legend in the Making: The New York Yankees in 1939	Books	3	6	8	N	Y	good, hardly great, treatment of pinstripe pride and prowess	Richard Tofel's capable treatment of the dominant 1939 New York Yankees is much like reading a solid sports column about the previous day's game.  &quot;A Legend in the Making&quot; is factual, interesting and engaging, but it is also unmemorable, cliche-ridden and intolerably nonanalytical.  Although Tofel writes with a crisp style and salts his observations with vital facts and otherwise esoteric information, &quot;Legend&quot; fails to pesuade the reader as to why this particular Yankee club was the progenitor to the idea of dynastic domination of the sport.  <br />In certain respects, Tofel set an impossible task for himself.  At the onset, the reader knows that the Yankees dominated the American League in 1939, the pennant race being over, seemingly, by mid-July; the club swept Cincinnati in the World Series.  By winning its fourth consecutive World Series, the Yankees achieved a height no other club had reached.  Tofel cannot create any tension or anticipation in his description of the season; his drawn-out account of the World Series lacks drama.  Since the reader already knows the outcome of both the season and the Series, Tofel must present an argument as to why this particular club deserves a book-length treatment.  In this respect, &quot;Legend&quot; is simply not successful.<br />The 1939 Yankees were very much an &quot;ensemble&quot; ballclub.  Aside from the emergence of Joe DiMaggio as the centerpiece of the team, the Yankees featured strong performances from players whom they had cultivated from their farm system.  Tofel tantalizes us with useful data about the successful performances of '39 Yankees who emerged from the system but fails to discuss how and why the Yankee farm system emerged as superior to the other clubs in the American League.  Nor does Tofel spend any significant time comparing the '39 Yankees with the storied '27 Yanks.  If the '39 Yankee team is &quot;legendary,&quot; why is its most signifcant and enduring memory Lou Gehrig:  hisconsecutive-streak ending, his diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and his wrenching &quot;Luckiest Man Alive&quot; speech?  Given manager Joe McCarthy's pivotal presence in the dugout does Tofel spend no time comparing his strategies (driving his players mercilessly, insisting on absolute perfection, playing his hunches with his pitching staff) with those of other American League managers?  Tofel himself admits that many of the players on that fine team had &quot;czreer years;&quot; that admission alone weakens his argument that this particular club was legendary.<br />&quot;A Legend in the Making&quot; is not without its strengths however.  Tofel is superb in shedding light on the McCarthy-Gehrig confrontation over the Iron Horse's consecutive game streak; his description of Gehrig's physical and emotional state during the July 4th tribute is profoundly moving.  The author's research sheds light on the terrible care players received when hurt; that the '39 Yankees performed so brilliantly with so many of its key players nursing debilitating inujries attests to the resolve of the players.  Joe McCarthy's contribtions to the success of this team are capably described; to a generation of young boys who have no idea what it means to &quot;dress like a Yankee,&quot; Tofel's admiration of the skipper is refreshing.  Perceptive biographical sketches abound and truly serve as the backbone of the book.<br />Despite these strengths, &quot;A Legend in the Making&quot; does not deliver in the clutch.  Avoiding responsibility for analyzing, for truly explaining his central thesis, Richard Tofel instead writes exactly as he describes himself, &quot;a fan who finds himself back in 1939.&quot;  The men who wore the pinstripes and those of us who love the national sport deserve better than that.	2002-06-18

Professor Jan Gross' concise and convincing monograph, \\"Neighbors,\\" marshalls direct historical evidence and a creative historiography to  prove \\"beyond reasonable doubt, and as Jedwabne citizens knew all along, it was their [Polish] neighbors who killed them.\\"  Gross, with excruciating detail, dissects the July 10, 1941, murder of practically every Jewish man, woman and child in that small Polish city.  What makes Gross' research important is that this slaughter was not Nazi-inspired, but initiated, orchestrated and celebrated by Poles themselves.  This direct indictment of Polish involvement (not mere complicity or helpless bystanding) shatters a half-century of Polish myth-making about that nation's alleged victimhood during World War II.  <br />Professor Gross does not sensationalize the actual murder itself.  A day-long orgy of violence, which was at once primitive and comprehensive, featured the climax of burning alive those Jews who had not perished in the mayhem of the day.  In fact, not only did the non-Jewish Poles of Jedwabne participate; participants from other nearby Polish communities, themselves veterans of other pogroms, journeyed to Jedwabne to commit depredations on the Jewish population.  Instead, Gross focuses on the impact this research may have on Polish national identity.  In this sense, Gross simultaneously adds to and departs from standard interpretations of the Holocaust.<br />His research is the least creative in his reaffirmation of the now widely-accepted thesis that those involved in the destruction of European Jewry did so volitionally.  Jedwabne's murderers are \\"willing executioners\\" in the purest sense of the word.  \\"Everybody who was in town on this day and in possession of a sense of sight, smell or hearing either participated in or witnessed the tormented deaths of the Jews of Jedwabne.\\"  Yet \\"Neighbors\\" will not leave its mark on Holocaust historiography as a mere reaffirmation of the Browning/Goldhagen thesis of uncoerced genocide.  Professor Gross' monography deserves praise for the questions it poses and the new directions it stakes out.<br />More important is Gross' investigation of how thoroughly Jew hatred has saturated Polish society and how that vicious prejudice found outlet through the Nazi policy of annihilation.  His research disabuses theorists who propound a \\"modernist\\" interpretation of the Holocaust.  His analysis of the Jedwabne massacre asks for a \\"heterogeneous\\" interpretation of the event; one which acknoledges that many participants acted with the most primitive of instruments, without bureaucracy to direct their efforts and from a myriad of purposes and motivations.  He challenges future historians to accept and cherish the accounts of survivors instead of treating them with skepticism.  \\"The greater the catastrophe the fewer the survivors.  We must be capable of listening to lonely voices reaching us from the abyss.\\"<br />Finally, Professor Gross may make his greatest contribution to the future of a genuinely free Poland with his invocation to an inclusive history of Poland's involvement in the destruction of its own population, its own Jews, during World War II.  Eschewing collective responsibility, Professor Gross nonetheless warns Poles of the danger of ignoring this extraordinary event in its past.  To ignore involvement in mass murder vitiates future claims to moral coherence.  It is this call to conscience that makes the terse \\"Neighbors\\" a critical additition to Holocaust historiography.	2002-06-16

Harper has written a most unusual gem of a novel, one which treats the brutally depressing theme of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's with grace, insight and humor.  Not only does \\"The Worst Day of My Life, So Far\\" feature a completely believable protagonist; the novel compels the engaged reader to consider its corollary themes of failed marriage, frustrated parenting, ethical decision-making and existential despair.  Harper pulls no punches in her narrative, recounted by the ironically anguished/bemused/furious voice of lonely, bewildered and angry Jeanne Buchanan Roth. <br />The author deliberately introduces a high level of discomfort in her work and refuses to back down from requiring her audience to confront the multiple nightmares of caring for a parent whose ability to function is permanently reduced by mental deterioration.  Jeanne's deep ambivalence, emotional isolation and individual lack of fulfillment provoke the reader's sympathy.  Jeanne's character, tormented by self-doubt and misgivings as to her decisions, maintains its dynamism through her internal monologues and compels our emotional linkage with her by virtue of her onerous circumstances.<br />Jeanne Roth can't have a life any worse than the one she is living.  The child of a glamorous, distant mother who literally devotes her life to enshrining her annointed husband, C. Ray, Jeanne spends her youth living in the shadow of an idealized marriage.  Unloved and unsure of herself, Jeanne never develops an internal strength necessary for mature adult life.  Riddled with questions of her own worth, she vaults into an ill-considered marriage which, not surprisingly, flounders and fails.  Her mother's certainties about wifely devotion and motherhood stand as symbolic rebukes and repudiations of Jeanne's attempts at family life.  Chilled by her own coldness, Jeanne cannot connect with her husband or her son.  Never confident about her appearance (a worry encourged by her mother's incessant belittling of Jeanne) and adrift in a life that yearns to escape her suffocating Louisiana roots, Jeanne is reluctantly convinced to return home to care for her mother, Velma, in order to honor her father's last wishes.<br />\\"Worst Day\\" chronicles Jeanne's homecoming and her seemingly-endless obligations to the deteriorating Velma.  \\"I've never had much of a life, and that's pretty much my own fault.  I didn't know how to make things work [with my husband]. I've never known how to really connect [with my son].  I don't know exactly just what I have to show for my life.  And now, it's over. Dead and buried in Auletta, Louisiana, Official Rectum of The Western World.\\"  Yet, there is not a drop of self-pity or self-absorbtion in this gutty novel.  Instead, M. A. Harper elects to require the reader to confront every mixed message or panic over a botched decsion we may have experienced ourselves.  This invitation to introspection bnds us in an alliance with Jeanne and her turmoil over her life.  By so doing, her fears and ambivalences become our own.	2002-06-15

Written with uncommon elegance and extraordinary sensitivity, Winik explores the final weeks of the Civil War  --  days fraught with military violence, widespread despair and panic, a horrifying assassination and uncommon magnanimity  --  and deftly provides a thoughtful analysis of the significance of those momentous events.  In addition to presenting a compelling thesis, Winik also provides a gripping narrative to the military and political events of the Civil War, numerous illuminating biographies of pivotal historical characters and convincing cross-cultural comparisons which support his essential argument.<br />Winik augments the now widely-accepted notion that the Civil War was our first truly revolutionary war with the hypothesis that the central historical figures of the late Civil War period, by virtue of political acumen and personal integrity, understood that if the United States were to exist as a country, it would have to cohere as a nation.  The United States faced \\"the most significant question of all...how to reunite two separate political, social and cultural entities that had been bitter military enemies...\\"  Professor Winik's thesis is that \\"the conciliatory spirit of leaders who led as much in peace as in war...by their example, exhortation and their deeds...spoke as citizens of not two lands, but one, thereby bringing the country together.\\"<br />Consequently, Professor Winik carefully arranges his evidence to buttress his argument that the greatest men of both the Union and Confederacy understood this unique historical opportunity.  These men  --  especially Lincoln, Grant, and Lee  --  were aware of the centrifugal forces of civil war and the enormous danger of guerilla warfare, of terrorism, as a post-war phenomena.  Winik's life experiences as a congressional staff member undoubtedly inform his sensibilities about the fragility of national identity in societies torn apart by internal war and unresolves social stresses.  Winik admires the eerily charitable awareness of the physically-ravaged Abraham Lincoln; he extols the decision-making of U. S. Grant, a man reviled as a \\"butcher\\" of his own troops, at Appomatox; he lionizes Robert E. Lee as a moral leader of near messianic proportions for what Winik determines to be a monumental surrender, not only of his Army, but of the idea of Southern nationality.  <br />Yet, \\"April 1865\\" is not without its flaws, the most serious of which, in my opinion, is its minimizing the impact of race and slavery on the Civil War and American society.  Winik oftens writes about \\"the South\\" as if some 4,000,000 African-Americans didn't live there, principally as slaves.  His prose tends to downplay the outrageous physical, social and moral degradation human bondage caused.  In fact, Professor Winik goes out of his way to speak about tender-hearted moments masters shared with their slaves and how devoted slaves were to their masters.  When he speaks of how the Confederacy debated and ultimately determined to manumit its African-American slaves if only they were to fight on the South's side, his writing makes one wonder if the the men and women of Dixie weren't secret abolitonists their entire lives.  <br />Particulary galling is his omission of race as a cornerstone of Southern \\"nationality.\\"  Professor James McPherson has ably discussed the notion of Southern herrenvolk democracy  --  the notion that all Southern whites were equals (despite gross differences in wealth) because of their superiority to African Americans  --  and for Professor Winik to ignore this mind-set is to dangerously ally himself with the \\"moonlight and magnolia\\" school of thought on the South and its \\"peculiar institution.\\"  Does anyone seriously believe that if the Confederacy had won the Civil War, African-Americans would have been grantedfreedom and the rudiments of civil and political rights?  Winik writes over five pages about the talents of iconoclastic Southern commander Nathan Bedford Forest without ever mentioning Forest's crucial involvement in the creation of the Ku Klux Klan immediately after the war.  It comes as no surprise, therefore, that Winik annoints Robert E. Lee, and not Abraham Lincoln, as the superstar of the Civil War. <br />With this reservation in mind, \\"Arpil 1865\\" is a supremely impressive work.  Winik's description of the abandonment and ruin of Richmond, Virginia is terrifying in its detail.  His vivid recounting of the savage hand-to-hand combat immediately preceding the cessation of hostilities will upset even the most hard-hearted reader.  The professor's biogaphical sketches breathe dimension and insight into the essential actors on the historical stage.  Above all, Jay Winik deserves praise for his articulate and compelling argument about the development of a true national identity as a consequence of war, a uniquely positive outcome when all of past history points in the opposite direction.	2002-06-02

Instead, this dreary, choppy story drowns in a disaffecting stew of alcohol, profanity and confusion.  <br />If that weren't bad enough, Ms. Yamanaka has abandoned those qualities which make her previous books luminescent.  Instead of using the patois of the island's lumpenproletariat, she forces her characters to mouth lines a television soap-opera writer would be embarrassed to use.  Yamanaka's earlier works feature characters whose pain, isolation and dislocation compel both empathy and identification; the people who populate \\"Four Passages\\" are, ugly, mean and brutish.  Her protagnoist, Sonia Kurisu, is a pathetic loser, completely without redeeming qualities.  Her most salinet attribute is her seemingly endless capacity for self-pity.  Yamanaka has failed so miserably in humanizing Sonia, that the protagnoist's ruined childhood  --  replete with abandonment, religious hypocrisy and sexual insecurities  --  engenders boredom rather than compassion.  The supporting cast is even worse; stereotypical relatives and other low-life losers are simply unbelievable.  <br />This lack of reality and basic believability crushes whatever art \\"Four Passages\\" may pretend to have.  Even Yamanaka's style mocks her ability.  For reasons beyond my ability to understand, Ms. Yamanaka frequently capitalizes words in the middle of the sentences.  (Is this because what we are reading is some kind of experimental prose/poetry?)  Her narrative dissipates its energy between unimpressive transitions from present to past.  An absent father's poetic, third-person letters to Sonia, serve as constant reminders as to the unreality of the novel's entire premise. <br />Sadly, \\"Father of the Four Passages\\" reminds us that even our  most creative and bold young authors miss their mark.  This brutally vulgar novel fails.  It fails to provide insight into the shattered hopes of a frightened, bewildered single parent.  It fails to create characters with any dimension.  It fails to enlighten, inform and instruct.  However, its single greatest failure is its author's abandonment of those talents which rightfully propelled Lois-Ann Yamanaka to national attention.	2002-05-26

Accurately subtitled \\"Growing Up Jewish in Mississippi,\\" Edward Cohen's enjoyable and instructive memoir recounts the author's childhood in post World-War II Mississippi and explores the dynamics of being a dual outsider:  A Jew in the Bible Belt and a southern Jew in a cosmopolitan Jewish university.  Written with perceptive sociological insight and engaging self-deprecatory humor, this memoir sheds light on the profound issue of marginality.  As Edward Cohen grows up, he leaves the safe cocoon of his protective Jewish home and discovers the strangely alluring and frightening Christian South.  <br />The grandson of an intinerant peddler, Cohen explains both the coherence of a Jewish life and the centripetal influences the dominant culture exerts on that identity.  Once in the public school system, Cohen feels a need to reinvent himself, from invisible Jew to iconoclastic rebel.  Yet, with each recreation, Cohen feels less complete, even more dissatisfied.  Where he yearns for a fusion of his dual Southern/Jewish identities, he experiences alienation and distancing from both.  Culminating with four experimental years at Miami University, his story both extols and berates the divisive nature of his existence.  <br />At its best, \\"The Peddler's Grandson\\" serves as a model for every immigrant seeking authentic identity in his/her new land.  At once desperately seeking inclusion but discovering that the price of admission is cultural abdication, Cohen warns about the notion that one can gain identity by erasing one's past.  \\"From the first day my Jewish self was suddenly full-immersion baptized into that southern world, I wanted to reconcile what couldn't be joined.\\"  We watch, with admiration, as Cohen reaches an adult acceptance of who and what he is.  \\"I've learned the difference between discovering who I am and inventing it.  Invention for me meant erasure, and whether it was my southern or my Jewish half that I hoped to lose, each time I tried, I got smaller.\\"<br />\\"The Peddler's Grandson\\" is not pedantic in the least.  Delightful family history and marvelous anecdotes pepper this memoir.  Cohen's battles with the dyspeptic Rabbi Nussbaum over issues ranging from the existential meaning of life to the Edward's refusal as a child to eat a hard-boiled egg at Passover ring with Jewish humor.  With characteristic grace, however, is Cohen's admission that he admires his adversary as a civil rights' leader.  The author does not have to mention that Nussbaum's home was bombed by the Ku Klux Klan; yet in so doing, Cohen reminds us of his own profound ambivalence over racism during the late 1950s and early 1960s.  One senses that the adult Cohen has not forgiven himself for his acquiescent silence during that crucial decade; indeed, his compassionate recounting of the African-Ameicans who worked in his family's clothes store indicate a sensitivity that began during that formative period. <br />Cohen writes with an assurance he lacked as a child.  His memoir is warm, comforting, and, in parts, genuinely inspiring.  The author's adult confidence derives, however, from that childhood, both Southern and Jewish.  His adult confidence in his roots and his place in both worlds blossoms from a family which, although profoundly assimilated, nevertheless recognized its marginality.  His Jewish identity, compromised by an alien culture which celebrated physicality instead of intellectualism,  emerges secure; his Southern roots, nurtured by three generations of life in Jackson, Mississippi and tarnished by national denigration of the very name of his state, endure.  Thus, Edward Cohen, child of a Jewish peddler who settled in a locale far beyond the reaches of Northern urban Jewish influence, represents the best of the Ameican expeience; his cultural dialectic results inthe best of all possibilities  --  a genuine multiculturalism.	2002-05-24
US	50747195	R56K3KRAH5R4Q	0393322904	434193830	Rides of the Midway: A Novel	Books	3	4	12	N	N	debut novel disappoints; superficial characters abound	Amidst the hundred of pages of describing the drug-saturated life of alienated protagonist Noel Weatherspoon, author Lee Durkee sadly betrays the considerable comedic talents he possesses as a writer.  \\"Rides of the Midway\\" could have been a wicked, dark satire on the 1970s, a time when the flowering of the drug culture reached even backwater Southern cities and created a class of alienated, self-absorbed young people whose anguised lives reflected distortions, induced not only by drugs, but by  sleepwalking through their lives, absent social purpose and serious human connection.  Instead, despite its flashes of terrific humor and delightfully etched descriptive passages, \\"Rides\\" fails in a particularly sad way.  <br />Lee Durkee attempts to create a dark comedy and social commentary through the live of his protagonist.  Possessed by visions of the dead, thoroughly frustrated by his virginity and repeated failures with women, ensnared in a recreated family headed by a nefarious step-father, Noel Weatherspoon could have been a captivating character.  Instead, readers wade through excessive descriptions of his seemingly interminable adventure with drugs (literally hundreds of pages) at the expense of developing any identification or empathy with his character.  As if that weren't cruel enough, the author refuses to invest any of his other characters with much believability.  Noel's rebellious mother inexplicably chooses to remarry a born-again idiot.  Noel's encounters with a religion professor's wife reads like a sex manual for frustrated teens.  Noel's relationships  --  friendship is far too intimate a term for his association with men of his own age  --  are so shallow and unidimensional as to border on the superfluous.  Noel's visions of ghosts  --  his father and a young boy sent into coma as a result of a freak baseball collision with Noel  --  could have been the saving grace of the novel.  Instead, these surreal visions provide the only welcome reflief from alcohol, tobacco and a cornucopia of illegal drugs.<br />Durkee also flounders with attempts at symbolism.  The darkly meaningful midway ride, associated with his father's disappearance, receives mention in the evocative pologue and then dissolves in significance.  Noel's uncle, representative of truth and freedom, has far too insignificant of a role.  Ben, Noel's innocent half-brother, serves mainly as a device to advance the central theme of the novel.  <br />\\"Rides of the Midway\\" is not without merit.  Devotees of kinky sexuality will find interesting and bizarre practices.  Readers who enjoy learning about what happends to young people when they embark on drug binges will not leave the novel hungry.  Durkee knows how to write and write well, and his style alone makes reading \\"Rides\\" tolerable.  Yet, novelists must do far more than make us laugh or shake our heads in disbelief.  Perhaps Mr. Durkee will realize his potential when he learns that great novelists capture our desire to identify with their characters, understand how those characters illuminate the human condition and teach us enduring lessons of life.	2002-05-17

As the Nazis were about to undertake the complete annihilation of European Jewry, the existing quip, \\"Who remembers the Armenians?,\\" served to assuage any anxiety about the historical responsibilities of the perpetrators.  Oblivion assists genocidal murderers; they despise memory, for remembrance sanctifies victims and reminds us of the desperate pain and transcendant suffering those victims experienced during the process of their effacement from the world.<br />Thus Micheline Aharonian Marcom's exquisite \\"Three Apples Fell from Heaven\\" is a novel used as historical vengeance.  It not only chronicles the Ottoman Turks frighteningly successful attempted genocide of her Armenian ancestors; the novel emereges as a full-blown triumph of memory, family and culture.  Redolent with a sensory array of violence (ranging from the sexual to the excremental), \\"Three Apples\\" puts faces on victims, perpetrators and bystanders.  The former becomes tangible; Armenians have names, faces, families, foods, and language.  The Turks not only set out to murder people, but to eradicate centuries of historical co-existence.  Reading this harrowing, segmented novel will remind readers how precious and tenuous multiculturalism is and how hard members of a diverse society must work to maintain not only tolerance, but dignity and mutuality.<br />\\"Three Apples\\" is not an easy novel to read.  Written in abrupt chapters (some of which are no longer than one page) and swirling in time, the novel relies on its characters, who become living symbols of degradation, despair, and survival.  In places, central characters observe the disintegration of others and lament their own powerlessness to oppose humiliation.  Sargis, a sensitive poet sequestered in women's clothes in his mother's closet, presents a terrifying description of anhonored professor's degradation and descent into madness after being jailed and tortured.  Sargis' subsequent existential rumination on the nature of evil is more than mere academic wonderings.  As to what provokes evil, Sargis asks, \\"Does it live in all of us, regardless of blood or kin, like a viper waiting in the hollow of a fir tree?  Should we step lightly around the perimeter of every fir tree?  Do we carry hollows, and in them this thing, expectant?\\"  Despite his obsession with bodily orifices, Sargis arouses our most profound sympathy; his demise hurts deeply.<br />When Ms. Marcom describes the death of infants on forced marches and involuntary exile, she underscores the uncounted number of absolutely defenseless Armenians who perished in brutal exodus.  Western indifference resonates with quiet ugliness through the dispatches of American consul Leslie Davis.  This effete functionary writes painfully accurate accounts of mass deportations and murder but easily interrupts his official responsibilities whenever a game of bridge beckons.  His awareness and lack of response symbolizes the facade of neutrality and feigned concern.  His conscience, which compels written recounting, is mute, ultimately false.<br />Ever present in this novel is Ms. Marcom's need to honor her heritage and family.  Her maternal grandmother, a rare survivor, is the source of the novel and her mother provides inspiration.  Writing \\"Three Apples\\" serves as an act of hope as well as anger.  By trusting readers with memory, the author wisely reminds us that the living have enormous responsibilities to the past.  As we read and become repulsed by the plight of the Armenians, we must also gain our courage to remember the martyrs in our daily lives.  It is for the living to combat the evils that produce the impulse for genocide.  Michelene Aharonian Marcom not only honors her family; she bestows hope for the human possibility that good may overcome evil.	2002-05-08

Kathleen Cambor's  brilliant \\"In Sunlight, in a Beautiful Garden\\" succeeds on numerous levels in providing physical, sociological and psyhcological understandings of this catastrophy cavalierly caused by the greed, arrogance and brutal indifference of America's new industrial titans, the very captains of industry revered in the heady capitalistic period following the Civil War.  Written with uncommon precision, compassion and insight, the novel completely captures the reader's imagination, trasporting one to Johnstown, an industrial city that houses a steel factory that devours its workers, and an aristrocratic summer resort, home of Pittsburgh's wealthy seeking escape from the inferno-like conditions of that steel city.  Ms. Cambor's characters are fully realized people; their conflicts express universal themes.  The writing is unfailing in its descriptions of the setting; eloquent and soaring in places, the novel is evidence of a writer who truly works for her readers.<br />There can be no mistaking the author's anger at the appalling indifference and disdain the wealthy plutocrats express towards the working men and women of Johnstown.  Safely ensconced in the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, eerily icy men such as Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Mellon enjoy the trappings of summer idylls while maintaining an absolute indifference to the consequences of their ease.  The wealthy who summer at the club, with few exceptions, are symbolically as corrupt and insubstantial as the dam which provides the artificial lake around which their affairs are planned.  Cambor captures the evil of social invisbility persuasively; one of the hidden delights of \\"In Sunlight...\\" is its subtle class consciousness and bitter recognition that even when \\"natural\\" disasters strike, the poor invariably get hit harder.<br />As cogent as Ms. Cambor's sociological observations are, her psychological explorations are even more profound.  In parallel stories, \\"In Sunlight...\\" examines the causes and consequences of dissolving marriages.  Frank and Julia Fallon bring divergent backgrounds to their union, and the catastrophic stresses wrought by a diptheria outbreak (exquisitely detailed through the eyes of the distraught Julia) led to a slow, painful loss of love and connection.  James and Evelyn Talbot contrast vividly.  Repressed and lonely, aggressive in their pursuit of status, their marriage disintegrates as the husband discovers conscience.  That their offspring, the proud, inquisitive and introspective Daniel and the quietly inisitent Nora become attracted to each other is one of the delights of the novel.<br />Delicate, compelling and lyrical, \\"In Sunlight...\\" firmly establishes Kathleen Cambor's reputation.  This work is nothing less than astounding.	2002-05-01

Stilled by cancer at the age of thirty-one, Matt Clark leaves us only one book through which we can judge his literary talents.  There is little question that Mr. Clark possessed a love for language and a tart, skewed sense of humor.  Yet his novel, \\"Hook Man Speaks\\" is terribly disappointing.  Using the promising techinque of describing life through an archtypical figure of terror's eyes, Clark's work is neither illuminating, satirical nor compelling.  \\"Hook Man Speaks\\" is bland, boring and banal.  Save both your money and your time; select something else, anything else, to read.<br />Save the clearly delightful descriptive writing, Clark sadly fails at every goal he has set for himself.  Cross-cutting narratives serve little purpose but to disrupt an already weak story line.  Unbelievable in and of himself, the Hook Man interacts with a series of characters so one-sided and unbelievable that they, and not he, are the objects of the reader's disappointment.  Particularly obnoxious is Professor Brautigan, whose literary purpose is to permit readers an \\"undersanding\\" of the Hook Man;  instead, this character embodies practically every stereotype of a frustrated, irrelevant university scholar.  When Mr. Clark permits the reader to glimpse into the childhood of the Hook Man, he entices us with the possibility of compassion.  That hope is wrenched away abruptly as the author determines to stultify his reading audience with pathetically implausible encounters with axe murderers and a woman whose feet allegedly were gnawed off by rats while eating Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br />No reviewer enjoys casting aspersions on the talent of artists whose lives were cut short by disease or disaster.  Yet, since Berkley Books has chosen to publish this work posthumously and other noted writers (including Darin Strauss and Elizabeth Gilbert) have gushed praise over \\"Hook Man,\\" my criticism of the novel may become as irrelevant as what I consider the work to be itself.	2002-04-21

As if that weren't enough, the author's abundant knowledge of and love for the Carolina Appalachian area saturates her writing and breathes life into that often overlooked part of our nation.<br />Just as Kaye Gibbons' &quot;Charms for the Easy Life&quot; features three utterly absorbing women, Pamela Duncan entices us with three generations of Moon women and makes them all so stout-hearted and morally ambitious that we become conflicted as to which women is our favorite.  The youngest, Ashley, is the most flawed but emerges as the most complicated character.  Conflicted over repudiation of her past and adrift in a prenancy that appears to lead her to oblivion, Ashley's struggle to understand her self, her past and her place comes to symbolize the universal quest for young women to simultaneously become autonomous yet interdependent  --  with their families, their lovers, their past.  The middle-aged Ruth Ann, freshly divorced and anguished over the sudden barren nature of her life, must cope with her daughter's condition and her mother's deteriorating physical and mental status.  Ruth Ann's ambivalence over the modern expectations of a suddenly-single woman requires her to summon her reserves of strength, resolve and humor.  The crusty matriarch Marvelle glistens;the author's use of internal monologue gives grace and dignity to an elderly grandmother who otherwise may be only one stubborn step from the grave.  <br />&quot;Moon Women&quot; succeeds on many levels.  Even the secondary characters vibrate with intensity and integrity. Ashley's suitor, Keith, reminds us that this author understands the male heart as well as the female; his quiet patience and absolute devotion permit him to transcend his own familial heartbreak and personal disintegration.  Ms. Duncan's understanding of personal epiphany is eloquent and moving:  &quot;Ruth Ann saw for just the blink of an eye the creator's touch on her mama's head, on her children, on them all.&quot;  As the three women become alive to each other, they illuminate the human condition.  With tender wisdom, delightful humor and complete confidence, Pamela Duncan reminds us that we are at our best when we try to endure.  We triumph not by power, wealth or status, but by trust, family and love.	2002-04-17

Suzanne Matson is little less than brilliant in her wise, sad and compelling novel, \\"A Trick of Nature.\\"  Through the terrible force of this freak accident, a family's facade is crumbled, and its members forced to face the raw and painful realization of unexamined lives, suppressed rebellion and desperate dissatisfaction.  That Ms. Matson so convincingly allows her characters to suffer, to wrestle with frightening questions, to make awful mistakes and to learn to live with newborn responsibility and freedom testifies to her skill as a writer and great compassion for the human condition.<br />Each of the fascinating characters which populate \\"A Trick of Nature\\" has his/her life altered by the accident and its consequences.  Told through multiple perspectives but interwoven gracefully in a manner which both advances and illuminates both the plot and themes, the novel's focus on its tormented, befuddled and anguished characters emerges as its most impressive strength.  Greg Goodman, whose quiet reserve and emotional detachment for his wife and daughters, confronts his own guilt by embarking on actions which not only disorient his own life but disrupt his household.  Suspended from his teaching job, his marriage disintegrates, his twin teen daughters spin off in separate worlds, and he undertakes a perilous search for Tim's mother, partly to understand his own responsibility and partly out of a guilt so enormous, so consuming that it distorts his ability to function.  Greg's wife, Patty, in turn responds to the paradoxical pressures of he life by leaving her home.  An obsessive housekeeper who controls and programs practically every movement inside her house, Patty feels liberated by the act of abandonment; work refreshes and familial ties weaken.  Her lonely journey into independence rings true in its melancholy and consequences.  Tim's mother, Lorraine, receives exceptional treatment.  A woman who abandoned her child at an early age, she lives a near nihilistic life, and her encounter and developing relationship with Greg proves pivotal to the resolution of the novel's central conflicts.<br />Suzanne Matson ably joins other modern authors who have explored the disintegration of middle-class marriage and the sudden, unexpected and ironically unwelcomed obligation of adults to come to grips with both the need to learn their true identities and to understand how and why marriages work.  What makes \\"A Trick of Nature\\" so exceptional is its compassion and tenderness.  This sad, painful novel consumes the reader;  from its inception, the author has delicately interwoven the anguish and confusion of its characters into the texture of our own lives.  As Greg and Patty face their own demons, their lives become even more insecure.  It is this insecurity, this lack of certain answers and the comfort of day-to-day routine, which gives the novel its purchase.	2002-03-31

This novel is an engrossing work which not only absorbs the reader's attention with its sensitive and provocative treatment of the twin themes of fulfilled and unrequited love; it engages the reader in a profoundly personal manner through its exploration o the inner lives of its complex, sympathetic and utterly believable characters.  Set at the turn of the twentieth century in rural Georgia, \\"Taking Lottie Home\\" is an utterly modern novel as well; its characters' yearnings, frustrations and anxieties elicit the deepest sympathies from the reader.<br />\\"Taking Lottie Home\\" treats an enigmatic, yet magnetic, girl-woman, Lottie Barton and her eliptical travels through the rural southeast in an attempt to discover \\"home.\\"  Lottie's exquisite physical beauty casts a surreal attraction from both lustful men and jealous women.  The product of squalid poverty and blighted hopes, Lottie ironically becomes the focus of a liberating friendship with Ben Phelps, whose altruistic interest in Lottie results in numerous moral conundrums.  In her life's travels, Lottie, through volition and resignation, has submitted to prostitution, an troubled marriage and attractions understated, Lottie becomes the focus of the three main male characters in the novel.  The aforementioned Ben Phelps befriends Lottie and serves as her guardian at the request of his baseball-playing friend, Foster Lanier.  Lanier and Phelps share blighted athletic careers, though their friendship circles around Lottie.  Lanier marries Lottie and fathers her child; Ben learns that platonic love carries explosive connotations.  Ben's ultimate employer, Arthur Ledford, will nurture his own complicated relationship with Lottie, and Kay masterfully interweaves the complications of these connections throughout the novel.<br />One of the marvelous qualities of \\"Taking Lottie Home\\" is that although it is not a terribly original book, it succeeds on every level.  Kay's creative treatment of the awful consequences of tormeted silence, innocent deceit and unfulfilled dreams is nothing less than brilliant.  Lottie and Ben arouse enormous empathy as they grapple with their decisions and directions.  The author's accurate portrait of small-town Southern life some hundred years ago strengthens the novel's thematic coherence and integrity of characterization.  \\"Taking Lottie Home\\" packs an enormous emotional wallop; it is an inspirational, challenging and evocative triumph.	2002-03-26

The men who would don British uniforms would fight for a myriad of purposes:  out of anger against the unspeakable evil of the Holocaust, from an awareness that they were living rebukes to the notion that Jews served as deseerving recipients of passive suffering, with a sense of their historical  purpose of establishing a Jewish homeland and becoming ironic adversaries of the very nation (Britain) which enlisted their service.<br />Though \\"The Brigade\\" nobly treats the themes of Jewish armed resistance, vengeance and ultimate salvation, this memorable history above all signals the profound development of a renewed Jewish identity, forged in battle against the background of genocide and ruin, tested by personal sorrow and fortified by a messianic vision of a Jewish homeland for the shattered remnants of European Jewry.  The Jewish fighters are proud, heroic and consecrated to their vision; they become increasingly aware of their role in a Jewish future.  Initially consumed by rage and the obvious need to crush their German enemy, the three members of The Brigade on whom this history focuses evolve morally.  From muderous avengers of the crime of mass murder, these men ultimately perceive their role as guardians of those Jews who survived the Holocaust, especially the children, as central to their lives' meaning.<br />Rich in specific military detail, \\"The Brigade\\" is at its best when depicting the personal transformation of its three featured soldiers.  Each comprehends a remarkable epiphany during Passoverin 1945; each becomes acutely aware of his Jewishness, his place in the enormous task confronting him.  The aloof, aristocratic Johanan Peltz discovers his \\"inescapable and defining\\" bond with common Jews.  \\"He could neither hide from nor deny it...He was another Jew walking down a long corridor toward a communal destiny.\\"  Studious and devoted to his family, Arie Pinchuk finds the moral strength to reconsecrate himself to the search for his family.  The contentment of Passover contrasts painfully with that which \\"had been taken from him,\\" and he resolves that only by redeeming and reclaiming his family could he once again recapture the peace of the holiday.  Israel Carmi, a brilliant tactician and resourceful leader of the Jewish Palestinian underground, celebrates the Passover under fire.  Yearning for his family in Palestine, Carmi is struck with the awareness \\"that this makeshift seder in a trench crowded with Jewish soldiers was making all the future seders possible.\\"<br />Blum also deftly interstitches the remarkable story of Leah Pinchuk, Arie's sister.  Leah's survival quietly and convincingly  emerges as a methaphor of the Holocaust.  She is a living embodiment of the modern state of Israel.  Mr. Blum is also capable of eloquence as well.  His description of Carmi and Peltz's encounter with Jewish survivors of Mauthausen devastates the reader.  The survivors \\"found it easier to imagine that angels, not Jewish soldiers, were standing in front of them.\\"  When one weak, old man steps towards Peltz and touches \\"the tip of his finger tentatively to the skin of Peltz's outstretched hand,\\" it is as if time and history stop.  \\"Bound by their deep shared sorrow,\\" the men embrace and mourn together.<br />\\"The Brigade\\" is an especially important history given the peril of Israel's existence today.  At a time when Holocaust denial and distortion are perniciously used against Israel, at a time when many in the world are still profoundly ignorant of the moral imperativeof that beleaguered nation and at a time when much of the world is more comfortable with Jews who suffer than Jews who fight back, \\"The Brigade\\" serves as a reminder of Jewish strength, resolve and hope.	2002-03-20

The crackling pace of the novel, however, does not diminish the superior characterizations which provide complexity and depth to an otherwise exciting, but non-groundbreaking, novel.  Indeed, the psychological tensions of the Moran family  --  their origins, impact and resolution  --  are the genuine backbone of the novel.  Relationships twisted by guilt, abandonment, resentment and resignation become the true focus of the reader's attention; the ever-present dampness and density of growth of the area become symbolic counterpoints to the aridity of human contact the Moran mother and daughter have with one another. <br />Ironically, this fecund environment (lavishly described by Ms. Reynolds) has generated a remarkably fractured family.  The angry matriarch, Lila Moran, capably presides over a logging empire while bemoaning the condition of her personal life.  Her son, Jonah, never has emerged as a man, and instead of acknowledging his retardation due to a relatively rare neurological disorder, Lila prefers to rue his adult childhood obsession with Civil War figures.  As disappointed as she is with her son, she saves a special animosity for her daughter, Jessica, who has returned home after a failed marriage and an unsatisfying adulthood.  Jessica's anguish centers around the tragic drowning death of her father, who perished while attempting to rescuse Jonah, who was precipitously thrown in the water by Lila, in a brutally cruel manner of teaching him to swim.  This scar runs like a red thread through \\"Civil Wars\\" and only through Jessica's renewal of a relationship with the sympathetically-portrayed Callum Lake is there any chance of healing.  Callum, unfortunately, never receives the in-depth portrait he otherwise richly deserves.  His adolescent feelings for Jessica serve both as personal and dramatic motivation in the resolution of the arson/murder investigation which professionally absorbs his time.<br />There is much to admire in Marjorie Reynolds' writing.  She can, without questions, probe to the inner recesses of our emotions and provide unflinching portraits of both human good and evil.  She is a nuanced writer as well, always writing to make her characters believable.  My sole reservations with her second novel are small, but critical.  The reader knows, from the first fifty pages, that the plot will be resolved tidily; Lila and Jessica's coming-to-grips with their own unresolved hurt and betrayal appears almost like a soap opera.  The author's brilliant first novel, \\"The Starlite Drive-in\\" did not have these flaws.  Nevertheless, \\"Civil Wars\\" is an honorable, penetrating look into a family at war with itself.	2002-03-12

How pleasant can it be to write about your childhood home given its now ubiqitous reputation as America's citadel of crime and corruption?  The enormous moral and social courage alone Helene Stapinski had to muster to describe her life in Jersey City in the last third of the twentieth century make her memoir \\"Five-Finger Discount\\" worth reading.  At times maddening, frightful, depressing and hilarious, the memoir magically brings us into the Stapinski family  --  with its heritage of crime, violence and family abuse  --  while simultaneously providing us with an enormously readable history of Jersey City, a place so corrupt, so venal, so thoroughly crooked, that its moral taint seems to rub off, along with sundry industrial residues, on its population.  Indeed, theft is so common, that swag, as it is called, is not even considered wrong; it is simply a way of life.  Thus, Stapinski's subtitle, \\"A Crooked Family History\\" is appropriately accurate, both a description of of her own personal circumstances, but as that of the larger political community, whose criminality looms everywhere.<br />As a child, Helene never considers her family anything but normal.  Living upstairs from a neighborhood bar, she accepts the arrest of her abusive grandfather Beansie (a nickname derived from the fact that he stole some beans from a truck earlier in his life) as normal, the most recent of \\"a string of family crimes and tragedies, which I thought most people experienced on a regular basis.\\"  The diminuitive Beansie, nothing more than a small-time bully and crook, becomes the central lens through which Stapinski examines her family history.  Not an intellectual crook, like some of her other relatives, Beansie \\"was more of a freelance criminal, committing crimes whenever the opportunity arose.\\"  An abusive husband and father, Beansie's welcomed disappearances into jail provide the family with its only opportunity for coherence and sanity.  <br />As she grows, Helene prefers attending well-fed funerals than going through the Holland Tunnel to New York City to play with new toys in the showrooms of Macys.  She relishes watching the numbers game, which to her was a community activity, and rejoices at the number of people who \\"hit\\" on her birthday.  She learns from \\"my mother to stand up for myself and to dislike careless and unfair people.  There were quite a few of them living in Jersey City.\\"  This linkage with Jersey City and family identity emerges as one of the strengths of the memoir.<br />Stapinski's portrait of Jersey City will stagger the uninitiated.  Literally staring at the backside of the Statue of Liberty, this city, pillored as once and always \\"ugly,\\" was the debarcation spot for millions of immigrants who passed through Ellis Island.  Jersey City, howeve, became a place \\"settled for,\\" inhabited by settlers \\"of a different kind, the kind who always feel cheated, because they settled for less.\\"  It is a place where \\"people were actively illiterate and proudly went around saying things like 'I never read a book in my life.'...I wanted to say, 'Well, good for you, you idiot.  Look where you are.  You're still in Jersey City.'\\"  It is a city where spring is not announced by \\"tulips or crocuses,\\" but by the first \\"floated or dead body to wash ashore\\" from the Hudson River.  The author gracefully ties the political corruption of the notorious Democratic Mayor, Boss Hague, to the personal corruption of her grandfather, Beansie.<br />The adult Helene Stapinski returns to Jersey City, despite an incomplete attempt at personal liberation through university life and intellectual freedom.  Working in the \\"knewsroom\\" of the city's newspaper, the Jersey Journal,  Stapinski grows more reflective on her family's place in this morass.  Anger, disgust and outrage over civic graft intertwines andconflicts with family shame and a need to protect her mother.  Uncovering family involvement in a civic scandal, Stapinski upbraids her own silence.  \\"I told myself that journalistic ethics were for people more fortunate than I...They were for people whose parents could afford them, whose families didn't have to rely [on politically connnected public jobs].  I was rationalizing, but it beat ratting out my mother.\\"  She comments immediately after that if Stapniski were to report of \\"courthouse swag, I would have to get rid of at least half of my wardrobe.  Then I would have to find Ma a new job, because she would be fired, or worse, ostracized from her circle of swag-buying friends.\\"<br />\\"Five-Finger Discount\\" never preaches, never loses its humanity, never pinches its nose in disgust.  It is a dirty, messy, bloody, grinding work.  Its majesty derives from the lucidity of its writing, the moral vision of its author, and its bold personal and historic intent.  This memoir is personal history at its best.  The memoir preserves a scarred city's battered, ugly past and gives it life for current and future generations; it captures a trapped family  --  limited by poverty, hopelessness and resignation  --  and gives it the dignity of its own self-definition.  Helene Stapinski's work will emerge as a treasured addition to not only urban history, but to the growing body of literature of the very nature of the American family.	2002-03-07

A believer of signs, this twenty-year-old single mother searches for the means to become both independent and whole.  She comes to live next door to Rose Nelson, whose life has shut down since the tragic accidental death of her only son some five years earlier.  Their lives intertwine in Anne LeClaire's affecting, inspiring and compelling debut novel, \\"Entering Normal.\\"  LeClaire's writing is both fast-paced and emotionally wrenching, as both women deal with broken or frozen hearts.  <br />\\"Entering Normal\\" is about decent people who are lost and adrift, nursing incredible grief or anger, struggling to find themselves, redefining their basic life assumptions, discovering  --  often despite themselves  --  that life truly does search out life.  Alternatingly exhilarating in its hopes and terribly saddening in its portraits of good people coming to grips with possibilities lost and yearning for renewal, the novel seizes our imagination from the first paragraph and does not relax its solid grip until the last sentence.  Ms. LeClaire sagely treats the implications of small lies, created benignly to protect or defend our loved ones, which evolve into malignant silences, threatening to unravel and ironically hurt the very people the falsehoods were designed to protect.  <br />Despite the marvelous pacing of the narrative of the novel, \\"Entering Normal\\" features a variety of absolutely believable characters.  Opal Gates not only is proud, defiant and indominable in her love for her son Zack, she is also vulnerable, compassionate and confused as to her direction in life.  This malestrom of emotions enriches her personality; LeClaire never permits her to exist as a symbolic sterotype.  Her neighbor, Rose Nelson, is beautifully rendered.  Loving bonds shattered with the death of her son; her dispassionate distance perplexes and vexes her blue-collar husband, Ned.  Shut down and exiled to a self-imposed isolation, Rose's odyssey towards acceptance and understanding comes at great costs.  \\"Normal's\\" minor characters not only advance the action, they give a sense of fullness to the struggles Opal and Rose enounter.<br />Above all, \\"Entering Normal\\" extols the galvanizing impact of friendships and the liberating possibilities of loving relationships.  Through its intriguing discussion of lies, silences and unspoken, thwarted hopes, the novel speaks to how isolative our sorrows and disappointments can become,  so overwhelming and encompassing, in fact, that we may feel swallowed and digested by our burdens.  It is the cardinal grace of this fine novel that the author provides not only solace for those of us who are hurting, but gentle and kind instructions as to how to overcome that self-imposed exile which lies engender.	2002-02-22
US	50747195	R34DWS91YAYHGI	0375410627	177766244	Ava's Man	Books	5	27	27	N	N	soaring, compelling and inspiring addition to family memoir	As impossible as it may seem, Rick Bragg's soaring, compelling and inspiring \\"Ava's Man,\\" his account of the life and time of his maternal grandfather, eclipses \\"All Over but the Shoutin.'\\"  I find it difficult to describe the impact this astounding memoir had on me; I can honestly tell you that I have never wept or laughed (often simultaneously) over the pages of a book as I did while reading \\"Ava's Man.\\"  This work contains more raw material on what life should mean to us and how to live that life than most undergraduate educations.  Through handsomely crafted anecdotes, Bragg has constructed a unique homage  --  to a person, place and time which have passed from the American scene.  As we learn who Charlie Bundrum was, what motivated him and how deeply he influenced those who loved and respected him, we discover a genuine American archtype by which we can measure our own lives.  A memoir Americans will treasure for decades to come, its author has now elevated himself to the highest level of our national letters.<br />The introduction and epilogue alone richly outline the Charlie Bundrum's essential qualities.  A powerful roofer and talented distiller, an angry, violent man who desperately loved and protected his family, a fiercely resilient man who disdained societal restrictions, Charlie Bundrum would be painfully out of place in the modern South.  \\"It is only when you compare him with today...that he seems larger than life.  The difference between then and now is his complete lack of shame.  He was not ashamed of his clothes, his speech, his life.  He not only thrived, he gloried in it.\\"<br />Rick Bragg describes his grandfather as a man \\"whose wings never quite fit him.\\"  Charlie Bundrum took \\"giant steps in run-down boots\\" during the Great Depression, a time of genuine, near desperate want in the rural South.  As a child, Bundrum grew up \\"in hateful poverty, fought it all his life and died with nothing but a family that worshiped him and a name that glows like new money.\\"  Though he moved his family over twenty times during the Depression, his influence on this loved ones was absolute.  He was so beloved, so missed, \\"that the mere mention of his death would make [his grown daughters] cry forty-two years after he was preached into the sky.\\"<br />Rick Bragg's storytelling abilities and extraordinary character sketches draw the reader intimately into the Bundrum family circle.  Bragg's metaphors, piquant, homey and authentic, lend a sense of poetry and size.  For example, Charlie Bundrum's hands, \\"finger-crushing, freakishly strong\\" (he could \\"bend a ten-penny nail in his fingers\\"), and his forearms, \\"hard as fence posts,\\" symbolize the man.  The author's descriptive prose is so pure, so plain,  so true, that in places \\"Ava's Man\\" emerges as this generation's \\"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.\\"<br />The physical setting of the memoir is the hill and river region of northern Alabama and Georgia.  There Charles spent an impoverished youth under the supervision of his hard-bitten father, Jimmy Jim, a dominant man who once bit off a foe's finger during a free-for-all.  From his father, Charles inherited fearlessness.  \\"Too wild for church, too raggedy for the Kiwanis Club,\\" Charles  loved the untamed reaches of the Coosa River; \\"this was his place, even though he did not own enough of it to fill a snuffbox.\\"  As an adult, he lived by his own cardinal rule of fatherhood:  \\"don't let nothin' happen\\" to the children.  The grinding poverty of the Depression only sharpened his instincts; yet the privations of the time would result in the premature death of an infant daughter, the only time his family saw him \\"whipped\\" by circumstances.<br />No saint, the Charlie Bundrum we encounter also has a \\"hot, dark basement\\" where genuine anger lives.  As a fighter, he hit hard, unrelentingly so and he taught his sons to do the same.  He was a considerable drinker, downing a pint of his \\"likker\\" for every gallon he lovingly distilled.  \\"His product was clean,pure and safe as Kool-Aid\\" at a time when others' hooch could kill you.  He was a brawler with the law as well, giving and taking licks to officers capable of catching him.<br />It really doesn't matter where you turn in \\"Ava's Man;\\" Charlie Bundrum emerges larger than life.  Despite his own family's poverty, he adopts Hootie  --  a misshapen, lonely older man  --  and protects him with a devotion that is part ferocity and part altruism.  Charlies' courage is the stuff of myth;  in Bragg's capable hands, Charlie's encounters with bull-headed or misguided adversaries embellish his daughter Margaret's assessment of him:  \\"I knew nothing could ever hurt me with Daddy there.  I knew he would never let it happen.\\"<br />Though Charlie Bundrum is the focus of \\"Ava's Man,\\" Rick Bragg's gifted writing sustains the narrative.  The author's recounting of family tragedies, like the terrifying accidental burning of his mother when she was but a small child, is told with astonishing bluntness.  Yet, his language is so profound, so direct, so genuine, so elementally true, that the stuff of the Bundrums' lives become transcendent, metaphorical, universal.  \\"Ava's Man\\" may become one of the most vital books you will have read in your life.	2002-02-17

Treating the theme of interracial friendship during the formative years of the civil rights movement, \\"Cafe\\" explores the corrosive impact of racism through the evolving relationship between two honorable, frustrated women. Uncommonly understated, Ms. Neilson's writing compels the reader to construct detail, both in the evolution of the plot and the impact of events on the two protagonists.  The novel builds an almost unbearable tension as the reader struggles with such issues as constructing authentic relationships in a social milieu which limits and punishes their creation, the limits and consequences of knowledge, personal and social respnsibility for acts of violence, passion and betrayal, secrecy and its impact on how people respond to each other.  <br />Shackled by societal restrictions, frustrated by personal disappointments and angered by repressed ambitions, the evolving relationship between Fannie and Mattie becomes the central focus of the novel.  Fannie, aware of her heritage as the illegitimate daughter of the town's seamstress, yearns to escape the suffocating constraints of Persia, Mississippi, which in 1962, epitomizes southern rural racism.  Fannie's personal alienation and harnessed hopes for freedom channel her into the kitchen, where she learns of her culinary gift.  In her hands, food becomes transformed into art.  Yet, this same burning drive for experience that elicits creative talent leads her into an ill-conceived and fractious marriage.<br />While in the kitchen of the Persia Cafe, Fannie encounters a defiant, proud black cook, Mattie.  Nursing her own anguish and smoldering resentments at a society which binds her to subservience, Mattie slowly, reluctantly, suspiciously develops a relationship with Fannie.  Mattie is a defiant woman who often speaks in cryptic half sentences; she ponders if Fannie's personal frustrations could lead to a biracial understanding.  Mattie evolves as a central figure; her personal, unspoken knowledge of the details of a racist murder alternately draws and repels Fannie, who is laboring with her own burdens of knowledge  --  of a failed marriage, of derivative responsibility for racial violence, of her own shanmbles of a life.<br />\\"The Persia Cafe\\" contains exquisite descriptions of the physical nature of rural, river life in 1960s Mississippi.  Sweltering heat, earthy smells, the sounds of insects and the river during a summer night capture the reader's imagination.  Ms. Neilson tantalizes us with her exploration of things unbridgeable:  relationships between the races, the shattering of a marriage by a husband's betrayal, the wonder if what we know is actual or imagined.  Persia's racism is ever-present, looming and casting its shadow everywhere; physical violence receives an ugly complement in psychological terror and threat.  Mattie and Fannie's friendship is all the more remarkable given its improbability and inherent danger.  <br />Successful in its treatment of theme, both understated and elegantly detailed,  honorable and true in its exploration of friendship in the midst of racism, \\"The Persia Cafe\\" will join a growing set of works which prove that America is itself coming of age as it explores the wounds and possibilities created during its civil rights era.	2002-02-09

Combining incredibly funny observations about the anguished hopes and frustrated realities of the Kelbow family, the author successfully disguises tart criticism of a terribly bankrupt type of living with a bizarre, bittersweet examination of the separate lives of the Kelbow family. The Kelbows emerge as an archtype: wealthy, smug San Fernando Valley Jews, whose two precocious sons fritter away their lives in fatuous relationships, failed employment and fractured visions of their own importance. \\"Greetings\\" slices and dices the illusion of affluence and the supposed perfection of the Southern California dream; what emerges is the rather shocking and unsettling revelation that Ms. Brenner has held the mirror up to not only the Kelbows, but our national obsession with image, wealth and glitz.<br />\\"Greetings\\" presents a serialized narrative of the central characters who populate the constantly-changing Kelbow family. The central mother figure, Fanny, suffers through two miserable marriages and is constantly aware of her own mother's unspoken disapproval of everything she represents. Fanny's first husband, Don, almost dissolves into caricature; he abandons his marriage and dabbles with practically every cultural fad that Southern California seems to spawn. Andrew, the central character of the novel, is singularly unappealing. His intelligence and sense of slef distorted by excessive indulgence, Andrew is a bland failure at everything -- jobs, family responsibilites, relationships. Stifled by a self-induced inertia, he wandes through the novel in search of commitment. His brother, Little Mike, is a Jewish nightmare come to life. A high-school drop-out, Little Mike develops a taste for alcohol, drugs and deception; his pathetic attemps at righting his corrupt life are masterful examples of social satire.<br />The central conceit of the novel, exquisitely prepared gourmet food, ironically balances the novel's central theme: hunger. Ms. Brenner, with humor and trenchant social commentary, savages a Southern California lifestyle that exalts surface satisfaction but hides genuine anguish, loneliness and falsehood. The Kelbows never get it; phony lifestyle and glitzy trappings are exactly that  --  illusory, unfulfilling and deceptive.  \\"Greetings from the Golden State\\" compels us to observe our culture from the perspective of humor and sarcasm; the result is a biting, witty and true indictment of a type of life to which most of us still aspire.	2002-01-30
US	50747195	R3G2MGLPRIGSZ7	087013535X	177737397	Between the Flowers: A Novel	Books	5	8	8	N	N	posthumous masterpiece blends naturalism and fine characters	After having languished unpublished for over half a century, Harriette Simpson Arnow's magnificent &quot;Between the Flowers&quot; will rightfully restore her reputation as one of the twentieth-century's finest writers.  Compared favorably with John Steinbeck at the onset of her literary career, Arnow's second novel, &quot;Between the Flowers,&quot; failed to inspire publishers.  The novel's dark naturalism and intricately detailed descriptions of the Cumberland River region of eastern Kentucky, now seen as extraordinarily rich qualities, appeared excessively regional and fatalistic to editors in Depression America.  Fortunately, the Michigan State University Press has brought this book to a new generation of Americans, a generation which can appreciate the feminist slant to Arnow's characterization of Delph, the anguished and inarticulate conflicts in her husband Marsh and the exquisite detailing of a region of the United States either ignored or stereotyped by modern society.<br />Arnow's novel combines an overwhelming and frightening naturalism, two admirable, miserable characters who rage against their own flaws, social restrictions and elusive love and a sense of place that exalts the people who reside therein.  Arnow's nature is not some beneficent prop; it is an indifferent overpowering force which mocks human attempts at control.  Marsh and Delph's attempts to scratch out of a living in the midst of drought, heat and flooding appear small and futile in the face of the relentless battering factors of nature.  One of the remarkable facets of this novel is the author's ability to make puny humans appear large in the face of overwhelming odds.<br />The greatest achievement of &quot;Between the Flowers,&quot; however, is the creation of one of the most tormented and sympathetic couples in American literature.  Bound to each other by hunger  --  a deep and unfulfilled yearning for completion and self-respect, Delph and Marsh are ironically ill-suited for each other.  Their passionate needs, which kindled their romance, ultimately cripple their possibilities for mutual happiness.  Delph, the orphaned child of a family known for its rebelliousness, yearns for pesonal libeation, for travel, education and experience.  Frustrated by the isolation of the Cumberland, she envisions an unbound future, kissed by urban experiences and inellectual growth.  Rootless Marsh, a wandering oil-man, seeks place, solidity and permanence; he senses that land  --  owning it, bending it to his will, husbanding it to produce  --  will be his salvation.  &quot;Between the Flowers&quot; is brilliant in its rendering of these two complicated, sympathetic people.  The conflicts and tensions over &quot;the having of things or the holding&quot; advance both the narrative and the philosophical underpinnings of the novel.<br />Readers should not expect an easy time with this novel.  Arnow's style is detailed, relishing in the opportunities to expound on the rugged beauty of the Cumberland, probing the consciousness and consciences of Delph and Marsh as they attempt to understand and live with their relationship.  Arnow's themes of self understanding, family coherence, marital frustrations and disappointments, personal disappointment and self-hatred are given serious, thorough treatment.  What publishers scorned as dense descriptive detail today appears as not only necessary, but  enlightening.  &quot;Between the Flowers&quot; deserves its belated praise.	2002-01-26

Trapped in the socially suffocating environment of Palmyra, Illinois is pre-feminist, mid twentieth-century America, Lucy yearns for a release from the psychological imprisonment she suffers in a mistaken marriage; she knows her life is out of kilter  --  despite being blessed/cursed with exquisite physical beauty  --  but she is not sure of the direction or actions she must take to liberate herself and discover her own authentic self.  &quot;Pretty Is As Pretty Does&quot; is far more than one woman's quest for existential wholeness; it is a biting social commentary and s scathing expose of what women across America experienced in a culture which extolled their physical self and minimized their emotional needs and intellectual capabilities.  This is an extraordinarily capable and important fist novel.<br />Set in a time where feminist complaints were inaudible and a place where small-town virtues locked women into subordinate roles, &quot;Pretty&quot; explores the explosive consequences when one woman takes control of her own life.  This was an America where a woman's good looks were perceived as the best asset to a happy life  --  all attained through marriage to one of the town's wealthiest men, of course.  Lucy is acutely aware of the fleeting nature of her own beauty; she even algebraically computes the half-life of her attractivenss.  Restless, angry, sexually unfulfilled and absolutely convinced that life must have more to offer than watching her porcine husband shovel mounds of food into his mouth, Lucy does not have the array of answers and options clearly available to liberated women of contemporary times.  Ironically, and unconsciously, Lucy seeks fulfillment of her repressed sexual longnings and suppressed existential yearnings through the symbolically-rich character of Billy Lee.  Indeed, Billy's presence as a stranger in the parochial town of Palmyra increases his allure.<br />For Palmyra is a quintessentially sterile town.  It pounds down individuality and siphons away hopes.  Lucy seethes as she reminds us that in her town &quot;thins only come in a couple of colors.  You got your brown and blue and green...What you do in Palmyra is you make a compromise.  You take something else, instead of what you want.&quot;  After but two weeks in a sterile, ugly marriage, Lucy realizes that the seemingly bland townspeople of Palmyra are silently lusting for her to fall, for her to accept being married to corpulent, predictable Bob.  <br />Lucy's attraction to the sultry Billy Lee is not only fraught with sexual tension; it comes to symbolize the difficulties any woman would have in a stifling social system to realize her own identity.  Against her better judgment, she invests him with far more power than he actually has.  Billy senses that Lucy perceives him to be a significant catalyst and he rejects that role while subtlely encouraging her sexual overtures.  Lucy is aroused by Bill's initial refusal to be beguiled by her beauty; one of the delicious ironies of &quot;Pretty&quot; is that the beautiful sexual goddess of the Midwest becomes the beguiled.<br />Alison Clement has written much more than a biting social satire, however.  She adroitly tackles such serious themes as class resentment, sexual fulfillment and racial prejudice.  In fact, the interweaving of thematic difficulties with a strong narrative is one of the signal successes of the novel.  Characterizations never devolve into caricatures; the crippling aspects of small town life often appear under more anonymous circumstances in our nation's larger metropolises.  &quot;Pretty Is As Pretty Does&quot; will enrage, tickle and inspire.  Through Lucy's arduous struggle to adulthood, Alison Clement encourages her readers to fight their own battles for personal liberation.	2002-01-10

Direct, hard-hitting and uncompromising in its sober portrait of American men at war, &quot;The Medic&quot; should serve as a capable antidote to a false romanticization of our GI Joes who fought against Nazi atrocities.  Ironically, the liberating American Army of Leo Litwak realistically is composed of amoral, conniving and bigoted soldiers who know how to fight and also how to enrich themselves from the people they supposedly are liberating and conquering.<br />Litwak's anticipation of fighting the Nazis, after all, was tinctured by the Holocaust; he deeply sensed the enormity of the scale of the destruction of European Jewry.  His decent and left-leaning immigrant parents escaped history, and Leo's collegiate career proved apparent vindication of the open nature of American society.  The collegiate Litwak appreciated philosophy and complexity; the seasoned veteran Litwak learned that simplicity is illusory.  By war's end, Litwak &quot;wanted to strip away any evidence of war...I wanted everything to be simple.&quot;<br />Perhaps the single most memorable character of Litwak's experience is the amoral Maurice, a talented, venal and brutal man, whose voracious appetite for violence, riches and women know no limits.  Maurice's violence cuts a wide swath; as a victor, he genuinely believes in his own omnipotence.  Quietly moral and bound to the medic's code of bearing no arms and tending to all (including the enemy) who may be injured, Litwak feels both a deep sense of repugnance and begrudged admiration at Maurice's example.<br />Almost immediately, Litwak develops a callousness towards death and an impersonal outlook on the afflicted as a survival technique.  Despitea feigned imperviousness to disappointment, he encounters American soldiers so racist, so perverse as to warrant his silent reprobation.  One such soldier is Roy, a cold-hearted killer whose blood thirst and drive for retribution to the Germans is so deep that even Litwak is repelled by him.  A Southern farmer by occupation, Roy sense's Litwak's ambivalence.  After Litwak balks at Roy's desire to inflict immediate revenge, Roy criticizes Leo's reticence:  &quot;You, Doc, a Jew, are too softhearted to operate in this world.  You need coldhearted sons of bitches like me to keep things straight in this world.&quot;  <br />A different sort of soldier, however, is Frank.  Openly egalitarian and brazenly proud of his leftist politics, Frank challenges the Americans to live up to their professed war aims. He constantly reproaches Leo for failing to take stands for his beliefs.  Litwak comments, &quot;Frank was mistaken if he imagined most GIs were out to change the world...They wanted to the world to stay put...GIs wanted their service to pay off with gorgeous women, good jobs, more money, secure families, with nothing else changed.&quot;<br />Litwak knows that the world has changed.  The sheer scope of the conflict, the unspeakable horrors engendered by the Holocaust and the necessary moral refocusing each soldier enacted in order to survive made the prewar world obsolete.  &quot;The Medic&quot; reminds the contemporary reader that the so-called &quot;greatest generation&quot; paid far more than we may realize in defeating its enemies.	2002-01-04

Lyman's &quot;Mad Cowboy&quot; will provoke laughter, outrage and, perhaps, widescale personal and social change.  His writing describes his metamorphosis from failed family farmer to outraged advocate against the very chemical companies which beguiled him to lamentably modify his family's organic farming techniques to large-scale feedlot methods of raising cattle.  We also watch his evolution from a three-hundred pound, ciagarette-addicted, beef-boy to a passionate advocacy of vegetarianism, not merely as a diet, but as a prescription for a healthy world.<br />Despite the title's allusion to anger or insanity, Lyman's book is colored by sadness; it is a lament to the damage done to our bodies, our economy, our geopolitical relationships with other nations and our very earth itself due to our unhealthy reliance on flesh as food and the gross warping of agriculture to satisfying cattle's appetite for grain instead of humanity's needs for nutritious, non-meat based foods.<br />&quot;Mad Cowboy&quot; is at its best when Lyman interweaves his personal story into the fabric of his condemnation of chemical factory farming.  Hard-working and self-effacing, Lyman makes a pivotal decision after graduating from Montana State.  Armed with a battery of &quot;modern&quot; farming techniques  --  all of which are chemically dependent  --  Lyman abandoned his family's traditional organic methodologies or an agribusiness reliance on size and pharmaceuticals.  Ultimately, his chemically-engineered cattle become grostesque consumers of flesh themselves; his once fertile farmland soil thins into degraded desert.  This depressing saga symbolizes Lyman's ironic alienation from the very source of his farm, the earth itself.<br />The muckraking aspects of &quot;Mad Cowboy&quot; are striking enough to sicken even the heartiest meat eater.  With piston-like efficiency, Lyman's paragraphs paint a searing indictment of the large-scale cattle industry.  These feedlot factories produce chemically-altered cattle, fed grains and animal proteins to artifically stimulate growth.  The cattle, in turn, befoul rivers, trample ecosystems and are black holes for grains which could better serve human needs.  Lyman not only criticizes the staggering economic inefficiencies of converting one food form (grain) into another (hamburger); he warns of the moral implications this could have in exacerbating world hunger.<br />His solution is a conversion to a vegetarian way of life.  Though convincing and undoubtedly sincere, Lyman tends to repetitious pronouncements in his concluding chapters.  This is but a small criticism of his work.  &quot;Mad Cowboy,&quot; disturbing and shocking, will be one of those polemics that will remain in the reader's consciousness long after finishing the final page.  His prophetic voice  --  exposing wrong and offering just solutions  --  is mean to upset, educate and radicalize.  In this sense, Howard Lyman's &quot;Mad Cowboy&quot; is an unequivocal success.	2002-01-03
US	50747195	R1ROV6XIIY2HFT	0767902890	852411699	The Things They Carried	Books	5	3	3	N	N	searing, profound and devastating stories of Vietnam War	In what must be considered an autobiographical anthem of his generation, Tim O'Brien's masterful anthology of short stories and thoughtful essays about the war in Vietnam and that war's devastating impact on the sensibilities and consciences of the soldiers who fought is profound, distrubing and extraordinarily illuminating.  &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; drives to the core of that horrifying, frustrating war.  The work also stands as a vehicle by which the author describes how and why he writes stories about the war, what those stories can do  --  both for the reader and the writer, and how stores can shed light on darkness and open imagination to topics the mind would rather not consider.  As O'Brien states, &quot;I want you to feel what I felt.  I want you to know why story-truth is truer sometimes than hnappening-truth.&quot;<br />Each story, deftly anthologized, reveals a distressing, startling or repugnant aspect of the Vietnam War.  O'Brien recounts the spiritual degradation and moral abyss soldiers encountered.  The perceived pointlessness of the war stands counterbalanced by the exquisitely-detailed descriptions of the Vietnamese landscape.  The theatre of war is a literal quagmire, swallowing not only literal life, but symbolic life as well.  Honorable men meet invisible enemies, and the resulting doubt, confusion and terror liberate the most dismal aspects of their personalities.<br />Death surrounds the soldiers, and their perversion of language enables them to survive.  Absent a clear moral imperative for fighting and an obvious enemy to conquer and political goals to realize, O'Brien and his platoon members are left to struggle for the only goal which is important:  survival.  Yet the costs of survival are enormous.  &quot;By slighting death, by acting, we pretended it was not the terrible thing it was.  By our language, which was both hard and wistful, we transformed bodies into piles of waste.&quot;  Thus, an innocent nurse became a &quot;crispy critter;&quot; a baby was a &quot;roasted peanut.&quot;<br />This coarsening of soldiers is one of the necessary concomitants of permitting civil human beings to engage in horrific actions.  But the Vietnam War did not provide American soldiers which the desperately needed moral imperatives, the certainties of purpose and nobility of sacrifice, which could allow the soldier to shed that coarsening upon return to society.  O'Brien's heartbreaking description of the death and recovery of his admired friend Kiowa drives directly to the issue of futility and despair.  Mortally wounded, Kiowa literally sinks into an excrement-filled field and   the platoon becomes encrusted with the stink as they extricate him from the morass.<br />Suffused with guilt, O'Brien successfully brings the reader into this eerily-stretched world.  As soldiers watched their comrades die or lapse into insanity or narcotize themselves on a daily basis or brutalize innocent civilians or maim themselves to escape further exposure, they watched their own lives crumble away.  &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; will stand as a conscience-stricken author's tribute to his comrades, an indictment of the spiritual bankruptcy of that war and a hallmark of how short stories can educate and inspire.	2001-12-31
US	50747195	RM80UCEYZV9FU	0618126929	967619354	Like Normal People	Books	5	5	7	N	N	moving, empathetic and wise account of family love and pain	Memorable and searing, crushing and uplifting, messy and profound, Karen Bender's debut novel, &quot;Like Normal People,&quot; grabs our attention, mesmerizes us with its incandescent language and imagery, and instructs us to the marvelous, unpredictable and transcendent need for familial love.  Its three featured characters deal with profound flaws and disabilities; their enduring quest for understanding, acceptance and place bind them to us.  Each protagonist illuminates a family's history; the matriarch, eldest daughter and youngest daughter's daughter bind themselves to each other in a lattice of pain, confusion and ultimate understanding.  Singularly and collectively, their lives are messy, unfocused, but true.  Like normal people, Ella, Lena and Shelley must confront their lives, and with the resources available to each, accept themselves and learn to cherish each other.<br />Karen Bender accomplishes these tasks in a telescopic fashion.  The retarded Lena has bolted from her assisted living residenced with Shelley; shocked and bewildered, the elderly Ella enlists her other daughter Vivien (Shelley's mother) to help her find them.  Their search involves Ella's painstaking review of her life.  This cross-cutting, between the past and present, invigorates the narrative and gives depth to brilliant characterizations.  <br />Ella has given her life to her now adult retarded daughter.  Possessed with the enormous responsibility of managing a child's life for the rest of her life has both strengthened and weakened Ella.  Devotion to her husband has been supplanted by commitment to her needy child.  The regular rules of parenting are suspended; Lena's differences become a cruel wedge between Ella and the rest of the world.  Even the birth of a &quot;normal&quot; second child, Vivien (whose creative brilliance is balanced by her prescient knowledge that she must be bound by compassion to her older sister), scares Ella that hoping for the future is allowed.  This matriarch's strength is shadowed by her ambivalence; when may Ella feel free, independent, autonomous.<br />Lena presents a different challenge.  Ms. Bender has invested her with authentic feelings, but bound those emotions in a retarded mind.  Surging with needs, attempting to realize some joy and peace in a fragmented, limited existence, Lena's marriage to Bob serves as the crucible through which the three protagonists come fully alive to each other.  Lena is a triumph.  Her anguish, her loneliness and her frustrations render her believable and lamentable.  Her breakthrough understandings may seem small to &quot;normal people,&quot; but emerge as enormous in her self-identity.<br />The tormented Shelley, gripped by a compulsive need to count in multiples of three, symbolizes the possibilities, anxieties and confusions of early adolescence.  Her budding senses of social isolation and incipient sexuality have no outlet other than an intense relationship with her retarded aunt Lena and Lena's retarded husband, Bob.  This relationship ultimately results in tragic consequences, and Shelley's guilt and powerlessness (both in accepting responsibility and not being able to alter the past) both energize and immobilize.  <br />As the three characters struggle with their inner torment, they come to separate epiphanies.  Ms. Bender's final chapters are elegantly written and extremely moving.  In a manner somewhat reminiscent of Sherwood Anderson's &quot;Winesburg, Ohio,&quot; her three protagonists truly come alive to each other.  As Ella, Lena and Shelley learn the truths each needs to continue living, their lives simultaneously expand and contract.  Time stops but vision enlarges.  This seeming contradiction reinforces the central theme of the novel, that even the best-planned lives of normal people are a mess, that only by opening ourselves to the secrets of our soul and the hidden anguish of our hearts do we become truly human.  &quot;Like Normal People&quot; will remain in the reader's consciousness long after the last page is read.	2001-12-20

When the history of the twentieth century is fully comprehended, I have little doubt that this remarkable woman will emerge as one of the most signficant models of honor, decency, morality and personal responsibility.  Ripped from her family and her own personal innocence, Irene Gut never flinched from her private outrage over the evil of genocide; instead, despite the most profound personal outrages committed against her (cruelties which would cause most of us to withdraw from social contact and the ability to feel tenderness), Irene elected to become a savior, personally shouldering the enormous responsibility of hiding Jews, the intended victims of Nazi brutality.<br />Told in a quiet, unassuming voice, &quot;In My Hands&quot; chronicles Irene's &quot;lilac time,&quot; a near idyllic childhood spent in the embrace of a loving, supportive family.  World War II shattered not only her family's coherence, but it irrevocably altered Irene's perception of humanity.  Never wavering in her astounding faith, Irene refused fatalism as a personal philosophy.  Recovering from the most brutal sexual assault imaginable, Irene observes Nazi depradations against Polish Jewry and resolves to stand against it.  <br />Her defiance began, as she reminds us, with &quot;small steps.&quot;  Smuggling food through a fence into a ghetto evolves into secreting Jews in a forest.  This action emboldens Irene to risk both personal autonomy and safety into actually hiding twelve Jews in the basement of a German major's villa.  Never seeking praise or affirmation for her work, cut off from both friends and family, Irene Gut operated in a moral universe solely of her own doing.  Her moral code, &quot;I must take the right path, or I would no longer be myself,&quot; stands as an affirmation of what it means to behuman  --  even more crucial to the understanding of this noble human being is that so few, so very few people adopted her tenacious will to assist the brutalized.<br />Capably assisted by the children's author Jennifer Armstrong, Irene Gut Opdyke reaches the widest audience with &quot;In My Hands.&quot;  Recognized by Israel as one of the &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot; and honored by our United States Holocaust Memorial Museum as a permanent contributor to the study of the Holocaust, Irene Gut Opdyke stands as a moral model.  Her wrenching but deeply instructive memoir tells much more than a life's story; it educates our heart and inspires moral vision.	2001-12-13
US	50747195	R1HI2JLXND4EC3	031228327X	10488731	Joe College: A Novel	Books	4	1	2	N	N	engaging, but flawed, college student avoids dilemmas	Quirky, engaging and, at times, enraging, Tom Perrotta's &quot;Joe College&quot; introduces the reader to a collegiate archtype and explores his responses to the knotty, messy problems he creates for himself and he confronts as an outsider at Yale.  Redolent with the difficulties of a working-class young man assimilating into, becoming part of, and rebelling against the enormous privileges an Ivy-League education, the novel's protagonist, Danny, emerges as a friendly, but ultimately shallow and disappointing young man.  The son of proud, but undereducated working-class parents (Danny's father has recently begun his own lunch-truck business, the &quot;Roach Coach&quot;), Danny alternately masks his intelligence, exploits it to his advantage, and seemingly has an excuse for any action that implicates him in the real world.<br />Therein lie the frustrations of this remarkably well-written and fast-paced novel.  Just at the time Danny seems to be hitting his stride at Yale, having overcome the initial culture shock and academic anxieties, he must come to grips with both a romantic complication and the need to shoulder his father's economic burdens.  In both instances, he proves himself capable of both moral thought and resolute action; he also shows himself incapable of follow-through.  This moral lassitude condemns Danny to the ranks of second-rate individuals.  Indeed, the two people he directly involves in his moral conundrums emerge as more admirable people, yet Perrotta has made them secondary to his protagonist.<br />In a moving epiphany, Danny seems to have gathered sufficient moral courage to commit himself to his New Jersey girlfriend, Cindy, whom he has impregnated.  Faced with the possibility of leaving Yale, Danny resolves to become an adult.  &quot;I can do this, I thought.  I didn't have to be Joe College...I could just be myself, my father's son, living out my life in the town where I was born...I could accept the world I'd unknowingly volunteered for thenight I started a new life in Cindy, learn to be content...&quot;  How refreshingly different &quot;Joe College&quot; would have been had the author chosen to permit Danny to live up to his responsibilities.<br />Instead, Perrotta permits Danny to return to his beloved and beer-bathed Yale, where Danny has come to enjoy the life of academic frivolity, arcane arguements, frustrated sexuality and general dorm idiocy.  Readers from less than affluent circumstances will not be enamored with Danny's problems at Yale; even more frustrating is how conveniently he seems to slip through the cracks of accountablity and how easily even his ventures into moral respectability dissolve, awash in a laissez faire attitude.  Even a courageous confrontation with a group of thugs (the Lunch Monsters, a mob front bent on monopolizing the lunch trade) is but a one-afternoon stand, sound and fury signifying nothing.<br />Thus, despite the enormously entertaining descriptions of early '80s life in Yale and the painstaking accurate descriptions of the different world of the Yalies and the &quot;townies,&quot; Perrotta's novel lacks the very ingredient which eluded its intent:  integrity.  Danny symbolically represents the flaws of the novel, its delicious froth but insubstantial core.  Read &quot;Joe College&quot; for its atmosphere; little else emerges.	2001-12-06
US	50747195	R2Z07KH3TFBVUU	0141002077	232409532	Cherry	Books	5	10	11	N	N	iconoclastic, defiant and gritty teen discerns true self	Both the cover and title of Mary Karr's second memoir, &quot;Cherry,&quot; are deceptive.  Although her scathingly witty and powerfully realized descriptions of coming-of-age in the environmentally and spiritually polluted town of Leechfield, Texas, during the late 1960s and early 70s treat her sexual awakening, her memoir is much more a sarcastic, self-deprecating, but liberating analysis of how Mary came to understand her essence.  Her knowledge of what she would come to refer to as her &quot;Same Self&quot; is hard earned, the author having travelled through the seas of family dysfunction, alienation and rejection of her social mileu, and a bizarre and frightening absorbtion into the drug-culture and the nascent counterculture of her adolescence.  Ms. Karr is an exquisite writer; the compelling narrative of her life augments the marvelous capturing of Texan patois and the absolutely captivating characterizations she renders of the men, women and children who help provide defintion to her life.<br />Now a professor of English at Syracuse University, Mary Karr was a hellion as a child and a rebel as a teenager.  Resentful of the restrictions imposed upon her by a town dedicated to spewing toxic waste into the atmosphere and reared by an alcoholic father and a desperately brilliant but fiercely independent mother, Mary  determines not to follow the footsteps of her voluptuous (and right wing) older sister.  At eleven, envious of her boyfriends' freedom and captivated by her initial sexual stirrings towards one of them, Mary determines to ride her bike bare-chested.  This foray into inarticulated feminist rebellion backfires, of course; the humiliated Mary retreats into her home, bewildered by her mother's bland acquiesence and determined even more to find her place in the world.  Her eventual understanding of her place as a woman  --  of its power, its fragility and its vulnerability --  evolves in a powerful and frightening description of an aborted sexual assualton her mother.<br />That place would not be in school. Some of the memoir's best writing captures the tumultuous years Mary survived high school.   A self-described screw-up, Mary constantly challenged authorities, ridiculing their perceived stupidity and rigidity, wantonly defying traditional convention and eagerly embracing a personality which glorified lassitude, disenchantment and disengagement.  Her eventual involvement (perhaps devolution into) with the world of drugs causes her to remember many events in a fragmented, near kaleidescopic manner.  Although a bit repetitious at times, her colorful, caustic and critical analaysis of the impact of drugs on her consciousness remind the reader of how much this young woman actually forced upon herself in her quest for self understanding.<br />The brutal truth is that Mary Karr was lucky to escape Leechfield.  &quot;The slope of boredom there is steep enough to cast the shadow of an astonishingly high suicide rate.&quot;  Despite the &quot;crushing tedium&quot; of life, this profoundly brilliant, angry, ironic and self-deprecating poet found not only courage, but voice.  It is this unbridled tension and strength that gives &quot;Cherry&quot; its power.  Its author is neither seeking approval nor indictment; she is merely attempting to demonstrate that the explosive impact of her environment did not destroy her.  Indeed, it is that defiant, open-faced grit that gives &quot;Cherry&quot; its capacity to instruct.	2001-11-29
US	50747195	RGGGGAJWJXNTQ	0679456295	228929474	Recent History	Books	5	2	2	N	N	sensitive analysis of sexuality's impact on family life	Anthony Giardina's finely nuanced and emotionally-charged novel &quot;Recent History&quot; is much more than a stirring account of a young man's coming to grips with his father's homosexuality.  This evoctive and intellectually sophisticated work entices the reader to reflect on the nature of knowledge, the limiting and liberating aspects of sexuality, the perils of detachment and fear.  Giardina treats his themes with subtlety, his characters with compassion and his narrative with integrity.  &quot;Recent History&quot; compels its audience to identify not only with the people who populate its pages, but with the demanding questions its author demands we consider as we struggle with the protagonist's quest for self-discovery and authenticity.<br />Luca Carcera, twelve years old in 1962, confronts his father's homosexuality in with a combination of denial and confusion.  A sensitive single child whose shattered sense of family stability induces the development of dispassionate observation, Luca's withdrawl from initmate relationships coincides with his wondering about the limits of knowledge.  Indeed, one of the central ironies about the novel is its title; as an adult, Luca becomes a history teacher who repeatedly notes that history is little more than guesswork.  Knowledge to Luca, therefore, is permeated with relativity.  As a shaken youngster, Luca senses &quot;there was a power to standing outside, to knowing things about people they didn't know you knew.&quot;<br />Knowledge, however, is false armor for Luca.  Angry and frightened, Luca determines that &quot;the way to get back&quot; at his father &quot;was to fall from perfection, to fall as far as I could.&quot;  Convinced that if he were to engage in homosexual behavior, Luca would so anger and shock his father that the latter would recant his abandonment of family and return to a more normal life.  Luca believes in &quot;an order, even one that rendered us the losers;&quot; he assumes the responsibiility ofrecreation of family life, even at the expense of his own sexuality, his own identity.<br />This confusion renders Luca's adult life a shambles.  Are Luca's adolescent homosexual activities indicative of genuine homosexuality or comprehensive sexuality?  Why do Luca's adult relationships bring fear, even terror, instead of fulfillment and joy?  Can Luca ever establish his own sexual identity, apart from his father's and independently validated by his own emotional needs?  As Luca thrashes about for answers, the reader agonizes with him.<br />Anthony Giardina provides no simplistic solutions or nicely-packaged bromides in this taut novel.  Instead, a thorough exploration of male sexuality, its impact on one man's personality and its manifestations on the various families he inhabits during his adult life are the complex themes Giardina deftly explores.  &quot;Recent History&quot; is a challenging, textured and compelling novel.  It richly deserves the critical praise it has earned.	2001-11-15
US	50747195	R2397EPIEEGT5	0743403754	393588679	Around Again	Books	5	11	11	N	N	insightful, compassionate view of a woman's hope for rebirth	Accomplished New England author Suzanne Strempek Shea's most recent novel, &quot;Around Again,&quot; presents convicing and evocative evidence that of life's most significant battles, the wars we wage inside ourselves are the most important.  The novel features a conflicted protagonist, Robyn Panek, who must return to a family farm which, some twenty years earlier, produced a summer that sundered her attachment to an innocent and hopeful past.  Priding herself on her ability to discern that which is real from that which is fake, Robyn must confront not only the unfulfilled status of her present life, but also the traumatizing memories of events which shattered not only friendship and romance, but the very idea of family continuity and personal grace.<br />&quot;Around Again&quot; is a significant departure for the author, whose three previous books possessed an aura of kindness and warmth for the female protagonists whose Polish identity provided nurturing support against life's disappointments.  In this talented and provocative novel, Shea depicts a protagonist whose middle-aged existence is one of loneliness, silent anguish, and subdued frustration over past betrayal.  Robyn Panek emerges as a fully-rendered character, whose hurt and isolation compel our compassion, whose blasted hopes foster our admiration for her earnest determination to make sense of her past.  This is a more somber, sophisticated and adult novel, rich in characterization and deftly presented in a series of cross-cutting chapters which alternate between Robyn as a late adolescent and as a middle-aged woman. <br />Robyn Panek, responding to her uncle's request to close down his beloved family farm in western Massachusetts after he has suffered a near-fatal illness, learns that life does not work out &quot;neat and clean and tidy.&quot;  A central metaphor of the novel revolves around the future of a set of ponies, whose backs have carried decades of riders and whose being is central to Robyn's memory of the past and her self-definition today.  She must confront the memory of Lucy Dragon, whose suicidal impulses some twenty years ago led to the explosion of all that Robyn held dear.  The reflective Robyn comes to realize that &quot;what happens to people between there and here you can never really know.&quot;<br />Suzanne Strempek Shea movingly depicts adolescent friendship through Lucy and Robyn.  Reluctantly, slowly, unknowingly, Robyn comes to love Lucy.  &quot;The flight and exposition, the self-love and automatic hate...all this shone back at me...So there was no way I could miss or ignore the truth.   That looking at this crazy girl, clearly I was also seeing myself.&quot;  The relationship between Robyn and Frankie, her first love, brims with unabashed optimism; how Robyn deals with its abrupt transformation perhaps is the single strongest aspect of the novel.<br />This important work, symbolically rich and engrossing in both its narrative and characterizations, signals a new path for its author.  Rightfully heralded as a vibrant voice for Polish Americans and a keen interpreter of the mind of young women bordering on self-discovery, Suzanne Strempek Shea now can be perceived as an author whose scope is much, much broader.  &quot;Around Again&quot; helps all of us understand what it means to be human.	2001-11-04

Call it the Coalwood way, label it steadfastness of purpose, name it resolute adherence to hard work and internal discipline  --  whatever words you wish to describe the genuine virtues of Homer Hickam, your commentary will not miss the mark.  &quot;Sky of Stone,&quot; the third installment of Hickam's memoirs, is a brilliant book; its vibrant pages remind us of the galvanizing power of individual excellence and of how common people, striving to live coherent and decent lives, serve as genuine role models for a national community that cherishes the notion of individual responsibility, hard work, and shared moral values.<br />&quot;Sky of Stone&quot; chronicles Homer Hickam's summer of 1961, one year after his graduation from high school and light years away from the gloriously innocent time of his adolesence, celebrated in &quot;October Sky.&quot;  This volume is a more somber, questioning memoir; it presents to us a terribly conflicted Homer, worried about his floundering studies at Virginia Tech, tormented about the apparent disintegration of his parents' marriage, and adrift in his own life, undertain as to how he will attain his goal of helping put humans on the moon.  Hopes for spending the summer on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean flounder when his mother orders him to return to Coalwood to provide assistance to his father, who is embroiled in an investigation which could cost him his job.<br />Hickam despairs over his non-relationship with his father; the elder's brooding silence and unwillingness to present a self-defense as the coal company seeks a scapegoat for the death of a respected foreman compels the son to conduct his own search for the truth.  This quest for truth reveals a different side of Coalwood, a community so aligned with itsself-definition that it refuses to divulge secrets which could exculpate the very man on whose shoulders the future of the town rests.  As the youthful Homer comes closer to an understanding of his father and the town, his father becomes even more remote, more removed.<br />It is this tone of emotional anguish that colors the entire memoir.  As Homer becomes a man, he learns adult lessons:  that truth often is as painful as it is liberating, that marriages have profound valleys, that honor and justice have enormous costs.  He learns the significance of loyalty  --  to one's job, to one's peers, to one's community, to one's word.  Through backbreaking labor in the mine, Homer comes to grips with his father's devotion to coal and painfully accepts the consequences of this wisdom.<br />Yet, &quot;Sky of Stone&quot; is far from a melancholy work.  The bittersweet pangs of love rival the glories of hard work and relationships nurtured by sweat, toil and common vision.  Simple, unalloyed decency courses through the pages of &quot;Sky of Stone;&quot; the reader marvels at the simple honor the men and women of Coalwood exercise as they live their lives.  Hickam's self-deprecatory sense of humor, so vivid in both &quot;October Sky&quot; and &quot;The Coalwood Way,&quot; is, if you can believe it, even sharper in &quot;Sky of Stone.&quot;<br />As this memoir reaches its conclusion, and as Homer evolves into manhood, the reader has grown as well.  The pages of this lovingly-written book instruct, even as the narrative's consuming power absorbs our attention.  Hickam's life and his careful, persuasive scrutiny of it gently teach us about those American virtues which, if properly duplicated, will insure our national greatness.  This memoir is one to be cherished, and its author is truly a national treasure.	2001-10-25

Suffused with feminist sensitivity and a clear picture of the significance of initmacy women seem to attain only with and through each other, &quot;The Kind of Love&quot; chronicles a tumultuous year in the life of its protagonist Sarah Strickland, who must confront the shocking and unexpected death of her beloved husband and the enormous phsyical and emotional challenges presented to her through her pregnancy with the child her husband will never expeience.<br />Written as a series of journal entires/letters to her yet unborn child, the novel limps through its first third and does not attain its true stature until the protagonist confronts the very issue to which she introduces the reader in her moving prologue.  In the novel's second paragraph, Sarah admonishes us that &quot;every person's journey is touched by loss...Grief will reach in and wrap its roots tightly around your heart.&quot;  The novel's central premise is presented in the next paragraph:  &quot;What I know now and so desperately want you to understand is that the grief that comes from losing someone does not have to be an ending.  As with most experiences in life, you have a choice.&quot;  <br />One the author has introduced the cruel and abrupt removal of Sarah's husband, however, her characters become truly alive to each other.  &quot;The Kind of Love&quot; is no pat treatment of either the grieving process or the impact of pregnancy on a suddenly-single mother.  Sarah Strickland pours out her heart to her yet unborn child; her uncertainties, ambivalences, fears and anger resonate with authenticity.  Her lifelong friendship with Calista strains and nearly buckles under the stresses of Sarah's newly-minted anguish.  Though the reader yearns for reassurance thatthe honorable protagonist will prevail  --  that life will reassert itself in all its wonder, possibility and frustration  --  the author never bends to convenience in her resolution of Sarah's life.<br />Splendid characterizations abound in this slim, immensely readable novel.  Not only does Sarah come to unknowingly represent the verities of the heart she so valiantly struggles to comprehend, her friendships with Sarah and the stranger, Julie, seem real and genuine.  Since the entire novel is written as a series of journal entries, readers should not expect soaring eloquence on every page.  Sarah's decisions and actions speak far more convincingly that her words.<br />Nevertheless, Ms. Yurk has provided her audience with ample evidence that both she and her imagined protagonist are living with an informed heart.  Against our wishes, we are compelled to acknowledge the &quot;wonder of pain,&quot; but through that pain comes a renewed possibility of love.  Indeed, the love that Sarah discovers for her unborn child is so fierce, so consuming, that it acts as a transformative influence in her wanderings through the barren recesses of grief.  It is a love so deep, so thorough, so cleansing, that it becomes the kind of love that saves you.	2001-10-18

Through realistic dialogue and acutely perceptive descriptions of the external environment and internal psychologies of the Chambers family, the author gracefully transforms our understanding of this &quot;normal&quot; family into one of deep appreciation and genuine compassion.  &quot;A Good Home&quot; signals the introduction of a novelist who understands the ability of literature of inspire both appreciation of the art of writing and respect for the value of an examined life.<br />Burnard introduces us to characters who constantly struggle, grappling with either physical deformities or emotional bruises.  Her characters are not tidy people, and the messes they make with their lives invariably embroil those they love.   Once enmeshed with the compromises and tensions of family members, the characters yearn for coherence, not only in the family structure, but within their own selves.  The members of the Chambers family, usually honorable and steadfast in their quest for integrity, nevertheless watch as dreams crumble, loves wane and children reach eleswhere for understanding and acceptance.  The bruises and imperfections each member of the clan possesses ironically make them more perfect in the eyes of the reader.<br />This sense of believability, therefore, is the single greatest strength of this spacious, nearly-panoramic novel.  The father, Bill, whose hand suffered permanent disfigurement during World War II, strives his entire life to create stability and permanence; he is rewarded with the premature death of his wife, Sylvia and the unexpected emergence of a truly admirable woman, Margaret, who becomes his second wife.  The children, Paul, Patrick and Daphne, struggle mightily with the issues of identity, acceptance and marriage; their results aremixed and surprisingly different.  Throughout, Ms. Burnard provides intricately detailed descriptions of home life, anchoring not only her characters, but her readers as well, in the sense of home which pervades her novel.<br />My only reservation with &quot;A Good House&quot; is its crowded nature.  Like any home built for a nuclear family which unexpectedly is required to shelter more people than its initial design intended, the novel simply has too many people swimming through its layered plot.  By the time Bill has become a great-grandfather, the reader almost needs a score-card to know who belongs to whom and how each is related to the other.  Excessive numbers of chracters dulls rather than shines light on the themes and often diverts attention from the otherwise strong plot line.<br />Despite this minor irritant, &quot;A Good House&quot; is a wonderful, compelling exploration of the manifest dynamism and unexpected turmoil a truly vibrant family must encounter.	2001-10-13
US	50747195	R2F2LPVPL8Y9FS	0312147015	253392869	The Persian Pickle Club	Books	3	18	21	N	N	Depression-era Kansas women honor friendship via quilting	Suffused with tender compassion for common women, &quot;The Persian Pickle Club&quot; celebrates the quiet strength and genuine decency Depression-era women generated for and with each other.  Set in the rural backwaters of Harveyville, Kansas, Sandra Dallas' novel deftly interweaves a fascinating set of dynamics:  a women's quilting club and an unsolved homicide.  The Persian Pickle Club provides a haven for overworked and Depression-stunned farm women; their quilts represent the tenacity of friendship, the endurance of community, and the prevalence of beauty in a part of the country that suffers terribly from economic want.  The unsolved homicide permits the author to introduce a citified &quot;outsider&quot; to the club; her defiant eccentricities endear her to the friendship-starved protagonist, Queenie Bean, and alienate her from the stodgy regularity of other club members.  The unsolved homicide tests the limits of community and drives both the protagonist and her newfound friend, Rita, to discover the truth to the case and the depths of their relationship.<br />Sandra Dallas is at her best in her evocative descriptions of the impact of the Great Depression on what was once a cohesive, optimistic community.  The certainties of rural life begin to dissolve as unemployed drifters regularly appear on the fringes of community life.  Queenie's big-hearted husband, Grover, slowly emerges as the conscience of the novel, welcoming those down-and-outers with sensitivity and honorable charity.  The author's characterizations of the Joe Blue Massie family, a destitute quartet who come to share the land with Queenie and Grover, ring with authenticity.  Ms. Dallas also treats the issues of community conscience, social responsibility, female frustration and shared destiny with considerable dignity.<br />Ironically, it is the actual descriptions of the quility club which ring somewhat hollow.  What should have been the strength of the novel and that which other reviewers have praised appeared to be the weakest aspect of &quot;The Pesian Pickle Club.&quot;  The ensemble of women who gathered weekly never seemed to gain much dimension.  Readers may well find themselves aswirl in a sea of characters, all of whom are decent enough, but most of whom lack depth and complexity.  To borrow a metaphor from the novel, the stitching of the characters is clumsy and amateurish.  Given the power and sophistication of Dallas' treatment of theme and setting, this flaw is all the more noticeable.<br />Gracefully written and driven by a fascinating friendship between the polarities of city-county, naivete-sophistication, &quot;The Persian Pickle Club&quot; is a capable novel.  It simply lacks depth in characterization, and that flaw retards the novel from attaining its honorable goal of not only lauding female friendship, but fully explaining it.	2001-10-03

Despite the highly unusual occurrence of having the accused be a devout member of the Amish community, the novel scarcely scratches beneath the surface of the important issues it pretends to analyze.  Unidimensional characters respond with unerring predictability; the keen, compassionate insights Ms. Picoult demonstrated in &quot;The Pact&quot; give way to cliched dialogue and monochromatic characterizations in &quot;Plain Truth.&quot;  <br />The author seems either to muddy or simplify practically every significant theme or conflict in the novel.  Characterizations border on stereotypes with distressing regularity.  Her portrait of the Fisher household, a seemingly model Amish family, conveniently contains a stern, silent and orthodox father, a banished intellectual son, a repressed but demurely defiant wife, and a conflicted but angelic daughter who happens to hide her pregnancy, give noiseless birth in a barn and remonstrate that she has no knowledge of that fact even when she is confronted with the fact that her infant son is later discovered dead within hours of his birth.  The urbane, career-consumed and conveniently unmarried and childless defense lawyer, Ellie Hathaway, discovers not only the truth of the case but how sterile her life is without love.  The love interests in the novel, and they abound, are cookie-cutter models of whatever virtue or vice the author deems necessary for moving the plot.<br />Jodi Picoult should know better.  Her other works are masterful treatments of the ambiguities of faith and the terribly complicated world of the courtroom when murder is the charge.  Ms. Picoult has an abiding faith in the human condition, and her previous novels encourage readers to share in that optimism, but only after an ordeal, whether it be in faith, knowledge, or the law, has been surmounted.  In earlier novels, shecreated marvelous characters whose humanity was tested by wrongful accusation or psychological torment.  The plain truth about &quot;Plain Truth&quot; is that it is a false novel  --   cloying, saccharine and manipulative.	2001-09-28
US	50747195	R283DFS6WGWTCV	0446526932	198486217	The Curing Season	Books	5	4	4	N	N	brilliant, harrowing and haunting tale of domestic violence	Leslie Wells' debut novel, &quot;The Curing Season,&quot; may be one of the most upsetting and important books you will ever read.  Brilliantly conceived, this harrowing novel flays the reader's sensibilities as it unblinkingly reveals the hellish and horrific nature of domestic abuse in grim, evocative and devastating detail.  Embedded in this vital book are lessons on endurance, wrenching avowals of the depth of love a mother has for a child and stirring portraits of heroic risks friends quietly, but unhesitatingly, take for each other.  Written with feminist sensitivity and a sense of outrage against violence against women, &quot;The Curing Season&quot; will surely be recognized as a classic in its genre, favorably compared with Dorothy Allison's &quot;Bastard out of Carolina.&quot;<br />Haunting contemporary questions permeate the novel, set in rural Virginia some fifty years ago.  Where can abused and battered women turn when &quot;the right to hit your woman is sacred...right up there with the liberty to clobber your kids&quot;?  How can an individual woman, beaten into submission and gradually losing hope, solve an equation where shame, fear and remorse equal degradation?  Under what circumstances can one woman, watching her life crumble away and her personality dissolve, gain the strength of reclaim her identity?<br />One of the truly noble qualities of &quot;The Curing Season&quot; is its introduction of its protagonist, Cora Slaughter Melville, one of the more remarkable characters in recent American literature.  Wells invests Cora with extraordinary resolve and indominable dignity, attributes upon which she must call  to overcome circumstances which would conmpel others to consideration of suicide.  Born into rural poverty, afflicted physically with a clubfoot and spiritually with an abusive alcoholic father, Cora Slaughter has learned both to accept her life's circumstances and to identify with the sufferings of others.  This empathy encompasses all beings who have unfairly suffered or who are marginalized by a society reeking with prejudice and ignorance.  She forgives her mother's passivity and receives solace from her wise and strong older sister, Sibby.<br />&quot;The Curing Season&quot; dissects the cycle of domestic violence through the events which befall Cora.  Her physical deformity, a clubfoot &quot;like a glutted sluggish earthworm curled in upon itself,&quot; becomes a terrifying metaphor for the stunted, blasted life opening up before her during her late teen years.  A drifter's overtures appear heaven-sent, truly miraculous.  Cora's eventual debasement shimmers in intensity between physical and psychological ruin.<br />In her review of the novel, Nikki Giovanni tells readers that &quot;The Curing Season&quot; reminds us about the necessity of standing up to evil.  It is this lesson that Leslie Wells enshrines in her novel.  Cora Slaughter's condition  --  a beaten, devastated woman  --  is all the more hurtful because it did not occur in a vacuum.  The evil of domestic violence was accepted and ritualized by too many men in her time; her victimization did not elicit outcries of conscience on her behalf.  It was on the shoulders of Cora Slaughter, alone, on which the weight of evil rested.  Leslie Wells' desperately moving novel implores all of us to gain the vision, dignity and courage to denounce social evil and eliminate it from our midst.	2001-09-20

Reiken is simply masterful in making us care for his characters; ultimately, they assume near-legendary, mythical stature despite (or perhaps because of) their suburban, late twentieth-century New Jersey environment.<br />The novel's perspective varies through the different voices of the characters; thus, &quot;The Lost Legends&quot; initially appears as a series of interlocking short stories. On a different level, however, &quot;The Lost Legends&quot; grows in intensity as it plumbs the questions of love, loss and personal meaning through the experiences and voices of several key characters. All, however, share a foreboding sense of loss, best articulated by the protagnoist's grandfather: &quot;Life will have woods and it will always have tenebrium [darkness]...And this is it. You look for clearings. This is what life is all about. And when they come you stay inside for as long as possible. You look for openings and clearings, in your life.&quot;<br />The protagonist, Anthony Rubin, exemplifieds this search for spiritual freedom and completion. Left reeling by the ruin of his parents' marriage and his mother's personal disintegration, Anthony must discover the means to break through his numbness in order to learn about the possibility of love. This is achieved through his staggeringly beautiful, but hardened neighbor, Juliette Dimiglio. Her character is etched pefectly by Reiken; Juliette's psychological scars cannot overtake her physical perfection, and her sense of detachment (bornthrough her mother's suicide and an eerily masochistic relationship with her boyfriend) begins to melt only through a wonderous encounter with Anthony. Anthony's father, Michael, comes to symbolize both the deadening realities and endless possibilities of middle-age. His divorce leads to existential loneliness and a renewed belief in the existence of a b'shert, that one special person who completes and fulfills the other.<br />It is this hope of love, of completion, of achieving grace which elevates this special novel. Each of the central characters attempts to awaken him or herself; each sloughs off the deadening qualities of sterile relationships and hopeless despair and searches for authenticity. This search for perfection, amidst sterility, sadness, destruction and despair, presents the stuff of legends. Anthony, himself, articulates this sense as he attempts to explain the phenomena of his life in a legendary paradigm. &quot;He didn't understand why he did this, because New Jersey was not legend. It was the armpit of America, according to most people. Still he saw everything around him as legend.&quot;<br />By novel's end, Frederick Reiken has given us reason to believe as well.	2001-09-17

Devoto's focus on the onset of the civil rights movement, as witnessed through the lives of poor, rural Southerners, Black and white, described the turmoil of racial injustice, class friction and personal autonomy in a compelling narrative voice.  Her second novel, &quot;Out of the Night that Covers Me&quot; is an exceptional work, one written with rare compassion, special insight into the eternal struggle for personal integrity, and convincing accuracy about the impact of racism on the lives of members of an isolated rural Southern community.  The novel has been favorably compared to &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and deserves that praise.<br />Spindly John McMillan, whose secure, urbane life with his widowed mohter abruptly ends with her premature death, emerges as one of the most beloved youthful protagonists of Southern literature.  Suffused with a quiet suffering, he comes to live with his repressed and avaricious Aunt Nelda and her brutally vicious husband, Luther.  Devoto spares little detail as she describes John's descent into the hellishly collapsed environment of his new sharecropping home.  Ignorant, bound by poverty and tradition, and hopeless, the Spraig family is the antithesis of what he has envisioned for his life.  That sudden reversal of fortune, the agonizing realization that brutality and stunted aspirations will be his lot in life create an enormous empathy for the protagnoist.  <br />Although brilliant characterizations abound in &quot;Out of the Night,&quot; the novel gains its power from a narrative that grabs the reader and refuses to relinquish its grasp until the inexorable and terrifying conclusion permits the reader to understand the path John will lead in his adult life.John's quest for understanding  --  his life, his new family, his relationship with African-Americans  --  and his absolute strength in confronting pain, humiliation and injustice receive comprehensive   scrutiny.  <br />Readers will also be impressed by the author's subtle use of symbolism.  Each of the most admirable characters in &quot;Out of the Night&quot; are physically or emotionally flawed; yet it is the very disfiguration which presentes each character with unique beauty and dignity.  The Judge, a solitary compassionate white man whose vision of racial degradation forces him to treat African-Americans with financial dignity in his role as a bank chairman, is blind.  Tuway, an African-American whose unique skin coloration has led to his ability to bridge disparate worlds, overcomes ostracism to emerge as a genuine leader.  John, whose skin literally falls off his body after his grisly initiation into the life of a sharecropper, toughens his body but opens his soul to the possibility (and only a possibility) of racial amity.<br />The reputation of Pat Cunningham Devoto will grow as she crafts more novels which treat the crucial issues of racial justice and personal self-determination.  &quot;Out of the Night that Covers Me&quot; should become one of our national literary staples, a book which, when read by families or shared in classrooms, will become one of those shared experiences which illuminate and educate.	2001-09-02

Its subtitle, &quot;Claiming the Songs of My Fathers,&quot; more accurately captures the sense of conflict and struggle which permeates the life of a talented, tormented and frustrated young woman, who at once soars with the rich musical background of both her father and grandfather but simultaneously is denied participation and validation because of her gender. &quot;A Joyful Noise&quot; elicits both compassion and anger from the reader; one senses that had the author been born some twenty years later she would have had much more direct access to both her own talents and her clearly-articulated love for her heritage. The author does not disguise the central theme of her memoir. After a disappointing experience at a Passover seder, Deborah expresses her yearning to join her father and grandfather as full participants in both music and heritage. &quot;I hummed the songs as quietly as I could, aching to get them right, afraid that my father would hear my wrong notes and correct me. They ran perfectly through my head but not from my mouth. I loved them. I wanted them.&quot; Yet, she understands that her ambition does not correspond with the very heritage she so deeply desires. Segregated, minimized and isolated due to sexist traditions and practices, Jewish women have had to sublimate their otherwise honorable ambitions into other avenues of expression. Sensing that possibility, even as a child, Deborah laments: &quot;My desire was as strong as theirs; my voice was not. My breath stalled against my vocal cords, and the back of my throat throbbed from stopped-up songs and angry tears. I wanted to sing. I wanted to be heard.&quot; Weisgall's quest for authenticity, for voice, occurs during a period of national affluence and cultural indifference in the 1950s and on the cusp of our nation's profound social revolution of the 1960s. Deborah comes of age in a tension-riddled family; her non-religious mother, Nathalie, is indifferent to housework, and her beloved father, Hugo, consistently produces operas which are artistically gifted but critical failures. The Weisgalls constantly move from their Baltimore roots, whether it be to Maine for summers, or from college town to another, where Hugo can sustain his family's material needs while he tries to fulfill his own battered expectations as an artist. Deborah realizes the discored in her family is real; her mother's physical beauty cannot hide her bitterness just as her father's rapture with musci cannot hide his own frustration with failure and betrayal. Looming like a dense cloud over the family is the Holocaust, whose disruptive horror has created a permanent sense of dread and loss. In a desultory search through her parents' closet, Deborah discovers a shoe-box stuffed with raw and brutal photographs of cocentration camp victims. She understands in a visceral sense the impact of genocide on her father, who directly witnessed the horrific scenes while he served as a translator for the liberating United States Army during World War II. The Weisgalls are derivative survivors, having lost their past, their roots, their culture through the Holocaust. The author is able to trace the genesis of family friction to this loss of place. Nathalie, a lover of beauty, flounders in America; Hugo, linked in memory to his childhood in Czechoslovakia, wrestles with his own struggle to match his father (Abba) without the support of cultural stability and identity. The memoir is not without its faults. Unless one has a solid grasp of opera and classical music, Weisgall's detailed descriptions of her artistic passion tend to overwhelm the reader. Deborah's ultimately successful climb to identity occurs too abruptly, as well. Her ultimate chapters, which recount her experiences as Radcliffe and her emergence as an independent, secure woman, appear rushed and lack the elegant detail so prevalent throughout descriptions of her childhood. Nevertheless, this serious and introspective work deserves the critical praise it has garnered. &quot;A Joyful Noise&quot; deftly interweaves music, religious heritage and family into a tapestry both instructive and inspiring.	2001-08-25

Not only is the novel addictively engrossing, it is wicked in its treatment of the most hallowed icon of the South - womanhood.  This saucy, delectable morality tale vigorously tackles issues of friendship, betrayal, honor and revenge.  In addition, &quot;Eating&quot; explores the nature of mother-daughter relationships with a jaundiced eye; two of the three mother figures live voracious vicarious lives through their daughters.  Ellis seems to have managed to craft a novel whose narrative drive is authentic, whose characters are absolutely compelling and whose writing is clean, brisk and vivid.  <br />The setting of the novel is Tuscaloosa, Alabama, seemingly a bizarre universe in and of itself.  Housing the University of Alabama, the city seethes with the machinations of sorority mothers and daughters; some of the best writing of the book treats the arcane (and, to me, idiotic) behaviors expected of Greeks in the univesity social scene.  Ellis' penchant for satire is at its best here, though she never forfeits her characters' authenticity for cheap laughs.  Indeed, the tormented Nicole's descent into madness is made all the more horrifying given the acquiesence and encouragement of those closest to her, especially her mother, whose own demons ultimately consume her.  The demonic Sarina Summers emerges as a fully-fleshed villain.  Not only is she manipulative and cruel, her beauty beguiles and corrupts as her cunning quest for social porminence blithely dismisses those who would challenge her.  Bitty Jack, the erstwhile heroine of the novel, confronts class prejudice, social ostracism and the poisonous impact of false accusation and battles mightily for personal vindication.<br />One could read &quot;Eating&quot; however for only its delicious metaphors.  Early on, Sarina boasts of her precocious sexuality.  &quot;Sarina walked like a young lady who had spent some time at second base.  She stuck out her chest as if to show the cleat marks.&quot;  When Ellis describes the atmosphere near the stadium at the University of Alabama's Homecoming, she informs us that &quot;the smell of Jimmy Dean sausage filled the air like napalm.&quot;  It is clear that the author enjoyed her labors.<br />&quot;Eating the Cheshire Cat&quot; is not for the timid, however.  Human viciousness appears throughout the book; even parents torment and mutilate their children, physically and emotionally.  Yet, the author never lets us forget that cruelty must be met head-on.  When Bitty Jack is tempted to flee Tuscaloosa, she realizes that she would be haunted forever by the &quot;wake of...destruction&quot; left by her tormentor.  Helen Ellis takes on &quot;mean women&quot; in this marvelous, wickedly delightful novel.	2001-08-20

The protagonist,  blue-collared and illegitimate, struggles against a stifling home life, social prejudices and economic privation and yearns to know her true self.  Rhonda is as compelling as Huck Finn and as dynamic as Ellen Foster; the author, Norma Peterson, permits the narrative of the story to speak for itself.  Rhonda cascades through a myriad of struggles and darkly humorous life choices, and Peterson permits her heroine to voice her misgivings, doubts and hopes with a voice that is at once forceful and fearful.  Set in western Pennsylvania at the end of World War II, the novel features women on the cusp of feminist awareness but acutely aware of, and, at times uncomfortable with, their upcoming roles in post-war America.  This engaging work, however, comes with its own sadness; the author died shortly before publication of this, her only novel.  That Pererson's voice is stilled is a loss to American literature.<br />Rhonda Sayers, by the time she will have turned sixteen, will have faced some of the most severe challenges a poor, frustrated and rebellious young woman could possibly face.  Living with a simplistic mother, whose physical beauty only partly masks an incredible simplistic docility, Rhonda's nascent intellectualism compels her drive for independence.  Wracked with guilt  --  about not having a father, about not looking like a Sayers woman, about the evil thoughts she harbors about her mother  --  Rhonda's internal conflicts compel her to seek to escape the suffocating life facing her.  <br />Ostracized by a rigidly conformist and repressive culture (Peterson brilliantly recreates the stigma attached to \\"bastard\\" children), Rhonda seeks refuge in words.  She writes mordant poetry and memorizes pithy quotations she adroitly uses to extricate herself from uncomfortable situations.  When her mother, recognized as the town [tramp], takes up with a club-footed carney named Eddie, Rhonda gains insight into the true deformity of her life.  Eddie attempts to exploit Rhonda's natural physical flexibility by auditioning her as a sideshow \\"rubber woman.\\"  This abortive attempt only fuels Rhonda's need to become her own person; her appetite whetted by possibility, she leaves her small hometown for Philadelphia.  The big city opens up new possibilities for her; Rhonda befriends bohemians, who ply her with existential quotations and amphetamines.  Never at place with this set of \\"faster\\" friends, Rhonda accepts the advice of one friend and sets out to discover the identity of her father.<br />Norma Peterson handles this quest with humor, insight and compassion.

As the author herself admits, recounting growing up in her tiny (population 300) home town from 1965-1980 posed a most unusual task.  &quot;The distance between Mooreland in 1965 and a city like San Francisco in 1965 is roughly equivalent to the distance starlight must travel before we look up casually from a cornfield and see it.&quot;  Her sister, Melinda, commented that nobody had written a book about Mooreland &quot;because no one sane would be interested  in reading it.&quot;  Yet, Haven &quot;Zippy&quot; Jarvis' childhood  -  one which featured her travelling to hospital emergency rooms so frequently that the nurses knew her by name, one in which she was endlessly fascinated with the skin tone of senior citizens, one in which each citizen of the community contains some quality which transforms the curious, rambunctious and irrepressible child  -- utterly absorbs the reader.  This charming book will gain an enormous popularity precisely because it drives to the heart of what it means to be a child.  <br />Not only does the author recount anecdotes with a voice straight from childhood in America's heartland, Kimmel permits Zippy to describe her own development with uncanny, wry detachment.  We learn how Haven, as a baby, did not speak a word until nearly her third birthday, and when she determined to do so, it was to make a bet with her father.  Her self-portrait of her infancy still tickles me:  &quot;I was bald until I was nearly three.  My head was also strangely crooked...Also my eyes were excessively large and decidedly close together.  When my mother first saw me in the hospital she looked up with tears in her eyes and said to my father, 'I'll love her and protect her anyway.'&quot;  <br />Family and community members of Mooreland are deliciously portrayed.  The overweight Debbie, mother of a friend, &quot;was in the kitchen frying dinner.  Dinner at the Newmans' always,  always involved the Fry Daddy...The food groups as represented by Debbie were:  Fried, Meat, Bread, Coke, and Ice Cream.  She was an excellent cook.&quot;  Her brother, Daniel, of &quot;ramrod-stiff&quot; posture and attitude, refuses to read until a sympathetic high-school teacher suggests he do so; when he recounts the evening's television shows from the &quot;TV Guide,&quot; his tearful mother inquires as to how he has learned.  Danny responds, &quot;Mr. McCutcheon said school would be easier if I learned to read...So I just went ahead and did that.&quot;  <br />Melinda, Zippy's practical, sensitive older sister, is particularly well-drawn.  An especailly evocative episode involves Zippy's introduction to birth defects.  After Zippy observes a severely deformed child, she verbally pesters her older sister &quot;Lindy?  What was wrong with that girl?&quot;.  Melinda, &quot;reached out for my hand, quick to anger and quick to forgive,&quot; and told Zip that the child was born deformed.  Stunned and atypically quiet, Zippy ponders both that reality and the wonder of her older sister; &quot;it was as if Melinda had both answered my question and refused to answer it.  She looked down at me...a still kind of look, like the moment when a seesaw is perfectly straight.&quot;  Her mother, Delonda is a voracious reader and content to allow normal househood chores to finish in second place to her appetite for science fiction.  Yet, when Zippy comes to believe that she was adopted (thinking her real parents were gypsies and that she was born with a tail), her mother tells her she was actually traded for a bottomless green velvet bag, one so special it lacked a bottom.  Zippy delights in thinking that the gypsies lost out on the deal, but her mother steers her gently in the direction of acceptance and understanding when Delonda comments that the bag  &quot;looked just like a normal bag, except that you could just keep putting stuff in it.  It was like the human heart, sweetie:  there was no end to what it could hold.&quot;  Zippy's heart truly belongs to her father, Bob Jarvis, agnostic free-thinker, perpetual gambler and occasional dispenser of wisdom.  Delighted with his scab-ridden, tomboyish daughter, Bob threatens to hold Zippy upside down and &quot;spit on her butt&quot; if she turns out like Melinda.  The Jordans emerge as a coherent, vibrant family, materially poor but rich in the best and most important ways imaginable.<br />When you read &quot;A Girl Named Zippy,&quot; you will learn about a woman who appears to be about &quot;164 years old&quot; whose skin, &quot;impatient for her to get it over with and die, appeared to be sliding down off her body into a pool around her ankles.&quot;  You will also learn why it is all right to love a chicken; after all, &quot;I've seen women passionately devoted to men who couldn't pile bricks...not to mention all those people who curl up at night with dogs that have gunk running out of their eyes, dogs who earlier peed where they were about to walk and spent ten minutes licking their own wormy butts.&quot;<br />Written by a gifted author who truly understands the power of voice, who mixes humorous observations with genuine respect and love for the human condition and who knows how rejoicing in childhood can liberate adult life, &quot;A Girl Named Zippy&quot; will become a national treasure.	2001-08-08
US	50747195	R255WV9KET0X1N	0743202082	886208530	Whompyjawed: A Novel	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Nothing whompyjawed about this terrific h.s. football novel	Written with a unique voice and evocative sense of place, Mitch Cullin's debut novel, &quot;Whompyjawed,&quot; is a complete triumph.  The novel focuses on the inchoate and often inarticulatge yearnings and existential questioning of its protagonist, Willy Keeler, whose prowess in high-school football affords him the opportunity to escape the prospects of a dead-end life in Claude, Texas.  &quot;Whompyjawed&quot; gains its stature from its reliance on the compelling, believable and authentic voice of its protagonist; Willy not only plays a great game on the gridiron, he speaks a great game as well, whether it be through his many internal monologues or external conversations with a series of memorable secondary characters who help compose the texture of his life.  Cullin's memorable description of Claude, once fefined as the &quot;real ass of nowhere,&quot; could well be compared with the atmosphere established in Larry McMurtry's &quot;The Last Picture Show,&quot; Kent Haruf's  &quot;Plainsong&quot; or Larry Watson's &quot;Montana, 1948.&quot;<br />It would be all to easy to caricaturize Willy Keeler's life:  star football player, dates the gorgeous but virginal daughter of a repressive high-school principal, reluctant victim of paternal abandonment, observer of family disintegration, unknowing pawn of his football coach who is simultaneously paternalistic and cynically manipulative.  These truths, however, grossly simplify the complexity and depth of the protagonist's life.  Keeler, despite every inducement to play it safe, constantly questions his actions and tries to invent acceptable understandings of his life's direction.  Football, Texas style, becomes a powerful metaphor of competition, deception and self-definition.  Coach Bud's professed concern for Willy's future unravels under championship pressure; the adult's supposed maturity disintegrates as he blandly risks Willy's health for victory.  Ultimately, Cullin destroys our culture's image of high-schoool football coaches as role models for innocent youth.<br />Willy's increased disaffection with his high-school sweetheart, Hanna, leads to a powerful sexual fantasy and attachment to one of his mother's abused, broken friends.  The author's treatment of adult and adolescent sexuality is one of the novel's special achievements.  As well, Cullin sympathetically examines the multi-faceted and disastrous consequences of a fractured family.  In a manner reminiscent of Sherwood Anderson in &quot;Winesburg, Ohio,&quot; the characters in &quot;Whompyjawed&quot; suddenly and unpredictably become alive to each other, briefly, but powerfully, illuminating their deepest selves to each other.  Willy's mother's brief and pain-saturated soliloquy about her family's past is perhaps the best of many epiphanies streaking  across the novel's pages.<br />Though many of the moments of this novel are whompyjawed askew  --  odd or off-centered  --  the novel rings true.  &quot;Whompyjawed&quot; will remain with the reader long after its conclusion.	2001-08-08
US	50747195	R2XMMLISGV9K1J	0804114609	777164082	Patty Jane's House of Curl	Books	4	3	3	N	N	pleasing melodrama basks in glow of female bonding	Told in a deceptively simple voice, Lorna Landvik's debut novel, &quot;Patty Jane's House of Curl,&quot; is a moving and evocative triumph.  Never deviating from its melodramatic structure, &quot;Curl&quot; successfully blends splendid characterization, trenchant social commentary and compassionate feminist perspective.  Landvik, with humor and conviction, celebrates the tenacity of female connections, the eternal surge of the human heart for love and the galvanizing energy we find in our search for that special person who completes our life.<br />Though hairdresser/abandoned wife Patty Jane Dobbin is the central character in the novel, she gains depth and power through her relationships with the other pivotal women in her life.  Her sister Harriet, enormously talented and resolute in her love for her sister, encounters the zenith and nadir of life and, with subtlety and courage, instructs Patty Jane as to life's meaning.  Ione, Patty Jane's perfectly-presented mother-in-law, whose capacities to create mouth-watering delectables and vocabulary-deflecting malapropisms, serves as a quiet, but sure symbol of the Norwegian influence in this Minneapolis-based novel.  Patty Jane's daughter, Nora, grows up not only the tumultuous 1960s but in a literal den of female friendships  --  a hair salon where women talk and listen to each other.  Readers will rejoice at the four significant men who appear, disappear and reapper in the lives of the Dobbin women.<br />This sensitive, sweet novel does not flinch when treating the vexing issues of male abandonment of families, alocholism and female loneliness.  Landvik's success as an author derives from her love of humanity, her earthy sense of humor and her unflagging belief in the transforming power of love.  She has created a moving, gripping work, that, despite its conventional adherence to melodrama, entices the reader to truly care about the characters who populate her work.	2001-08-08
US	50747195	R22PED2OJE3IYF	0811823555	258473098	Things Unspoken: A Novel	Books	4	7	8	N	N	bereft, headstrong young woman comes of age in icy family	Aptly named, &quot;Things Unspoken,&quot; Anitra Sheen's compelling, enraging and forceful debut novel, examines the consequences of living in a family seemingly without the affirmation of love or belonging.  Written with a powerful voice and tempered by an adult perspective, the novel traces the childhood and early adolescence of Jorie Mackinnon, the admirable protagonist who must not only bear the burden of losing her mother to polio when Jorie ws but four years old, but the even more onerous task of living with a distant, imperious father and two older brothers, both of whom respond to the scars of their mother's death in different manners.  This is a vexing novel, in which the reader is torn between admiration for Jorie's resolve, integrity and (borrowing from a phrase of the secretive underworld figure, The Boss) &quot;moxie,&quot; and outright disgust at her father, a brilliant doctor whose indifference to his own children is masked behind a facade of believing that children growing up independently of their parents is the best way to rear children.<br />Indeed, &quot;Things Unspoken&quot; is the code phrase for this family's operating principles; uncomfortable or unsettling ideas or events simply aren't talked about.  They are talked around or ignored, and the hurts, confusions and dislocations caused by this willed silence seemingly disappear, only to reasser themselves in the destructive behaviors manifested in each of the family members.  Jorie, especially, yearns for verbal interaction and reassurance, for a sense of belonging and love.  Even after her father suffers a heart attack, Jorie remains silent.  &quot;There were so many things I wanted to ask about, things that had always run through our lives in a river of silence  --  my mother, his [first] Chinese wife, his other women, his other children, the connections we didn't know about, the friends we never saw  --  but I didn't dare.&quot;<br />Ms. Sheen boldly adds her voice to a growing national dialogue of what a family is and how a family should function.  Even though &quot;Things Unspoken&quot; is set in Los Angeles during the 1950s, a relatively innocent time in our national experience, the novel has a distinctly contemporary tone.  The three children, deliberately (cruelly?) left to their own devices, mirror latch-key kids today.  The father's distinctive laissez-faire attitude toward children (justified by his own isoltive childhood in a remote Candian prairie) harmonizes with the harried and stressed-out lives of the affluent technocrats of the 1990s.  When Jorie's father proclaims, &quot;I've taken care of my responsibilities.  My life is my own and it's not for you to judge me.  I've never imposed my authority on you.  I've given you the freedom of your own life, so you should understand,&quot; he proudly affirms parentage by absence, paternal responsibility by invisibility and independence through indifference.  This type of parental abdication, dressed up as letting your children find their own way, infuriated me as I read the novel, but it also caused me to hope that the children would find their way, scarred, frightened and silent though they may have been.<br />Thus, &quot;Things Unspoken&quot; is a rare novel.  It combines a wonderful protagonist confronting some of the most cruel and daunting adversaries imaginable:  a father who is indifferent and a family which is only hanging together by a thread.  It is a gritty, harrowing and troubling story, one which leaves the reader impressed both with the author's storytelling ability and consumed with the central questions examined.	2001-08-06

The three Boone children, Clem, Garrett and Samantha, yearn for a normal, invisible childhood.  Instead, they are compelled to confront the invasive abuse of anti-abortion protestors who regularly disrupt their home life out of anger at the childrens' mother, Mercer, who provides abotion services to the blue-collar town of Lukin, Ohio, in addition to serving as a conscientious OB/GYN.  If that weren't enough, the children's unstable father, Kendall, slowly and inexorably slips into insanity.  Thus, the three children never experience the delight of family tranquility or the stablity of relative anonymity.<br />Jaffe's significant talents find best expression when exploring the psychological consequences of growing up in an environment which permits neither ease or coherence.  Despite learning, at an early age, the notion of social responsibility, the children &quot;had rubbed against things too sharp for the hands of the young.  They'd been spittoons for words of terrific cruelty, they'd felt the sting of noses turned bloody.  Awfulness that usually began in defense of things they didn't completely understand:  their mother's work or their father's mind.&quot;<br />In addition, the author skillfully interweaves Mercer's anxieties about the ramifications of her life's work on her children's safety.  &quot;...This is what worried Mercer most:  someday, intelligently, one or more of her children might come to the decision that their mother had placed them all in trouble's way for a belief they did not share.&quot;  Kendall's increased instablity further isolates the Boones from a neighborhood steeped in hypocrisy and isolated anger.  Jaffe's subtle depiction of the Boones' neighbors is superb.  Lukin seethes with intolerance, disdain and fear at the Boones, a family that simply does not fit inwith the truncated hopes of a working-class community.  After Kendall's institutionalization, the neighborhood heaves a sigh of relief, however guiltily, that at least one detriment to community stability has been removed.<br />As the children age, their realizations mature.  Garrett &quot;accepted the parallels in his parents' lives:  one needing protection from others, one needing only protection from himself.&quot;  Not until young adulthood does Clem have a serious conversation with her mother about Mercer's decision to provide abortions, and the mother's measured response is one of the most eloquent defenses of the right to choice imaginable.  &quot;'I'd imagine no one wishes there weren't a need for abortions more than the doctors who perform them...But I can't just hide my eyes and hope it'll disappear.  The only satisfaction - if that's even the word - I can take from doing abortions is knowing I gave the patients the best medical care I was capable of.  A proficient set of hands.'&quot;<br />&quot;Skateaway&quot; is not without its flaws.  Written in three distinctive parts  --  childhood, adolescence and adulthood  --  the novel never fully coheres.  Jaffe also has difficulty with the narrative; constant flashbacks tend to interfere with understanding rather than enchance it.  The writing tends to be uneven as well; some pages have lyrical beauty while others are mundane.  Nevertheless, the strengths of the novel far outweigh the weaknesses.  A devastating conclusion reaffirms the undercurrent of fear swirling in &quot;Skateaway.&quot;  Jaffe poses very troubling questions and does not flinch in attempting to provide thoughtful and compelling answers.  His characters' unique personalities and utterly believable means of responding to their unusual home circumstances elevate the importance of this novel.	2001-07-18

President Reagan provided the verbal apotheosis of this anti-goverrnmental attitude, and his accolyte, George W. Bush, a political insider if there ever was one, continues the cynical and insidious calculated assault on the nature of government and its relationship with the people.  Many Americans today feel a profound alienation from government and truly believe their interests are contradictory of those of government.  T. H. Watkins, author of the elegant, compelling and profound history of the Great Depression, &quot;The Hungry Years&quot; must wince every time he hears these voices.  Professor Watkins knows of another time in our past, one of great social dislocation and mass suffering; one where men and women yearned for work and from work, hope; one where the threads which bound us together as a nation were slowly, but steadily, fraying.  His remarkably beautiful and tremendously affecting work stands as a reminder that there was a time in our not too distant past where one man, crippled and conflicted himself, sought to alleviate that suffering in a program which would redefine a citizen's relationship with his or her national government.<br />&quot;The Hungry Years&quot; above all serves as a philosophical keystone that Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the New Deal sought to change governmental indifference into governmental action, attempted to create a symbiotic and caring relationship between the common person and government, and served to remind all Americans that activism in the name of justice and dignity is a pivotal characteristic in our national character.  Watkins clearly analyzes the myriad of dreams, laws, acts, decisions and outcomes of the New Deal, and he is frank in discussing shortfalls and disappointments.  Underlying the discussion, however, is his unabashed admiration for the tenor of the early years of FDR's adminstration.   &quot;For a time,  millions of Americans   --  white, black, and brown, male and female, urban and rural, young and old, white-collar and blue-collar  --  had been given a sense of their own worth and power, the notion that by joining together they could control at least some portion of their lives, however imperfectly, however briefly.&quot;<br />This admirable volume rings with authenticity, primarily because the author so assiduously assembled anecdotes and interviews with those directly affected by the Great Depression.  Human voices, laden with sadness and anger, ringing with rage at loss and suffering and growling with the ominous timbre of class war, appear on every page.  These voices, magnificently interstitched with careful research (even his footnotes are written gracefully), control the book and serve to focus our attention on the human consequences of the era.  Each chapter could stand on its own, but I found his discussion of artists, actors and writers in the New Deal absolutely rivetting, as were his astounding accounts of the impact of natural disaster on the geographic and emotional landscape of the land.<br />&quot;The Hungry Years&quot; will serve as an important example that history can read as literature and move readers in the same way as art.  Satisfying intellectually and emotionally, &quot;The Hungry Years&quot; inspires historical imagination and furnishes us with a vision of a society not at odds with government, but aligned with a President who perceived that government's most serious and honored obligation is to alleviate suffering.	2001-07-12

Despite the fact that the central character's world revolves around traditionally female concerns (raising children, issues of female sexuality, food, and lingerie), &quot;World of Pies&quot; is an proud evocation of the virtues of small-town life, of the enduring dignity of a coherent family, and of the transforming impact of love on our lives.  This small, easily-read novel is a keeper.<br />The novel, crafted in sequential, chronological chapeters narrating the life of Roxanne Milner of Annette, Texas, vibrates with energy.  Despite the prevalence of food so delicious one wants to run a wrap a napkin around his/her neck and dig in and desserts so decadently delectable that one yearns to try out the recipes thankfully inserted at novel's end, &quot;World of Pies&quot; is not saccharine;  heartbreak, discontent and wrestling with social issues abound, and Ms. Stolz handles the characters' interplay with issues of conscience and social responsibility with subtle sensibilities.  My favorite chapter revolved around Roxanne's unexpected discovery of the quality and depth of love her father possesses for her mother after a former boy-friend of her mother pays a visit; &quot;The Sort of Man My Father Was&quot; can stand by itself as a deeply satisfying short story.<br />We delight in the transformation of Roxanne, whom we meet at age tweleve in love with baseball and bursting with life's ambitions and depart in early middle-age, a mother who has absorbed the best of life's lessons and seems not only willing, but eager, to impart them to her own daughter.  We learn how a sense of place has as large an impact on emotional development as the strength and security of a family whose web of love embraces Roxanne throughout her life.  We share anguish over death, horror over war's enduring casualties, fear at personal disappointment and betrayals and joy at the transformations wrought by love.  &quot;World of Pies&quot; invites the best in our capacities to feel compassion and to identify with others.<br />This joyous, funny and charming book is far more than a summer read.  After but one chapter, you'll want another piece of &quot;World of Pies.&quot;	2001-07-07

Wood's storytelling talents are so fine and evocative that her powerful treatment of the themes of hope, possibility, obligation and family tends to be submerged.  A novel which promises both real insight into the human heart and provokes the reader to introspection and empathy is a work to be cherished.  &quot;My Only Story&quot; maintains pace and believability throughout its wrenching narrative.<br />The author deftly and lovingly introduces a series of characters whose lonely lives reflect fractured families and frustrated dreams.  The protagonist, clairvoyant hairdresser Rita Rosario, struggles with her past, one which includes a family at odds with itself and a fruitless, failed marriage which leaves Rita yearning for completion.  Living in the distressingly recognizable small town of Ashton, Massachusetts, suffering its own loss of identity through its capitulation to late twentieth-century corporate America, Rita refuses to relinquish her sense of what her community ought be.  This steadfast adherence to principle leads to a chance encounter with John Reed, himself a broken, desolate middle-aged man whose life simply has floundered as a consequence of his brother's suicide after having murdered his wife.<br />The ensuing promising romance between Rita and John inspires both hope and possibility.  Readers will discover a deep empathy for John and Rita as they grapple with the intractable chains of duty and responsibility, John with his adorable niece, Aileen, Rita with her fiery, conflicted and bereft sister, Darla.  Wood's treatments of Aileen  --  smothered by a frightening, controlling love of her mother's sisters' families  --  and Darla  --  beautiful, rebellious and cult-bound  --  are remarkable as is her depiction of Beth, another &quot;sister&quot; whoserole develops with extraordinary irony, pride and forgiveness.<br />&quot;My Only Story&quot; is not simple.  The author's deep respect for common people and her commitment to an honest exploration of the texture of love and family, hope and resignation, joy and duty are hallmarks of his important novel.  Readers will treasure the depth of humanity permeating this honorable work.	2001-07-02

Not only is &quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; a noble and vigorous sequel to &quot;October Sky,&quot; the memoir can stand on its own merits as it explores how an ever-growing and conflicted teen-ager struggles with incipient manhood and dissects the hiddent strengths and weaknesses of a small West Virginia mining town.  Hickam's graceful narrative style includes absolutely marvelous dialogue and vivid, memorable characterizations.  Towards the conclusion of the work, Hickam could well be describing his own work:  &quot;Sometimes a writer has to trust his audience to understand that words are as much art as definition.&quot;<br />&quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; permits Hickam to thoroughly explain the first semester of his senior year in high school, the seminally important fall and winter of 1959.  Having experienced initial successes (after numerous failures) in rocket design and propulsion, Homer Hickam must come to grips with a series of anxieties which defy his understanding and sap his confidence.  Increasing doubts ultimately lead to an uncharacteristic submission to self-pity; Homer determines to quit...to quit his dreams, his aloof, demanding father, his own commitments to himself.  Yet, it is a late epiphany which gently guides the maturing young man to a true acceptance and glorious affirmation of the Coalwood way...of commitment to a task, a loyalty to friends and family, a sense of interdependence with local and global community.  The narrative drive of the last one hundred pages is breathtaking and wrenching.  I unabashedly was weeping the last third of the memoir.<br />Yet, &quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; vibrates with humor, irony and humor.  Hickam's characterizations ring with truth, and several characters emerge as even more compelling people than they had in his marvelous initial memoir.  Elsie Hickam, Homer's mother, is simplyan extraordinately admirable woman; her resolute strength in the face of her own dashed expectations and her prescient knowledge of the demise of Coaltown matches her commitment to her beleaguered husband and two sons.  She is fierce in her love and unbreakable in her resolve to see Homer reach his full potential.  The intellectual Quentin receives royal treatment; he blossoms as a young man acutely aware of his physical poverty and mental acuity.  Hickam provides numerous examples of Quentinese (conveniently translated for us) and quietly holds up his friend as a model of steadfast dedication to the life of the mind. Homer's sex life receives wry (and often unheeded) guidance from the redoubtable Big Creek lovemaster, Roy Lee Cooke.  <br />Since Hickam is serious about his personal and social analysis, he draws the character of Dreama with enormous tenderness and compassion.  Slandered by most of the conventional women in town, Dreama yearns to be accepted.  This young adult woman, an outsider without credentials, so wishes for acceptance by the community that she submits to a catastrophic abusive relationship.  Hickam painfully records her life and notes the intersections between Dreama's unfulfilled hopes and his own growing fears about his own self-sufficiency.  Dreama will remain in our literary memory for a long, long time. <br />&quot;The Coalwood Way&quot; affirms Homer Hickam's importance as an interpreter of our national character.  This sure-handed, deeply satisfying memoir should find a place in our personal libraries.	2001-06-23

Ambitious and interesting, this symbolic novel fails to cohere; it is one of those works where the whole is much less than the sum of the parts.  Told in alternating voices (in sections ranging from one to five pages), &quot;Bee Season&quot; bravely attempts to analyze the nature of the American Dream, religious transcendence and the quest for personal authenticity.  Goldberg's insights are not without merit, and it is clear, both from the language chosen and the felicity of style, that the author deserves praise both for her goals and effort.  Nevertheless, by novel's end, I was left with a deep feeling of betrayal and a sense of incompletion.<br />&quot;Bee Season&quot; revolves around the sudden, inexplicable ability of nine-year-old Eliza Naumann to spell.  Suddenly, the forgotten member of this archtypical upper-middle-class Jewish American household becomes the focus, if not of the novel, then certainly of her father's repressed yearning for a child which will gain access to personal, social and familial fulfillment.  Unfortunately, Eliza's success is the catalyst to family catastrophy, and Goldberg's greatest achievement is the terrifying description of family dissolution.<br />Repressed grievances and suppressed yearnings blossom.  Saul, Eliza's father, abandons his son and completely devotes himself to Eliza's spelling.  Only slowly do we come to understand the ulterior motives behind the father's fascination with his daughter.  She represents a chance for Saul to overcome his failures  --  personal, familial and religious  --  as he begins to perceive his daughter as the once-in-a-lifetime student who not only can spell, but receive the mysterious and liberating message of letters themselves.  Eliza, thus, becomes Saul's portal to Jewish mysticism.  Saul, however, does not need to reach that deeply to find a family that has its own mystical qualities.  Hisson, Aaron, abandons Judaism in favor of Krisha consciousness.  His wife, the icy Miriam, falls apart after a lifetime of covert theft; a symbol of her childhood, a kaleidescope, becomes an awful metaphor for a wasted adulthood.<br />The flaws of &quot;Bee Season&quot; keep it from being a remarkable book.  First off, Goldberg inexplicably uses four poins of view in the novel and never allows any one voice or perspective to interpret events.  This decision gives her novel a choppy, disjointed feel.  In addition, her decision to bounce back and forth between voices detes any genuine identification or personal investment in any of the characters.  Secondly, Goldberg is not successful in having &quot;Bee Season&quot; be a vehicle for a discussion of the central themes of of the novel.  Primarily an analysis of personal, religious transcendence and understanding, the novel spends far too much time on Eliza's journey through local, regional and national spelling competitions.  Had Goldberg focused on that aspect of the novel, she would have created a biting, ironic satire of the illusory nature of the American Dream and a devastating commentary on the costs of competition.  Finally, Goldberg does not allow enough time for Miriam's character to develop.  While I understand the need for secrecy (the novel has an obligatory surprise ending), Miriam remains remote throughout the novel, and her distance and its effects on her mate, Saul, and her children are never accorded the time or space necessary for development.<br />Flawed though it may be, &quot;Bee Season&quot; announces the arrival of a fresh voice in American literature.  I am confident that Myla Goldberg will not make the same mistakes in her next effort.	2001-06-17
US	50747195	R15MQ4ZRK83CY0	0525945466	13073784	From Our House: A Memoir	Books	5	6	9	N	N	extraordinary memoir plumbs depths of abuse, anger, and love	Written with extraordinary eloquence, elgance and honesty, Lee Martin's powerful memoir &quot;From  Our House&quot; deserves a national reading audience.  Revealing the horrible and enduring hurt regularly dished out by his angry and bereft father, the author journeys where few have the courage to go:  to the depths of the human heart turned against itself, to the terrain where lives twisted by loss and regret recoil against each other, to the crooks and crannies of our soul where we try to forgive, to start anew, despite all evidence against hope.  Whatever words of praise I write cannot begin to measure the profound respect I have for Lee Martin.  This slender, compelling work will be recognized, I have no doubt, as a masterpiece, and Mr. Martin will be recognized as a skilled and compassionategeographer of how families can enter the darker regions of abuse.<br />Three characters dominate the narrative, which follows the life of the author from childhood through the ultimately redemptive acts of both father and son.  Lee Martin interweaves his story with that of his mother, Beulah, and his father, Roy.  The most poignant character is that of the mother, a woman who married very late in life and appeared to accept an existence of diminished possibiliites.  Beulah emerges as an amazingly strong woman, whose faith and quiet optimism never flags in the midst of a household of anger and violence.  Lee Martin describes her as &quot;a woman of duty and endurance, selfless and without need, at least none she was willing to place before the obligation she felt toward her family.&quot;  Earlier in her life, she battled against her father's alcoholism; her adult life would witness her constant attempts to broken a sense of peace between her enraged husband and alienated and terrified son.  The author is acutely aware of her emotional exhaustion and the gnawing toll an abusive home exacted on her physical and spiritual life.  Ultimately, if anyone triumphs in this memoir, itis she.  Her quiet optimism, faith in the future and belief in the power of forgiveness transcend the violence, anger and mistrust which were the hallmarks of their home.<br />If Beulah symbolizes faith and redemption, Roy represents blasted hopes and unfettered violence.  The author's evocative description of how his father lost his hands in a farming accident foreshadows the rage and sense of impotence that will become life's companions to his father.  Roy regularly whips his son, and for those of us who have felt the anger of a father as expressed through whippings, Lee's understated pain permeates this novel.  Yet, Roy is presented as a whole being.  Lee knows his father is a &quot;sensualist,&quot; whose passions for life were stripped from him by the accident.  We can see Roy's jaws kneading in anger; we feel his hooks clamp into us when he grabbed his son by the throat; we know how he can use powerful words to sublimate the frustrations boiling underneath.<br />Yet, the son, Lee Martin, must be the focus of this memoir.  We see him as a little boy, yearning for the caress and embrace of his father.  Instead, &quot;although he never really maimed me, he often left red marks on my skin, marks that faded more quickly than the heartache that filled me on those occasions.&quot;  Lee senses that his family was skewed and recognized that difference in the other dysfunctional families he encountered in his childhood.  He grows up with a sense of shame, both of his family and of his own apparent evil, for mustn't he by defintion deserve the abuse his father so unsparingly gives him.  His family's move away from his rural origins brings only temporary relief to his family; Lee is an outcast, an outsider  --  both in his new environment and in his own family.  By his adolescence, Lee dallies with delinquency, involving himself in theft and arson.  His eventual embracing of his mother's religious convictions provides the lever by which he may offset his own sense of existential anguish and family displacement.<br />Not only does the author carry the narrative with conviction and purpose, Lee Martin is an amazing writer.  Each page is exquisitely crafted.  His description of his childhood farm/home is Whitmanesque.  As you read this novel, you will constantly comment at how hard this author has worked for you.  Redolent with pain and anguish, &quot;From Our House&quot; instructs us in the manner of living.	2001-06-08

One one hand, it is exquisitely funny; practically every page has a some humorous, pointed or sarcastic comment about pregnancy and/or motherhood.  Karbo's observations, commentaries and asides about these two aspects of womanhood invariably ring true; thus, her humor is not only funny, but perceptive.  However, I also feel it is misadvertising to call this book a novel.  Featuring characters who never arouse any true human connection with the reader and a plot so devoid of originality that the reader finds him/herself yearning to watch a made-for-television movie to stimulate narrative interest, &quot;Motherhood&quot; simply is a lame excuse for a novel.<br />The novel's action revolves around female friendship.  Brooke, whose detached husband Lyle is most animated when playing some inane on-line computer game, takes care of her newborn daughter, Stella and tends to the (gasp) unexpected, unintended, and uninspiring pregnancy of her Amazon-like friend, Mary Rose.  Complicating the threadbare plot is a stereotypically-rich and emotionally-stunted wealthy family and a professional basketball player.  Brooke provides information and advise (always hilarious and most often right on the mark) to Mary Rose throughout the latter's pregnancy and delivery.<br />Nothing in the novel pretends to discuss the issues of single-parenting seriously.  The author simply presumes that it is just fine to engage in casual sex, become pregnant and give birth.  If marriage is the prospect for Mary Rose and her only model is Brooke's marriage, the reader has no doubt that Mary Rose has chosen the right path.  This novel is simply too &quot;precious&quot; on way too many serious issues.  Yet, deep down, I believe that author had no genuine artistic intent in the creation of this work.  Everything that occurs in &quot;Motherhood&quot; does so that Karen Karbo can make some comment about it.<br />And that is why I liked the book as much as I did.  I simply gave up on it being worthwhile literature by page fifty and went along for the humor.  In this regard, Karbo never disappoints.  This work is flat-out terrific in its commentary on motherhood and pregnancy.  Literally every page has some tart, delightful and memorable zinger.  This definition of incipient motherhood (aka the onset of labor) is but one example of Karbo's delicious observations:  &quot;You are at the brink.  You are at the shores of motherhood.  You think you will die.  And you will.  You will never be yourself again.  Motherhood is for women what war is for men.  When they had more wars, more men knew what it was like to be a woman on the verge of being a mother, to be at an absolute point of no return.&quot;  The author's description of the first bowel movement after delivery is a classic.<br />&quot;Motherhood Made a Man Out of Me&quot; is both fast-paced and side-splitting funny.  Unfortunately, it is, at best, a weak excuse for literature.	2001-06-04
US	50747195	R2GUHLOJNXWDEO	0452282330	474882525	Havana Heat: A Novel	Books	4	4	4	N	N	powerful, provocative melodrama features strong characters	Good baseball novels transcend the sport itself and reveal understandings of how the game mirrors and develops our national character.  Additionally, our best sports novelists encourage us to broaden our historical imaginations and inspire us to show empathy for conflicted characters who encounter both athletic and personal crises.  Darryl Brock's convincing &quot;Havana Heat&quot; ably captures baseball's enduring importance as a metaphor for our national experience and deftly explores the influences of frustrated ambition, unvarnished competition and crippling racism in the sport itself.  Though set in the early days of the twentieth century, the novel maintains a timelessness through its conflicted, but admirable protagonist.<br />The baseball described in &quot;Heat&quot; is meticulously accurate, yet the novel's rather formulaic melodramatic structure is not its dominant strength.  Instead, Brock's vivid characterizations and his passioate commitment to historical accuracy are the hallmarks of this strong novel.  Focusing on the attempted comeback of  former New York Giant hurler Luther &quot;Dummy&quot; Taylor and the obstacles confronting a renewal of his career erected by the irascible, intemperate and tyrannical manager, John McGraw, the novel reveals the internal tensions and ambivalences Lu experiences during a 1911 barnstorming tour in Cuba.  Taylor learns, at times reluctantly and painfully, that a person's worth is determined by much more than his win-loss record, that development of character and hope are more vital than prolonging a moribund career, that the satisfactions of teaching far outweigh the evanscent thrills of victory.  Ultimately, Brock's greatest virtue as a novelist is his knack for using the action of the game and fluidity of the sport as representations of the human capacity for growth, self-forgiveness and redemption.<br />And that's not all.  Brock writes with a refined and welcomed advocacy for the hearing impaired.  Even though deaf players in the dead-ball era were invariably called &quot;Dummy,&quot; at least they were in the big leagues.  Where are the hearing impaired role models today in the national sport?  The author's eloquent description of signing speaks directly to how much Brock believes sports novelists can write about much more than the game:  &quot;People who feel sorry for deaf folks don't have it quite right.  Sign is a rich language...it also makes for a special kind of closeness.  For one thing, you have to pay closer attention to others when you can't hear their words.  You come to know them in ways that are direct and intimate.&quot;<br />Finally, Brock pays painstaking attention to detail.  His historical descriptions of the atrocities a Kansas regiment committed while fighting against the revolutionary insurgents in the Philippines and his deft inclusion of reconcentration camps in rural Cuba by the Spanish (which left a heritage of bitterness and racial division) are but two examples of how hard the author worked to create a sense of authenticity.  &quot;Havana Heat&quot;'s melodramatic structure is the only weakness in an otherwise compelling and convincing novel.	2001-05-30

The author boldly tackles a myriad of issues, ranging from the profound psyhcological scars which have endured in Native Americanbs to the causation and remediation of juvenile delinquency.  In between, Ms. Thon involves a deaf narrator who, mysteriously and oh-so-profoundly, provides enlightenment as to the whys of her family's disintegration and her nephew's involvement in a life's work of violence and social degradation.  Make no mistake about it; Ms. Thon should be praised for her willingness to explore very difficult themes.  Yet, she also needs to know that it is possible to write a book that is important without having the novel bludgeon you with the message that &quot;THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BOOK.&quot;<br />&quot;Sweet Hearts&quot; is actually three books within one, and no one aspect ever attains either the artisitic or moral integrity necessary for success.  At times brutally candid and psychologically instructive to the anguish and degradation that successive generations of Native Americans have internalized, the novel digresses into disjointed (and occasionally incoherent) internal monologues by the deaf narrator, Marie, whose own life could be the basis of a novel itself.  Thon, more often than not, tantalizes the reader with her knowledge of Native American history and social psychology, but she never fully integrates this perception into understanding a second section of &quot;Sweet Hearts,&quot; the fractured relationship between two siblings, angelic and emotionally undernourished Cecile and her violence-crazed half-brother, Flint.  Once again, Thon presents a carefully researched view of juvenile delinquency, the juvenile justice system and prison brutality (if you don't believe me, just look at her footnotes).  This section of the novel opened up the greatest possibilities; yet whenever the author seemed to engross the reader in the cascading wreck of the two childrens' lives, she managed to meander into yet another section of her novel, that being an exploration of family and the inevitable pull of the past on those living today.  The fascinating and marvelously imagined family tree of Marie and her tormented sister Frances too infrequently bears fruit; once again, the author seemed determined to avoid coherence at any cost.<br />I have no question that Melanie Rae Thon understands the beauty and mystery of language.  There are numerous passages in this well-meaning novel which simply soar.  However, these glimpses into the genuine talent of the author are overwhelmed by page after page of rambling, disjointed internal interrogatories and passages so overwritten that they simply could be skipped by a discerning reader without any loss of understanding or empathy. I cannot share the warm reviews of other readers; &quot;Sweet Hearts&quot; is a noble but flawed work.	2001-05-24

Make no mistake about it; Ciresi is drop-dead funny in her recounting how desperately unhappy Angel is to be stuck in a family whose immigrant father's unquestioning acquiesence in a dull blue-collar life is matched only by the stench of his feet after he has removed his shoes after a day's labor and whose mother is so controlling, so unwilling to question her role or her family's dreary, predictable existence that she packs suppositories on a church-sponsored journey to the Statue of Liberty.  After all, her mother reasons, you just never know what might happen.<br />Growing up yearning to be a true American, with a real American name and real American possibilities consumes Angel, who not only must contend with her parents' suffocating adherence to what she considers to be an alienating ethnic identity but most also deal with the reality that she comes in second fiddle to her glamorous, worldly older sister.  Ciresi's recounting of the drive for second generation immigrant children to challenge their parents and consciously repudiate their life-styles receives exceptional treatment in &quot;Orphan Train,&quot; a chapter which I am convinced will become anthologized under the topics of &quot;names and identities.&quot;<br />The humor and ironic observations of childhood dissolve in the second half of the novel where the depressed Lina and the isolated Angel stumble badly through their adult lives.  Trapped in a loveless (but externally perfect marriage), Lina entertains escapist fantasies and indulges in both an extramarital affair and an attempted suicide.  After crafting an uproarious fantasy &quot;Woman Seeking Man&quot; want ad, Angel settles for a stultifyingly bland (but mildly controlling) professor.  This relationship, which at least promised the hope of romance, dwindles as well.<br />The author robust and graceful style make &quot;Sometimes I Dream&quot; a book you will want to devour.  I am confident that Ms. Ceresi's work will soon find itself as an Oprah recommended novel.  I am sure the work will find its way onto countless reading club lists.  Count me as one reader who can hardly wait for her next novel.	2001-05-19
US	50747195	RVK60SSMCX5QH	0195146042	724242239	Past Time: Baseball As History	Books	5	6	8	N	N	provocative, enjoyable synthesis of baseball and history	When Professory Jules Tygiel presented his authoritative analysis of Jackie Robinson in &quot;Baseball's Great Experiment,&quot; he gave notice that writing about baseball could not only reflect history but provide lovers of the &quot;national game&quot; a sense of how baseball reflected and influenced the society in which they live. His most recent effort, &quot;Past Time,&quot; is a splendid integration of baseball and the dominant social and economic themes resonating around and through the sport.  Written in nine chapters, each representing an inning/era in baseball's past, Professor Tygiel explores numerous athletic and historical themes in a beautifully written and thoroughly researched volume.  It belongs not only on shelves of those, like me, who love the sport, but those, like me, who believe that imaginative and provocative histories can help assist all of us in understanding who we are and how we became the way we are.<br />Readers could enjoy this volume by selecting any one of the chapters;  although the work is presented chronologically, Professor Tygiel offers each &quot;inning&quot; as its own entity.  The meticulous research that entered into his writing (the book has some twenty pages of footnotes) weaves seamlessly into truly graceful writing.  As he would say of DiMaggio, &quot;he makes it look easy.&quot;  There are trenchant observations on baseball as business, on the place of a ballclub in a city's self-definition and how the media has enhanced and democratized the sport.  <br />I especially enjoyed his talented analysis of the impact of media on the sport.  From print journalism, which helped create fans to the advent of visual media (ably noted as &quot;new ways of knowing&quot;) to the impact of electronic dissemination of information, baseball has enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with mass communication.  I was most impressed with his description of Henry Chadwick, whose devotion to the scientific and reform ideas he saw as essential to baseball's success, the father of baseball statistics.  Readers will no doubt delight remembering Chadwick's invention of the stories &quot;batting average&quot; when they consider the impact of Bill James' type of information in their modern sensibilities.<br />There are nuggets of unmitigated delight here as well.  Tygiel wonderously describes Babe Ruth becoming mute during an early radio interview and having his voice replaced by the moderator; nobody knew the difference and many commented on how well Ruth spoke.  Then, Tygiel gives an absolutely fascinating commentary on Russ Hodges' famous &quot;The Giants win the pennant&quot; call after Bobby Thompson hit his &quot;shot heard 'round the world.&quot;  Not only that, he provides insight into how a prescient statistic analyst, Dodger employee Allan Roth, sadly predicted the very homerun which upset his beloved team.<br />Written with a love of the sport, a respect for the glorious cadences of the human voice and a knowledge of the political, economic and social interaction of sport and society, &quot;Past Time&quot; will emerge as one of the essential works on baseball every fan of the game and of the country will want to own.	2001-05-15

Trigiani invests Ave Maria with the literary gifts of believability, supporting characters who vex and delight the reader, and a setting (the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia) absolutely real and gracious.  &quot;Gap&quot; defies easy categorization, as it has both comic and deeply sad moments; yet it is a quintessential American book  --  big-hearted, conflict-riddled and triumphant.<br />The protagonist, shattered by the death of her beloved, immigrant mother, outlines the basic challenge she faces as a middle-aged, independent, but lonely woman:  &quot;Pracitical Ave Maria must go.  Me.  The never-married town pharmacist who is never caught without her first aid kit...The girl who built her life so carefully so she'd never have to ask anybody for anything.   I have had it with me.&quot; Trigiani sculpts her novel around Ave Maria's inability to feel, to act on impulses of love, to become something other than Big Stone Gap's sensible, efficient, spinster-like institution.  <br />Soon enough, Ave Maria must determine not only how to treat multiple marriage proposals but to come to grips with her own startling origins.  Trigiani is simply extraordinary in he resolution of Ave Maria's quest for identity, never compromising real epiphany for cliched answers.<br />We are fortunate to lie in times where American women authors are so adroit in mining the human heart and presenting works of literature which instruct us as to what loving relationships are and how we, in our stumbling, awkward ways, learn to accept ourselves and have faith in each other.  Trigiani prophetically states that &quot;the great mysteries in life can only be solved person to person.  We can pull each other through.&quot;  Americans are lucky to have yet another Southern  woman to be our guide to the truths of the heart.	2001-05-15
US	50747195	R34LPZQM1RBPQH	1585670677	588981575	Coney	Books	2	8	10	N	N	Mundane &quot;Coney&quot; is tepid, dense and ultimately superficial	I had looked forward with great anticipation to Amram Ducovny's debut novel, &quot;Coney.&quot;  The novel, which examines both Jewish immigrant life and the culture of midway freaks of Coney Island life in the days immediately before World War II, sadly wasa major disappointment.  Overpopulated with stock characters, laden with &quot;atmosphere&quot; which tinly substitutes for a paucity of genuine insight, and caricaturing Jewish immigrant life instead of shedding light on its weaknesses and inconsistencies, the novel lacks the literary consistency and moral strength of Kevin Baker's &quot;Dreamland,&quot; a work which treats many of the same themes Ducovny's work does not come close to presenting.<br />The numerous characters which flood the pages of &quot;Coney&quot; never have a chance to develop themselves.  Even the most sympathetic of them, the tormented boarder-poet Aba and the drastically overweight Queen Fifi, always seem on the verge of becoming authentic characters, but Ducovny never permits them the time or consequence in the narrative to evolve.  The central character, the  youthful Harry Catzker, bounces between being a wise, nearly dispassionate observer and a sympathetic, frustrated teen-ager shackled by his immigrant parents and stunted by the poverty-induced decadence of Coney Island life in 1930s Brooklyn.<br />&quot;Coney&quot; is not without merit, and Ducovny certainly has a wonderful ear for dialogue.  His insertion of periodic conversations between Harry (Hershele) and Aba ring with symbolic and literal truth.  These brief &quot;Cherry Tree&quot; interludes are, to me, the best part of the novel.  Ducovny also excels in revealing the tension between immigrant parents and their children; his portrait of the friction between Harry's embittered mother and his repressive maternal grandmother crackle with genuine anger and betrayal.<br />However, the novel never escapes its tendency towards romanticizing, even stereotyping, its characters.  Hiscompassionate portraits of the profound misery felt by Coney's sideshow freaks seem both predictable and staged; each &quot;misfit&quot; seems to possess a nobility born of underserved suffering.  This &quot;heart-of-gold&quot; touch wears thin quickly.  The nefarious gangsters have all the believability of bad guys from 1930s B movies.  Even Ducovny's foreshadowing of of the horrors of the Holocaust seem to be literary cliches rather than engendering fear of the ominous signs of genocidal catastrophy.<br />Despite its good intentions, &quot;Coney&quot; never escapes its flaws.  Readers who desire insight into Jewish-immigrant life in New York, the depressing life of side-show freaks or commentary on the seemingly endless nastiness of life in general would be better served by reading more competent treatments.	2001-05-05

As marvelous as the film is, the memoir, &quot;October Sky&quot; soars above it.  Homer Hickam, Jr. has created a modern American masterpiece in the memoir genre.  Borrowing a complimentary phrase from the cerebral rocket-boy friend Quentin, it is a &quot;prodigous&quot; work.  Part coming-of-age, part exploration of a bygone community and way of life, part treatise of the frustrations, joys, and beauties of the scientific method, &quot;October Sky&quot; not only will instuct you as to what it means to be an American; it will provide gentle, poignant and perceptive insight as to what it means to be human.<br />The author provides the best capsule summary of the memoir with his concluding words.  He attempts to pain a verbal picture of the impact of &quot;rockets that once leapt into the air, propelled not by physics but by the vibrant love of an honorable people, and the instruction of a dear teacher, and the dreams of boys.&quot;  This immensely readable work treats, with extraordinary dignity, the social, intellectual, and moral dimensions of Coalwood, West Virginia during the intense period of time when the United States first confronted the Soviet Union in what became known as the &quot;space race.&quot;  Admidst the exquisite characters sketches drawn by Hickam of his family, youthful colleagues, and teachers, we see a town deeply conflicted with itself.  These subterranean faults, expressed methaphorically by the coal mine which Homer's driven and distant father supervises, appear within the Hickam household, between the United Mine Workers Union and the archaic benevolent paternalism of Homer Hickam, Sr., between prejudicial townspeople, whose derisive epithet &quot;rocket boys&quot; evolves into a hymn of respect and prase, and the residents (African-American, Jewish, hillbillies, miners, and teachers) who identify with the aspirations or Homer and his idealistic young friends.<br />This is an account of the meaning of friendship, of how young men define themselves, of how heartache over lost romance is assuaged by an ironically assertive &quot;tough&quot; young woman.  It is a memoir which utterly reveals the strong but tormented marriage of Homer's parents; we watch, with complete respect, Homer's mother emerge as one a most principled and couageous woman.   Indeed, it is Homer's mother who emerges as a genuine hero throughout the rocket boys bumpy, humorous but resolute path to success.<br />It is my hope that this volume will find its way into every American household, that fathers and mothers will read it aloud to their sons and daughters, and that educators will embrace the numerous opportunities to teach (literature, math, science, history, ethics) through this book.	2001-05-01
US	50747195	R1XPGKQ6JCCYBS	0393320480	309404288	The Electrical Field: A Novel	Books	3	3	3	N	N	somber, convoluted treatment of Japanese-Canadian relocation	Kerri Sakamoto's brooding and dark novel, &quot;The Electrical Field&quot; is complicated, tantalizing, but ultimately frustrating and seomwhat manipulative.  Probing the terrible and unresolved scars caused by the repressive and racist removal and forced relocation of Japanese-Canadians, the novel depends on the fractured, distorted and submerged memories of its narrator who is partyto a set of homicides.  Asako Saito, burdened by the death of her beloved older brother, Eiji, during relocation, swirls between past and present, unsure of her own observations, numbed by loneliness and confused by emotional swings.<br />Ms. Sakamoto's comnpassionately and deftly explores the psychology of her protagonist, and only slowly does the &quot;truth,&quot; of present homicides and past relocation, emerge.  However, I felt as if I were being manipulated, that denial of essential information (submerged and distorted in Asako's mind) inhibited rather than clarified understanding.  Thus, by novel's end, as Asako comes to grips with her life and the shattered ruins of her memory, I had lost whatever sympathy I struggled to maintain for her.<br />Despite my reservations, I do consider &quot;Field&quot; an important contribution to our understanding of the ramifications of the horrific consequences of sanctioned government racism.  Though not of the quality of her sister Canadian Joy Kogawa's novels, &quot;Field&quot; is at its best when it describes two profoundly different reactions to relocation:  the passionate anger and demand for redress of Yano and the smothered sadness and drive for oblivion in Asako.  Both characters persuasively remind us that forgetting is simply not an option and that past injustices leave incredibly complex scars.  The author symbolically depicts the isolation and displacement of post-relocation life; the looming cage-like electrical towers and the ominous garbage-made hill (carrying the name of the prime minister who ordered relocation) are terrific examples of imagery.<br />This deserved praise cannot rescue &quot;The Electrical Field&quot; from its excessive murkiness.  In this regard, we must await Kerri Sakamoto's future work to see if she can live up to the thwarted promise of her first novel.	2001-04-24

Unlike the first three volumes, which were joyous and whimsical explorations of family and place, this final volume carries the burdens of age:  the author says farewell to beloved parents and realizes that the cherished characteristics of one's home may endure only in memory and not in reality.  For the Appalachia of Jess Kirkman has become vulgarized with strip malls and ersatz accents, and the improbable, imaginative and soaring stories of his father, Joe Robert, are now tinged with a subtle hurt  --  a knowing sense that, ultimately, Jess must come to grips with not only his father's death, but his own mortality.  This sense of finality, in the author's words, makes not only Jess, but the reader, &quot;melancholy, homesick for times I could never reclaim, for hours that I had seemed to lose even when I had lived through them.&quot;<br />The narrative, as in the case of all the Jess Kirkman novels, is incidental to the story telling and character sketches.  Cora Kirkman, the mother of Mitzi and Jess, the matriarch of the family, confronts a terminal illness with the knowledge that her planned burial next to her beloved, iconoclastic and fanciful husband Joe Robert will not occur due to an unfortunate oversight at an overcrowded and oversubscribed cemetary.  Ultimately resolving the problem with techniques his father surely would have loved, Jess discovers yet more of his father's fertile, secret life  --  schemes that treat everything from improbable travel through time and space to deciphering a map whose locations feature the names of mysterious women.  Chappell's familiar mastery of the Appalachian idiom, his marvelous ability to tell a story and his unabashed respect for the people and physical environment of Appalachia appear again in this novel.  What is different is the sense of finality in the writing; the novel's very title, taken from a fetching Appalachian song, denotes a sense of pespective and farewell.  Though his father has been dead some ten years, it is painfully clear how fiercely Jess still loves his father and how deep, keep and present is his sense of loss.  Indeed, the mournful aura of &quot;Look Back&quot; provides solace to any reader whose lie has been diminished by the loss of a parent and whose grief is so real that it feels freshly minted.  Even laughter brought by fond memories is washed in tears.<br />It is this sense of summary and conclusion which ironically saps &quot;Look Back&quot; from the vitality and conviction of the first three volumes of the series.  Joe Robert's life is much more memory and recollection than living presence, and Jess' anguish over a final farewell to his family's past hands, dirge-like, over the writing.  What original stories there are in &quot;Look Back&quot; sparkle with tender humor and gentle wisdom; unfortunately, far too many stories are recounted with a dependence on the reader's memory of previous volumes.  The multi-talented poet, essayist and novelist Fred Chappell is truly a national treasure.  Though not up to the standards of his previous works, &quot;Look Back&quot; will add to his much-deserved reputation.	2001-04-23

Part history, part biography of his beloved, steadfast mother, and part introspective autobiography, &quot;Color&quot; is one of those rare volumes which simultaneously educates and inspires.  It is written in the crucible of love, pain and discovery and treats the most profoundly troublesome issues of our national experience:  race and religion, how one becomes an American and at what costs, what constitutes a family, and the seemingly impossible quest for identity in the child/adult of &quot;mixed&quot; parentage.<br />&quot;Color&quot; is written in alternating chapters with alternating voices.  Mr. McBride describes and analyzes his own life with extraordinary care and precision.  Looming above his growth is his mother, a Jewish immigrant who eventually embraces Christianity, a white who twice marries African-American men, a victim of a truly villainous father, an indominable force in her own family for education and faith.  McBride not only understands how his mother represents these volcanic character faults and stresses; he clearly analyzes how the contradictory impulses swirling within Rachel/Ruth McBride Jordan coalesce and cohere.<br />McBride's mother, both in his descriptions and her own delicious, acerbic, trusting, dynamic, forceful, strident and moving language, is a genuine American icon  --  or ought to be.  A Jewish Christian, white who realy is black, Southerner who lives in Brooklyn, immigrant and archtypical Amerianized immigrant  -- Ruth/Rachel speaks directly to us.  I truly believe that no-one could read her words dry-eyed.  Sections of her life's story simply left me devastated, only to be wrenched back to reality with a tart, sardonic comment.  McBride's mother is not only personally wise, she is sociologically perceptive.  Her comments on the possibilities and costs of Americanization ring true today:  &quot;Mameh's sisters were more about money than anything else, and any hurts that popped up along the way, they just swept them under the rug.  They were all trying hard to be American, you know, not knowing what to keep and what to leave behind.  But you know what happens when you do that.  If you throw water on thge floor, it will always find a hole, believe me.&quot;<br />I feel &quot;Color&quot; ought be required reading for every American.  Rich in love and faith, this memoir reminds us that our deepest wounds and most terrible hurts and betrayals can be overcome if we possess a love for education, a steadfast faith and a parent who never, never, never lets us forget how deeply we are loved.	2001-04-23

The author, Sharon Oard Warner, uses the vehicle of a contested abortion to treat, with skill and sensitivity, the themes of family secrets and fragility, the loss and possibility of love in and around marriage, and the enormous impact conscience has in driving our everyday actions.  This large and fast-paced novel is the product of an author who genuinely cares about her readers; Ms. Warner always rises above cliche and takes great risks in emphasizing the humanity of her charcters, all of whom are deeply involved in one of the pivotal political struggles of our day, abortion.<br />Quite late in the book, Dr. Hannah Solace realizes that her husband, Carl, devloped his love for her not from her beauty, but from her sadness.  This understanding symbolizes the wholeness of the novel and encapsulates the underlying emotion felt by the reader.  For &quot;Heart&quot; is a profoundly sad novel, although by book's end, the enduring qualities of hope, love and faith genuinely resolve themselves with an opitimistic view of the future.  Each character is washed in hues of loneliness, despair and abandonment.  Hannah, who is an admirable, articulate modern woman, suffers terribly from the memory of the childhood death of her mother; the resulting pressures and fear create an adult removed from her feelings and ultimately, her husband.  Carl, an artist whose adult life swims in unfulfilled dreams of art and a responsive partner, yearns for a child to give a sense of animation and purpose to his life.  One of the book's central ironies is the dissolution of a marriage after an abortion rather than because of one.  The virginal Penny, who at the age of 23 seems resigned to a life outside the perameters of love, discovers complexity and multi-dimensional perspectives in the midst of an attempted romance with an intolerant, charismatic evangelical minister, whose own life abounds with internal conflict.  <br />Ms. Oard presents a simply brilliant collage of motherhood.  Hannah's sister, Helen, initially seems to be the model of stay-at-home contentment.  As the novel progresses, turmoil and betrayal erode her confidence (the author often comments about the terrible state of her fingernails).  Penny's mother, Delia, is swathed in secrets and Penny, herself, is suffused with a sense of abandonment.  Penny's grandmother, Mattie, who ignores her own past and her daughter's torment, tries to serve as a mother-figure for Penny but is limited by her own guilt and restricted by her adherence to a faith which promises life but deals with its own prejudices and death-obsessions.<br />Ms. Warner informs us that she spent seven years and went through seven drafts before completing her novel.  I can assure you that it was well worth her time and worth our wait.  &quot;Deep in the Heart&quot; resonates with truth.	2001-04-06

They are the voices of her parents, devout leaders of the First Assembly of God Church and they are the skeptical, worldy voices of her &quot;sinful&quot; neighbors, the Woolworths. They are the voices of her own personal demon, Fred, who regularly berates her attempts at religious devotion and assure he she will surely roast in hell, and the comforting imaginary sounds of the hedge around her church which assures her that her secrets are safe.  The sounds come from her rebellious and captivating older sister, Colleen, who insists that she truly does not belong to this arcane family.  The voices come from Little Richard and Aretha Franklin, who, almost as if in conspiracy against God, liberate Roxanne to discover who and what she is.<br />This fast-paced novel, after all, deals with life in capital letters.  There are the Christians (renouncing the corrupt world in which they life and always preparing, always anticipating Rapture) and the Sinners (people like me, who enjoy the world and all of its illicit pleasures).  Despite Winston's valiant attempts to purify his family (this pastor even enjoys deconstructing Das Kapital to prove its irrelevance to Christians), he never loses his humanity, and his resolve to live a morally pure life contains an unalloyed dignity.  Winston repudiates travelling evangelists (whom Huffey scathingly portrays as hypocrites and con-men) and even literally throws money away from an airplane as an object lesson about devotion to his conflicted daughter.  He is a strong father and the reader cannot help but like him.  <br />The true beauty of the novel lives in Roxanne, whose adventures in the real world contain a surreal quality.  Never permitted to experience life as her contemporaries did in the 1950s, Roxanne must rely on her imagination and her desperate need to disover her authentic voice.  As Roxanne tells us, God does not like &quot;alcohol, tobacco, sleeveless dresses, all nudity, lipstick, fingernail  polish, earrings, rock and roll, Elvis Presley, dancing, movies, roller skating, swearing, murder, lies...and...Partagas Robusto cigars.  The rest Roxy tried not to think about.&quot;  Despite this (or perhaps because of it), Roxanne's spiritual quest is all the more compelling.  How she reconciles faith and ability, religion and music, family and the world are skillfully rendered by an author whose own experience with faith and art give her first novel an air of authenticity.	2001-03-30

Precisely and elegantly crafted, the novel's setting, the fiercely beautiful and forbidding praire of eastern Montana, unrelentingly batters both the characters and the reader.  Focusing on the psychological development of its three central characters, &quot;Winter Range&quot; explores the theme of adult responsibility, especially in the face of trauma, discontent and rebellion.  A daunting winter brings to the breaking point the taut tensions between an honorable sheriff, Ike Parsons, his proud but haunted wife Pattiann, and a truly malicious misanthrope, Chas, whose unrequited passion for Pattiann complicates an absorbing conflict between the characters, their own pasts and their abilities to survive an environment seemily indifferent to their circumstances.  Ms.  Davis provides a powerful and compelling response to her own core question:  when do we stop blaming others and begin accepting our  lives as our own, as flawed as they may be, for what they truly are?<br />Ultimately, the author has each character commit to an answer provided by Pattiann as she sorts out the conflicts engendered by a restrictive upbrining and her love of a man whose calm restores her sense of self.  &quot;Isn't there a time when a peson has to say, all right, now this is the rest of my life?  And I'm accountable fo that?&quot;  &quot;Winter Range&quot; picks up momentum throughout its fast-paced narrative, and the conclusion is both liberating and forbidding.<br />I also feel a need to compliment the author on how hard she worked for the reader.  For this is a beautifully crafted piece of literature.  She has a marvelous sense of imagery.  Take, for example, her description of parents' grief after the death of their child.  &quot;And now he was dead and his parents, early in their middle years, would wake the rest of their days and know the relentless taste of grief as sharp and cold on their tongues as metal on a winter's morning.&quot;  Ms. Davis constantly reinvents  the Montana plains, from its fickle abundance to its devastating winters; those who live and work as cattle ranchers receive unspoken, but genuine, homage through her descriptions of their environment.<br />This dark, brooding and intense novel signals the advent of an accomplished author.  In tune with the people she describes, Claire Davis offers us unusual and timely insights into the adult mind.	2001-03-24

Additionally, every child should be able to receive respect, acceptance and love from his/her parents.  Lillie, the courageous and defiant protagonist of Anne Marino's talented debut novel, &quot;The Collapsible World,&quot; receives neither stablity or comfort from her parents, and her sense of spiritual abandonment permeates her life.  The novel's methaphorical title, based on an 1860 globe, deftly describes Lillie's life: &quot;my world...constantly cascades...[and] has been collapsing for some time now.&quot;<br />Ms. Marino depicts a family tormented by an abundance of talent and a dearth of coherence.  As a child, the oldest daughter, Nina  --  brilliant and possessing an off-the-chart intelligence  -- was trotted around town like some prized pet by her drug-addicted anaesthesiologist father.  Consequently, Nina elects to become a stripper in San Francisco's North Beach, burns with resentment and disappointment in her father and has a brittle relationship with him.  As for the mother, Midge deserts her husband and two daughters after a lifetime's worth of lies and repressed frustrations.  In search for some emotional nourishment, Lillie receives extraordinary validation from a wonderfully-portrayed Finch, whose interest in cartography and, more importantly, in Lillie anchors the lonely and yearning surrogate daughter to life.  Another honorable charcter is Rick, a handsome cop who lovingly seeks to develop a one-night stand into a genuine relationship with Lillie.  One of the central ironies of the novel is its portrait of stable relationships ouside the family circle; indeed, Lillie's most important sources of adult guidance and love come from without and not within the family.<br />Ms. Marino writes with a condensed, powerful style.  Her characters are compelling (and that includes the utterly execrable father, Larry), and the novel never descends into cliche.  Several warnings are due the reader, however.  I'm always wary of families in which the children call their parents by their first names; in this respect, Larry and Midge's indifference to their children was hardly a surprise.  As well, even though Lillie deals with maps all her life and has an extraordinary sense of place, I found Ms. Marino's constant specific references to San Francisco streets and addresses a bit excessive.  Nevertheless, I am convinced that this is an important and timely novel, one  which ought be read by an audience which has concern about the unique anguish adult children experience in the light of their parents' failures.	2001-03-19

Kent Haruf's spellbinding &quot;Plainsong&quot; so deftly recreates the atmosphere of a small, isolated, rural American town and populates that community with such compelling, conflicted and endearing characters that the reader simply cannot put his novel down.  As did Steinbeck before him (and as do such gifted contemporaries as Kaye Gibbons and Ivan Doig), Mr. Haruf truly believes common, everyday Americans have much to say about what defines the national character.  There is such dignity and decency in this book, shown against backdrops of cruelty, isolation and loneliness.  Perhaps that is one reason I found myself humbled, by book's end, in reading it.  This is a book to cherish and to share and will become one of the most memorable reading experiences in your life.<br />This profoundly important work will remind readers what the purpose of literature is:  to inform us, through the action of an absorbing narrative, that humans serve a distinctive purpose, and that purpose, though obscured by personal anguish, desperate lonelines and unfair circumstances, is to understand, assist and grow to love each other.  Each of the seven central characters, who evolve into their own community, seems driven to comprehend and act on the central premise of human frailty and interdependence.  Thus, whether it be a father coping with the fragility of his sons' emotional health in light of their mother's evolving emotional and physical removal from life or a quietly resolute teacher searching for solutions to a teen's unexpected pregnancy or two old bachelor brothers awakening to the confusing, liberating possibilities of life, Mr. Haruf invests them with uncommon purpose and promise.<br />Thomas Jefferson once said that our nation possesses &quot;hope enough and to spare.&quot;  Reading this triumphant novel, a reader will find renewal in the belief that our national purpose  --  built on  a sense of optimism and hope  --  continues to live and to thrive in the hearts and minds of our most uncommom common people.l find renewal in the belief that our national purpose  --  built on  a sense of optimism and hope  --  continues to live and to thrive in the hearts and minds of our most uncommom common people.	2001-03-17

Laced with extremely explicit descriptions of sexual acts, Maureen Gibbon's debut novel traces the desperately joyless life of Vangie Raybuck and her close friend, June Keel.  We watch, with horror and fascnation, as Angie's relationship with her lover Del flowers by the intensity of their mutual sexual passion and collapses by Del's drug addiction and Vangie's debilitating capacity to engage in lies and self-deception.  Indeed, the novel brilliantly chronicles the theme of self-destruction, and its irony of portraying that immolation through the most intimate of human intercourse gives &quot;Swimming&quot; its power.<br />The sheer power and volume of sexual activity detailed in the novel should not be mistaken for the author's parallel emphasis on the halting, but very real discovery of personal integrity and authentic identity by Angie.  Her growing awareness of the emptiness of her life is fueled by her self-reproach over a series of actions and lies which lay bare the non-existence of her relationship with Del and her increasingly complicated friendship with June.  Personal betrayal, lies and deceit flow like subterranean rivers throughout this fast-paced novel.<br />Contemporary authors are giving increased scrutiny to the despair and frustrations of blue-collar Americans, and the interpretation Ms. Gibbon provides is not a comforting one.  Trapped by tough jobs, limited by a sense of powerlessnes and bound by a lack of future, both Vangie and June allow their bodies to be the means of expressing discontent and yearning.  Their inability to articulate the nature of their attraction to the men in their lives, their willingness to submit to (and to abet) sexual degradation, their anger and frustration with the results of this submission, the seeming non-existence of horizons...all these combine to add to the aura of bleakness in this novel. &quot;Swimming&quot; deserves the praise and attention it will undoubtedly receive.	2001-03-14

The author compels our attention with a riveting account of a surprising inter-generational frienship between two unlikely participants: one a grieving, tradition-bound mother, the other, a brazen, abused young woman who scandalizes a small Arkansas African-American community with her open and frank sexuality.  Ms. McFadden's compassionate characterizations of the older Pearl Taylor and the fascinating younger Sugar Lacey are, without question, the greatest achievements of the novel.  In addition, drawing on her professed admiration for &quot;the art of storytelling,&quot; the author has drawn an engaging portrait of the strengths and weaknesses of small-town African-American life during the middle of the twentieth century.  The staid women of Bigelow, Arkansas become the canvas on which Pearl defies convention and befriends the despised (and covertly envied) Sugar.  Hovering over this fast-paced novel is the brutal, unsolved murder of Joe and Pearl Taylor's beloved daughter, Jude.  Ever present is the ubiqitous racism and concurrent racial isolation which tinges Bigelow with both stgrength and resolve in the face of removal from &quot;mainstream&quot; America.  Ms. McFadden treats with real skill a variety of themes ranging from repressed sexuality, the nature of prostitution, the obligations of family, the place of memory in maintaining the idea of family, exposure of small-town hypocrisy to redemptive forgiveness.<br />Moderating my delight with this commendable novel are several things, however.  &quot;Sugar&quot; tends to be overwritten; Ms. McFadden clearly delights in vivid visual imagery, but she often overwhlems of the reader instead of permitting us to use our own imaginations.  She also engages in what I considered to be gratuitous anti-semitism in her depiction of one of the more unsavory and ugly men in Sugar's life.  Why the author would tend to emphasize this character's Jewishness in light of the other racist white men in the novel is never adequately explained.  Finally, the novel contains a technological discrepancy that bothered me.  At the novel's outset, the Begelow is a community lagging behind more affluent communities in its technology; Pearl, in fact, has only recently obtained a telephone.  Several months later, at Thanksgiving, her husband and son retire to the front room to watch football on television.  Although this may seem to be caviling about minutae, the novel depends on enviornment and setting, and this discrepancy weakens credibility.	2001-03-10

Told in chapters which alternate between a mother and daughter's point of view, the novel focuses on a disintegrating marriage between a deeply frustrated housewife and her increasingly embittered husband and an engaging, creative daughter who, incidentially, perceives the future through images gleaned from staring at a test pattern on her family's new television.  Set in 1954, the novel captures the extraordinary (and subterranean) influence television exerts on American culture; Klein is at her very best in the numerous instances where she describes how television alters and redefines personal expectations, perceptions and, most alarmingly, identity.  The grace of &quot;Test Pattern&quot; is its ability to treat very serious issues with extraordinary humor, delightful dialogue and a pitch-perfect sense of what blue-collar American was like in the so-called golden age of television.<br />Klein has created two compelling characters in the repressed Lorena Palmer and her fascinating, sensitive daughter Cassie.  It is clear the author carries considerable compassion for both:  the mother, locked in a loveless marriage she initially believed was the embodiment of the American Dream, and the daughter, terribly conflicted over her family's disintegration and her &quot;gift&quot; of perception no-one else, less a bohemian artist, seems to respect, much less understand.  Lorena is a fully-rendered character.  She &quot;weeps for lost dreams, repressed ambitions, for time rolling on without her.  For her depressing past, her dismal present, and the possibility...of a future slapped down by the hand of fate.&quot;  In circumstances as zany as any to which Lucille Ball gave comedic expression, Lorena's marriage and life spiral crazily out of control.  Klein's treatment of female discontent, the evolving frustrations of housewife life, sexuality, friendships and marital infidelity are astoundingly right on key.<br />The novel, however, belongs to Cassie, and it is through the child's eyes that we fully recognize the author's talents.  The fissures, ultimately growing into yawning chasms, which lay bare the dissolution of her family weigh heavily on Cassie.  She questions herself constantly, wondering if her gift of perception is really hereditary nuttiness, pondering why her friend's &quot;weird&quot; family is cohesive and loving while her &quot;normal&quot; family is painfully distorted, probing presciently into her father's morose loss of purpose and her mother's near infantile self-absorption.  Cassie's introduction to sex, whether it be from her test-pattern visions of the late twentieth-century's blatant use (and abuse) of sexuality to her anguishing over her first bra are done with incredible wit and compassion.  How Cassie introduces Michael Jackson's moonwalk to her Chattanooga Choo-Choo bound mother is literally sidesplitting.<br />I hope &quot;Test Pattern&quot; finds the widest reading audience, although readers over the age of 45 will gain particular pleasure savoring the author's recreation of the impact tv had on our lives in the 1950s.  This skilled, probing and kind novel will undoubtedly be translated into a film, one in which the essential truths will reveal themsleves even without the aid of a test pattern.	2001-03-06

Possessing a very readable cadence and giving evidence of an author comfortable with the genuine grief and questions a breaved husband and father would ask, the novel rings true throughout, even if the events described seem improbable and, at times, unbelievable.<br />For what is more unbelievable than having a young woman succumb to cancer; what is more compelling that having her surviving spouse constantly ponder the significance of his newly minted grief, of the impact of her death on his two beloved (and beautifully described) children and of the absolute need of all of us to grasp what we can of fleeting happiness while we are alive.  This moving novel has many virtues, but the constant questioning, the ever-present doubts, the ubiquitous ruminations about the ethics of life are the paramount strengths of the novel.  Mr. Jones does not compromise either personal or artistic integrity with pat answers; indeed, Porter Ellis is a completely plausible character, and one cannot help but love him even more by the conclusion of &quot;After Lucy.&quot;<br />I received the distinct impression that the author has great affection for his characters  --  from the compelling portraits he draws of Porter's children to the stoned-out and otherworldly contentment of the commune inhabited by Greatful Deadheads.  The stony reserve of his parents-in-law, the detached and near-parasitic observations of Porter's brother, the marvelously detailed personality of the used-car salseman  --  all are drawn with precision and humanity.  For those of us who have suffered through the untimely death of a family member and for those of us who need to envision the possibilities of life when the clouds of death dull our ability to see and smile,  &quot;After Lucy&quot; will remain an enduring literary legacy of courage and hope.	2001-03-01

The briskly-told narrative features a genuinely bright and attractive Harvard undergraduate co-ed whose summer experiences as a research assistant reveal to her both the unbelievably callow nature of her idealized boyfriend and her own sense of potential as a human being.  The feminist themes of searching for authentic identity, rejecting of restrictive stereopyical roles, learning to rejoice in one's chosen sexuality, battling to create genuine relationships based on equality receive due treatment.  One cannot help for have a sense of hope for the novel's protagonist, Bronwen.  Despite all these attributes, &quot;The Girl...&quot; is an unaffecting and boring read.<br />Make no mistake about it:  this is a thoroughly flawed novel.  The writing, put simply, is terrible.  Riddle's style is unbelievably simplistic and unimaginative; it even lacks the energy of a page-turning potboiler.  Her characters have no dimension, and, sadly, devolve into stereotypes; characters becomes caricatures, and when her principal actors lose their credibility, the novel loses its ability to persuade and move the reader.  For example, Bronwen's mentor, Felix, despite his respect for her abilities, invariably wears the food he always seems to be literally stuffing into his mouth.  Her lover, Eric, is so outrageously sexist and domineering that one would wonder what possible reasons Bronwen would have offered to explain her three-year relationship with him.<br />It is ironically unfortunate that Ms. Riddle selected Harvard as the setting for her novel.  Although her admirable intent was to universalize the discontent felt by the privileged Bronwen, the novel truly lacks the ability to translate the anguish of the &quot;best and brightest&quot; to those who could not imagine the Harvard experience.  When it could have elevated itself to a genuinely significant exploration of feminist consciousness, &quot;The Girl...&quot; borders on the irrelevant.	2001-02-25

Treating, at times with great sensitivity and genuine insight, the traumatic childhood of protagonist Vincent Torno, &quot;The Inland Sea&quot; is at its best when analyzing the corrosive impact of a controlling father and emotionally unstable mother.  The novel flounders badly as it disjointedly chronicles the experiences of the adult protagonist; indeed, all the empathy created by Varni in the first half of the novel dissolves.  Sadly, I discovered that I had much more sympathy for Vincent's siblings than I did for him; even his mother's erratic behavior seemed more believable than the effete disdain the struggling writer Vicent expressed towards his family.<br />The second half of the book is emotionally repetitious, and this flaw derives largely from the structure of the novel.  &quot;The Inland Sea&quot; is a collection of purportedly interrelated short stories; Part One, &quot;Innocence&quot; succeeds.  Part Two, &quot;Experience&quot; despeately needs editing and rewriting.  A more observant editor would have taken Mr. Varni to task for his style, as well.  The author clearly values words (and for this love of the language, I praise his efforts), but his writing deteriorates from crisp, elegant prose to pretentious, overblown flights of vocabulary.  Really, how many times does one need to use the word &quot;quotidian&quot; before it is overworked?<br />I had hoped I would like this novel more than I did; for &quot;The Inland Sea&quot; has several strengths.  Mr. Varni's treatment of parental abuse is excellent; his descriptions of the northern San Joaquin Valley are exceptionally accurate.  I respect the integrity with which he drew the characters of Vincent's brother Paul and sister Mary.  Yet, all of these virtues melted away in what became a lifeless and unaffecting second half of the novel.	2001-02-23

Stern paints a vivid picture of Simone, whose mothering skills mirror the venomous pressures and arid emotional wasteland of her own childhood.  Simone is so repressive and begruding of her daughter's right to a life that, at times, it appears that she could not be more deliberate in her emotional abuse.  Silvie, in turn, at a very early age, deliberately withdraws from her mother and builds such an anguished anger and sense of disappointment with her circumstances that she refuses to call her mother any other name than Mimi.<br />The central conceit of the novel turns around Simone's teen-age &quot;relationship&quot; with Elvis Presley, a &quot;date&quot; whose scope is never completely determined but whose impact on the dissatisfied Simone grows and distorts her own ability to live as a functional adult.  Simone's discontent is the central fact of her life.  &quot;For a long time, I liked being married, the routine, the security.  But then it was the late sixties...and there I was in the suburbs, just planning a week of dinner and making them.&quot;  The adult daughter, Silvie (whose own name, incidentally, is a semi-anagram of Elvis), understood &quot;her discontent, the discontent of all women caught between the work of staying home and raising children and the larger work of the world.&quot;<br />Stern's masterful talent of characterization reveals itself fully through Silvie, a sensitive and inquisitive child who bears the brunt of her mother's smoldering fury.  How should a child respond to a parent who insists the child develop her talents, but once expressed, elicits a competitive anger from the very adult she yearns to please?  Silvie decides to withdraw, to finish in second place, to acquiesce to her mother.  This tremendously affecting character pushes her sadness &quot;down into that tight little bead no one could see, filling the space with emptiness, nothingness...I feared I lacked a self.&quot;<br />&quot;Another Song&quot; is not just about the evolving relationship between a mother and her daughter.  This deeply reflective novel also treats the issues of insanity, suicide, depression, divorce, existential anguish and terminal illness.  Never forgotten is the humanity of the central characters, and that compassion animates Stern's ability to make even a Simone a character about whom we care.

Set in the unadorned southern Appalachians during one transforming summer, the novel intertwines three disparate narratives into a seamless unity.  The narratives alternate, ultimately connecting the protagonists to each other and ever more closely to their environment.<br />&quot;Prodigal Summer,&quot; above all else, is an exploation of the idea of ecosystems.  Beneath each character and conflict is the central theme of interdependence and biological/emotional mutuality.  &quot;Predators&quot; features a proud, lonely woman whose intense defense of coyotes underscores not only her acknowledgement of the biological imperatives of predation but her joyous discovery of her own capacity (both biological and emotional) for companionship and love.  Deanna Wolfe emerges as a dominant character, a truly modern champion of the visible and unseen bonds which link us to our living world.  &quot;Moth  Love&quot; explores the coming-of-age of another fine protagonist, Lusa Maluf Landowski, whose premature widowhood compels her to develop both the intellectual and emotional skills to understand the human ecosystem of her suspicious and alien in-laws.  My favorite narrative, &quot;Old Chestnuts,&quot; features two keenly-etched older characters, the strikingly independent and vibrant Nannie Rawley and her antagonist, the straight-laced and emotionally wizened Garnett Walker.  Kingsolver's depiction of Walker's mind and her remarkable talent with dialect make this narrative alone worth the price of the book.<br />You cannot help but become friends with this book.  The author's numerous botanical and animal descriptions are exceptionally well done; her characters - to a person - are utterly real and compelling.  Laced within this beautifully paced book are lengthy discussions of ideas:  biological determinism vs. human intervention, the meaning of family, animal/plant ..., the significance of place, the human search for meaning.  <br />After reading &quot;Prodigal Summer,&quot; you will surely know more of the natural world, but, you will also come away with a more profound identification with our universal quest for understanding our place in this majestically interdependent planet.	2001-02-06

Set in the physical and emotional wasteland outside Las Vegas, the novel chronicles the unspooling impact of a vehicular homicide on the lives of the protagonist, Neil Garvin, and his controlling father.  Watt's pacing is impressive, and the novel gathers strength as it progresses.  By the time I has reached the final day of the three days elapsed since the homicide, I felt completely immersed in the inner dynamics of Neil's emotions and the tense outcome of the criminal investigation following the victim's disappearance.  Because the author invests so much of the novel with moral universals (What are our responsibilities when innocent blood is shed?  What limits are there to friendship and family ties?),  transendent familial values (loyalty, love, and loss), and overwhelming emotion (fear, anger and betrayal), &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; will remain with the reader long after completion.<br />Star quarterback Neil Garvin appears to have it all.  The son of handsome but aloof sheriff Chester Garvin, Neil lives an emotionally crippled life.  Plagued with questions about his mother's abrupt departure from his life when he was but a child, Neil at once envies friends whith coherent families but never allows himself to share his most intimate feelings with anyone.  Despite his academic talent, Neil elects to play the fool in class, drink heartily with his pampered football cohorts and seethe with quiet anger over his father's fascination with Neil Diamond.  The Las Vegas setting skews his view of women, and with the absence of any stable woman in his life, he is left with his father's predatory attitude as his model of relationships.<br />Watt's characterizations are superb.  Neil's father possesses wrath and anger which the author uses to advance the narrative and ultimately explain the development of Neil's character.  Neil's best friend, Reed, comes to symbolize fealty and innocence; his evolution as sacrificial lamb explores the limits of friendship.  Even minor characters, such as the school principal/football coach (whose respectable venality contrasts nicely with the jarring and blatant corruption of Las Vegas), are drawn with precision and present themselves as utterly believable.<br />&quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; is Alan Watt's first novel.  With this impressive debut under his belt, Mr. Watt must know there is an audience eagerly awaiting his next work.	2001-01-27

This extraordinarily well-crafted series of interlocking short stories, treating the experiences of Dana, the daughter of two survivors, compels the intellectual and emotional attention of the reader.  For this novel is an excursion into geographic, temporal and existential displacement.  We come to perceive life through Dana's eyes, a prescient child who begrudgingly accepts the precarious balance of her life and her parents' perceptions of survival - that a false step leads to abyss, that being Jewish in the post-Holocaust world poses terrible ethical quandires unknown and of no concern to the outside world, that present childhood carries the unfathomable weight of the past, of generations obliterated, of families literally disappearing.  The author, Judith Kalman, has produced a dazzling, memorable and significant first novel.<br />Dana Weisz is no ordinary protagonist.  She shoulders the seemingly herculean task of being a child of survivors, one a proud, defiant mother whose integrity provides strength to Dana, the other, a once-aristocratic, now-humbled father whose quiet, &quot;mysterious&quot; love provides comfort and identity.  At once, Dana senses her very existence as a replacement for her murdered half-sister but feels guilty even living a &quot;normal&quot; life, perceiving her own &quot;normal&quot; concerns as superfluous to her parents, given the trauma they have experienced.<br />To be Jewish under these circumstances produces its own internal ambivalence.  &quot;What good had it brought any of them being Jewish...[Name] one time it ever proved an advantage to be Jewish.&quot;  When her parents aggressively promote academic prowess in her older sister, Lillian, they claim:  &quot;Withyour brains...there is nothing you can't do.&quot;  Dana responds that anything is easy &quot;if your standard was being gassed, tortured or stripped of everything you hold dear; the rest would seem a breeze.&quot;  Kalman is at her best when she describes Dana's devastating encounter with contemporary Jewish indifference (circa 1965) to the Holocaust.  Dana's experiment in Sabbath school results in her being profoundly insulted by her Jewish classmates who make crass jokes about the Holocaust when they examine a Life magazine twenty-year retrospective.<br />Judith Kalman's stirring narrative alone, which encompasses three generations of history and three distinct geographic settings,  distinguishes this novel.  But Ms. Kalman peppers her stories with sentences about the Holocaust that hit home very, very hard.  This rather compact novel has unbelievable impact.  It is not an easy or quick read; it forces the reader to stop, to ponder, to question, to try to understand.  The author serves both history and memory admirably.	2001-01-25

Divorce, alcohol addiction, domestic violence, ruined trust and unethical business practices compete with dancing in kitchens, genuine affection, teen-age debauches and waterskiing buck naked.  Richard, the son, witnesses the dissolution of his parents' marriage; Richard, the husband, participates in the deterioration of his own marriage, and Richard, the father, considers exactly what his own son, Fisher, will remember about the chaos of his own early life.<br />Dale Ray Phillips is a fine writer, and his style encompasses sympathy for his characters and wisdom as to their circumstances.  He describes his characters:  &quot;A people like mine were not pleasure-fearing Pilgrims, nor the landed aristocracy of the Virginians who would write the Constitution...We became whatever the new landscape required:  reluctant but rum-fortified revolutionary soldiers; willing purveyors of smallpox-infested blankets...traders of horses and human flesh.&quot;  These &quot;owners of damaged dreams&quot; don't stumble through life; they make war on it.  They love hard, recklessly, and without consequence.  Their unions, emotional, familial or sexual, are intense and unlasting.  They lie, cheat and steal with abandon.  But, Philipps makes them appealing to us.  Richard, his failed father, his emotionally-damaged mother, his frustrated wife Lisa  --  all of them contain that quality of humanity which ultimately bonds them to us.  The author provides the best description of his novel:  &quot;I wish these wer the stories of people who cavorted more with happiness than with the moments from which they needed rescue...All my people have ever aspired toward was a place where the geography of ourselves madesense.&quot;<br />My sole reservation of the novel derives from the disjointed, and, at times, repetitive nature of the prose.  Rather than evolving as a unity, the novel is a bit too episodic, and lacks the cohesiveness of other intgegrated short-story novels.  However, this criticism does not diminish my respect for the author nor for the incredibly sensitive portrait he has created for a segment of our population often ridiculed, but seldom understood.	2001-01-21

These three virtues coalesce in a novel which examines the horrific consequences of an unintended homicide, done by ten-year old Danny Horvath on his hyperkinetic next-door-neighbor, Eddie Nova.  Told in three separate voices  --  Danny,  his mother Nancy and Eddie's father Frank all reveal themselves  --  &quot;A Boy in Winter&quot; capably joins other contemporary novels which explore the impact of trauma on the lives of otherwise honorable, but ordinary, people.  As Chernoff wisely comments, this wrenching event eliminates the possibility of an anonymous life from its three central characters, all interwoven by love and affliction.<br />The author is at her best when she delves into the psychological consequences of unintended disaster and furtive love.  The disaster, of course, is the unintentional homicide.  However, the ruins of conscience and possibility pervade the lives of Danny, Nancy and Frank.  Wracked by guilt and responsibility, the three wrestle with both imagined and unwarranted responsibility.  Danny's written narrative of his life, in my judgment, is the strongest aspect of the novel.  Equally significant is the illicit relationship constructed between Nancy and Frank.  What began as a solid friendship between next-door neighbors blossoms into what appears to be a genuine love affair.  Permeating the relationship is its supposed secret nature; Chernoff delights in asking us who else knows about the affair and what significance that knowledge has on the participants and observers.<br />The writing is taut and direct; the plot is subservient to the central thrust of the novel  --  the need to understand the consequences of unexpected loss on the human heart.  As we watch the characters struggle with their sense of isolation (both physical and emotional) and their burdens of responsibility, we gainnew insights into the significance of love and the possibility of a newly-minted future.	2001-01-18

This is an elegant, direct novel, written from the point-of-view of the ten-year old who is just beginning to glimpse at the challenges and perplexing questions with which adults grapple throughout their lives.  It is a poignant novel as well, reminding us that simple truths which revolve around family life ring majestically and timelessly.  It is a testimonial to the dignity of the human condition, as well, as the novel's protagonist, his mother and her three brothers (who become surrogate fathers to Jim) understand, without ever saying so, that a strong family can withstand poverty, deprivation, and even the most cruel circumstance...the loss of a husband and father.<br />Earley's style is somewhat epigramatic, each chapter containing not only action which advances the plot, but a moral epiphany that encourages Jim's social and personal growth.  These growing awarenesses, however, are not pat or false in emotional tone.  Jim's three uncles assume their responsibilities to their sister and her son with quiet dignity and resolve; Jim's mother has suffered terribly with the loss of her one love in life, and in a series of remarkable scenes and letters, she shows her commitment to her life's decisions with enormous impact.<br />Jim, too, must confront some of the baser parts of his personality.  When competitive drive leads him to become arrogant and at times insensitive to the needs of others, his uncles, by word and action, instruct him to the ways of modesty and interdependence.  As well, Jim is forced to confront family ghosts and the spectre of polio directly, but only when his family considers him both ready and required to do so.<br />I think &quot;Jim the Boy&quot; could be read by both children and adults with equal, but incredibly different results.  It isa novel with universal appeal and impact.	2001-01-11

The author, Beverly Lowry, writes with extraordinary precision and care; she creates both mental and physical landscapes so precisely etched and meticulously envisioned that the reader often will take pause to reflect on the numerous possibilities engendered by these emotional and environmental landscapes.  This novel deserves a very wide audience.<br />Darwing on several established literary traditions, Ms. Lowry uses a central character (Lolly Ray Lasswell) to permit us to examine the texture of life in the ironically-named small town of Eunola.  Reminiscent of Sherwood Anderson's &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; and of William Faulkner's Southern charcterizations, &quot;Come Back Lolly Ray&quot; mercilessly dissects the lives of the citizens of this emotionally barren city.  Lolly Ray, virginal and untouchable, comes to represent, unwillingly and unknowingly, the ultimate symbol of white Southern purity.  Her &quot;abandonment&quot; of an unspoken compact with the town propels the plot of the novel.  Her parents, Frank and Lucille, symbolize the terrible tensions and unresolved conflicts not only particular to the white South in the 1950s but to unfulfilling marriages regardless of time or place.  Other characters, whether they be the town abortionist or the village idiot, the elegant-gone-to-seed cotton aristocrat or the slightly-touched matriarch living in isolation with happy abandon, are sketched with evocative detail and unusual empathy.<br />Above all else, however, &quot;Come Back Lolly Ray&quot; is a writer's novel.  Now a professor at George Mason University, Beverly Lowry demonstraters, on every page, a profound respect for the written word.  Lush with visual and emotional imagery, her novel requirespatience.  For those who can afford a provocative and disturbing view of small-town life and who do not feel the need to rush through a novel whose themes have been explored countless times in our national literature, &quot;Come Back Lolly Ray&quot; will remain in their memories long after having read the book.	2001-01-06

The son of a reprobate father (who is suffused with his own private suffering at the loss of his wife some seven years earlier), the fifteen-year old Meely LaBauve absolutely enchants the reader with his comic, tragic and courageous antics.  Told through the eyes of the protagoinst, the novel's use of cajun bayou dialect and direct dialogue enchances its credibility.  I found myself utterly captivated by Meely's character and deeply moved by the predicaments encountered, faced and surmounted.  As well, the novel is drop-dead funny, and you will find yourself laughing out loud through most of the book.<br />Wells seems to have been able to combine elements of To Kill of Mockingbird (sensitivity to racial injustice and the need to combat racism), the novels of Farrol Sams (it ain't the size of the dog that counts) and the enduring tragi-comic view of Mark Twain's Huck Finn.  Readers will encounter life as lived on the periphery in the cajun bayous of Louisiana; Meely's forced independence (he too suffers real pangs of loneliness in the wake of his mother's death) is countered beautifully by his social environment  --  one which contains a truly mendacious schoolyard bully, an African-American teen-aged woman who introduces him to the delights of &quot;heaven,&quot; and teachers, whose commitment to education in 1961 include liberal dosages of corporal punishment.<br />Great novels must resonate with humanity and inspire us to envision communities based on tolerance and respect.  My late father once called me his &quot;podnah,&quot; and when the Meely's dad uses that phrase...well, more than just memories come to mind.  Mr. Wells has made a small part of Louisiana his universe, and that universe has become my own. So, &quot;podnah,&quot; spend a few hours with Melly LaBauve and discover how Ken Wells has crafted a truly great novel.	2001-01-01

This talmudic treatment of the themes of Holocaust memory, personal revenge, legal retribution and the age-old conflict between legality and morality has the ring of truth, and I feel that readers will be richly rewarded as they read this very fast-paced, stimulating novel.  I have only one reservation which inhibited me from giving the highest rating to the novel; it is written in a &quot;potboiler&quot; type of fashion, and the style is not as sophisticated as other novelists of the Holocaust.  I may be doing Mr. Dershowitz a disservice, however, as I also presume that he wrote this novel for a wide-audience.  The novel comes, altogether, with a high recommendation.<br />The greatest strength of Just Revenge is its serious treatment of one of the central questions of the Holocaust:  How can we (as individuals and as a society) continue to ignore the reality that perpetrators of the most heinous genocide in history have escaped punishment, and worse yet, live gracious lives?  An even more troubling question looms for Holocaust survivors who, as Mr. Dershowitz explains, suffered a complete breakdown of the social contract  --  government not only failed to protect their famillies but also refused to punish those who committed mass murder.  How can these survivors translate the need for social condemnation and punishment (retribution) with the personal need for righting wrongs (revenge)?  <br />These extremely important questions find generous philosophical as well as legal treatment in Just Revenge.  Mr. Dershowitz's alter-ego, the remarkably talented Abe Ringel, leads us through a kidnapping and murder trial in which Holocaust survivor Max Menuchen relives his past and comes to grips with a confrontation with the murderer of his family.  The characters are not as fully rendered as I would have liked, but Mr. Dershowitz did not intend for his characters to overwhelm ideas.	2000-12-28

Told with naturalistic detail and through rough-hewn soldier dialogue, Andrew Huebner's horrific portrait of the final episodes of our nation's genocidal actions against its indigenous peoples will repel many readers searching for something redemptive about this calculated slaughter.  The novel's three protagonists, one of whom, incidentally, is the author's great-great grandfather, follow similar moral paths.  Their early naivete stripped by observation and repulsive participation in the butchering of defenseless Indians, the three undergo a metamorphosis of sorts, ultimately resulting in conscience/empathy which alterately manifests as compassion, identification, and/or madness.<br />Blood courses in this angry and reproachful book.  Unlike the cleansing effect abolitionist John Brown predicted and Abraham Lincoln verified as national pennance for the sin of slavery, the blood shed by Indians has no spiritual value; this racist murder is moraly indefensible and outrageous.  United States soldiers summarily execute defenseless women and children, and attribute (with remarkable psychological projection) savagery to the very victims of our own cruelty and amorality.  Co-existence simply is not an option.  Removal  --  extermination  --  is the process by which a white culture validates its own manifest destiny.<br />To read this novel and to absorb its overwhelming condemnation of our past will require resolve.  But, make no mistake, Huebner's novel reminds us that real people, not some faceless policy-makers, did the killing.  Our land, soaked with shame, is truly American by Blood.	2000-12-27

I regret not having read this moving and provocative novel earlier in my life; I know its themes of self-discovery, conflicted Jewish identity and Americanization would have encouaged both identification and introspection.  I am astonished that high schools today do not include this as an essential core text (instead opting to use F. Scott Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby, also published in 1925 as a paradigmatic novel).  Yezierska's novel has the ring of truth to it, resonating with such crucial themes as self-awareness, cultural marginalization of immigrants, loss and recovery of ethnic identity, feminist discontent and awakening sexuality.  In my mind, Sara Smolinsky has far more to teach us about the American Dream than Jay Gatsby.  Yet, the prevailing literary criticism lionizes the WASP world-view of Fitzgerald and essentially disregards the Jewish/immigrant sensibilities of Yezierska.<br />The novel is uncommonly accessible.  Dialogue carries much of the action; the chapters could be read as independent short stories, and internal soliloquies provide us with the opportunity to test our own judgments against those of the earnest and self-actualizing Sara Smolinsky.  The suffocating but omniscient presence of her tyrannical father best represents Sara's constant confrontation with conflict.  The dilemmas provided by the father-daughter relationship ring with universal truths even though the setting is particular to the Hester Street Easter European Jewish experience.  I know that my Latino, Asian, and Pacific Islander students could easily translate this novel, some  three generations old, into their own experiences.<br />The Persea Books edition owes its existence to the admirable efforts of Professor Alice Kessler-Harris, whose exceptional introductory forewards are worth the price of the edition alone.  Professor Kessler-Harris sheds light not only on Yezierska's tumultuous life but provides a scholarly discussion of the significance of the novel.	2000-12-27

Set in the bitter winter of 1943, the novel's admirable protagonists struggle not only for physical survival at the Tule Lake Relocation Camp, but attempt to live with decency, community values and individual morality.  The novel's unusual perspective derives from its focus on Denton Jordan, a white conscientious objector married to a Jew.  Jordan's sense of justice and empathy compel him to work with the displaced and despised Japanese-Americans (Nisei) and Japanese resident aliens (Issei).  He lives a morally conflicted life, unsure of his own commitment to pacifism and wavering in his marriage.  Exhausted and overwhelmed by a repressive camp administration and challenged by a surging and angry minority of prisoners who are abrasively challenging the very nature of their confinement, Jordan is a tremendously affecting character.  The author's motivation to write derives directly from her own experience.  Born in Tule Lake (as the first white born in that camp), Marnie Mueller has fashioned the central characters around her mother and father.<br />The novel is well written and the plot derives energy from the exceptional characterizations.  Ms. Mueller's sense of detail and powerful descriptions of the physical nature of winter at Tule Lake combine to give her novel a sense of authenticity and urgency.  My only reservation about this work is its tendency towards melodrama, especially in scenes where Jordan's marriage is disintegrating.  Otherwise, Ms. Mueller's treatment of other signficant themes is superb.  She directs our attention to the frustration articulate Jews felt at the silence of the national government to the Holocaust.  She is wonderful in detailing the terrible inadequacies Jordan and Esther (his wife) carried in the face oftheir quite different childhoods.	2000-12-16

Populated with genuinely interesting and fully-realized characters, Shea's works evoke admiration and understanding, compassion and respect, despair and bittersweet hope.  Her most recent novel, Lily of the Valley, is her best yet as the author not only introduces us to a plucky, determined protagonist in Lily Wilk but shares with us her thoughts on some of the most important themes in literature:  identity, family and love.<br />Situated in western Massachusetts (where Shea continues to live), Lily of the Valley unpretentiously examines the life of frustrated artist and newly-divored Lily Wilk.  We view Wilk through the prism of her profession and calling, painting, and we see her marriage disintegrate.  Shea's considerable abilities reward the reader; one becomes engaged and thoroughly committed to Lily, and we enjoy and suffer with her.  Faulkner once stated that all literature most deal with the &quot;verities of the heart;&quot; Lily of the Valley admirably fulfills this admonition.<br />The writing is engaging; the dialogue delights.  However, Ms. Shea's finest writing is definitional.  Though not breaking any new philosophic grounds on the themes of love and family, her proposals are breathtakingly well written.  The last 15 pages of the novel alone are worth reading as an essay on the notion of family.<br />Universal in impact and exalting the human spirit, Lily of the Valley deserves a wide readership.	2000-12-06

Set in an affluent East-coast suburb, the novel examines portagonist Paul Werth's tumultuous junior year at an exclusive prep school.  Therein exists the weakness of the novel; while attempting to craft a work which explores the universal themes of death, sexuality, and maturation, the author has used a setting with which few Americans can easily identify.<br />I am of the opinion that the F. Scott Fitzgerald age is over, that most Americans simply cannot and will not care about the agonies of relatively wealthy white people when there are the genuine pains and sufferings of us ordinary people which more aptly could serve as the canvas on which a sensitive author could create art.  Despite the heroic efforts otherwise of the author, the novel's conclusion is predicatable and pat.<br />The work is not without merit, however.  Mr. Herman is at his best where he dissects Paul's relationship with his father and explores the awful dynamics a precipitous death can have on a family.  In numerous scenes, the author fully engages his reading audience and develops a resounding identification with Paul as he comes to grip with an awful loss.  Paul's epiphany about women and love deserves commendation as well.<br />Nevertheless, this novel disappoints, especially with the author's tendency to overwrite and use a vocabulary which would be better placed on a SAT examination.  Why use outlandish language when simpler words would do the trick?	2000-11-27

They will marvel at the technique of introducting a &quot;book-within-a-book&quot; as a means of propelling both the plot-line and examination of character.  I assusme that these same readers will indentify with the flaws and fluctuations of the friendship between two women, Deborah and Toby.  <br />I am not one of them.  I read this novel awaiting revelations and depth.  Instead, page after boring page of petulant, self-absorbed characters, lamenting their marriages, their children, their bosses, their teaching skills, and, most importantly, their selves.  Enough, already!  <br />Alice Mattison even borrowed from one of the oldest contrivances in literature, the heroine of a borrowed novel actually appearing in real life  --  to complicate (of course) and ultimately, if reluctantly and unwittingly, elucidate the theme of acceptance and forgiveness.  I think this would be forgiven were the novel written for lovers of fantasy.  But this novel purports to instruct us on the intricacies of friendship and the foibles of modern relationships.<br />The only character worth remembering is the narrator if novel-within-a-novel.  At least she attempts to deal with the notion of Americanization, radical politics, anti-semitism, anarchy, free love, and family tension.  Ultimately, however, even Miriam's sensitiblity is lost in this sea of repetitive self-worry and concern.	2000-11-25

I cannot tell you the number of times you will pause while reading this extraordinarily sensitive and profoundly moving life-story.  Some of your pauses will feature your face wreathed in smiles, for Janisse Ray's &quot;Ecology of a Cracker Childhood&quot; is a celebration of both place and family, and her finely-delineated family sketches and gloriously-rendered anecdotes and teeming with respect and affection for her family.  Other pauses will find you, I am sure, hands on knees, weeping.  For there is great pain in this book as well...the pain of a place that is gradually disappearing, the pain of understanding your place in that place, the pain of coming to grips with the flaws of your heritage.  <br />One reviewer, Wes Jackson, said, &quot;Janisse Ray is a role model for countless future rural writers to come.&quot;   I believe that he understates Ms. Ray's importance.  To tell the truth, she is a role model, plain and simple.  It is my hope that this stirring memoir will vault her into our nation's consciousness and conscience.  This daughter of a Cracker junkyard owner has a significant message to tell us, and her language is simply remarkable.  Her verbal imagery is astounding; her precise descriptions  --   of humans, flora and fauna  --  are models of elegance.<br />I am willing to bet that there are more than a few readers who could only imagine the possible union of Ms. Ray and Rick Bragg (&quot;All Over but the Shoutin'&quot;).  These two white Southerners have much to teach us about family, conscience, commitments and reverence of place.  <br />&quot;Ecology of a Cracker Childhood&quot; will emerge as one of our century's most important works.

Indeed, the protagonist Louisa Barrett seems to symbolize both the repression women encountered in a Victorian culture and the incipient hopes of a feminist who confronts the evils of both personal and systemic sexism.  The author's knowledge of (and affection for) Buffalo brings an even deeper passion to the work.<br />However, the novel's greatest strength, I feel, is not in its thoroughly-fleshed characters, but in its treatment of personal powerlessness and its understanding of the compromises people of principle must pay in order to protect those dear to them.  The wealthy in &quot;City of Light&quot; are a smug, offensive group, content to manipulate the lives of thousands of poorer (often recently-arrived) immigrant families for power and prestige.  The only exception to this dessicated group of power-hungry elitists is the father of the aptly-named Grace, Tom Sinclair.  Otherwise, Belfer does us a tremendous serivce in painting the upcoming story of the twentieth century:  corporate capitalism gnawing away at any semblance of moral authority and reasoning.  I left the novel repulsed at the ugly barren nature of these &quot;lords of Buffalo.&quot;<br />In addition, Ms. Belfer treats the theme of moral compromise brilliantly.  Without detailing the core dilemma of the novel, I can assure the reader that he/she will discover Louisa as a completely believable character, constantly measuring her desire to lend her voice to moral outrage against her need to protect a persona beloved by her.  Her constant capitulations to social evil so that she may maintain a morally pure relationship with the focus of her life earns her a sense of nobility.<br />This is a solid, imporant work of literature, but I join those voices who believe that &quot;City of Light&quot; tends to ramble and the characters may come close to caricature in some instances.  Nevertheless, these flaws are more than balanced by Ms. Belfer's beautiful language and compelling treatment of theme.	2000-11-13

Its central characters, all proud Southerners, have genuinely distinctive traits, and each finds a way to bring your sympathies to them.  He beautifully evokes place as well; the South becomes real  --  not a series of stereotypes.  His anger at the second-class citizenship the South has in the national personality rings true throughout the book, though his prose tends to be a bit purple at times.  His treatment of the themes of personal discovery, worth, and purpose is outstanding.<br />Early in the book, one of the characters describes the &quot;threat of selling one's dignity for money.&quot;  Each of the characters confronts that threat, and though each does engage in activities which otherwise would degrate their characters, they emerge stronger and unscathed.  It is their unwillingness to bend to the hypocritical and overly-materialistic mannerisms of the national culture which make them such fascinating characters.<br />The book has several weaknesses, however.  It is overly melodramatic, and the sections where the action is completely believable are offset by passages where the antagonists are so pathetically stereotyped that they beg belief.  <br />These flaws do not interfere with the novel, which is a pleasure to read.  It comes with a strong recommendation.	2000-10-31

It isone of the most powerful and affecting works of fiction I have read inrecent years.  Thematically rich, with characters who are so real youimagine them sitting with you as you read, the novel literallyembraces us with the almost desperate ambivalence and profoundemotional tensions the compelling protagonist, Tamara Anderson, feels.That this is Ms. Willis' first novel makes the achievement all themore stunning.  Rest assured, this work will find its way on therequired reading lists of both secondary and university readinglists.<br />In a seamless fashion, Sarah Willis has managed to convey thelife of an anachronistic family in the mid-1950s with accuracy andempathy.  In an era which celebrated conventional nuclear families,the Andersons are peripatetic wanderers, the journeys fueled by afather whose need for fresh landscapes to fuel his painting requiresthe family to move from house to house each spring.  Indeed,Ms. Willis explores the definitions of family and home throughout,both in her evocation of place and her contrasting the Andersons withtheir cross-street neighbors.  These neighbors, whosereligion-centered lives contrast with the rational/scientific mind ofTamara's mother, provide both ballast and turmoil to Tamara'sworld-views.<br />In addition to the author's sensitive treatment of theaforementioned themes, she is at her very best in dealing with thewrenching illness of Tamara's mother and the protagonist's discoveryof her own body and growing awareness of herself as a sexual being.The descriptions of Tamara and her partner-in-discovery, Rusty, arealone worth the reading of the novel.  Ms. Willis poses many seriousquestions: What is the best way for a family to handle medicaltragedy? What responsibility to parents have in guiding theirchildren?

The protagonist, a capable mental health professional involved in an unravelling romantic relationship, confronts a childhood rife with a sterile home life, a nascent awakening of his homosexuality, and a series of traumatic events which underscore his feelings of powerlessness and guilt.<br />Swanson draws his characters compassionately; each has literary integrity and authenticity.  Parts of this slim novel are carried by powerful dialogue (in many ways reminiscent of Hemingway); other sections contain absolutely elegant imagery (as if you were reading a prose poem).<br />For those readers who lament that modern American male authors lack ability to describe and analyze relationships, The Boy in the Lake will be a pleasant reminder that dissecting the heart is not exclusively a female literary occupation.	2000-10-20

Tova Mirvis has permitted us to examine the delicious strengths and corrosive weaknesses of the tightly-knit Jewish Orthodox community of Memphis, Tennessee.  Her atistry derives from the multiplicity of voices and perspectives used in detailing the heroic struggle of the novel's protagonist, Batsheva, to gain a sense of spiritual peace and community while exhibiting behaviors which go against the grain of an established, and ultimately, oppressive community.<br />Mirvis writes with extraordinary insight and compassion, both for Batsheva (whom she clearly respects) and the community (whose stability and values she admires and whose unwillingness to engage in self-examination she condemns).  Batsheva's quests for belonging and religious authenticity become scapegoats for the other women in the community, who feel threatened by Batsheva's religious spiritualism and her uncanny ability to communicate with their daughters.<br />Those who extol ritual over authentic spiritual commitment may be uncomfortable with this novel.  Mirvis herself writes about Orthodox Judaism's move to the right and warns self-satisfied members of her community that repressing young women's desires  to know more of the world has more dangerous consequences than permitting them the right of discovery.  Those who see themesleves in the Memphis community will receive the greatest pleasure, for the author has written a particular novel with universal implications.  <br />Rest assured, you will immediately call other family members even before finishing this wonderful novel and urge them to savor the many gifts of Tova Mirvis.	2000-10-10

Preempting the Holocaust is a warning, an interpretation, and a &quot;re-visioning&quot; of that horrific event.  Using his considerable skills in oral history, Professor Langer has little hopeful or comforting to say; in fact, he constantly admonishes us against interpreting the Holocaust through modern Christian values.  Thus, he argues that there is nothing redemptive about the suffering of the victims of the Holocaust, that superficial analyses of many survivors' accounts could have future students blaming the victim instead of the perpetrators, and that those who suffered from the Holocaust relive the experience in what he terms &quot;durational&quot; time.<br />I found Professor Langer's theses convincing and distressing.  I share with him his praise of Daniel Goldhagen's assertion that hatred can be used as the means by which we understand the motivation of the killers.  Indeed, I think his introductory essay was the strongest of the collection, for in it, Professor Langer summarizes the conclusions of the following essays.  His assertion that:  &quot;The very image of machinery [the Holocaust as done by a &quot;killing machine&quot;] rather than man as the primary instrument of liquidation tends to absolve individual offenders and obscure the identity and the catalyst of the very culprits who initiated and carried out the crime.&quot;<br />Both scholars and people of conscience would do well to include this volume in their libraries.	2000-10-10
US	50747195	R2X2X7ZDHFJSC5	0688177638	329847956	Battle Creek	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Lasser explores price of victory in touch 'em all novel	Battle Creek joins Bang the Drum Slowly and The Natural in its exploration of the lure and costs of baseball on the American psyche.  Focusing on the final season of generationally-sandwiched head coach Gil Davison, the novelist Scott Lasser is at his best when the themes of competition and success mingle with the tensions engendered in families which do not function well.  His descriptions of his terminally ill father are, to me, the strongest aspect of the novel.<br />In addition, his evocative narrative of actual games reveal a man who knows and respects the beauty of baseball.  Unfortunately, the women who populate his novel are distressingly unidimensional:  either poetically detached or built like centerfolds (with little personality or intelligence to attract them to readers who would prefer &quot;real&quot; women to affected groupies).<br />Nevertheless, I commend the novel for its exploration into the darker sides of our character, our obsessions with winning and our delusions as to how much victory truly means.	2000-09-29

The author, Jim Davidson, deftly inerweaves the present (in which a tormented son despeately attempts to piece together three generations of family tragedy) and the past (in which a compelling narrative of injustice, racism, and personal pain) seamlessly.<br />One of the significant themes of this beautifully-paced first novel is the disgraceful treatment of Native Americans by rapacious industry and racist individuals.  Markus Cottin's quest for knowledge and inner-peace cannot exist without a coming to grips with this aspect of history.  The author has not written a polemic, however; Mr. Davidson's language is elegant, spare and precise.	2000-09-24

Anti-intellectualism and body-breaking  comepte for attention in this tightly written and fatalistic novel.  As I  approached the conclusion, I marveled that the author lived to speak about  his experiences, rueful of the enormous costs he has paid.	1999-11-25
