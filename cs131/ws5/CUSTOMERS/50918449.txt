She lands a job in a local restaurant, and author Frank thrills the reader with descriptions of fluffy biscuits, mouth-watering pound cakes, and seafood in all its glorious paramutations. (I love how Southern novels - and often, plays - seem to incorporate food as such a basic part of their stories. In the South, food is very central to culture. ) As a result of her move, Linda rekindles her relationship with her sister, strengthens her bonds with her daughters, and finds true love.<br /><br />Some of the characters (and their conversations) are hilarious, particularly Louise (who works at the restaurant), Mimi (Linda's sister) and Linda herself. Linda's two daughters are less developed, but they are not as central to the story, I suppose.<br /><br />Everything does seem to fall into place for Linda with a little too much ease, but a happy ending now and then never killed anyone. I am NOT someone who believes that everything I read (or watch) must mirror life. If it did, where would we find the escapism we're looking for whne we turn to books and movies?	2005-09-05

They bought their farm just as local farmers were selling out, and, struggling constantly to \\"get by,\\" they've always felt like outsiders in their small town. Alice has one true friend in Prarie Center - Theresa. One day, when a stressed-out Alice happens to be babysitting Theresa's children, Theresa's youngest child (Lizzie) drowns in the pond on Alice's farm. Alice feels responsible, and the town seems to judge her.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, Alice is accused of child molestation by one of the boys at her school. She is quickly tried in the court of public opinion and found lacking. The actual legal storm that ensues, however, changes her life and the lives of her family.<br /><br />Despite all of her troubles, I often found it difficult to feel sympathy for Alice. For one thing, she has a volatile relationship with her own children. Her eldest daughter is defiant, and Alice doesn't really know what to do with her. Secondly, Alice is a bit scatterbrained. Although she certainly didn't harm anyone on purpose, her failure to actually watch after Theresa's children did lead to Lizzie's death. Thirdly, she seems very weak. After Lizzie's funeral, Alice couldn't pull herself together. She couldn't get out of bed. She seemed to have no regard for the well-being of her husband or her children.<br /><br />Alice's husband was hard to understand at times, too. He uproots his family to move out onto an unprofitable dairy farm. Then, he of course spends most of his time working on the farm. He neglects his relationship with his wife and his children. Alice has to work as a school nurse to support the family, because of course the farm isn't turning much of a profit.  Then, when Alice is in jail, he canoodles with her best friend! He spends time over at Theresa's house, enjoying the food she cooks and the way she makes him feel.<br /><br />I don't know. It just seemed, at times, that I couldn't relate to the characters at all. The ending felt flat, and I didn't have much sympathy for any of the characters except Theresa. She really got screwed.<br /><br />Also, I didn't read this book quickly.

People spent their time gorging on ribeyes and shunning fresh fruit. What? Then, a colleague of mine dropped a dramatic amount of weight. When I asked her what regimen she was following, she told me she was on the South Beach Diet. I went out and bought this book.<br /><br />The diet emphasizes lean, healthy cuts of meat, poultry, and seafood, and lots of fresh vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and water. It's a perfectly healthy diet, and the doctor who created the diet predicts that anyone following it will lose betwee 8 and 13 pounds in the first two weeks.<br /><br />Well, to be truthful, I didn't have too much weight to lose, but I followed the eating plan meticulously for two weeks, and I even added more physical activity to my schedule. By the end of the two week period, I had lost a GRAND TOTAL of . . . 2 pounds. I could have done that myself, just by cutting back a little more on calories, without the book.<br /><br />So, in all honesty, the diet didn't really work for me. I think that if a person has alot of weight to lose, or if they have poor health habits to begin with, this book is a great tool. Since I already ate pretty healthily, though, and I already tend to work out, I didn't see as dramatic a difference as my colleague.	2005-08-12

Orlean, the author of this book, is a journalist, and the novel definitely reads like a journalist wrote it. First of all, there is no real plot line. This is not a story with a beginning, middle, and end. Rather, it reads like a feature story: an in-depth look at Florida and its history, the society of orchid collectors and hunters, and Orlean's own experiences with John Laroche, the orchid thief of the book's title. (The book was actually born out of a story that Orlean wrote for The New Yorker.)<br /><br />While it can be a bit slow at times, the book offers fascinating insight into several microcosms of Florida. Orlean explores the history of land scheming in the state, the treatment of the Seminole Indians, and the smuggling of plants and animals that occurs in Florida. She also invites the reader to join her in the high-stakes world of orchid collecting, in which one plant might fetch thousands of dollars.<br /><br />Orlean continually refers back to the passion of orchid collectors, characterizing their affinity for the plants as a type of mania. It was interesting to me, though, that Orlean herself experiences a similar mania - that of reporting. About half way through the book, I noticed that Orlean had gone to ALOT of trouble to write The Orchid Thief. She'd moved down to her parents house in Florida. She was driving all over the state of Florida to plant shows, orchid businesses, growers' fairs, etc. She was slogging through the Florida swamp in increasingly hot and buggy weather. She was spending copious amounts of time with John Laroche, a sometimes-irritating personality at best. It was interesting to me that she herself possessed a kind of mania, but that her mania (reporting/her job) is one that's much more acceptable to society. In other words, if you are in love with your job, fine. But if it's flowers you like, well, you're a little off kilter.<br /><br />Anyway, I really enjoyed it, and I do recommend it. It can be a little slow in places, but it's worth forging ahead.but it's worth forging ahead.	2005-08-02

This book isn't quite as much of a page-turner as Drowning Ruth, and I think it's primarily because the characters aren't quite as likable.<br /><br />Here's the skinny on the plot: Margaret, a teacher who has quit her full-time job to write a novel, is lifelong friends with Letty, whose husband recently received a tony job at a very financially-secure museum. Margaret lacks focus and has made little progress on her novel. She feels like a failure, but even more, she dreads letting everyone know that she hasn't succeeded in her Hemingway-esque pursuit. Letty, on the other hand, is a sweet mother who is quickly caught up in the materialistic world of the very wealthy. On a whim, Margaret begins writing about her friend, work that is little more than a re-telling of thinly-veiled reality. As Letty begins to get in over her head, accumulating debt and encountering other financial problems, does Margaret (her supposed friend) warn her? Does she help her get herself out of the mess she's gotten into? NO. Margaret encourages Letty's materialism so that she can keep \\"writing.\\" The whole fiasco ends badly, of course.<br /><br />I really ended up hating Margaret. She was so self-centered and conceited. And the fact is, she couldn't write. But instead of finally admitting that to herself and throwing in the towel, she abused her poor friend so that she could put together what was, in the end, a very mediocre novel.<br /><br />The story is a little depressing, but very good. I had to put it down a few times, just because I knew what heartache was coming for Letty, and I almost couldn't take it! I do recommend it, though.	2005-07-06

Wells introduces the reader to Sidda Lee Walker, a successful New York playwright who has had the misfortune of inadvertently maligning her mother in print. In response, Sidda's mother, Vivi (a mercurial, passionate, dramatic woman), instantly starts cutting Sidda Lee out of her will and destroying all the pictures she has of her daughter.<br /><br />To heal the rift, Vivi sends Sidda Lee a scrapbook, playfully titled \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,\\" to help her daughter understand her better. Through flashbacks, the reader learns of the hardships, joys, and sweet surrenders of Vivi's life. Most of all, the reader learns about the incredible friendship shared by four lifelong friends who have dubbed themselves the Ya-Yas. The flashbacks illustrate their misadventures as well as the remarkable constancy of their relationships with one another. Though Sidda herself isn't privy to the flashbacks, she does come to an understanding that she needn't know everything about her mother in order to love her, forgive her, and enjoy her own life.<br /><br />I thought this was such an atmospheric novel. Wells is adept at describing life in Louisiana: the climate, the food, the landscape. She delineates life in the south very clearly, and it rang true to me.<br /><br />In addition, Wells' characterization's are magnificent. All of the Ya-Yas are distinct and lovable, even though some of them (especially Vivi) commit some pretty atrocious sins throughout the course of the novel. In addition, Sidda Lee is a nice, full character, with hang-ups, insecurities, and an ego of her own. All in all, I really enjoyed this book. I read in about two days.	2005-06-24

I recently finished reading this book, and I'm not sure WHAT to think. The early part of the novel was very interesting to me, as my mother was also very ill as I was growing up, and I could relate to being a young person who suddenly had very adult responsibilities.<br /><br />I think the problem that I had with the book thereafter was that it was just too much. Eggers goes to great lengths to communicate to readers that he's very self-aware, he's very media-savvy, he's always one step ahead of the reader. And while his tangents and stream-of-consciousness writing can be interesting at times, I found it getting stale rather quickly. The book, in some ways, is all about self-analyzation: what Eggers thinks of himself, what he thinks others think about him, what he wants others to think about him. As a reader, I felt like I was under some sort of microscope, with Eggers considering how, with every word I read, I was perceiving HIM. I'm not sure that such conceit makes a worthy read.	2005-06-14

When you're studying an art, like acting, it is sometimes frustrating to hear people talk about \\"craft\\" and \\"technique\\" without getting really specific about what you must actually DO to achieve such things and develop as an artist. People often talk about art as if it is some vague, nebulous, magical thing. And, I guess, it benefits them to talk about it that way. Because then, everyone respects them immensely for being able to do such a thing, and (like a magician) they don't reveal any of their secrets.<br /><br />This book pulls the veil away. While I don't necessarily advocate relying ONLY on this resource (instinct, other techniques, etc., should all be in an actor's bag of tricks), this book provides clear, actionable directions on how to achieve more specificity in your choices as an actor, how to make your characters more focused, and how to deliver more compelling performances. Based on Stanislavsky's method, the book advises embodying each line with action (and tells you how), LISTENING to your stage-mates, and thinking about the physicality of a role (and tells you how).<br /><br />What I like best about this book is that it breaks something complicated, like rendering a complex character, down into manageable things you can do to get yourself there as a performer. Bravo!	2005-04-15

Although I have never understood why, the travel industry seems to have ignored the wealth of things to do here.<br /><br />This book is great because it's extremely detailed and also provides the history (or what I like to call the \\"back story\\") on alot of the sights and attractions in the state.<br /><br />The book divides the state into sections, giving meaty attention to each part of Mississippi. At the end of each section, Kirkpatrick provides a list with contact information for each attraction, hotel, and retail outlet discussed in the section. Bits of state trivia are also interspersed throughout the book in little shaded boxes. This helps to liven up the reading, and is fun and educational, to boot.<br /><br />Living in central Mississippi, I can definitely vouch for the veracity of that section. Kirkpatrick hits all of the highlights (and some of the lowlights!).<br /><br />If you're interested in visiting the REAL Mississippi, not just the casinos and the antebellum homes (though Kirkpatrick certainly covers those, too), buy this book.	2005-04-15

Charlotte, the wife of a local preacher, asks Sybil to be her midwife for the delivery of her second baby, and Sybil agrees. However, during delivery, disaster strikes. Phone lines are down, and roads are too icy to navigate. Sybil notices that Charlotte is experiencing a difficult birth, but she can't call anyone for help or take the ailing mother to a hospital. Sibyl must make a choice - perform an emergency C-section to save the child, or allow both child and mother to die.<br /><br />The drama that ensues after Sybil makes her choice pits the medical community against the profession of midwifery. The maelstrom that engulfs Sybil and her family makes for a gripping story. I read this book in one or two sittings, and I was guessing about the outcome until the final pages.<br /><br />The novel gives interesting descriptions about what being a midwife might be like, and I really enjoyed Sybil's passion for her \\"calling\\" and her observations about birth in general. Young Connie (Sybil's daughter, and the narrator of the book), with her penchant for eavesdropping, provides an interesting perspective on the events happening around her.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book. The characters are full, and the plot in engaging. A great story, one that I thought was very original.	2005-04-02

In The Rapture of Canaan, author Sheri Reynolds creates a world inhabited by the disciples of The Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing Wind. Ninah Huff, a young girl and the granddaughter of the church's overzealous preacher, chafes under the isolation and the strict rules of the cult-like community. Reynolds does a wonderful job of slowly building the tension between Ninah and the oppressive community in which she lives.<br /><br />For example, Grandpa Herman's rules stipulate no contact with non-church members, but Ninah wants to talk with an Indian girl going to her school. Grandpa Herman preaches against the temptations of the flesh, but Ninah longs for physical contact with James, her prayer partner. Grandpa Herman collects fines from community members who break his rules, supposedly meteing the money back out to the community at large according to need. Ninah (and other community members) begin to wonder where all that money is going . . .<br /><br />Reynolds creates a very detailed world that is almost a textbook example of cult behavior. But Ninah doesn't always see it that way. In some ways, the lives of the characters are positively joyful. Reynolds does a good job of showing us the complexity of cult behavior in this respect. The characters, particularly Ninah and her grandmother, are rounded and likable. While I don't think it's the main focus of the novel, the plot is adequate. Characterization and description play larger roles, though.<br /><br />My only disappointment in this novel was the ending. I felt that there should have been more of an indication as to what would happen to the community at the conclusion of the novel. While I agree that every novel shouldn't have an ending that ties all the storylines up in a bow, this ending was just a little to close-mouthed for me.	2005-03-19

Schwarz has woven an intricate tale of family, duty, secrecy, and love. Set in the early 1900s, Drowning Ruth explores the entertwined lives of Amanda Starkey, a nurse with a closely guarded secret, and her niece Ruth, who is raised by her aunt Amanda after her own mother drowns.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the pace of the novel is what makes the story so compelling. Schwarz carefully doses out past chapters of the family's lives, interspersed with plot lines occurring in the present. As a reader, I greedily accepted each clue to the past, trying to guess what the ultimate truth of the family's history might be. Schwarz wisely waits to solve the biggest mysteries until the final pages of the novel.<br /><br />The characterization in this novel is masterful. Amanda, Ruth, and Imogene are rich and deep and real. Their choices are conflicted, and their emotions are totally relatable. Schwarz also delights with detailed descriptions of the countryside where the family makes its home - bleak and unforgiving in winter, lush and more kind in the warmer months.<br /><br />A wonderful novel, definitely worth reading.	2005-03-13

It is definitely a page turner, despite its length. One of the reasons I kept reading was that, when I wasn't reading the novel, I was wondering what was going to happen next! The plot moves quickly, driven by the personalities and the foibles of the various characters. The story Golden weaves definitely draws the reader in.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, however, I certainly don't believe that the novel is thin regarding character development, and I definitely do not think that the protagonist, Sayuri, has \\"everything handed to her on a silver platter\\"! Nothing could be further from the truth! Golden, the author, takes great pains to show the reader the harshness of Sayuri's upbringing, and he frequently comments on how difficult the life of a working geisha could be, both before, during, and after World War II.<br /><br />One of the novel's primary strengths is the window into the life of a geisha that it offers. For me, this world was both foreign and fascinating. To learn about the details of dress, hair, custom, and daily life of a geisha in the context of an entertaining story was a welcome part of my experience reading the novel.<br /><br />Several reviewers have also noted that the end of the novel seems contrived or phony. I'll admit that I felt similarly, too, at first. However, I think that the ending in no way diminishes the power of the story. In fact, with the way much of contemporary fiction ends these days, it can be refreshing to hear a \\"happily ever after\\" once in a while.	2005-03-05

Miller does a wonderful job with both plot and character development in this novel, which was a New York Times bestseller and a Ballantine Reader's Circle book. The protagonist, Jo, is finely drawn and very complex. Sometimes I empathized and identified with her and other times I thought she was immensely selfish.<br /><br />A basic plot sketch - Basically, Jo ran away from her \\"safe\\" life as a married teacher when she was young, opting instead for life in a house full of other young people who didn't know about her past. This part of the book is described in a free, easy style that I really enjoyed. Although I didn't grow up during the sixties, I felt as though Miller gave a good picture of what it might have been like. Life in the house ends with a violent crime, and the \\"friends\\" scatter to the winds to live their separate lives. Jo later re-marries, has three daughters, and enjoys a fulfilling job. Her life seems almost idyllic.  Then her past comes back to torment her in the form of an old friend (and her overactive memory/imagination). It is her own selfishness, however, that causes the most trouble for her in the end.<br /><br />I really identified with Jo's intermittent feelings of restlessness; she feels sometimes as if she wants to live more fully, take more risks, to feel more free and passionate about her life. She yearns for the way she felt during her youth. I think everyone feels this way sometimes. But Jo decides to pursue this longing the wrong way, in a way that causes pain to those she loves. I find it interesting that she rarely stops to think about how her words and actions will make her devoted husband feel.<br /><br />Despite not feeling totally sympathetic to Jo's character, I loved the book. The characters seem very real, and I enjoyed reading about them. Based on this novel, I'll definitely read more Miller.	2005-02-27

I read this book when I was first beginning to experience the wonderful world of wine, and it has been a great resource for me. A quick read, the book is organized into chapters on choosing wines at shops and restaurants, where and how wines are made, choosing wine to go with food, and descriptive terms for wine. (They even have pronunciations for wine terms. No more looking stupid at dinner parties!) Also, the book touches on some of the major wine-makers that it pays to be familiar with.<br /><br />I really like the attitude that the authors take towards the subject matter. They seem to think (as I do) that wine is not a snobby subject to learn about. It's about something most of us are already familiar with - what tastes we like and don't like. Easy, huh? They emphasize that wine is to be enjoyed, not agonized over.<br /><br />I like the way the content is interspersed with funny comics, highlighted tips, and even little technical blurbs about wine. (There are also \\"snob alerts\\" throughout the book! They address some of the attitudes self-proclaimed \\"wine experts\\" sometimes express. What a hoot!)<br /><br />All in all, a great read. Based on the book's advice, I bought a small, pocket-sized wine book. When I'm out at a restaurant or party and I taste something I like, I jot it down in the book for future reference. Then, I use the book when I go to the wine shop or when I'm eating out. Great suggestion!	2005-01-26

Morrison creates a town (Medallion, Ohio), and then adds a deeper layer (The Bottom), peopled with an array of very different, very complex characters. Shadrack narrowly misses committing suicide every year. Tar Baby is only in Medallion so that he can drink himself to death and listen to music. Eva had her leg sheared off in order to obtain money, and Hannah seems to bed other women's husbands without the least ill-will towards their marriages.<br /><br />Into this environment, Morrison introduces Sula and Nel, two young girls who find themselves in each other. Sula comes from an unconventional home, where strays are taken in with acceptance. Nel comes from a more proper background that is not without its skeletons in the closet. The girls know each other, don't judge each other, share everything. As they mature, Sula leaves Medallion for a college education and life in some of the big cities of America. Nel marries, has children, and stays in Medallion.<br /><br />When the two women meet again years later, their interactions show the differences between choices sanctioned by society and those that are unconventional. Although I wasn't sure that I even liked Sula by the end of the book, she is reminiscent of an Ayn Rand character. She makes her choices based on an inner compass, and she doesn't care what consequences her \\"reputation\\" may suffer as a result.<br /><br />The book makes interesting comments on the nature of survival, individuality, and friendship. I really enjoyed it, but I did have a hard time sympathizing with Sula at the end of the book. I understand that Morrison may have been trying to make a statement about staying true to oneself, but I thought Sula was arrogant and disloyal in the way she treated Nel, especially after the type of relationship they had shared.	2004-11-11

During the Mexican American War, Thoreau refused at one point to pay his taxes. He felt that the war was unjust, and he didn't want his money supporting a government that he believed was doing unjust things. (He also believed that the war was not the will of the people, as President Polk had declared war without the support of Congress.)<br /><br />The play, which takes place on a simple set that emphasizes the imagination of the audience (and the performers) for props/surroundings, also delves into Thoreau's love for nature and his views on sprituality. (The fact that the set is simple reflects another way that form follows content, as Thoreau encouraged people to turn away from materialism and simplify their lives.) The chief journey in the play is Thoreau's decision to return to the world, rather than remove himself from it.<br /><br />Themes include individuality, the nature of spirituality, marching to one's own drummer (regardless of consequence), the belief that one person can make a difference, the idea of standing on principle/what's right, and the manifestation of the divine in nature and humanity (Transcendentalism).<br /><br />It's a somewhat academic play, about ideas more than about plot (of which there is virtually none), but it reminds us that theatre can inform and instruct us as well as entertain us. Additionally, the subject matter of the play is very topical (public funds for stem cell research? or the war in Iraq?) and is sure to stimulate thought and discussion.<br /><br />The authors of this play (two college professors) demanded that it not be produced on Broadway and, to my knowledge, it never has been. This, I may assume, was their own form of \\"disobedience,\\" as they maintained that a few blocks in Manhattan shouldn't dictate what real theatre is to the rest of the nation. Despite their mandate, however, The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail has been one of the most produced plays in America, enjoying wide circulation in regional theatres and especially on college campuses.as been one of the most produced plays in America, enjoying wide circulation in regional theatres and especially on college campuses.	2004-11-10

Bailey White's book of short stories/narratives that describe crazy relatives and neighbors, interesting experiences with folks traveling through, and the adventures of daily life is a great addition to any reader's collection of southern literature. I particularly loved \\"Computer Class,\\" which tells the tale of two elementary school teachers who skip out on computer training to go to the dog races.<br /><br />White has a tender way of writing about all of her \\"characters.\\" She notes people's eccentricities, but she doesn't judge them or look down on them. In many ways, she seems to delight in all the \\"differences\\" that make people (and the world) interesting. A great read.

It's so easy to pick up burgers on the way home or have pizza delivered after a tough day at the office.<br /><br />But Eric Schlosser has dome some research that may make you think twice about \\"having it your way.\\" In the tradition of the movie Super Size Me, Fast Food Nation describes the inner workings of the convenience food industry. He begins with a few chapters about the founders of some of the major chains, individualists who thought outside the box and worked to revolutionize how people thought about food.<br /><br />Then, the book takes a dark turn, examining what the fast food industry has turned into. Some of the details of the book, such as the chapters on the meatpacking industry, expose some really disgusting and unhealthy industry practices that every consumer should know about. (Upton Sinclair has nothing on Schlosser.) Schlosser also studies the fast food industry from the perspective of its employees, and it is not a pretty picture.<br /><br />Honestly, after reading this book, I will think seriously about eating fast food in the future. After learning about some of the industry's practices, both in relation to the health and quality of the food they serve as well as their policies on labor's role, it is doubtful that I can support such an institution with my hard-earned money. A definite eye-opener.	2004-11-05

This novel didn't stack up very well to some of the other books I've read by Irving. Although I loved Owen Meany, I am less than thrilled with A Widow for One Year.<br /><br />For me, the first part of the book was more interesting than the second half. The story of Ted, Marion, and Eddie was touching, and I felt empathy for the characters at that point in the story. The idea that Marion would have photos of the boys throughout the house rang true to me, as did the concept that Ruth would be carefully schooled about each image and when it was taken. I was enthralled by the wife who couldn't get past the deaths of her sons and her philandering husband, how their grief about the tragedy they'd faced had impacted their marriage. I also felt for the gangly teen-aged Eddie, who had unknowingly walked into the situation.<br /><br />Once the novel moved further along in the characters' lives, though, I just became frustrated with them. Why does Ruth feel the need to maintain a friendship with Hannah, who is a no-show for her readings and has sex with her father? Why does Eddie continue to hold a torch for Marion, who hasn't made contact with him in decades? Why does Ruth pick up a young boy herself on the streets of a foreign city and bring him back to her hotel room? I just didn't feel as though Irving gave his characters enough personality/motivation/whatever to justify these actions. I felt as though I didn't understand the older versions of some of the characters, and I didn't particularly like them, either.	2004-11-04

We used it to tool around the island in a rented car, see the sights in the Waikiki area, and snoop around Chinatown. It gives a good, broad overview to first-time visitors that will help you prioritize what you want to see on the island.<br /><br />A few caveats - driving directions to Lanikai Beach are a bit lacking in this guide; fare for TheBus is now $2 per person, not $1.50; and the Lyon Arboretum was closed uring our visit. Sin of omission - Wo Fat's restaurant in Chinatown is a great dim sum place, but is not included in the guide. As always, call to check on guidebook facts before venturing out. Other than a few discrepancies such as this, we found the book to be fairly accurate and very informative.	2004-11-03

I used it, primarily, to decide which island(s) I wanted to visit. Once I had chosen the island where I would be staying, I bought a guidebook for that island in particular. I didn't consult this book too much after that.<br /><br />A scenario such as this one is the primary one for which I'd reccommend this book. Becuase it covers all of the Hawaiian islands, it is necessarily broad and a little skimpy on detail. Use this guide to choose which islands are right for you, and then buy specific guides for those individual islands. I wouldn't plan an entire Hawaiian vacation based on this guide alone.	2004-11-03

A few of the restaurant recommendations and night life spots were new, but most other things were the same. I ended up using Frommer's Honolulu, Waikiki, and Oahu guide much more than this one.<br /><br />And one has to wonder - with a destination such as Oahu, which is so popular with travelers all over the world; which is the subject of countless tour books, television shows, and other visitor information pieces - how much of the island's treasures can truly remain \\"hidden?\\"	2004-11-03

Lily eventually learns that her mother is inside of her, i.e. she needs to take care of herself, stand up for herself, etc.<br /><br />As a Southern female, I was struck with how the novel resonated with the Mississippian in me. Unlike other reviewers, I thoroughly enjoyed the mystical, fantastical plot elements. A novel doesn't always have to be realistic as long as it is engaging. (I truly loved the idea of the pink house, surrounded by gardens and the melancholy stone wall, with rooms decorated totally in shades of blue and happy bees buzzing in the air. What a wonderful world the author has created!)<br /><br />This is a wonderful, quick read. Although the protagnoist deals with weighty issues, the novel itself is not depressing. Rather, it is uplifting and empowering. A great book!	2004-10-28

Hillenbrand does a wonderful job providing readers with the backstory of all of the characters from this real-life drama. She introduces them to us long before their paths intersect, which helps inform the conclusions we draw about their actions later in the book.<br /><br />Also, one can't help but root for the underdog. Seabiscuit, particularly at the beginning of his racing career, was the ultimate long shot. So was his jockey. It's fun to see the two succeed. (However, the book also traces the eventual failure of Red Pollard, which is a rather depressing tale.)<br /><br />Descriptions of the races can get a bit technical, so readers (particularly those with little knowledge of the sport of horseracing) will have to follow them closely to truly understand the action. For me, the book was a little too long. After learning so much about the Pollard character, it was difficult to read about the final chapters of his life.	2004-10-28

In fact, I was sad to reach the end of it.<br /><br />I Know This Much Is True is a poignant, complicated look at family, mental illness, guilt, love, and the everyday land mines of life. For me, the book had particular meaning, as my mother is a twin who recently lost her sister. I loved the way the book explored the concept of \\"twinness,\\" and how twins both want to differentiate themselves from one another and also feel like the same person.<br /><br />The symbolism - drowning, death, self-reflection - was really interesting to me as a reader. Lamb weaves these elements into the story without hitting you over the head with them.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Lamb's expert use of multiple storylines in the novel. The abundance of plot material (the twins as they grew up, the twins in the present, the story of the twins' grandfather) was one of the things that kept the novel clipping along and kept me, as a reader, wanting more.<br /><br />This is one of the few must-read books I've been lucky enough to stumble across lately. I highly encourage giving it a read.	2004-10-27

I did notice a dip in my mood as I was reading it. However, not all good books are feel-good tomes full of sunshine and rainbows.<br /><br />It is a testament to the skill of Wally Lamb that I cannot forget Delores Price. In many ways, her story is haunting. She deals poorly with immense obstacles throughout most of the book. She often makes the wrong choices. She struggles with food addictions, abuse, abandonment issues, and attachment problems. She is flawed as hell. But, by the end of the novel, her story is oddly redemptive. Although it did dampen my mood for a week or so, I'm glad I read She's Come Undone. I will definitely read more novels by Lamb; he's on to something.	2004-10-27

Pardon my ignorance, but I'm not sure if I understand the storm of praise that has been heaped upon this book. I found some passages funny and some very touching. However, I thought that overall, the book was a bit uneven and disjounted, and I spent the better part of my time reading it wondering why on earth I was forging on.<br /><br />The character of Alex is engaging, as is his quaint mangling of the English language. I also admired the \\"hero\\" of the book for his tenacity in seeking out family history with little more than a stained photograph and a fervent desire. As well, the author does have a unique knack for language. However, I am less sure that these elements alone make for a satisfying novel.	2004-10-27

Vreeland does a wonderful job with this book, which follows the life of a painting, from the present day back to its creation. The style of the story is reminiscent (albeit in reverse chronology) of the movie Tales of Manhattan (Ginger Rogers, Cesar Romero, you remember), which follows a tail coat through its remarkably adventurous life. What makes such a journey insteresting is the way the painting is bound inextricably to the scandals, loves, secrets, and desires of the characters who, at various times, own it. Reading the frankly personal chapters, I almost felt like a private eye, tracing the painting's history and linking the characters together.<br /><br />While Vreeland doesn't claim to be an art expert, she does a wonderful job describing the nuances of the painting, and she clearly has admiration for the craft of the artist. I very much enjoyed this book, and it reads surprisingly quickly. You can easily finish it in one or two sittings. A real gem.	2004-10-27

Diamant does a good job of weaving together accounts in the Bible, history, and her own imiagination to create a story about women and what their lives might have been like during Biblical times. To those reviewers who have complained that The Red Tent does not mirror accounts in the Bible, my answer would be that this novel is a new creation, based loosely on the Bible and what we know of historical fact from this time period.<br /><br />The characters' lives illustrate the challenges women faced, including their positions and duties within the society, the limits that were foisted upon them, and the roles of both faith and special talents/gifts within their stories. Don't read this book expecting rote regurgitation from the Bible. Rather, be prepared for an imaginative, rich, and detailed story set during Biblical times and depicting some Biblical characters. A good read.	2004-08-19

Being a native Mississippian with two sisters myself, I was struck by how true-to-life this play is. The script captures that elusive &quot;sense of place&quot; that all the critics talk about when discussing the South - crazy relatives, old friends with haunted pasts, the importance of food and other types of sustenance. The plot revolves around wacky personalities, old wounds, and unplanned events, and even though the characters frequently despair, the show ends on a hopeful note.<br />As with most plays, it's better to watch Crimes of the Heart than to read it, but I admit that I laughed out loud when I read some of the scenes. Henley won a Pulitzer for her work in Crimes of the Heart, and I think it was well-deserved.	2004-06-04

Themes of civilzation vs. savagery and the untouched beauty of the tropics vs. development are found throughout Green Mansions, but these issues are encased in a love story that holds notes of mystery, fantasy, and romanticism.<br />While the novel provides a good introduction to the naturalist writings of this period (and a much easier read than most of the more scientific prose being written at the time), I thought that the ending was not as developed as the rest of the book, in addition to being highly unsatisfying. The novel does, however, offer wonderful descriptions of the wild forests of the region, and develops fantastical characters, particularly in the case of Rima, the primary female character.	2004-02-25

An early environmentalist, Hudson often laments man's destruction of nature in this volume, presenting wonderful arguments as to the value of convservation. I probably wouldn't recommend this as an easy leisure read, but it is a good example of naturalist writing. Hudson's stories and obvious admiration of nature keep the book from being too dry.	2004-02-25

I actually liked this book a little better than Daughter of Fortune, because I felt there was at least a little more mystery involved. There are many compelling characters in the book, but, unfortunately, I didn't really think that Aurora (the storyteller) was one of them. Her grandmother Paulina was infinitely more interesting. Also, I thought the title was strained. It felt like Allende just tacked a paragraph or two onto the end of the story to justify the title. Although Aurora was a photographer, I didn't feel that the title naturally sprang from the work. Rather, it was foisted upon it.	2004-01-09

What makes the play so powerful is its ability to show us a family with horrible problems and horrible habits, but still make that family likeable. We still hope for them. A heroin-addicted mother torments herself with the past. Her egomaniac husband, a washed-up actor, postures and struts to cover his feelings of responsibility. Their sons battle depression and alcoholism, and neither ever feel good about themselves. A cycle of blame makes its way continually through the house, a run-down affair often shrouded in fog.

The ONLY reason that I haven't rated this book a 5 is that most of the recipes are high in fat. (Gotta watch the old waistline . . . !)	2002-06-05

The information on each destination is wonderfully complete, with maps, phone numbers, and detailed lists of available features and services. This book is a wonderful resource for people interested in exploring the rich flora and fauna of Mississippi.	2002-05-28

Very seldom do I laugh out loud when I read, but Mama and her daughters were portrayed so truthfully that I had to chuckle at the reality of it all. I especially enjoy White's depiction of rural southerners. We seem to get a bad reputation in so many novels and movies that it has become quite refreshing to read about kind, intelligent residents of the South. (They do exist, you know.) &quot;Gardening&quot; and &quot;Non-Representational Art&quot; were both particularly memorable.	2002-05-22

I bought this cookbook just before I got married, and it is a resource that I have reached for again and again. The recipes are quick, delicious, and usually require ingredients that you already have in the kitchen. (No miso paste here.) The main dish entrees focus on lean meats, poultry, and fish with light but flavorful sauces. Almost every recipe I've tried out of the book (and I've tried most of them) has come out a winner, with minimal time and effort on my part. This cookbook is truly one of the trusty standbys of my kitchen.	2002-05-22

I tend to like Irving anyway, but this book is particularly special. I love the story of Owen and his faith. I love the way the story comes together in the end. In fact the only complaint that I have about this book at all is the continual return of the narrator to the present. I didn't want anyone to interrupt the story about Owen. I have passed this book along to my sister, my mom, and other friends, and everyone has loved it. A definite must-read.	2002-01-04

(Think Nicholas Sparks at Christmas.) Descriptive details and the hanky factor are both good, but the characters are never fully developed. Their moments of weakness are too temporary and too understandable. I never felt as if any of the characters were real people.	2002-01-04

True, some of Amy's ideas are a little extreme, but, then again, do we all decorate our cookies with as much precision as Martha Stewart? The point is to go through the book and pick out the ideas that work for you. Using Amy's tips, I have managed to sock away enough money to fund an emergency savings account and pay for a trip to Paris.	2002-01-04

I plan on reading it aloud every year. The story really reminds me of when I was young and everyone piled into my grandmother's house for Christmas. Plus, kids love the Shhhhhh and Whhhh noises!	2002-01-04

It's a great primer, and I still have it on my bookshelf today.<br />The only caution I would give to beginners buying this book is to slow down. Not every institution/business is going to have the budget for some of these ideas. Do what you can with the resources you have, and use the book as a good guide.	2002-01-04

I bought this when I was just starting out in PR, and I can't tell you how many times I have referred to it since then. What I like best about the book is that it doesn't just give you pie-in-the-sky objectives like &quot;develop your brand.&quot; What the book offers is specific actions you can take and ideas you can springboard off of to create publicity for your small business or non-profit. REAL ideas, not just puffery. The authors suggest specific stories for certain times of the year, they outline news cycles, they try to teach folks how to distinguish from real news and self-serving fluff.	2002-01-04

The world quickly recognized how small they were really thinking to have produced such a masterpiece, and the show had a run on the West End and then came to Broadway.<br />This is one of the funniest plays I've seen/read since Noises Off. Although it takes some imagination when reading the text, one can easily see how utterly comic and tragic the production is. I love this play because it allows actors to stretch, because it doesn't rely on big sets and fancy costumes to engage the audience, and because it's funny as hell. A good read, and a definite must-see.	2002-01-04
US	50918449	R2TPR37FLHB5PK	0446608955	721431789	A Walk to Remember	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Sappy  summer read	This is a good book to pick up if you're on your way to a long plane flight, a week of sunning on the beach, or an extended time on the throne. It's a fairly quick read, with no deep concepts to grasp or difficult vocabulary. (Which sometimes, I must admit, is exactly what I need. Kind-of like the book version of the musical CATS.)<br />If you want to ponder something, though, and figure it out, and wonder what the characters might do next, don't pick this book up. I'd say it's strictly lazy summer reading.	2002-01-04

I have also read Fodor's and have done extensive research online, but I like the irreverent book because it's small, informative, and opinionated. I don't need another sixty pages listing the museums in France. What I need is for someone knowledgable to tell me which museums are worth the time and which ones aren't	2002-01-04

It's got dragons, magic, a mean Lord Gurr, and poor Minnie and her nephews. What's not to like? The illustrations are very colorful, too.<br />This Christmas, I found a vintage copy of this book and gave it to my sister as a gift. She read it aloud, and it's as good today as it always was. Morals: don't be greedy; if you help people, you will be rewarded.	2002-01-04
