Some of the contributors were fresh (actually a little jet-lagged) from the Vienna Conference a few days before.<br /><br />Alan Musgrave describes how Popper (might have) solved the problem of induction, though what he actually achieved was not a solution but an explanation that the problem is rather like the problem of building a perpetual motion machine, insoluble and not a barrier to progress.<br /><br />Semiha Akini explained how Popper's conventionalism is different from that of  Duhem and Pioncare because it points to the indispensable role of conventions in the methods of science and it does not underwrite decisions about the content or truth of theories. A reference to Jarvie's latest book on the role of conventions or rules of  the game of science would have supported this case.<br /><br />Phillip Catton undertook some really interesting and fine grained criticism of Popper's \\"conjecture and refutation\\" methodology with reference to Harvey's work on the role of the heart, Wegener on Continental Drift, Newton and the Einstein's early work. The gist of his argument is that these developments were \\"rational in ways that Popper ill equips us to fathom\\". I suspect that this criticism may not be as telling as he believes, for example finding out that Newton was a fallibilist hardly unsettles Popper's theory of conjectural knowledge, though it may correct some ideas that Popper and others had about Newton.<br /><br />Wenceslao J Gonzalez discussed the many faces of Popper's methodological approach to prediction, with some reference to economics. Unfortunately there is no mention of the large body of work in this field by Larry Boland is not mentioned here although he is the outstanding Popperian contributor to the philosophy and methodology of economics.<br /><br />Jeremy Shearmur provided a challenge to the bulk of the philosophical profession to see if  they might have something to learn from Popper, at least from his habit of addressing problems that have both intellectual and practical import, and writing in language that is accessible to interested members of the public. It seems that Popper has practically ceased to register among both Continental and analytical philosophers, on which topic see some evidence presented below by Jeremy Waldron. Peter Munz was also entertaining and especially challenging with his thesis that Popper and Wittgenstein should have gone into partnership to provide elements that are missing from each other's schemes.<br /><br />Alan Ryan is a veteran commentator on these issues and he addressed the relationship between science and politics with three questions in mind. One, is democracy good for science? Two, can or should scientists seek consensus in their own fields in the same way that citizens seek consensus on public policy? Three, is science good for democracy? It seems that democracy is good for science. On the matter of  scientific rationality as a model for rationality in the political domain, the answer is a muted yes, with some help from Dewey and a cryptic reference to Habermas. On the benefits of science for democracy, Ryan is not encouraging, noting the way that Big Science has generated demands for big money and that is the root of a great deal of political evil.<br /><br />Anthony O'Hear contributed an interesting and challenging criticism of the notion of the open society as a utopia.  His main criticism is that social institutions are not just problem-solving instruments that can be designed by social engineers and put in place  on order (football clubs to solve the problem of people who want to play football), they function in many ways that give meaning and purpose to people's lives. This is a fascinating paper although I think if the open society is regarded as an ideal type (in contrast with an equally idealised closed society) rather than a utopian aim, then we can get the benefit of  Popper's ideas without collapsing into that form of  constructivist rationalism that Hayek has identified as the great and destructive superstition of modern times.<br /><br />Jeremy Waldron writes on tribalism and the myth of the framework with special attention to the politics of cultural recognition. This is an intricate defence of the idea of expanding the scope of critical rationalism to address problems of culture clash in  multicultural and multiracial societies. One of his targets, following Popper, is the idea that people need to share a whole framework of beliefs before they can get on together or discuss anything usefully. The example of trade would appear to be a major counter-example, where goods can be traded across all manner of social divisions just provided that both parties want to do business. I think there is a rather significant lesson to be learned there.<br /><br />In a footnote Waldron reported a quick assessment of the amount of attention being paid to \\"The Open Society\\" in modern political philosophy. He used a data base on the most prominent journals for essays in political theory or political philosophy (\\"Ethics\\", \\"Philosophy and Public Affairs\\" and \\"Political Theory\\"), searching for 'Popper' within ten words of 'Open' in the full text of articles published in these journals between 1960 and 1999. Over the four decades OSE was cited in just 23 articles, mostly in a perfunctory way: either as a source for a particular phrase (like 'radical social engineering') or to mention, without elaboration, the attacks on Plato, Hegel and Marx. Six of them devote a sentence or two to his views on topics like utopianism, psychologism, the fact/value gap and negative utilitarianism.

Over the last couple of decades it has become increasingly difficult to write history outside of a particular left/progressive mould without attracting abuse. This has produced a reaction from some challengers, such as Keith Windschuttle and others, who have called the progressives for serious bias or even outright falsification in their  historical accounts.<br />Stuart Macintyre is an outstandingly progressive  historian who joined the Communist Party in the 1960s. He is also one of the most senior and influential academic historians in Australia so his example, for better or worse, is likely to exert a profound influence in the profession.<br />In the first part of this book he explains that history is a discipline, a branch of knowledge that is governed by rules of evidence, so that historians create history but  they are not free to invent or falsify it. Honesty and professional standards matter. He wrote that adherence to such standards is one of the issues at stake in the History Wars. (p 29-30)<br />This position on professionalism and the importance of respect for the truth is apparently spelled out to rebuke the conservative and revisionist History Warriors.<br />They obey only Rafferty's rules. They caricature their opponents and impugn their motives. They appeal to loyalty, hope, fear and prejudice.  In their intimidation of the history profession, they act as bullies. In submitting history to the loyalty test, they debase it. Australians deserve more from their history than the History Wars.(p 222)<br />After the introductory chapters on the evolution of the profession in Australia and the craft of the trade there are some case histories of the &quot;wars&quot;,some episodes when leading historians were under fire for outspoken public statements,  the battle for control of the agenda for the Bicentenary celebrations, disputes over the extent of violence on the frontier during settlement of the continent, allegations of  bias in the National Museum, and a chapter on the response by Prime Minister Howard and his colleagues to the historians who adopt an apologetic attitude to our history. Here Macintyre joins the contest in opposition to the so-called History Warriors and it is apparent that his partisan stance has damaged his respect for the facts.  For example, Pauline Hanson, a populist politician who enjoyed a short season of success,  did not condemn assistance to Aboriginals as claimed in this book (p 139), in fact she echoed the call from Martin Luther King for rewards or welfare  on the basis of merit or need, not skin colour.<br />People who are closer to the action may know whether Stuart Macintyre, in his effort to depict himself as a fair dealing elder statesman,  has failed in a genuine effort to transcend his own history, or  whether he has adopted a pose. Presumable time will tell.  In the meantime we can hope that his colleagues will follow his precepts rather than his practice. He has demanded  high standards of  honesty, civility and professionalism, so it will be an interesting exercise to judge his performance, and that of his progressive colleagues, by his own standards.continent, allegations of  bias in the National Museum, and a chapter on the response by Prime Minister Howard and his colleagues to the historians who adopt an apologetic attitude to our history.

In the 1950s the Congress spread throughout the world, successfully creating magazines, organizing protests, establishing a network of affiliated national committees and fostering international contacts. The Congress continued into the 1960s, broadening its focus to lay the basis of an international community of liberal and democratic intellectuals. It was America's principal attempt to win over the world's intellectuals to the liberal democratic cause.?h<br />The Great War of 1914-18 was a great evil but it spawned another that turned out to be far worse.  This was the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Red takeover in the aftermath of the revolution.  For the remainder of the century the Soviet empire spread devastation across the globe, not only in it's own domain but in every other country where its agents and its ideology polluted both politics and the world of ideas.<br />Peter Coleman has provided an invaluable account of the counter-attack by liberal intellectuals in the battle of ideas with communism.  At the time that this story begins, Arthur Koestler was convinced that the future of civilisation would be decided by the outcome of the battle between communists and ex-communists like himself.  He believed that others could not comprehend the true nature of  their adversary, with its capacity to recruit both the best of people and the worst of people.  He was mistaken. The thin anti-red line was held by a mix of ex-communists and others who had not drunk from that poisoned cup.<br />The Liberal Conspiracy is the story of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, the loose-knit world-wide confederation of groups and people who attempted to match the influence of the communists and their fellow travellers in the cultural and educational arenas. It is a proud and heroic tale, although it was mostly just slogging, old-fashioned hard work. Few of the protagonists would claim the mantle of heroism but they deserve high praise for their courage and their fortitude.<br />&quot;Then, in an era of the Vietnam War, a New Left, a new Conservatism and an emerging detente, the Congress  began to falter in its purpose. It was finally dissolved in 1967 amidst disclosures of its funding by the CIA&quot;.<br />The opponents of the Congress, the ?guseful idiots?h in the west who helped to prop up the Soviet empire, attempted to claim a moral victory when it transpired that the CIA was contributing funds to the movement. This scandalous story has not yet run its full course, however the information emerging from the Eastern European archives should ensure that eventually the full story of the treason of the communist fellow travellers will be told.

Poppers Und Des Kritischen Rationalismus)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	The rules of the game of science	This book should put an end to the view that Popper's philosophy of science can usefully be summed up by the label &quot;falsificationism&quot;, a view that has been perpetuated even by commentators as well informed and sympathetic as Alan Chalmers in What is this thing called Science? Popper expounded a critical method, with five forms of criticism.<br />1. The check on the problem. Does the theory solve the problem?<br />2. The check of logic. Is the theory internally consistent?<br />3. The check of consistency with other well-tested theories.<br />4. The check of evidence, falsifiability (if this is appropriate).<br />5. The check on the metaphysics.<br />The focus in this book by Jarvie is check 4, the use of evidence, although this is just the point of departure and the destination is much more interesting.<br />Jarvie argues strenuously that Popper's first major work in early 1930s can be interpreted to anticipate the social turn in the philosophy of science. This may be called the strong version of his thesis, by analogy with the strong program in the sociology of science. A weaker version of Jarvie?fs thesis, which is equally fruitful but possibly less controversial, is that Popper should be regarded as a conventionalist in scientific methodology (not to be confused with conventionalism as a theory of truth). Jarvie has argued convincingly that the decisive achievement of Logik der Forschung was to show the indispensable function of methodological conventions as rules of the game in science. This mirrors Popper?fs approach to political philosophy; as the function of the philosophy of science is to formulate and criticize the rules of the game of science, so the function of moral and political philosophy is to do the same for the rules of the game of social and political life. These rules may be unwritten conventions, mores and folkways, traditions, laws of the land and institutions of all kinds.<br />The Introduction to the book, Science as an Institution, sets out the major issues in the complex relationship between science and society that Jarvie hopes to illuminate. The word science of course has many different uses and discussion can easily be confused by conflating two or more of the meanings. Science may refer to a body of public knowledge; a set of beliefs about the world; the whole range of activities performed by scientists; some subset of those activities that are supposed to be special to science; the social and political institutions that influence the activities of scientists. Jacques Barzun wrote a particularly valuable book with the title Science: The Glorious Entertainment. Jarvie is clearly aware of the nuances of the topic and he surveys various approaches to it, including the positivist and falsificationist demarcation principles and Merton's sociological account of the distinguishing features of scientific knowledge.<br />Chapter 1 unpacks the hidden elements of the social turn in Popper's early philosophy of science. The key concept here is the need for rules of the game in science and these constitute what Jarvie calls the proto-constitution of science. This is the foundation of his project and he spells out this constitution in some detail, drawing from The Logic of Scientific Discovery (originally Logik der Forschung, 1935). In the following chapters he works through the evolution of Popper's thoughts over the decade from 1935 to 1945 to show how his views on science and society developed to the point they reached in The Poverty of Historicism and The Open Society and its Enemies.<br />The second chapter of Jarvie's book is called Popper's 1935 Proto-Constitution for the Republic of Science. This contains a list with Popper's supreme or meta-rule (SR) and 14 subsidiary rules (R1 to R14), which constitute the rudimentary scaffolding for Popper's republic of science.<br />SR: The other rules of scientific procedure must be designed in such a way that they do not protect any statement in science against falsification.<br />R1: The game of science is, in principle, without end. He who decides one day that scientific statements do not call for any further test, and that they can be regarded as finally verified, retires from the game.<br />R2: Once a hypothesis has been proposed and tested, and has proved its mettle, it may not be allowed to drop out without 'good reason'.<br />The &quot;supreme rule&quot; and the first two subsidiary rules were proposed by Popper, then Jarvie has identified additional rules that can be found scattered in the text of Popper's book.<br />R3: We are not to abandon the search for universal laws and for a coherent theoretical system, nor ever give up our attempts to explain causally any kind of event we can describe.<br />R5: Only those auxiliary hypotheses are acceptable whose introduction does not diminish the degree of falsifiability or testability of the system in question but, on the contrary, increases it.<br />R9: After having produced some criticism of a rival theory, we should always make a serious attempt to apply this criticism to our own theory.<br />And so on.<br />Jarvie's commentary on the constitution begins with the reminder that it is very incomplete. He notes also that it is very abstract, as thought the whole of science is a kind of debating society, leaving out of account a great deal of gritty reality, such as the question of leadership in the decision-making that is inevitably required, including decisions about adding to the constitution or revising it.<br />One of the implications of the social turn described by Jarvie is that the nature of objectivity is radically shifted. It ceases to be a problem for individual scientists, requiring that they be unbiased, rational and free from preconceptions. It becomes a situational or institutional problem, calling for such things as theoretical pluralism, clear formulation of the problems that the theories are supposed to solve, the design of critical experiments, the existence of journals, seminars and conferences to facilitate critical discussion. Some of these requirements need to be provided by individual scientists, especially new ideas and imaginative criticism; others call for institutions, including political institutions, to protect the autonomy of the journals and the research institutes.falsification.<br />R1: The game of science is, in principle, without end.

These are:<br /><br />1. The denial of truth in reference.<br />2. The repudiation of the individual subject.<br />3. The dissolution of substantive moral and aesthetic evaluation.<br /><br />It needs to be understood that civilised life would be impossible on the planet if these ideas become as common in the general community as they are among avant garde students of literature, assuming that they are sincere and are not just promulgating outlandish ideas for kicks or for professional advancement.<br /><br />The new theory sets itself against the old 'humanism' which is said to lack rigor, self-awareness and methodological sophistication. Further, for reasons that are never explained, humanists are supposed to be committed to a conception of the self as atomistic and unconditioned, and to a conservative ideology that props up the status quo (capitalism).<br /><br />It is clear that the authors have impeccably progressive tendencies and their objections to constructivist anti-humanism are entirely conscientious and are not a concession to the forces of  repression and reaction.<br /><br />The claims of the new theorists survive for the most part unchallenged in their own domain because it seems that students of literature and cognate cultural studies no longer read traditional literary texts or literary criticism to learn anything from them, but rather to subject them to dissection along the lines of the new theories. Perhaps literary scholars are intimidated by the mixture of literature and philosophy provided by the new theorists and so they give them the benefit of the doubt without actually understanding them, while they<br />think that the theory of literature has reached unprecedented heights of sophistication.<br /><br />Not enough people are at home in both disciplines and this book is the happy result of collaboration between authors located respectively in English and Philosophy. Freadman and Miller work their way through the major bodies of new theory;  Althusserian Marxism; Derridean poststructuralism; Foucauldian Discourse Power<br />Theory, using a nice combination of  textual analysis and philosophicalacumen. The result is devastating for the new theorists, although the authors explain that they are not opposed to theory, just theories that do not stand up to criticism.<br /><br />They conclude the book with an exposition and a defence of  theory and criticism along lines that are at once humanistic, illuminating and rigorous. It includes  a number of commitments that run counter to the 'theory' paradigm: \\"One, that theory properly understood is not particular to constructivist anti-humanist thought; two, that substantive conceptions of the individual subject are indispensable, both in respect of<br />literature and of politics; three, that language both literary and other, can give us access to significant features of a reality that is not itself a linguistic construct; four, that discourses of value, both aesthetic and moral, are indispensable; and, five, that the category 'literature' remains solid and valuable\\".<br /><br />Put this book on your shelf alongside Rene Wellek and Austin Warren's \\"Theory of Literature\\".the doubt without actually understanding them, while they  think that the theory of literature has reached unprecedented heights of sophistication.

I am not aware of any reasonable person in recent decades who has gone on record to espouse that  faith and Gray does not actually quote anyone who does. That alone makes the book a sustained non sequitor, an attack on straw dummies.<br /><br />Perhaps the naive belief that things can only ever get better is worthy of five minutes demolition work. However to target science, reason, technology and morality as unmitigated agents of destruction is altogether over the top, apart from being rather old hat. It is entirely appropriate to be skeptical about the human institutions of science and technology, they are of course human and fallible, as indeed we all are.<br />Similarly beware of moralists. But beware of people who criticise science and technology with nothing better to offer than the Gaia principle and eastern mysticism.  And beware of people who suggests that morality does not matter.<br />To be fair to Gray, there are nuggets of sense on the book. &quot;Today the good life means making use of science and technology - without succumbing to the illusion that they can make us free, reasonable or even sane. It means seeking peace - without hoping for a world without war. It means cherishing freedom - in the knowledge that it is an interval between anarchy and tyranny.&quot;<br /><br />This is an echo of Bertrand Russell &quot;In praise of idleness&quot; where he wrote about the importance of knowledge that consists not only in its direct practical utility but also in the fact that it promotes a widely contemplative habit of mind. &quot;On this ground, utility is to be found in much of the knowledge that is nowadays labelled useless.&quot;<br /><br />The problem in Gray's book is to sift the nuggets of sense from the mysticism and anti-rationalism that constitute most of the contents. In some ways it reads like a personal retraction of a faith that he once held, as he grapples with the realisation of his own mortality, like an ageing hippie, or a somewhat chastened relict of the madness of the 1960s.<br /><br />Gray has over a dozen books under his belt, some of them very good ones, from the days when he used to take Popper and Hayek seriously and  appeared to understand what they were talking about. Now he has lapsed into errors that would fail him in Philosophy I.<br /><br />&quot;According to the most influential twentieth-century philosopher of science, Karl Popper, a theory...should be given up as soon as it has been falsified&quot;.<br />Well, actually, no. For Popper a theory that appears to be falsified is rendered problematic, there is no reason to 'give it up' because it may still be the best one we have.<br /><br />&quot;Philosophers have always tried to show that we are not like other animals, sniffing  their way uncertainly through the world. Yet after all the work of  Plato and Spinoza, Descartes and Bertrand Russell we have no more reason than other animals do for believing that the sun will rise tomorrow&quot;.<br />Well what about the work by Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and  Newton...?<br /><br />What are the positives in this collage of half-baked anthropology, animal studies, mysticicism, plus philosophical and sociological babble? The Gaia principle? The supposedly profound bottom line is to give up on thinking and purposeful activity. &quot;Other animals do not need a purpose in life. A contradiction to itself, the human animal cannot do without one. Can we not think of the aim of life as being simply to see?&quot;<br /><br />On behalf of the much maligned liberal humanists I would like to suggest that we can generate any number of useful aims in life beyond merely &quot;seeing&quot;, whatever that means. We can adopt the reasonable and non-utopian aim of making the world a little better every day, starting with our own relations with our immediateassociates. We can support learning and scholarship, and engage in the exchange of  helpful commentary and criticism of ideas that we believe to be defective. We can promote critical rationalism, free trade, free speech, tolerance and political reforms, especially in the direction of the minimum state, to protect freedoms and promote peace and prosperity.support learning and scholarship, and engage in the exchange of  helpful commentary and criticism of ideas that we believe to be defective.

Second, the era from the French Revolution which he labels the Romantic Period from 1789 to 1840. And finally the more recent turn of modernism in ideas, art and manners that he places at the turn of the century from 1890 to 1914.<br />In the first lecture Barzun examined the complex of institutions and vested interests called Art to consider the contribution that they made to individual people and to society in the large. He justified this examination for two reasons: first, the power and influence that Art can exert as a vehicle of communication and second, the amazingly perverse messages that are being conveyed by Art at the present time \\"in opposition to every traditional idea, feeling and activity, including art itself\\" (24).<br />In the second lecture he examined the rise of art as a substitute for religion in the nineteenth century. Art simultaneously became the \\"ultimate critic of life and the moral censor of society\\".  The next phase in that development is the topic of the third lecture on Art the Destroyer, treating Estheticism and Abolitionism during the period 1890 to 1914.<br />He made a rash claim that the world since 1920 \\"has merely amplified and multiplied what the nineties and early 1920s first achieved...a long list of inventions and activities, from flying machines and motion pictures to skyscrapers, psychoanalysis, and organ transplants, and from the concentration camp to the strip-tease, date not from now but from then. I shall suggest later on why western civilization has not had a new idea in fifty years\\".<br />Atomic power and the rise of the computer would appear to test that proposition! But still, getting back to Art, he sketched its destructive function over the last 150 years (now 180). \\"By the tradition of the New, art unremittingly destroys past art, though by the cognate tradition of historical sympathy we deny ourselves the unity of a contemporary style. By making extreme moral and esthetic demands in the harsh way of shock and insult, art unsettles the self and destroys confidence and spontaneity in individual conduct.\\"<br />Art in this function has helped to undermine the assumptions that the state and civilized society are valuable or admirable, thus impairing the effectiveness of political and social institutions and proving the destroyers' own case. By linking the growing interest and respect for art in modern times with the \\"dominance of bourgeoise values\\"  Art has effectively turned on art itself by becoming a vehicle for every kind of assault on traditional standards of beauty, craft, morality and commonsense.  This was written thirty years ago and all that has changed is the increased number of students who are exposed to more advanced \\"theory\\" to justify the assault of Art on our senses and sensibilities.<br />In the fourth lecture he moved on to another piece in the crazy pavement of modern art, the function of art as redeemer, linked with the previously noted concept of art as a substitute for religion. Barzun accepted the common ground, that the power exerted by great art on receptive persons is a religious power, and he pursued the defects that follow when that insight is not checked by critical thinking. He discussed the individual and collective forms of salvation through Art that have been promulgated for 200 years. By the term collective salvation he means the appeal of revolutionary art which offers the artist a special role, first as evangelist and later as beneficiary, in the utopian society brought about by the revolution.<br />In the next lecture he turned his attention to the troubled relationship between  Science and Art, describing how artists have entered into competition with scientists to claim some of the respect (and the material benefits) that have been generally granted to modern Science.  One of the fruits of this endeavour has been the proliferation of \\"art bollocks\\" that is , the use of pretentious jargon to emulate the (supposed) precision and profundity of scientific discourse.<br />The following passage is an early example of the genre, with a translation provided by a cynical commentator.<br />For Rousseau a painting was a primary surface on which he relied physically as a means for the projection of his thought [Translation: Rousseau wanted to paint on canvas]. But his thought consisted exclusively of plastic elements. While structure and composition constituted the base, the pictorial substance was distributed gradually as execution progressed. [He painted while painting, since one cannot cover the whole canvas at one stroke]. In his work, what simplicity! Nothing descriptive - only surface relations on the given primary surface. These relations are infinitely varied and, without losing their inherent reality, they can also compete with nature within the limits of the painting. [He drew natural objects in two dimensions, or, to avoid tautology, he drew objects]. Rousseau does not copy the exterior aspect of a tree: he creates an internal rhythmic whole conveying the true, grave expressionism of the essentials of a tree and its leaves in relation to a forest...But his style was established neither derivatively nor in obedience to fashion.  It stemmed from the determination of his whole mind as it incarnated his artistic ambitions.

US	49163407	RY57W0ULK5EDJ	1893554120	824181499	The Killing of History: How Literary Critics and Social Theorists Are Murdering Our Past	Books	4	15	18	N	N	Icebergs in the sealanes	Keith Windschuttle was a young radical who grew up to become a scourge of the progressive intelligentsia and intellectual fraud. He is a courageous advocate for his causes and he is prepared to venture into the \\"lions dens\\" of his opponents to engage them in face to face debate, most recently in connection with his book \\"The Fabrication of Aboriginal History\\".<br />This earlier work is a critique of some modern theorists and theories which threaten to turn history and the humanities at large into an intellectual wasteland. It  should be placed on the shelf alongside Sokal and Bricmont's book on intellectual impostures, though unfortunately the downside of both books is that the authors have misread the philosophy of Karl Popper and so depict him as a part of the problem and not as an ally.<br />The first chapter \\"Paris labels and designed concepts: The assension of cultural studies and the deluge of social theory\\" provides a valuable overview of the various intellectual icebergs that are floating loose in the sealanes of discourse. Many of the key players hail from France, though the German Heidegger was a major influence in paving the way for younger generations. Marxism and socialism in various forms provide a subtext for the movement, even while Marxism in its more rigorous traditional forms has become unfashionable. Cultural studies has become the major growth area on campus, catering for the perceived grievances of various groups and political movements.<br />The deluge of cultural theory incudes structuralism and semiotics, poststructuralism, and various kinds of postmodernism. The latter are classified as: the Neitzsche and Heidegger version; The Paris 1980s version (Lyotard and Baudrillard); the art and architecture version; the literary version; and the popular culture version. Marxism and critical theory still eke out an existence, mostly associated with the Frankfurt School, with Jurgen Habermas as the leader. Respect for reason survives in this group, unlike most of the others, and it will be interesting to see how long its economic illiteracy can survive in the face of the growing profile of the Austrian (Menger/Hayek) school. Another major grouping is concerned with postcolonialism and heterology. Here Franz Fanon was the pioneer and Edward Said is the leading contemporary exponent.<br /><br />One of the benefits of this book is that it is not all theory and readers will learn some history from the examples that the author has chosen for analysis. One of these is the Spanish conquest of South America. Some historians have depicted this as western serpents corrupting a peaceful and harmonious garden of  Eden, neglecting to mention the ferocious and bloodthirsty tyranny of the major empires. In a chapter on Captain Bligh of the Bounty and Captain Cook in Tahiti, Windschuttle shows how a theorist with preconceived ideas was refuted in the one case by his own data and in the other by a more careful study by another researcher.  In a long chapter on Paul Carter's account of the first settlers in Australia, Windschuttle explains how a work which appears to be intellectually formidable turns out to be replete with so many self-contradictions, factual inaccuracies and trite interpretations, and is so continuously and odiously pretentious, that it is hard to take seriously. However it displays all the characteristics of the  methodological approaches that have now surged to the front in history.<br />In a chapter on History as a Social Science the author examines some modern developments in the philosophy of science that are attributed to the influence of Popper and Kuhn. Undoubtedly Kuhn and his followers have been a major source of obscurantism and relativism, however in the case of Popper the author does not refer to Popper's views on historical explanation by way of situational analysis and thematic narratives. These were spelled out in chapter 25 of \\"The Open Society and its Enemies\\", a book which might have accelerated Windschuttle's emancipation from the left. Instead of addressing Popper's fully-developed account of historical explanation, KW takes issue with Popper's critique of  the strong form of empiricism or positivism which demands that all claims to knowledge must be sourced to an observer. Popper demonstrated that this demand cannot be met due to the problem of infinite regress. This problem applies in  science and in historical studies, though in Popper's view it does not destroy either enterprise (it just destroys the credibility of strong forms of positivism and empiricism). Unfortunately KW misread this critique as an attack on the possibility of  historical knowledge where we do not have access to any living observers. In fact Popper has no argument with the standard historical methods, drawing on a wide range of sources, though none can be accepted uncritically. This misreading of Popper can probably be attributed to the unfortunate influence of David Stove. For more on this search on \\"Stove+Rathouse\\". In any case it is a most unfortunate blemish in a valuable book.ted Windschuttle's emancipation from the left.

In the introduction to this book the authors carefully defuse many of these criticisms. They explain that their criticisms of the social sciences and social scientists are confined to carefully designated examples (Kristeva, Lacan and others), with lengthy quotes from primary sources. Derrida, for example, is not in the dock because he has not indulged in the abuse of scientific theories and terminology which is their prime target.  Against the charge of rightwing political bias, Sokal has a strong track record as a Marxist, hardly a recommendation in my view but a handy rejoinder to leftwing critics.<br />Given their carefully limited aim, their critiques are devastating and their book deserves to be read with close and critical attention by all students who are concerned about the standards of scholarship in the humanities and the social sciences.  In general they do not stray into the philosophy of postmodernism, that is not an area where they have the qualifications or the motivation, to engage with the likes of Derrida.<br />The area of philosophy where they do chance their arm is the philosophy of science and, ironically, this is the Achilles heel of the book, though it is not likely to be targeted by their major critics.  They wrote:<br />\\"At a time when superstitions, obscurantism, and nationalist and religious fanaticism are spreading in many parts of the world--including the 'developed' West--it is irresponsible, to say the least, to treat with such casualness what has historically been the principal defense against these follies, namely a rational vision of the world. It is doubtless not the intention of postmodern authors to favor obscurantism, but it is an inevitable consequence of their approach.\\" (p.208)<br />The rational view of the world that they favour is of course the worldview of  modern science. This is supposed to derive its authority from the so-called inductive methods championed by the logical positivists and logical empiricists. They consider that the rationality of science is not only under attack from the postmodernists (the barbarians at the gate) but from other misguide folk, especially T S Kuhn and Karl Popper, who have subverted the rationality of science from the inside.<br />That may be the case with Kuhn but it is not a valid criticism of  Popper. His theory of conjectural objective knowledge provides a defensible rejoinder to relativism and nihilism in a way that the logical empiricists and other forms of positivism do not. The stakes are high in this contest and the authors are well aware of this. For more, do a google search on Rathouse+Popper. It is a cultural disaster of the first magnitude that Popper's ideas have been so thoroughly angled,misunderstood and generally sidelined in the mainstream of philosophy, the social sciences and the humanities.e rational view of the world that they favour is of course the worldview of  modern science.

The authors sought to unite poetics (literary theory) with criticism (evaluation of literature) with scholarship (research) and literary history (the dynamics of literature in contrast with the statics of theory and criticism). This had to be done in a book of reasonable size, without being eclectic or doctrinaire.<br />The authors succeeded in their aim and the book achieved a vast and somewhat unexpected popularity, especially as a grad student text. It has been in print forever and has been translated into many languages.<br />Much of the burden of writing fell on Rene Wellek because Austin Warren (not to be confused with another friend of Wellek, the poet and novelist Robert Penn Warren) was seriously distracted during the project by the protracted illness and death of his wife. Fortunately the job was in good hands because there is not much doubt that Wellek is the premier scholar of literature in modern times. He combined all-round mastery of many of the specialisms that constitute modern literary studies, encyclopaedic reading in several languages, a humane vision and commitment to reason.<br />The book has four parts, first Definitions and Distinctions; with five chapters including 'The Nature of Literature' and 'Literary Theory, Criticism and History'. The second part, Preliminary Operations has a chapter on the ordering and establishment of evidence. Part three The Extrinsic Approach to the Study of Literature, has five chapters including 'Literature and Biography', 'Literature and Psychology' and 'Literature and Society'. Part four, The Intrinsic Study of Literature, contains<br />eight chapters including 'Style and Stylistics', 'Literary Genres', 'Evaluation' and 'Literary History'.<br />The chapter titled \\"The Mode of Existence of a Literary Work of Art\\" is especially interesting because it gives the lie to the claim that modern literary theory and criticism (exemplified by the deconstructionists) have achieved an unprecedented level of philosophical sophistication. They worked through five possibilities, referring to \\"the poem\\" as shorthand for any sort of literature, or perhaps any cultural artefact.<br />1. The poem is a physical artefact consisting of marks on paper, or the grooves on a Babylonian tablet.<br />2. The poem is the sequence of sounds uttered by a speaker, reading aloud.<br />3. The poem is the experience of the reader.<br />4. The poem is an expression of the experience of the author.<br />5. The poem is a stratified complex of values, which cannot be reduced to any of the previous four theories.<br />They rejected (1) because a poem can be preserved in a purely oral tradition. Also the precise physical form of the work is not crucial. Hamlet is the same regardless of the size of the pages or the typeface or errors in typesetting or translation of particular editions.<br />They dismissed (2) because we do not read for the sounds alone, we read for plot and character and much more besides. As for (3) they argued that readers are influenced by all manner of personal circumstances ranging from their own theories of poetry and value to momentary conditions such as fatigue, worry or distraction.<br />The fourth type of theory takes two broad forms; in one the poem represents the intentions of the writer, in the other it reflects in some sense the totality of experience of the author, conscious and unconscious. The first of these views has little credibility because the so-called Intentional Fallacy has taken a severe beating in modern times. The second splits in half again, yielding deep psychological accounts of the work on one hand, and on the other, theories that account for the work as the outcome of large-scale historical and social influences bearing on the writer.<br />Wellek and Warren reject all the foregoing (while allowing some scope for investigations along those lines). They favour (5), a combination of phenomenology and modern linguistics.<br />\\"The workof art, then, appears as an object of knowledge sui generis which has a special ontological status. It is neither real (like a statue) nor mental (like the experience of light or pain) nor ideal (like a triangle). It is a system of norms of ideal concepts, which are intersubjective. They must be assumed to exist in collective ideology, changing with it, accessible only through individual mental experiences based on the sound-structure of its sentences.\\"<br />This perspective clearly has many points of contact with Popper's three world theory of material bodies, subjective minds and objective ideas. The poem is more than a physical (world 1) object because is partly a subjective (world 2) event, and there is even more than that because it has some form of intersubjective existence. Wellek and Warren address this aspect in terms of collective ideology, while Popper speaks of the partial autonomy of the contents. Each formulation calls for a theory about emergent possibilities, sui generis qualities that cannot be reduced, without loss, to the more basic physical and subjective aspects of the poem, in the same way that the higher functions of language cannot be fully reduced to the lower functions.then, appears as an object of knowledge sui generis which has a special ontological status.

It was a book that he discovered, trying to get out, as he completed his second book \\"Frames of Mind\\" after a decade or more of research. He painted a disturbing picture of the way that \\"railway lines\\" of thought were inculcated in students, along with a perverse ranking in the psychology profession whereby people with an interest in humans were at the bottom, and those at the top devoted themselves to obscure issues in experimental methodology.<br />His case is illustrated with remarkable, one might say eccentric, examples such as the mythological beast, the unicorn.<br />They lead forth a young virgin pure and chaste, to whom, when the animal sees her, he approaches, throwing himself upon her. . - Then the girl reaches forth her hand and grasps the horn on the animal's brow and at this point the huntsmen come up and take the beast.<br />The unicorn is introduced as an example of something which is not a hard fact of the physical world but can have symbolic significance as a vehicle of erotic or religious meaning. Hudson wants to establish that a science of human behaviour which ignores the significance of myths is no science at all; consequently much \\"hard\\" experimental psychology is a pious deception. He develops this theme by drawing on this own experience as he worked his way out of the experimental mould towards an appreciation of expectations, meanings and self-image in human experience and motivation.<br />His account of Oxford philosophy and Cambridge of the 1950s is  a wonderful picture of that period when linguistic philosophy wasted the energies of several generations of students. Similarly his account of experimental psychology at both Oxford and Cambridge is an important contribution to the history of ideas and the anthropology of science.<br />Unfortunately this book is out of print but some chapters can be found on line in Rafe's Rathouse.

This is not because he devalues science, art and philanthropy in their proper place and perspective, but because false conceptions of their place and their function has created major problems for university administrators and students.<br />This book traces out some of the problems with Science (with a capital S) that he only had space to hint at in the previous book. At the beginning he surveys the array of contradictory cliches that circulate freely about the nature of science - science will generage a cornucopia versus science will kill us all; science is the greatest achievement of the human mind versus science is killing the soul and spirit of man.<br />And that is just the beginning. In chapter after chapter he lays bare muddled thinking, half truths, misplaced faith in the misunderstood methods of science - in our attitudes towards machinery, towards education in science, towards scientific research.

It contains the heavily edited transcripts from a  series of interviews conducted by Lewis Wolpert on BBC Radio 3 and it maintains the high standard set by Bryan Magee who pioneered the art of extended interviews with men of ideas on the BBC. The result is a treasure-trove of insights into the world of science at the highest level. The book itself is beautifully designed and printed.<br />The thirteen interviews are grouped in five sections. 'First and Last Things' introduces the theoretical physicists Abdus Salam and Michael Berry, the cosmologist Martin Rees and the mathematician Christopher Zeeman. 'Molecules of Life' offers the chemist Dorothy Hodgkin and three molecular biologists - Francis Crick, Sydney Brenner and Gunther Stent. 'Evolving Ideas' presents John Maynard Smith and Stephen Jay Gould, evolutionary biologists. 'The Search' contains Anthony Epstein, a virologist, and the geneticist Walter Bodmer. Richard Gregory the neuropsychologist has a section to himself titled 'Cunning Mechanisms'.<br />The challenge for a book like this is to find people who can talk about their field in simple terms. They also need to convey some insights into the activities that are involved in their work, and the \\"feel\\" of it all. This book suceeds handsomely because all the subjects are interesting and coherent, at least in the edited form provided to us.<br />Deep philosophical thoughts do not feature in the dialogues apart from Wolpert's occasional recourse to Kuhn's language of paradigm shifts. Despite this, useful insights abound. Martin Rees draws a contrast between his own pluralistic approach to rival theories - \\"running the horses against each other\\" to see if any fall by the wayside, and the  more dogmatic approach of  the \\"advocates\\" who feel obliged to defend their pet ideas against all criticisms. Richard Gregory points out that the academic battles between rival dogmatists are \\"very much fought by forgetting half of the counter-evidence\\". He prefers to maintain friendly relations with opponents, \\"not working in cupboards and getting amazingly aggressive about other people who think a bit differently\\" (page 197).<br />Francis Crick, as one would expect from reading The Double Helix, displays a thoroughly  \\"Popperian\\" perspective - 'It's getting rid of false ideas which is the most important thing in developing the good ones...You should not get bogged down with experimental details. You should make some sort of bold assumptions, and try them out' (pp 94-5). This contrasts with the compulsive experimentalist Anthony  Epstein who states 'I don't understand any of that [talk of theory]. I think just sort of messing about is the answer. You've just go to keep messing about at the bench...You make a little bit of apparatus...You see how to change this just a little bit...and you want to tinker with something'(p 165).<br />Only one of these scientists (Gunther Stent) has been touched by the current vogue for the \\"social construction of science\\". The others tend to think that the world is there, in all its complexity and glory, and we do the best we can to improve our understanding of it. In the words of Michael Berry 'It's very important to always realize that there are phenomena, that there is a world outside our heads that we're trying to explain. Otherwise it's a curious game, a form of self indulgence which I think is intellectually not very worthwhile' (47).<br />These scientists display few characteristics in common apart from a burning interest in their vocation and a certain amount of entrepreneurial flair in making the most of opportunities. Many of these arose from the disruption of career paths by the war. For example a bomb destroyed the laboratory where Francis Crick had been painfully making his way as an experimental physicist. Fortunately he was elsewhere doing war work on mines at the time and, after the war, he tossed up between brain research and molecular biology for a change of direction. The impact of hostilities on Abdus Salam was less spectacular but equally decisive. Born in a peasant community in Pakistan he regarded the Civil Service as the peak of achievement but the war stopped the entrance exams and he did an MA in mathematics instead. This earned him a scholarship to Cambridge which led, in turn, to the Cavendish Laboratory  and eventually to a share in the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1979.<br />These talks provide a wealth of background insights into some of the most significant advances in modern science. No summary or paraphrase can do justice to the engaging personal voices which speak from it.  This is a book to read with pleasure, and one to re-read, if you can get it back from the person who borrowed it.logy for a change of direction.

It will probably become a standard reference for courses in the history and philosophy of science so its strengths and its weaknesses will become the common property of some generations of students. Thereore its shortcomings need to be identified and sharply criticised.<br />Chief among its many good features is the broad sweep \\"from Plato to NATO\\". This corrects the limited scope of much that is written on the philosophy of science, as though the subject started with T. S. Kuhn, or John Stuart Mill or Francis Bacon. The reward for Oldroyds ambition will be much criticism from specialists who are unhappy with the treatment handed out to their favorite person.<br />He provides a clear description of the scientific problem situation at critical stages to illuminate the philosophical debates that raged around them. We often read that Eddington's observations on the 1919 eclipse made a decisive contribution to the argument between Newtonian physics and relativity; Oldroyd provides a diagram to show what had to be measured and why. The account is humanised by means of brief biographical notes on important and captivating figures such as Russell and Wittgenstein.<br />The arch is the central motif of the book, depicting the relationship between the 'ground' of experience and the high level generalities of science. The 'upward' or 'inductive' limb of the arch attempts to trace a path from the raw data of experience to the general laws. The other limb leads downwards by means of deductive logic and mathematics to predictions for technological application of theories, or for testing.<br />A central organising principle of some kind is needed to handle the huge bulk of material within Oldroyd's compass and he uses the arch to good effect as far as it goes. But it does not go far enough and it breaks down when Oldroyd comes to the work of Sir Karl Popper (1902-94). Alone among the philosophers from Plato to the present day he has a whole chapter to himself but Oldroyd concludes.<br />\\"I think it has to be said that falsificationism, and Popper's account of the 'logic' of scientific method, have to be accounted as failures...there is really no more certainty in the process of falsification than in the process of verification or induction. Indeed, as recent commentators such as David Stove have shown, the whole logic of falsification is something of a shambles\\".<br />This statement is absurd, though it probably represents the received opinion in the mainstream of academia. Popper was never usefully defined as a 'falsificationist', and he never claimed certainty in the process of testing; he simply pointed out that there is a logical asymmetry between verification and falsification, also that testing (attempted falsification) is the most effective way to use evidence to advance the growth of knowledge.<br />The architectural image of the arch has led Oldroyd astray in dealing with Popper's ideas because these call for a fundamental revision of the architectural metaphors which philosophers habitually use, in their talk of 'foundations of belief', 'grounding' theories in experience and the like. On Popper's account science has no foundations and the more appropriate image for knowledge is that of a helium or hot-air balloon. Knowledge is driven forward (upward) by the hot air of conjectures which are then subjected to criticisms, including experimental tests. The data of observation and experience are not foundations, instead they are mooring lines which keep the balloon of theoretical knowledge tethered to the \\"earth\\" of the real world instead of floating away like pseudoscience or metaphysics.<br />Oldroyd's survey ends with the 'post-Popperian' historical/sociological accounts of knowledge that derive from the work of Lakatos, Kuhn, Feyerabend and others. He noted the appearance in 1982of the three volumes of Popper's The Postscript to The Logic of Scientific Discovery but he did not draw upon their contents. This is unfortunate because the Metaphysical Epilogue to the third volume sketches Popper's theory of \\"metaphysical research programmes\\" which unifies and<br />illuminates much that he has written on topics ranging from quantum physics to the theory of democracy. The idea of \\"research programmes\\" reached the world outside the London School of Economics in the rather unhelpful form that Lakatos created by merging the ideas of Popper and Kuhn. This gained Lakatos world-wide repute and it has confused both friends and enemies of Popper.<br />Oldroyd is sympathetic to the modern 'sociology of knowledge' approach but he might have done more to show how views of science have diffused into the culture at large, colouring theories of creativity, imagination and literature. For example the triumph of Newtonian mechanics, supposedly based on the Baconian method of induction (accumulation of facts) a continuing revolt by romantics, led by William Blake, against the common view of science, producing in turn a schizophrenic disjunction between imagination and reason, between the inspiration of the poet and the empiricism of the scientist. But as Popper wote \\"Science, after all, is a branch of literature...Labouring the difference between science<br />and the humanities has long been a fashion, and has become a bore. The method of problem solving, the method of conjecture and refutation is practiced by both\\".<br />The hypothetico-deductive scheme, foreshadowed by Whewell, Jevons and Peirce in the 19th century, and completed by Popper in the 20th was described by Sir Peter Medawar in Pluto's Republic as the most important methodological discovery of modern thought. This is a large claim and it remains to be properly tested. Can Popper's ideas help us to take a firmer grip on 'this thing called Science', to use it for our advantage and to prevent its fruits from destroying us?<br />Oldroyd's book will not do much for Popper's reputation but that is a matter that can be put to rights elsewhere. The Arch of Knowledge is a pleasure to read and it brings together a wealth of ideas in a form that is accessible to the interested non-specialist. This is a valuable achievement and one that many more academics could usefully emulate.2 of the three volumes of Popper's The Postscript to The Logic of Scientific Discovery but he did not draw upon their contents.

It  is  concerned  with  problem-solving  and  error elimination  under  various  forms  of  selective  pressure,  in contrast  with  schools of thought which are concerned  with  the justification  of beliefs or the explication of concepts.<br />The major emphasis in this book is on the biological  line of thought,  with some attention to  William  W. Bartley's  work on rationality.  The articles were not originally planned for  this volume; most are based on papers delivered at a series of seminars during the early 1980s and some are much older pieces  that  are  reprinted  because  they  make  a  specially significant  contribution  to  evolutionary  epistemology.  The volume  stands  in need of an introduction  to make  visible  the skeleton  of ideas that provides a  degree of coherence to  the collection.  The absence of this guide will create  some problems for people who are not familiar with evolutionary epistemology in general,  and with Popper's work in particular .  For more on this, google on Rathouse+Popper or Rathouse+Bartley.<br />In Part I the philosophers William W.  Bartley and Rosaria Egidi,  the scientists Gunter Wachterhauser and Gerhard Vollmer,  and the psychologist  Donald  Campbell,  together with  Popper,  contribute  eight chapters which make up almost half the book.  Bartley criticises a  version of subjectivism or idealism (\\"the world is my  dream\\") which he labels 'presentationalism'.  His critique is relevant to all those epistemologies which equate knowledge with true belief, though few are prepared to follow the consequences with the rigor of presentationalists such as Ernst Mach (1838-1916.)  Mach  argued that  there  is no such thing as a real tree,  out there  in  the garden,  because when we claim to see it, what we actually see is an image of a tree as it is presented to our mind  by our sensory and  cognitive apparatus.<br />This anthropomorphic account  of  the external  world  can  be criticised  on biological grounds,  as Bartley does in a  section  titled \\"About a frog,  idealistically disposed\\".  Frogs  register only  four  kinds  of visual effects because only four  types  of signal  can  be sent to their brains.  These visual effects are  sufficient  to enable  frogs  to  perform tasks such as  catching  small  moving objects  and leaping towards dark spaces if a  predator  appears.  The  world  of the frog,  as a projection of its  limited  visual capacity,  is very impoverished  and not one that we would accept as  the  full  story even, with our  own  fairly  limited  senses. Yet  a presentationalist frog  would claim that the world  consists only of the contrasts, the small dark objects, the moving shadows and  sudden  dimming of light which it perceives.  Thus it  would ignore  the  possibility that its knowledge of the world  is  not 'given'  but  is the product of the evolved  sense  organs  which reflect  some,  but  not all,  aspects of the world  which  frogs inhabit.  This  view might seem absurd if it  were advanced by  a frog,  but  its  human equivalent dominates Western  philosophy, with apparent support from the findings of modern physics.<br />Bartley  suggests that the roots of the theory that he labels  presentationalism<br />\\"may  be  not  only  deep  but  psychological,  and  even metaphysical...for it seems to me that  philosophers of science do not  ordinarily choose presentationalism;  rather they are driven to  it by certain deep structural assumptions that permeate  most of western philosophy.\\"<br />Among  those  assumptions which he identifies are  reductionism, determinism and positivism. These theories, with some others of a more  technical  nature  such  as  instrumentalism  (theories  are nothing but instruments) and subjectivist interpretations of  the calculus  of  probability,  constitute what could be calledthe dominant  framework  of Western  thought,  especially  scientific thought.  The  basic  assumptions  that  support  evolutionary epistemology contradict the old framework  at almost every point. Hence it is possible to detect a \\"new program\\" for western philosophy, with the following elements: non-justificationism, objectivism, non-determinism and non-reductionism.<br />Part  II  treats Bartley's ideas. He has the first and last word, with John F.  Post (three short pieces),  John W. N. Watkins  and Gerhard Radnitzky sandwiched in between.  The point of departure is  the  theory of rationality and the limits of criticism  which Bartley advanced in The Retreat to Commitment.  Bartley's  theory  of rationality  generalizes Popper's critique of the notion  that  a belief  is  nothing  if it is  not  positively  justified.  This  approach abandons the quest for  positive justification and instead  settles for  a critical preference  for  one  option rather  than  others,  in  the light of  critical  arguments  and evidence  offered  up  to  that  point.  As  Radnitzky  puts  it, \\"Questions  of  acceptance  are  replaced  by  questions  of preference\\".  Many people are likely to regard this result  as  a purely verbal 'solution' to the problem of justification,  merely shifting  the  problem from the source of justification  to  the source  of  critical  preference.  But  the shift  is  from  the impossible  task  of justification to  productive tasks  such  as  exploring  the  types  of criticism that  can  be  used  to  form  critical preferences.<br />Part  III  of  the volume, titled \\"Rationality  and  the Sociology of Knowledge, \\"  branches off in various directions with essays from Peter Munz,  Antony Flew and Bartley  (again).  Munz responds to Richard  Rorty's Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, which  contends that philosophers should not try to compete  with scientists  in  solving  problems but,  instead,  should  sustain  elegant conversations.  Munz shows that Rorty  has ignored evolutionary  epistemology  as  an alternative  to  the  'mirror' theory  that  the mind passively copies the world  (which  Rorty rejects)  and  to the  appeal to a select community of peers  for settling knowledge claims (which Rorty apparently accepts).stitute what could be called  the dominant  framework  of Western  thought,  especially  scientific thought.

US	49163407	RUCSDN94REVUC	0819178233	75498064	The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism	Books	4	79	84	N	N	Breaking new ground	The American theologian Michael Novak converted from socialism to capitalism in the 1970s, somewhat against the trend of the times. It might be said that he got in early to beat the rush to the neoconservative right. He has written that his liberal humanist education, mostly in philosophy and theology, was anti-capitalist 'as was common'. At the age of 40 he recognized a need to question his presuppositions about political economy and especially economics. This led him to discover and eventually to celebrate  democratic capitalist traditions and institutions, especially in their North American form. He is especially proud of the achievements of the founding fathers of the Constitution with their appreciation of the need to separate the powers of church and state, and to take precautions against the predatory  activities of political factions.<br />In his capacity as a Catholic theologian he has been especially concerned to reply to the moral critics of capitalism who typically argue that the system abandons the public interest and the welfare of the community to self-interest and the pursuit of individual gain. In one of his other books, Free Persons and the Common Good, he attempted to retrieve from the Catholic literature a conception of the common good that is consistent with capitalism and the market order. Novak taook up this challenge with a tortuous excursion into the works of Catholic thinkers, among them Aquinas who Lord Acton described as 'the first Whig'.<br />His account of the American experience as an adventure of classical (non socialist) liberalism is more convincing. He identifies several valuable moral traditions which were called forth by democratic capitalist institutions in the early American colonies. These include civic responsibility, personal economic enterprise, creativity and a special kind of communitarian living. He also offers a cogent rejoinder to the critics who accuse capitalism of lacking moral or spiritual depth. He explains that statements on the 'spiritual deficiency' of democratic capitalism spring from a \\"horrific\\" category mistake. Democratic capitalism is not a church, a philosophy or a way of life, instead it promises three liberations; from tyranny and torture; from the oppression of conscience, information and ideas; and from poverty. The resulting social order provides space \\"within which the soul may make its own choices, and within which spiritual leaders and spiritual associations may do their own necessary and creative work\\". He suggests that Democratic capitalism has done rather well on the score of promoting spiritual and cultural life, in contrast with Fascism and Communism which aspired to cater for higher human needs.<br />The most significant achievement of the book is to explain how the common good can be served by the blend of individualism and free-market institutionalism (under the rule of law) that is advocated by von Mises and Hayek. Both these writers and other classical liberals dismiss the notion that there is anything identifiable as the common (collectivist) good. But the kind of 'common good' that Novak identifies is not of the collectivist variety, instead it is a framework of institutions and traditions which maximises the chance for all individuals to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This particular kind of common good is promoted by the extended order of morals and markets, provided that the markets and other vital parts of the system of law and government are working properly. Here the notion of the rule of law is crucial because it defines an essential function for strong (but limited) government.<br />Novak supports the market liberal thrust for free trade and he also endorses the traditional, conservative notion of the rule of law against certain types of social engineers and judicial activists. However he does not object to the welfare state because he thinks that it is necessary in these days of fragmented communities and highly mobile people. Those who like their ideology strong and pure will deplore this lapse from grace but it shows Novak's willingness to get the best of both worlds, if this is at all possible. In the same way that he is determined to retrieve the best of Catholic theology he is prepared to take whatever he finds acceptable from the diverse strands of liberalism, ranging  from the laissez-faire of von Mises and the deregulators to the  left-liberalism of the American democrats. Novak challenges libertarians who have no time for religious traditions and he challenges religious conservatives who regard the liberal tradition as self-centred. This book maintains his reputation for breaking new ground and making connections between apparantly antagonistic modes of thought.ile people.

It  includes a number of  seminal papers which were delivered as talks to bodies such as the British Rationalist (Humanist) Association and the Mont Pelerin Society. There is also Popper's first paper written in English \\"What is Dialectic\\", delivered at a seminar in 1937 soon after he arrived in New Zealand.<br />Possibly the most important offering is the Introduction \\"On the Sources of Knowledge and of Ignorance\\" which explored the common roots of authoritarian thinking in western epistemology and politics. In each case the fundamental issues have been skewed by asking the wrong questions: \\"What is the authority for our beliefs?\\" And \\"Who should rule?\\" Thus attention has focused on unanswerable questions in both epistemology and politics, diverting attention from the real and practical issues of  criticism in epistemology and the limitation and control of power in politics and public administration. This paper also prompted William W Bartley's seminal thinking on rationality and the limits of  criticism.<br />\\"The Nature of Philosophical Problems and their Roots in Science\\" suggested that the prima facie method of teaching philosophy denied access to the roots of philosophical problems and produced students who are either narrowly specialized in technical fields or are trained to reproduce material recycled form their teachers. He suggested that philosophy would die if its extra-philosophical roots decayed and he backed his case with a sketch of Plato's response to the crisis in early Greek atomism and the more modern example of Kant's response to Newton. This essay produced an echo in the form of Agassi's subsequent paper on the roots of scientific problems in metaphysics.<br />On the topic of metaphysics, this collection contains Popper's \\"coming out\\" as a metaphysician in \\"On the Status of Science and of Metaphysics\\", heralding a development that culminated in the Metaphysical Epilogue to \\"The Postscript to The Logic of Scientific Discovery\\".<br />\\"Back to the Presocratics\\" was delivered to the Aristotelian Society in 1958, an occasion that has been immortalised by Byran Magee in his memoires.

Richard Feynman achieved something like cult status, almost on a par with Stephen Hawking and for some time I resisted the temptation to read him. This was partly because physics is not my area of interest and also because Hawking was such a disappointment with his naïve belief that the final unified theory of everything would soon be invented. Also it seemed that the Hawking books are much bought but little read, thereby diminishing the status of cult figures in science writing.<br />On the way back from the Popper Centenary Conference, in the airport Frankfurt, curiosity won over skepticism, also I had a few euros to unload, so I took on board this collection of \\"best short works\\".  I now consider the euros well spent and Feynman fully deserving of respect and admiration.<br />Under the circumstances, with a satchel of Popper stuff from Vienna,  the most striking thing about Feynman was his relentlessly critical, imaginative and enthusiastic approach to everything, especially science. In short, he lived and breathed the philosophy of Karl Popper. That  might have surprised him because it is hard to say whether he had the most contempt for philosophers or for the soft social sciences.<br />Maybe Feynman is too hard on the social sciences. It is helpful to remember that physicists restrict their predictions to model systems, otherwise they settle for explanations in principle. We can explain in principle the trajectory of  leaves that fall off a tree but nobody would be expected to predict which ones will end up in the street and which will fly up on to the roof and block your gutter.  Similarly in some areas of  the social sciences (those that are not pure ideology and verbalism) we can predict tendencies,  such as increased prices due to import restrictions, without being able to predict the size of the increase due to the many other factors that are involved in setting prices.<br />Feynman had the incredible good fortune to be in the right place at the right time but that would not have worked if he did not have the capacity to do the right thing at the right time as well. Like all great artists and scientists, he was captivated by his work, so at times nothing else mattered. That saved him from nerves, even as youth, when he found himself lecturing to an audience that included Einstein and other great men in the field. His hands were shaking when he took his papers from the envelope to start talking . \\"Then something happened to me which has always happened since...If I'm talking physics , I love the thing, I think only about physics, I don't worry where I am; I don't worry about anything\\". This probably also saved him from being disabled by the impending death of his first wife who was fading away while he worked on the Big Bomb at Los Alamos.<br />His capacity to focus on the physics and not the audience made him an invaluable  foil for Bohr. Everyone else was so overawed by Bohr that they never challenged his ideas. \\"I was always  worried by the physics; if the idea looked lousy, I said it looked lousy...later Bohr said to his son `He's the only guy who is not afraid of me, and will say when I've got a crazy idea...when we want to discuss ideas, we're not  able to do it with these guys who say everything is yes, yes Dr Bohr. Get that guy first.'\\"<br />Like most collections of occasional pieces, there is a  tendency to repetition of key themes such as the uncertainty of all knowledge and the inferior nature of the social sciences.

US	49163407	RAJ0X85TSWXJ3	0688085997	919035001	Preferential Policies: An International Perspective	Books	5	14	14	N	N	A study of unintended consequences	In 1990 the Indian Government precipitated riots and episodes of self-immolation with a promise to provide more university places and public service jobs for the lower caste 'untouchables'. Readers of \\"Preferential Policies\\" will not find these events surprising because they have happened before in other countries following the introduction of preference policies.  Perhaps the most tragic example is the civil war in  Sri Lanka.<br />This book is a historical and comparative study of the strong form of affirmative action whereby the members of supposedly deprived or under-privileged groups become the beneficiaries of government-mandated preferences. These set aside the principles of merit and freedom of choice so that different  individuals are no longer judged by the same criteria or subjected to the same procedures.<br />Sowell describes the various patterns of behaviour and outcomes generated by preferential policies of different kinds. These include preferences for the economically dominant group (South Africa and the old US deep south), majority preferences in economies dominated by minorities (Malaysia, Sri Lanka,) and minority preferences in economies dominated by the majority (contemporary USA and India). The second part of the book explores the errors and muddled thinking which keep preferential policies in place even when they fail to produce the desired effects. Indeed, the very failure of policies which were supposed to be limited and temporary often leads to stronger preference initiatives.<br />Prior to Sowell's research it appears that hardly anyone paid systematic attention to the gap between the rhetoric and the reality of preference policies. Nor had anybody noticed the depressing similarity in the pattern of events which Sowell records all around the world. Generally the demand for preferential policies comes from well educated, 'new class' members of supposedly disadvantaged groups. The same people also become the main beneficiaries of preference policies which tend to further disadvantage the majority of their bretheren. This was clearly demonstrated in Malaysia where the gap between rich and poor Malays widened in the wake of preference policies for ethnic Malays.  A leading advocate of preference conceded the evidence but claimed that the poor Malays preferred to be exploited by their own people.<br />The most destructive result of preference policies is the polarization of whole societies, as in Sir Lanka, Nigeria (with the attempted Ibo breakaway movement to form Biafra) and some Indian states. The Sri Lankan experience is especially instructive because at the time of independence the Tamil minority and the Sinhalese majority lived side by side in harmony despite their different religions and languages and despite the greater educational and commercial advancement of a section of the Tamils. The elites of both groups tended to be English speaking, mixed freely with each other and were committed to non-sectarian policies. All this changed with one demagogue, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. English-speaking, Christian and Oxford-educated, he became a champion of the Sinhalese language, Budhism and preferential treatment for Sinhalese. This resulted in an upset electoral victory for his party in 1956, followed by legislation to make Sinhalese the official language, restriction of the leading teacher-training college to Sinhalese only, and the first of many bloody race riots directed against the Tamils. The downward spiral continued as radical Sinhalese elements demanded stronger forms of preference and groups of Tamils launched a violent secession movement.<br />If preferential policies do not work, then what is to be done to overcome prejudice and discrimination against particular groups? One way is to rely on  market forces backed up by the slow and steady effects of education and example. Of course this process is far too slow and unexciting to satisfy people who would happily see blood shed to realise their dreams.  However the power of market forces in this context is that prejudice is free but discrimination has a price. Sowell reports that the streetcar operators in many Southern cities initially defied the  'Jim Crow' legislation that required segregated transport. Something similar has come about in South Africa after some generations of apartheid enabled the 'poor whites' to rise above the black masses, so that some of the Africaners reached the business class.<br />'Some of the principal beneficiaries of apartheid became its critics, now that their new role as employers forced them to confront the costs of discrimination. The rise of influential business interests within the ruling Nationalist Party has been partly responsible for the slow but widespread erosion of apartheid that began in the 1970s'.<br />Australia only receives a brief mention as a country where preferential policies 'are still at the stage of optimistic predictions.' If the lessons of this book are assimilated they will remain in that situation. Affirmative action has not yet taken the form of quotas or positive discrimination on a significant scale.

On this criterion one would wonder why Cassandra Pybus bothered to research and write the story of James McAuley. Apart from a flicker of sympathy for the emotional coldness of his upbringing, this account is almost entirely lacking in empathy or understanding of McAuley's motivation and his strengths.<br />McAuley had at least three public faces: the poet, the scholar and the political/religious activist. It seems that Pybus has a tin ear for verse and so is unable to convey any sense of his achievements in that area. Instead she mines his poetry for symptoms of sexual, religious and political hangups. Religion has traditionally been a vehicle for the highest spiritual aspirations, but she is apparently tone deaf to this area of human experience as well.<br />The English historian and philosopher R G Collingwood deplored the decline of religion and the rise of the \\"Prussian philosophy\\" of political bullying. Obsessed with the rise of dictatorships in the 1930s he felt that democratic principles had lost the 'punch' that religious faith had once imparted to them. This amounts to a repetition of the mournful commentary by Yeats in his poem \\"The Second Coming\\":<br />Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br />Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world...<br />The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br />Are full of passionate intensity...<br />This was the situation confronted by McAuley when he turned from the romanticism and anarchism of youth to Catholicism and political engagement in the 1950s. It is the domain of politics where Pybus is most at home. Reporting on an address by McAuley at the University of Sydney she writes \\"It was not the poet I went to hear all those years ago. Then, as now, it was the political ideologist and cold war warrior who compelled my attention\\". Unfortunately her attention must have wandered, or maybe he said things she did not want to hear because she went on \\"I don't remember what it was he said\\".<br />Of course it is unreasonable to demand that McAuley's biographer should be a poet with religious sensibilities, however an academic historian should provide something more than a journalistic account of the work of Santamaria, Krygier and others who opposed communist influence in the trade unions, the Labor Party and the universities. Pybus provides no historical perspective on these activities. A younger generation of readers may need to be reminded that there was a cold war, sometimes more than cold, as in Korea, Malaya, Vietnam and other insurgencies, not to mention Hungary. During that time a hostile totalitarian power threatened peace and security all over the world, with its agents in the west, including Australia, being funded and directed from Moscow. Due to the treason of the intellectuals, who as Pybus pointed out, mostly supported the other side, those who did not, such as McAuley were called all manner of names.<br />McAuley was the first editor of the Austrlian quarterly named Quadrant, the Australian arm of the worldwide anti-communist Association for Cultural Freedom.  The magazine first appeared at the time that Hungarian refugees started to turn up in the West after escaping from Russian tanks in the streets of their home town. Many Australian communist left the party at that point, though the realities should have been apparent to well informed people from the 1930s, from Koestler's Darkness at Noon, from George Orwell's journalism and from the local waterside workers disruption of the allied war effort during the Hitler-Stalin pact.<br />It appears that Cassandra Pybus has missed the moral point of the anti-communist stand of the Quadrant supporters. They were a small part of the worldwide intellectual resistance to an aggressive dictatorship. As for the CIA funding to Quadrant which provided so much delight to Stalin's \\"useful idiots\\", itis unfortunate that Quadrant could not raise more funds locally but nobody has suggested the writers took their orders from overseas in the way that the communists did.<br />The outcome of the cold war remained in doubt until well after McAuley's death. The stakes were high and this no doubt contributed to the sense of urgency and impatience on the part of the McAuley and others, especially in the face of indifference or obstruction by people who should have known better. The final collapse of the Soviet empire surely revealed to the most empty-headed Vietnam Moratorium marcher that there was something rotten behind the Iron Curtain.<br />Pybus merely notes that McAuley was on the losing side in the 1970s. It should be added that this was mostly because the leadership in Australia and the US destroyed their moral credibility by introducing conscription for the Vietnam war. This was hardly McAuley's fault because he was a not a rightwinger of the coercive kind. He probably would have endorsed Hayek's statement \\"Why I am not a conservative\\" (Postscript to The Constitution of Liberty). A real conservative such as Malcolm Fraser (Prime Minister during the 1970s) showed his true colours when, in addition to supporting conscription and retrospective taxation, he cut back funding to Quadrant and raised the tariff barriers to impede free trade. A google search McAuley + Rathouse will turn up some helpful essays to illuminate his role in the poetry and politics of his time.<br />Defects in the research in this book have been documented by other reviewers who were closer to the action than myself. The embarrassing gesture towards homoeroticism as a spring of McAuley's motivation has been rubbished by commentators across the ideological spectrum.<br />Almost 100,000 dollars of public money went into this project and what is one to make of the expensive white elephant that has come off the press? As a taxpayer who unwittingly contributed to the funding I would like to ask for my money back. However if Cassandra Pybus is prepared to make the trip I would be willing to support research in the Moscow archives to document the flow of Soviet funds to the communist party in Australia and to fellow-travelling writers.s unfortunate that Quadrant could not raise more funds locally but nobody has suggested the writers took their orders from overseas in the way that the communists did.<br />The outcome of the cold war remained in doubt until well after McAuley's death.

The second is \\"The Sleepwalkes\\", on the contribution of Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo. The third is \\"The Ghost in the Machine\\", which contains a critique of behaviorist psychology and Koestler's theory to account for the apparent self-destructiveness of human nature.<br />\\"The Act of Creation\\" offers a theory to account for the \\"Ah Ha\\" reaction of scientific discovery, the \\"Ha Ha\\" reaction to jokes and the \\"Ah\\" reaction of mystical or religious insight. In each case the result is produced by a \\"bisociation of matrices\\" or the intersection of lines of thought which brings together hitherto unconnected ideas and fuses them into a creative synthesis. When the lines of thought are scientic the result is a scientific discovery, when they are concerned with devotional matters the result is mystical insight and when they are on a more homely plane the result can be a joke.<br />The model is fleshed out with a great deal of information ranging from the religions of the world to a theory about the nervous system to account for the build-up of tension and its discharge at the puchline of a joke. Peter Medawar's review was scathing in his comments on Koestler's science, which is a shame because the book can have the desirable effect of encouraging young scientists to read far beyond the usual range of their literature.	2002-08-05

They mocked too soon. Developments in the European Community, and some tendencies in the US after Septembe 11, demonstrate that Hayek's message remains valid and important.<br />Unfortunately Hayek's writing in parts of this book is rather stodgy and it is most surprising (though gratifying) that the book achieved such a high and continuing level of readership. For best results it should be read in tandem with Popper's &quot;The Open Society and its Enemies&quot;. This is easier to read and it has a very similar message with greater depth in some areas such as the philosophical roots of totalitarian thinking, the statement of critical rationalism and the correction of the muddle which Plato created by the false dichotomy of individualism and altruism.	2002-03-27

If you are not a conservative at 40 you don't have a brain\\".<br />Many people who are young at heart feel that the dreadful alternative to left-liberalism is some kind of cynical, crusty conservatism. Some conservatives reinforce that impression by their rigid and authoritarian views. The best part of this book is the essay at the end titled \\"Why I am not a conservative\\" because it dissolves that confusion of thought.<br />Differences within the \\"non-left\\" arise especially in two areas: (a) the use of state power to enforce moral principles and (b) the domain of economic policy. In each case the nub of the issue is the extent of state intervention that is appropriate.<br />Some economic liberals may need to be reminded that we do not live by bread and technology alone. Our lives gain meaning and purpose from the myths, moral values and traditions which constitute our non-material heritage. Economic liberals may sometimes appear to have little interest in these spiritual and cultural matters but this is not entirely true and the impression arises because they seldom see these things as part of the agenda of state policy. Here a basic principle is at stake because they do not aim to impose religious or cultural values, instead they wish to sustain \\"a type of order in which, even on issues which to one are fundamental, others are allowed to pursue different ends\\", as Hayek put it.<br />Turning to economic policy we find much conservative apprehension about the push for wholesale deregulation and privatisation. Socialists and many conservatives share a distrust of capitalism due to their failure to appreciate the function of markets and the nature of competition in the marketplace.<br />Over the last century or two, liberals of the classical (non-socialist) variety were forced into ad hoc alliances with conservatives to resist the socialist thrust of the Left. Consequently market liberalism became identified as a reactionary movement and hence the importance of this essay as a corrective to that view. Due to the compromises required for the liberal/conservative alliance in practical politics, the spirit of classical liberalism has languished to the point of death because no major political party in the Western world sustained it in a pure form.<br />The Rule of Law is a principle that conservatives might be expected to hold dear. But Hayek drew attention to \\"the characteristic complacency of the conservative toward the action of established authority and his prime concern that this authority be not weakened rather than that its power be kept within bounds. This is difficult to reconcile with the preservation of liberty\\". Some conservatives tend to share with socialists a willingness to recruit the power of the state to coerce others where the liberal would allow freedom of choice. Conscription for military service is a case in point.<br />In this book Hayek addresses a wide range of social and political issues to provide alternatives to traditional socialist and conservative views.

US	49163407	R1ARUYGTOKW979	0226320669	945922174	The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek)	Books	5	26	42	N	N	A brilliant but flawed jewel	This book signals a broadening of the classical liberal agenda into a range of cultural, historical and anthropological interests, beyond its traditional strongholds in philosophy and economics.<br />The book was the first volume of a major publishing program at the University of Chicago Press. The ten-year plan was to bring out a uniform set of twenty or more volumes of Hayek's collected works. The senior editor for the venture was William W Bartley who died shortly after this book appeared.<br />The main concern of the book is the continuing appeal of socialism among Western intellectuals despite its theoretical shortcomings and its failure in practice. Hayek defines the basic problem of the book as 'how does our morality emerge, and what implications may its mode of coming into being have for our economic and political life'.<br />Central to his case is the notion of an extended order of civilisation that is held together by the largely unconscious influence of traditional moral codes and practices. He has deployed the 'extended moral order' concept in his critique of socialists and central planners and their 'constructivist rationalism'. He proceeds by way of a reconstruction of Western history to explain the function of a number of moral rules, especially those that regulate dealings in private property, which he calls \\"several property\\". Other important rules concern honesty, contracts, exchange, trade and privacy. He undertakes some \\"conjectural history\\" to chart the origins of liberty, property and justice and the linked evolution of markets and civilisation.<br />With his conjectural history in place, Hayek then describes the revolt of the modern socialists against the discipline (and the opportunities) of the extended order. This revolt has two bases; one is instinctive or 'atavistic', the other is a perversion of reason that Hayek calls 'constructivist rationalism'. He claims that the instinctive resistance to the extended order of capitalism arises from the conflict between the \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" moral codes. However, against this essentially psychological thesis it is more likely that the attraction of socialism comes from the conjunction of several strands of thought. One of these is the tradition of utopian social thought which can be traced from Plato. Second is the tradition of helping the weak, which in the West is essentially the moral legacy of Christianity. Third, a cluster of ideas in political economy including the utopianism and centralism noted above, combined with the egalitarian aim of shifting wealth from the haves to the have-nots (inspired partly by the Christian ethos of helping the poor).<br />While the ideas of the first and third kind are well worthy of criticism the tradition of helping the weak is important and valuable, and needs to be sustained. Unfortunately there has been a growing movement in modern times to recruit the state to perform this function, in place of private charity. Therefore it is plausible to argue, against Hayek, that the moral force of socialism derives not from primitive emotional sources but from the fact that it recruits the power of Christian charity with its drive to help the poor and the weak. The tragedy of socialism is that the means do not achieve the objective.<br />Hayek's critique of reason is distinctly ambiguous and it is no more satisfactory than his psychological critique of socialism. His target is \\"constructivist rationalism\\", expressed in the view that blueprints for social engineering can be derived from concepts of society and its destination which form by a rational process in the minds of individuals or members of elite groups. An earlier critique of this stance occurs in \\"The errors of constructivism\\", a 1970 paper reprinted in his \\"New Studies in Philosophy, Politics, Economics and the History of Ideas\\". At this stage in his thinking the individual still retained a high degree of autonomy and the critical function assigned to human reason was compatible with an evolutionary approach that recognized the significance of tradition.<br />This view of the critical role of reason is restated very briefly in \\"The Fatal Conceit\\", but so briefly and adjacent to so much argument in favour of the benefits of submitting to tradition that the impression is one of confusion. This is unfortunate because a very important (and reasonable) conception of the function of moral and political philosophy emerges from Hayek's work, and from that of Popper in \\"The Open Society and its Enemies\\". This is the view that the task of moral and political philosophers is to discover, formulate and critically probe the implications of those principles which function as the \\"rules of the game\\" in social life.<br />This approach would supplement the methods of conceptual analysis and crude 'positivist' empirical description of social and political systems. It would have the theoretical advantage of linking disciplines and the practical merit of being continually in touch with problems and their possible solutions. This is consistent with the thrust of Hayek's previous work.

US	49163407	RE5FCPLRC0WTZ	0043303293	523830857	The Foundation of Economic Method	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Getting at the core of neoclassical economic theory	In this book Lawrence Boland critically explores the agenda of the neoclassical research program, especially some of the unstated assumptions of the \\"hidden agenda\\" which are seldom subjected to scrutiny. This approach is \\"imminent criticism\\", working within the assumptions of the system to explore their consistency and the capacity of the system to succeed on its own terms. \\"External\\" or \\"transcendent\\" criticism takes issue with the assumptions, working outside the system. These could be respectively called the \\"worm\\" and \\"sparrow\\" approach. This is written without prejudice against worms for which, like Charles Darwin, I have a high regard.<br />There is so little discussion of methodology among economists that some detective work is required to locate the methodological ideas that are at work. Boland was determined to identify the actual practice in the profession, as distinct from the incantations that are offered in the early part of textbooks.<br />He suggests that the hidden agenda of the field consists of two related but autonomous problems; first, the Problem of Induction; second, the Explanatory Problem of Individualism. These are explored in chapters 1 and 2. Their influence on research programs in neoclassical economics is pursued in chapters 3 to 6. Their influence on the practice of methodology in the field is presented in chapters 7 to 9. Alternative approaches are examined in chapters 10 to 12.<br />As to the Problem of Induction, this has mostly been shifted to the Problem of Conventionalism: \\"the problem of finding generally accepted criteria upon which to base any contingent, deductive proof of any claim to empirical 'knowledge'\\". In practice, the generally accepted criteria have produced a form of normal science where the puzzles are concerned either with econometric models or mathematical models. In the first instance, the requirements of science are met by using data, with some talk about falsification, confirmation and the like. In the second instance the criteria run along the lines of simplicity, economy, elegance and other considerations of mathematics.<br />Moving on to the other leg of the agenda, the Explanatory Problem of Individualism, otherwise known as Methodological Individualism (MI), this is the view that only individuals can be the decision-makers in any explanation of social events. Boland explains that the usual form that MI takes in the neoclassical research program is psychologism, \\"the prescription that psychological states are the only exogenous [unexplained] variables permitted beyond natural givens (weather, contents of the universe, etc)\\".<br />The bottom line of the argument here is that psychologism is retained because it is a part of the Conventionalist program to deal with the problem of induction. Boland turns to Popper as a corrective to inductivism. His views came to economists in the unhelpful form of \\"falsificationism\\" and various forms of his ideas are attributed to both Friedman and Samuelson, who are probably the most influential \\"methodologists\\" in the profession. However any celebrations about the Popperian triumph would be premature, because Conventionalism and Instrumentalism reign supreme in economics and Popper rejected both.<br /><br />Boland usefully notes some soft spots in Popper's work, especially the over-emphasis on the demarcation problem and some work on degrees of corroboration, described as a source of intellectual fog. He then turns to explore what it would mean for an inclusion of Popper's methodology in the hidden agenda of neoclassical economics. The problem of induction would be eliminated and with it the excessive concern with choosing between competing theories. Instead there would be more exploration of alternative solutions to theoretical problems.<br />Proceeding to the second item on the hidden agenda, methodological individualism, Boland's move here is from psychologism to consider the theories (and especially the plans and the strategies) that are held by decision-makers. For example it makes a difference whether an economic actor is using a maximising strategy, a minimum risk strategy or a satisficing strategy.<br /><br />\\"We wish to show here that by dropping Inductivism and Conventionalism and instead relying on Popper's views of knowledge and learning, the way is open to the development of real-time explanations in neoclassical theory\\".<br /><br />He suggests four agenda items for a \\"Popper-Hayek\\" program of individualistic explanation of dynamic processes. 1, Anti-justificationism. 2, Anti-psychologism. 3, Rational decision-making, according to the \\"logic of the situation\\". 4, Situational dynamics - behavior can change as a result of learning as well as from changes in the situation.<br /><br />He notes that Hayek's point about the importance of learning has been taken but has been blunted by persisting elements of inductivism, as though we just need more information of a different kind (concerning the psychology of actors) rather than a different explanatory model.<br />This book is packed with arguments that require close attention and defy adequate summary. If these arguments are robust then the book is a \\"white dwarf\\" that will exert enduring influence when it is more widely read and understood. This process will be assisted by a wider familiarity with Popper's thoughts on metaphysical research programs which coincidentally emerged in the same year as the first edition of this book (1982, in \\"Quantum Theory and the Schism in Physics\\").<br />The book is at present being revised for a new edition and it will be interesting to see how it is changed and improved after 20 years of work in the field, including some interesting experiences at the hands of journal editors and conference organizers. No comment on Boland's work would be complete without a tribute to his friend and teacher, Joske Agassi, who introduced him to the \\"Socratic Popper\\".that are held by decision-makers.

It contains original scholarship of a high order and it also serves as a primer on some central aspects of contemporary liberal thought, with a luminous introduction to the theory of spontaneous orders, a critique of Hayek on liberty, and a searching analysis of Hayek's conservatism compared with that of Oakeshott and Scruton.<br />Kukathas advances two theses. The minor one asserts that Hayek provides a comprehensive social doctrine, which should engage the close attention of both the critics and the defenders of classical (non-socialist) liberalism. However it appears that Hayek falls short of the full statement that is required to identify the limits of individual freedom and the proper scope of government.<br />The major thesis concerns the grounds of classical (non-socialist) liberalism. Kukathas argues that Hayek's defence rests on presuppositions that are incompatible: on the one hand, the scepticism and moral relativity of Hume; on the other, Kant's quest for rationally justified foundations of belief. The tension between these contrary tendencies emerges time after time as Kukathas explores Hayek's views on the key issues in political philosophy.<br />In his capacity as a conservative and sceptic Hayek asserts that ethics is not a matter of choice because \\"our morals are not (and cannot be) the product of design but are the result of a natural selection of traditions.\\" However the traditionalist Hayek is driven to seek reasons for adhering to traditional morality and he has a rationalist's concern to defend principles such as the market order and the rule of law that are required for his vision of human progress. But to pursue these principles he is obliged to adopt an agenda of radical reform to \\"free the process of spontaneous growth from the obstacles and encumbrances that human folly has erected.\\" But if these obstacles belong to our traditional heritage, then where do we stand to put the lever of reform under them? Tensions of this kind prompt Kukathas' conclusion that the foundations of Hayek's liberalism will not hold.<br />This conclusion begs the question that Kukathas raises in his final chapter on modern liberalism. \\"First, is it a defensible ideal and, secondly, how might it be defended?\\" These questions have taken on fresh urgency with Gray's announcement in the Postscript to his latest book that he has defected from liberalism due to its lack of rational foundations.  Kukathas concludes that liberal theorists should turn away from their preoccupation with uncovering Kantian foundations for liberalism, and look again to Hume.<br />Hume combined a critical temper of mind with respect for the truth and for valuable traditions. The challenge is to sustain Hume's critical mood without lapsing into the corrosive form of moral relativism, which denies that there is any rational way to choose between rival theories or moral principles. The usual rejoinder to this latter view is to insist (like Kant) that there is indeed some authoritative source of justified beliefs. Unfortunately, opinions differ on the appropriate authority and all such theories run into the problem of the limits of rationality (the dilemma of \\"the infinite regress versus dogmatism\\").<br />This arises as follows. If a belief claims validation by a supporting argument, what justifies the support? Where and how does the chain of justifications stop? If one attempts to provide reasons for the supporting argument then an infinite regress can be forced by anyone who presses for more supporting statements which in turn demand justification. It appears that this can only be avoided by an arbitrary decision to stop the regress at some stage and settle on a dogmatic belief at that point. This is Scruton's stance in renouncing the notion that any program of major reform can be justified, so that equality and freedom may be sacrificed to \\"the absolute claim of the locally given.\\"<br />The dilemma of the infinite regress arises from the widespread assumption that beliefs are only rational or valid if indeed they are positively (certainly) justified. The solution that is offered by Karl Popper and his late colleague William W. Bartley is to abandon the quest for positive justification. Instead we should settle for a critical preference for one option rather than others, in the light of arguments and evidence offered to that point. This stance allows for the revision of preferences in the light of new evidence or arguments, for unconscious acceptance of tacit beliefs (for the moment) and for the uncritical acceptance of beliefs that are not regarded as problematic (again for the moment). This appears to be a simple, commonsense position but it defies the dominant traditions of Western thought which are mostly concerned with theories of justification. If the stance of \\"critical preference\\" is adopted then the tension between the Humean and Kantian tendencies in Hayek's thought may be resolved.<br />With his foundational problems in order then some of the difficulties in the body of his work may dissolve in turn. For example, the cluster of liberal policies (free trade, limited government, the rule of law etc) may be held on the grounds of critical preference over their rivals, given the larger objectives of peace, freedom and prosperity. Such a preference does not rest on faith or foundations, merely on the evidence of centuries of conscious or unconscious experimentation.<br />Hayek and Modern Liberalism is a significant addition to the growing volume of Hayek scholarship. It seems that Hayek's ideas are starting to receive the kind of attention that they deserve, after many years of neglect.infinite regress arises from the widespread assumption that beliefs are only rational or valid if indeed they are positively (certainly) justified.

The 20 years was the time from the original publication of \\"Logik\\". It eventually became almost 50 years. For various reasons publication was delayed until William W. Bartley undertook the task of editing the large manuscript. At last The Postscript appeared in three volumes (with further additions) in 1982 and 1983. Volume 1 is \\"Realism and the Aim of Science\\", volume 2 is \\"The Open Universe: An Argument for Indeterminism\\" and volume 3 is \\"Quantum Theory and the Schism in Physics\\".<br />This is probably the least enjoyable of Popper's works, though it offers an important corrective to the widespread idea that Popper's ideas were superseded by Kuhn and Lakatos. In the first part, \\"The Critical Approach\\" Popper replies to Kuhn and Lakatos and shows that they never really offered significant criticisms (or alternatives) to the critical approach or to Popper's theory of conjectural objective knowledge. They did identify some problems with \\"falsification\\" and these were widely regarded as serious criticisms of Popper's ideas, even though he had recognized the problems some decades before and answered them. For example, Popper had always realised that falsification was only logically decisive (in a way that verification was not) because in real life observations are fallible and they need to be interpreted in the light of theories.<br />In the second part of the book Popper outlines his thoughts on the propensity interpretation of probability. This is his effort to overcome the defects of subjective theories of probability and the challenge of providing a theory of the probability of single events. This is an important but technical area of his work which some people find engrossing and others approach with a kind of mental block.

The intention of the author was to draw out both the strengths and limitations of Popper's work from the perspective of a critical admirer. This stance has enabled him to identify some aspects of Popper's work that are generally neglected, especially the moral dimension of his thought which Williams regards as a pervasive unifying principle. He also notes that virtually nothing has been written about Popper's defence of the cultural ideals of Western society and a major aim of the book is to show \\"the sustaining unity and power of Popper's vision\\" as it runs through his work in cosmology, philosophy, science, history and politics.<br />Despite these promising indications, the results are disappointing. This is not because Williams dissents radically from many salient features of Popper's philosophy. These disagreements, from a professed admirer of Popper's achievement, should be challenging and illuminating. The problem is that Williams does not provide the arguments and the evidence that are required to make his objections convincing, or to drive the discussion to a deeper level. Inconsistencies and inaccuracies abound. What is one to make of an author who on page 164 rebukes Popper for his 'failure to apppreciate the ideal of the good life in a free and egalitarian society', having previously (p 15) quoted from Popper's Unended Quest 'For nothing could be better than living a modest, simple, and free life in an egalitarian society...'?<br />Williams comments that Popperian exegesis has polarised between disciples and vehement critics. It appears that he has achieved a balance of a kind by occupying each extreme in turn. In one mode he writes:<br />'During the last four decades, and spanning a seemingly endless number of fields of inquiry, Popper has established himself as one of the most significant thinkers of our century...Few thinkers in our century have possessed the intellectual powers, the courage, and the faith in humanity necessary to sustain such a project. Bertrand Russell is perhaps the last that comes to mind'(viii).<br />In the critical mode he raises myriad objections, large and small, to Popper's psychology, his epistemology, and his politics, concluding that some of Popper's ideas, especially his concept of rationality, are not consistent with the maintenance of human freedom and autonomy.<br />Williams digs deep to locate the roots of Popper's ideas. He suggests that Popper followed Kant's defence of human dignity and moral autonomy against the twin threats of mechanistic determinism (Newton) and skepticism (Hume.) This is a fertile formulation that could have led directly to an account of Popper's responses to these threats, namely indeterminism, fallibilism, a non-authoritarian theory of knowledge and a limited 'non-justificationist' theory of rationality. Instead, Williams embarks on an account of the rise of science and the battle to maintain a sense of enchantment in a culture of science and technocratic politics. The remaining chapters examine Popper's methodology for the natural sciences (Chapter 4), his prescriptions for the social sciences (Chapter 5) and his defence of liberalism (Chapter 7 and Chapter 8). Chapter 6 defends Mannheim from some Popperian criticism.<br />One of Williams's problems is that he has tried to achieve too much in 200 pages. This tendency is especially apparent in Chapter 4, where in less than thirty pages he covers the development of most of Popper's leading ideas in epistemology and the philosophy of science. This is too densely packed for an introduction and it is likely to confuse people who come to the book in search of Popper's social philosophy. At the end of the chapter Williams changes from the descriptive to the critical mode and delivers an essentially negative verdict on Popper's psychology and also his epistemology.<br />In Williams' conclusion, he wrote that his aim was to faithfully reconstruct the unity of Popper's vision by pursuing an 'immanent critique'. That is, 'criticism of a man or woman's thought is held to flow from his or her own assumptions and values' (185). He wanted to improve on the excessively specialised and polemical nature of most of the commentary on Popper's work. This is a worthy aim but not one that Williams achieved, possibly because he did not make use of Bartley's account of the 'metacontextual shift' generated by Popper's non-authoritarian theory of knowledge and politics. Consequently Williams has been unable to do justice to Popper's epistemology and its cultural implications.<br />A similar problem has apparently occurred with Williams' critique of Popper's politics, especially Popper's views on the limited, protective role of the state. Williams has promulgated some very misleading statements, on Popper's views about the role of technocrats and social engineering, for example. This is a situation where the imminent critique may need to be supplemented by an account of Williams' own assumptions and values because they have apparently influenced his adverse comments on Popper.<br />The result is a book containing a confusing mixture of praise and criticism. If the criticisms were valid, Williams' high opinion of Popper would appear to be unwarranted. For the most part they are not valid, and one wonders how some of the more spectacular misreadings survived the screening of all the helpers he acknowledged. One also wonders what kind of impression this book will make on people who have not read Popper. Clearly the best thing that can happen will be for people to read some of the books and make up their own minds on the problems and issues raised by Williams.tially negative verdict on Popper's psychology and also his epistemology. <br />In Williams' conclusion, he wrote that his aim was to faithfully reconstruct the unity of Popper's vision by pursuing an 'immanent critique'.

I want to specify the kinds of effort that lie behind the development of the sociological imagination; to indicate its implications for political as well as for cultural life.\\"<br />The first chapter of this book is \\"The Promise\\" and in it Mills takes his stand with the great tradition of the Enlightenment and the idea of liberation by learning. For Mills, the promise is that cultivation of the sociological imagination may enable people to place personal worries and concerns in the larger social and historical context, and thus to think more effectively about them.<br />Chapters on Grand Theory and Abstracted Empiricism show how the understanding of social processes is impeded by immersion in certain types of theory and in narrow-minded \\"nomal science\\". Other chapters explore the many and varied ways that the critical and probing \\"sociological imagination\\" can be subverted or frustrated. His description of the Machieavellian tactics employed by academics to sideline rivals is especially revealing (for example, have a potentially dangerous book reviewed by a junior member of a hostile faction). His comments on the function of professional associations and conferences are equally deadly.<br />The fatal flaw of the book is Mill's Marxism and lack of understanding of economics, exemplified by his dismissive reference to people who could not see the value of the New Deal. The author's theoretical and ideological stance is not explicitly articulated but was clearly in the rational and humanistic Marxist tradition. He yearned for a viable alternative to liberalism and Marxism as he saw them in the 1950s but he clearly did not perceive classical liberalism as a candidate that was worthy of mention. It seems that classical, non-socialist liberals were so thin on the ground during his lifetime that he did not see any need to engage with them. That is a major weakness and it prevented Mills, and this book, from reaching the full extent of insight and understanding that his scholarship, his integrity and his industry should have permitted.<br />The Appendix on Intellectual Craftmanship is worth reading every few years to keep focussed for effective reading, thinking and writing. The remainder of this review consists of extracts from the appendix to convey some of its flavour.<br />\\"It is best to begin, I think, by reminding you, the beginning student, that the most admirable thinkers within the scholarly community you have chosen to join do not split their work from their lives.They seem to take both too seriously to allow such dissociation, and they want to use each for the enrichment of the other.\\"<br />\\"You must set up a file, which is, I suppose, a sociologist's way of saying: keep a journal...In such a file as I am going to describe, there is joined personal experience and professional activities, studies under way and studies planned...\\"<br />\\"One of the very worst things that happens to social scientists is that they feel the need to write of their 'plans' on only one occasion: when they are going to ask for money for a specific piece of research or 'a project'. It is as a request for funds that most 'planning' is done, or at least written carefully about. However standard the practice, I think this very bad: it is bound in some degree to be salesmanship, and, given prevailing expectations, very likely to result in painstaking pretensions; the project is lilely to be presented', rounded out in some arbitrary manner long before it ought to be; it is often a contrived thing, aimed at getting the money for ulterior purposes, however valuable, as well as for the research presented.\\"<br />\\"Any working social scientist who is well on his way ought at all times to have so many plans, that is to say ideas, that the question is always, which of them am I, ought I, to work on next. And he should keep a special file for his master agenda, which he writes and rewrites just for himself and perhaps for discussion with friends. From time to time he ought to review this very carefully and purposefully, and sometimes too, when he is relaxed.\\"<br />\\"Any such procedure is one of the indispensable means by which your intellectual enterprise is kept oriented and under control...In [a vigorous and free intellectual community]...there would be interludes of discussion among individuals about future work. Three kinds of interludes - on problems, methods, theory - ought to come out of the work of social scientists and lead into it again: they should be shaped by work-in-progress and to some extend guide their work.

Following his teacher, Karl Popper, the operating principle of Bartley's rationalism is the formula \\"I may he wrong and you may be right, and by means of critical discussion we may get nearer to the truth of the matter\\".<br />Bartley has offered a solution to the basic logical problem of rationality, the problem of  \\"the limits of criticism\\", that is, how to deal with a persistent critic, like a nagging child, who keeps asking \\"Why?\\" each time an answer is offered to a question. His response is based on Popper's identification of the authoritarian structure of western thought  which alerted Bartley to a previously undetected assumption (shared by rationalists and irrationalists alike and so not generally debated or even recognized), which he called \\"justificationism\\". It is summed up in the formula:<br />\\"Beliefs must be justified by an appeal to an authority of some kind (generally the source of the belief in question) and this makes the belief either rational, or if not rational, at least valid for the person who holds it.\\"<br />Among the contenders for authoritative status are \\"hard facts\\", \\"the light of reason\\", and the informed heart, logic, intuition, sacred traditions and innumerable religious authorities. In the Anglo-Saxon tradition of Empiricism the authority of sense experience was adopted, so \\"seeing is believing\\" and science provides the epitome of rational knowledge. In the Continental Rationalist tradition following Descartes the locus of authority resides with the intellectual intuition.<br />Having discovered the hidden premise of justificationism, Popper and Bartley proceeded to criticise it, showing that we can dispense with the aim of positive justification without giving up anything that really matters, such as respect for facts, for arguments, for the systematic use of reason to weigh and test the validity of beliefs and assumptions. This new theory of rationality is not a theory of justified belief, it is a theory of critical preference between options. We can form a preference for one option rather than another (whether for a car, a scientific theory or a political allegiance) in the light of evidence and arguments produced to that time. This preference may (or may not) he revised in the light of new evidence and arguments. It may be protested that this is not a great novelty, it is just commonsense. But historically, commonsense has proved no match for learned justificationist arguments.<br />The problem for rationalists is that the traditional dogmatic framework of thought guarantees that the irrationalists can always win, any time that they force the issue and demand that the rationalist produce truly justified beliefs.  In this way the dogmatic framework provides the seedbed for the weeds of irrationalism and this yields the shocking discovery that dogmatic (justificationist) theories of rationality actually nurture and maintain that seedbed. Hence there is nothing very surprising about the survival of irrationalism despite the onward march of science and the generally high regard for rationality in Western civilisation (Romantic reactions not withstanding). It seems that rationalists in the mould of Bertrand Russell nurture the seeds of their own destruction by persisting in the quest for justified beliefs and so helping to maintain the justificationist framework of thought.<br /><br />The story of \\"The Retreat to Commitment\\" began as a somewhat esoteric study of rationality in Protestant theology.<br />\\"This essay is a study of problems of self-identity and integrity in the Protestant and rationalist traditions. Probably the two most influential spiritual traditions of Western culture, both have helped provide involvement and purposive living in the past: and both offer their services to help overcome present-day alienation. However, these two traditions not only are internally confused but also are breeding confusion and alienation quite out of proportion to the internal confusion of either.\\"<br />Bartley sketched the evolution of liberal Protestant theology in the 19th and 20th centuries as non-fundamentalist Christians tried to retain both Christianity and rationality in the face of the rising tides of science and secularisation. Social reform was a dominant motif, inspired by the example of the historical Jesus but further research destroyed the image of the historical Jesus as a paragon of humanitarian virtues and goodwill. This posed a major threat for liberal, rational Protestants because Christians had to make a choice between a form of liberal Christianity without assent to the newly revealed non-liberal historical Jesus or a new form of Christianity, however irrational (and non-liberal) this may be.<br />Karl Barth started the new trend in Protestant theology by following the lead of Kierkegaard, who attacked rational, ethics-centered Christianity with a defence of the \\"absurd\\". His ideal Christian was not the liberal vision of the historical Jesus but Abraham who was prepared to sacrifice his beloved son, Isaac at God's command. To be a man of faith was to obey, blindly uncritically, without reason, absurdly. It is readily apparent that this position was unaffected by the collapse of the liberal version of the historical Jesus and Kierkegaard was revealed as a man long in advance of his time, in fact an existentialist, before the term was even invented.<br />Following the directions charted by Kirkegaard and Bath the new theologians accept that the Christian faith is based on an irrational commitment but they are secure in the knowledge that their critics, whether humanists or Marxists or Hindus cannot demonstrate a fully-justified rational basis for their criticism. They can always respond with the \\"boomerang\\" argument, the tu tuque \\"You too!\\" rejoinder. \\"Maybe I cannot justify my position, but you cannot justify yours either\\". This has been a great stand-by for people wishing to evade fundamental issues and of course it is based on the assumption of justificationism, which traditionally provides the invisible framework of debate. So the answer, following Bartley, is to widen the scope of the argument to encompass the traditional framework, to criticise and dispense with the assumption of justificationism itself.<br />More essays and reviews of Bartley can be found on line by a google search Bartley + Rathouse.n.

Books	5	25	25	N	N	A fine contribution from a quiet achiever	Peter Munz had the unusual distinction of being taught by Wittgenstein (in Cambridge) and Popper (in Christchurch, New Zealand). He has also earned the distinction of being a truly quiet achiever in developing his ideas on several fronts, including the implications and applications of Popper's thought.<br />This book takes the debate over Popper's ideas past the point where it bogged down on falsification and the problem of induction.  For some years after The Logic of Scientific Discovery appeared in 1959 critics offered two main lines of argument.  First, they pointed out that no falsification by empirical evidence could be decisive (for example, due to the fallibility of observational techniques), therefore the falsification criterion of science was useless.  Second, they claimed that scientific rationality depends on justification of theories and so Popper's theory of conjectural knowledge and his critique of inductive proof are twin daggers pointed at the heart of scientific rationality and a denial of the notion of scientific progress.<br />Popper and others replied that he had drawn attention to the limitations of falsification and his methodological strictures should be regarded as guidelines or conventions to maximise the exposure of theories to empirical tests.  As to inductive proof, Popper argued that this was defective on purely logical grounds and so the rationality of science had better depend on something else which he attempted to provide with a theory of conjectural knowledge which shows how knowledge can grow without ever being proved certain or even probable.<br />Munz explains how Popper's writing since the early 1960s has increasingly treated matters of biology and evolution.  This move supports the idea that rationality does not consist in the avoidance of errors but in the elimination of error and the correction of mistakes. In nature this occurs through the elimination of organisms and species by natural selection; in human affairs the primary method of error elimination can be the process of critical discussion. Munz points out that  &quot;mistakes&quot; of a certain kind are necessary for biological evolution.  These are the mutations that provide variations (new cards) beyond the range provided by the recombination of genes  (shuffling the deck).  Most of these &quot;mistakes&quot; are not helpful for the organism but some are advantageous.  Desirable  &quot;mistakes&quot; are thus analogous to the successful products of inventors, scientists and artists.  We need these mistakes because if all sociocultural objects, ideas, rituals, procedures and traditions were reproduced faultlessly, the system would be closed, with no variation, no novelty and no possibility for change and progress.<br />Munz contends that a healthy culture will encourage experimentation and exploration at the risk of many false starts and dead ends.  At the same time high standards of criticism will be maintained, though as Bartley has pointed out, criticism needs to be optimal, not too strict or hasty.  To maintain this precarious balance a theory of criticism is required that focuses on objects or ideas and not on the personality or motives of the artist. In addition, an advance in cultural evolution is also needed permitting people to communicate with one another despite major and perhaps even fundamental differences in their respective belief systems.  For most of recorded history, Munz suggests the basis of social and cultural bonding has been shared belief systems that are exempt from criticism. &quot;Where knowledge is used a social bond, people cannot afford the luxury of exposing it to criticism, lest their co-operation be endangered or cease&quot;.<br />But now, in certain places, a threshold has been crossed: some people; &quot;...have managed to establish societies which are not dependent on the purity of any given cultural strain and which are  bonded by  criteria  other than the adherence to any  particular  beliefsystem and its rituals.&quot;<br />The essential feature of such a society is that some aspects of its evolution can be regulated by critical discussion in a way that was previously not possible. However if this does not happen there may instead be further fragmentation, with the proliferation of self-contained and exclusive sub-cultures. To a very large extent this has happened in academic life and even within disciplines such as philosophy which have fragmented into communities which ignore each other's work.<br />Munz sees the tendency towards closed systems as a counterpart to sociological theories of knowledge whose defence of relativism expresses frustration with the failure of positivism and  &quot;mirror&quot; theories of knowledge (as Munz calls them.)  Mirror theories portray the mind as an inert vessel, or perhaps an induction machine, which accumulates knowledge as a result of passive exposure to the outside world.  The extreme form of the mirror theory occurs in Wittgenstein's Tractatus with its &quot;picture&quot; theory of language in which all valid, meaningful and justified sentences mirror some extra-linguistic fact.<br />The classical alternative to the mirror theory of knowledge is the &quot;lamp&quot; theory, that the outside world is endowed with qualities projected upon it by the linguistic framework of the observer.  This is essentially the view of Kuhn and Rorty, but Munz argues that both the mirror and lamp theories of knowledge contain the same structural error, namely the assumption that some authority is required to provide a grounding for indubitably justified beliefs. Munz wrote \\"After establishing that knowledge cannot be a relationship because it is not like `mirroring', Rorty argues that it must be justified by something else.  For Rorty, knowledge is not knowledge unless it is justified...  In Rorty's view, the great divide in philosophy is between the upholders of mirror philosophy and the believers in the authority of speech communities.  As against this, I would argue that the great divide is between justificationists of all persuasions and Popperians, who believe that we can have knowledge but that no knowledge can ever be justified.\\"<br />Evolutionary epistemology, Munz contends, provides a way out of the impasse created by true belief theories of knowledge, whether of the mirror or lamp variety.  Instead of falling back on justification, he advocates the employment of criticism leading to selection and tentative critical preference.  But any shift from traditional theories of knowledge to an evolutionary epistemology requires theories of criticism to replace theories of justification. This Popper's decisive break with the philosophical mainstream.belief system and its rituals.&quot;<br />The essential feature of such a society is that some aspects of its evolution can be regulated by critical discussion in a way that was previously not possible. However if this does not happen there may instead be further fragmentation, with the proliferation of self-contained and exclusive sub-cultures.

This is essentially the view of Kuhn and Rorty, but Munz argues that both the mirror and lamp theories of knowledge contain the same structural error, namely the assumption that some authority is required to provide a grounding for indubitably justified beliefs. Munz wrote \\"After establishing that knowledge cannot be a relationship because it is not like `mirroring', Rorty argues that it must be justified by something else.  For Rorty, knowledge is not knowledge unless it is justified...  In Rorty's view, the great divide in philosophy is between the upholders of mirror philosophy and the believers in the authority of speech communities.  As against this, I would argue that the great divide is between justificationists of all persuasions and Popperians, who believe that we can have knowledge but that no knowledge can ever be justified.\\"<br />Evolutionary epistemology, Munz contends, provides a way out of the impasse created by true belief theories of knowledge, whether of the mirror or lamp variety.  Instead of falling back on justification, he advocates the employment of criticism leading to selection and tentative critical preference.  But any shift from traditional theories of knowledge to an evolutionary epistemology requires theories of criticism to replace theories of justification. This Popper's decisive break with the philosophical mainstream.	2002-03-04

One of these is the robust statement of his major thesis on the compatibility of free markets, liberty and welfare. The other is the way he uses the non-authoritarian theory of rationality expounded by Karl Popper and William W Bartley.<br />&quot;In practice (rather than in imaginary cases) and in the long term, there are no systematic clashes among interpersonal liberty, general welfare, and market anarchy, where these terms are to be understood roughly as follows...\\". Those who seek linguistic precision may be alarmed that his terms are to be understood roughly.  Lester has quite deliberately avoided the kind of conceptual analysis, the teasing out of the meaning of terms, that Popper has labeled &quot;essentialism&quot;. At least one reviewer noted  the remarkable amount of meat that is packed into the book. This is partly due to the self-conscious avoidance of essentialism, partly to Lester's firm grasp on his materials and party to the mode of argumentation that he has adopted, following the non-justificationist or non-foundational line that has been articulated by Popper and Bartley.<br />The main characteristic of this approach is that it only attempts to achieve what is possible, which is the formation of a critical preference for one option rather than another, in the light of the evidence and arguments that are available up to date. He does not attempt the impossible, namely a logically conclusive proof of his case. What is possible is to propose a theory or a doctrine and subject it to criticism, then if it stands up we may proceed with that theory or doctrine until such time as an alternative is proposed that has better credentials and stands up to criticism at least as well as the previous candidate.<br />Turning to the organization of the book, after the Introduction are four chapters; Rationality, Liberty, Welfare and Anarchy. Each chapter is tightly organised and packed with crisply presented arguments which resist efforts to paraphrase them. Consequently no short review will do justice to the contents of the book or its organisation. Lester's theory of rationality has to reconcile two extreme views in economics - the neglected subjective, \\"a priori\\" approach of Menger and the Austrians, and the standard objective, empirical account. He adopts the theory that agents are self-interested utility-maximisers and he addresses a number of standard objections that are raised against this concept. He argues, successfully in my view, that the objections do no damage to his thesis.<br />Liberty is formulated as the absence of initiated or proactively imposed cost, or in the case of a mutual clash of imposed costs, the minimisation of imposed costs. This means avoiding or minimising the subjective costs imposed on us by other people, without our consent. Lester explains this formulation, compares it with typical libertarian alternatives to illustrate its strengths and then tests it by attempting to solve some problems presented to libertarians by David Friedman and John Gray. This is the longest chapter and it covers a huge amount of ground, including intellectual property rights and a theory of restitution for crimes and torts. In addition to the criticism of Friedman and Gray there is also a rejoinder to Amartya Sen and to Karl Popper.<br />The criticism of John Gray is important because for some time he enjoyed a high profile as a rare instance of a classical liberal Oxford don. Lester also responds to Gray's charge of &quot;restrictivism&quot;, directed at liberals on the ground that they do not accept that freedom is &quot;an essentially contested concept&quot;. In response, Lester accuses Gray of &quot;conflationism&quot;, that is, importing a raft of contentious theories from elsewhere (psychology, hermeneutics, epistemology) to muddle and confuse the issues, at the same time appealing to various authorities and ultimately overriding interpersonal liberty in favour of some other goal.<br />Welfare is a sticking point for many people of good will who support freedom but believe that they cannot be libertarians because of all the poor people who need assistance. Actually support for deserving poor people could be provided by a VWA (Voluntary Welfare Association), dispensing funds from voluntary donations from all the people who currently vote to support welfare policies. The main targets in the chapter on welfare are R M Hare, Amartya Sen, Bernard Williams, John Rawls, John Harsanyi and Alan Ryan.<br />The final chapter on anarchy is very short because most of the work to defend private property and the market order has been done in previous chapters. &quot;Basic conceptual confusion and mere prejudice are more the real problems&quot; (page 193). He casts a critical eye over some conceptual aspects of the state and then he turns to John Rawls again as an exemplar of confusion and prejudice. Finally, Lester identifies the way that Rawls has simply ignored the libertarian position on the state, which is perceived as providing the arena where the most divisive issues can be removed from the political agenda.erriding interpersonal liberty in favour of some other goal. <br />Welfare is a sticking point for many people of good will who support freedom but believe that they cannot be libertarians because of all the poor people who need assistance.

Serious students should return to it every few years along with George Orwell's essay on politics and the English language and C Wright Mills' appendix on intellectual craftsmanship in \\"The Sociological Imagination\\".<br /><br />Barzun approached his special field of cultural history in a refreshingly irreverent manner. \\"You may like to think of culture - I often do - as an enormous pumpkin, hard to penetrate, full of uncharted hollows and recesses for cultural critics to get lost in, and stuffed with seeds of uncertain contents and destiny.\\"<br />Early in his career he produced a connected series of books, starting with 'The French Race\\" (1932) and 'Race: A Study in Superstition\\" (1937 and 1965), moving on to \\"Darwin, Marx, Wagner\\" (1941) and \\"Romanticism and the Modern Ego\\" (1943). The major themes that connect these studies are (a) the appeal to race, class or nation to supply a new motive power for social change and (b) the an attempt to inject new life into the idols of Progress and Fatalism.<br />A subsequent theme in his work is the parlous state of learning and especially the widespread lack of understanding of the \\"house rules\\" for productive intellectual activity. The relevant books here are \\"The House of Intellect\\" (1959),  \\"Science: The Glorious Entertainment\\"(1964) and \\"The American University\\" (1968).<br />The message of \\"The House of Intellect\\" is that its inhabitants, the intellectuals themselves, have trashed the house. The blame cannot be placed with the crassness or greed of big business, the shallowness of a consumer society, or the ignorance of the uneducated. The major malign influences are distorted perceptions of the nature and function of Art, Science and Philanthropy. These things have their value and their place, but Barzun shows how they have become diverted from their proper ends to impose in a destructive manner upon the conditions of scholarship and the life of the mind.<br />His comments on art later grew into a whole volume, \\"The Uses and Abuses of Art\\" and his views on the uses and abuses of science expanded into a whole book as well. The spirit of Philanthropy is expressed though the well-meant allocations of funds from the great foundations. However Barzun details how the net effect of this funding, especially that provided for conferences, is to dissipate rather than to concentrate thought, to take up time and effort on apparent novelties at the expense of solid and genuine but not superficially exciting or \\"relevant\\" work. A whole \\"grant application\\" industry emerged, engaging time and talents for trivial purposes, often enough dedicated to outright hokum, to the detriment of the proper function of intellectuals and intellect.<br />This book has \\"white dwarf\\" status because there is more in it each time it is re-read.

As a result of this process the term liberalism has ceased to mean anything unless it is qualified in some way.<br />All of the contributors have something valuable to offer, especially Keith Windshuttle and Robert Conquest. Windschuttle has studied the waxing and waning fortunes of British liberalism, especially in relation to imperialism and the Empire. Adam Smith and David Hume saw no future for overseas dominions other than as friendly trading partners and similar views were held by the 19th century Manchester radicals such as Cobden and Bright. However one evil led to another because the threat of Napoleon prompted Britain to establish a worldwide system of naval bases to protect their sea trade and later these became the entry points for colonization of the pink coloured empire that extended around the globe. The philosophical counterpart of this movement was the philosophy of T H Green and the later Mill. The new nationalism and jingoism of the late 19th century resulted in some of the most squalid episodes in British history, of which the worst was probably the Boer War.<br />Robert Conquest's essay examines the record and credibility of the fellow-travelers with communism. During the Cold War Arthur Koestler speculated that the future of civilization might depend on the outcome of the struggle between communists and ex-communists because only ex-communists could comprehend how the cause could capture the loyalties of some of the best of men and also the worst of men. The best had to undergo crises of conscience when the reality could not be avoided. Little Louie, the fictional communist dockworker in Darkness at Noon committed suicide but more sophisticated western fellow travelers generally lack his integrity.<br />The collection has strengths and weaknesses. First the positives.For a long time it has been apparent that true liberalism could win any number of battles on economic policy but still lose the war through being outflanked on the cultural front. It often seems that true liberals of the libertarian kind have not been very active on this front or even aware of the issues at stake. Conservatives tend to be more alert to the dangers in this area and more active in responding to them, as the contributors to this collection have done.<br />Some market liberals may need to be reminded that we do not live by bread and technology alone. Our lives gain meaning and purpose from the myths and traditions which constitute our non-material heritage. At a lower but no less important level our daily transactions are dignified and lubricated by civility and good manners. Both the higher and lower orders of this fragile structure of civilisation are perpetuated by<br />cultural practices and by institutions such as the family and the universities. Many of these freedom-enhancing and life-enriching traditions, like the private domain itself, are under threat from various doctrines of the debased kind of liberalism that is targeted in this collection of essays. Many schools of thought which run counter to true liberalism are part of intellectual heritage. For this reason, if we lose the capacity to subject our tradition heritage to imaginative criticism, we run the risk that the good tendencies will be driven out by the bad. Some would say that this process is well advanced.<br />On the negative side, those contributors to this book who take up philosophical issues have hardly drawn upon the two most powerful liberal philosophers of our time, namely Hayek and Popper. There are some fleeting references to Hayek but none at all to Popper. This is rather like going into a big ball game with your two strongest players on the bench. Some of the contributors (Scruton, Kimball and Windschuttle) would probably not even want Popper on the squad,<br />judging from their comments on his work in other places.<br />The economic agenda of liberalism was not under the spotlight in this collection, still it was disconcerting to find that John Silber comes across as an unreconstructed New Dealer. Hadley Arkes, writing on \\"Liberalism and the Law\\" deplored the equivocation of Justice Harlan faced with a youth in his courthouse wearing a coat emblazoned with \\"Fxxxx the Draft\\". No doubt this was an obscene act but the conscription of young man for Vietnam was the great obscenity of the time, not only in its own right but for the way that it resulted in the loss of the war (through loss of support at home) after it had been effectively won on the ground in Vietnam. In the same way that conscription was the great moral mistake of the sixties, the War on Drugs threatens to shred the fabric of civil liberties and due process in our time. John O'Sullivan referred to the fall in crime \\"plainly the result of greater use of imprisonment\\" but the fall in crime is much more likely to be result of demographic factors (and possibly abortion law reform two decades ago) while the rise of imprisonment is a result of the War on Drugs. Another factor that undermines respect for even-handed justice and promotes racial tension is the racism of aggressive affirmative action programs such as college set asides and quotas for hiring.<br />Hayek pointed out that there are tensions between conservatives and Old Whigs, even while we form common cause against radicals and modern liberals (someone wrote \\"I vote libertarian if I can, otherwise I hold my nose and vote Republican\\"). These tensions<br />need to be explored so that economic liberals become more attuned to the culture war and conservatives become more sensitive to the erosion of freedoms by the State when it attempts to act as a custodian of morals.would probably not even want Popper on the squad,<BR>judging from their comments on his work in other places. <br />The economic agenda of liberalism was not under the spotlight in this collection, still it was disconcerting to find that John Silber comes across as an unreconstructed New Dealer.

Popper is identified as the pivotal figure between the old positivism and the new heterodoxy of  Kuhn, Lakatos and Feyerabend. Unfortunately he is still depicted as a \\"falsificationist\\" rather than a critical rationalist, a serious mistake in the first edition which might well have been corrected. Hands and Caldwell have subsequently made that step so perhaps Blaug will fix this in the second revised edition. Lakatos may have been the major influence in this matter of misunderstanding Popper, in any case the time has surely come to move on with the assistance of  Popper's theory of metaphysical research programs (which are subjected to critical appraisal) rather than the theory of \\"untouchable\\" hard cores that was the legacy of  Lakatos.<br />Blaug may be ready to make a decisive step in this area. Recently, meditating on the outcome of the second Greek Islands conference on methodology, he wrote \\"I have come slowly and extremely reluctantly to the view that they [the Austrians] are right and that we have all been wrong [on Walrasian general equilibrium]\\". This concession to the Austrians is a major shift for Blaug and this may enable him to take the next step and perceive the overlap between the Austrian assumptions and the major elements of Popper's program. There include realism, non-determinism, the flux of time, methodological individualism and the uncertainty of knowledge<br />The second part treats the history of economic methodology. This provides an opportunity to rubbish the modern Austrians for their a priori heuristic postulates (this is the old, or rather the younger, Blaug  speaking). There is a chapter on falsificationism, and various other \\"isms\\" including operationalism, Friedman's instrumentalism and Samuelson's descriptivism. Unfortunately the treatment of instrumentalism and descriptivism (or conventionalism) falls far short of that which is offered in Boland's The Foundations of Economic Method (1982)<br />The heart and soul of the book should be the third part which is a methodological appraisal of various aspects of the neoclassical research program.  As C Wright Mills pointed out, discussion of methodology in isolation from actual work in progress is unlikely to be fruitful, so this part of the book should stand as a test (a possible falsification) of the value of Blaug's methodological apparatus. It might have been even more helpful to include two of his own special areas of interest - education and the arts, in this section, but perhaps this work is not a part of the neoclassical research program.<br />The fourth part is a short commentary on what we have now learned about economics with advice on falsificationism, applied econometrics and the best way forward.cluding operationalism, Friedman's instrumentalism and Samuelson's descriptivism.

Pluto's Republic contains the essays in two previous collections, The Art of the Soluble and The Hope of Progress, both currently out of print.  It also contains essays on induction and intuition in scientific thought, several pieces not previously collected in book form and some new items. The contents range far and wide, including some vigorous polemics with Arthur Koestler following Medawar's review of The Act of Creation, comments on some recent books on the state of the art in cancer research and an essay on 'type A' behaviour and heart disease.<br />Medawar has forthright views on the use of technology to improve the world. He also considers that the traditional division of &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;applied&quot; science is unhelpful, probably deriving from the same perverse cast of mind that created the &quot;romantic versus rational&quot; dichotomy between imaginative and critical thinking, allied with the old Anglo-Saxon class distinction between science (for amateur &quot;gentlemen&quot;) and technology (for grubby professional &quot;players&quot;). The traditional view, preserved jealously by pure scientists, is that researchers of high caliber should be allowed to follow their interests wherever they will, either in the belief that this is what the universities and the life of the mind are all about, or in the confident expectation that eventually fundamental work will pay off at the practical level.  Medawar concedes<br />&quot;This procedure works; that is, it works sometimes, and it may be the best we can do, but might not the converse approach be equally effective, given equal talent? That is, to start with a concrete problem, but then to allow the research to open out in the direction of greater generality...I can see no reason why this approach if it were to be attempted by persons of the same ability, should not work just as well as its more conventional counterpart. Research done in this style is always in focus, and those who carry it out, if temporarily baffled, can always retreat from the general into the particular.&quot;<br />It is increasingly accepted that science should have some strategic role to play in education but misconceived ideas about science have made it hard to work out what that role might be. A vacuum is waiting to be filled in the theory and practice of education, and Medawar's book should help to fill it. The &quot;piling up the data&quot; theory has to be put in its place (the dust-bin of history) because it promotes over specialisation, as though the person who spends the most time digging the most narrow trench will get further in the field. At the same time outsiders are discouraged from trying to find out what the scientists are up to, for how can they ever find the time to get into the trenches and master the accumulated store of information?<br />The alternative &quot;hot air balloon&quot; view of science may be more helpful and realistic. Rival theories do not depend on the sheer weight of evidence (most of the evidence can be used to support opposing theories), nor do they gain credibility by longevity alone. They need to compete for survival under critical scrutiny and tests. Five types of test can be applied: the test of evidence, the test of internal consistency, the test of consistency with other well-tested theories, the check on the problem  (does the theory actually solve the problem, or just skirt around it) and the check of metaphysics (the least understood at this stage).  With this view of knowledge people like Leonard Woolf could claim that he could become an expert in any field with three months of concentrated study (between running the Hogarth Press, writing Fabian tracts and socialising in Bloomsbury). More realistically we might follow the advice of Jacques Barzun in The House of Intellect<br />With a cautious confidence and sufficient intellectual training, it is possible to master the literature of a subject and gain a proper understanding of it: specifically, an understanding of the accepted truths, the disputed problems, the rival schools and the methods now in favor. This will not enable one to add to what is known, but it will give possession of all that the discipline has to offer the world.<br />There is much talk of the modern explosion of knowledge. This is mostly an explosion of publications, some of which advance our knowledge but only by a very small amount. Many do not even do as much as that. The existence of high quality science reporting in popular magazines (New Scientist etc) nullifies the despairing belief that the frontiers of science are receding ever further from view. These publications make Barzun's aim (if not Woolf's) entirely feasible for anyone who wants to keep informed of the main lines of scientific advance; to keep track of the balloons which float in the air, tugging at their mooring lines, while on board the balloons the infernal Popperian dialectic of conjecture and refutation rages, day and night.nfidence and sufficient intellectual training, it is possible to master the literature of a subject and gain a proper understanding of it: specifically, an understanding of the accepted truths, the disputed problems, the rival schools and the methods now in favor.

Not all were idle, some were interesting eccentrics and others were able to follow their own interests and speak their minds without fear of their jobs or their livelihood. Magee managed to emulate this way of life to some extent because he was able to move in and out of well-paid work and maintain a high degree of independence in his thinking and his writing. True independence of thought is almost completely unknown these days, due to political pressures and to the demands for conformity for progress in a career.<br />The main theme of the book is Magee's dissatisfaction with the mainstream of analytical philosophy, and his quest for a philosophy that has something to say about the big questions that philosophy and science do not attempt to answer. A subtext to the main theme is Magee's progress through life as a writer, politician, social commentator and broadcaster. Here we encounter his political career, his novels, his crisis of identity and his lengthy quest for enlightenment which led him to the works of Schopenhauer.<br />Magee read history and philosophy at Oxford and Yale (a breath of fresh air), then in 1956 he moved to London and found his way into radio and TV. Blessed with a flair for research and presentation he rose to anchor the leading British weekly current affairs program on TV. This advanced his political education in a very interesting way because he traveled all over the world and discovered the reality of life under communist and socialist regimes.  To his dismay, back home even his conservative friends could not credit the full extent of the brutality and squalor that he encountered under the Marxist regimes of the world.<br />Magee became friends with Karl Popper and Bertrand Russell, the two men who he regarded as the most important living philosophers at that time. His friendship with Popper was stormy because he was prepared to stand toe to toe and argue despite Popper's overbearing manner. Still, he considered that Popper's contribution was invaluable and has yet to be fully appreciated, especially by professional philosophers.<br />Magee had a short but rewarding friendship with Bertrand Russell until the old man was cut off from the world by his private secretary. Magee visited Russell in Wales to discuss an appearance on a TV current affairs program. Russell (aged 87) waited hand and foot on the young reporter (to Magee's intense discomfort) and the visit continued into the evening when Russell discovered Magee's interest in politics and philosophy. Due to Russell's great age and his elevated station both in society and in the realm of intellect it seemed to Magee that most of the history of the last 85 years had passed through his life. When Magee made a critical comment on some aspect of Marxism, Russell replied \\"Yes, I made exactly that point to Lenin, but I couldn't get him to see it\\".<br />For some people the most interesting aspect of this book will be the insights and perspectives that Magee provides on modern philosophy, especially in Britain. The major defect of the system was the tendency for philosophers to be recruited from students of Greats - that is, Greek, Latin and Ancient History. They knew nothing of science and in many cases were actively hostile to it. There was probably a class bias as well, and a tendency to live their lives apart from the wider world of commerce and politics.  In addition to the deficiencies of the recruits, both phases of Wittgenstein's influence tended to work against imaginative and original thinking.<br />He pioneered serious intellectual discussion on air, first with a BBC radio series on modern British philosophers, later with a program called Something to Say in which He chaired one-hour debates between high-powered opponents: Aron and Marcuse; Hayek and Bernard Crick; Galbraith versus Crossland (on the  need for economic growth); Monod versus Eccles (on the human soul); Ayer versus a Roman Catholic bishop (on the existence of God).<br />To make these dialogues work for the popular audience Magee had to prepare in depth.  Some of this preparation brought him into contact with a body of ideas that had been quite foreign to him. His own political position was quite clear, as a prospective Labour candidate he defined himself as a non-Marxist, non-socialist but heavily interventionist liberal. He felt he had all the answers to the left-wing radicals and the mainstream of conservatives (Conservative Party voters).<br />He wrote \\"But now, for the first time in my life, I came seriously up against a fourth position, the position of the radical right, whose existence I had known of before but which I had never regarded with respect.

For others history merely consists of one damn thing after another. Robert Stafford appears to lean towards the second view and fortunately Murchison (1792-1871) was involved in enough important things to make his life story valuable. It would be even more valuable and interesting if the author had deployed a better theory than Gramski's doctrine of hegemony for the final summary. The lack of a robust theoretical framework prevents the book from delivering on the dustjacket promise to illuminate the broader intimacy between science and government.<br />In his youth Murchison might well have been voted the least likely of his contemporaries to succeed in the life of the mind. At school he was a dreadful student and he turned to a military career. This helped to prepared him for his ultimate vocation because at military college he studied topographical appraisal and draughtsmanship, two of the vital skills for geological fieldwork. He served in the Spanish campaign against Napoleon but the end of hostilities in 1815 destroyed his hopes for military glory. Relegated to a backwater in Ireland he diverted himself with riding, hunting, drinking bouts and visits to London where he paraded as a dandy. He also attended lectures by Sir Humphrey Davy at the Royal Institute for Science.<br />This unlikely combination of activities won him the hand in marriage of a cultured lady, Charlotte Hugonin, only daughter of a wealthy general. She encouraged him to develop more refined interests in the course of a prolonged Continental tour. He undertook prodigious walking expeditions and showed a keen eye for country and a willingness to describe it in detail. Back in England he reverted to fox hunting on his country estate until the problem of debt and a partridge shooting expedition with Sir Humphrey Davy inspired him to turn to Science.<br />The couple moved to a rented house in London until the death of Charlotte's father some years later enabled them to occupy a mansion in Belgrave Square. This, at page 15 (circa 1842) is the last mention of wife, family, or social life in the book. The strangest feature of this biography is the complete absence of any sense of the subject as a flesh and blood man (or a person) living a life among people.<br />Fifteen years of intensive fieldwork mapping the Silurian sediments in Wales provided the foundation for his scientific reputation. After his early and important contribution, he did not appear to shift his opinion on any matter of theoretical interest. During that time he established close social and working relationships with all the major geologists in Europe. He also began his pursuit of power and influence in the scientific societies, initially the Geological Society where he became the Foreign Secretary in 1828. For many years he was on the council of the Royal Society, also he was a trustee of the British Museum and an active office bearer in practically any other society or club that could advance his interests. If the suitable organisation did not exists he created it. He was a founding member of the Athanaeum Club, the Royal Geographical Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. These societies played a major role in directing scientific work, at a time when government involvement did not go far beyond naval mapping and some surveying for strategic materials during times of war.<br />The book outlines his tireless efforts through committees, patronage, political connections and publicity to expand and co-ordinate worldwide efforts in exploration and data collection. No continent was untouched by his efforts, and those of his friends and disciples in the field. As a testament to his influence, Australia alone contains five Mount Murchisons and two Murchison Rivers, while New Zealand has four mountains and a glacier named after him.<br />His effortscalled for amazing stamina and organising ability, also the time that was made available by minimal domestic responsibilities and a supportive wife. He was not a radical but his support for free trade and its corollary, peace, put him at odds with the government in some military adventures, notably the Crimean War. He also encouraged the full participation and recognition of women in the scientific societies, generously acknowledging the efforts of Jane Franklin in Tasmania and other female pioneers.ts called for amazing stamina and organising ability, also the time that was made available by minimal domestic responsibilities and a supportive wife.

US	49163407	R14FOE9PVSF3YJ	0029242509	967523390	002: The Structure of Social Action, Vol. 2	Books	5	39	40	N	N	The enduring legacy of Karl Menger	First published in 1937, this book is a remarkable scholarly achievement and it richly deserves the status of a classic. It is not an easy read, partly on account of its genuine depth and partly because Parsons was never content with one word where ten or twelve would do.<br /><br />Parsons offers a voluntarist theory of action described as a synthesis of tendencies in the work of Alfred Marshall, Emile Durkheim and Max Weber. This is actually a development of Karl Menger's approach to social and economic theory, and this work represents a parallel or simultaneous discovery with Ludwig Mises (praxeology) and Karl Popper (situational analysis).<br />Parsons' first task (in the 1930s) was to rehabilitate the role of theory in sociology and human studies. &quot;Returning to this country (USA) I found behaviorism so rampant that anyone who believed in the scientific validity of the interpretation of subjective states of mind was often held to be fatuously naive. Also rampant was what I called 'empiricism', namely the idea that scientific knowledge was a total reflection of the 'reality out there' and even selection was alleged to be illegitimate&quot;.<br />He defended systematic theory against various forms of empiricism which emphasised the accumulation of facts. At the same time he attempted to justify analytical realism against theorists who looked upon theories as merely convenient fictions. Against the empiricists Parsons claimed that there could be no worthwhile fact gathering without some reference to theory, and against the &quot;instrumental&quot; view he maintained that &quot;at least some of the general concepts of science are not fictional but adequately 'grasp' aspects of the objective external world&quot;.<br />So far as substantive theory was concerned, the problem situation which Parsons addressed was the failure of three great systems to provide an adequate general theory of action. A satisfactory theory had to provide a frame of reference to analyse the puzzling co-existence of social order with voluntarism (indeterminism) and it had to provide a frame of reference to analyse the emergence of complex systems whose function could not be reduced to the laws explaining the function of the parts, while explaining the interpenetration which exists between the factors controlling the whole and the factors controlling the parts.<br />The three systems which had failed were (1) utilitarianism and economic theory which involved a rationalistic, individualistic theory of social behaviour; (2) positivism, which involved the reduction of human behaviour to laws of physics and biology; (3) idealism, theories which interpreted social phenomena as emanations from the realm of cultural values.<br />Utilitarian theory could not account for ritualistic activities  and it gave no explanation of social order or the coordination of individual acts into organised social systems.<br />Positivism attempts to overcome the utilitarian dilemma by providing a scientific explanation for the coordination of ends. The explanation of action lies in the conditions of the action objectively rather than subjectively considered, meaning the factors of hereditary and environment. However this approach ignored the emergent properties of complex systems, particularly the ethical elements which Parsons believed are a creative factor in human action.<br />&quot;The orientation of ethics (as opposed to science) is essentially active. Its centre of gravity lies in the creative role of the actor, his ends. Freedom of choice is basic to ethics; whatever determinism is accepted lies in the field of the consequences of having made a given choice&quot;.<br />Idealism presented answers to some of the problems left unsolved by utilitarianism and positivism, introducing the Geist or spirit of the culture to explain human action as an emanation. This solved the problem of order without using physical reduction but it involved reduction of a different kind. As a general theory of action, explanation of human behaviour as a manifestation of the Geist is hardly better than an explanation in terms of physics and biology. What was worse from Parsons' point of view as a systematic theorist was the doctrine that generalisations could not be made about societies or cultures. Every social situation had to be considered in its concrete uniqueness.<br />Parsons followed Weber in his reaction against two idealist doctrines which Parsons calls objectivism and intuitionism. Both schools agree that general laws cannot be used in the human sciences but they disagree as to the reasons.<br />Weber went on to build up a sophisticated methodology including three elements which Parsons adopted. These are:<br />I) general concepts are required in the social sciences as well as in the natural sciences.<br />2) verstehen, the faculty of sympathetic understanding, is required to cope with the subjective aspects of action.<br />3) if action is to be understandable there must be an element of rationality in it. There must be some comprehensible relationship between ends and means.<br />Parsons was not completely satisfied with Weber's methodology because he thought there was even less difference between the natural and social sciences than Weber allowed. Parsons instead proposed to make a distinction between analytical and historical sciences, which cuts across the boundaries usually placed between the natural and social sciences.<br />&quot;Then for the historical sciences theoretical concepts are means to understanding the concrete historical individual. For the analytical sciences, on the other hand, the reverse is true; concrete historical individuals are means, 'cases' in terms of which the validity of the theoretical system may be tested by 'verification&quot;'. For a similar approach see Popper on explanation in science and historical studies (Open Society, Chapter 24).<br />Subsequent work by Parsons was flawed by his idea that mathematics was the language of physics, and sociology similarly needed its own language which he attempted to provide by way of the pattern variable scheme. He also became trapped by the notion of &quot;system&quot; and lost the individualistic element that is essential to the action frame of reference and its parallels in praxeology and situational analysis.neral theory of action, explanation of human behaviour as a manifestation of the Geist is hardly better than an explanation in terms of physics and biology.

The first was to provide  a critique of positivism, including logical positivism, logical empiricism, operationalism and falsificationism.  The second was to identify the implications of this critique for economic methodology.<br />The first part of the book describes the role of the Vienna Circle in the rise of logical positivism during the 1920s and 1930s, followed by the maturation of the tradition in the form of logical empiricism, then the philosophical attack and the emergence of the \\"growth of knowledge\\" tradition with Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos and Feyerabend.<br />The second part of the book consists of essays on various aspects of positivism and alternative approaches including the \\"Austrian\\" approach of Robins and Machlup (each pitted against Hutchison), Friedman's instrumentalism and Samuelson's \\"descriptivism\\".<br />The third part provides some provisional answers, notably a case for methodological pluralism.<br />In view of the way that positivism dominated the philosophy of science during the 20th century this scholarly appraisal of the rise and fall of the movement is a valuable contribution to the history of ideas. However as a contribution to contemporary thinking on these matters it would have been a more original and challenging enterprise if positivism had not already been devastated by Popper, who replaced justificationism and inductivism with critical rationalism and the non-authoritarian theory of knowledge.<br />This is a new edition of Caldwell's 1982 book but it is not really revised and so it does not do justice to his \\"mature\\" thinking which can be found in an article \\"clarifying Popper\\" in the Journal of Economic Literature, March 1991. This article draws on Popper's theory of metaphysical research programs and shows that when he is depicted as a critical rationalist instead of a falsificationist, several pieces of the jigsaw fall into place, including Popper's re-invention of \\"Austrian\\" praxeology and Talcott Parsons' &quot;action frame of reference&quot; under the heading of  \\"situational analysis\\".<br />It seems that the field of economic methodology has been unduly influenced by Mark \\"Bluster\\" Blaug's commitment to Lakatos rather than Popper, to \\"falsificationism\\" rather than critical rationalism and to the Kuhn/Lakatos notion of research programs with inviolable \\"hard cores\\" rather than the Popperian program which subjects \\"hard cores\\" to critical appraisal. Lakatos, as a Hegelian, attempted a synthesis of Popper and Kuhn, to capture the Spirit of the Age, as it was, becoming in the process a Historical Figure. This grand scheme did not work out and the tormented progress of the Lakatosian World Spirit continued to cause confusion on several continents (and in the isles of Greece) even after Lakatos himself had gone.<br />When the idea of Popper as a critical rationalist is taken on board, as Caldwell appeared to be doing in his \\"clarification\\" paper, then some really interesting results emerge, as indicated by Boland in 1982. It may be that the real impediment to progress in economics is not the failure to be serious about falsification (as Blaug has argued) but the failure to recognize that the real driving forces in methodology are Instrumentalism (as per Friedman) and Conventionalism (as per Samuelson). These need to be subjected to critical appraisal, in the context of ongoing research, not merely as a part of the history of ideas.<br />In this book Caldwell has shown a remarkable open-mindedness to the much-maligned ideas of the Austrians. This would have taken a deal of nerve in view of the hard things that are said about them by his peers and by luminaries such as Samuelson. (There again, it was Samuelson who, up to the Fall of the Wall, thought that the Soviet economy was doing well and catching up fast with the US).  Similarly, it was bold to champion Popper's ideas on the metaphysical aspects of scientific research programs. This is exciting stuff and one hopes that Caldwell is prepared to continue the maturation process that was apparent in his article, even to the extent of producing a seriously revised edition of this book.exciting stuff and one hopes that Caldwell is prepared to continue the maturation process that was apparent in his article, even to the extent of producing a seriously revised edition of this book.	2002-02-21

It has some value as a comprehensive survey of thought on the topic of methodology in economics and it signals that when Popper is understood as a critical rationalist instead of a falsificationist then he makes a lot of sense. Larry Boland has been saying that for 20 years and he should have got more credit from Hands.<br /><br />The book has three goals. First, to provide a survey of recent developments in the field of economic methodology. Second, to survey contemporary science theory as it relates to economics. The third &quot;is to convince the reader that we should change the subject&quot;. He suggests that we should abandon the 'off the rack' or 'shelf of scientific philosophy' approach to the philosophy of science. This approach consists of trying to find out what economics should be doing to qualify as a proper science. His alternative is to encourage people to think the issues through afresh, to explore the full range of approaches that are available to economists in place of the traditional, largely positivist/empiricist philosophy of science.<br /><br />Methodology has never had much of a profile among working economists and it had to make its way by attaching itself to the history of ideas in economics which at least had some academic credibility in the form of journals and conferences. However this meant that both the historians and the methodologists occupied a kind of outhouse behind the place where all the real economists lived.<br /><br />The overwhelming defect in the book is the way that Hands describes the Received View in the philosophy of science as a mixture of logical positivism and falsification interpreted in a positivistic way. Popper is unfortunately misrepresented as an eccentric contributor to the Received View, largely under the influence of Lakatos and his followers, especially Latsis and Blaug. Under the influence of this misrepresentation of Popper's though, a generation of scholars  have wasted much of their careers, playing  in a kind of intellectual sandpit, off to the side of economics and philosophy, without making a significant contribution to either.<br />The weakness of the Hands book is demonstrated by the neglect of Boland and Wong. The latter is mentioned twice, in passing, without any hint of the way that he shredded the program that won Samuelson a Nobel Prize for his contribution to methodology in economics. Boland is noted as a man who always resisted the &quot;falsificationist&quot; interpretation of Popper and his books are cited without any hint of the riches to be found in them. This contrasts with the whole chapter on &quot;The Sociological Turn&quot; and hundreds of pages devoted to other dead-ends like feminist methodology.<br />The best part of the book is where the author depicts Popper as a critical rationalist and shows how this makes sense of Popper's hitherto rather confused exposition of situational analysis and the rationality principle. Given this grasp of Popper (provided by Boland in his first book in 1982) Hands should have junked all the previous pages of criticism of  Popper's non-existent \\"falsificationism\\".<br />Unfortunately, despite the wide scope of the material covered in this book, the Austrian school of economic thought does not get a decent mention. Caldwell did rather better on this in \\"Beyond Positivism\\". It is quite likely that when Popper is fully understood as a critical rationalist, and when his theory of research programs is also understood, then a highly synergetic combination of Popper and the Austrians may be possible. That man Boland (again) was just about there with his Popper/Hayek model in 1982.<br />In conclusion, if Hands can fully consolidate his new understanding of Popper (instead of making out that this is a development in Popper's thought rather than his own) then his next book should be shorter and much more helpful. One more thing, it is imperative that work on methodology should be conducted in close contact with work in progress on theories and real-world problems. As C Wright Mills wrote in the superb appendix to \\"The Sociological Imagination\\" on intellectual craftsmanship, there must be interludes of discussion of problems, theories and methods, not just one or other of the three. Otherwise the economics profession will never take notice of the mutterings in the outhouse.d in close contact with work in progress on theories and real-world problems.

Alan Chalmers wrote this book (first published in 1976) because there was no suitable introductory text for undergraduate studies in the history and philosophy of science. The preliminary chapters are devoted to a close scrutiny and demolition of the old orthodoxy in the pre-Popperian philosophy of science, an orthodoxy still nurtured by admirers of the late David Stove.  Anything Goes by David Stove is supposed to be a weapon in the battle against the barbarians of deconstructionism but if Chalmers and Popper are on the right track, then turning to Stove and the inductivists for help is like fighting fire with petrol. It can be argued that the long domination of the logical positivists in the philosophy of science created such a mess (and a boring mess to boot) that many students were driven into the sociology of science or to the more radical camp of the deconstructionists.<br />Chalmers notes the common belief that the authority of science depends on the way that it \\"is derived from the facts\\".  However, as many research students discover when they turn from the bench to start writing up their results, it is very misleading to hope that accumulated observations will turn into general principles or theories (or a thesis). Still, scientific theories are supposed to be based on facts and confirmed by facts, and for a long time the official scientific method was an alleged process of induction, whereby scientific knowledge starts with the unbiased observation of the regularities which exist in the world around us and is finally warranted or verified by inductive proof. Chalmers explains with meticulous care how and why inductive verification and warranting does not work. Moreover he explains that it is not necessary to account for the growth or rationality of scientific knowledge.<br />One of the problems with the observational origin of theories is the abstract nature of advanced scientific theories. Electrons, wave currents and force fields are simply not accessible to observation, nor are the principles of natural selection or the laws of supply and demand. Equally embarrassing is the logical problem of induction. However many black ravens you observe, there is no way to prove that all ravens (in the universe) are black.<br />Popper's contribution to advance the debate was a revamped version of the hypothetico-deductive method foreshadowed by Jevons, Whewell, Pierce and the French physiologist Bernard.  He argued that knowledge advances by a problem-oriented process of conjecture, followed by rigorous testing of tentative solutions. Then we may select the best among the competing theories by its ability to survive the process of testing, or for its convenience if it is to be used for engineering calculations, or for its fertility if it is to used to inspire further research.  Falsified theories need not be discarded because they may stage a revival, they may have instrumental value and they may persist as components of a larger structure.<br />Popper's ideas were unfortunately labeled \\"falsificationism\\" because they were  advanced in the 1930s as a rejoinder to the logical positivists who wanted to use factual verification as a criterion of meaning. The \\"falsificationism\\" label was unfortunate and very misleading. As Popper recognized, there are problems with experimental or observational testing which preclude logically decisive falsifications. When other people noticed these problems, they claimed that this \\"falsified\\" Popper's theory of knowledge and scientific method.  This is not the case, because Popper's theory is more appropriately called \\"the non-authoritarian theory of knowledge\\" (because there is no ultimate authority) or \\"conjectural objective knowledge\\" (in contrast with the traditional quest for justified beliefs). But still, the impossibility of obtaining decisive falsifications was used by critics as the rationale to prematurely eliminate Popper from the main game in the 1970s.  This was partly due to the raging success of Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions which captured the sociological spirit of the age with a beguiling account of the diffusion of intellectual innovations in the scientific community.<br />One of the most valuable sections of this book is the scrutiny of Kuhn and here Chalmers identifies profound ambiguity. Kuhn insists that there is evolutionary progress in science, on the other it is hard to reconcile this view with the `gestalt switching' process that is supposed to occur as people move from one paradigm to the next. Chalmers points out that the \\"gestalt switching' and the notion of incommensurability of paradigms can be put aside if one makes some fairly uncontroversial assumptions about the objectivity of scientific theories. In a previous publication, Science and its Fabrication, Chalmers has argued in a similar vein against the strong proponents of the sociology of science.<br />Turning to Lakatos, with his notion of a \\"hard core\\" of a research program which has to be protected from falsification by deflecting criticism to other \\"non core\\" elements of the program, Chalmers finds that there is no satisfactory guide to the selection of theories to be protected from the rigors of criticism. The radical views of Feyerabend are carefully dissected and Chalmers concedes that there are probably no universal and timeless standards in the philosophy of science. However this is not a concession that \\"anything goes\\" because it simply mirrors the situation in science itself.<br />This book can be recommended for anyone who wants to obtain a firmer grasp of science and its rationale. The  writing style is clear, engaging and unpretentious. The book is packed with episodes from the history of science so that there is a great deal to be learned about science itself in addition to the philosophical lessons that Chalmers has to convey. The major deficiency in the book is the inadequate characterization of Popper as a \\"falsificationist\\" and the neglect of Popper's theory of metaphysical research programs which appeared in the third volume of his \\"Postscript to the Logic of Scientific Discovery\\" in 1982.raging success of Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions which captured the sociological spirit of the age with a beguiling account of the diffusion of intellectual innovations in the scientific community. <br />One of the most valuable sections of this book is the scrutiny of Kuhn and here Chalmers identifies profound ambiguity.

The immediate focus is upon the activities of scientists at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne in order to explore the way that these activities are shaped by social, political, financial and intellectual influences.<br />Part One, 'The life-world of the Institute', sketches the recent history of ideas in immunology, the field where the Institute gained world renown when its Director, Macfarlane Burnet, shared a Nobel Prize with Sir Peter Medawar. Part Four is written in the same descriptive vein with a broader geographical scope, detailing  some of the intellectual and political elements of the worldwide quest to find a vaccine for malaria. Part Two, 'The subjective side of science' includes a chapter on 'The myth of objectivity' which lays the foundation for the major purpose of the whole work - to challenge received views on the philosophy and methodology of science. Part Three, 'The mode of scientific production' closely examines the way that scientists approach their daily tasks, with the central image being the laboratory as a factory to produce data.<br />The book operates at several levels, from high journalism and science criticism to the ecology of excellence and the philosophy and methodology of science. As a piece of high quality reporting it is impressive in its scope and depth, though a hostile insider (Leon Wolpert) described it as 'mere' journalism.  This unfair because the writers achieve a standard of science writing that will provide a challenge to all comers.<br />The major and overwhelming defect of the book is the failure to engage, or even mention, the most robust and fruitful body of ideas in the field. This is a striking example of the phenomenon they describe as 'socially structured forgetting' or 'structural amnesia' (p 101). They have neatly excised Karl Popper's theory of conjecture and refutation from their account of the philosophy and methods of science. But Popper's work surely represents either the orthodox view of scientific method (as accepted by a number of eminent scientists who took their philosophy seriously such as Medawar, Eccles, Monod and Einstein), or a formidable rival to the traditional form of Baconian induction, still championed by David Stove.<br />An amazing revelation appeared recently when the senior author wrote a review of the reissue of David Stove's critique of Popper and others. He reported that Popper was the only philosopher of science who was held in any regard by the members of the Institute. This evidence would have refuted their major, though unstated, thesis, that Popper does not count in the real world of science.  Apparently that particular evidence was regarded as superfluous when it came to writing up the research. Of course scientists discard data when they think that the experimental apparatus was malfunctioning. In this case it appears that was the scientists were considered to be malfunctioning!<br />Life Among the Scientists is located in the tradition of the 'social construction of science', a form of thought that thrives in the intellectual wasteland created by the popular reception of T. S. Kuhn's work on the diffusion of scientific innovations. To their credit the authors fall short of the strong form of relativism that is common in this tradition and this may indicate that their interest in science is strong enough to resist the debilitating effect of their theoretical framework. The popularity of the 'social construction' view and its serious limitations raise two questions. What is going on in academic departments of philosophy and the social sciences to account for their structural amnesia regarding Popper? And is there any way that philosophers or other metascientists can provide assistance to scientists?<br />The answer to the first question awaits further anthropological studies, though Bartley throws out some clues in his contribution to In Pursuit of Truth (ed P. Levinson, Humanities Press, 1982).  As to the second question, philosophers may have nothing to offer at the tactical level of science where the major requirements are better data and new or revised descriptive theories. However there are times when progress is blocked by problems at a higher (or deeper) strategic level and attention needs to be paid to the unstated assumptions and metaphors that guide the formulation of problems and determine the kind of solutions that are sought. For example the immune reaction by the body to foreign matter was supposed to involve a mechanism of instruction from the invaders to the immune system to produce the appropriate antibodies. Burnet followed a hint from Jerne to demonstrate that the mechanism at work is one of selection among a range of responses generated initially by the immune system. A similar shift of focus, from a mechanism of instruction acting on an essentially passive or reactive organism, to one of selection among trials generated by the organism, has important implications in epistemology and evolutionary theory. Popper has drawn out some of these in his critique of inductive and Lamarckian thinking in his intellectual autobiography, Unended Quest.<br />In conclusion, Life Among the Scientists succeeds in some of its objectives despite the problems at its conceptual heart. It is a good read for the most part provided that one is not distracted by the potentially irritating device of the first person narrative. It probably deserves a place in the bookcase (though not on the same shelf) with Medawar's Pluto's Republic, Koestler's The Sleepwalkers and Barzun's Science: The Glorious Entertainment.ribution to In Pursuit of Truth (ed P.

Hacohen reports that he worked for 360 days of the year, all day, without the distraction of newspapers, radio or TV. Several times a month, even in old age, he worked all night and friends such as Bryan Magee would get an early morning call from Popper, bubbling with excitement to report on his latest ideas. Popper lived well out of London near High Wycombe and when Magee gained Popper's confidence he was invited to visit, taking the train to \\"Havercombe\\" (in Popper's heavily accented English). When I made the trip to Havercombe, Popper arranged to meet me at the station, carrying a copy of the BBC Listener, presumably to pick him out from all the other elderly gentlemen of middle-European extraction who might be thronging the platform at 2.00 on a Wednesday afternoon. In the event, he left the magazine at home and the kiosk had sold out so he had to buy The Times and fold it to the size of the Listener. Of course he was the only person in sight apart from the Station Master. Popper, then aged 70, had what his research assistant tactfully described as a \\"very positive\\" attitude to driving. Fortunately it was not far to his home and there were few other cars on the road. Safely home, our conversation laboured, and he frequently pushed a tray of choc-chip cookies towards me. Later he lamented to his assistant that I had eaten a whole weeks supply of his favorite cookies in one afternoon. These aspects of Popper are the other face of the man who some described as \\"the totalitarian liberal\\".<br />Hacohen has provided sufficient background to explain why Popper's ideas were so exciting for some people, and so threatening for others, though it was left to Bill Bartley in the 1960s to articulate the way that Popper had challenged the unstated and uncriticised assumption of \\"justificationism\\" which is the glue that holds together the ideas of the positivists and other \\"true belief\\" philosophers. Popper's lack of progress in the community of professional philosophers needs to be understood against the persisting background of justificationism, subjectivism and determinism which he has criticised in favour of critical rationalism, conjectural objective knowledge and non-determinism.<br />Hacohen has assembled a massive amount of material and a lesser talent in organization would have lost the plot among the details. Helped by a liberal quantity of headings sub-headings and his very clear exposition, he has kept his material under control and kept several balls in the air with superb aplomb. The several balls are Popper's diverse interests and the chaotic events that were going on around him in Vienna, not only among the intellectuals but also in Austrian politics.<br />These events forced Popper to flee to the other side of the world, to New Zealand, surely the antithesis of Vienna in most cultural, intellectual and political respects. There, his campaign for critical rationalism, objectivism and non-determinism was waged in political philosophy. His achievement in writing the two large volumes of \\"The Open Society and its Enemies\\" can be compared with the Battle of Britain, where young pilots held Hitler at bay in the skies over the English Channel. Popper daily patrolled the intellectual stratosphere, challenging Hitler's intellectual henchmen from Plato to modern times. This work would have been an amazing achievement under any circumstances, as it was it had to be done in the face of dreadful news from home (fourteen relatives died in the Holocaust), under the threat of Japanese invasion and against the resistance of his Professor who regarded his research and writing as theft to teaching time.<br />To conclude, this book is a wonderful piece of scholarship and its deserves to be read with close attention by anyone with a shred of interest in the ideas that have shaped the world today. With any luck Popper's ideas will help to shape the world tomorrow. I dissent from Hocohen's reading of Popper's ideas as a prop for social democracy, but anyone imbued with the spirit of critical rationalism can make up their own mind on that.<br />This book is actually worth six stars, so buy two copies, one for your local library.s to be read with close attention by anyone with a shred of interest in the ideas that have shaped the world today.

David Stove has posthumously achieved celebrity status with this book. This status is not well earned because Stove and his claque have completely missed the point of Popper's philosophy and the way that it has sidelined the long-running and pointless academic obsession with knowledge as \\"justified true belief\\".<br />Popper has provided a viable alternative to the \\"justified true belief\\" theory of knowledge. He has propounded a theory of conjectural objective knowledge which grows by conjecture and criticism of various kinds, including the criticism of empirical tests. This is a matter of commonsense and it is not hard to explain to scientists and other practical people who have not had their brains addled by academic philosophy and its fruitless quest for the non-achievable - verified theories or \\"truly justified beliefs\\" or merely theories with a specified numerical probability. Those, like Stove, who think that inductive probabilities can be assigned to theories, have yet to provide the formula after some centuries of effort.<br />The fruitless and boring quest for inductive probabilities has driven many students from the pursuit of rationalist philosophy in search of more interesting and exciting fare, hence the rise of the deconstructionists and post-modernists and other related fads and cults. Stove and others have blamed this tendency on Popper's \\"irrationalism\\" but this is precisely the reverse of the true situation. It is the failure of the positivists and the inductivists to deliver the magic formula which has wrecked their credibility.<br />Popper has provided the antidote to irrationalism but he has been so thoroughly sidelined in academic philosophy that students can only find out about his ideas by accident, apart from the garbled and miseading misconceptions of his thoughts that are perpetuated by his opponents.<br />For a more enlightening introduction to Popper's ideas, in the context of the main postwar philosophical developments, read Bryan Magee \\"Confession of a Philosopher\\".e \\"Confession of a Philosopher\\".	2002-02-08

A white dwarf is a star of massive density. A book qualifies as a &quot;white dwarf&quot; if it is so packed with content that it can be read many times and still yields more insights and understanding each time.  This book is only a hundred pages in length and it covers a range of fundamental issues from philosophy, the nature of freedom and discovery, law and government, money and banking, entrepreneurship and education, the problems of developing countries. It is clearly written and provides an excellent bibliography, including web sites, for futher investigation of his themes.<br />Karun Philip is a practical dreamer, with his head in the clouds of abstract ideas and his feet planted in the earth of the commercial marketplace. In my view this book is almost a white dwarf because the author has managed to convey so many insights by unpacking the implications of the &quot;axiom of fallibility&quot; which is the central organizing principle of the book. He attributes most of the novelty and power of his ideas to the pioneering work of F A Hayek, a man who he describes as too market-oriented for the left but not sufficiently laissez-faire to satisfy the libertarians.<br />The axiom of fallibility tends to meet a mixed reception. Some people consider that it represents a capitulation to irrationalism, to relativism and the feckless attitude of &quot;anything goes&quot;. Others consider that it is old hat, everyone knows about the uncertainty of human knowledge. However the secret of creative scholarship is to take a simple idea and pursue its less obvious consequences and implications. If the idea is sound and the scholar is both resolute and lucky in his sources, influences and insights, the results can change the direction of civilisation.<br />One would have to be a polymath to judge whether Philip's insights are robust in all the areas that he has addressed. In addition, the exposition is too brief to answer the myriad of doubts and objections that critics will provide. It may be that this is not quite a white dwarf, and perhaps Philip's next book, elaborating the themes of this volume, will qualify.<br />Rafe Champion<br />Independent Scholar, Sydney, Australiaprovide.

Hume identified the problem in both domains: there is no logical way to derive either general scientific principles or moral proposals from facts. The first is the problem of induction, the second is the is/ought problem.<br />Both of these problems are overcome by grasping Popper's &quot;Copernican&quot; insight, to accept the conjectural status of scientific knowlege and moral principles. Each can be improved by critical (rational) appraisal but neither can achieve the status of &quot;justified true beliefs&quot;.<br />Calvin Hayes has picked his way through many of the problems that are created by the traditional structure. This is a challenging book which deserves to be widely read and discussed.	2001-08-17

At the same time he observed the progressive takeover of academic Anthropology and related social sciences by the new wave of political correctness and relativism. These essays can be described as a mordant and somewhat mournful reflection on some of the tribal customs of progressive modernists.<br />The essays are grouped in three parts. Those in the first part, \\"Romantic Primitivism: The Anthropological Connection\\" are designed for a broad and general readership, to alert outsiders to some of the foibles of cultural relativists. These are the people who Ian Jarvie described as \\"absolutists at home\\" (in condemning the sins and shortcomings of the western world) and relativists abroad (it's all relative really, however cruel and irrational).<br />The essays in Part II \\"Academic Primitivism: The Political Implications\\" examine the way that romantic tribalism impacted on Karl Polanyi, Isaiah Berlin and Professor Ivan Sutherland, the ill-fated superior of Karl Popper in New Zealand.<br />The main theme of the collection is that all cultures and civilisations need to be judged by much the same set of standards, allowing for a tolerable amount of pluralism. This means that the violent and cruel initiation ceremonies of the Australian and New Guinea natives need to be viewed with the same jaundiced eye as the sadistic rites of passage in some military academies. It means that the revival of the notion of the \\"noble savage\\", originally popularised by Rousseau, is nothing short of disastrous in its implications for policies for indigenous people. Compared with the degenerates of western civilisation, the noble savage, supposedly, has a greater connection to nature and true reverence for it, a deeper spirituality and a genuine sense of community.<br />The essay on Karl Polanyi indicates the capacity of unworldly  academics to take on board irrational and destructive views. He thought he had located the epitome of successful central planning in the West African slave-owning, large-scale human sacrificing kingdom of Dahomey. Sandall has cast a critical eye over Berlin's tolerance of cultural pluralism, claiming that Berlin accepted and promulgated the idea of Herder and the 18th century German romantics that all culture are \\"incommensurable\\" - possibly the first use of that loaded term which recently did so much damage in the hands of Feyeraband and Kuhn. This interpretation of Berlin's thought is vigorously disputed by his admirers.<br />Sandall's writing is clear and vigorous throughout, so anyone will find value in most of the essays, though some may be daunted by the final two pieces in the collection.pirituality and a genuine sense of community. <br />The essay on Karl Polanyi indicates the capacity of unworldly  academics to take on board irrational and destructive views.
