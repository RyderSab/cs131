Early chapters take the reader on a journey through various companies providing an education on the importance of benchmarking, measuring defect rates, implementation strategies, and measuring six sigma performance.  When the book begins to focus on implementation and deployment in later chapters the paint strokes begin to get very broad.  The ideas provided to the reader are oversimplified and basic.  For example, &quot;Companies that improve their ability to consistently meet their customer's needs will produce positive bottom-line results.&quot;  Really?  I believe that the 1% of managers that are unware of this concept are not reading this book.  The inability of this book to lay out a detailed plan for implementation results from the fact that each business is significantly different.  If after reading this book the six sigma concept is appealing one could consider employing a consultant or creating a team for implementation.  In my opinion the book also applies more to businesses with easily measurable performance such as manufacturing products as opposed to service providing businesses.  Although customer satisfaction can be measured it is much easier to note an increase in monthly unit production.  In summary six sigma is a difficult concept to initiate without the full commitment of your management team but the individual businessman will gain some valuable managerial skills through the book's good advice.	2002-10-17

The book describes the actions of two mice, Sniff and Scurry, and two \\"little people\\", Hem and Haw that reside in a maze searching for cheese.  The maze and cheese are representative of life and our goals respectively.  The four have different personalties which become evident as they search for cheese throughout the maze.  Each find cheese early in the story and are joyous of how life can be so good.  Then, as in life, the cheese begins to decrease in amount and is eventually moved and the different personalties become evident.  Sniff reacts quickly and begins to search for new cheese.  Scurry, searches for cheese with Sniff and races ahead for new cheese when Sniff gets him close.  Hem just cannot seem to understand why the cheese was moved, refuses to accept the fact that the cheese is gone and is unwilling to search for a new source.  Haw also has the problem of accepting this change but after a prolonged contemplation eventually conquers his fears of looking for new cheese and moves back into the maze.  Haw reflects upon the events and realizes that he should have recognized the diminishing cheese supply and reacted earlier.  He also vows never to let it happen again.  After finding a new source of cheese Haw continues to search for new cheese supplies.  Hem never looks for any new cheese which suggests he perishes.  Sniff and Scurry become complacent again enjoying new cheese not thinking of the possibility of diminishing supply and will once again have to react quickly when the supply is gone.  The bottom line is recognize change early, prepare for bad times by continually searching out new sources when times are good, and be willing to change your course of action if your current actions are getting you the wrong results.  There, now you don't even have to buy the book.	2002-09-24

The author has concentrated his efforts in providing a synopsis of global geography.  The book is divided into four parts.  The first provides an overview of geography that introduces the terminology and basic maps reading skills.  The second and third parts include a total of twenty chapters dedicated to describing and illustrating the geographical features of the earth.  Only major geographic features are presented in these chapters.  The reader should not expect descriptions of smaller features.  For example the chapter discussing North America is accomplished in twelve pages.  But at the end of those twelve pages the reader should have a mental sketch of the terrain including major rivers, mountain ranges, surrounding bodies of water, bordering countries and large lakes. Reciting and locating Canada's ten provinces and two territories will also be a much easier task.  The final part of the book deals with population growth and environmental issues that effect our planet.  Minimal information is provided on the cultural and social aspects of each geographic region.  This exclusion has been noted as an oversight or deficiency by previous reviewer's.  However if I may retort, the author has developed a reference book that strictly follows the definition of geography.  Geography is defined as the study of the earth and it's features.  Certainly these features affect how we interact with each other but any attempt to touch upon them is beyond the scope of this book.  Readers should refer to geography books pertaining to the specific region of interest for detailed information regarding the relationships of those cultures.  For those searching for detailed information on specific regions will also find this book inadequate and ultimately be disappointed.  The books weakness is that the maps are black and white, very simplistic and unexciting.  Overallthe book provides an excellent geographical overview of the earth and is recommended for those readers who are looking to recapture what they have forgotten since high school geography.	2002-08-14

Scarcely illustrated, this is a fully encompassing text which provides a brief description of each event. Most descriptions range in length from one-quarter to one-half of a page. For example, it required less than two-hundred words to recount the assasssination of President Kennedy. Lengthy historical events such as the Vietnam War are also discussed in a concise manner. The Vietnam War required seven pages, including the full page map, to educate the reader. Those interested in an American History book that can be enjoyably read cover to cover must look elsewhere. Brief, fragmented event depictions cause the reader's attention to quickly wane. This book is being awarded four stars for its use as an encyclopedia.	2002-01-19

The definitions of most words searched have been easily understood by my nine year old son. Some definitions have necessitated my participation to provide a more simplified explanation. A further noted weakness of the dictionary is that a significant number of words fail to provide an example of its use in a sentence. A more consistent usage of this feature would have resulted in a 5 star rating. These faults, however, are minor and should not deter the reader from purchasing this dictionary. Some noteworthy unexpected strengths of the dictionary was the inclusion of a reference section containing maps of the world and seven continents, illustrations of the flags of the world, a list of the 50 states and their capitals, and a listing of the Presidents and Vice-Presidents of the United States. A recommended companion to the dictionary is The American Heritage Children Thesaurus.	2002-01-05

This book has the advantage of not requiring lengthy character introductions.  However in the book's beginning chapters the author has intermittently provided brief overviews about the first books events.  Although helpful to novice Harry Potter reader begining with book two, the overviews can be somewhat distracting to the veteran reader who is anxiously anticipating future happenings. Thankfully most of the first book's information is successfully regurgitated early on and both novice and veteran reader alike are quickly boarded on the Hogwart's Express.  This book's plot tends to be more suspenseful and intricate.  With each successive chapter the reader is involved more deeply in this magical mystery.  In summary I can only comment on the fact that I have begun book three without hesitation.	2001-12-13

Through the simplistic process of mentoring, knowledge is unselfishly shared with others, creating an unmeasurable positive impact on their lives.

Mr. Robbins, the reader must remember, is not only an affable author but an adroit salesman.  Keeping this in mind, the book suggests several simplistic methods that the average person could easily incorporate into their daily lives that would result in significant improvements.  Much time is spent enthusiastically educating the reader on the importance of self motivation.  Techniques that assist the reader in realigning their values with their goals are discussed in detail.  However, chapters dealing with NLP (neuro-linguist physiology) may be difficult for a reader with no previous knowledge of NLP to interpret.  The average reader will be thankful that the chapters dedicated to NLP are few.  The portion of the book dedicated to effective comunication I found to be highly insightful.  In summary, I believe this book is an excellent starting point for readers interested in self-help education.	2001-12-12

Recent concerns that this book may cause an uprise in the practice of witchcraft amongst children are ridiculous in my opinion.  I seriously doubt that one book could undermine or alter a child's chosen beliefs and values formed by years of proper parenting and mentoring. This happens to be an exceptionally written fantasy which contains captivating characters that entertain both young and old alike.  After a slow and somewhat still beginning describing Harry's circumstances and character inrtoductions the reader is magically transported to the enchanting world of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. From there the excitement begins.  Anyone seeking a fantasy story should read this superb book.	2001-12-12

Perhaps Mr. Covey has the time to list each of his key roles and create 2 weekly goals for each role and then document those goals on a weekly scheduler, but I certainly do not. In fact, I believe that the committment to adhere to such a system would result in my stressful demise. I am disheartened that I had to write such a vitriolic review of this book.

I must admit I was somewhat incredulous about reading a book about water.  However, the author captured my attention early in the first chapter and I found the book difficult to put down thereafter.  My expectations of reading material suggestive of an impending water shortage were quickly cast aside.  The author demonstrates significant evidence that the world is currently embroiled in a crisis of which most individuals are unware. The mere thought that countries may be led to war to secure a water supply, no matter how realistic, is disheartening.

Generating lists of personal goals, beliefs and values is once again encouraged. The importance of expanding your vocabulary in order to be a more effective communicator is discussed in detail.

Any disappointment that the reader encounters is probably a result of the fact that Mr. Buffett leads an exceptionally mundane life.
