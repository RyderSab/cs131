For instance, when discussing why Jane Austen must be considered among the geniuses of literature, he only mentions one of her novels in detail in order to prove his argument. This is basically the same method he utilizes for all of the writers, although Shakespeare does receive extra attention. He only covers those writers who are deceased, yet he ignores many who, in my opinion, deserve to be credited as literary geniuses. This is because his focus is on the Western Canon.	2004-08-03

It starts out similar to a detective novel since the reader has to figure out whether or not a soldier from the Vietnam War is  directly responsible for the disappearance and possible death of his wife.   However, this extraordinary novel also focuses on a horrible incident that  took place during the war and resulted in the deaths of innocent victims.   A main point of the novel is how people sometimes refuse to accept or to  realize the psychological effects of a war.	2000-05-28

This story explores the lives of his ancestors, both from  the maternal and paternal sides of the family.  I agree that some of the  characters have short stories about them since there are just a bit too  many characters that the author wants to discuss.  These stories  mostly  deal with the topic of romance, but there are several which talk about real  historical events that took place.  A main focus is also how Bruce Patman  became so wealthy and ended up living in Sweet Valley.	2000-05-23
