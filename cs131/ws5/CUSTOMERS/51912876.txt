This is an authoritative textbook on ion channels that is often quoted in numerous textbooks in neurophysiology. Hille himself has contributed a lot in this field. The Hogkin-Huxley model is the de facto standard model in neurophysiology but certain things about neurons cannot be explained only with voltage-controlled sodium and potassium channels. With the patch-clamp technique, we have found a way to explore other interesting channles. To remind you, there are a world of ion channels! Hille's textbook show there are indeed a variety of channels most of which are poorly understood. As a reviewer below has commented, it also gives a unique insight into the history of neural membrane research. Concepts are explained with clearity. Details measurement techniques.	2001-08-13

The book cover boasts that this is the only book with through discussions in mathematical equations, etc. Indeed! Except that there are other mathematically oriented books with kindly worked out examples. Some concepts, such as deriviation of the cable equation, were wonderfully presented. However, no attempt is made to obtain the solution. To think about it, that might have been an appropriate choice, for a physiologist does not have to know all the mathematics. However, the Rall model (Sec. 3.5) should have been approached in analogy with impedance matching. A unique feature of this book was somewhat detailed discussion of the Stochastic nature of ion channels. This is a good book, I believe. Overall, mathematics is thorough and abstract concepts are well chewed over.	2001-08-13

To be quite honest the approach was not entirely satisfactory nor is there any attempt to go beyond the passive membrane.

One is obviously J.D. Jackson and the other E.M. Purcell. If Griffiths follows Purcell's approach, I'd say Wangsness is in the style of Jackson (of course no direct comparison is possible, Jackson does not really discuss statics anyway). <br />Wangness is very much _detailed_ and provides ample examples, many of them kindly worked out. I am not sure if this book provides strong background in vector calculus, though. I always had troubles getting some geometrical intuitions.

I think not. Still, in most colleges, _chaos_ is a subtopic you briefly go through (most of the time just `skipped' through) while studying differential equations, mathematical physics or classical physics. To be competely honest, my impression is that those ``subtopics'' usually don't make a good intro to chaotic dynamics, either. I have read some textbooks targeted at undergraduates and Gulick's was not too bad to skim through what we have in chaotic dynamics. However, Gulick pays too much attention on the basics (analysis and differential equations) and this may seem such a waste of space given the limited number of pages (some two hundreds). Naturally, his explanations are not detailed and gives the impression that things are done rather hastily. But, I must say, this book is superier to some other books that spends time neither on the basics nor the analytic aspects of chaotic dynamics.	2001-05-02

I bought this book for self-study. The official textbook at my college was Wangsness and it was just formidable to look at. However, Griffiths did not really help me overcome the kind of phobia i had at the time: my real problem was mathematics. (To come to think of it, a good student does not need ``many'' books.) Well, as I said, this book does not have it all but it is a good book. Except for just one thing: I would be glad if he'd be a little more elaborate on the use of Dirac delta function.<br />Compared to 2/e, this book is wonderfully typeset.

And quite legitimately so,  I must say. Hardy had personally witnessed the War and how it transformed  the academia. His fellow mathematicians became a part of war efforts and  his highest philosophy--mathematics--degraded into an engine of various  killing devices. Against this background, why he chose the number theory is  obvious: it had no immediate practical applications. Today this is not  entirely true. Number theory is what's behind modern cryptography. For many  of lay people, Hardy is remembered principally as a discoverer of S.  Ramanujan, an incredible mathematical genius. Hardy also set an example of  what a scholary collaboration should be like. His lifetime collaboration  with Littlewood is unparalled in history of mathematics.

Several years back, I was an economics major, sniffing around in math and  physics sections in the library when I had spare time or exams are over.  Then I picked it up (it was blue-covered then). A few hours later, I was at  a college book shop and I bought this book without giving a second thought!  It didn't stop me there. I am a physics major now. <br />I got into college in  1994. That's when Hawking's sensational (though not understandable) Brief  History of Time was sweeping through every intellectual discussion and  everyone had this weird fantasy about physics. But it wasn't persuasive  enough and physics to me was still an esoteric, dry, and boring sort of  field. Feynman showed this is not true. (Now I realize it is indeed dry, if  not esoteric and boring.)<br />Though thoroughly entertaining, this book is  rather weak on the sort of frustrations that all the participating  scientists in the bomb-making project seemed to have undergone. Plus,  contrary to your hope, Feynman was not really a nice man. A good biography  on him is done by a physics historian, Jagdish Mehra. I am compelled to add  that James Gleick's Genius does no more than reproducing stories already  told by Feynman himself right in this book.	2000-08-27

Bell's Men of Mathematics, this book does not  contain romantically presented stories of some math heros. And unlike some  popular math books by Ian Stewart, it does not attempt to explain (rather  unsuccessfully) some esoteric theories. It is just as the title  suggest--what a mathematical experience can be. A book of this kind is  rare.<br />P.S.

The part one, which takes up more than a half of the whole book, explains what recurrent neural networks are and how  those can be used to explain our own cognitive functions. This is generally  a good introduction, I think. His style is casual, and we see certain  smugness you normally expect at a college lecture, e.g., introducing  certain authorities as his friends and presenting the picture his own  daughter and the medial and lateral brain stereographs of his wife  (Patricia Churchland). Like other popular science books, however, his  description of neural nets is far from precise but let's not expect too  much from a book of this kind. Unlike what some of our reviewers below  suggested, he minimizes the use of scientific jargons and when he use such  jargons he explains what those are. The first part was overall very much  enjoyable to read.<br />You cannot expect it to be a fully philosophical book,  though. His new epistemological framework arises from this newest  perspective the theory of neural networks has created. To know what neural  nets are is immensely important. Let's remind ourselves of a classic work  in cognitive science and neurobiology. It's David Marr's _Vision_. There  Marr expresses the view that physical (hardware) implementation is quite  irrelevant. Now we know this is not true. To understand why this is so one  may have to consult the part one.<br />The problem area is the part two. The  chapter 11 was full of hopes and lots of blah-blah-blah's that bore you to  hell. What's interesting, and makes you slightly angry, is his explanation  of consciousness. Perhaps that is because Churchland's argument seem  amazingly simple. But, to think about it, it has to be simple. Otherwise it  cannot be a reduction. If you want to argue against reductionism, you need  to bring up some form of dualism. In fact, this is what Searle does.  Searle's arguments are not directed agains neural networks. His favorate  scapegoat is symbolic computation. But this is something researchers have  done away with a long ago. I personally think Searle never really  understood what neural nets are.<br />What's not really satisfactory are  these: Some will find he never really defeated Nagel and Jackson. I should  agree with those who think so. If ever he did, his argument lacked logical  clearity or I am very dumb. He is not successful in constructing a model of  consciousness, either. The problem is, he thinks he is. Like Newton did,  and Euclid earlier, he tries to create a set of descriptive axioms to come  to grip with consciousness. But unlike Euclid, Netwon, and Einstein  (remember his two postulates), some of his axioms require a first-person  perspective. (ref. pp. 213-214) For example, to verify that consciousness  disappears in deep sleep, somebody obviously has to go to bed. However  imprecise, MEG maybe used to detect conscious activities in a live brain.  But there exists no 3rd-person method to verify consciousness is a single  unified experience. Churchland has been successful in explaining a lot but  I think we still have a long way to go. And his descriptive theory is not  adequate.<br />Plus, there is a misprint in page 230 of the softcover edition.  The &quot;o%cial&quot; should be read &quot;official&quot;.	2000-08-25

Very much accessible  and provides a rare chance to look into the minds of the giants. To  introduce some of them:<br />Hans Bethe. A teacher, collaborator, and good  friend of R.P. Feynman. Participated in the Manhattan Project and helped  create the bomb. The man who first realized what fuels the sun. Got his  Nobel Prize for this realization (1967, thermonuclear processes).<br />P.A.M.  Dirac. Created relativistic quantum mechanics and so-called the  &quot;symbolic formulation&quot; of quantum mechanics (the bra-ket  notation). His theory formed a basis for later developments of quantum  electrodynamics (QED). More of a mathematician. Had a very deep faith in  mathematics. Seldom talked in public.<br />Werner Heisenberg. Father of _the_  quantum machanics. His formulation parallels Erwin Schrodinger's in that,  though they used different mathematical languages, they described the same  thing. Heisenberg's so-called &quot;matrix formulation&quot; was made  possible by his great collaborators, i.e., Jordan, Born and Bohr. He was in  the German camp when the major forces concentrated their powers in  developing the A-bomb. Heisenberg had thought an A-bomb was a theoretical  impossibility. Philosophically, he was forever a disciple of Niels Bohr.  With Bohr, he was the guru of an orthodox interpretation of quantum  mechanics, known as the Copenhagen Interpretation.<br />Eugene Wigner. A  mathematician who won a Nobel prize in physics. A classmate of J. von.  Neumann. He had a kind and gentle personality (quite rare among famous  physicists). Wigner was the man who gave a Ph.D. to E. Jaynes, who was  doing research on QED under Oppenheimer and had some difficulties in  accepting quantum mechanics. Wigner, too, had troubles with the Copenhagen  Interpretation and presented a unique interpretation that takes  consciousness into account. To mostof us, known by his 3-j symbol.<br />Too  bad that Landau (a god figure in condensed matter physics) was not there to  share his insights.	2000-08-24

After initial introductory courses, I got  fascinated by certain untold conceptual issues. And one of the textbooks  (probably Griffiths) suggested von Neumann had tried to prove  mathematically that the classical formulation is just the furthest the  formalism can go and we don't have to worry about underlying complexities.  Later, Bohm created a formalism which von Neumann &quot;proves&quot; to be  mathematically impossible in this book. I bought this book just to find out  how the proof goes. But I got stuck with some tedious proofs on Hilbert  space (which he calls a &quot;digression&quot;). This part isn't essential  but as the braket notation is not used you need to consult this part. I  think at least a strong background in linear algebra is required. Definitly  not an introductory textbook. Most useful for those who study history of  physics.	2000-08-23

Which is pity, to think about  it, since Parmenides is to this day considered to be one of the most  esoteric. Contrast to Parmenides, where young Socrates stands up against  this old thinker, Phaedo reveals old Socrates who now discusses things in  fully down-to-earth terms. In fact, Socrates at this time is a dying one.  And his tragic end is so well presented that it actually reads like a  novel. Back to my point, this book is, I think, the most appropriate as a  starter. Then you could trace back to Plato's more abstract discussions.  Nowhere in Plato's works his conception of the idea is more clearly  explained than in Phaedo. This also summarizes Plato's outlining of  philosophy. A must-read.	2000-08-23

Better still, it contains direct  responses from Dennett,  Chalmers and paranthetically from Penrose. And those responses serve to  reveal symptoms of communication failure. Perhaps rather more surprising is  Searle's rather lame postscript in pp. 130-131 (in response to Dennett's  letter). No, I take it back. It is scarcely suprising compared to his  conception of the simulation. This he explains in his brief communication  with Roger Penrose. <br />Another gem of this book is the part two of his  conclusion, i.e. 10 FAQ's concerning his philosophical position. However,  it would be far less than satisfying if you had expected it to clarify what  he means by &quot;biological naturalism&quot;. Why a biological organism  would have a privilege in this consciousness business I do not understand.  It slightly reminds me of vitalism, but Searle would fiercefully deny that.  He also rejects dualism. And eliminative reductionism. Then he says,  &quot;We can, in short, accept irreducibility without accepting  dualism.&quot; (p. 214) How? Where he stands I do not know.<br />Nonetheless,  Searle's ideas are thought-provoking and quite indispensable in discussing  philosophical implications of artificial intellligence. We are not talking  about another New Age consciousness bluff here. This book overall gives an  insight into this great thinker's style and attitude towards the matter.  Plus, he never claims he is perfectly correct about all this.<br />Because,  honestly, no one knows what consciousness is. Not even a clue.	2000-08-19

Nearly all of most important philosophical works on consciousness in recent years are brought  together in this single volume. Naturally,  this is a textbook for  graduate-level courses in cognitive science or philosophy of mind. And  makes a quite nice source book for those who want to further their studies  in artifical intelligence.	2000-08-16

Contrary to popular prejudices, this book is not about a future totalitarian world made possible by genetic manipulation. A possibility of cutting &amp; pasting genetic sequences was not known to Huxley. (The idea  of DNA as we know it occurred to Watson in 1953.) In fact, if you read the  book, you will find that making of components of this brave new world is  mainly through hypnophaedia (a kind of brainwashing) and use of drug. So,  is our world in any way similar to the one Huxley describes? Not quite. I'd  say it merely reflects the gloomy outlook the author had in the interval of  two World Wars. Is the book against science? Not really. In fact, the  Controller (in his Fordship) is well aware of the subversive nature of  science. A totalitarian society has to control science, he says. If any  one's going to argue that this book is for anti-science, he might have to  rephrase: it is about controlled use of science. Overall, like Orwell's  1984, this book is about totalitarian society, where a person's free will  is simple luxury. Wait, does &quot;free will&quot; exists? Consult  Skinner's Walden Two.	2000-05-31
US	51912876	R39X1O0OE45LOA	0136638163	246850929	Philosophy and Artificial Intelligence	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Fair	This is not an exceedingly nice book. However, it served to clear up some of the confusions I had previously. The purpose of this book is clear. It is a philophical textbook for the beginning undergraduate level. As the  book goes on, there appear, in my opinion, certain misrepresentations,  especially those concerining connectionism. However, the historical  introduction in the first chapter was very much enjoyable and other  philosophical concepts are presented very lucidly.	2000-05-18

Beautiful as it may seem, the simple is often deceptive. Like the famous Maxwell's equations in differntial form. They look beautifully simple. But to apply it requires another not very  simple form. Minsky tells us that what seem simple enough to us (so simple  that we are hardly aware of) are actually very hard to implement in  machines. So the biggest question in artificial intelligence is to simulate  simple human tasks. Minsky is not like some lousy popular textbook writers.  He seeks to find an answer, and all along, he does not attempt to make a  logical 'jump'. The book is full of ideas. Though not with any big promises  or big future plan, it gives you practical insights (such as why 'agents'  should be simple enough, when the 'agencies' are not. Highly recommended to  those who want to see the practical side of artificial intelligence. Like  the integral form of Maxwell's equations.	2000-05-15

Decartes stands on the fine line between the mechanical viewpoint and traditional ideas of soul, vortices, and light travels faster in media. The author is  not happy about the mechanical viewpoint. Logic is indeed simplistic. There  seem no place for &quot;quality&quot; or semantics in logic. But if logic  can't do it, what other alternatives do we have? Like Marvin Minsky once  remarked, if a thinking process cannot be reduced to something simplistic  (like turning on and off the switchboard), the whole situation would be  pretty much like a dwarf in the chess-playing machine. The book was  easy-to-read and full of energy. However, I had to ask, &quot;so  what?&quot;.	2000-05-15

This book was THE  ONLY BOOK that taught me how to do that. Now, I learn very nice things  about fields (such as there exists no electric field inside a hollow shell  of a conducting body) and mathematically how such is possible! Overall, I  must say, this book is different.	2000-04-08

Watson was brilliant in bringing pieces of his vague memory and prejudices. What we have here is in part the fact of history and in part a very enjoyable work of fiction.<br />Really, people who read this book usually  finishes in a few hours. This is amazing compared to the time it takes to  read the hopeless eulogy given by Anne Sayer. <br />However, as a man of  considerable authority, Watson should have taken the usual scholary  precautions and double-chekced when he was talking about  &quot;people&quot;. I think any serious reader must consult Anne Sayer,  albeit painful, for a balanced viewpoint.	2000-02-05

Another case of human injustice and pure stupidity of colleagues. It is strange that I am usually drawn more to the stories of social minorities whose brilliance is eclipsed by prejudices and uneducated, inconsiderate,  or plainly foolish pranks by people like James Watson or Otto Hahn (linked  to Lise Meitner, discovered nuclear fission).<br />Then I find many others  share the same feeling of compassion or maybe sympathy. Why? Perhaps  because we all are minorities before the establishment of the few. I also  find a mystery there--why do we get so blind when we are in such an  establishment?<br />Gotta read it if you want to have a balanced viewpoint.
