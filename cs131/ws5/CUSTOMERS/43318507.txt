Another thrilling tale woven by a true master.  While this book is not quite as strong as his first novel it is right there with it and will be sure to trap all who read it.  Be sure to read Riordan's other great works as well.  This is one of America's best mystery writers of today.	2005-10-04
US	43318507	RLSCWYO0BB6B8	0553576445	938782521	Big Red Tequila	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Must Read	This is Rick Riordan's first novel and it is wonderful.  Tres Navarre is introduced (as this is a series) as a PI in San Antonio.  This book will delight those who like mystery/thrillers or books that take place in Texas.  Riordan is a masterful writer who does an extremely well job of describing his characters and surrounds.  Read this book and the ones that follow and you will not be dissappointed.	2005-10-01

I was hooked after reading his first book, \\"Big Red Tequila.\\"  This may be the most \\"mature\\" Navarre book to date and will leave you wanting more.  I couldn't put this book down and literally flew through it.  Now I am left anxiously awaiting his next book.  I highly recommend any book by Riordan; keep 'em coming Rick.	2005-10-01

With hundreds of management books out there, very few deal with this industry, which is one of the most dynamic ones in the world.  While not a true management book, it does offer lots of insight and ideas for those in the industry.  I highly recommend this book.	2005-09-27

I actually played football at Midland High and my senior year we tied Permian in District.  \\"Friday Night Lights\\" the movie (based on this book) is excellent as well and I highly recommend it.  On many levels this book changed the landscape of not just HS sports, but sports at all levels, as it brought to light just how big football is in Texas, and at the HS level no less.  The book goes beyond football though, touching on religion, race, soci-economic, etc...  Captivating.  I highly recommend this book.	2005-09-25

Writers just don't write with the convictions and ideas that Rand did anymore.  While the volume of the book may be intimidating, by the time you get to the end you will wish there was more.  A must read and must own.  I recommend this for everyone.	2005-09-19

Warren basically breaks things down and says, Look, this is what is important in life and that is what we are hear for.  In a fast paced and constantly changing world of me, me, me, megalomania, commercialism, and the all important bottom line, this book will allow to break down your day and help you to get through, especially in the tight and stressful times.  I was happy with my life and content with what was going on in it.  I don't go to church regularly, hardly at all in fact, but I do pray every night.  This book helped me improve my spiratuallity and relationship with God.	2005-09-16

Think the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" but centered around Vlad Tepes III, the Impaler (the real life Dracula whom Brom Stroker used in his novel).  My only knock on this book, and here it is more personal then anything else, but it took me forever to get through this book, but the second half was a lot faster.  But again, this is just me.  Kostova is an extremely gifted writer who has done her homework.  You will not be dissappointed with this masterpiece.	2005-09-15

While Hemingway is a talented writer with wonderful prose, I just couldn't get into the story or even really care about it.  I don't know if that is due to some sort of generational or time gap, or maybe his stories just aren't for me.  I might read another Hemingway book, but not any time soon.	2005-09-06

I picked this book up because I wanted something that took place in Tennessee; I can now tell you that location plays absolutely nothing in this book, in fact it is mentioned once, maybe twice that they are in Knoxville.  However, that is not why I gave this book 3 stars, IMHO this book is just that, a middle of the road novel.  Enjoyable enough, but not great.	2005-09-06

Most of the book takes place in Bologna, Italy which really appeals to me since the fraternity I was in in college has its origins in that city.  Basically if you like any of Grisham's Books or Movies then you will like this one.  I also recommend it for anyone looking to read Grisham for the first time or who just wants a good gov. thriller.	2005-09-05

I found it boring and long winded at times.  Now I can see where this book was groundbreaking for its day and age and I can appreciate the controversy that surrounds out, but on an entertainment/enjoyable level it missed the mark completely with me.  I read \\"Nine Stories\\" and really liked it (especially \\"Teddy\\"), but this book ended any desire for me to ever read Salinger again.	2005-09-03

Plainly, this book sucked and I'm not saying that because it offended me or my religion, I just didn't like it and thought it was poorly written.

Since its release it has sent me clamoring for Brown's other novels (Look for \\"Angels and Demons\\" as it is the first book in which Robert Langdon appears) and other books of this genre.  While many fans of this book are eagerly awaiting a the May 2006 release of the \\"DaVini Code\\" movie, look for \\"National Treasure\\" to fill your needs in the mean time.  Otherwise if you are looking for a fresh new thriller pick up this novel today!	2005-09-02

It is also a break from the norm from your typical thriller as the two main character are more researchers and book worm then they are action adventure heroes.

However, \\"Digital Fortress\\" is definately more of a thriller then a mystery, the way \\"Code\\" and \\"A&D\\" were.

Yes, Jenna Jameson is a porn star, and yes she and other members of her family have done drugs, so if you want to write them off as bad and worthless go ahead, but you won't like this book.  Not that I am condoning drugs or sex, but what do you expect the life of a porn star to be like. <br /> <br />That aside I think JJ does a great job talking about the mistakes she's made the lessons learned from them.  In fact I think certain parts of the book would be beneficial to teen girls and even boys - with all the hormones, change, and new discoverys they have going on in their lives.   <br /> <br />This book is both very entertaining and very informative, I definately recommend it.	2005-08-29

However, it is not Jimmy's best work.  I was hoping for something along the line of \\"Where is Joe Merchant\\" and this was not the case.  Jimmy picks up with a character from his short story 'Take Another Road' from his book, \\"Tales From Magaritaville.\\"  The book just about begins where the story left off (Tully Mars is on fictional Cayo Loco instead of Key West).  The first part of the book drags on almost without a purpose.  While the second half does improve and even keeps you turning the page at some points, it is not enough to make this a great read.  I recommend this to all Parrot Heads, but to the average reader or someone who is looking to pick up a Jimmy Buffett book I would suggest you start elsewhere.	2005-08-29
