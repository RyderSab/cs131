The CD fails to load the Linspire system and run live as it is supposed to do. I am certain the problem does not lie with my PC due to the fact that I can load Mepis, Knoppix etc. without any problem. The book states that if you encounter problems to search the Linspire forums for help. I do not feel I should have to search all over the net for help that may or may not be of any use. I want to be able to load and GOOOO!!! <br />Big disappointment for a Peter Van Der Linden  fan!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Phoenix guy.....	2005-08-23
