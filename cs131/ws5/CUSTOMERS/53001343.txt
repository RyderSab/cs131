The voices are fine for the women characters, but HORRIBLE when the reader is doing men's voices.  Especially annoying when it's American men.  Skip the audio version.	2004-09-17

I felt as if the authors were trying to increase their page count by putting in way too many descriptors about things that didn't need describing.<BR>The love story is ridiculous.  It is forced into the narrative like a square peg in a round hole.  I skipped all the things about &quot;our eyes met, and I felt myself blush&quot; etc.  Come on Jonna, you are a master of disguise and you can't disguise the fact that you slept with your boss the night before?  <BR>The spy story is interesting, although lacking some details understandably to protect on-going missions.<BR>A beach read.	2004-03-19

The characters were well-developed and their interactions were believable.  The pace was quick and made for an easy read.  I rushed to the end, but savored the last few chapters because I hated for the book to end.  Looking forward to the next book by this mother-daughter team!!!!	2004-01-20

Instead, I found myself irritated at the tedious pace and extraneous details.  I didn't care for any of the characters, and by the time I realized it wasn't going to get any better...I was in too deep and had to finish out the 9+ hours to find out whodunnit.  At least it kept me awake for the drive.  Nevermore.	2003-09-20
US	53001343	R1YJZE2GKJKL3P	0553802461	288141977	Dead Aim	Books	1	6	8	N	N	Awful	Like a previous reviewer, I won't read Iris Johansen again.  I got sick and tired of Alex's stupid attitude of shunning any protection, fighting Morgan every step of the way, and then found it hard to believe they end up in bed.  Even more unbelievable is the part where Alex dictates to the assasin Runne the terms under which she will meet him, arrogantly telling him she will kill him.  SNORT!  Give me a break! The only reason I finished this silly tall tale of a book is that I wanted to find out what Z3 is.  Now, I'm through with this author and her ridiculous heroine.	2003-08-17

I bought this book at full hardcover price (silly me!) because of that.<BR>I couldn't get interested in the plot of John gone missing, nor Winnie herself as a character.  I tried 118 pages, and just gave up because I don't care how it turns out.  One of the worst books I've ever attempted to read, and only the second that I've been unable to finish.  Buy something else!	2002-08-26
US	53001343	RWETQ0U3CN79Y	0375501851	363806782	White Teeth	Books	5	3	6	N	N	Stunning, and funny	I read great reviews, so I was hesitant to start this book for fear of being disappointed.  What  a pleasant surprise to find the writing of a high caliber, with interesting and unlikely characters.  At times the historical bits drag, but for the most part I found the plot to move nicely.  I was surprised by the ending, expecting it to be more dramatic, but I still liked it.  A great big substantial read.	2001-05-10

Like one of the other reviewers, I could only make it halfway through and left it in the hotel trashcan (so the maid wouldn't waste her time on the book). Also, the boys with girls names and girls with boys names got old quickly (as did the IChing business, and the lectures on the overroasted coffee beans). Perhaps I would have liked this better if I hadn't just finished the wonderfully written White Teeth by Zadie Smith...	2001-05-10

The pizza dough is delicious as is the shrimp toast, ginger-scented pecans, and the white wine punch.  However, some of the ingredient amounts are way off (you end up with too much of one hard-to-use-in-another-recipe item like leeks) and preparation was much too labor intensive.  For example:  &quot;using three sizes of melon ballers, make melon balls and place them on a cookie sheet making sure none of them touch.&quot;  It can be simplified by the cook  - I used one melon baller, put all the melon balls in a tray, froze them even though they were touching and everything worked fine.  Good ideas, difficult execution.  Beautiful pictures.	2000-12-19

The writing seemed forced (meeting a deadline, perhaps?) and the sentences  read like haiku rather than prose.  Example:  &quot;Firm and loud.  No one  to hear her.  The missus was upstairs.  So many other rooms between them,  all empty and closed off.&quot;  The shifting point of views were  distracting.  It would have been an excellent book if he had chosen Billy's  voice as the main one.  Petra was a whiny character for such a  &quot;strong&quot; woman.  Skip this one, read the Delaware novels.	2000-09-04

As an American-born Chinese woman of about Mona's age, I thoroughly identified with some aspects of Mona's coming of age (my nickname was Changowitz too!). I was disappointed at the uneveness of the novel, but  when it was funny, it was laugh-out-loud funny.  The fact that the two  girls, Mona and Barbara, remain friends through thick and thin was a nice  realistic touch.  However, what happens with Mona and Seth in the epilogue  was a big letdown.  I thought Mona a much stronger character than the  epilogue suggests.  Good beach book.	2000-08-01

This started out great and I enjoyed the book up to Ceasar's death.  After that, it seems that all Cleopatra did was have sex, obsess about Antony, throw banquets, and repeat.  This book should have been about 500 pages  shorter!  Henry the Eighth is still my favorite.	1999-11-10

By the second half hour, i was engrossed in the story, BUT I ABSOLUTELY HATED the reader's imitation of: 1)Featherstone, 2)Mike's wife (#1 and #2 were the  same voice!), 3)any other female and/or child's voice.  Annoying falsetto!	1999-11-10

Otherwise one feels almost sorry for the pettiness and smallness of these folks(but then you remember these people have BILLIONS of dollars).  That whole Gardiner chapter was  pathetic.

I  gave away my copy after reading the first 30 pages.<br />PS I agree, eve is  more annoying than the characters in Ya-Ya Sisterhood!	1999-08-02

Ending was a bit dull.	1999-04-25

The dialogue was inane and I really didn't even care about the ending which was hard to understand.  The alleged tension between  Carlotta and Sam was not developed or believable.  Completely mediocre, i  read it because i was on vacation and there weren't any other books around.	1999-03-08

The narrative changes point of view from chapter to chapter, and all the characters seem one  dimensional (eg.,BiDi is vain, Sergio is sweet, Franny is tough etc).   Unlike Patty Jane, I could easily see where each plot line was headed.   Hope the next book is more like the the House of Curl.	1999-02-16

When i told people i was reading a book about Henry VIII, nobody could not  believe i would spend time reading about history.  This wasn't just  history, this was getting to know an incredible man.  The writing was  wonderful, the story moved along quickly, and sometimes i had to remind  myself that although it was fictionalized, these were mostly true events.   My only regret is that it was almost too large to lug along as reading  material while standing in line - a  minor  complaint at that.	1998-09-17

Come on, he spoon-fed us the culprit  with the description of his obessisive behavior early on.  It was then just  a matter of figuring out how Margolin would decide the killer would be  revealed.  The characters were very flat, the dialogue inane, and the  thought that Matt and Abbie would ever be on the verge of marriage is  unbelievable.  I guess the moral of the story is &quot;You can't always get  what you want&quot; (and I don't want anymore by this author).	1998-09-15

The imagery inudated the reader LIKE ice pellets on the street during a storm.  It was rather disjointed and difficult to follow LIKE a winding country road.  After awhile, I began skipping any phrase that followed the word &quot;like&quot;, LIKE a runner rushing towards a finish line.

However, after struggling through the first 100 pages, I still had no interest in the murder of Bruner.  Instead of building the murder case/investigation up, Kanon opts unsuccessfully to develop the romance between Connolley and Emma.  Their stilted conversations became tiresome, and Kanon's feeble attempt to portray the two as flirtatious fell quite flat.  As a thriller, the book is okay.  As a romance, it is unsuccessful.  If you must try this book, go for the paperback version	1997-08-21
