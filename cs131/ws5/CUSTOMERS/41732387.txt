Books	5	9	11	N	Y	A book by an E.C. fan with insight and taste	<br />To be perfectly honest, I've spent all of 15 minutes looking at this book in a comic shop less than 20 minutes ago, but I can tell you it's good.  Whole stories have been reprinted (photographed from printed comics rather than from original art, but the reproduction is good), as well as individual panels and examples from other aspects of their careers.  Each artist is well represented with his best work, and the images are chosen with knowledge and taste.  The biographies are well researched, giving an overview of each artist's career arc.  I could lay in bed for hours looking at this thing, and I intend to.	2005-05-01

Plain language, no wasted words.  Clear drawings.  Do the assignments, it's like taking a class you'd pay $350 for.  I've tried to learn perspective from other books, but they were too complicated.

US	41732387	R205K2AFR6LMJB	0896599434	393063779	The Merchant of Dennis the Menace	Books	5	11	23	N	N	Superb collection of stylish, cold,  empty Dennis art	Hank Ketcham's cartoons are exquisite, absolutely lyrical, yet formula driven.  This is the best collection of his work, and it is very instructive for aspiring cartoonists, because it shows a lot of preliminary sktches and model sheets (similar to the developement of animated films by Disney, where Ketcham worked for a time).  Yet Ketcham was an artistic mediocrity with great technical facility but nothing genuine to say, and he was a stranger to his own family, especially to his son, Dennis.  It's positively weird that Ketcham shows pictures of his son at age 5, the obvious inspiration for the successful strip, but after that HE PRETENDS HIS SON DOESN'T EVEN EXIST! I went through the book several times trying to find out the fate of the real Dennis, but he is simply ignored.  Apparently, Ketcham's wife had psychological problems, the cartoonist divorced her and moved to Switzerland, never speaking to the boy again. Ketcham remarried, his former wife committed suicide,  little Dennis came back from Vietnam with problems that he never fully overcame, and the two had no relationship beyond the stipend his father sent to keep him quiet.  None of this is hinted at in Ketcham's book, which is strictly about how wonderful suburbia is, and how cute that little rascal Dennis is, and how Ketcham's career just went up and up and up.  He made himself a wealthy man by selling the character every which way, eventually training assistants who gradually took over the drawing and writing, leaving Ketcham a rich, leisurely copyright owner.  The gags have an artificial, frozen-in-the-fifties quality, and in all the years I have read it, it has never once been funny, thought provoking or connected to any real feelings.  But the drawing of the characters and backgrounds was (when Ketcham did it personally) unsurpassed in its flowing simplicity, in its bold, unerring design.  He was a true master, and his strip is still being produced, but it is just a meaningless commodity.  I wonderwhere his son Dennis is today?	2004-02-16

There are many books like this, where the &quot;researcher&quot; gathers only those facts which support his predetermined conclusion, carefully filters the data, and asks leading questions of his hand-picked experts, not like a scientist searching for the truth, but like an attorney trying to win a case.  UFO enthusiasts, conspiracy theorists, creationists, and other crackpots try to hijack science to bolster the case for their various obsessions.  Isn't religion supposed to concern the realm of the ineffable, the intangible?  To dissect it as though it is subject to the material claims of everyday reality reduces the divine to the commonplace.	2004-02-01

This is just a re-hash of the few issues of the magazine published without them.  The writing is a weak imitation of Ackerman's lively style, ripping off patented puns like &quot;You Axed for It&quot; and &quot;Beast Wishes&quot;.  Even the cover is a 5th rate copy of a painting from the original magazine.  I hear the current publisher of this volume lost a lawsuit for stealing Ackerman's nom de plume, &quot;Dr. Acula&quot;.  The Famous Monsters of the '50s and '60s was a cool phenomenon once, but the '90s incarnation is a pointless anachronism, since only nostalgic baby-boomers like myself are interested, and there are so many superior efforts dealing with the subject on the market now.  Famous Monsters without Forry Ackerman is like a Beatles reunion without John, Paul, George, or Ringo.	2004-01-25

The beauty of the so-called &quot;Silver Age&quot; of comics (mainly, the 1960s) is the elegance and harmony of the art and story.  This book is another one of that endless invasion of in-your-face, sliced-and-diced compilation pieces that seek to razzle-dazzle the viewer who doesn't think.  Everything is piecemeal, with montages overlapping other montages, fragments of recognizable works blown up to Roy Lichtenstein proportions and overlaid with small, cluttered, unrelated tidbits.  It reduces the work to Pop Art, like printing comic book panels as wall paper, or on kid's bedsheets, for a &quot;campy&quot; effect.  I expected an insightful presentation of what made that decade's comics so meaningful; something coherent, at least.  This book is for people with no attention span (maybe people addicted to video games), who don't even try to understand a story or appreciate a composition, they just want frenzied details flying everywhere so you can't sort it out, like a kaleidoscopic segment of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; compiled by a &quot;hot&quot; editor.  I especially hate magnified images that go off the page with no border, trying to give a &quot;hip&quot; look to the layout.  The value of Marvel comics, especially, was their accessibility, their clarity, their visual solidity.  The comics industry went into a tailspin in the '80s when it was overrun by immature artists who tried to confuse the viewer by losing the center of interest and get by on pyrotechnics.  The text, consisting of a snippet of catty gossip about Stan Lee here, a fragment of anonymous, truncated, corny dialog there, is sprinkled throughout with unrelated &quot;factoids&quot; no more than two or three sentences long, often in the gimmicky type you see in &quot;trendy&quot; magazines about pop music.  It has nothing to say except how smirky and post-modern it is to chop up pieces of the past in a pop-culture blender and splash out a meaningless jumble of images for people to idly glance at, without context or narrative direction.  For the distracted amusement of superficial illiterates only, not for knowledgeable people who like the beauty of an image that hasn't been tampered with, or seek a legitimate history of those creative years.ng to say except how smirky and post-modern it is to chop up pieces of the past in a pop-culture blender and splash out a meaningless jumble of images for people to idly glance at, without context or narrative direction.

Totally slick yet loose and energetic, the inheritor of all that is best in 20th century advertizing/comic strip technique, ornate and slightly old-fashioned looking.  His only rival might be Frazetta.  The reproductions in this book are primo.  The black and white stuff is like finding unread copies of Creepy to enjoy, and there is even a really nice color story- the color added not by the old color separation method, but what looks like watercolor (or maybe dye) over the inks, superbly handled.  Such a classy style, such solid knowledge, such debonair craft, and no so-so early stuff, only mature, full-flavored work.  If you like Williamson, this is the best collection I've seen.	2003-12-22

Penciller Buscema reached a high point at this time, and had top inkers.  Lee's writing is a bit preachy and high-minded, with Surfer redundantly turned into a Christ figure, always saving mankind from some menace, and uncomprehending mankind always reviling him for it.  I was delighted by this stuff at age 13, and it holds up well.  It was the last gasp of greatness before superheroes became (sigh) what they are today.	2003-12-22

Newspaper printing in the '50s wasn't that crisp to begin with, but obviously this was what was available, and so if we are to enjoy these great comics today, it will have to do.  All in all, it is legible (about as good as a quality color xerox from a newspaper), and it's a wonder that these pages of the NY Sunday Mirror were saved at all in such good shape.<br />The stories are absolutely all-time world-class, the drawings are superb and Lil Abner is one of the most memorable comic strips the form has ever produced.  There is also a nice explanation of Al Capp's relationship to Frazetta, and an interesting B/W reproduction of Frazetta's artwork for a parody of the motorcycle flick, \\"The Wild Ones\\", which drew complaints that it was not consistent with the look of the strip (they were right; the book states that afterward Frazetta did not ink his own drawings).<br />I laughed out loud at almost every story.

Robert Mcginnis is the best paperback book illustrator ever (perhaps rivaled only by Frank Frazetta); and 2.) This is the best collection of Mcginnis art available in book form.  There's only one flaw in the whole thing: it never says what medium the artist uses (I found out it's egg tempera).  If you love to gaze at beautiful paintings of every genre subject, or if you are yourself a painter or commercial artist, this belongs on your bookshelf.  I've had it for years, and never tire of looking at it.  A classic.	2003-09-29

Its like sitting with Forry as he goes through the first 50 issues (&quot;the nifty fifty&quot;) and reminisces about the contents of each one.  Along the way he tells amusing (and sometimes sad) anecdotes about the creation of the magazine in his trademark stream-of-consciousness style, sprinkled lightly with the oddball puns you used to love back in the '60s.

If you've seen Paul Coker Jr.'s &quot;Horrifying Clishes&quot; in Mad magazine, you know how great they are.  Paul Coker is one of the greatest cartoonists who ever lived, and the concept behind this series really gives him a chance to show off his unique talent.  <br />BUT...<BR>Somebody thought they'd get fancy and add some color to the drawings, and they MESSED THEM UP!  The color is done on a computer, and it adds very dark areas that throw the beautiful compositions off badly.  Coker himself was obviously not involved in this; it was probably done by some flunky fresh out of a 2nd rate art school working for minimum wage.  It ruins the drawings in many bitterely disappointing instances.  Coker himself has been known to add watercolor or ink wash to some of his work, and he does so with the delicacy and unerring judgement of a master.  Why didn't they consult him, instead of printing blocks of opaque dark green over his exquisite line work?  The color is mechanical and flat, with no sensitivity to form; it gradates from dark to light mathematically, just like a lifeless computer program. It adds nothing and in some cases obscures much.  Shameful. <br />This is still the best collection of Coker's art for Mad, though.  Too bad.	2003-09-05

This isn't even Watts' &quot;best&quot; book, but its the best one to start with if you have reached the intellectual dead-end, as I had as a bright teenager, of &quot;scientific&quot; materialism.  Watts writes in plain language, using everyday examples, and is simply the best translator of Hindu, Toaist and Buddhist philosophies into language that Westerners can easily understand.  He is also a witty storyteller and delightful personality.  If you read this, give it 20 years to sink in before you write your review.  When you finally &quot;get&quot; it, you'll be walking 3 inches off the ground.  Of course, now that everybody you meet is either into quasi-Eastern New-Age beliefs or rutted in reactionary Fundamentalist dogma, the book may read differently.  But it's more likely that Watts' genuine acceptance of human foibles,  egoless wisdom, light-hearted, amused honesty and absolutely penetrating insights into the nature of reality would make &quot;The Book&quot; accessible to any human who likes to think.	2003-08-31

Law enforcement of today doesn't take any of this seriously.  The main consumers of these kind of scare stories are typically people who've led very sheltered lives and are attracted to stories of those who violate society's rules in a horrific way.

Maybe other Frazetta calendars have come out in previous years and they don't want to repeat themselves, but Jaguar God I is compositionally not in a league with Frazetta's best, and Mongol Tyrant is a weak choice for October when Frazetta's great paintings for Creepy magazine are available for a Halloween theme.

It was actually too scary for me.  I was already a big fan of Famous Monsters of Filmland and it's ebullient editor, Forrest j Ackerman.  Soon the names Frazetta, Williamson, Crandall, Morrow, Torres and Archie Goodwin would enter my artistic vocabulary as I became aware of the talent behind the greatest horror comic ever published.  But the editor, one James Warren, remained an enigma.  This book is the best collection of interviews of comic book creators I have ever read.  Night after night, I couldn't put it down.  The interviewer, Jon B. Cooke, is brilliant, his questions incisive, revealing, but never mean.  Boy, that Warren was a genius, but often an eccentric bum!  At least he cared.  I've heard a lot of rumors over the years, and apparently the interviewer has heard the same ones, because he gently prods the real truth out of his unsuspecting subjects, exposing them for the driven, hardworking, pragmatic, vulnerable, prideful, neurotic (in Wally Wood's case, tragically so), but inspired artists they were.    The account of the early years made me feel a part of the birth of Creepy and Eerie, and the ultimate downfall of Warren Publishing was a mind-blower.  The whole story is told in the form of interviews, with priceless preliminary sketches and rare photos of the artists and writers.  It was like re-examining an important part of my childhood from an adult perspective.  Also contains a handy checklist of the contents of each issue of Famous Monsters, Creepy, Eerie and Vampirella.  Most of all I admire the restraint and good judgement of interviewer Jon Cooke.	2003-08-13

It's like selling your portfolio, and a sign that you've &quot;made it&quot; to a certain level in your field.  Joe Chiodo is good, especially at a certain kind of stylized girlie art that is real streamlined '50s style, with cool lava-lamp color combinations, similar to what Bill Wray is doing, and somewhat derived from Hanna-Barbera animation design of the '60s, and heavily influenced by Robert McGinness' crime detective femme fatale paperback book covers of the same era.  The subject range in this book is not as great as on his website.  Sometimes the girls' heads are too big.  Is he any relation to the Chiodo brothers of &quot;Killer Klown&quot; fame?  If you are into animation/motion picture design, you should take a look at your competition in this book.  It's a fairly slim volumn, and it's not earthshaking (as Frazetta's work was) but the guy fills me with envy for his design ability.	2003-08-11

If a student showed me this work, I'd encourage him to keep going in the hope that he might eventually find his own style.  He once did a Famous Monsters of Filmland cover that wasn't too bad, because he was copying from  photographs.

The guy does some nice color studies, kind of analytically.  I suspect he works from photos because a lot of the paintings have a traced look (but with, as I said, very studiously scientific color transitions), and the one charcoal drawing from life they print is downright awful (terrible proportions and no volumn).  He's obviously imitating Sorolla, a contemporary of Sargent's who is really good, even to the kids on the beach subject matter.  Sorolla's scenes look real, Asaro's look artificial, mainly due to the over-saturated candy colors, but there is also a contrived, impersonal quality to the work, as though he is demonstrating color theory.  Most painters have a copy of this book on their shelves, though, and Asaro is considered instructive.	2003-07-28

The book is no disappointment; the reproductions are large and sensitive to color nuances, on heavy paper, and there are a lot of them.  There are short essays by Silverman about each painting which show an honest, contemplative mind at work.  It's not a how-to book; there's no pedantic bloviating, just a humble, intelligent man describing the circumstances behind each picture.  At first I pegged Silverman as one of those East Coast types who paint their Greenwich Village friends sitting still with expressionless faces and vacant stares.  It all seemed too academic, lacking action and vigor, like most modern art.  But his understanding of color and composition is undeniable, and the personalities he depicts grow on you.  They are of the type of person who can be found in artist's lofts, in front of Folger's coffee cans full of paintbrushes, wearing sweaters and spectacles, New York academics and intellectuals who go to poetry readings, listen to Public Radio, and fret about the fate of the Rosenbergs. He's a world traveller, so he has other types of people, too, but he seems to know all of them personally, and doesn't just paint anonymous models.  Though his work is a little tame compared to the kind of entertainment industry stuff I'm interested in, commercial illustrators could learn a lot from Silverman's penetrating eye and calm, balanced judgement.	2003-07-13

You should buy them instead of this overpriced collection of Mignola art.  The very thing that makes Hellboy so beautiful, the simplicity and elegance of design, means that looking at a Mignola sketch is exactly like looking at a finished comic book panel, except you can see the India ink brush marks in the black areas, and there is no supporting narrative thrust to give the picture meaning.  The same goes for his pencils (of which there are few included- I don't think this guy makes a mark on paper without inking and publishing it).  There is not even a discussion of Mignola's sources or inspirations, no bibliography of the occult (oh, I forgot, we're living in post-literate America).  There is no insight to be gained by investing in the Art of Hellboy, because it is just a sampler of beautifully designed panels that look better in the comic books.	2003-07-04

Though she probably didn't actually write a single word herself, she did believe the raunchy outrageousness propounded herein, and it was liberating for a nation bound by puritanism. If interested, read Ordeal, which Lovelace \\"wrote\\"  (with Gloria Steinem) in the '80s, claiming she was but a helpless victim \\"forced\\" into porn.  The truth is she was an opportunist who went whichever way the wind seemed to be blowing, and after her heavy drinking and weight gain made her unemployable in porn she decided to cash in on the feminist anti-exploitation crusade.  When  even feminists eventually accepted porn as a form of personal freedom, her only supporters were in the Religious Right.  But there wasn't any money to be made with the Fundementalists, as she didn't have the innocent, tarnished angel look that might hook them:  she was a haggard, boozed-up woman from the poor side of town, making her way on her own after fame had deserted her.  As porn became an accepted part of the American economy in the 90's, she got back into the field as a promoter and pitchwoman for X-rated products.  She had to make a living after all, and she was still a celebrity, however faded.  Then she died suddenly in a car wreck, and that was the end of her weird trip through America's sex, sin and censorship struggle. If you are excited by perverted sleaze, Ordeal is the more satisfying book (both as a moralistic primal scream and as sadistic voyeurism).  Inside Linda Lovelace is too matter of fact, like a Playboy interview with a member of the '60s counter-culture who is trying to shock the straights.  Deep Throat, her notorious smut flick, for a while attained the status of endearing testament to an age of comparative innocence (though it is now forgotten to all but a few nostalgic intellectuals). While modern porn stars make six- and seven-figure incomes, Linda ended up with nothing.  She was basically a good person, not smart but certainly fascinating, and I feel sorry that she suffered just so that we could all buy legal porn on the Internet.	2003-05-25

With examples of various genres, including both ink and pencil drawings, this slim volume doesn't really have his best stuff.  Woody's work has a slightly stiff and old-fashioned quality, but if you're interested in illustration or science fiction (especially of the 1950's), this is passable.  A lot of weird and absurd images, obsessively rendered.   I was struck by the long hours he must have put in.  The bio describes the sad end of his life. For better examples of Wood's cartooning, get reprints of '50s era Mad magazines.  For his classic sci-fi illustrations, \\"Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood\\" has more to offer than this book, but it's much more expensive.	2003-05-05

The drawings are too loose and sketchy to see clearly what he is describing.  He goes through the seven typs of folds all right, but they need to be illustrated more three dimensionally. I'd choose this over Hogarth's book, though, because Bridgeman's written descriptions are to the point, and at least the drawings aren't overdone.  And it's [inexpensive].  The world cries out for the definitive book on drapery: one that is concise, accurate, and with good drawings.  I saw one once on a guy's desk in an animation studio, it looked like it was written in the '50s, but I can't remember the name; it had superbly elegant drawings and lean, no-nonsense explanations of the 7 folds.  I made some copies, but not of the title.  Oh well, Bridgeman will have to do.	2003-04-12

And his paintings look great- the epitome of a sort of smooth and buttery '50s illustrational style, like Haddon Sundblom, but tighter- very disciplined and technically acccomplished, yet lyrical. Any objections to Sanden's seeming promotion of his \\"Pro-Mix\\" brand of paints are unfounded (that's where you order a box of pre-mixed colors made by a company which has a deal with the author). He tells you exactly how to mix the colors yourself out of the usual tubes of paint you can buy in any art store, so you can either order them pre-mixed, or do it yourself, so where's the problem? The delight of this book is looking at the step by step demonstrations of all those juicy, painterly pictures of people with lots of personality. His two hour sketches are beauties (more \\"artistic\\" than his finished commissions). I got a lot out of the book, most of which is the wisdom of the ages anyway, but stated in a no-nonsense fashion (maybe a little dogmatic in a few instances, but the guy does a certain style and he has his game down pat, so just pick what you need). Sanden's work is aimed at the tastes of those who have become CEOs, Church leaders, and heads of State, and is frankly corny (unless, like me, you are so modern you get off on that) but his revealing demos really explain the dazzling virtuosity. If you're serious about painting heads, this belongs on your shelf. In and of itself, it won't teach you to paint, but what will?	2003-04-06

He was one of their top artists, along with Frank Frazetta, Jack Davis, Al Williamson, Reed Crandall, and Angelo Torres.  Some of Morrow's drawings and paintings from that era are reprinted here as well as much other work I had not seen.  He was a better (and more versatile) artist than I realized, since his paintings for Creepy were not quite as powerful as Frazetta's at the time, but his career evidently took many turns, and he did a wide variety of work for comic, movies and advertising, eventually developing a polished, assured flair for snazzy, hip, dynamic renditions of pulp themes: spies, detectives, spacemen, cowboys, glamor girls, horror, fantasy and adventure.  Large, vibrant color reproductions, interesting biographical info on the man and his contemporaries in '60s New York, make this book desirable for nostalgic baby boomers as well as aspiring commercial artists who want to gaze at great technique.

After a so-so start with Bill Everett and Joe Orlando (inked by Vince Colletta), Wally Wood takes over with his eccentric, disciplined, almost scientific approach to illustrating castles, weird inventions and other gee-whiz stuff.  Then John Romita brings his muscular, vibrant, dynamic and organic compositions to the title, and it really comes alive (his work looks exactly like the bright, catchy, somewhat &quot;cartoony&quot; classics Romita did for Spiderman as that character's best artist).  Next comes Gene Colan, who's facile virtuosity, flowing figures, and unique camera angles became the definitive Daredevil &quot;look&quot; that originally caught my young eyes back in the '60s.  Stan Lee's trademaked psuedo-hip wisecracking and underlying decency bring nostalgic warmth and amusement to my heart.  Though the art has never been equaled and looks strong in black and white, this series of reprints should be in color!  And not the phony computor color they're using nowadays with the little airbrushed-looking highlights, but just plain old ordinary flat comic book color like they had in the ones my mother threw out.	2003-03-10
