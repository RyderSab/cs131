I wish I had been smart enough to look for a book like this in 1990, when I began to take cooking seriously.  <br />Now that I've got a small library of  cookbooks (30+), I tend to rate cookbooks' usefulness on two criteria: the  writing and the instructions.  This one should be read for both.  The  Introduction and First Steps in Cooking alone are worth the price of the  book.<br />I've now realized that the best cookbooks are those that convey to  the reader that cooking is really a simple undertaking.  Some recipes  simply take more muscle or thought, but fundamentally, it's just cooking  and cooking well is about organization, understanding food, and community.   That is, you don't just cook for yourself; you cook for others, too, so you  might as well learn how to do it confidently.<br />Claiborne shows you that  cooking is just cooking and you can still produce food that tastes good.   He never talks down to you.  His instruction is that of a relaxed teacher,  someone who seems to assume that you've been too busy to focus on other  things to learn how to cook.  Therefore, his tone IMHO is that of a person  who understands the reader is intelligent but just hasn't had the time or  inclination to cook.  The novice and the expert will learn from this little  gem.	1999-12-13

It's well organized and the writing is light and informative.<br />However, I am a little dismayed at the  author's definition of Lounge.  Why is it that Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock,  and Dizzy Gillespie are lounge, and yet Sonny Rollins, Lester Young, and  Jimmy Smith are not?  For example, Lester Young influenced Stan Getz and  yet, the former is not included in this volume.  And Charlie Parker, who is  a little difficult musically, is also in this book?  I don't get it.	1999-12-13

The knowledge Child imparts took me to another level of understanding good food and good cooking.<br />I don't  consider myself a gourmet.  I am a good home cook who appreciates  delicious, hearty food and I gravitate towards these types of dishes and  chefs.  By the time I read The Way to Cook, I'd already owned and read  three or four cookbooks (all from the Silver Palate ladies) and I didn't  learn about the process and intellectual thought of cooking until Child.   Wow.  She truly brings everything to its most basic point and then, tell  you how to treat the food.  Additionally, the book is organized well;  written in a straightforward manner; and the recipes are simple to follow  and delicious to eat.<br />True, this is more continental than it is American,  but I think if you could only have two or three cookbooks, this would be  one of them.  The others would be Cook's Bible and Joy of Cooking (new  ed).<br />One warning, like most cookbooks, the food is rich, so if you're on  a diet, eat breakfast, make this for lunch or an early dinner and don't eat  anything the rest of the day!	1999-12-09

This was the cookbook I learned to cook from.  How silly was I?  I spent nearly two years learning about food from this volume and the Silver Palate series, and if I had to do it  all over again, I would have begun my journey with the Joy of Cooking or  the Fannie Farmer Cookbook.  While I learned a lot about food and  entertaining, these books require a certain degree of knowledge.  It's like  going into Calc II without taking Pre-Calc and Calc I.<br />The recipes make  for good food, and it's great for dinner parties and large gatherings,  since the attendants truly enjoy the end results.  However, the method is  time consuming and not for the faint of heart.<br />All that said, going from  this cookbook to the Cook's Illustrated series, The Way to Cook, Joy of  Cooking, and all the fancy restaurant cookbooks (some of them VERY good!)  was an ABSOLUTE BREEZE!  Now, I don't even refer to New Basics too often  since if I want an explanation of something, I go to Joy and if I want  something fancy but not frivolous, I read Cook's, Alfred Portale, or Julia  Child.<br />I tend to use this book for summer and fall parties, when I have  more time and inclination to find the ingredients.	1999-12-09

The various personalities in religion; aspects of life within the Benedictine  church; and a variety of small, beautiful critical thinking essays on the  meanings of icons and values are some of the topics Norris explores in her  chapters.<br />Overall, they are thought-provoking and reveal a person who is  more than a visitor to the ways of the Benedictine.<br />I only gave four  stars, since I found her writing style a bit distracting and the  organization of the book not exactly conducive to easy reading.  It's true  that each chapter is a handful, but the editor might have done Norris a  favor by facilitating the outline of the book.	1999-12-09

It was first written when people who cooked automatically knew basic terms.  Therefore, the recipes are straightforward and not ostentatious.  Claiborne also assumes a  certain amount of confidence that the reader has, so his writing style  doesn't make the home cook feel stupid or uninformed.<br />Even if you already  have three or four cookbooks you regularly use as your bible, buy this one  for the value of understanding where the American gastronomic movement came  from.  It was pushed forth partially by Claiborne.	1999-12-09

It's got solid recipes that are useful for the beginner.<br />That said, if you prefer a  reference with more charm, more insightful writing, and better recipes,  this Joy doesn't add up.  It doesn't inform the reader about the current  lifestyle that previous editions did.  This one is more antiseptic.  I'm  not sure if that reflects the time we live in or the various writers'  vision of the late 90s.  In any case, this edition is great for a novice  and has a place in all kitchens.	1999-12-07

I can't say enough good things about this book.  Kimball tells you in precise detail what does and does not work.  He and his staff do all the necessary research to let the reader know why a recipe turns out well.  And  his book reads like a conversation.<br />If you are one of those cooks who  wants to understand food then this book and the whole Cook's Illustrated  volumes are for you.  They will tell you how to do their dishes and give  you the intellectual background to understand the process.  I hate to use  such highbrow words for Kimball's downhome style, but this certainly ought  to be part of the American gastronomic tradition.<br />By the way, did I  mention that the food turns out fabulously?	1999-12-07

Okay, so far, I'm the only one who's given less than 5 stars on this book and I feel fairly alone as a dissenting voice.  However, I've got a sizeable collection of cookbooks (30+) and this is one of the least opened.   Why?  Certainly not because of the recipes.  They taste just fine.  It  just doesn't have the same zip as some of the newer cookbooks which have  equal content but their presentation is much better, IMHO.<br />I really wish  I could give this book more stars, but maybe Mr. Pepin needs to do some  updating of his material in this particular work.

The bum  didn't even footnote this book and he also didn't even give American wines  a break.  I would complain, but for $30 we got a two hour wine tasting and  a fabulous dinner that lasted well into midnight!  At least he matched  wonderful wine to even better food.

I felt there was something missing in all the television reports, and Kaplan's book certainly seems to be the  answer.  In an entertaining way, he tracks the birth and evolution of what  seems to be an otherworldly movement.  As someone who was in the banking  industry as a junior analyst in the late 80s and left after two years, I  wanted to see if the Valley and Manhattan were similar.  Yes but no.   Silicon Valley is even more sick.  Wall Street has your typical greed, but  it's nothing compared to the phenomenon out West as chronicled by Kaplan.   What are they doing with all that money?  I'm not sure why everyone loves  to hate Bill Gates; at least he's doing something positive with his wealth  these days.  As I suspected and Kaplan confirms, there is no soul in this  industry.

I agree with the reader from Boston that the women Roth picked were on the shallow side.  If she had chosen women from Seattle,  Chicago, and Boston, I think this book would have had a different flavor.   Notwithstanding, the same emotions reverberate for any modern woman.  It's  a lot of anxiety and angst over whether one is EVER going to meet the right  person or better yet, whether one is READY to meet the right person.   There's more ambivalence out there than the general population realizes.   Today's modern woman has a lot of options and sometimes those all get  skewed.

For  light reading of this genre, try Elinor Lipman, Lorrie Moore.  Some good  books are Jackie by Josie, Mail, Was it Something I Said, or Cupid and  Diana.

Sorry, but I can recommend at least three books of short stories  most recent collection, and Judith Budnitz's Flying Leap.
