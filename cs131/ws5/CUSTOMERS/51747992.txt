His three rowdy sons need to settle down, and he lays down a challenge.  The first one to marry AND produce a grandchild, boy or girl, will inherit the majority of the Triple M ranch.  The young men are stunned, angry, and each is determined to be the winner of this &quot;contest.&quot;  Rafe, the eldest, feels Angus's decision is unfair.  To lose his inherited right to head up the ranch's operation would tear him apart.  So he reluctantly gives up his freedonm and sends off for a mail order bride.<br />Emmeline Harding can't hold her liquor.  She doesn't find this out until after she wakes up in her aunt's brothel with a pile of gold coins on the nightstand beside her bed.  Fearing the worst, Emmeline flees town as a mail-order bride.  But will she have to confess her dubious past to her unseen husband?<br />A wonderful tale begins right from the start of this novel.  Each character, including the secondary characters, is well drawn.  The plot is believable and keeps the pages turning.  The only thing I would have liked to see is more of Rafe!  It is a little weighted on the inner conflict of Emmeline.  Otherwise, a great read!	2003-02-11

I am an avid lover of history, and the hint of paranormal in the bookjacket description intrigued me.  I didn't even get mildly into the book until over halfway through; up to that point, I felt the Steven really didn't give me a whole lot of reason to feel sorry for him, or empathize, unless I count his mean wife.  Too much monotonous description in the first part of the book for my taste, the action in the plot started way too late.  If the author was trying to do this for effect, to make us feel what Steven felt it wasn't effective.  And there wasn't any resolution with the wife; that is left up to the reader's imagination.  It was a loose end most readers would like to see wrapped up.  But I can't justify the character's mid-life crisis actions the same way the author did.  Then the ending was wrapped up way too quickly.  The light bulb went off in the character's head, then it was over.  Huh.  <br />That the author has talent, I have to doubt.  He doesn't apply it very well in this work. <br />The ONLY reason I finished this book was because I paid so much for it.  If it had presented the story that was on the jacket, I would have loved it.  As it is, it's a disappointment.	2002-08-31

It tries to have an element of romance-- or does the Nanny just want a romp in the hay?  What was the deal with her Dad and the school?  Where did THAT come from?  And the ending is so depressing. Sorry, I just didn't feel any empathy with the Nanny at all. She should have listened to her mother.  Seems like Nanny wanted the prestige of being a nanny to Somebody, was after the great money.  After all, what else was the payoff for her to stay in the position?  The only thing we seemed to have in common was the pity for the child. But she stayed so long, she let the kid come to love her, when she knew she'd be out on her ear sooner or later.<br />Now, where did the hilarious part of it come in?  <br />But the PR firm and agent did a good job.  I was suckered.	2002-08-24

Confronting his dad and returning to<BR>Pecan Grove, Texas are not on the top of the list of fun things to do,<BR>but J.T. knows he'd better or Pop and his antics might end up being<BR>fodder for another humiliating incident.  You'd think he'd be impervious<BR>to embarassment after growing up with an absent-minded, hippie-scientest<BR>as a parent.  But he wasn't.  J.T. didn't want to be disappointed again<BR>by the man he was supposed to look up to.  He waits in a rainstorm for<BR>the lights in Pop's house to go out, then sneaks into his father's home<BR>laboratory to search for the latest oddball gimmick.  He is caught and<BR>stumbles into a strange contraption that not only shocks him to his<BR>socks, but makes him invisible!<br />Roselyn Peabody, Pop's smart and unusually attractive assistant tends to<BR>J.T. and he soon wakes from his stupor.  Her touch is electrifying, and<BR>it isn't just the results of his condition.  He sees unwelcome<BR>characteristics that she shares with his father as far as her strange<BR>fascination with science, yet he is drawn to her.<br />Rosy promised to help him regain his visibility, but wonders if his<BR>seductive maneuvers are only because she is the only one who can help<BR>his father recover the information needed to help return J.T. to<BR>normal.

That's how she viewed her <BR>banishment to the hot, dusty Texas Panhandle.  Her father decided the spoiled  <BR>beauty needed some lessons in real life, so he sent her to Langtry, Texas to join a <BR>family friend's school and instruct young ladies in manners and deportment, and she <BR>wasn't to return home until she'd earned her own passage.  What Lilla finds is a lot <BR>of cactus, a lot of dirt, and a lack of students.  And the devastatingly handsome <BR>Grady Finch, foreman of the WC ranch.  That man was definitely in need of a <BR>lesson in manners, because he was decidedly lacking in tact and respect.  Yet <BR>underneath his gruffness, he definitely had a soft heart.  She couldn't help wondering <BR>what it would be like to win the love of a man like Grady.  Could she prove to him <BR>that she could survive on her own, and that she wasn't the prissy snob he thought <BR>she was?<br />Grady Finch didn't have any use for the likes of Lilla.  Well, he could think of <BR>one or two, but it was out of the question.  The hothouse beauty would never make <BR>it in Texas, she was too fragile, and didn't have the temperament.  Or did she?  As <BR>the wonderfully willful woman showed her true colors, he couldn't help being drawn <BR>to her.  But he could never provide for her in the way she'd grown up accustomed <BR>to.  Better to keep his distance.  Too bad his heart disagreed.  How would he ever <BR>win the battle to keep his hands off?  Did he even really want to try?<br />Once again, Ronda Thompson draws readers in to enjoy a story full of <BR>well-rounded characters and interesting conflicts.  It is neat to see how Grady and <BR>Lilla grow and change.  I thought the transition with Lilla was a little fast for the <BR>character she started out to be, but I did like her really well.  The chemistry <BR>between Lilla and Grady is hot, and the tension is played out very well.  A cast of <BR>secondary characters enhances the story, and leaves you wondering who the next <BR>book will be about. All in all, the story is worth losing sleep over!	2001-12-01

It covers the various subgenres of romance as well, including African American, Time Travel,                              Christian, Mulit-Cultural, Romantic Suspense and more.<br />          Even though not every essay will be agreeable to every writer, and there are a lot of essays to pick and                     choose from,  I would recommend this to ALL writers in the Romance genre.	2001-03-25

After all, just because Lila is a madam in the town's whorehouse doesn't mean Cass is a woman of loose           morals.  So when, after a fracas, Lila is given the choice of a jail cell or exile, Cass formulates a plan that           will help them start a new life.  The plan is a sound one in her mind, but she never counted on the sparks           that would fly when they joined up with a group of straight-laced church-goers on a wagon train headed           West.  She also never counted on feeling the stirrings of desire for the preacher with angelic good looks           and mischievous eyes either.  Did she have more in common with her sister and the crew of soiled doves                                 thatn she thought?  Or could this be true love?<br />            Nathan Stone was a big believer in second chances.  Why else would fate have saved him from a             hangman's noose and into the assumed identity of the preacher who was supposed to be leading this          groups of religious folks across the country?    Determined to make good on his new life, Nathan gets into            the role of spiritual leader with zeal.  But then the beautiful Cassidy McAllister and her troup of &quot;ladies&quot;            join the train, and Nathan is tempted by the lovely woman's seeming  innocence and seductive charm.            Why couldn't he believe Cass, obviously a lady of questionable virtue, have the same second chance he                       himself sought?  Furthermore, why couldn't they start a new life together?<br />              But soon Nathan's past threatens to rear it's ugly head.  How can their tender love survive the web of                                        lies and misunderstandings?<br />        I was intrigued by the concept of this book.  This leans more toward an &quot;ensemble cast&quot; type story, as the             lovely secondary characters, who are well-drawn, totally overshadow the story between Cass and           Nathan.  The time the hero and heroine do spend together is mostly spent fighting.  I wanted to see more            actually happening with them, by themselves.  Ms. Carmichael has a quick wit and capacity to catch a            reader's interest with great personalities.  The story, while still a worthwhile read, would be stronger if                   more time was spent on Nathan and Cass working together to solve their conflict.	2001-03-22

The characters are so well-drawn, and the chemistry           between Aubrey and Susannah is enticing.  Throughout this story, though, I feel the external conflict never          really reached it's potential.  Too many things were heaped on to a particular secondary character, and the           reasoning behind why Julia, the dead wife, did what she did was weak.  The ending seemed rushed.  But,          the pull between Aubrey and Susannah is enough for me to give this one a high reccomendation, despite the                                         earler mentioned points.	2001-03-22

Not only would he be aiding his recently widowed sister, but he would have a chance to          forget a failed relationship.  One in which his fiancée had tried to change him.  He knew he was not dashing,          but he wasn't the dullest knife in the drawer.  Perhaps he might be a bit set in his ways . . . Maybe he could          use a little more excitement. He gets more than he bargained for when he encounters his attractive next door           neighbor.  He could do without her prickly nature, and that little dog too. Until he found an alternative, he              would have to settle for the vicarious adventures in the western novels he'd recently discovered.   <br />        Robin Wise is less than impressed by her new neighbor-- and his little devil-cat.  The feline taunts her dog,          and its stuffy owner has the gall to blame her pup for the squabbles.  At a second glance, Alex isn't quite as          nerdy as he seems.  As a matter of fact, when he isn't insulting her dog, he can be quite charming. She didn't         need charming.  She has her own problems.  Such as the inherited curse looming over her impending thirtieth           birthday.  Until Robin can overcome the hex, she can't indulge in any fantasy she might have regarding the            more-perfect-by-the-minute professor.

Finding out he's a father and only has six months to marry and prove himself fit to undertake guardianship of the six-year-old daughter puts him in a quandary.  The only one he would ever  consider is the woman he is in love with - - Alewine Jones, his best  friend.  The problem is Aly is stubborn, her pride almost bigger than her  mouth, and she has no interest in marrying him.  The only way she would  accept his proposal would be if she were obligated by honor.  So Nick  arranges a poker game with the intention of gaining a wife as the  prize.<br />Aly always kept a promise.  So when Nick named his price after the  suspicious poker game, Aly reluctantly agreed.  Very reluctantly.  The  outspoken lady freighter had quite a few words to say about it.  Used to  doing things the way she wanted and when she wanted, she had no interest in  being hog-tied, even to her best fishing partner.  Besides, when she was  around him she turned mushy inside, and when he turned his attentions on  her full-force she knew her heart was in danger.  How could he really want  her, when she had no notion of how to be a proper female?<br />Can Nick  convince Aly he needs her forever?  Will Aly learn to trust her woman's  heart?<br />Move over Calamity Jane!  Ms. Hunter captures a reader's attention  with a tight plot and original characters. Nick's utterly charming manner  and Aly's underlying vulnerability cause the reader to really root for the  relationship.  The subplot of the relationship between Nick's daughter and  her mother is wonderfully complex.	2000-06-05

Worth paper, with the terms being he helps her raise enough money to go back east, and he gets the farm.  But he can't be good-looking.  She'd had her fill of the distrustful schemes good-looking men employed.  When Jake Winslow takes her up on her offer, she goes against her better judgement and agrees to the marriage out of desperation. <br /> Jake Winslow had expected more of a place when he answered the woman's ad, and he darn sure never expected a built -in family.  Ready to ride on, he changes his mind when confronted with the enormity of challenges facing this beautiful, determined woman who was definitely more than met the eye.  Besides, he needed to disappear, and this wide spot in the road was a seemingly easy place to do so.  He would fulfill his part of the bargain, and once the Matlands moved out, he'd continue his plan to live a solitary life.<br /> Neither Loreen nor Jake counts on falling in love.  But as their feelings grow, each feels trapped tighter in their respective pasts.  Both wonder if second chances are possible.  Would their love survive once truths are revealed?<br /> This story is heartwarming.  The characters are vivid, and their growth is seen readily throughout the novel. At first the reader is led to believe Loreen is too soft on her brother, but as the story progresses she handles him well as her confidence grows. The subtle parallel brought forth in the plot between Loreen and a creature that comes into their care that has been mistreated is handled deftly.  Jake's courage is to be admired, besides, he sounds scrumptious!  END	2000-05-30

Ginny Thornton is in the midst of preparations for her New Year's Eve Ball to celebrate the turn of the century.  But instead of the festive occasion it should be, it is overshadowed by doubt  and insecurity.  Ginny is troubled by her husband's recent behavior, and  his reluctance to discuss matters concerning their estate frustrates her.   When he takes his own life, Ginny is devastated and learns he's lost her  precious family home, Malmaison, due to an unscrupulous business deal with  a man named Sutter.  Seeking escape, Ginny takes refuge in her  conservatory, where she falls asleep...and when she wakes, she discovers  she is one hundred years in the future.<br />In 1999, Dr. Samuel Sutter is in  charge of Malmaison.  He is less interested in the aspects of the Victorian  mansion's past than he is in the future of the organic research the  conservatory provides.  But he has promised his mother to continue with the  New Year's Eve ball, designed to celebrate the new millenium.  When he  discovers Ginny, he mistakenly believes she is the new curator of the  estate and enlists her aid to make sure everything is as it was at  Malmaison in 1899.<br />Ginny readily takes advantage of the situation in  hopes to find a way to restore her home to her and go back to her own time.  What she discovers is shocking, and so is her attraction to Sam.  <br />Ms.  Hix paints a beautiful picture of Victorian life in this intriguing story.   The chemistry between Sam and Ginny is well done, and her secondary  characters have spark.  The only weak point came later in the book with the  reverse time-travel et cetera.  I found the device a bit vague.  But then  again, so is time-travel all together, right? *g*  Otherwise it is  gripping.<br />April Redmon 5/29/00	2000-05-29

So, you should know I had  an eye on this book and was ready for any kind of bias either way on this  story about one of country music's most revolutionary members.<br />Ms.  Sgammato is a woman with connections into the industry, and her research is  extensive and thorough. She pulls no punches, and puts the good in with the  not so perfect to give a well-rounded picture of the man and the performer.  This book goes a long way to dispel or confirm various myths about Garth  Brooks. It gives a rare insight into the man who dared not only to follow a  dream, but also to fight to maintain control of that dream in the face of  fickle critics and those who might be jealous of his success.<br />She speaks  of the hardships GB faced as an ordinary Midwestern guy trying to find  himself, and his, as well as his wife's, struggle to build a career in a  tough to get into industry. Then it outlines their struggle to handle the  fame notoriety that came with phenomenal success.<br />Along with GB's story,  there are various referrals to those in the history of the country music  industry, as well as examples of the generosity of others, that inspire not  only Garth Brooks, but many others as well.<br />Overall, this is a great  story about a good man, who started out just like anyone else and worked to  make his dreams come true.

Soon, a messenger appears with a note explaining that her child has  been mistakenly delivered to            Victorian England by a confused  stork in his dotage.  Along with the distressing news, she is given a  &quot;ticket&quot; to            the past, which she uses with desperate  haste so she can reclaim her child.  She finds more than motherly love             when she arrives in the past, she also finds Matthew Weymouth, a man  who could use a little magic in his life            himself.  <br />            Ms. Riley delivers an interesting tale.  Everyone who loves regency loves a  reformed rogue, and that is what            Matthew Weymouth becomes.  Emma  is a little silly, in my opinion, but she does deliver some nice  one-liners!  <br />           Blame it on the Baby by Jennifer Archer  <br />            How many of you who have been pregnant wished that, just for awhile,  that your partner could experience it first            hand?

He gets to have one            job--managing a restaurant--while  she is a college student, part-time law clerk and full time wife and mother  to            their daughter with another child on the way.

He realizes what she  deals with day to            day, but Tory also comes to realize that  Dillon's life isn't all she thought it was either.  <br />           Ms.  Archer tells a story with a strong moral, while giving us some laugh out  loud reading!  The unique style is one            to look for in the  future.  At first I thought Dillon's reaction was a little hysterical, but  upon reflection, I believe            this is more than likely how a guy  would react to the situation.  The fantasy of having your mate fill your  shoes            and actually understand things from your point of view is  wonderful!

The prototype for  the new Miss Kiss doll ensures it.             Only...her world is turned  upside down when her Granny Gigi weaves a spell that turns the doll into a  flesh and            blood baby!

The one night of passion they had            shared weeks earlier  had ruined him for other women, and he intended to make Sam see the light  one way or            another.  <br />           Ms. Ray's story is magical  and charming, not to mention steamy!  The chemistry between Jake and  Samantha            keep the reader turning the pages.  Granny Gigi is a  loveable nut.	2000-05-23

Through               this bizarre, intriguing episode, can Lisa and  Michael find each other again?  <br />              In her debut novel, Ms.  Archer weaves a humorous and touching tale that touches on issues that  almost               everyone experiences in a long-term relationship.   Several times I found myself laughing out loud!  By                incorporating these issues, she allows the readers to identify with her  characters, drawing them into the               fantasy completely.  <br />               The twist on Tory's side of it was something I didn't expect,  however, and wanted to see her point of view in               the story.  I  was thrilled with her observations when she first found herself in Lisa's  body, and the way her               character was handled was an integral  part of the story.  But as a reader, I still wanted to see her point of                view.  Luckily, we see more of Tory in Blame It On The Baby,  Jennifer Archer's story in the New Year's               Babies Anthology by  Leisure (Nov.99 ISBN 0-505-52345-0  <br />              Rediscovering love is  almost, if not more important sometimes, than finding it for the first  time.  This what we               learn through great entertainment in Body  and Soul.  Way to go!	2000-05-23

Ronda Thompson gives us a sensual tale with a gripping plot driven by strong characters.<br />Camile Cordell had something to prove.

However, Wade is  as determined as she is to accomplish his goal, and when these two clash  sparks fly!<br />This is a very well written story that grips the reader's  attention.   The only place I drifted was a section toward the end where  the events between Wade and Camile were  summarized in detail...this part  might have been better served if shortened a bit.  Otherwise, I wouldn't  trade a thing, it's a definite keeper!<br />April Redmon  12/2/99	1999-12-03
