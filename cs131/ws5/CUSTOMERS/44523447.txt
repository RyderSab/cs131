Whether he's going metaphorical, or descriptive, or setting you up to belly punch you with a zinger, this author has talent and a way with words that made my head spin.  And Tropper's very witty, very moving, very effective prose is on full-scale display with his wonderful novel, THE BOOK OF JOE.<br /><br />Joe Goffman fled the very turbulent times of his teenage life in a small Connecticut town, then got even by writing a novel that bashed anyone and everyone for all the chaos and mayhem he experienced.  To Joe's complete surprise, the novel became a runaway bestseller, than a major motion picture.  But here's the problem:  His father suffers a stroke, and slips into a coma; Joe goes back, after seventeen years, to his hometown, and suddenly he is face-to-face with the very people he disparaged.  From an estranged older brother, to a former high school bully still determined to torment, to a grizzled old basketball coach still an icon in town, to an old sweetheart whose heart remains broken, Joe grapples with the ghosts of his past, and comes to a realization that maybe the problem with his little hometown rests within himself--and not its residents.<br /><br />This is a magnificent read, from its flowing prose to its compelling and definitive flashbacks of Joe's last year in Bush Falls High School. . .of his trials and tribulations with the three most important people in his life:  Carly, Wayne, and Sammy.  Tropper has absolutely triumphed in his ability to elicit the full gambit of emotions in the reader; I found myself laughing one moment, then wiping away a tear the next.  The ending of this novel is incredibly poignant; Tropper creates and builds such an atmosphere the reader is completely absorbed, and overwhelmed with raw emotion.  I see that Warner Brothers is developing THE BOOK OF JOE into a movie, and I can't wait.  If they are able to reproduce even a fraction of the spirit of Tropper's book, the movie will be a blockbuster.<br /><br />--D.

The various characters were flawed (as are all characters), and their subsequent interactions and conflict mundane, yet I still remained transfixed as I turned each page.  Let's see:  a singing ensemble, an insecure anthropologist, and two tiny twins above the Artic Circle. . .none of the above really interests me.  Yet Michel Faber's amazing gift with the written word made his three-novella collection, named THE COURAGE CONSORT, an absolutely spellbinding, mystical, existential, and satisfying reading experience.<br /><br />The \\"Guardian\\" of London says of Faber:  \\"This is a man who could give Conrad a run at writing the perfect sentence.\\"  Darn right.  Faber's writing is clean, concise, compelling--a fluid nirvana of perfectly-matched nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions.  The prose is nothing short of brilliant:  the author manipulates the English language like a sorcerer waving an hpynotic wand.  The result:  reading that rolls off the tip of the tongue, like sampling a wine of inestimable value.<br /><br />Faber is good, very good; this novella collection is positively as riveting as his post-Victorian masterpiece, \\"The Crimson Petal And The White.\\"  As a matter of fact, Faber has demonstrated, via his surreal prose, that he has grown even more as a writer--which makes reading him the epitome of literary pleasure.<br />--D.

What, you may ask, is a \\"fictoid?\\"  Well, as author and fellow Okie Bill Dutcher explains, a fictoid is a fictional factoid, and Dutcher provides a delightful plethora of them in his fun book entitled (of course) FICTOIDS.  As an example:<br /><br />\\"Since 1994, commuters entering Manhattan in car pools have been required to use bridges instead of tunnels, due to rising health concerns over car pool tunnel syndrome.\\"<br /><br />Hey, that's funny, I don't care who you are!  Dutcher gives us a history of fictoids, going all the way back to 1224 BC.  Most are witty, a few rather lame, but all of them entertain.  And Dutcher, a former journalist, can sure manipulate the English language with some outstanding adjectives (for example, \\"Pugnacious Palooka, the pusillanimous pugilist\\"), which makes the book a fun read in and of itself.  FICTOIDS is guaranteed to prompt a smile or two, along with some well-deserved giggles.<br /><br />--D. Mikels	2005-06-05

The novel even spawned a movie or two.  So why did I finish HELL HOUSE and yawn, nonchalantly scratch my groin, and wish I could have several hours of my life back?<br /><br />Could it be, perhaps, that the story was contrived, often even laughable?  That the characterization was weak?  That the story contained a \\"mystery of Hell House\\" that really wasn't a mystery at all?  That the author's sexual jollies added nothing to the plot whatsoever?  That the ending, which took forever and a day to arrive, was as weak as a popcorn burp?<br /><br />Yes to all of the above.<br /><br />Even worse was Matheson's writing style, which had me squirming with its weak word selection (often redundant, with the same words in the same sentence) and obscene reliance on awkward adverbs.  Confusedly?  Frightenedly?  Frenziedly?  What the heck(ly)?  I kept wondering if I was reading a novel or a mediocre effort from some college kid submitting a classroom assignement.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this book, as I bought into the hype that HELL HOUSE was one of Matheson's \\"signature\\" works.  If this is a signature work, Matheson needs to go back to penmanship class.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />--D. Mikels	2005-05-30
US	44523447	R2Z8EDI93PVCAU	1569470545	56387718	Hippopotamus	Books	5	14	14	N	N	Deliciously Wicked	\\"There's none so evil-minded as those with a moral mission, and none so pure in heart as the depraved.\\"  Those words, spoken by curmudgeonly, ribald, rabble-rousing Ted Wallace, aptly summarize the philosophy of this most entertaining read.  And blustery, hard-drinking Ted charges through the pages of Stephen Fry's novel, THE HIPPOPOTAMUS, like a stallion on steroids.  And there is some \\"horsing around\\" in this book, to be sure.<br /><br />Fry's writing style, as he uses Ted to wax philosophical on everything from the battle of the sexes to drunken politicians, is an abolute delight.  The author's words flow smoothly and precisely, culminating in a punchline guaranteed to prompt a snicker, if not a robust laugh.  Ted, a washed-up poet down on his luck, is paid a handsome sum by Jane, his god-daughter, to investigate some very strange events taking place at the estate of her uncle, Lord Michael Logan.  Seems Michael's teenage son David, who also happens to be Ted's godson, is at the center of a bizarre series of \\"miracle healings.\\"  And the manner in which young Davey is healing. . .well, let's just say it is not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />With cranky and skeptical and irreverent panache, Ted gets to the bottom of the mystery, and presents his conclusions to Michael's loved ones and house guests in a scene that had me rolling on the floor.  Unfortunately, Fry's ending is a little weak, with Wallace slipping out of his nasty character; but this flaw was not enough to proudly rate this work five stars.<br /><br />THE HIPPOPOTAMUS, as mentioned before, is not for the faint of heart.  There are some passages that many may find extremely disturbing, so readers with a \\"moral mission,\\" as described above, should best look elsewhere.  Stephen Fry has a remarkable gift for writing comedic novels; for those who enjoy the genre this book is a must-read.<br /><br />--D. Mikels	2005-05-11

The glass is half-empty, with a hole in the bottom of it.  Former CIA official Michael Scheuer grinds his axe and laments the alleged futility of the current war on terror in his book, IMPERIAL HUBRIS.<br /><br />Scheuer, a shameless, unabashed admirer of Osama bin Laden, forfeits any and all credibility when he calls the al Qaeda mastermind \\"pious, charismatic, gentle, generous, talented, and personally courageous\\" (p. 168).  Thus, his redundant--even vindictive--arguments ring hollow.  He stubbornly maintains the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq are dismal failures, and that the peoples of both countries do not want or desire democracy (an argument disproved when Iraqis turned out en masse to elect a representative government).  Scheuer then goes on to say U.S. aggression in both countries is inciting hatred in the Muslim world--yet his solution, a \\"scorched earth\\" military campaign designed to kill hundreds of thousands and destroy several nations' infrastructure, would guarantee America evil pariah status throughout the entire international community.<br /><br />IMPERIAL HUBRIS is a bitter, anti-Semitic book, written by an author who wraps himself in the bloody carnage of the American Civil War for analogy on how today's war on terror should be waged.  Despite my utter disapproval of this book, I will reluctantly agree with Scheuer's assessment that America's watered down invasions in the Muslim world have fanned the flames of terror, leaving the door open for al Qaeda to attack once again on U.S. soil--an attack to dwarf 9/11.  And I hope both the author and I are desperately wrong.<br /><br />--D. Mikels	2005-04-13

From what I understand, several motives drove Larry McMurtry to write the other three books in the \\"Lonesome Dove\\" series; I only wish he had resisted all temptations and allowed Gus and Call to dwell in literary history exclusively in the pages of his Pulitzer Prize winning novel.  But, I realize, I'm whistling up a ladder:  a sequel (\\"Streets of Laredo\\") and two prequels (\\"Dead Man's Walk\\" and COMANCHE MOON) were written, and now that the \\"Lonesome Dove\\" series is complete, with McMurtry's COMANCHE MOON, I found myself relishing a psuedo \\"closure\\" with the story--with the author's unforgettable characters.<br /><br />COMANCHE MOON is a delightful read, starting in the mid-1850's, when Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call were coming into their own as newly-promoted Captains in the Texas Rangers.  Gus and Call's main task:  keep marauding bands of Comanches, led by the menacing Buffalo Hump, out of the western frontier settlements (no easy task, given the Rangers' limited resources and manpower).  Even more fun, we get to meet, for the first time, the mainstays of Lonesome Dove's Hat Creek Cattle Company:  Deets, Pea Eye Parker, Jake Spoon--Newt Dobbs.  For this very reason, there is so much more of a \\"connection\\" with \\"Lonesome Dove,\\" a fact making this prequel so entertaining.<br /><br />Yet, despite its entertainment value, what is this book about?  What is the motor that drives the story?  Why are we reading about Gus and Call as they travel the llano estacado in search of bad guys (some very, very bad guys)?  I must confess:  after some 750-plus pages, I still don't know what this book is about, as the plot meanders and swirls over some 10-year period, and nothing. . .nothing. . .is resolved, when it ends.  We are introduced to a plethora of interesting characters, who do very interesting things, but their deeds (or misdeeds) do nothing to enhance the nonstory.  And Maggie Tilton, Newt's long-suffering mother who so desperately loves Call, leaves the story with an insignificant whimper that did her character no justice.  On turning the last page I felt so incomplete I wish there had been another 300, or more, pages to tie up infinite loose ends.  For one thing:  the town--Lonesome Dove--does, briefly, dominate the story, yet we're given no details telling us how Gus and Call left the Rangers, left Austin, and moved south to the Rio Grande.  An integral facet setting up \\"Lonesome Dove,\\" I would maintain, so why doesn't McMurtry provide more information?<br /><br />There are also numerous chronological/timeline/plot inconsistencies leading into \\"Lonesome Dove,\\" but I won't go over this tired old ground; it's been rehashed via several reviews on this website.  But I will express my utter disapointment, for a book coming out of a major publishing house like Simon & Schuster, at all the typos--and just plain sloppiness--of the copy.  Where in the world were the copy editors?  On Spring Break?  They weren't paying attention to the proofs, that's for sure, so reading this book becomes a most turbulent experience.<br /><br />For diehard fans of the \\"Lonesome Dove\\" series, COMANCHE MOON will, overall, constitute a must-read.  For those of us who mourn the fact the original novel spawned three other books, this novel has its moments--and its problematic non-moments.  I only wish this book hadn't been written, but since it has, I recommend it with very reserved reluctance.<br /><br />--D.

The reaction to this book on the part of many reviewers only proves George Carlin's point:  That we as a society have become too sensitive, intolerant, and politically correct.  Yes, much of this book is stinging, biting--even morbid--but Carlin's wit and wonderful writing ability thoroughly entertain through the pages of WHEN WILL JESUS BRING THE PORK CHOPS?<br /><br />Here we have Carlin at his absolute curmudgeonly, disrespectful best.  Nothing--and I mean nothing--is sacred in this book, as Carlin launches attacks, observations, and rants over everything from the government, to religion, to politics and politicians, to entertainment, to our diet, our lifestyles, our collective insecurity as a culture--you name it.  And most of it is funny, some of it distasteful. . .and then some of it so off-the-wall I was wondering if the author had lapsed into another state of consciousness (and not from this world).<br /><br />By far my most enjoyable portions of the book had to do with Carlin's discussion of all the endless euphemisms invented to take the bluntness out of life and make us all feel better about ourselves.  For instance, we no longer have \\"poor people,\\" we have the \\"economically disadvantaged.\\"  How nice.  A nursing home is now an \\"assisted living center.\\"  Even funeral homes have become \\"death-care centers.\\"  Over and over, Carlin points out the countless euphemisms we have adopted to sanitize and plunder our language--and it's funny and sad at the same time.<br /><br />But relax, my friends.

When young Nancy Astley, a Whitstable \\"oyster girl,\\" first sees the handsome Kitty Butler, dressed as a boy, entertaining at the local music hall, Nancy's life is changed forever.  Realizing she has more than just a casual infatuation with the talented entertainer, Nancy abandons her family and accompanies Kitty to London, where the two of them become inseparable--in every sense of the word.  But alas, Nancy has left herself incredibly vulnerable, and when the inevitable pain and sorrow of heartbreak confront her, she goes off on her own for a mind-boggling series of adventures that left me chuckling, or sucking in my breath, with each turned page.<br /><br />This book has been labeled as \\"lesbian erotica,\\" but I found the story to be much broader than that (Waters is simply too gifted a writer).  Granted, had Nancy been a \\"Neville,\\" and Kitty a \\"Kirk,\\" with both characters exploring their love, I would have been more than a tad bit uncomfortable, so the feminine point of view worked very well for this old bloke, I assure you.  But even more remarkable than the titillating erotica was Waters' extraordinary ability to recreate--via her impressive, sweeping prose--the sights, sounds, smells of London in the \\"Gay Nineties.\\"  From \\"tom\\" to \\"tony,\\" from \\"masher\\" to \\"saucy,\\" the reader is completely and delightfully immersed in the slang, the jargon, the behaviour of the historical period.<br /><br />TIPPING THE VELVET is an exceptional debut novel.  I give it less than five stars for two reasons:  1) the predictability of the plot; 2) the tiresome, Sinclair-istic endorsement of boring Socialism (Why, oh why, are most authors such handwringing leftists?).

HUNTED PAST REASON has potential, and with gifted author Richard Matheson at the helm the reader is definitely in for a suspenseful, white-knuckle thriller.  But the book has two glaring problems:  1) it's over the top; 2) it's sloppy.<br /><br />Successful writer Bob Hansen wants to write a novel about backpacking in the wilderness; problem is, he's never been backpacking in the wilderness.  Enter Doug Crowley, a marginal friend of Bob's.  Doug's career as an actor is going down the tubes--but he's an experienced outdoorsman.  He offers to take Bob on a backpacking trek across the northern California woodlands, and Bob's opportunity to experience the \\"Great Wide Open\\" is set.  Of course, little does Bob know that Doug is about to snap, and when Doug goes bats he doesn't fool around--he gets downright demonic.  Thus the real adventures begin, as Bob fights for survival in the wilds, not only against his nutty nemesis, but against Mother Nature as well.<br /><br />But this book unravels, for several reasons.  Among them, the philosophical arguments between Bob and Doug about an \\"after life.\\"  These discussions were surreal, and completely out of place with the pacing of the story.  Doug's behavior after his mental meltdown was as unbelievable as an elephant swimming the Atlantic--and the physical injury and abuse both protagonist and antagonist endured as the story limped to its zany climax caused me to conclude the characters were genetic mutants (no normal human could survive such abuse).  Finally, with Bob continuing to cross paths with bears, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, porcupines, coyotes, etc., I wasn't sure if I was reading a thriller or watching a Walt Disney cartoon.<br /><br />Equally disappointing was Matheson's writing.  Granted, he utilizes a sparse, less-is-more style, but much of it comes across as awkward--even worse, sloppy.  When the reader is subconsciously rewriting the author's sentences to smooth them out, the reading experience becomes less than enjoyable.

And what's more, it's a story that moves at a snail's pace--a story almost as frozen as icycles hanging from a Victorian setting.  And the characters?  We have William Rackham, a rebellious, unambitious cretin who, after just one visit to the remarkable prostitute Sugar, suddenly becomes a baron of industry by taking over his father's soap-making business, so that he may comfortably support his new toy.  And Sugar?  She's good at what she does, to be sure, yet her life of degradation has made her a manhater extraordinaire, as evidenced by the brutal novel she's secretly writing. There's poor Agnes Rackham, William's fragile wife, so mentally and emotionally unstable the reader never gets a chance to know her, and what's the point of Henry Rackham, William's elder brother--a man tormented by his faith and his lust for a widow--other than to fill a couple of hundred pages?  Finally, the ending is as abrupt as a statement from my accountant.<br /><br />And yet, I give THE CRIMSON PETAL AND THE WHITE five enthusiastic stars.  Why, you may ask?  (Notice I'm lapsing into Victorian formality.)  Because, my dear sir/madam, author Michel Faber is one of the most talented writers I've ever had the pleasure to experience.  Faber doesn't just tell the story, a story set in London of the 1870's, he presents it in full, intricate detail.  This book has been called a modern Dickensen novel, and the comparison to Dickens is certainly appropriate when it comes to Faber's meticulous attention to setting, background, attire, and the appearance of the people he brings to life.  Yet Faber's descriptive prose is further enhanced by his marvelous mastery of the English language, by his ability to create fluid, flowing passages that are best read out loud, where they can be savored and tasted like fine wine.  And then, just when the reader is mesmerized by all the elegant prose, the author will discreetly throw in a four-letter bomb (or other nasty vulgarity).  Such a device is jarring, but oh so effective--and entertaining.<br /><br />THE CRIMSON PETAL AND THE WHITE, with its superficial story and (mainly) unlikeable characters, is carried, enhanced, and glorified by Faber's uncanny talent.

Brilliant.  Unscrupulous.  Conniving.  Ruthless.  Vindictive.  Ambitious.  Corrupt.  Malevolent.  I could go on and on (and on), but the fact remains I can't add any additional words to my list after reading AMERICAN EVITA, Christopher Andersen's alleged hard-hitting biography of the Woman Who Would Be King.<br /><br />Andersen merely recycles, rehashes, and regurgitates information that has long been common knowledge.  We all knew Hillary was a radical in the Sixties, with ties to the Black Panthers, the PLO, and other fringe wacko groups.  We all knew Hillary married William Jefferson Clinton due to political expediency and ambition.  We all knew Hillary was the behind-the-scenes power broker for all of Bill's campaigns, and that she was in charge of damage control when yet another \\"bimbo eruption\\" made headlines.  We all knew (and know) she swears like a drunken sailor.  And we all know she wants to be president.  So, Mr. Andersen, would you kindly tell us something new?<br /><br />Granted, much of the material presented was delightfully fun to read (for example, Bill's constant, rampant womanizing), but I also got the impression the book was hastily written to meet the publisher's deadline.  And while Andersen pulls his information from a vast array of published accounts, news items, and interviews, he also occasionally drops in a zinger or two from unnamed sources.  That doesn't work for me:  If an author is to have any credibility, that \\"former staffer,\\" or \\"friend,\\" or \\"White House aide\\" had best be named--otherwise the quote has little merit.<br /><br />AMERICAN EVITA is a fun and fast read, but it's kind of like eating a mayonnaise sandwich.

And not only that, the story involves--shuddering--romance, a sure-fire factor to guarantee a premature toss into my ever-growing 'yawn bin.'  Yet the author's fluid, engrossing, compelling, tragic, poignant story of three remarkable characters spread across the world--in three different places and times--easily overcame my chest-thumping machismo and allowed me to enjoy, to savor, Maas' seductive tale.<br /><br />Nataraj.  Savitri.  Sarojini.  Three unforgettable characters, three lives involved in a cataclysmic clash of cultures--of the ancient, and the modern:  three lives as intertwined and interdependent as the notes on a piece of music.  Maas directs and orchestrates their lives with an engaging talent that draws the reader in, makes him or her care--and care deeply--what happens next.  The author draws from an abundant well of both personal observation and painstaking research to breathe life into vivid people from three continents--and her work resounds with ringing credibility.<br /><br />This is good stuff.<br /><br />OF MARRIAGEABLE AGE is an absorbing read, and highly recommended.

In particular, the monotheistic Semitic religions over the course of history have proven to be the most rigid and intolerant of other faiths; this 'my way or the highway' approach has resulted in warfare, conquests, and carnage that--unfortunately--carries through to today.<br /><br />In the post-9/11 world, Islam has occupied center stage of our global lexicon.  In the name of this religion, international networks of terrorism have been spawned to attack, kill, and terrify.  And Islam, like any other faith, has its problems--the totalitarian intolerance of dissent being one of its ugliest thorns.  Under such a foreboding environment, Canadian TV journalist Irshad Manji dares to speak out via an open letter to all Muslims in her compelling and riveting book, THE TROUBLE WITH ISLAM.<br /><br />Granted, the author openly admits she is grappling with her faith; one day, she laments, she may leave Islam for good.  Yet Manji has the courage and fortitude to shed light on the myriad of problems inflicting her faith:  the oppression of women in the Arab and Muslim world; the unwavering intolerance of other religions in Arab and Muslim nations; the rampant anti-Semitism festering and infecting mosques around the world.  The author presents a convincing case that Islam has been captured by zealots who espouse a malignant, narrow interpretation of the Koran:  an interpretation that portrays Islam as an antiquated relic looking backward--instead of a peaceful vehicle for adaptation and change in an ever-changing world.  This rigid adherence to the past, according to Manji, is defined as 'foundamentalism,' or 'desert Islam.'  And the author calls for the 'silent majority' of moderate Muslims to come together to reject such fundamentalism, beginning with Muslims in the West--Muslims who have the freedom to speak their minds.<br /><br />THE TROUBLE WITH ISLAM is a remarkable, engrossing page-turner.  Manji presents her arguments, evidence, and observations in a delightfully conversational--often witty--style.  Based on the dozens and dozens of one-star reviews of this book, the author and other Muslims calling for sweeping reform have their work cut out for them; on the other hand, each critique represents the opportunity for dialogue--dialogue inherently welcomes discussion.  And a frank, open, and honest discussion of Islam is absolutely in order.<br /><br />--D.

Wearing sandals and ponytails, they live life day-to-day, preach love and peace and communal harmony, and view mankind through the haze of hemp.  To such noble individuals the novel BOOGA is dedicated; it is a free spirit manifesto.<br />Novelist Hayes Brown (no doubt a free spiriter himself) tells us about Henry Clay &quot;Boo&quot; Rasmuson, a man disenfranchised with society to such an extent that he quits his job, leaves his betrothed, travels across the country to compete in bommerang tournaments (yes, boomerang tournaments), and ultimately intends to kill himself.  Over the course of his travels, he picks up a female hitchhiker, a vagabond journalist, and a store mannequin (yes, a store mannequin).  Flo, the mannequin, slowly but surely comes to life (after the characters have shared several joints, of course) and names the little group &quot;Booga&quot;--which is short for &quot;Boomerang Gang.&quot;  (No, I'm not making this up.)  And thus Booga travels the UCS (the United Capitalistic States) and very innocently becomes an icon for free spirit types of every stripe and persuasion.<br />Brown has a gift for humor, and his story reads well--especially when he inserts his own vocabulary into his prose.  Yet I'm reminded of a slogan made famous two decades ago:  &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;  BOOGA is a frame without substance, as the characters move from one hemp-induced adventure to the next in whirlwind fashion with zero time for reflection, contemplation, or introspection.  When the most evolved character is a wooden mannequin, the author has a slight problem.  And then, the reader is treated to lots of &quot;peace and love&quot; and &quot;live and let live.&quot;  And ganja.  Hey, Booga, where's your air freshener?<br />--D. Mikels	2004-07-11

It seems the Earth's spinning on its axis has less to do with physics and more to do with those who don't have money chasing those who have it.  And novelist/satirist Martin Amis cashes in on the corrupting influence of currency with his delightfully savage book, MONEY.<br />Director John Self is a self-admitted loser.  There's not much to like about him:  he smokes too much, drinks too much--he's an irresponsible buffoon with an addiction to porn and prostitutes.  But he's got money, and as he waits for the financing of his next film to come together, he makes London and New York his sinful playgrounds.  Leapfrogging back and forth across the pond, he leaves a shambled trail of self-destruction in his wake.  Over the course of his bizarre journey, John shares his thoughts and philosophy on the intricacies of life:  Life according to John Self, a drunken bugger with money.  In fact, the story happily plays a second fiddle to John's reflections, and John's reflections carry the story from one zany mishap to the next.<br />Amis is sheer genius.  He writes with a demented pomposity--a politically incorrect finger-in-your-eye--that has the reader laughing one moment, cringing the next.  With a clever tongue-in-cheek device to show nothing is sacred, he even inserts himself into the story.  It's fascinating reading, as Amis allows his protagonist's thoughts to wander all over the dysfunctional map of human corruption (often within the same paragraph).  MONEY is a triumphant satire that blasts away at our consumer culture and reveals our fragile human foibles.  It is the type of book I wish I had the backbone to write.<br />--D.

It continues to be one of my favorite books.  Historian and former OU sports information director Harold Keith actually makes history \\"fun\\" for teenagers with this award-winning tale, as RIFLES FOR WAITIE gives readers a full account of the brutal Civil War campaign in the Indian Territories of the frontier.<br />At the heart of Keith's story is young Jeff Bussey, who joins a regiment of Kansas volunteers as a 16-year-old, idealistic adventure seeker.  Jeff's idealism is short-lived once he confronts the horrors and barbarism of war; it is replaced by disillusionment, bitterness, fear.  Although written in the Fifties, Keith cuts no corners in portraying the brutality of the Civil War in Oklahoma Territory; the reader can smell the smoke, hear the deafening roar of cannon, feel the bullets whistle past.  And as young Jeff matures. . .becomes a battle-hardened survivor. . .he is sent on an assignment behind enemy lines--only to discover the men he is fighting are just like him:  cold, tired, hungry, and ready to go home.<br />Wonderfully written and flawlessly paced, RIFLES FOR WAITIE is an absorbing read.  Highly recommended for teenagers or history buffs wanting to learn more about the Civil War in Oklahoma.<br />--D. Mikels	2004-06-26

Long ago I discarded weightlifting and running to become a full-time couch potato.  The reason:  I very quickly become bored with the repetition of exercise--any exercise.  I'd rather watch Fox News girls than sweat through curls anyway, so my motivation to resume physical activity was zilch.<br />Then, via the magic of the Internet, I heard about THE FIVE TIBETANS, and I bought this slim and trim volume.  This was my cup of yogic tea:  five exercises--none of them too vigorous--twenty-one reps.  And I can easily find ten to twelve minutes a day to perform them.  I now enthusiastically look forward to the Tibetans each evening; having utilized them, I now enjoy more energy, sleep better, am more limber. . .stronger.  No, the Tibetans are not the regimen for those wanting to look like Olympian gods, but then again, I'm not going to compete in any triathlon; the pace and intensity of these exercises suits me fine.<br />Christopher S. Kilham has put together a very informative booklet--one that can be turned to time and again for future reference.  His breathing techniques are excellent, by the way.  I'm less than enthusiastic about his discussions of kundalini meditation and yoganidra (deep relaxation), but that's just me.  I'll just stick to the Tibetans.  Finally, I'd like to thank fellow reviewer doctor_beth for bringing to my attention THE FIVE TIBETANS.  Muchas gracias, amigo!<br />--D. Mikels	2004-05-25

For me, alas, Bulgakov's THE MASTER AND MARGARITA evoked the latter, although I finished the book and readily appreciated the author's rather fantastic and satirical story of Satan and his pesky retinue wreaking havoc in 1930s Moscow.<br />That Mikhail Bulgakov is an exceptional writer is a given; if only I was fluid in Russian where I could read his words as written I would no doubt be even more impressed with his prose and style.  This Vintage Press edition (translated by Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor) certainly pays homage to this classic with a meticulous eye for detail, followed by notes on each chapter that I found to be invaluable.  So then, what's the problem?<br />Well, I enjoy humor and satire as much as the next guy (I suppose), but a story depicting Satan as some sort of instrument of salvation--an instrument in alliance with Yeshua--for the book's two protagonists was just. . .too much.  The Master, a writer who cannot endure the pain of rejection, is one-dimensional and sullen, while Margarita, his love, becomes a willing pawn of the devil.  And the story blithely suggests that death through its mortal release is preferable to life (which is understandable, given Bulgakov's failing health as he finished the book).  The fantastic notion of the story--of illusion, madness, a huge talking cat, flying through the air, and a Satanic ball--is a clever device, but eventually it wears thin.<br />As a playwright, Bulgakov uses an abundance of theater officers, bureaucrats, and authors as unhappy victims of Satan's antics (no doubt the author was settling countless scores); unfortunately, the names of these characters are in Russian, and many of the names vary by a vowel or a letter, making it very difficult for the reader to keep track of &quot;who's who.&quot;  And the parallel story of Pontius Pilate and the crucifixion--told from a political, not spiritual, perspective--was interesting, yet bizarre.  In fact, &quot;bizarre&quot; is a good word to describe THE MASTER AND MARGARITA in its entirety; it's an interesting, fantastic, metaphysical tale, yet requires too much suspension of disbelief.<br />--D.

Kowing originally hails from my neck of the woods in Oklahoma, I was elated to learn he published a novel, and intrigued enough to purchase a copy of his book from this website.  Kowing certainly has a passion for writing, combined with a keen affection for northern California's redwood country.  Someday he could very well develop his craft to become a writer to be reckoned with; however, his debut novel, EMPTY SPACES, points out some glaring weaknesses and discrepancies that distract--and ultimately annoy--the reader.<br />Mapdot, California, is a picturesque, quiet town located on the northern California coast.  As with most small towns, life in Mapdot moves at a leisurely pace, and all of its citizens know one another on more than just a casual basis.  Enter Gene Rand, a writer from Los Angeles who is trying to move on after a bitter divorce.  Gene wishes to settle in the scenic town and be left alone, yet he finds himself drawn to Rhyze (pronounced \\"Rise\\") Damon, a striking beauty who runs the town's chocolate shoppe.  Rhyze, who has been unlucky at love herself, exudes an aura that one could only describe as \\"bewitching.\\"  A tentative, timid romance ensues--only to be tempted by a wild seductress with a most unhealthy fetish, a woman who has her sights set on Gene.<br />While the story itself is superficially interesting enough to continue reading, this is a book that cries out for an experienced, professional editor.  A POD publishing house like 1st Books does not oversee the editorial process of its titles, and in this case, it shows.  Unfortunately, the book suffers from several maladies--from typos, sentence fragments, and run-ons, to severe punctuation/capitalization issues on quotations, to dangling adverbs, to a plethora of confusing, nonsensical sentences.  A good editor would have helped the author solve several timeline and setting discrepancies, plus an editor would have helped develop the ending, which needs a lot of work.<br />At 500 pages, this book is at least forty thousand words too long (again, a good editor would have trimmed it down considerably).  While EMPTY SPACES is an obvious labor of love for J.A. Kowing, it presents an uncomfortable reading experience, and suggests the author should hone and develop his writing skills before he effectively finds his voice.<br />--D.

Published a year after his banishment from the University of Oklahoma (following a series of turbulent off-the-field incidents), Switzer tells all in his rousing autobigraphy, BOOTLEGGER'S BOY.<br />The title is not an exaggeration; Switzer's father was a womanizing, hard-drinking Arkansas bootlegger, while his quiet mother battled mental problems and an addiction of her own.  Able to overcome such dysfunction (and some of his family tales are fascinating), Switzer was able to utilize his athletic ability to play football at the University of Arkansas under legendary coach Frank Broyles.  When his college career was over, Switzer realized his calling was coaching; Broyles gave him the opportunity by letting the young lineman join his coaching staff.  In the mid-60s firebrand coach Jim MacKenzie was hired to restore the football &quot;monster&quot; at OU, a monster that the great Wilkinson had created.  MacKenzie offered Switzer a position on his coaching staff; Switzer became a Sooner, and the seeds of destiny were sewn.<br />Chuck Fairbanks, succeeding MacKenzie (who died tragically after just a year on the job), promoted Switzer to offensive coordinator.  Switzer writes he was looking for an offense to revolutionize college football; an unorthodox, high-risk option offense, known as the &quot;wishbone,&quot; captured his attention.  Switzer installed the offense and the Sooners took off, figuratively and literally, as NCAA rushing records were shattered.  When Fairbanks bolted in 1973 to go to the NFL, Switzer was handed the keys to the OU program, and the rest, as they say in the Sooner Nation, is history.<br />For sixteen seasons, Switzer commanded a college football powerhouse; during his tenure the Sooners captured twelve Big Eight championships and three national championships.  Switzer attributes his success to his Arkansas upbringing; growing up, most of his friends and neighbors were African-Americans.  As a result, Switzer was more than comfortable approaching black athletes--at a time when other major programs were tentatively recruiting minorities--while reassuring parents that he would take good care of their sons.  His recruiting redefined collegiate athletics, opening the doors for black athletes nationwide to participate in Division One football.<br />Switzer's affection for his players is genuine.  Page after page, account after account, the King (as he's known by Sooner diehards) fondly recalls his relationships with a plethora of All-Americans:  the Selmon brothers; Joe Washington; Billy Sims; Tony Casillas; J.C. Watts; Keith Jackson; Brian Bosworth.  Switzer was no stern disciplinarian, he readily admits it, and this &quot;lack&quot; of discipline created a perception of an outlaw program--a perception that came home to roost in 1989, when he was forced to resign by the OU administration during a series of troubling incidents that ultimately put the Sooners under NCAA probation.<br />Switzer defiantly addresses the NCAA allegations, refuting some and pleading &quot;guilty&quot; to others.  To enhance his arguments, he points to antiquated NCAA regulations (and keep in mind, this book was written years ago), regulations that, Switzer maintains, permeate a double standard.  As an example, Switzer argues, why is it permissible for a chemistry professor to dig into his pocket and buy an airplane ticket for a homesick student during Christmas break, but not an athletic coach?  Switzer's defense, along with his account of the events leading up to his ouster, make for fascinating page turning.<br />Praise him or revile him, Barry Switzer's mark on college football is eternal, and BOOTLEGGER'S BOY is the King at his good ol' boy best.  I only wish he would come back with a second edition describing his four seasons with the Dallas Cowboys.  Three national championship rings and a Super Bowl ring.

And then there's the billionaire who had his employees recruit scores of young women to satisfy his \\"appetite.\\"<br />Interesting stuff, to say the least.<br />Published over two decades ago, THE INTIMATE SEX LIVES OF FAMOUS PEOPLE still provides chuckles, giggles, and even a raised eyebrow or two as the reader becomes privy to the bedroom antics of dozens and dozens of \\"celebrities\\" (most of them historical figures).  Written by the Wallace family (novelist Irving, wife Sylvia, daughter Amy and son David) this is a well-researched and sometimes overwhelming volume that presents the material as matter-of-fact and only gets risque when the subjects--through actual letters or conversations--are allowed to \\"speak for themselves.\\"<br />The \\"famous people\\" are a veritable \\"Who's Who\\" from all walks of life and epochs of history.  Henry VIII.  Leo Tolstoi.  Gary Cooper.  Warren G. Harding.  Joan Crawford.  Douglas MacArthur.  Elvis Presley.  Page after page, person after person, the intimate tidbits of those we revere--or despise--are revealed.<br />THE INTIMATE SEX LIVES OF FAMOUS PEOPLE reminds me of a bag of Lay's Potato Chips.

But then, I feel like crying, and if he sees me cry, maybe he'll realize what a jerk he's been.  No, don't go there:  don't you DARE let that jerk see you cry!<br />Makes me want to cry.<br />For cryin' out loud, I GOT YOU, BABE marked my brief and solitary sojourn into the romance genre.  On the run for a crime she didn't commit, blonde bombshell Renee Esterhaus bumps into John DeMarco, a stern cop hiding his true heart of gold.  John realizes he must do his duty and take Renee in, but there's something about her he just can't put his finger on--even though he'd like to put more than just his fingers on her.  The two characters' on-again/off-again relationship results in a 200-plus page tease that calls to mind a futile lap dance that never ends.  &quot;Get on with it,&quot; I kept saying to this little book, &quot;not that I care, but maybe a real story will emerge afterwards.&quot;<br />But I really couldn't find a real story, although I GOT YOU, BABE has an implausible one.  From the two protagonists' chance encounter, to all the subsequent escapes and confrontations, to a bewildering crime investigation, to a laugh-out-loud crossdressing conclusion, to all sorts of plot irregularities and errors on the part of the author, I kept wondering why I stubbornly limped to the final page.  And I got so tired of countless character introspection--ten pages of Renee wondering what John REALLY thought of her, followed by ten more pages of John returning the favor as he agonizes over Renee.<br />Again, it makes me want to cry.<br />To be fair to author Jane Graves, she does possess a keen sense of humor and an admirable ability to create steamy scenes.  Unfortunately, both qualities were not enough to carry this story.  I'll give I GOT YOU BABE 2 1/2 stars.  But only after a good cry.<br />--D. Mikels	2004-03-23

His novel ARMAGEDDON rarely makes such a list, which is a shame, as this powerful story reveals an accomplished author able to weave a riveting tale populated by a stunning array of complex characters.<br />I first read ARMAGEDDON over thirty years ago; it was my introduction to Uris--an intro that led me in an enthusiastic frenzy to his other works.  While I have enjoyed them all (especially \\"QB VII\\"), I keep coming back to ARMAGEDDON as Uris' definitive accomplishment.  Written during the height of the Cold War--detailing the alarming complexities of the Soviet blockade of Berlin following World War II and the subsequent Allied airlift--this novel explores post-war Germany from literally dozens of different perspectives.<br />This is a compelling read, beginning with the liberation of the Nazi death camps, when angry and frustrated Allied commanders ordered German citizens from neighboring towns to tour the prisons and see firsthand the atrocities their government had committed.  As Soviet domination in eastern Germany threatens to choke the divided city of Berlin, Uris relates the fascinating events of the Allied airlift--a herculean task involving British and American cargo planes flying around the clock into the west side of the city to deliver supplies.  If not for the airlift, West Berlin would have collapsed and succumbed to Soviet domination.<br />The story is told through the points of view of a multitude of characters:  an American pilot; a young German woman; a former SS officer who was forced to perform unspeakable acts; British, American, even Russian commanders.  The list of characters coming in and out of the story is formidable, yet convincing and essential.  And, like Uris' other books, ARMAGEDDON is essentially a portrayal of the indomitable human spirit; for Uris fans unfamiliar with this book, or for fans of historical fiction this novel is highly recommended.<br />--D.

Books	5	227	264	N	N	This Epiphany Rattled the Elite Media	Epiphanies are good things.  They are psychological wake-up calls to clarity and truth.  They cut through years of mental and societal conditioning to expose common sense like a bright copper penny at the bottom of a swimming pool.<br />ABC consumer reporter (and co-anchor of the news show \\"20/20\\") John Stossel shares his epiphany through the pages of his entertaining and informative book, GIVE ME A BREAK.  For years, Stossel developed a reputation as a fearless and relentless crusader by exposing rip-off artists, scams, boondoggles, and other unspeakable corruption--all in the interest of protecting the public at large from greedy and selfish corporations.  For this, Stossel was an award-winning media darling, a welcome addition to the leftist culture that permeates and controls network news.<br />But a funny thing happened on the way to liberal nirvana:  Stossel began taking a look not only at the warts of the private sector, but at those who regulate the warts as well.  And he found some troubling wart hairs--from a $330,000 outhouse paid by tax dollars, to a town in Missouri essentially bulldozed because dioxin found in the soil \\"might\\" be harmful to its inhabitants, to corporate \\"welfare queens\\" who grow even richer on the backs of hardworking taxpayers.  Thus, after 15 years of reporting, Stossel's epiphany was born:  government isn't the solution, it's the problem.  We don't need more government to interfere and obstruct, we need less.<br />And this revelation really hit below the belt:  capitalism actually works.<br />Accordingly, Stossel began broadcasting this heresy (giving credit to several people at ABC for having the backbone to air his opinions); he instantly went from media darling to pariah.  The \\"totalitarian left,\\" as Stossel phrases it, was incensed.  Countless efforts were made to get him off the air, get him fired, yet Stossel persevered, and now shares his trials and tribulations in this delightful book.<br />GIVE ME A BREAK is a quick, energetic read that will get you pumped up, regardless of your political persuasion.  Stossel's writing style is identical to his broadcast narrative, making the reader feel comfortable and casual.  Finally, this is anything but a conservative tome; it is a libertarian manifesto, as sacred cows on both sides of the spectrum are gored.  Give me a break?  No, give me an epiphany, instead.

Henry, or &quot;Hank,&quot; is the interim chair of a delightfully dysfunctional English department at a small Pennsylvania college.  Because he doesn't want to turn out like the moody and disgruntled professors he works with, Hank refuses to take life seriously; whenever an earnest statement is uttered, Hank counters with an off-the-cuff witticism--in essence, every person who comes in contact with him becomes a &quot;straight man.&quot;  His demeanor has worn thin with his colleagues, even with his family, and over the course of a very eventful early spring week the midlife trials and tribulations of Hank Devereaux will come to a hilarious, yet endearing, fruition.<br />Russo writes a relaxed, comfortable prose; his humorous timing--while simultaneously keeping the main character's first-person point of view on target--is marvelous.  Yes, Hank is a smart aleck, but he's a lovable smart aleck, thanks to Russo's powerful storytelling ability.  Yet despite all the humour and wit, there is also a deep underlying theme of melancholy and angst, all of which makes STRAIGHT MAN a compelling and highly recommended read.<br />--D.

This book was one of the most bittersweet reads I can remember:  a page where I'm engrossed, followed by a page where I'm grossed out (by the author's style, not the content).  I'm open to all sorts of subtle and not-so-subtle literary devices, and Alasdair Gray's 1982 JANINE embarks on a journey of writing creativity with all the tenderness of a sledgehammer.<br />The premise of Gray's story is interesting:  a burned-out, middle-aged businessman drowning his sorrows in a shabby motel room while concocting a series of farfetched sexual fantasies--all in an effort to smother the overwhelming dreariness of his actual life.  A plot dripping with existentialism, to be sure, and Gray's furious (often unreadable) style creates a mood of despair and frustration that conjures up enough alcohol-induced pink elephants to fill the San Diego Zoo.  Yet the style also works against the story, as it becomes redundant to the point where its impact is lost.  And as an aside, Gray's (through his protagonist) preoccupation with white silk blouses and button-down denim skirts became downright annoying.  I would have preferred to have seen a little spandex, myself.<br />This is no \\"light\\" read; the author's style requires the reader to pay close attention.  Yet there is a literally unreadable chapter--when Jock, our protagonist, takes a bottle of sleeping pills on top of his fifth of whiskey--where my heart went out to the copy editor who had to tackle all the nonsensical and upside down prose.  The author waits until the end of his story to tell us the intimate details of Jock's trials and tribulations, then gives us an anticlimactic ending in the form of a very weak epiphany that doesn't measure up to all of the madness running rampant through the preceding pages.  So as I reach for the aspirin, I would like to believe that 1982 JANINE is a metaphorical Mae West:  when it's good, it's very, very good--when it's bad, it's blathering nonsense.<br />--D.

This is a thought-provoking, philosophical read, a story about a life re-examined existentially through a series of revealing vignettes sprinkled with, for lack of a better term, some imaginative science fiction.<br />This book leaves behind the tired, one-dimensional, recycled, rehashed, regurgitated storylines overwhelming the current fiction marketplace; it's an allegorical examination of the human condition that challenges the reader to think and to move beyond his or her mental comfort zone.  Because the story itself--with its metaphysical glimpse into the distant future--is fantastic, the book requires a supreme suspension of disbelief, and some of the author's prose is jarring (which is, I think, the author's intent).  The story is also uneven, but certainly this is not a problem unique with the author; there are bestsellers even more glaring in this deficiency.<br />Those who appreciate visionary/metaphysical fiction will enjoy MOONA.  As a fellow author with a thin volume in this very genre, I applaud Mr. Johnson's effort.<br />--D. Mikels	2003-11-19

I first read Mario Puzo's THE GODFATHER three decades ago, and the impact it had on me was overwhelming.  Here was a rare novel that hooked the reader from the very first page, a novel to be savored and absorbed by the author's grim yet masterful prose.<br />Through the pages of this book the reader is introduced to the shadowy world of organized crime--more importantly, to the fiercely interdependent workings of the mafia.  Deeply embedded in its Italian heritage, it was a culture of unspeakable violence, but it also fostered family, honor, community, loyalty, friendship.  Vengeance.  If you are downtrodden, or unfairly victimized, all you need do is approach one of the &quot;families&quot; and request a &quot;favor.&quot;  Proclaim your devotion and friendship, the favor will be granted.  And then--even though it may never happen--you must be willing to return the favor.<br />Or suffer the consequences.<br />Puzo's novel brings to life the Corleone family, headed by its aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone.  In post-World War II New York, Corleone faces a changing world, but he is still plagued by the relentless &quot;turf wars&quot; with the other major families.  Intense pressure is brought to introduce narcotics to the list of &quot;services&quot; provided by his family--pressure that Corleone emphatically resists, to the bleak detriment of first himself, and to those he loves.  The subsequent development of the story--of the Corleone's strategy, of the emergence of one of the Godfather's sons to perpetuate the family's power and considerable clout--is spellbinding.<br />Few novels of the last thirty years have had any lasting effects on our cultural lexicon.  THE GODFATHER is one of them.  Highly recommended.<br />--D. Mikels	2003-11-03

Vladislav Tamarov furnishes a firsthand account of war's brutality in his riveting book, AFGHANISTAN:  A RUSSIAN SOLDIER'S STORY.<br />And Tamarov wasn't just any foot soldier:  as a 19-year-old draftee he was selected to be a minesweeper in a country littered with mines, where one mistake or misstep carried fatal, permanent consequences.  For 621 days in the mid-1980s Tamarov served his country in Afghanistan and did what was necessary to survive, to live another day--to be able to go home, even though &quot;home&quot; would never be the same upon his return.<br />The author shares with the reader his most intimate, personal, painful feelings about his experiences, both during and after the war.  And the accompanying photos--pictures of young soldiers little older than boys thrust into a needless war with even more needless death--are truly heartbreaking.  In fact, AFGHANISTAN:  A RUSSIAN SOLDIER'S STORY is not for the faint of heart:  it is an eye-opening account of the insanity of war that must be told, again and again.  Highly recommended.<br />--D.

D.H. Lawrence's SONS AND LOVERS greets the reader with the author's elegant prose while systematically immersing the story in a swirling cloud of tangled dysfunction.<br />Married to a drunken, rowdy coal miner in early 20th Century England, Gertrude Morel has neither a life nor a true love.  Her only chance for happiness--as she sees it--is to live vicariously through her sons:  first William, then Paul.  Her subsequent possessiveness, her relentless interference in their lives, is smothering and destructive.  When William dies, Gertrude devotes all of her attention--her manipulation--to Paul.  Her son becomes a symbolic soulmate. . .lover. . .and Gertrude is unable to let him go to pursue his own relationships.<br />Torn between his love for his mother and his guilt whenever he harbors feelings of affection for another woman, Paul is anything but a suitable suitor.  He falls in love with Miriam, but his emotional dysfunction all but dooms the relationship--a relationship constantly sabotaged by his mother.  Needing a physical outlet, he has a brief affair with a married woman, Clara Dawes, but even then, his love for and devotion to his mother prevails.  As his mother's health fails, Paul's existence becomes even more problematic, culminating in a transcendent death.<br />SONS AND LOVERS is not a &quot;feel good&quot; read, and Paul's inability to break free from the psychological bondage with his mother is frustrating and sometimes exasperating.  Yet the true victim of this Lawrence classic is not Paul, but Miriam, who only wishes to love, and be loved in return.  The man she has fallen in love with is incapable of such devotion:  the tragic complexity of the story lingers long after this book has been put down.<br />--D. Mikels	2003-09-23

Tolkien creates another world--indeed, another culture and language--in what many consider the greatest novel of the 20th Century, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  A sweeping, all-encompassing tale of a make-believe world, LOTR is the product of an imagination that may never be equalled again.<br />THE RETURN OF THE KING, being the third and final installment of this novel, takes the reader on a magical journey as the Third Age of Middle-earth comes to its dramatic conclusion, as the Fellowship of the Ring confronts for the final time the Dark Lord and his evil minions.  The battle is waged on the Pelennor Fields outside of Minas Tirith in Gondor--a battle that is costly, harrowing, intense. . .exhilarating.  Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue their journey into the heart of Darkness itself--the inhospitable, deadly land of Mordor--to continue Frodo's quest to destroy the One Ring in the blazing inferno of Mt. Doom.  And as Tolkien pulls all of the wonderful components of his epic story together, one man steps forward to claim the throne of Gondor. . .to bring healing to the war-ravaged lands of Middle-earth.<br />THE RETURN OF THE KING is the pinnacle of storytelling, but in my opinion is the weakest of the trilogy, as Tolkien creates a powerful climax then lingers for almost one hundred pages wrapping up his story.  This is augmented by the actions of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, and Pippin upon their return to the Shire; the sudden \\"machismo\\" of these Hobbits as they confront the corruption of their homeland is inconsistent with the inherent vulnerability of the characters as depicted through the books.<br />Despite my slight misgivings, THE RETURN OF THE KING is a marvelous book--an exceptional read.  Having read this epic several times, it's always a bit sad to come to the end, to say goodbye to such wonderful characters.  Highly recommended.<br />--D. Mikels	2003-08-05

A BEND IN THE ROAD is not complete birdcage liner--it is a laugh-out-loud, sophomoric work of prose:  a story one would expect to find in a spiral notebook stuffed under a mattress.  A very worn mattress, mind you, but a mattress just the same.<br />And to the author, here's a free piece of advice:  why not try the actual word, &quot;had,&quot; as opposed to your monotonous contractions when the POV is in the past tense (for instance, &quot;he'd,&quot;  &quot;she'd&quot;  &quot;they'd,&quot; &quot;agent'd&quot;).

Well, well, well, what do we have here?<br />We have THE LOOP, a novel so immersed in cliche and animal rights propaganda that the reader must sift through the wheat and the chaff to glean Nicholas Evans' story.<br />And it is a story that has been told countless--yawn--infinite times:  greedy, selfish, ignorant ranchers pitted against noble, valiant federal conservationists--true public servants who only wish to protect and preserve a dwindling wolf population in the rugged wilds of Montana.  Evans really pushes the \\"good vs. evil\\" dichotomy through his characters; \\"Buck\\" (gotta love such a redneck name) Calder is an angry, egotistical, self-aggrandizing, womanizing, verbally and physically abusive rancher to ever wear spurs since Wild Bill Hickock:  conservationist/lovelorn Helen Ross only needs a hanky-dabbing break to re-establish her fragile self-esteem.<br />Disregard the fact that federal and state conservationist laws have recently led to a proliferation of natural predatory species (i.e., wolves) that have been detrimental to the ranching industry--at an untold cost to law-abiding landowners:  Evans only presents one side of the issue, simply because the character that embodies the interests of farmers and ranchers is so reprehensible.<br />Alas, I've been on a nasty diabribe; I will give kudos to Evans' writing ability, which is marvelous, fluid, and easy on the eye.  I also envied young Luke Calder--the shy, stuttering, insecure 18-year-old son of villain Buck--who turns out to be a tree-hugger himself and becomes romantically involved with the much-older, more experienced Helen.  A remote cabin under the stars, a glowing fireplace, a side of beef jerky to share with a dazzling woman who looks good wearing flannel.  You lucky pup!<br />--D. Mikels	2003-07-06

However, this author's talent was systematically derailed by shallow, fundamentally-flawed editing that left the book, FORGOTTEN STAR, a mere shadow of its original intent.<br />The author has a knack for storytelling; this is more than abundant as we read about a Hollywood icon's self-imposed exile, her escape nurtured by benevolent allies in and out of the motion picture industry.  The author has considerable knowledge concerning Hollywood's gilded era, along with a gift for description of the bleak northwest Oklahoma landscape--hauntingly beautiful in its natural desolation.<br />Yet, unfortunately, the poor editing gets in the way.<br />To all authors eagerly publising their works via these problematic houses: Be warned. Diligently scan the fruits of your labors--word after solemn word. I highly recommend utilizing a professional editor to clean up your manuscript before it is submitted to any subsidy or POD publisher.

So is distrust of authority. Author Ken Kesey weaves both of these essential human components into his masterpiece, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.<br />The setting of this novel is an insane asylum, darkly and fearfully portrayed by Chief Bromden, the book's narrator. For it is within the wall's of this harsh, bleak institution that Authority--coined the \\"Combine\\" by the Chief--controls, directs, and manipulates every aspect of the lives of the patients. Nurse Ratched, who controls the Chief's ward, is the ultimate authority figure--a menacing, cold, callous, larger-than-life authoritarian who will stop at nothing to make sure the \\"Combine\\" stays firmly in power. Kesey, through the Chief's narrative, creates a gloomy, hopeless world, a world where the facility's patients have nothing to look forward to except the inexorable clutches of insanity.<br />Into this world appears Randle Patrick McMurphy. This character isn't insane, he's simply trying to beat a work farm rap. More importantly, McMurphy is a strong, self-willed individual; instantly, the \\"Combine\\" senses a threat to its control. The story subsequently becomes a battle of wills: McMurphy's relentless defiance against Nurse Ratched and the Establishment. Granted, McMurphy achieves a series of victories, but in the end, Authority prevails. Or does it?<br />Kesey's allegorical tribute to the indomitable human spirit is brilliant, fascinating, and timeless. His negative social critique of authority unchecked makes ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST one of the literary masterpieces of the 20th Century, a novel most enthusiastically recommended.<br />--D.

You can't defeat an opponent until you get inside his/her head, and IT TAKES A VILLAGE is Hillary's vivid socialist manifesto.<br />Yes, as Ms. Rodham contends, 75 years ago our towns and/or neighborhoods consisted primarily of extended families.  Uncle Jake and his brood lived across the street, Cousin Maple had the pink bungalow on the corner, and Grandma and Grandpa lived upstairs.  Everyone took an interest in and kept up with everyone else--including the kids.  But even back in those days, the ultimate responsibility for a child's well being and upbringing rested exclusively with the parents.  Mom and Dad called the shots, no matter what Grandma or Uncle Jake or Cousin Maple thought.  Fast forward to today, and Hillary's argument that we must somehow replace the extended family of yesteryear with social workers, bureaucrats, and other outsiders--augmented by socialized health care and education--and the village she advocates is frighteningly Orwellian.<br />Not that village.  Not with my kids.<br />Ms. Rodham's benign prose fails to mask social activism that has systematically derailed, destabilized, and destroyed the core human values that once were transcendent in our culture... She also has a disquieting affinity with the word, \\"invest (i.e., \\"tax\\").\\"  We must \\"invest\\" in our schools, \\"invest\\" in our day care centers, \\"invest\\" in child health care, \\"invest\\" in a myriad of social programs, \\"invest\\" to end poverty, homelessness, drug abuse, domestic violence, and every other societal malady one can think of.  Never mind the fact that the \\"investee\\" perhaps should take some responsibility to alleviate his or her need for \\"investment dollars\\"; Ms. Rodham only advocates her view of a village to put a happy face on any situation.<br />Wonderfully Utopian, but where is the \\"investment\\" going to come from?<br />IT TAKES A VILLAGE gives us a front row view--up close and personal--of Hillary Rodham Clinton's socialist beliefs and activist agenda.

Some of the author's rebuttals of Limbaugh's statements and beliefs are less than sincere and well-reasoned, but come on, this is satire, not rocket science.

She writes lyrical, magical prose, the words as musical and mystical as the fantasy world created in her novel, WYSARD.  Kephart has a keen eye for detail and description, and her eloquent passages are wonderfully and artfully crafted.<br />WYSARD is the story of Ryel Mirai, a young man born into the Art of spells and magic, trained and mentored in the mist-shrouded city of Markul.  Decimated by the death of Edris, his uncle and mentor, Ryel leaves the sanctuary of Markul, first to heal his mother, then to confront Dagar, an evil, mercurial spirit looking to regain human form.  Ryel's quest brings him to the city of Almancar in the Kingdom of Destimar, a city where he must pit his Art against the treachery of Dagar and his agents.<br />As well written as this book is, the story failed to involve me, to captivate me, make me care what happened next to Ryel or the other characters.  Reading is, of course, a subjective experience, so by no means should my reservations hinder others who enjoy works of fantasy.  I had some problems with the numerous flashbacks, which I felt interfered with the book's pacing, and I was troubled by all the last-minute storylines that popped up.  (Yes, I know that WYSARD is but the first of two books, yet the addition of the new characters and storylines over the novel's last 20 pages left me frustrated.)  Basically, I as the reader was on the outside looking in, never immersed in the story.<br />Personally, I hope this author will delve into other genres in addition to fantasy--historical fiction comes to mind--as her talent is more than sufficient to move all over the fictional spectrum.  I'm a big fan of Carolyn Kephart, just not as enthusiastic a fan of this story.<br />--D. Mikels	2003-05-06

It's common knowledge that the left is intolerant of dissent--that to oppose affirmative action one is a racist, to challenge NOW is to be a chauvinist, to be against abortion one is a religious fanatic.  The high priests and priestesses of political correctness have chastised, marginalized, critized, and demonized conservatism for more than 30 years; entrenched and enforced in news dissemination, higher education, wool-gathering think tanks, and the entertainment industry, they've had the bully pulpit to hammer home their leftist agenda and excoriate conservative dissent at will.<br />Conservatism, of course, has fought back, often in the face of the most venomous vitriol imaginable.  Rush Limbaugh.  Michael Reagan.  George Will.  Cal Thomas.  Sean Hannity.  The success of talk radio and the 24-hour cable news cycle has given conservatism a strong foothold in its battle against the leftist status quo.  Outside of the antics of Rush and several off-the-wall comments by G. Gordon Liddy and others of his ilk, the conservative voice has been much more restrained and subdued than the in-your-face namecalling from the left.<br />But then comes blonde, petite Ann Coulter, the epitome of a wolf in sheep's clothing.  The very title of her book, SLANDER:  LIBERAL LIES ABOUT THE AMERICAN RIGHT, is akin to walking into a biker bar to pick a fight.  And judging from the reviews on Amazon alone, the fight is on.<br />In a nutshell, Coulter is over the top.  She is pure spit and vinegar as she attacks liberalism, blaming it for virtually everything but the common cold.  And it's darn funny, some of it laugh-out-loud funny, as she lambasts Clintonianism/feminism/activism with a crisp, witty style so reminiscent of her numerous appearances on the cable talk shows.  (Calling the Florida Supreme Court, during the 2000 election ordeal, a \\"kangaroo court\\" was priceless.)  Coulter gigs, gouges, pokes, and punches enough to make liberal pit bulls like Carville and Begala look like choirboys.  And her high-octane tone is relentless, almost to the point of exhaustion.<br />Alas, the vituperation of SLANDER:  LIBERAL LIES ABOUT THE AMERICAN RIGHT only serves to drag Coulter's arguments down to the level of her emotional antagonists.

From stonewalling background checks to abusing security access, the Clinton people made sure that every day was a bad day for the FBI staff at the White House.  Aldrich relates so many anecdotes and accounts that I found myself in a state of disbelief (after all, there couldn't be that much corruption); yet, if only 10 percent of the author's allegations were true, that's enough to provide an eye-opener to even the most ardent Clinton-lover.<br />That Aldrich has an agenda--that the author has nothing but contempt and disgust for the Clintons--is more than obvious as the reader moves through this book.  Some of the personal attacks went over the top (\\"Clinton has the face of a drinker.\\"), and some of the \\"rumors\\" passed along by Aldrich are downright laughable (e.g., sneaking the President out of the White House so he could entertain his harlots at the local Marriott), yet the author presents enough firsthand information to make any reader question the competence and integrity of the new administration in town.  UNLIMITED ACCESS is a refreshing \\"blast from the past,\\" a reminder of the goofiness that was in power for eight years, and a sigh of relief that our nation no longer has to endure such embarrassment.r has to endure such embarrassment.	2003-04-15

Michener's works, and CENTENNIAL is by far my favorite from this gifted author.  In fact, I've read this book twice, which is no small task, given its 900-plus pages.<br />CENTENNIAL is about a fictitious town of the same name in Colorado.  The town is not nestled in the majestic Rockies, as one might expect, but instead is located out on the vast, open, treeless, windswept plains that run down from the eastern slopes of the mountains.  It is here, at the nexus of two radically diverse land masses, that Michener gives the reader a comprehensive history of the area, from the formation of the land and its rivers, to its prehistoric inhabitants, to its early settlers, to its subsequent clash of various cultures.  The plains Indians, fur trappers, pioneer settlers, soldiers, ranchers, dry land and irrigation farmers, and the hearty  descendents of these diverse groups--all are depicted vividly and weaved into an engrossing story by an author with a keen eye for detail.<br />CENTENNIAL furnishes an impressive assortment of powerful, unforgettable characters:  Lame Beaver, an Arapaho chieftan; Pasquinel, a French fur trapper; pioneer Levi Zendt; trail boss R.J. Poteet; ranchers Jim and Charlotte Lloyd; and many more.  Through these characters the reader is given an epic tale of the American West, a tale that is beautiful, compelling, profound, and often tragic.  CENTENNIAL is higly recommended to any student of the American West, or to any lover of epic literature.	2003-04-01

A friendly chat with a neighbor, a casual gathering at the pub.  A place of quiet satisfaction--a place to rest and relax after a busy day of work in the angry city.  Ah, Suburbia.<br />Leslie Thomas reveals a little tarnish on this shining image through his hilarious novel, TROPIC OF RUISLIP.  While Plummers Park Estate, a sprawling London suburb, may look peaceful and serene to the casual eye, it is anything but to its hurried, worried, self-indulged inhabitants.  Under the sea of flat-roofed houses, there is marital strife, discord, envy, infidelity, insanity, and a host of other dysfunctions.  Plummers Park has it all:  dogs chasing and mauling the local taxidermist, an onion salesman peddling more than his wares to bored housewifes, sexual trysts in the most unusual places, eccentric artists--even a flasher.<br />Andrew Maiby, a reporter for a local weekly newspaper, is indicative of \\"Flat-Roof Man.\\"  He has a wife and daughter, a steady job and good friends, and an itch that he simply cannot scratch.  Middle age is approaching, and Andrew is restless.  And bored--bored with the foolish hypocrisy that is Plummers Park.  Unexpectedly--quite out of the blue--something happens to Andrew to break up the monotony of his life.  The subsequent results are hysterical.<br />Thomas is a master at writing comic dialogue; his pacing, his timing, are flawless.  The reader will be laughing out loud as he or she busily turns the pages of this little gem.  TROPIC OF RUISLIP is enthusiastically recommended.	2003-03-04

Ted Nugent is a refreshing, hardnosed icon of rugged individualism: the antithesis of the whining, socialistic activism running rampant in today's entertainment industry. When making an appearance on one of the cable talk shows, his no-nonsense, pull-no-punches conservativism usually leaves his liberal antagonist speechless, gaping for air like a fish out of water.<br />GOD, GUNS & ROCK 'N ROLL is Nugent's conservative manifesto. His love for hunting--for relishing the right to own guns--is revealed time after time, page after page. I'm not much of a hunter myself (don't have the patience for it), but I do possess unflinching admiration for the outdoorsmen of our society. And I'll defend to the death their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.<br />This book is pure Nugent-speak; you can practically hear him talk as you read the words. GOD, GUNS & ROCK 'N ROLL is more than worthy to take its place in anyone's conservative book collection.<br />--D. Mikels	2003-02-27

How can this be?  Because Mr. Zubry virtually extends his hand in warm greetings from the pages of his wonderful book, MILES OF EXPERIENCE.<br />Zubry writes in a soothing, conversational style--as if he had pulled up a chair next to you in front of the fireplace to engage in a friendly chat.  I heard his Russian accent as I read his stories, stories about his childhood in the former Soviet Union, stories about distant lands and distant cultures, stories about persecution, corruption, intolerance.  Most of his stories do not have happy endings, yet the reader still treasures them--still treasures the author for presenting them in such a warm, humanistic manner.<br />By far, my favorite story (although I enjoyed them all) was \\"Russian Dedication.\\"  Zubry provides a hilarious, yet biting, account of a construction project gone awry to demonstrate the hopeless inefficiency and corruption of the former Soviet Republic.  It is more than apparent the author has a genuine love for his homeland and its people, but cared nothing for the Communist government.  In fact, Zubry renounced his Soviet citizenship in 1978 and became a U.S. citizen in 1984.<br />Russia's loss is America's gain.<br />MILES OF EXPERIENCE is highly recommended.  As I mentioned earlier, you will get to know Boris Zubry through the pages of this book, and you'll be proud and honored to consider him a friend.	2003-02-20

It is the hallmark of several faiths, the subject of countless sermons.  But what would happen if Christ returned to our hopelessly divided society as a quiet, softspoken man?  Louis N. Gruber provides an intriguing answer to this question in his novel, JAY:  A SPIRITUAL FANTASY.<br />Suffice it to say that today's theological world is as intolerant and inflexible as the scowling Pharises of 2,000 years ago.  Gruber explores this intolerance in his book.  When Jay Sonneman calls together a diverse group of clergy to preach love and inclusion--of all faiths, lifestyles, viewpoints--the religious \\"establishment\\" is shook to its very foundation.  How could this man be tolerant of any faith other than Christianity?  How dare he reach out to gays?  To not condemn sin strongly enough?  How dare he minimalize the many denominations that worship in his name?<br />And the stage is set, history is repeated.  Persecution:  of Jay, and his followers.<br />This book is unique; it reads more like a dialogue between Jay and his followers, less like a conventional novel.  That, I think, was the author's intent.  There is little character development, and Gruber should work on weaving more detail into his writing.  That said, JAY:  A SPIRITUAL FANTASY is recommended for its ability to move the reader to think.  I give five stars for the story, three for the writing.	2003-01-27

And Debbie Lee Wesselmann, a talented and gifted writer, takes what in my opinion is a superficially interesting story and makes it eminently readable and enjoyable.<br />TRUTOR &amp; THE BALLOONIST tells the story of an &quot;odd couple&quot; in every sense of the word:  Michelle Trutor, a young researcher who has left her abusive boyfriend behind, and her curious friendship with Arthur Wharton (known affectionately to Trutor as &quot;the Balloonist&quot;), an aging attorney from a most eccentric New England family.  The Balloonist enlists the aid of Trutor to unravel the complex secrets and riddles of his late sister Caroline, who has handcuffed her surviving heirs with a bizarre will, guarded by a pit bull of an attorney.  Trutor proves to be a most effective sleuth; in fact, her uncanny ability to decipher riddles, connect the dots, and put the proverbial pieces of the puzzle together very gently flirts with suspension of disbelief.  Suffice it to say that Caroline Wharton was a complex, perhaps cruel, individual, and when the story is finally resolved the reader will raise his/her eyebrows.<br />Ms. Wesselmann has a supreme knack for detail; her descriptions of nature, of the quaint New England town where the Whartons reside, are dazzling, almost magical.  The pacing of this book is wonderful, flawless.  TRUTOR &amp; THE BALLOONIST is from an author who is hitting her stride--an author to be reckoned with.	2003-01-13

Tolkien creates another world--indeed, another culture and language--in what many consider the greatest novel of the 20th Century, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  A sweeping, all-encompassing tale of a make-believe world, LOTR is the product of an imagination that may never be equalled again.<br />THE TWO TOWERS, the second part of Tolkien's LOTR trilogy, takes the reader on a remarkable, almost breathless journey:  chasing orcs who have captured Merry and Pippen; galloping across the plains of Rohan with Riders of the Rohirrim; the bloody battle of Helm's Deep; the vast wasteland of Isengard; the perilous journey of Frodo and Sam to the borders of Mordor, accompanied by a most unlikely ally.  Unlike \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" Tolkien's first installment, which at times was compelled to slow to a snail's pace to patiently set up the story, THE TWO TOWERS moves the reader along at a rapid clip, from the first page to the last.<br />Here we are also introduced to a rich variety of new characters:  Eomer, King Theoden, the evil Wormtongue, Treebeard the Ent, Faramir of Gondor, and a nasty assortment of snarling orcs.  Tolkien's mastery of the written word brings these characters, and the places of Middle-earth they inhabit--to colorful life.  The rich imagery he creates is unsurpassed; THE TWO TOWERS is storytelling unsurpassed.  Highly recommended.	2002-11-27

LET FREEDOM RING primarily recycles the same pertinent arguments conservatives have put forth since the Reagan years, but Hannity's style is fresh and vigorous.  Watch but one episode of \\"Hannity & Colmes\\" on Fox News Channel and you'll be overwhelmed with the amount of passion Hannity brings to the table.<br />Make no mistake:  our culture is waging an idealistic war over the confrontation of ideas.  The left has succeeded in hijacking our societal mainstream, from media and entertainment to our colleges and universities.  Political correctness has achieved status quo, complete with speech codes, environmental hysteria, gender-neutral armed forces, and the taking of an unborn child for the sake of expediency.  These are titanic issues our society must face--whether to return to a free society based on rugged individualism or to continue our relentless march into a welfare state with its monolithic Big Brother.  Hannity brings a new conservative voice to the debate, a voice that is most welcome.	2002-11-18

Masterfully written.<br />J.R.R. Tolkien creates another world--indeed, another culture and language--in what many consider the greatest novel of the 20th Century, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"  A sweeping, all-encompassing tale of a make-believe world, LOTR is the product of an imagination that may never be equalled again.<br />And Tolkien's story evolves--parallel to the turbulent and terrible years of World War II, when he was working on Part 1, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.  The book, as it progresses, takes on a darker, more ominous tone, a reflection of the inherent danger manifesting itself in Great Britain under a relentless Nazi attack.<br />THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING begins in a lighthearted, almost whimsical fashion, much like Tolkien's prequel, \\"The Hobbit.\\"  Case in point:  Tom Bombadil.  When Frodo and fellow companions Sam, Merry, and Pippin are bewitched by a menacing willow in the Old Forest that has magical powers, Tom Bombadil bursts onto the scene spouting poetry, saving the day.  Better yet, when Frodo and his friends fall victim to the Barrow Wights, Frodo recites a poem that instantly brings Bombadil to the rescue.  This is fairy tale prose, very much like the tone from \\"The Hobbit,\\" where even when a character is in danger there is no sense of doom or foreboding.<br />And yet, the story evolves, because Frodo's quest becomes more dangerous, disturbing.  From the attack at Weathertop, to the confrontation with the Nazgul at the Ford, to the Council of Elrond, the crossing of the Mines of Moria, the imposing majesty of the Argonath, to the breaking of the Fellowship at Parth Galen on the banks of the Anduin, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING becomes a sweeping, vivid account of Frodo's journey to destroy the Ring--to save Middle-earth.<br />Hobbits, elves, dwarves, men, wizards, orcs...Tolkien gives us a rich fantasy world that is as believable as it is dangerous.  Enriched by its similarities to medieval lore, this is storytelling unsurpassed.  Highly, highly recommended.unsurpassed.  Highly, highly recommended.	2002-10-18

Tolkien's The Hobbit	Books	4	2	4	N	N	A Grand Children's Tale	Lacking the intensity and pathos of the epic sequel, &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien's THE HOBBIT is a light, whimsical fantasy tale for children.  Brightly cloaked dwarves with names like Balin, Dwalin, Bifor, Bofur, Fili, Kili...bumbling cave trolls tricked by the wizard Gandalf into arguing until sunrise, causing their subsequent demise...a contest of riddles between protagonist Bilbo Baggins and the creature Gollum deep under the Misty Mountains...the trek to the Lonely Mountain, guarded by Smaug, a fire-breathing dragon...and the story itself, often narrarated by the author in the first person...all contribute to this lighthearted novel.  Conventional wisdom has it that Tolkien wrote the book to entertain his young son, Christopher; in doing so, he has effectively entertained millions through the generations.<br />THE HOBBIT lays the foundation for &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; for here the reader shares Bilbo's discovery of the one Ring, the essential component that drives the story of Tolkien's Middle-earth trilogy.  And through the pages of THE HOBBIT, the reader is introduced to a sweeping make-believe world, delivered by an author with fluid, even magical prose.	2002-10-08

If indeed these two nineteen-year-old greenhorn Rangers survived the never-ending onslaught of bloodthirsty Indians and the harsh environment of the Old West--while seasoned and battle-tested men all around them drop like flies--then they should have abruptly left law enforcement and become priests.<br />Total suspension of credibility is the theme of this book, culminating in the improbable, laugh-out-loud climactic scene, when an English lady suffering from leprosy strips naked and wraps a boa constrictor around her shoulders and rides a white horse through a band of savage Comanches.  (See what I mean?)<br />McMurtry is a master storyteller, and LONESOME DOVE is as good as it gets, but this prequel misses the mark by a country mile.	2002-09-23

I didn't have that built-in \\"bias\\" of hoping beyond hope that McMurtry would offer a sequel as mesmerizing as his Pulitizer-prize winning masterpiece--a bias that seems to have disappointed so many of the reviewers on this site who can't help but compare the two books.<br />Fact is, this is a gripping, brutal Western. STREETS OF LAREDO gives the reader a vast array of complex, interesting characters: Woodrow F. Call, the aging former lawman turned bounty hunter, who realizes he is well past his prime...Pea Eye Parker, torn between his devotion to his family and his undying loyalty to Call...Lorena Parker, once a prostitute, now a wife, mother, and schoolteacher, who sets out in the face of overwhelming danger to find her husband...Mr. Brookshire, a railroad accountant from New York and traveling companion of Call, who is appalled at the brutality of the West...Maria, whose hatred of Call and concern for her killer son cannot overcome a true heart of gold. Throw in two chilling, ruthless killers--Joey Garza and Mox Mox, the \\"manburner\\"--and you've got a story that keeps the reader busily turning pages.<br />This is a hardhitting, well-written account of the Old West in the last gasp of the 19th century. The book stands alone on its own merits.	2002-09-20

Alice Sebold's moving account of a 14-year-old girl's metaphysical oddysey following her brutal murder evokes more questions than answers.<br />The protagonist, Susie Salmon, gives us a first-person account of her death, her experience in Heaven, and the lingering effect of her death on her family with a detached aloofness that often suspends credibility.  How...how on earth...can this tragic character relate the events of the story with such emotional sterility?  It's as if another person were killed, and Susie is giving us the grisly aftermath as an objective reporter.  Her transcendental afterlife, as she moves freely between Heaven and earth, rings hollow, almost purgatorial:  there is an inconsistent lack of an emotional investment.<br />That said, Alice Sebold provides a haunting, well-written narrative.  Good, but less than satisfying.	2002-09-11

Or better yet, late of an evening I love pulling my worn copy of this book off my shelf, opening it at random, and begin reading. In seconds, I am once again immersed in McMurtry's epic, timeless story.<br />Yes, the Old West is vividly recreated in this book. You can almost feel the pain of a horse bite, smell biscuits cooked over hot coals, see Gus throw a dead rattlesnake off the front porch to two hungry pigs. These images are ingrained through writing and storytelling from an author at the pinnacle of his craft. But McMurtry does more--so much more--than give his readers a boot-stompin' Western: he tells a story about human relationships that transcends time and culture. Gus and Call, so different, so indispensable to one another, forge a lifelong partnership and friendship that most marriages fail to duplicate. The two ex-Rangers' undying loyalty and devotion to the other is the driving force behind the novel. (How many of us would follow through with our best friend's request to be hauled 3,000 miles for burial?)<br />Read this book. Again and again.

For me, SANTA STEPS OUT evoked the latter, as Devereaux sends his story into an abyss of nonsense--much like the demise of the TV series \\"Happy Days,\\" when Fonzie jumped the shark during that fateful and ridiculous episode.<br />Three stars go to the author.  In a word, Devereaux can flat out write; his prose is fluent and majestic, metaphorically the equal of rushing waters down the Falls of Rauros, set against the steep austerity of the hills of Emyn Muil.  But all of the author's skills, and they are considerable, cannot salvage a story that starts and stays out of control.<br />Granted, the story on its face is preposterous--the sexual escapades and subsequent dysfunction of Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny--and I knew that before I picked up the book.  But can such a story, one as gawdy and irreverent as this one, be salvageable?  Sure.  But SANTA STEPS OUT doesn't have a direction or purpose or message:  only chaos.  And the book blindly \\"jumps the shark\\" when Anya (Mrs. Claus), decides to seek vengeance on her unfaithful mate by wrapping herself in \\"magic time\\" and having sex with hundreds of Santa's elves.  Laughable?  Yes.  Believable (based on the previous portrayal of this character)?  Uh, no.<br />But such, alas, is the fate of SANTA STEPS OUT, as Devereaux's characters are woefully inconsistent from paragragh to paragraph, let alone chapter to chapter.  And despite writing that can only be labeled as superb, this story dissolves into absolute goofiness.	2002-05-28

And the first of the book doesn't disappoint, as Ketchum masterfully sets the stage for pending disaster, develops the plot and inserts interesting sub-plots of tension and conflict among all of his characters.  The table is set for a grand seat-squirmer...<br />...and then the book goes over the top.  Do you remember the scene from the movie, \\"The Shining,\\" the scene where the elevator doors open and a river of blood comes cascading out to bathe the lobby with gallons and gallons of crimson?  Such is the case with LADIES NIGHT, as horror and suspense are carelessly cast aside in favor of mindless gore, gore, and more gore.  Halfway through the book the reader becomes so desensitized to all the blood and guts it is impossible to care what happens to the characters.  Instead of being wrapped in the story, I found myself chuckling after each grisly scene, asking myself, \\"OK, what kind of mutilation are we going to see next?\\"  Ketchum is, if nothing else, imaginative when it comes to chopping, stabbing, smashing, cleaving (insert any verb you want) people to pieces.<br />I take back my earlier statement:  this is a seat-squirmer, but only because of the discomfort caused by all the glaring typos and inept editing.  (It would appear that the copy editors at Gauntlet have never heard of a comma, colon, or semi-colon.)  Save your money if you're wanting a nailbiter:  LADIES NIGHT starts off with much promise then fizzles into a bloodsoaked whimper.	2002-04-22

First-time author Regina Poleondakis tells a warm, heart-rending story about a young woman desperately trying to come to grips with unspeakable tragedy. Picking up the pieces of her life, she moves back to her hometown in Alabama, a setting that puts her back in touch with her mother, her best friend, and a man from her past. The characters are real, the feelings are real, and the story is tender and compelling.<br /><br />I normally don't get into \\"chick\\" books, but BEFORE I WAKE piqued my curiosity because it is so well written by a first-time author.
