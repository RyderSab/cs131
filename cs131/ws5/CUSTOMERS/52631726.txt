As a business owner for nearly two decades, I am always on the hunt for a great new business book. Many hit narrow points, but few encompass a concept and wrap it with sound writing skills communicating the concept clearly and succinctly. In BAG THE ELEPHANT, Steve Kaplan has quite successfully captured the latter. <br /> <br />For those not oriented toward this type of jargon, an \\"Elephant\\" has, for many years, been the synonym for a large client/customer. In my field, consulting, obtaining an elephant client is daunting, difficult, exciting, and more than anything else, a helluva challenge. However, the potential rewards are incredible. (NOTE: I am not a major proponent of a business built around a couple of elephants or a handful of smaller elephants. The simple reason is attrition; it happens to everyone and if your clientele numbers are few, the departure of one elephant can cause extreme hardship on the basic operations of one's business. My advice is to build a client base with many small-to-medium size clients and sprinkle in an elephant or two once your foundation is established. Attrition is much more palatable under these circumstances.) <br /> <br />As noted, Kaplan has effectively and succinctly described his concept of bagging an elephant. His basic premise outlines various strategies for business owners seeking to enter the realm of the larger client/customer (i.e. the elephants). Kaplan divides the book into five parts, which effectively and humorously, describes the process of bagging the elephant: <br /> <br />Part I - \\"Your Elephant is Waiting\\" - Kaplan describes various strategies for aligning your business with elephants, and how to gauge success in obtaining an elephant.  <br /> <br />Part II - \\"What to know about Elephants\\" - Kaplan compares and contrasts the characteristics and attributes of small and large businesses, and describes the challenges of bridging the gap between the two (i.e. cutting through the bureaucratic red tape). <br /> <br/>Part III - \\"Romancing your Elephant\\" - Kaplan describes various methods of getting one's foot in the corporate door. This is handled quite effectively with a graphical flow chart of procedural \\"to dos.\\" <br /> <br />Part IV - \\"Leveraging your Elephant's Power\\" - Kaplan lays out a conceptual plan to keep your elephant once you've gotten it. This is probably one of the more important sections (concepts) in the book as this is the final litmus test of your business's ability to handle, on an ongoing basis, the daily trials of dealing with a larger business. Inasmuch as the corporate cultures will be disparate, the small business owner must become a chameleon. <br /> <br />Part V - \\"Five Killer Mistakes\\" - Read this section very carefully. If you've been in business long enough, you may know each of these personally. <br /> <br />All in all, Kaplan has successfully captured the essence and nuances of being David in a Goliath arena. This is quite simply daunting however, simple reminders of why one decided upon entrepreneurship vs. the corporate life will present a grounding effect for the seemingly insurmountable task of bagging an elephant. This is a great book for any business owner. Highly recommended. <br />	2005-09-16
US	52631726	R2N7ORR3GBR074	0060875410	122518901	The FairTax Book	Books	1	26	68	N	N	Unfortunately, the authors presentation is fatally flawed.	I read the FAIRTAX BOOK with some hope that Boortz and Linder would enlighten me as to how a consumption tax could replace the current tax revenues generated by the plethora of tax platforms it would replace (i.e. income tax, social security/Medicare tax, gift tax, estate tax, etc.). I had hoped that not only would they expound on the DETAIL of this bill (H.R. 25), but actually show some simple (or complex) calculations. I had hoped they cold validate the actual reasoning, without \\"politicking.\\" Unfortunately, none of these hopes reached any level of fruition. <br /> <br />Before you go any further, this review will be contrary to the overwhelming lovefest of this book evidenced by the 4- and 5-star reviews however, I am going to back it up with specific reflections of the flaws stated in the book and the page numbers on which these flaws exist. If one is not interested in believing the flaws in the book and in the platform being advanced by the FairTax movement, don't read any further, but please read this next paragraph. <br /> <br />Before you begin believing blindly that the FairTax is the only way to go, ask yourself this question: does it bother you that the authors give absolutely NO evidence that a 23% consumption tax will actually replace the federal revenues generated by the current tax structures? They \\"say\\" 23% is all it will take, but do they show us a calculation? Do they cite a study? Do they do ANYTHING demonstrative to back up their claims? No, no, and no. Their entire justification for the FairTax is built around rhetoric ONLY. They don't compare contrast calculations. They don't even put forth the gross dollars we're talking about here. What they do instead is say [paraphrasing], \\"The FairTax idea is so simple, this book didn't need to be very long.\\" Well, if you're just going to say, \\"My idea works, but I'm not going to prove it to you,\\" then I agree, your argument doesn't need to be longwinded. <br /> <br />Let's begin: <br /> <br />Page 33 - the authors describe a fictional corporation paying $100,000 in corporate income tax and begin consider the possibilities. In their first possibility (#1.), they say the $100,000 income tax could be paid out of the $2 million profit, but \\"see who's picking up the income tax now? The shareholders, not the corporation.\\" FLAWED. If this fictional corporation had pretax profits of $2 million, it would have to do one of two things: 1) pay corporate income tax, at a maximum rate of 35% (you can do the math here), or 2) pay it to the shareholders in the form of dividends, in which case the shareholders pay 15% income tax (tax on dividends is qualified at 15% for individuals), AND pay corporate income tax (since dividends are considered a deduction to corporations). <br /> <br />Page 42 (last paragraph) - \\"Have you ever stopped to calculate just how much money you lose each year because you have to make financial and business decisions aimed at reducing your tax obligations?\\" FLAWED. If I have to stop and contemplate EVERY PURCHASE I make because the consumption tax of, say, 30% (23% Federal FairTax and assuming 7% state consumption (sales) tax), that will cost me much more time than considering the income tax effects of these same decisions. Example: I don't consider the income tax obligation of purchasing a new car, but I damn sure would if I had to pay a 30% consumption tax. <br /> <br />Pages 49 - 50 - \\"...try to imagine what it would be like for a business owner or a corporate board of directors to contemplate a business expansion or other business move without having to give a second thought to the tax implications...\\" In this section, the authors are describing the costs associated with complying with the income tax code, and setting the stage for it flawed embedded cost argument. FLAWED. Instead of a business owner or corporate board of directors spending time contemplating the income tax effects of a business expansion or business move, they will instead contemplatethe effects of the consumption tax on these same decisions and the potentially incredible amount of additional IMMEDIATE cash flow it will cost them to fund these decisions. I submit that in many cases, the cost of these decisions could actually go up as a business owner might have to fund a portion of the decisions (business expansion or other business move) by seeking a bank loan. <br /> <br />Page 50 - \\"And as for you, the individual? Your tax compliance costs drop to absolutely nothing.\\" FLAWED. Are they kidding? When you begin to consider that brand new car you've been thirsting for, do you think you're not going to begin to consider the additional cost in the form of federal AND state consumption taxes, and how much more it is going to cost you? You're only fooling yourself; this will become a major decision and will definitely cost you time and money. (I know, \\"but the embedded tax will be removed and the car will still cost the same!\\" I'll pour water on this argument shortly.) <br /> <br />Pages 52 - 55 - the authors begin to discuss the concept of the \\"the embedded costs\\" in every commercial good consumers purchase. Yes, without any doubt, there are embedded costs, but that is simply Business 101. The costs they target are embedded tax/compliance costs, and they quote a study by Dr. Dale Jorgenson indicating the various \\"embedded costs of the tax code\\" in a variety of industries/goods. The problem with their presentation of this information is that Jorgenson's study was based on PRODUCER pricing, not CONSUMER pricing. Big difference here. (See page 59 - \\"Since PRODUCERS would no longer pay taxes on wages...prices received by PRODUCERS...\\" Producer pricing, not consumer pricing.) FLAWED. As I discussed above, the authors indicate there will be no compliance costs to businesses associated with the FairTax. Also as I indicate above, this is a bogus statement. Every purchase over a certain amount will cause pause and consternation to determine if 1) the item isreally needed now, 2) can I afford the additional costs in the form of a federal AND state consumption tax, and 3) how will I fund this purchase if I don't have the cash on hand? No, their argument is fatally flawed. The \\"compliance\\" costs for businesses will still be there; thus, the embedded costs the authors describe will still be there as well. Not only that, but this is very important to understand: BUSINESSES WILL HAVE TO FILL OUT SOME FORM OF CONSUMPTION TAX FORM DETAILING THEIR COLLECTIONS, AND FILE AND REPORT THEM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. DOESN'T THIS REPRESENT COMPLIANCE AND WILL BECOME AN EMBEDDED COST? If so, then the authors contention that the FairTax will rid us all of embedded costs is fatally flawed on its face. (Disclosure: under the FairTax, approximately 7.65% of the embedded costs would evaporate in the form of social security/Medicare matching tax paid by employers. However, the costs of compliance with the FairTax have not been studied or disclosed by the authors therefore, we do not a reasonable basis for comparing what the NEW embedded costs will be. Has anyone paused to think: could the embedded costs actually be more under the FairTax simply due to the incredible amount of time a business owner will have to take to make decisions over a large purchase?) <br /> <br />Pages 56 - 57 - the authors discuss the possibility of the embedded taxes \\"disappearing\\" and ALL businesses reducing their retail pricing by that same amount. FLAWED. Are they kidding? First, I've already proven that there will still be embedded costs (perhaps even MORE), but more than that, do you really think that across the board, without fail, every single retail business, doctor, attorney, accountant, engineer, etc. in the entire U.S. is going to reduce their retail pricing by the amount saved from embedded tax cost removal, if ANY? That is a ludicrous, self-serving statement, and it will never happen. Capitalism is too lucrative and attractive, and profits are the maingoal of every business.  <br /> <br />Page 77 - \\"As already stated, the tax will be levied against all goods and services. Yes, you will pay a tax to your doctor. In fact, approximately 26 percent of the money you pay the doctor today represents the embedded cost of the tax system-so look for your doctor's fees to go down by as much as, if not more than, the amount of the consumption tax he will collect.\\" FLAWED. First, as I've already PROVEN, there will still be embedded costs in complying with the FairTax, and this may actually become a greater cost to someone like a doctor who has never had to collect a tax like this (unlike your grocer or hardware store). Second, doctors are screaming right now at the cut in fees they've had to take due to insurance reimbursement mandates. Do you really think if they have a chance to make some of this reduced reimbursement back, they won't take it? You're fooling yourself if you believe this. Third, if the costs of health care go up, what happens to our already overburdened healthcare system and the insurance sharks (companies) who continually raise our medical insurance premiums and cut our benefits? Do you think this won't continue, but now, at a much greater rate due to the increased costs placed on doctors? Again, you're fooling yourself if you believe this tripe. <br /> <br />Page 106 - \\"Economists estimate that in the first year after the FairTax Act becomes law, the economy will grow by 10.5 percent.\\" FLAWED. Notice how the authors say \\"Economists,\\" but never say what economists or cite a study giving proof of this statement? Does this bother you? Doesn't believing this just because they say it (without a proven study) make us lemmings? Go back to page 7 of the book where the authors describe the vice president of the National Retail Sales Federation (this is the organization representing all retail sales entities). The National Retail Sales Federation is AGAINST the FairTax. Now, if the FairTax was going to grow the economy by 10.5% in the very first year after enactment, don't you think the National organization representing retail sales entities would be all for the FairTax? Don't you think they'd be spending advertising and lobbying dollars to get the FairTax enacted? You've got to ask yourself why the retailers, who supposedly will benefit from the FairTax, are then against it. And, if retailers fear that, in actuality, retail sales will suffer because of the added consumption tax, and the result is consumers dramatically slow their spending, how will this do anything but oppress economic growth?  <br /> <br />Page 148 - the authors describe how the 23% FairTax rate was decided upon. \\"The researchers and analysts concluded that we would need an inclusive sales tax rate of 23 percent.\\" Okay, show the calculation of why 23% works. Show me the simple math of how 23% replaces all the current tax revenues. FLAWED. They NEVER show the proof that it will work. <br /> <br />If Amazon allowed more space, I would continue. Suffice it to say, I found this book full of flaws, making it, in my mind, a fatally flawed concept and idea.  <br /> <br />It is my contention that a consumption tax \\"could\\" work, but ONLY if the out-of-control spending habits of our federal government are reduced significantly. I believe they would have to be reduced by law for it to reflect a permanent reduction and then, and only then, could a consumption tax be considered to be effective. There will still be problems with the FairTax, as there would any tax structure, but it would be more effective with government-controlled spending. <br /> <br />Conceptually, the FairTax has merit and some promise, but the way the authors present this platform with smoke and mirrors and disingenuous rhetoric, makes me very wary and quite dubious. The FairTax concept rates 3 stars, the book, with its half-truths and deception rates 1 star. <br />	2005-09-09

I have been a fan of this series since the beginning, and like many of the reviewers here, I want to expect the best when a new offering arrives in the mail. His last few have been fair, but without the punch of the first PREY iterations. With the publishing of BROKEN PREY, Sandford takes a step back in the right direction. Although somewhat sloppy and disjointed at the end, BROKEN PREY is solid.  <br /> <br />For those unindoctrinated, Lucas Davenport is the hero is Sandford's PREY series. He has gone from a \\"tough as nails\\" detective to his current position of investigator in the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. While this sounds sexy, it is basically an internal investigatory body directed by the governor.  <br /> <br />As the story begins, the body of a young woman is discovered, her body mutilated in macabre and grotesque manner. Soon thereafter, Davenport receives a call from a sheriff in a small Minnesota town indicating that someone had killed two people, a child and his father. The details of the father's death leave Lucas realizing he might just have a serial killer running around the Twin Cities. The father had been sodomized and mutilated in the same fashion as the first victim.  <br /> <br />Davenport's investigation leads him to the St. John's Mental Hospital where he is told his prime suspect was very close and a disciple of \\"The Big Three.\\" The Big Three are three particularly perverse, violent, masochistic men who have murdered many for the sport of it. Think \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" when Clarice visits Lector at the asylum...the thoughts are horrendous.  Lucas takes very little from the interview with the Big Three, yet there is something gnawing at him that he can't quite pinpoint.  <br /> <br />This bizarre and unprecedented string of murders continues until a strong climax toward the end of the book. I say \\"toward the end of the book\\" because once the identity of the murderer is known, the chase to capture the murderer, while exciting, is something less in passion than the search to find the murderer. Thus, while one will feel the story building to a brilliant crescendo, the climax comes a bit too soon in relation to the book's end. Picky, I know, but it was distracting.  <br /> <br />Regardless the somewhat disjointed ending, Sandford has regained his \\"punch\\" of capturing the reader early and holding him. While this book is somewhat over-the-top in terms of descriptive violence, it is current in the types of headlines we see on a daily basis.  <br /> <br />On a lighter note, one of the back stories in BROKEN PREY is Lucas's search for the 100 greatest Rock `n Roll songs of all time. He has received a new iPod as a gift and only wants to put the best on the device. The breaks in the main story to uncover these gems are quite refreshing and fun. And, Sandford leaves the reader with a surprise appendix...no, I'll not tell; just read the book!  Overall, this is a return of Sandford's PREY series. <br />	2005-08-13

Woodward must have felt like his feet were swept out from under him. Like he has done so many times in the past, this time, Woodward himself was scooped. And, by none other than Deep Throat himself. Well, not exactly Deep Throat, but rather, by his family and the family attorney.<br /><br />For decades, the suspense about who Deep Throat was and what his/her motivations were surrounded all those fascinated by Watergate. There are ponderous numbers of books by Watergate felons as well as by the journalists who covered it. The most dramatic (and best, in my opinion) of these offerings was ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, which became quite a successful movie as well. This latest iteration, THE SECRET MAN, was less than expected, but, as it is the culmination of 3 decades of specultation and wonder, it still rates 4 stars.<br /><br />Woodward describes how he met Mark Felt a/k/a Deep Throat, and how he developed the relationship that would become one of the most famous reporter/source relationships in history. He describes what he feels Felt's motivations and reasonings were, which can be found, in part, in Felt's own book, THE FBI PYRAMID (which is out of print, but an original copy is for sale on Amazon for a mere $1,995!). Felt was snubbed for the top FBI job by the Nixon administration when J. Edgar Hoover died. As the #2 man at FBI, Felt believed he would be the successor to Hoover, but instead, Nixon put one of \\"his men\\" in the spot, Patrick Gray. Woodward (and Felt) describe Gray as a patsy for Nixon, actually being a parallel, secondary leak of FBI information to the White House. So, while Felt was offering information and guidance to Woodward and the Washington Post, Gray was providing much the same to the Nixon White House. The FBI was a veritable sieve. One can only speculate if Felt was attempting a veiled level of revenge against Nixon for the snub. While this is somewhat mitigated by what Woodward reports, it still makes one wonder.<br /><br />Woodward, finally, describes the settings of his clandestine meetings with Felt, how they took place, when they took place, and where they took place. He describes Felt's demeanor and posture in these meetings, and the overriding message Woodward took from each session. The thing that was disappointing to this Watergate junkie was the lack of detail. With the outing of Felt as Deep Throat by the Felt family (as opposed to Woodward and his journalistic partner at the time, Carl Bernstein), THE SECRET MAN read like a rush to the printer. The book, very short by Woodward standards, did not provide the level of detail one would expect when this story finally broke. I can only surmise that Woodward and his advisors wanted to hit the story while it was still hot, thus making the book somewhat impotent as to detail.<br /><br />Felt, who is now in the serious stages of dementia, barely remembers Woodward, doesn't remember significant names, doesn't remember significant events, and doesn't remember the secret meetings with Woodward. While disheartening to a Watergate groupie, this story leaves one with a certain level of consternation. And we're not the only ones...Woodward himself admits to this same consternation. Another interesting revelation, Woodward's writing tone is almost apologetic. Apologetic to those he \\"lied\\" to in an effort to continue to keep his promise of anonymity to Felt, and apologetic to Felt.<br /><br />In the end, the book is necessary and good, but is way too short to really satisfy the thirst of this reviewer.<br />Woodward, finally, describes the settings of his clandestine meetings with Felt, how they took place, when they took place, and where they took place.

His first offering, WALL STREET MEAT, was rife with hilarious tales. In this offering, RUNNING MONEY, Kessler takes on the ostensible task of writing about operating a hedge fund, its challenges, and rewards. <br /> <br />Kessler offers many stories of his exploits of attempting to bootstrap this business and the trevails of raising money for hedge funds. A recurring story (theme) revolves around his \\"mentor,\\" Mr. Zed. Mr. Zed leads Kessler down the path of introspection and discovery, attempting to teach Kessler a valuable lesson with each conversation. Zed will never \\"give\\" Kessler the answer he seeks; rather, he asks questions to Kessler's questions. This type of learning is valuable, as Kessler soon discovers. In the end, Kessler's treatise regarding his culmination of learning from Mr. Zed is enlightening. <br /> <br />Now, as I mentioned in my title, this book has the style, which if Kessler is writing, most likely will always be there. However, that said, the overall evaluation of content was borderline. While the reader may expect direction and some detail about actually running a hedge fund, Kessler devotes three chapters on the development of the steam engine (there are a few other inane chapters as well). The purpose of this allocation of chapter material is not historical in nature necessarily (although those totally clueless to the development of the steam engine will learn something), rather, it is an investment lesson. Kessler describes the economic and financial markets (as they were) at the time of this invention, and brings it current by posing the question of investment in the company (Boulton and Watt) who developed and had a 25-year patent on the first steam engine. The story RE: development was monotonous; the overriding question of investment, spot on. Still, in this reviewer's opinion, the gross departure to historical analogies detracted from the content.  <br /> <br />Kessler's discussion of scale is fascinating. He tells the story of Elantec, a company making laser diode drivers necessary to the operation of rewritable CDs/DVDs. Kessler surmises this will be huge. As he and his partner begin a series of incremental investments in Elantec between $3 to $5, Kessler awaits the pop he seeks, hopefully to the $10 level, which will \\"make his month\\" (hedge fund nomenclature). The stock languishes until one fairly insignificant advent occurs...Napster. While Napster made incredible headlines (not profits), it revolutionized the need for rewritable media,and thus, scaled the market demand from obscure need to viral levels. Net, net, Kessler sold out of Elantec at prices reaching $200 per share. <br /> <br />In the end, RUNNING MONEY is a fascinating book and is well told by Andy Kessler. It has its dead spots, which lend to the concepts Kessler espouses, but tediously so. While the reader will desire more detail of the hedge fund industry and its inner workings, RUNNING MONEY is a solid read.	2005-07-24

This will not be a long review, as debating this issue is like debating politics or religion however, I believe one key factor has been left out of this book, and out of the FairTax legislation. That is: What are they not telling me? <br /> <br />Very simply, what they are not telling us is that, based on the current studies, and given the current spending infrastructure, there is no way to replace the income/payroll/estate/gift taxes structure without a consumption tax approaching 30%. That said, add that to your state and local sales tax rates and, all of a sudden, the middle class income tax rates don't look so bad. <br /> <br />The primary issue here in not the income tax; the primary issue is a government who can't control its spending. If government spending was reduced, and reduced permanently, something like a consumption tax would make sense AND would be viable because you could then have a rate of around 20% at a national level. However, until that day occurs, the FairTax would have us going from the world's largest debtor to an Argentinian-type bankruptcy.  <br /> <br />Keep this idea intact, but realize that proponents of the FairTax are putting the cart before the horse. Lobby your congressman to put a stop to government waste and pork AND only then, once this is a reality, can a lobby for the FairTax have a fair chance.	2005-06-26

Its about time someone cut thru the esoteria	How many times have you read a phrase in a book, financial report, consultant's report, or technical journal that, when you finished, you asked, \\"What did that just say?\\" If this esoteric jargon drives you nuts, and makes you wonder why the author uses these terms/phrases, then WHY BUSINESS PEOPLE SPEAK LIKE IDIOTS: A BULLFIGHTERS GUIDE is a book to read. IDIOTS calls to task the disingenuous garbage many corporate types call \\"reporting.\\" Many just wanting to get by will drink the koolaid and allow these items to pass without exception.  <br /> <br />Fugere, Hardaway, Warshawsky are three consultants, \\"addicts\\" if you will, who have decided to get off the jargon-riddled bandwagon. They detail how generic corporate atmospheres have mutated business from one of communication and meaning to one of faux intellectual elitism. Those deriding this seemingly overwhelming problem have found that speaking to the masses is much easier when one tries NOT to speak Greek.  <br /> <br />The three authors, in an effort to spread the word virally, have created a software program called, appropriately, Bullfighter. The purpose of the program is to scour MS Word and PowerPoint documents to rid them of \\"jargon-mania.\\" <br /> <br />Every profession creates its own jargon so insiders can discuss their livelihoods in a form of esoteric shorthand. However, jargon becomes a problem when it is used to lord over others or make them feel inferior, Warshawsky said. <br /> <br />The authors have studied the reception to their concept by setting up shop in an ever-busy Starbucks to take a simple survey. They showed patrons one of two actual company writing samples: one was jargon-less, while the other was the typical junk-filled jargon-based smoke and mirrors. The authors asked the patrons to assign adjectives to each communiqu. The jargon-laden sample consistently earned words like \\"rude and obnoxious\\" while the clearly written one was called \\"energetic\\" and \\"friendly.\\" 'Nuff said. <br /> <br />In sum, this book cuts directly to the chase of the confusing, mind-numbing rhetoric, and offers an alternative. As one who reads legal and financial documents for a living, this book fits the bill, and none too soon. If you read these types of documents in your work or are just tired of the insanity of double-speak, pick this book up and read it.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />	2005-05-19

While my mathematics skills are sound, my interest and attention span to physics is minute. Regardless one's interest or attention span, Roger Penrose has penned a gem with THE ROAD TO REALITY.  <br /> <br />Penrose speaks somewhat in \\"magical\\" prose; reality becomes  magic and mystery. This, perhaps, is what makes those fearing/loathing math and physics a bit more open to the subjects. Penrose brings the reader along delicately, even with the headier subsets. That said, don't be fooled by this rosier picure; Penrose forges ahead with the tough stuff. However, it is understandable and even enjoyable (yes, enjoyable). <br /> <br />As several reviewers have pointed out, the \\"reward\\" is at the end of the book. In the last several chapters, Penrose bridges the knowledge chasm by communicating the ties between nature and concept. For Penrose, this stuff is elementary however, he has made a valiant attempt to dumb it down. It does amaze me the differences in thought patterns between an realtively intelligent individual and someone like Penrose. Humbling is what comes to mind. <br /> <br />Be ready for a thoughtful and tough read, but put the time in it and you'll be rewarded highly.	2005-05-13

She furthers her argument of the dangers of the perfection trap by describing the consequences and the toll it can take on life. She provides answers to the trap, answers that most likely will assuage those habitual perfectionists, as well as the novice. Satisfying oneself is a goal worthy of effort, yet difficult at times to quantify and compose as many perfectionists don't look at finite goals. Consequently, perfectionism can be a slippery slope. <br /> <br />Quindlen moves ahead of the pack by asking the reader to consider what makes YOU happy, not your friends or family, YOU. This is an underlying message in the book...set goals and objectives in life that create happiness for you. We all have a tendency, at times, do what it takes to make those around us pleased or happy. The problem is simply this: these acts are not necessarily what makes us happy and thus, we are not living our own life. <br /> <br />Quite honestly, Quindlen has created an essay designed for introspection and enrichment, one that is quite thought-provoking. This is a book that can be read and re-read, and quite quickly. Her message, though short, is quite potent. Recommended.	2005-05-12

Tom Friedman, love or hate him, tells it like it is. Yes, there are times his version of the naked truth is \\"troubling\\" and \\"myopic,\\" but that, in an author is possibly high praise. In his third book, THE WORLD IS FLAT, Friedman takes a look at the world as it is, and finds it overwhelming, which it is. He has also found it is smaller...or flat.  <br /> <br />Friedman finds and describes in acute detail the \\"evening out\\" of the world economies and powers. Outsourcing, being a topic du jour, creates some of this equalization, and the decline of certain economies concurrent with the rise of others makes up the difference. This convergence is fueled by new technology and software primarily, allowing previously \\"left behind\\" economies to compete on a world stage.  <br /> <br />Friedman identifies 10 events or \\"flatteners\\" driving this renaissance. These events, advents, and happenings are those very familiar, but perhaps overlooked as passing time. Friedman makes them seem anything but trivial, and rightly so. <br /> <br />Friedman has strong advice for his readers relative to living and thriving in this flat world. Perhaps the best advice however, was reserved for his daughters: \\"Girls, finish your homework - people in China and India are starving for your jobs.\\" <br /> <br />This is not an overnight read, nor should it be. It is thought-provoking, and should be read with care. It is not a panacea to the world's woes; rather, it is a diagnosis and guide.  <br /> <br />Recommended.	2005-05-06

Books	3	203	283	N	N	Warning: Adjective-mania present; Maintain high cynicism	Napoleon Hill. W. Clement Stone. Zig Ziglar. Robert Allen. Charles Givens. Mark Victor Hansen. All of these authors/mountebanks have the same thing in common; telling the average person on the street how to become rich. Now, all things being equal, and being totally honest, the teachings of Hill, Stone, and Ziglar fall into a category exclusive of some of these others as their passion is directed toward the human psyche and application in everyday life. These types of teaching can be and are useful as an affirmative posture to developing the level of confidence needed to deal with personal and business pressures. In fact, Napoleon Hill's book, THINK AND GROW RICH, is arguably the bible of changing one's paradigm to \\"attract\\" affluence and wealth (a no-frills book, too). That leads us to Sandy Forster's book, HOW TO BE WILDLY WEALTHY FAST: A POWERFUL STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO ATTRACT PROSPERITY AND ABUNDANCE INTO YOUR LIFE TODAY! Wow, what a mouthful. <br /> <br />OK, first the main idea of the book, growing wealth. According to Forster, one can turn a lack of prosperity into a life of wealth and abundance simply by changing one's thoughts. I can buy that developing a healthy dose of optimism and self-confidence can pave the path to a better life, and has for many people. I can also swallow that prosperity and abundance are relative terms, defined differently by different people(i.e. not necessarly financial windfalls). That said, Ms. Forster is not necessarily forthcoming about the cause-and-effect of developing a positive, self-confident outlook on life in conjunction with the potential of becoming \\"wildly wealthy.\\" In fact, this is one of those times when one wonders if this is just another cover, espousing the same platitudes we see from the likes of Suze Ormon: cut your debt, save 10% of your paycheck, cut back on your discretionary expenses, etc. These are all wonderful ideas and fiscally responsible habits to employ however, no matter how you cut it, they are platitudes with a different book cover. Think Brian Tracy; same ideas and concepts with a different title and book cover. <br /> <br />OK, all that said, a confession: I read many of these books always looking for a new gem. I rarely find it any longer (thus, the \\"platitudes\\" comment), but occasionally, one pops up. Not so here. Ms. Forster is effusive in spirit and quite likeable however, the substance of her message will be rendundant for those who have read a least 2 or 3 \\"self-help\\" or \\"get rich\\" books. The thing that torques me somewhat is her (or maybe it's the publisher) adjective use. But more than that, her repetitive inferrence to guaranteeing results. Well folks, it just doesn't happen that way. To engage in my own platitude, it takes a lot of hard work to be successful, period. Whether it is financial success or personal success, it takes hard work. Ms. Forster doesn't deny this fact however, neither does she extoll it. <br /> <br />So, I know this sounds like I'm being too literal and raining on Ms. Forster's parade. I'm not. What I am doing is attempting not to put an exclamation mark after every sentence, not throw out guarantees like they're pennies, not make success sound like it's a walk in the park, and not trivialize the successes of those who have busted their humps to become successful. Self-confidence and optimism are incredibly important attributes, but no more important that pragmatism and a healthy dose of skepticism...for without these last two \\"attributes,\\" one might be fooled into thinking something is easy (when, in fact, it's not). <br /> <br />Three stars for those who have never read a book of this nature. <br />	2005-05-06

As one who has used the word widely, and apparently, frivolously for many years, pausing to consider the usage and context was, well, different. Harry Frankfurt has very likely created one of the most unlikely titles for a book that delves into the world basic untruths (not quite as catchy as Harry's title). Regardless the spin one places when attempting to explain just what this book is about, Frankfurt has created a brief treatise on the subject, manner, and usage of untruths, and called it what it is...bullshit. Frankfurt has used this spurious title to grab the attention of the reader; beyond that, the content is quite serious, philosophical even, about the abundance of bullshit we all must wade through to find truth. If one knows the author from his previous offerings, one will easily know the serious nature of Frankfurt's new offering, \\"ON BULLSHIT.\\"  <br /> <br />Before I move on, I want to address the size of this book immediately. There are many readers/reviewers apparently turned off by the length of this book, making ostensible conclusions as to its inbility to deliver a message in 80 short pages. Well, this reviewer believes that is bullshit. I live in a world of non-fiction works; my consulting business keeps me there. Reading tome after tome of boorish filler leaves me ready to purge at times. Consequently, finding someone willing to be succinct and to the point is quite refreshing. Another book with this same \\"type\\" of short message, but which created lasting impact for many was Michael Jordan's co-authored book, \\"I CAN'T ACCEPT NOT TRYING.\\" While addressing a niche audience, this book is fabulous. As a matter of fact, I highly recommend it; but just try getting a copy. They have limited the runs to the extent that this book sells for many times its cover price on used sites. My long-winded point: a book must NOT meet a weight test to deliver a poignant message. ON BULLSHIT is just such a book. <br /> <br />So, what exactly is Frankfurt's message RE:Bullshit? The line of demarcation seems to  lie between masking the truth vs. masking one's intentions. Ponder that for a moment and the fog easily clears, and if you're still having trouble, read on. The premise of Frankfurt's treatise can be summarized in the first paragraph of the book: <br /> <br />\\"One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Everyone contributes his share.\\" <br /> <br />From this point forward, Frankfurt instructs the reader on the similarities and differences between the oft-used \\"synonyms\\" and the true word, \\"bullshit.\\" As I stated before, Frankfurt even waxes philosophical into the reader's ability to grasp the theoretical understanding of bullshit. One of my favorite passages of sagacious branding is how a lie actually works; Frankfurt has an opinion, a damn good one. <br /> <br />\\"If the lie works, then its victim is twice deceived, having one false belief about what is in the liar's [possession] and another false belief about what is in the liar's mind.\\" <br /> <br />Commons sense? Sure, but who has captured it in this context? Only Frankfurt. <br /> <br />It won't take one long to identify the bullshitters in one's life from the non-bullshitters. Applying these \\"principals\\" makes it quite easy. And, should you decide you want to test your new-found knowledge and \\"skill set,\\" check out any speech by damn near any politician. If your bullshit alarm doesn't begin screaming, keep practicing. <br /> <br />The antithesis to WAR AND PEACE in many ways, ON BULLSHIT is an excellent read. Recommended. <br />	2005-05-01

A short book born of an expanded speech to a high school graduating class, Maria Shriver has penned a gem for females and males alike. Additionally, I don't necessarily think her 10 steps are isolated for the young; many of these precepts are applicable to the average adult in every day life. And, before you begin thinking this is just another celebrity trying to make another buck, think again. Maria Shriver is an odd character; as one who has practically been in the limelight her entire life, she is neither pompous or pretentious. Her offerings are heartfelt and poignant.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most important gem in this book is \\"Fear can be your best teacher.\\" This, particularly for young adults but for mature adults as well, is such an important premise. Fear, along with its twin primary emotion, greed, create more ill feelings, health concerns, mistakes, anger, resentment, and doubt than practically any other emotion. As a business consultant, I deal with fear constantly; I have so very many clients who are afraid to do much of anything. Fear is paralyzing and dangerous. But I digress... <br /> <br />Maria Shriver, while short and succinct, has created a wonderfully well written and important \\"set of instructions\\" for life. Female or male, young or old, this book will be quite useful and perhaps, magical. Recommended.	2005-05-01

Although I abhorred economics while in school, I've become fascinated with both micro- and macro- disciplines in the last five years or so. The upside to the desire to learn about economics is simple: there are a plethora of books, articles, newsletters, and other rags extolling every imaginable corner of economics. That said, discerning the valuable sources from the chaff is the key, and frankly, the only real way to know is to pick up the book, read it, and evaluation. Well, I can tell you without equivocation that FREAKONOMICS fits the mold of excellence <br /> <br />FREAKONOMICS, authored by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, reflects economics from a contrarian perspective, or perhaps, as the title infers a \\"freak's\\" perspective. Levitt attacks economic platitudes by asking questions that are, well, freaky. Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? Does a good first name contribute to success in life? The questions only get better.  <br /> <br />Levitt is anything but conventional. He opens the book by espousing his overview of economic theory, a theory he seemingly chides, yet respects, for he sees economics as \\"a study of incentives - how people get what they want or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing.\\" Unorthodox to be sure, but spot on as well. While Levitt's genius is obvious, his social conventions are similar to those of Don Imus. For instance, Levitt floats the proposition that violent crime in the `90s is directly related to the result and instance of legalized abortion in the `70s. Huh? Well, don't laugh; he provides arguably compelling evidence in support of this theory.  <br /> <br />Despite his lack of ostensible sensitivity, Levitt rates high as an erudite economist, and, without doubt, has written a very entertaining book on a subject that can be as dry as the Mohave. And, why not? Levitt has the dubious honor of owning both Harvard and MIT degrees...pretty heady by any standard <br /> <br />Levitt and Dubner havecreated a book that will be widely heralded and hated. The purists will see it as a rogue attack on a venerable discipline while the unconventional will hail it as genius. Regardless one's position, it is wonderful in its creativity, and thought-provokingly fabulous. The reader need not have any prerequisite knowledge of economics; in fact, that might pose more barriers than less. Regardless, FREAKONOMICS is warmly recommended for economic knowledge and highly recommended for creative content. <br />	2005-04-30

However, after reading many of them, CONSPIRACY OF FOOLS is probably one of my favorites. And, while I do agree with other reviewers' comments about Eichenwald's intense focus on Fastow as the puppet master, I can't help but think this is not too far from the truth. If, on the other hand, you haven't had the opportunity to catch up on this abomination, two other books are very worthy of mention: 24 DAYS by Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller, and THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind (by the way, Bethany McLean receives high mention in CONSPIRACY as the tenacious young reporter who was not afraid to take on these power brokers). <br /> <br />Very simply put, I love Eichenwald's style. He has taken a subject, which can be extremely complex and dry (i.e. special purpose entities), and has provided the reader with a basis to understand how they were initiated, what they were \\"designed\\" to do, and where they failed miserably. And, while a novice to structured finance and accounting may not walk away from the book totally schooled on SPEs, one cannot say Eichenwald failed to explain the general basics. Further, Eichenwald has not created a historical rendering of events; rather, he has created a historical novel, of sorts. The book reads more like a novel and less like a business/non-fiction book. <br /> <br />Two of the more interesting features in this book are Eichenwald's \\"Cast of Characters,\\" and \\"The Primary Deals,\\" both of which occupy the forward section of the book. The \\"Cast of Characters\\" is no less than six pages (I didn't count the actual characters, but I'd bet there are in excess of 100). This \\"Cast\\" is Eichenwald's attempt to shortcut the incredible level of descriptive detail it would take to introduce each new character, their place in relation to Enron, their role, and interaction with other characters. Although it is daunting as aprecursor to beginning the first chapter, it is telling in the breadth of individuals and firms this fraud touched (not to mention the thousands of employees, many of whom lost all their retirement savings). Perhaps as, or more, important than the \\"Cast\\" is \\"The Primary Deals.\\" These pages list the deals structured by Fastow et al, which effectively took Enron down. If I could impress upon a reader to focus on the \\"Deals\\" before starting the book, rest assured that the reader will have a greater comprehension of the schemes and internal cabals that took down a Fortune 50 company. <br /> <br />As the title of my review suggests, fear and greed dominate this book and the Enron story. This can be immediately evidenced by the incontrovertible activities inside (and outside) the company that are absolutely unethical and illegal (read: fraudulent). And, though these acts weren't totally hidden, the twin powers of fear and greed kept anyone/everyone from stepping up until it was too late (even whistleblower and ostensible heroine Sherron Watkins is not totally clean, in my opinion). The poster children for Fear: the Houston partners of Arthur Andersen (of course, greed was just as powerful here). The Houston AA partners were so fearful of losing Enron as a client that they turned the other cheek to obvious accounting infractions and fraud...even when their own Standards Group was telling them to run! As to the poster children for Greed: the cast is ponderous, but Andy Fastow and Michael Kopper are the Kings of Greed. Through their simple, yet complex collusion, they robbed Enron, its creditors, and investors of close to $100 million. Perhaps more egregious however, is their part in devising such incompetent and fraudulent SPEs, which ultimately were nothing more than shell games. <br /> <br />In the end, Eichenwald is laser-focused on Fastow, and Kopper to a lesser degree. This has caused other reviewers a bit of heartburn in the sense that Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling are presented as intelligent, yet \\"empty-suited\\" lackeys. I'm not sure I agree with Eichenwald's overview of Lay and Skilling however, it doesn't detract from the story Eichenwald tells. And while Eichenwald's poisonous pen was aimed at Fastow, honestly, I couldn't agree more. Fastow was quite simply a con man. He wasn't qualified to be the CFO of a small, private company, much less a Fortune 50 company. He lied, manipulated, stole, and cheated...all this from an executive who has the trust of thousands of investors. There was nothing but failure in the cards. <br /> <br />CONSPIRACY is a great read and one much less stuffy than expected. The only reason I didn't lay 5 stars on this books was the perceived imbalance of blame that, in this reviewer's opinion, should have been laid at the feet of Lay and Skilling. <br />	2005-04-13
US	52631726	R2QZKLH1M3XZER	039915180X	797916108	Hidden Prey	Books	3	45	47	N	N	Fair...that really sums it up.	I've read all of Sandford's previous PREY novels as well as his KIDD novels; at this point, the KIDD novels, particularly the last two offerings, are easily the better reads, in my opinion. While the PREY novels are noted for simple yet intriguing storylines, HIDDEN PREY goes the opposite direction. Sandford decides to take an improbable storyline, a rather complex one at that, and tones down our hero, Lucas Davenport. In the end, this makes for a very apathetic read, particularly if you've enjoyed the sharp edge of Davenport in novels past.<br />HIDDEN PREY begins with the murder of a Russian merchant marine, or so it seems. Soon thereafter, a homeless woman is garroted, the site extremely gruesome. What appears to be two unrelated murders turns into an apparent murder/cover-up and Lucas Davenport is called in to begin an investigation. Lucas is partnered with a Russian \\"police officer,\\" sent over by Moscow to oversee the investigation of the murdered Russian. Lucas smells a rat immediately and, throughout the book, peppers the Russian officer for information and \\"why\\" she's truly there.<br />So as not to spoil the remaining plot...Sandford is obviously sending Davenport through middle age. He is mellowing Lucas and dulling his previously sharp edge. And, while this may follow the chronology of 15 previous PREY novels (i.e. Lucas aging), it is not why most people read fiction. Although there are bursts of brutality and violence, the vast majority of the book traces the witness/suspect interrogation lines and a painfully slow amalgamation of puzzle pieces in an effort to solve the crimes. And, not to counteract the lack of suspense, even the climax fails to thrill. <br />Sandford laid his claim to fiction with the first few PREY novels; Spillaneish in their simplicity and Parkerish in their character builds. Davenport was a tough, no-nonsense cop who would tread on the imaginary line in the sand to catch the bad guy; almost no cost too great. Well, we now have a more retiring figure to deal with in Davenport. And, while this too can produce good storylines, it is something PREY fans will have to adjust to: not an easy transition, to be sure.	2004-06-01

As I write this review, President Bush and Vice President Cheney are scheduled to appear before a \\"sealed\\" session with the 9/11 Commission. The hubbub seems to be that the proceedings are sealed (i.e. no transcript, recordings, or notes) and the fact that Bush and Cheney are appearing together. The results, as yet unknown, and, according to plan, will never be known. Regardless, this had been a long, strange trip for the U.S. since September 11, 2001, and is proving to become even stranger. <br />We've been regaled with Dick Clarke's book, AGAINST ALL ENEMIES, which, frankly, I found to be well written and articulate. Obviously, an open mind allows for belief and disbelief, but a good book nonetheless. However, in this reviewer's opinion, Clarke's rendition of the 9/11 and the events leading up to the attack aren't as persuasive and well presented as the latest gem by Bob Woodward, PLAN OF ATTACK. <br />As only Woodward could, he has seemingly outdone himself. Who but Woodward could actually sway a sitting president to agree to an interview, with full knowledge that the results would be \\"interpreted\\" and published. According to Woodward, Bush sat for more than three hours of interviews along with many others including most top cabinet members. Moreover, Bush ostensibly ordered his aides and cabinet to cooperate with Woodward, and apparently, that's exactly what he received. Consequently, the result is a sobering yet necessary story by arguably the most celebrated political reporter about, again, arguably the most secretive administration in modern times. <br />PLAN OF ATTACK, in a nutshell, is the behind-the-scenes account of the thoughts, conversations, and strategy of why President Bush and his war cabinet decided to wage the current war against Iraq. Although initially focused on Afghanistan, the Taliban, and al Qaeda, Bush ordered and met incessantly with his war planners, including Gen. Tommy Franks for the specific purpose of planning an attack on Iraq. In fact, the focus on Iraq was so intense within the Administration that approximately 100 days after the 9/11 attacks, Gen. Franks visited Bush at his Crawford, TX ranch and laid out the first plan of attack on Iraq at the request of Bush through Don Rumsfeld. This, then, sets the stage for the splashy controversy regarding Bush's mindset after 9/11: was he focused on terrorism or Iraq? (Dick Clarke speaks directly to this question in AGAINST ALL ENEMIES.)<br />2002 brought about a year of grieving and recovery for the U.S. population as a result of the 9/11 attacks; however, 2002 was a year of planning for the Bush Administration, war planning. The war planning was self-sustaining and had tremendous momentum, shouldered by several Administration officials. Cheney apparently led the charge of removing Saddam by force, perhaps a remnant of not finishing the job in 1991, Woodward muses. But, it wasn't just Cheney. The much ballyhooed statement by CIA Director George Tenet of removing Saddam from power by war as the \\"only way,\\" and, of course, his further statement that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction as being a \\"slam dunk\\" (a reference to Tenet's conclusion that the presence of WMDs was absolute). <br />As the sequence of events push toward the ultimate decision to go to war, Woodward offers the reader interesting perspectives and insight into many of the key players. For instance, in my opinion, Colin Powell, while seemingly at odds with the push toward war, emerged with his reputation intact. And, although always outwardly loyal to the Administration, it is apparent that Powell is the odd man out in this group. He is treated something like a stepchild, particularly by Cheney. Cheney engaged in an ugly political battle with Powell regarding Iraq given Powell's belief that Cheney was obsessively trying to establish a connection between Iraq and al Qaeda regardless the facts presented. This bitter battle raged so intensely that Woodward infers that Powell andCheney were effectively estranged. The other key player worth mentioning is Tommy Franks. Gen. Franks, presented as the \\"soldier's soldier,\\" is a powerful, impressive presence. <br />A fabulous book by a supremely talented writer. Again, interpretations will vary but most readers will, at the very least, be more informed about current events relative to the Iraqi war than ever before.	2004-04-28

Passions are strange and as vast as the spectrum. I can remember my mother washing and saving plastic baggies (zip-locks); I thought she was being provident, but perhaps it was her hobby, her passion. Regardless, we all have those idiosyncratic passions or, perhaps, pet peeves might better describe it.  For Lynn Truss, a new British author, it is punctuation. Not grammar, as she is quick to point out, but punctuation.<br />As an aspiring writer, I can fully understand her pickiness but perhaps not her over-the-top swag. When my employees write letters or memos to clients, they always bring them into my office and ask me to \\"bleed on them,\\" a reference to my red editing pen. So, Ms. Truss's (or should that be Truss'?) punctuation fixation hits home for me; consequently, EATS, SHOOTS& LEAVES was a book I had to have and absorb. Ms. Truss does not disappoint. Not only articulate, passionate, and intellectually polished, she has a biting wit that actually makes ESL very readable, even for those considered punctuation-challenged. <br />That said, Ms. Truss's ESL is punctuation pedantry at its best. Consider, if you will, Ms. Truss's example of the movie poster for \\"Two Weeks Notice,\\" the Hugh Grant/Sandra Bullock film. Well, Ms. Truss couldn't consider whether this movie might be smashing or a bomb as she was too busy gnashing her teeth over the abuse of the apostrophe, or lack thereof in this case. Ms. Truss was mortified that anyone would let this title be published and displayed to the public without the apostrophe in the word \\"...Week's...\\" And while one maybe irritated or effacing of misplaced apostrophes-or other punctuation gaffes-in movie titles or store signs, it is quite hard to make up an example in which such a mistake might lead to a real ambiguity of meaning. Enter Lynn Truss to our collective rescue. Ms. Truss becomes outraged at such solecisms, extolling the lunacy of the Hugh Grant film title, bemoaning newspaper headlines with missing apostrophes, and even detailing how she has specifically walks into shops whose window signs are deficient in terms of punctuation. <br />Ms. Truss does provide the reader with excellent guidance beyond the apostrophe and comma (rather boring punctuation marks) when she discusses the attenuated history of other punctuation marks and their usages-dashes, brackets and other sexy marks. Ms. Truss makes a fervent plea for the preservation of our current system of punctuation as opposed to the blatantly nonintellectual and barbaric system prevalent in a world embracing email and blogs.<br />All in all, at barely 200 pages, ESL is a fun, quick read, particularly for those who are purists when it comes to grammar and punctuation. Moreover, it is a poignant reminder that, in a world obsessed with email, instant messaging, and blogging, in most cases, one must still possess the skills to craft a well-written letter in his or her chosen profession. It is a must in my profession and one that far too many professionals take for granted.	2004-04-22

I must admit that picking up ANGELS AND DEMONS after reading THE DA VINCI CODE presented Dan Brown with the unenviable task of great expectations for this reviewer.  While DA VINCI still garners disparate reviews, it is a very well told story. In any event, with the bar set so high, A&amp;D had a veritable mountain to climb. While plausibility comes into serious play at the book's climax, the storyline and style crescendos were fabulous...this seems to be a quality Dan Brown enjoys to his benefit.<br />For those who have read these books in reverse order (like me), the reader is reintroduced to Robert Langdon, the Harvard symbologist and hero of DA VINCI. The shrill ring of his telephone awakens Langdon in the wee hours of the morning only to be slapped with what Langdon feels is a prank call. As he has his morning tea, he receives a fax with a symbol; a symbol that chills his blood and makes him realize the earlier phone call was anything but a prank.<br />A little known albeit preeminent physicist, Leonardo Vetra, is on a laser-focused mission to bridge the omnipresent chasm between science and religion. As a senior resident physicist at Switzerland's renowned Consiel European pour la Recherché Nucleaire (CERN), Vetra, also a closeted Catholic priest, has discovered how to produce antimatter, considered the most powerful element known to man (think of Star Trek). However, before he has completed his investigation and research into its appropriate use, Vetra is found murdered in his own apartment on the CERN campus. CERN's emotionless director, Max Kohler, has called on Langdon as Vetra's body has been mutilated and branded, branded with the ancient and esoteric symbol of the Illuminati.  <br />As Langdon attempts to piece together this bizarre and macabre scene, he meets Vetra's daughter, Vittoria, also a CERN scientist. Vittoria, grief-stricken yet determined to find her father's killer, informs Langdon and Kohler of the antimatter experiments only to find thata larger container of antimatter is missing. The killer has somehow gained entrance into the bowels of CERN in the super secure facility where the Vetras were performing their antimatter experiments. The killer, ostensibly a member of the Illuminati, has left a message claiming that he deposited the antimatter somewhere within Vatican City, where the cardinals have gathered to select a new pope to replace the recently deceased pope. Vittoria explains that the stolen sample will not only eradicate all of Vatican City but a great portion of Rome itself! Langdon and Vittoria make their way to Rome in an effort to divine their way to the killer, recover the antimatter, and save a great part of the Catholic priesthood.<br />While A&amp;D has a heady plot, Brown provides well-described explanations of the symbology, science, and religious overtones. Short of being a religious scholar, it is difficult for the layperson to discern fact from fiction however, Brown provides credible detail leading the reader to believe the veracity of the presented \\"facts.\\" As with DA VINCI, Brown weaves \\"fact\\" and fiction in a wonderful blend designed to thrill and shock. Brown then develops further credibility by describing and, at the beginning of the book, mapping, much of the historical detail. For instance, the protocol, practice, and history involved in the selecting a new pope is explained in painful yet readable detail. And, to ensure the dark side receives its due, Brown details the somewhat nefarious brotherhood of the Illuminati.<br />While certain visuals in the climax left me somewhat dubious, Brown has crafted yet another powerful yet controversial novel sure to whet the appetites of many. A very good read and certainly recommended.	2004-04-15
US	52631726	R1GLOWPWCQA6HK	0399151451	786542099	Bad Business (Spenser Mystery)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Spenser tackles white collar thugs...	It seems quite en vogue to take the current dirty laundry in today's white-collar world and use it as a backdrop for a novel or television show. Robert B. Parker (RBP), widely renowned for his Spenser novels, has taken a page from this trend as the setting for his latest Spenser iteration, BAD BUSINESS. And, while the company could be one of many, RBP sure sounds as though he's chiding Enron in this one.<br />BAD BUSINESS begins with the introduction of a new client, Marlene Rowley. Ms. Rowley is depicted as something of a haughty socialite, one borne of entitlement and very accustomed to having things her way. Veteran readers of Spenser know these types of attitude are fingernails on Spenser's chalkboard. As Ms. Rowley explains her plight, a wayward husband who she desperately wants to catch and &quot;hang,&quot; she continues directing Spenser as to what he will do, when he will do it, and how he will do it. Spenser slowly but directly pops Ms. Rowley's balloon of self-importance in typical fashion. After the preliminaries are out of the way, Spenser agrees to follow Mr. Rowley in an attempt to catch him in the act. <br />Spenser has a very easy time finding, following, and ascertaining that Mr. Rowley is indeed seeing another woman. However, while bird-dogging Rowley, he spies someone shadowing Mr. Rowley's paramour. After confronting this private cop, Spenser further discovers that Ms. Rowley is also being tailed by yet another private cop. Oh, how the plot thickens. This plays directly into the Spenser psyche as he begins moving his investigation into areas peripheral to the primary investigation...and what juicy nuggets he finds! And, as he does so often, Spenser enlists the help of Hawk, the dark anti-hero, who all Spenserians have come to love. While Hawk does not flex his muscles in BAD BUSINESS, he and Spenser do engage in their give-and-take dialogue that is, as always, fabulous. <br />As RBP delves into white-collar criminal elements, the reader is introduced to a new character, Marty Siegel, a self-proclaimed \\"best accountant in the world,\\" to read the tea leaves, as it were, given that Spenser and Hawk are clueless when it comes to financial reports. Although one would think the dialogue between Spenser and a \\"bean counter\\" would be somewhat prosaic, leave it to RBP to cast an accountant with an attitude. <br />RBP has recreated the drama present in so many earlier Spenser novels and has managed to weave the backdrop of current events into this offering, which, from this reviewer's perspective, gives BAD BUSINESS tangible credibility. While I love the physical barbarity of Hawk and Spenser against the \\"bad guys,\\" BAD BUSINESS manages to hold the same spell with very little \\"B\\" violence.<br />Four and one-half stars. A great read.	2004-04-15

Well, I unabashedly admit that I'm a fan of Imus and thoroughly enjoy his morning show; it is addictive as is his eccentric humor. And, although Don is controversial and scathing at times, his quest and cause at the Imus Ranch is impressive and authentic. Moreover and perhaps most importanly, Don is quick to remind us that 100% of the proceeds of his products (and this book) go to the Imus Ranch (for those unfamiliar, the Imus Ranch hosts pediatric cancer patients, those with blood-borne diseases, and young family members of those patients). The Ranch is a working cattle ranch, similar to Don's childhood roots, devoted entirely to these kids and allowing them to have this unusual and exhilarating experience. <br />The Imus Ranch is the backdrop and inspiration for Deidre's (Don's wife) new book, THE IMUS RANCH: COOKING FOR KIDS AND COWBOYS. The book is impeccably adorned with outstanding photographs, stories, and letters from those kids who have attended a session at the Ranch. The book includes over 100 recipes afforded those participants while staying at the Ranch and, although it is vegetarian fare, most recipes provide dairy and meat substitute options. As a result, this book will appeal to a wide audience. And, if you're not buying it for any other reason than to read about the Ranch, its roots, and its purpose, you'll have gone a long way to help the kids continue to fight the good fight.<br />As an aside, on his radio/TV show, Don has humorously ranted on one particular picture in the book. The picture reflects the rusticly-adorned living area of the main house including a chess board in the foreground. The first thing Don noted was that the Queen was on the wrong square! Although he made the necessary changes and requested the picture be retaken, he has capitalized on the mistake by declaring that anyone fortunate enough to have purchased one of those books with the Queen in the incorrect position will have a collectors item. <br />A great book, a great cause. Buy it and enjoy!	2004-04-13

Political exposes are typically sensationalized accounts of a former politico's experiences as told to an unwitting biographer. The latest and greatest, AGAINST ALL ENEMIES, is much more than just abuzz, it is literally on fire as its release was concurrent (timed or no?) with the 9/11 Commission hearings. And, whether you find Richard Clarke (the former terroism czar under Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II...and Reagan) credible or not, many of the revelations from ENEMIES are alarming at best. <br />ENEMIES approaches each President and amplifies the approach to terrorism led by each man but, without any doubt (as is splashed all over the airwaves), Clarke saves his harshest criticism and indictments for Bush II and his advisors. His charge? Failure  to take terroism and, in particular, Al-Qaeda seriously. He further charges that Bush II and team were laser focused on Iraq from the outset although certain reports and intelligence indicated otherwise. <br />Although terrorism relative to domestic and foreign/U.S. targets became a growing phenomenon in the Clinton/Bush II times, Clarke details how Bush I ignored the terrorism threat and cites his failure to eliminate Saddam Hussein, thus 'necessitating' Bush II to take up where Bush I failed. <br />According to Clarke, Clinton had the best grasp of the terroism issue and Al-Qaeda's growing presence and control. However, Clinton's plans to address this threat were undermined by the Lewinski sex scandal and subsequent impeachment proceedings.  <br />Clarke's rendition is very believable regardless the dubious timing of this book's release. This will be a hotly debated issue for some time to come and, as I write this review, Condi Rice's &quot;sworn&quot; testimony is less than one week away in front of the Commission. While she will no doubt douse some of Clarke's sizzle, ENEMIES is a very readable account of a career man who feels very strongly about the lack of action taken by the last 20+ years of sitting Presidents.	2004-04-02
US	52631726	R29UWHFDCEWSWI	0316602906	981192109	The Big Bad Wolf	Books	3	34	44	N	N	Damn! Patterson just misses...	Will the real James Patterson please stand up? Most Patterson loyalists have been waiting for this moment. When will the real Patterson emerge again? We've had glimpses of the greatness and BIG BAD WOLF (&quot;BBW&quot;) is no exception however, Patterson seems to just fall short time and again. It always seems worth the read just to determine if the magic has returned. Regardless and like most Patterson fans, I'll continue to buy and read his books until I tire of waiting for the real Patterson to stand up.<br />Early in BBW, the Wolf, a renegade Russian mafiya soldier, is introduced to the reader. In something of urban myth fashion, the Wolf has gained underground notoriety as a ruthlessly cold killer without face or name. One particularly telling tale revolves around the Wolf's encounter with a jailed U.S. mob boss. As the story goes, the Wolf is able to walk into a 'super-maximum' security prison in Colorado to speak with jailed mob boss, don Augustino &quot;Little Gus Palumbo.&quot; Ostensibly, the Wolf has a proposition for Little Gus. The Wolf completes his business and walks out off prison grounds undeterred. The next day, Little Gus's body is found in his cell with virtually every bone in his body broken. Those familiar with Russian mafiya tactics know this as \\"Zamochit.\\" The urban tale became reality and the universal underground came to know that the Wolf's reputation was well deserved.<br />At the end of the previous Cross iteration, Alex had just joined the FBI. As BBW opens, Alex is in the early stages of training at FBI headquarters. Given his impressive law enforcement background and experience, Alex is finding much of the \\"newbie\\" work and training quite rote however, ever the good trooper, Alex presses on and doesn't complain openly. Alex's theoretical training soon becomes on the job training. Alex is called in when the wife of a prominent judge is kidnapped in the parking lot of an Atlanta shopping mall. Unbeknownst to Alex, an underground, internet-based cabal of twisted individuals \\"places orders\\" for human slaves. This woman seems to have become the next victim of this perverse group.<br />Alex is whisked from newbie orientation and flown to Atlanta. The Director of the FBI wants Alex on this case. Alex soon learns of the case and the fact that this isn't the first unsolved disappearance; to the contrary, the FBI has recent unsolved disappearances in several other states. The puzzling and troubling aspect of each of these disappearances is the total lack of contact, no ransom demand and no reappearance of the missing person. After a tip, the FBI is able to track down the two-person team responsible for the Atlanta kidnapping. The two turn out to be low-level associates in the Russian mafiya, Slava and Zoya. But, neither can shed any light on the whereabouts of the judge's wife as they are both found dead...Zoya, by means of Zamochit.<br />The plot thickens when Alex and his FBI team run on to 14-year-old computer hacker Lili Olsen. It seems Lili, a modern-day Kevin Mitnick, has hacked her way into a secure chat room called &quot;The Wolf's Den.&quot; Lili clandestinely observes the dialogue between such aliases as Sterling, Mr. Potter, Sphinx, Marvel, and, of course, The Wolf. The dialogue centers on buying individuals with certain characteristics and attributes. However, the talk quickly descends to the depths of sickness when the discussion turns to disposal of these \\"slaves\\" and their willingness to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for their next minion. <br />BBW has all the makings of a great Patterson offering. The storyline is brilliant however, where BBW falls short is character development and ultimately, climax. The reader has peripheral glimpses of the characters in this book, other than Alex, his kids, and Nana Mama. If Patterson had taken the time to truly allow the reader to see inside the characters, to know them, this novel would have been fabulous. Instead, it became a middle-of-the-road novel written by an author who used to write great novels. And, one of my great pet peeves of Patterson in his Cross novels, Alex always seems to find some personal tragedy in the midst of an intense investigation. It gets old. You want to scream, \\"When does Alex ever win<br />Overall, this is a very readable and worth reading book. It is still not the Patterson of old but it is a reasonable offering.	2004-01-31

I had a bit of an advantage before reading Dr. Altshuler's book. You see, I've know Larry and have been a patient of his, from time-to-time, for several years. To say I was extremely excited for this published offering would be a supreme understatement. <br />I met Dr. Altshuler some years ago in a business setting. At the time, I had a chronic back problem resulting from an old sports injury. While it wasn't a debilitating problem, it was constant and frustrating. One of those chronic pains that was judged each morning as I arose from bed...sometimes not as painful, other times very painful. In any event, I was in a business meeting with Dr. Altshuler and was having a fairly problematic day with my back so, as I sat down at the conference table, I did so very gingerly. Dr. Altshuler asked me what the trouble was and I very offhandedly told him about my back problem. I indicated I had been to countless chiropractors and massage therapists to no avail. He asked me if I was willing to let him have a shot at helping me and I said, &quot;sure.&quot; Well, to say I was hesitant to go to a doc who openly touted his alternative methodologies-cold laser therapy, not to mention acupuncture-was, well, rather uncomfortable. Net, net, I was very dubious...alternative treatment sounded like voodoo. However, my back problem was not getting any better and, as I told him, even if he had to sacrifice a chicken, I was willing to give it a go. <br />I arrived at his clinic for my first treatment. He did a thorough history and examination and prescribed a regimen of cold laser therapy and infrasonic treatments. He further put me with one of his technicians who offered several exercises and stretching activities to complement and assist in the treatment. The one thing he told me that I never forgot as well as solidifying my belief that this man REALLY knew what he was doing was, &quot;These treatments should help get rid of the pain. It doesn't work for everyone but it helps most people.&quot; That let me know immediately that I was dealing with a realist, someone who was interested in his patients' well-being and health. <br />After the first week of treatments, my back was not any better and my attitude toward alternative medicine was still dubious at best. However, I was determined to run the spectrum of treatments in an effort to give this &quot;new medicine&quot; a real try. As the next few weeks and treatments passed, I noted some relief. Not full relief, mind you, but relief nonetheless. The best was yet to come. <br />Upon full completion of my treatments, some eight weeks later, my back pain literally dissipated. It was gone. That was in 1997. To this day, I still do the exercises and stretching activities each morning but can attest that I have still have no back pain. Voodoo? I don't think so. His knowledge, care, and thoroughness in determining the best treatment regimen was the key. His only interest was alleviating and ridding me of pain. <br />I've returned to Dr. Altshuler from time-to-time for various treatments associated with other aches, pains, and allergies...yes, allergies. While not all the results have been as miraculous as my experience with my back, the treatments have always provided relief. <br />Dr. Altshuler's new book, BALANCED HEALING, is a fairly exhaustive offering of his knowledge of conventional and alternative medicine (thus, &quot;balanced&quot; healing). This book is groundbreaking in its breadth and guidance. It is easy to read yet, in this reviewer's opinion, should be held closely as a reference guide. He offers an index of ailments with corresponding treatments. The only downside of the book is that the reader doesn't get the pleasure of Dr. Altshuler's hands-on presence. However, it's pretty close. <br />Awareness of alternative methods is becoming more accepted throughout the United States. Other countries have been using alternative treatments for years, or even centuries (acupuncture has been around 'forever' in China). The U.S. is in its infancy relative to acceptance of alternative methodologies. Without doubt, Dr. Altshuler is a domestic pioneer in combining conventional and alternative methods of treatment for a variety of illnesses and chronic syptoms. <br />This book will be a boon to anyone inasmuch as we all need &quot;a bit of cure&quot; now and then. The price of the book is negligible for the knowledge and priceless insight and the cure is, well, quite balanced.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-01-25
US	52631726	R2IH559GR022OX	0312316690	556245860	The Tristan Betrayal	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Not his best but still Ludlum nonetheless	With Robert Ludlum's passing in 2001, it was easy to surmise that any subsequent offerings would be \\"something less\\" than if the master were still alive. Still and all, we've seen the co-authored books, wherein Ludlum would provide the outline and the co-author would pen the tale. These books, while not in Ludlum's league, are still worthy offerings in the genre. Subsequently, Ludlum's agent and publisher commissioned completion of partial manuscripts and published them in Ludlum's name. While still solid mystery and intrigue, most have fallen short of true Ludlum quality. I guess the only thing to say is this is what we're left with...a remaining taste and a lot of great memories.<br />THE TRISTAN BETRAYAL opens in Moscow 1991, with political uprsing caused by Communist hard-liners intent on overthrowing Gorbachev's government. The reader is introduced to the venerable American Ambassador Stephen Metcalfe, who is secretly and urgently summoned to bring his considerable experience and knowledge to bear on this coup attempt. Only later does the reader learn why Metcalfe is called to broker this deal, one he is immensely qualified to handle. <br />Flashback 1040...Hitler's Nazi Germany has ravaged a great deal of Europe and is revelling in its short-lived glory. Russia has yet to enter the fray and is solidly glued to fence-riding. Similarly, America has not entered what would eventually become World War II however, Roosevelt is sparing no cost to ensure the cost of entering this conflict is well-studied and planned. To this end, America and Britain are running the gammut with their spys attempting to clandestinely ascertain the Nazis \\"Achilles Heel.\\" American spy, Stephen Metcalfe, undercover as a debonair Argentian playboy, is assigned the seemingly impossible task of making contact with a former lover, the only woman he has truly loved in his short life. This woman, Lana, is a Russian primaballerina whose father is a fomer Russian general. Metcalfe learns that Lanahas a new lover...a dispicable German (Nazi) diplomat. Metcalfe's mission? Regain Lana's trust with the goal of feeding false military information about the Russian military to the Nazis through Lana's lover. The goal? To give America the ally it needs by misdirecting Hitler to attack Russia. <br />Metcalfe's cover is unwittingly blown in Paris and he is pursued by the Nazi Gestapo from Paris to Moscow, and ultimately to Berlin. Along the way, many of Metcalfe's brethern agents and friends are murdered by various assassins but in particular, one German agent whose weapon of choice is a piano string. As Metcalfe winds his way toward his mission's goal, he runs afoul of the ever-paranoid Soviets, who now want to see him dead as well. Metcalfe has to stay ahead of both Gestapo and Soviet intelligence as well as his own side, a side willing to sacrifice one to benefit the many. <br />The resulting intrigue is pure Ludlum. The storyline however suffers without the master's transparent segues. This story moves back and forth from WWII to present day somewhat disjointedly and without much punch. I found myself willing these transitions to mirror other Ludlum offering albeit futilely. While the storyline provides the requisite twists and allure, the climax falls woefully short.<br />For Ludlum afficianados, TRISTAN is one you'll want to read. However, be prepared for something less than the master's touch.	2004-01-17

John Sandford is best known for his \\"Prey\\" series featuring Lucas Davenport, a tough, street-smart cop. Sandford's alter-ego to Davenport is Kidd, a \\"gray area\\" hacker often on the dubious side of the law. While \\"Prey\\" and Davenport hog the headlines for Sandford, its the Kidd novels I find most intriguing and fun. <br />As an intro, Kidd is an artist...hacker; his love is art but his trade is hacking. As the Kidd novels grow, we find Kidd becoming a more demanded artist but again, his penchant for the dark side is where the fun is. This is the fourth in Sandford's Kidd series, featuring our anti-hero Kidd, and LuEllen the thief, Kidd's companion/sometimes lover. <br />THE HANGED MAN'S SONG abruptly begins with the murder of none other than the mysterious Bobby, the hacker's hack, the mysterious man with his finger on the pulse of all that is computer geekdom. Bobby has set up an elaborate network of hackers, all of whom \\"know of\\" Bobby but don't know Bobby. Kidd is a part of this network and knows exactly the power of Bobby. Bobby was the faceless friend of Kidd and LuEllen who had assisted them in previous \\"jobs\\" of a somewhat nefarious nature. Upon learning of Bobby's \\"silence,\\" and what turns out to be his murder, Kidd and others in the network become extremely concerned about Bobby's missing laptop, apparently stolen by Bobby's killer. This laptop held many, many dark secrets, facts, and evidence...information that could destroy lives-including Kidd's.<br />Kidd, LuEllen and another network friend, John, begin a frantic investigation into Bobby's murder and missing laptop. Their obvious goal is to retrieve the laptop and secure the information contained therein but, just as importantly, nab and \\"bring to justice\\" Bobby's killer. <br />As with all Kidd novels, HANGED MAN unflinchingly proves that Sandford is rather salty when it comes to computers and hacking. The somewhat dark side of Kidd's character is further developed with this offering and shows some emotion not seen before; that of retribution. Kidd and LuEllen pull out all the stops in their search for this retribution. Along the way, Kidd and LuEllen's off & on romance is rekindled, one of borne of need, desire, and, of course, lust.   <br />HANGED MAN is a great read but also provides a glimpse of the power of information, something we've all been exposed to. Further, it poses the great question of the real potential of \\"Big Brother.\\" Highly recommended.	2004-01-17

After reading many of the reviews here, that maxim still appears to hold true. With TIMELINE, Crichton has created a novel transcending genres...science fiction, factual science (i.e. non-fiction), and historical fiction. Regardless the reader's liking of the storyline, this genre-crossing is a monumental task in and of itself, particularly when a great deal of the \\"facts\\" are indeed, facts. If nothing else, we know Michael Crichton for his great creativity and abundant resources. However, you gotta love him for his intellect.<br />Edward Johnston, a professor of history, is the leader of an archeological dig for a castle near the Monastery of Sainte-Mere, in France. The dig is being financed by a wealthy international corporation interested in excavating and reconstructing the site to convert to a tourist attraction. Johnston and his crew of three graduate students are provided with information from this corporation which is seemingly dubious, as most of this information could not be known without actually having excavated the site. Johnston is floored and infinitely curious when he discovers that his client does indeed have information about the dig site that has yet to be discovered, and it appears to be factual. True to his inquisitive nature, Johnston heads to New Mexico to investigate and speak with Robert Doniger, head of the corporation, ITC. Soon after Johnston leaves for New Mexico, the graduate students uncover a hidden room and an impossible, incredible message...an SOS that Johnston wrote to them - in 1357!<br />Upon arriving in New Mexico, Johnston meets with Doniger and learns that ITC is into quantum mechanics and has developed a \\"quantum-fax machine\\" capable of \\"faxing\\" a person to a parallel universe (i.e. time travel). What makes this fax-cum-time travel work is the grand scale of it all-Crichton sets up big stakes. The scientific mechanics would have the person traveling vaporized by lasers, then \\"faxed\\" through tiny wormholes into another potential universe, of which there are an infinite number. Crichton shows us a big underground complex, fabulous cyclotron-scale machinery and a compelling demonstration of the technology. This is big science involving huge risks; it is grand in scope and the details \\"feel\\" right. We want to suspend disbelief for time travel because time travel has reached a mythological status in our society. Who wouldn't want to travel back in time? Thus, the story begins.<br />The grad students are suddenly intrigued and mortified as Johnstons medievel SOS indicates and imminent need to be rescued. Not only do they have to make their way through 14th Century France to find the professor and bring him home - but they also have an incredibly short deadline...or become trapped in the 14th century forever. <br />The story that follows is told in incredible historical detail, medievel at it best. We have sword fights, damsels in distress, twisted,cruel villains, and other stereotypical characters. While science does play a major role in this story, it is peripheral in nature as this storyline is true fantasy albeit true-to-life. Without any doubt, this is a fast-paced thriller. <br />A truly thrilling read and, I'm certain, soon-to-be-released movie.	2004-01-04

For those who have read Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE, Greg Iles latest, THE FOOTPRINTS OF GOD, may seem like a familiar theme. Not that FOOTPRINTS delves into the thick of basic religous tenets or a particular faith; rather, Iles, as has become something of his path, explore the supernatural as related to religous belief. Of course, Brown's DA VINCI became (and still is!) an unexpected bestseller by combining the excitement of an intellectual suspense novel with rather unorthodox pronouncement toward Christianity and, perhaps more importantly, Catholicism. Again, Iles doesn't trip this line but he does throw fodder into the literary pool with FOOTPRINTS.<br />David Tennant, an M.D. and scholar of medical ethics, has been appointed by the president of the United States to the top-secret Trinity project. Trinity is the progeny of computer genius Peter Godin, a fiction contemporary of Seymor Cray. Trinity is funded by the National Security Agency and is as clandestine as any project can be classified. Trinity's goal? To reproduce a map human brain and literally &quot;install&quot; the map to a supercomputer, where it can operate at an exponential factor. Effectively, true artificial intelligence with a human factor. Coupled with the infinite mass of knowledge given the advent of the Internet, it could learn &quot;anything.&quot; Anything, the reader soon learns, mean ANYTHING. <br />As the story opens, there is a firestorm brewing at Trinity's research facility in N. Carolina. All members of the Trinity team have undergone a brainmapping exercise from a Super-MRI, one capable of creating such a brain map to attach to Trinity's supercomputer. However, all members of the team are experiencing strange side effects. While we eventually learn of the conundrum of these various effects, Tennant is having powerful, disturbing dreams. So much so that he has sought out psychiatrist, Rachael Weiss. Dr. Weiss is convinced these dreams are hallucinations born of his loss of wife and child. Concurrently, one of Tennant's colleagues who has been questioning the true reason and use of the Trinity project, is found dead, ostensibly from a stroke. Tennant doesn't buy the stroke theory. As Tennant begins to investigate what happened, he finds himself in the clutches of the NSA's security forces. After an assassination attempt, he and Dr. Weiss begin running, on the lam from the most powerful clandestine cabal in the U.S. spy arsenal. <br />Tennant's dreams have focused on the life of Jesus, with whom he has come to identify. As the story unfolds with Tennant and Weiss one step ahead of the NSA, they risk a trip to Jerusalem. Why? Because one of Tennant's &quot;dreams&quot; told him he would find the answers to his dreams in the Holy Land. When he visits Golgotha, the scene of the Crucifixion, he has an immense seizure and falls into a what appears to be a deadly coma. However, true to his belief, he awakens with new insights into the mind of God. Although Tennant and Weiss have begun falling in love, Weiss fully believes his dreams are still delusions his brain has manufactured to deal with his personal tragedy. <br />As the massive, run-on chase winds down, Tennant and Weiss find themselves in White Sands, New Mexico for a final showdown with a fully operational Trinity. What ensues in the rather long climax is stuff of fantasy and fear...a true recipe for a great novel.<br />If you're an Iles reader and have enjoyed his past books, FOOTPRINTS will be no different. For those who read too much into a novel (i.e. &quot;that can't really happen&quot;), you'll be sorely disappointed and left saying the same thing many of Dan Brown's pundits have been saying of DA VINCI...it is too fairy tale. As for me, I read fiction to be entertained. FOOTPRINTS didn't disappoint.	2003-12-23

Flow seems to be at issue in most of these works however, Paul Krugman's new book, THE GREAT UNRAVELING, is a compilation of his NY Times columns on the economic state of the U.S. that definitely has flow. <br />A little background...Krugman was an Ivy League economics professor thought to a brilliant new mind whose efforts in the academia literary field were anxiously awaited. However, Krugman turned out to be a bit too good as a writer and become the author of several erudite books and treatises. After his name became better known in economic and business circles, he was approached by the NY Times to write a daily column RE: economics and business. The ostensible thought was the Times was looking for a well-rounded paper, one covering the mundane (read: economics) as well as the contemptible (read: politics). However, as has been the case for decades, economics and politics make strange but constant bedfellows and the rest, as they say, is history. <br />Professor Krugman's writing style is anything but boring; rather, his style flows like a sledgehammer, beating the drum of whatever subject matter stokes his inner fire. During the last presidential election, his star moved out of the economics arena and solidly into the political arena as he acquired a large contingent of daily readers savoring every last word in his less-than-admiring treatment of candidate Bush. This, as anyone who has read Krugman, is an profound understatement. <br />As a compilation of columns, THE GREAT UNRAVELING points the finger directly at GW Bush, for most every ail the U.S. has endured. (Reviewer note: while I don't agree with all of Mr. Krugman's blame-laying, he does paint a fairly logical and rational case. However, he should take walk down the street and see our man at the Fed for the remainder of his vociferous lambasting.) The upside of this outcry is that it isn't Michael Moore. At the very least, Prof. Krugman's passion is solidlyentrenched in intelligence. This simple fact has caused great consternation at the White House (having Michael Moore after you is laughable; having Paul Krugman after you is daunting). The typical foe of the current administration is woefully uninformed about economics; not so with Krugman. Consequently, the threads became more based in truth than opinion (as it related to the economic effect of various policies). <br />THE GREAT UNRAVELING includes a generous variety of his columns reflecting his view of the Bush era developed between 2000 and the present. In the beginning, he appears nothing more than &quot;miffed&quot; by the Bush administrations &quot;voodoo&quot; math to validate and justify his tax-cut, and SS/MC proposals. Although not nearly close to enough, he meekly makes a stab at Greenspan for adjusting his economic analysis to &quot;fit the political needs of the new president.&quot; To this end, he offers several very public examples of this &quot;good 'ol boy&quot; system. As time evolves, Krugman admits that he begins to see the bigger picture of ostensible corrpution and manipulation. One of his soapbox diatribes? &quot;...the efforts of an economic elite to expand its privileges.&quot; To this end, Krugman hones his trade and does it quite well. <br />The supreme question one may ponder when reading this book is how was Krugman able to read between the lines? Plain and simple: his intellect and education as an economist enabled him to see what most journalists couldn't. He was able to understand the oft times inane and super-complex economic theories, which are the cogs in the machine called the U.S. economy. He was able to perform his own math and consult with colleagues (economists, not journalists). This, in and of itself, made Krugman's take &quot;more&quot; valid and thoughtful.  <br />And, to Krugman's credit, some of his earlier warning have proven to be quite true. For instance, the tax cuts have not been paid for by an expanding economy.To the contrary, they, along with the money-printing Fed, have plunged the U.S. into deficits that could spiral the U.S. economy into oblivion. <br />Journalism is reluctant, however, to make much of an effort to find out who will benefit if a given candidate wins, and who will lose out. Instead of providing this valuable information, the media tend to explain politics in terms of high-sounding ideological piffle about a &quot;conservatism&quot; and a &quot;liberalism&quot; which have very little pertinence to anything of consequence to the voter. The result is to deaden public interest in politics by diverting the mind from the fact that there is real money at stake.<br />While THE GREAT UNRAVELING will be seen by many as nothing more than another left-wing slap at the current administration, we have to remember the basic tenets the author operates under. This is not a Michael Moore or Ann Coulter expose; this is written my a ballyhooed economist, one with an erudite knowledge of the U.S. economy and the effects of various policies on its lifeline. Politics are intangible like personalities. Economics is concrete like intellect. Read this book with an open mind and I can almost guarantee you'll come out with a new appreciate AND understanding of the hurdles and gauntlets we, the American people, face today...and will face for many years in the future.	2003-11-22
US	52631726	R130Q3Y5QWE0JA	0446530891	382868174	Split Second (King & Maxwell)	Books	4	10	13	N	N	Scorching plot...Average climax	Like many of the reviewers here, I too have an affinity for &quot;all books Baldacci.&quot; And, while I admit Mr. Baldacci has penned a few a novels which stand alone, I cannot bring myself to say his new offering, SPLIT SECOND, is not a thrilling, fun read. Baldacci has an impressive skill of weaving subplots in and out of his storyline controlling the reader's focus until he decides to change directions...typically in mid-thought. This skill is what makes Baldacci an up-and-coming star in the literary field. And while SPLIT SECOND won't rival TOTAL CONTROL or ABSOLUTE POWER, it is a book well worth it's price.<br />As in several of his other books, Baldacci spins the storyline of SPLIT SECOND around the Secret Service. Baldacci links two crimes separated by eight years and brings together two publicly disgraced Secret Service agents to solve their respective mysteries. Eight years earlier, Agent Sean King was guarding a presidential candidate and took his eyes off the candidate for a split second, a split second that changed King's life forever and ended the life of the candidate.<br />Current day...Agent Michelle Maxwell allows a presidential candidate to override the Service's chief mandate of never losing track of a subject. The result, while not as final as King's, is just as disastrous...Maxwell's subject is kidnapped. Unbeknownst to King and Maxwell, these two agents lives will become linked by two separate and ostensibly unrelated crimes all due to a &quot;split second&quot; hesitation. One candidate is dead, the other missing, and two careers are seemingly trashed.<br />Though she's been put on leave and publicly vilified, Maxwell is determined to find her missing candidate. The similarity between what happened to her and King's situation eight years earlier leads her to believe there could be a link, or at least clues to assist her in solving the crime. In the meantime, King has used the proceeds of a libel lawsuit to go to law school, become a successful small-town attorney, and live a quiet, solemn life. That quiet life ends when King is reluctantly drawn into the intrigue of Maxwell's case and, his own. Joining the cast of characters and adding wrinkle to wrinkle is Joan Dillinger, King's former lover and Secret Service partner. Dillinger now runs an international investigative agency and has been privately hired to find Maxwell's missing candidate.<br />As the plot twists through one dead end after another, the subplot involving the two women vying for King's affection thickens. This, as always, throws additional emotional baggage on King as he tries to close the unclosable case. With unexpected twists known to Baldacci readers, the storyline throws curve after curve spinning this thriller toward its climax. <br />With SPLIT SECOND, Baldacci proves himself adroit in combining his storyline with poignant, tight subplots, developing deep, interesting characters, and providing &quot;edge-of-your-seat&quot; action leaving the reader thirsting for more. And, while the climax may not have been up to the quality of the storyline, this is an excellent read and is highly recommended by this reviewer.	2003-11-18
US	52631726	R2AMME14YJCYP3	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Controversial and dubious but absolutely smashing!	Controversy? In spades! Dan Brown has created exactly what he, his editors, his publishers, and his agent crafted...controversy. Why? Because controversy sells. And no two subjects are the focus of controversy more than sex and religion. I applaude Mr. Brown for having the guts and keen insight into the simplistic psyche of the literary public. As to his book, THE DA VINCI CODE, I found it fun, fast-paced, and intriguing. But wait! Isn't that what one looks for in fiction?<br />The continuing controversy and scorn Mr. Brown receives is in my opinion somewhat laughable. Mr. Brown has struck the nerve of many with this book but at what cost? This book can be loosely classified as \\"historical fiction,\\" but the reader must decide where history stops and fiction starts. This intellectual conundrum is the core creator of the underlying controversy. Mr. Brown will suck you in with a known historical fact while weaving his fictional storyline around those very facts. So, by the time the reader is through a passage or chapter, he/she says, \\"Hmmmm.\\" To say this isn't ingenious is disingenuous.<br />To the book...<br />Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is in Paris attending a conference when he is awakened by a phone call from hotel management and taken to a murder scene. After dusting the sleep from his eyes, he finds the victim is the curator of The Louvre, Jacques Sauniere, a man Langdon was to have met earlier that evening. However, Sauniere never showed and now the mystery of his rude imposition is clear. The Parisian authorities ostensibly ask Langdon to assist them in their investigation due to the mysterious and arcane message left on Sauniere's body. Unbeknownst to Langdon however, the French Police consider him the prime murder suspect due to an undisclosed line in the archaic message.<br />Enter Sophie Neveu, an attractive, brainy cryptologist working for the French Police, and, conveniently, the granddaughter of Sauniere. She has seen pictures from the murder scene, including the \\"undisclosed line\\" kept from Langdon, and as such, believes Langdon to be innocent. Moreover, she believes the message grotesquely situated on her grandfather's body was left for her as a bizarre yet pointed \\"treasure hunt.\\" The treasure? The Holy Grail.<br />Langdon is a returning character from Brown's earlier novel, ANGELS AND DEMONS. THE DA VINCI CODE is an ostensible history lesson albeit dubious at best. The action however, is pure fiction and masterfully wound. His use of parallel storylines with chapter-ending cliffhangers keeps the book fast-paced and suspensful to the end. Just like a good novel should.<br />To say Da Vinci was a man ahead of his time is a supreme understatement. Perhaps a great deal of this furor is entrenched solidly in our ignorance of Da Vinci and his \\"sight\\" into the future. Remember, history has him pegged as the first to envision manned flight. This, in the 16th century, well before the Wrights put it together. So, to say Dan Brown found the right recipe for a blockbuster novel would also qualify as a supreme understatement. Brown's focus on Da Vinci's paintings and ostensibly interpretive messages within is ingenious. Let's face it, Da Vinci lived 1,500 years after the events in question. One MUST question HOW Da Vinci would KNOW the actual facts of these events. This is the overriding \\"pinch of realism\\" that will continue to make the reader wonder yet this same \\"pinch\\" continues to make the reader thirst for more.<br />I read a review wherein the author indicated the following: \\"There is a paragraph or two in 'The Da Vinci Code' conveying the true meaning of history and man's involvement with it. Those who dominate & win can write history as they see fit. Those who lose will cease to exist in history.\\" How poignant. If this theory were applied to Da Vinci's paintings and the purported sybolism/meaning, one might be able to brush aside the zealous rhetoric and enjoy this book. Again, how does Da Vinci KNOW these facts? Everyone has their own beliefs and will reach their own conclusions. Mr. Brown can be criticized for his research and promulgations relative to Christian history and the Catholic Church but the question that one must ask (if taking Brown's storyline to heart) is: Do you believe the history you know as an undeniable truth or do you question it? Is history as black and white as we learned it in school or is there room for interpretation, shades of gray if you will? You be the judge.se facts?

US	52631726	R1AETSWEQBE3N6	0385511612	430694437	Bleachers	Books	4	2	5	N	N	The personal symmetry was scary.	After reading the dustjacket, I had to pick up Grisham's latest, BLEACHERS. The DJ soundbite drew my attention immediately as I had experienced many of the same events as the main character, albeit with a happier endings. <br />BLEACHERS is set in Messina, a small town in an undisclosed state in the U.S. The state doesn't matter as Grisham wants you to know that the small town is crux of the deeper meaning. If I had to guess, I see Messina in the South Central U.S., say Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, particularly given the zealous nature of the town's love affair with a high school sport. Regardless, however one paints a small town in their mind should do just fine for the requisite imagery needed to place this story. Football is the sport of choice and anyone who is anyone played for the Messina Spartans and legendary coach Eddie Rake. <br />BLEACHERS is the story of Coach Rake and his former players, as told from the perspective of one Messina's own heros, Neely Crenshaw. Crenshaw was the Spartans' former high school All-American quarterback during a time when the Spartans were enmeshed as a perennial state championship football team. The reader learns very quickly how an All-American high school career can turn into broken dreams with injury. Neely Crenshaw, the guy with the golden arm, has his promising college (and perhaps pro) career cut short when his knee was toasted by a cheap shot on the sideline. Ah, the symmetry.<br />Neely and many other former players return to Messina and their former glory as Coach Rake, the architect of a local sports dynasty and perhaps the most powerful man in Messina, is dying. While Neely left Messina and never looked back, most of his teammates never left town and are now bankers, lawyers, policemen and, in one particurlary hilarious case, a chop-shop owner who is always one step ahead of the local constable. The site of their reunion is none other than the high school football field, the field of dreams and legends. These formerplayers, from varying classes, meet at the stadium and fill the &quot;bleachers&quot; to reminisce.<br />While many, if not most, of the former players revere Coach Rake, Neely Crenshaw has an altogether different feeling about the man. He hates him. It seems this fervent enmity was manifested from an incident during halftime of the 1987 state championship game, a game that saw Messina down by 31 points at halftime. And, a game that saw the coaches refusal to return to the sidelines for the second half. The team members swore themselves to secrecy and Neely promised never to return to Messina. It took him 15 years and Coach Rake's fate for him to break that promise.<br />BLEACHERS, considered &quot;just another short story&quot; by many reviewers, will most likely hit home with other readers. It certainly did with me. As mentioned earlier, the symmetry for me was uncanny and, while I can say I made some better decisions than Neely (thanks to many guiding hands), I personally experienced many of Neely's joys and mishaps. <br />BLEACHERS won't be a revelation or epiphany for most but it can bring back memories of &quot;the day.&quot; Grisham proves himself a deeper writer than the dyed-in-the-wool taskmaster of the legal thriller genre. And, while he is the master of this genre, I can fully understand why he would want to try something new, break new ground if you will. I applaud his continuous efforts to seek renewal, for renewal brings fresh perspective to the mainstream and for those of us who love to read Grisham, new perspective is welcome news for the future. <br />A very good, 1 - 2 hour read. Those reviewers distressed over his foray into an area not &quot;all things legal thriller,&quot; should give the man some latitude. Think about it from a personal perspective and understand the need for cathartic renewal.	2003-11-06
US	52631726	R310QJCYMXMDC4	0399150870	884197365	Stone Cold (A Jesse Stone Novel)	Books	4	39	43	N	N	The magic is showing again.	I've been a fan of Robert B. Parker for what seems like ages and have been sorely disappointed and verbally assailing in my reviews of some of his more recent offerings. The jazz, the juice, the stuff that makes RBP, well, RBP, seemed to be gone. Where was the drama, the thick plots, the wit? My feeling was RBP was waning into literary obscurity. So, now, STONE COLD comes along. Not a Spenser novel but a Jesse Stone novel. Well, whatever RBP did to inspire himself relative to creating this storyline, he needs to stay with it. STONE COLD returns RBP to his roots, that of vehement distaste for the &quot;bad guys,&quot; love for the hero, and some good old fashioned retribution.<br />For those unfamiliar with Jesse Stone, he is Spenser's career contemporary albeit his personal antithesis. Jesse is the police chief of Paradise (a community on Boston's North Shore), a functional alcholic, and milktoast in the hands of his ex-wife who is blatantly audacious and Jesse's personal nemesis. Suffice it to say that Jesse is quite human, at times, a little too much so.  <br />A man's body has appeared on the beach, two bullet holes in his heart. There is no evidence to speak of and the investigation runs short before it begins. Shortly thereafter, another victim turns up, this time in the parking lot of the Paradise Mall. She was shot twice in the chest as she unloaded her groceries. Jesse has a bad feeling confirmed when he receives the news that the bullets in both murders came from the same gun. A serial killer.<br />In the meantime, in a parallel story, a local high school girl has been raped and has come to Jesse for help. What Jesse does here is pure Parker. This is what Parker's fans love. <br />Jesse's incredibly dysfunctional relationship with Jenn, his ex-wife, continues. Still carrying the torch for everything Jenn, Jesse finds solace in many other women &quot;friends.&quot; His syrupy need to get Jenn back is old and you really want to slap him around and say, Wake UP!&quot; But, this character flaw makes him human and, at times, the underdog (read: loveable).<br />Net, net...Parker is back in this one. He introduces the bad guys early and allows the reader to follow their plans as they play cat-and-mouse against Jesse. Consequently, the suspense in this book is evident at two levels, the murder case and whether or not Jesse is going to &quot;make it&quot; to the next day. The thing we love about Jesse is his compassion for the job and desire to see justice. <br />Recommended.	2003-11-06

The mere utterance of these words can strike fear in even the most seasoned testifying expert. Never testified before or just starting out in litigation consulting? The prospect of cross-examination can provide more consternation, self-doubt and sleeplessness than a teenage first date. And, with good reason. The purpose of cross-examination is for opposing counsel to find any little chink in your testimonial armor and exploit it to discredit you, your credibility, your honor, and ultimately, your professional viability.  Still don't have your attention? Try this on for size.<br />\\"No expert is immune to cross-examination. Whether it's their fees, their bias, their lack of familiarity with the facts, or their faulty methodology, every expert has an Achilles' heel. Through creativity, determination, and, above all else, hard work, you should be able to find it. Once you become adept at doing so, you will be able to destroy any expert, every time.\\" <br />This passage comes from the very text designed to teach attorneys how to \\"destroy\\" expert witnesses. If this doesn't grab you, I would strongly suggest you find a different field of practice.<br />So, how does the expert witness proceed? Preparation, preparation, and more preparation. In addition, there are many sources of reference an expert can utilize to mitigate this \\"destructive\\" attitude. Steven Babitsky and James J. Mangraviti, Jr., have made it their quest to utilize their considerable trial experience to galvanize the expert community by providing just such resources. Their latest treatise, CROSS-EXAMINATION: THE COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE FOR EXPERTS is a marvelous example of just such a resource. Published in 2003, this book is destined to become an invaluable addition to an expert's library.<br />In the Preface, the authors state, \\"This book has been written to be an expert's comprehensive and advanced guide to excelling at the art of responding to cross-examination.\\" They have succeeded in highfashion. Like most of their previous offerings, the authors provide numerous examples of question and answer exchanges along with the requisite \\"lesson\\" from each exchange. <br />The authors reserve 117 pages of this book for a chapter titled, \\"What Experts Can Expect To Be Asked on Cross-Examination,\\" one filled with representative question and answer exchanges. These exchanges cover a variety of areas, which are the subject of hard-line questions an expert can expect. A few of these areas are bias, qualifications, prior testimony and writings, honesty and credibility and interaction with retaining counsel. Each of these potential lines of impeachment is covered with various question and answer examples and the requisite lesson. This chapter is probably one most experts will want to revisit when preparing for difficult cases or when facing an attorney with a reputation for being hard on experts. <br />The last chapter of the book is reserved for what the authors describe as becoming a dangerous expert. This is defined as \\"an expert who is highly resistant to cross-examination and who is able to take advantage of the opportunity to turn the tables on opposing counsel.\\" The dangerous expert is one who concerns opposing counsel, who produces very few positive results for opposing counsel and who can easily trigger a backfire to opposing counsel on cross-examination. These experts are deemed uncommon and in high demand. Albeit the shortest chapter in the book, it is one of the most powerful.<br />As advertised, this book is comprehensive at 399 pages however, don't let the length of the book fool you. It flows very smoothly and is absorbing with the voluminous question and answer passages. The chapters contained in this book are:<br />Chapter 1 - Introduction and Executive Summary<BR>Chapter 2 - How an Attorney Prepares to Cross-Examine an Expert<BR>Chapter 3 - How to Prepare for Cross-Examination<BR>Chapter 4 - How Jurors Perceive Cross-Examination of the Expert<BR>Chapter 5 - Advanced Cross-Examination Techniques for Experts<BR>Chapter 6 - What Experts can expect to be asked on Cross-Examination<BR>Chapter 7 - Legal Limitations to the Scope of Cross-Examination<BR>Chapter 8 - Defeating Counsel's Cross-Examination Tactics<BR>Chapter 9 - How to Answer Trick and Difficult Questions<BR>Chapter 10 - How to Become a Dangerous Expert Witness<br />The only criticism I have for this offering would be Chapter 7 - Legal Limitations to the Scope of Cross-Examination. This chapter provides a variety of case citations relative to a variety of situations and reads more like a legal textbook than the rest of chapters. That said, it will provide the expert with case cites relative to specific situations that an expert could use in testimony. <br />As stated in the opening, it is my belief this book is destined to become a staple in any expert's library. Once read, it will provide an invaluable reminder to every expert when preparing for a trial or deposition.	2003-11-02

Becoming a specialist in one's field is a typical goal when questioning one of his/her aspirations. In many cases, you'll receive the answer, \\"...to become the best.\\" (Love those willing to lay it all out!) If one's goal is to be a specialist, one must adhere to a few simple principals, principals composing vigilant and unending education. This individual will be current, well read, and extremely competent (in significantly most cases) in their chosen field. Many would call this individual an \\"expert\\" in his/her particular field. An accurate characterization indeed yet still green where the legal community is concerned. Capitalizing on this expertise is the mantra of Dan Poynter's, THE EXPERT WITNESS HANDBOOK. <br />Many \\"experts\\" have no interest in utilizing their knowledge in a legal setting. Frankly, at times, I don't blame them. However, being an expert in a particular field has its limitations relative to continuing challenges. Thus, many experts seek new, invigorating challenges. Those who have chosen to become testifying expert witnesses have most likely found the invigoration sought for displaying your knowledge in a courtroom is one of the greatest tests of that knowledgebase and your ability to articulate it. A daunting combination to be sure yet incredibly satisfying. I've been providing expert consulting and expert testimony services for close to ten years now. To say it is still a challenge and one that moves my adrenals into high gear is an understatement. However, it is one of the great highs relative to intellectual discourse and can be extremely financially rewarding.<br />THE EXPERT WITNESS HANDBOOK is the bridge between being an expert in one's field and displaying that expertise in a court of law. Dan Poynter has provided those interested in taking this bold step with a basic set of guidelines and recommendations relative to turning one's knowledge into a new (part-time or, in some cases, full-time) career path. In the first chapter, \\"What is anExpert Witness?\\" Mr. Poynter identifies what an expert witness does and why. However, this chapter's high point is the answers to his question, Why would anyone want to be an expert witness? Mr. Poynter goes on to answer these in fine detail; I'll just provide the base answer. In order: 1) To capitalize on your years of education and experience; 2) To get into the action (See! This is what expert thrive on.); 3) To put something back into the system; 4) To be hired to study (nirvana for life students); and 5) To make money.<br />From the first chapter forward, Mr. Poynter lays out a relatively clean chronology of the steps necessary for a \\"specialist\\" to become an \\"expert.\\" Although every chapter will be important and vital to the neophyte expert, there are several chapters I would like to highlight as being germane and crucial to the seasoned expert as well. Chapter 7, \\"Maintaining Competence,\\" is an almost laconic albeit important chapter advising the expert to continue to learn. For those who are eternal students, this will not be an issue. However, as a friendly warning, if one jumps into the expert arena and feels as though \\"I've made it,\\" disaster looms for laws relative to experts change constantly as do the standards and landscape of one's field of expertise. Take this chapter to heart.<br />Probably the most important chapter and one ALL experts can refer to in the future is Chapter 11, \\"The Trial,\\" although Chapter 10, \\"The Deposition\\" runs a very close second. In \\"The Trial,\\" Mr. Poynter takes 50 pages of this 231-page book to describe the process and provide poignant Q&amp;A between an expert and attorney on direct examination and the dreaded cross-examination. Mr. Poynter provides an excellent description of the process, the requisite preparation, and the actual flow of one's testimony. Before and after each Q&amp;A, he espouses his opinion and advice to the reader, advice to be well heeded in most instances.<br />Overall, this is an excellent treatiseon entering the expert witness arena. One area, in my opinion, Mr. Poynter did not cover in sufficient detail was the need for the aspiring expert to understand various points of case law relative to each expert specifically, the Daubert decision and its progeny. Although the intent of Mr. Poynter's book most likely was describe in sufficient detail the steps one must take to become a competent expert, the Daubert decision (and its progeny) are tantamount to any expert's acceptance in a court of law. Regardless, Mr. Poynter has written a very solid book and one I would recommend highly.	2003-09-21

The new edition (15th) of THE CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE is the Bible for writers (I can't speak for editors or publishers but since this prize solves most writing conundrums, it must work well for those reviewing the written word). As I've used the 14th edition for some time, I was somewhat dubious about giving up my well-oiled saftey blanket. Keep the safety blanket and buy the 15th also. The 15th implements a variety of changes befitting current wisdom; a must in today's literary world. As has been the modus operandi for some time now, the 15th edition of CMS is still in the relatively unattractive orange dust jacket but has been \\"brightened\\" inside with two ink tones. Contrary to another reviewer, I find the ink offset to be quite helpful. <br />One of the more useful additions to the 15th CMS is the paramenters addressed relative to citations from electronic publications. In the internet age, this is a must for technical and non-fiction writers. Additionally and as mandated by most interpretations of copyright law, whenever one draws from another's work, one must provide documentation. CMS follows a basic documentation style for either footnotes or endnotes. This documentation would include direct quotes, paraphrases or someone else's words or ideas, and facts and figures. <br />As a writer of technical articles, I use this manual as a guide through the morass of style. An article can be poorly written but sparkle with style and grammar. This article will, at the very least, garner some respect. A kick-bum article delving into the meat of a timely subject, yet penned with poor grammar and distasteful style, will be look upon with disdain. <br />If you're going to write, spend the bucks for CMS. It will be the best investment relative to broad acceptance of your published words.	2003-09-18

Silva was/is the guru of mind control and has recently branched out into developing the public's ESP through seminars and online self-promotion. Well, it is what it is and everyone will be their own judge. Regardless, for me, Silva gave me some things to think about. I wouldn't call it revolutionary but in hindsight, it is priceless. The gem I'm speaking of stress release through meditation/imagery (or whatever you want to term it). This has been an on-again, off-again affair for me. Like most, as life gets hectic, I tend to ignore the needs of stress release...which is when I most need it. As professional life amalgamates with personal life, we could all use a mechanism to remove our physical bodies from the mental inner voice, which keeps us stoked for action. Some use relentless exercise, some use meditation, some use television. After running upon Robert Simon Sigel's book, SIX SECONDS TO TRUE CALM, it brought back the memories of actively pursuing a stressless existence (although a fervent belief in my college days, stresslessness is just a nebulous goal now, but a goal nevertheless).<br />As several reviewers have commented, when one first finds ANYTHING to assist in stress relief, they find it cathartic and precious. It becomes utopic. And, as one lone reviewer pointed out, &quot;breathe deeply, relax...&quot; is transparent and useless. Regardless one's stance on a subject, finding the meaning in any concept or theory is within oneself and is very personal. Consequently, it does not surprise me that the reviews of this book would weigh either end of the spectrum as opposed to the typical 'Bell Curve' model observed with most reviewed works.<br />As I noted in my title, Siegel does not break any new ground with this offering. Bringing one's physical being under control is tantamount to any real mental relaxation; this concept is a given and relatively universal. Thus, deep breathing and consciousmuscle relaxation (i.e. physical factors) is the core of psychological relaxation (i.e. mental factors). Siegel identifies and goes to great lengths to instruct the reader as to proper breathing exercises to achieve optimal results for the relaxation therapy (mediation, if you will). Again, if one has never been instructed in breathing exercises, this will most likely prove fruitful.<br />Imagery plays a major role in any self-actualization process and Siegel's instruction is no different. What one believes and can image, one can make so, or so the theory goes. One factor anyone can get their arms around, regardless their belief(s) in meditation/mind control, humans only use a small percentage of the brain's capacity. Scientists have investigated and researched this phenomenon for decades without any real empirical evidence or explanation. Armed with that knowledge, why anyone would choose NOT to believe there is more &quot;out there&quot; than what our feeble minds can imagine is beyond me. The simplest analogy is the technological revolution. If our minds were stuck in a loop, why wouldn't we have had the personal computer in the early 1900s? Or, conversely, why would be have it now? This is a conundrum that could be debated ardently for days. Regardless, an open mind, relative to any new concept or theory, is the variable associated with any possible success or breaking of new ground.<br />Siegal's book is not a panacea. It will not bring you happiness within a vaccum. However, if the techniques he preaches provide just a modicum of stress release over what you currently experience, it is easily worth the price of the book. As there is no Fountain of Youth, there is no EASY universal remedy for stress. However, with an open mind and diligence of practice, one truly can provide their inner soul with some level of relief from the gators nipping at our ankles (i.e. the stresses of everyday life).<br />If you can read with an open mind to new ideas and concepts, jump into this book with both feet. If you're an eternal skeptic and cynic, pass (although I am definitely a cynic, I think I experienced openness of mind early enough in life to allow new concepts to run my grey matter before I poo-poo them off).	2003-08-24
US	52631726	R271EXTYWBEKT9	0312289901	969649163	Robert Ludlum's The Altman Code: A Covert-One Novel	Books	4	14	16	N	N	Too much criticism; Open your mind and enjoy	Growing up with Ludlum and as an ardent fan, I too have been extremely critical of these co-authored books. So much so that I decided to research exactly how much of the Covert One offerings were Ludlum and how much belonged to the co-author. As I soon discovered Ludlum ostensibly framed the idea for each of the novels but the co-author, whether it be Gayle Lynds or Philip Shelby, actually penned the novel, I felt betrayed. When I thought I was getting a Ludlum and it was only his outline, obviously then, the story must wonk. After all, it wasn't written by the Master. Many, if not most of my reviews of the Covert One novels have reflected that attitude. But, with a bit of time, an open mind, and an understanding that Mr. Ludlum is gone, I've come to enjoy these novels. Now, to set the record straight, Lynds and Shelby aren't Ludlum but, the books are solid offerings. And, to boot, Lynds and Shelby actually worked with the Master, which gives them some insight into his psyche and style. So, enjoy a novel for its intended purpose...entertainment!<br />THE ALTMAN CODE is the fourth offering in the Covert-One series, three penned by Gayle Lynds and one by Philip Shelby. In this book, our hero, Army Lieutenant Colonel and Covert-One operative Jon Smith is sent to unearth the shipping manifest of a Chinese ship rumored to be sailing for Iraq (timely event) with chemical-grade weapons materials. The U.S., already saddled with a black eye and international outrage over the boarding of a previous Chinese ship thought to be carrying illegal contraband, is not about to board this vessel without the requisite proof...the manifest. The timing could not be worse as the U.S. and China are on the precipice of signing a groundbreaking human rights treaty and entering a new period of open exchange and commerce. Smith's mission becomes tantamount to world peace.<br />As Smith arrives in China, he is immediately engaged in a gun battle with unknown assailants, a gun battle claiming the life of his contact and only source of information relative to the manifest. As Smith begins the search for answers, the unknown assailants materialize with each step he takes. To add to the prescient action, U.S. President Castilla is presented with the unfathomable...his biolgoical father, who he thought dead since his childhood, is reportedly being held in a Chinese prison as a political prisoner...and has been for 50 years! As Castilla orders a Navy frigate to shadow the ship sailing for Iraq, the Chinese match wits with the U.S. miltary mind by sending a submarine to shadow the frigate. As the story winds, matters rapidly deteriorate to the brink of the unthinkable: a U.S.-Chinese war. Like most Ludlum and, now, Covert One novels, a diabolical cabal is introduced as the dark side.<br />The storyline is complex (like a Ludlum novel) and presents some serious twists, some quite unforeseen (gotta love those!). As such, one must give co-author Lynds credit for bringing the intrigue to the forefront and managing what can be a very slippery slope, the complex plot. Lynds also portrays, in 'eyes wide open' fashion, the impressive and daunting presence of China as a world Superpower along with its devious political manipulations, vast populace, countless dialects and complex codes of behavior.<br />Net, net, it's not Ludlum. But, if one enjoys complex intrigue and international settings, Lynds does a solid job of delivering. Enjoy it; it's just entertainment.	2003-08-24

Well, we have two gentlemen to thank for this piece of work, Mr. Ludlum's long time agent, Henry Morrison and his editor, Keith Kahla. With a reported 90% of the manuscript completed, Messrs. Morrison and Kahla rounded out a gem in THE JANSON DIRECTIVE; this book rings true to the REAL Ludlum as opposed to the \\"Covert One\\" series carrying his name. This storyline has the same content, feel, flair, and panache as Ludlum's classics (PARSIFAL MOSAIC, THE MATARESE CIRCLE, The BOURNE series...), which makes sense in that he wrote the vast majority of THE JANSON DIRECTIVE. I guess true Ludlumites will be hoping Mr. Ludlum left behind several more uncompleted manuscripts to quench our endless thirst for his works. Regardless, THE JANSON DIRECTIVE certainly was a nice surprise.<br />For those unfamiliar with Ludlum, the basic premise of most of his thrillers is to create an arguable hero, a villanous cabal or individual, and place our hero against impossible odds. The price of failure? The fate of the world. <br />Our hero in THE JANSON DIRECTIVE is Paul Janson, a legendary superspook retired from the clandestine covert agency where he made his career. His taste for brutality and violence bitter, the loss of his wife and the desire to live a solitary existence, Janson joins the ranks of the entrepreneur and hires himself out as an industrial consultant. The peaceful life takes a turn south when he is contacted by a representative of the Liberty Foundation, a private organization devoted to peace and democracy throughout the world. The Foundation's founder and nobel prize-winning laureate, Peter Novak, has been kidnapped and is scheduled to be publicly executed...by the same terrorist group responsible for his wife's death. Janson has another reason to consider reactivation; Novak was personally resonsible for saving Janson's life many years ago and Janson is not one to forget a debt owed. Without hesitation, Janson assembles a team of star operatives to rescue Novak.<br />The mission, against incredible and overwhelming odds, is a success until, moments after Janson bids farewell to his team and Novak, the escape helicopter explodes into a fiery ball of flames as Janson watches. His team, his friend and star pupil, and Novak-gone in a flash. As Janson tries to piece together WHY?, he finds himself marked for death in nearly every city he passes through. Janson believes it must be operatives of the terrorist group seeking revenge for his part in the daring rescue of Novak. However, Janson soon realizes his would-be assassins are American! As the storyline builds, Janson saves one of his latent assassins from rape and certain death. This act creates doubt in the assassin, Jessica Kincaid. As soon as Janson realizes that Kincaid works for the same agency from which he retired, his peerless instincts kick in, making Jason an inexorable opponent for his former agency. <br />As with most TRUE Ludlum novels, the plot devinely twists and turns keeping the reader absorbed in the storyline until the final twist at climax.<br />While the Covert One series maintains the broad brush \\"ideas\\" of Ludlum, these books are not true Ludlum books. Do not be mistaken, the Covert One authors, Gayle Lynds and Philip Shelby, are fine writers and understand the mechanics of the spy/mystery genre. However, those of us who grew up reading Ludlum know the Covert One books are a mere shadow of what was. Lynds and Shelby lack the characterization and panache of the master; we can only hope they continue to aspire to his literary summit. Kudos again to Messrs. Morrison and Kahla for briefly quenching an insatiable deire for more of Ludlum's gems. Here's hoping there are more.	2003-07-20

If not, Dan Solin's book, DOES YOUR BROKER OWE YOU MONEY? is an excellent primer for those wanting to understand the 'inside skinny' of the brokerage business, responsibilities of brokers, alternatives to aggreived investors and possibilities for recovery if damaged.<br />I've been in the litigation consulting game (as a consulting and testifying expert) for close to a decade now, primarily in securities, and can say that Solin's book is the first book I've run across bringing all the pieces together in a cogent manner. While other books are out there and new ones arriving daily, Solin's book stands out as the cream of this crop. {Solin, a plaintiff's attorney, has been in the game for 30+ years. There will be and are many who will think this is his personal soapbox to drum up more business. I fervently disagree. Solin presents a solid, fact-based picture of many of the misdeeds inflicted by unscrupulous brokers. There is very little fluff here.}<br />Solin walks the reader through most aspects of a relationship with a broker as well as identifying the \\"warning signs\\" within the relationship for any investor to observe. In the first chapter, \\"Your Broker Just Might Owe You Money,\\" Solin describes the 'chatter' many brokers use to market themselves and pick off unsuspecting investors. He then goes on to describe areas of broker fraud and NYSE/NASD/SEC violations, which he details in later chapters.<br />If there is one chapter I would strongly suggest most retail investors read and reread, it is Chapter 4, \\"Unsuitability: What's a Good Investment Strategy for You?\\" By and large, most lawsuits I've consulted/testified in have allegations of unsuitable investments. Simplisticly, unsuitability can be defined as a broker's disregard for an investor's risk tolerance and investment objectives. This disregard is primarily manifested in recommendations from a broker to buy a stock considered outside the risk paramters and investment objectives.For instance, many retired individuals have an IRA or 401(K) account with a broker. In most cases, these accounts are very conservative and thus, have a risk profile of 'conservative' and investment objectives to match (i.e. 'safety of principal' and 'income' are the primary investment objectives). An unsuitability claim would arise if a broker induced/encouraged/suggested a stock considered outside these parameters, say, ones fitting the 'growth' profile or 'aggressive growth' profile. In any event, this practice, particularly during the \\"Bubble\\" was prevalent as many investors wanted to participate in the market boom and were easy prey to rougish brokers.<br />In later chapters, Solin describes the lawsuit process, which is actually an arbitration process. Significantly all investors, when signing their new account papers with a brokerage house, agree to binding arbitration to settle disputes as opposed to having their dispute heard state or federal court. The arbitration process is simpler, quicker (in most cases), and less formal...but don't be mistaken, it is still a lawsuit and the stress and high intensity is still omnipresent. Solin does an excellent job of describing the process beginning with contacting an attorney and ending with the arbitration panel's decision. Within these chapters, Solin describes those investors wishing to \\"go it alone,\\" filing a suit without an attorney. Solin gives this a fair level of play, which I admire in an attorney however, he strongly suggests (and I stronlgy concur) that anyone seeking compensation under a securities lawsuit hire the best attorney one can find. <br />Finally, Solin provides an excellent glossary and bibliography, one that should be used for future reference.<br />After reading this book, I easily rate this book 5 stars for it's clear and concise explanation, one appealing to the leity and professionals alike. Several reviews of this book describe Solin as a \\"talking head\\" or the champion of those not wishing to take responsibility for their own actions. While there is credence in the fact that many investors, while losing their proverbial shirts, are solely responsible for their losses, there are many, many investors who have been duped and even defrauded by their brokers and brokerage houses (remember the 4/28/03 SEC settlement with the 10 large brokerage houses?). Contrary to these reviewers, I believe Solin gives fair play to those responsible for their own losses and those not responsible. In any event, in my practice, I have no interest in frivolous cases and reject cases lacking merit. Inasmuch as I didn't find Solin's book unconscionable, I don't believe it to be fodder for the attorney lobby.<br />A very good read.	2003-07-13

A number of years ago, I read Roger von Oech's A WHACK ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD. It was fairly early in my career, when the mold is still unformed but the message was poignant. Recently, when I ran across EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED and saw von Oech was the author, I decided to pick it up and renew myself to von Oech's teachings. What a breath of fresh air he offers with EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED.<br />von Oech draws heavily upon the ancient wisdom of Heraclitus, the Greek philosopher. Heraclitus, like Parmenides, postulated a model of nature and the universe which created the foundation for all other speculation on physics and metaphysics. The ideas that the universe is in constant change and there is an underlying order or reason to this change-the Logos-form the essential foundation of the primary Heraclitean view. Everytime one walks into a science, economics, or political science course, at most any level, significantly all the teachings originate with Heraclitus's speculations on change and the Logos.<BR>Despite this and the fact the ancient Greeks considered Heraclitus one of their principal philosophers, precious little remains of his writings. The passages remaining are tremendously obtuse, not because they are quoted out of context, but because Heraclitus deliberately cultivated an obscure writing style (one that makes one THINK!). However, thanks to von Oech's passion for all that is Heraclitus and his teachings, we are presented with many the ancient 'riddles' and a modern day correlation and translation of each. von Oech recalls being struck with &quot;the Heraclitean bug&quot; while studying in Germany many years ago. Now, he has written a book in which he brilliantly and entertainingly examines concepts such as symbol, paradox, and ambiguity in relation to creative thought. <br />At the beginning of EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED, von Oech provides the reader with 30 creative insights to consider and explore our creative psyches. von Oech goes through each of the thirtyselected epigrams, provides his interpretation along with examples, parables, and questions-the kind that make you go &quot;Hmmm&quot;- all the while stoking the creative being within. von Oech does not attempt to inform the reader that his interpretation is the correct one; to the contrary, he implores the reader to step outside the boundries of conventional thought to find the &quot;correct&quot; answer. <br />As he was in A WHACK ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD, von Oech is immensely entertaining. He is an individual who has spent his career assisting others to think creatively. As a byproduct of this career, von Oech has proven himself to be a prodigous creative thinker in his own right. Those in the 'concrete' professions-attorneys, consultants, accountants-will find this book extremely insightful. Thinking in the abstract is incongruent with the 'concrete' professions (I know, I'm one of them). As such, having the fodder to stoke the creative juices, particularly when problem-solving, is a boon to any professional.<br />At it's small physical size and only 190-odd pages, this book is perfect to keep handy at your desk or any place one engages in thought. I plan to keep it nearby just to refer to when a problem presents itself in an ostensibly unsolvable manner.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-06-16

Corporate casual for me is basically slacks, shirt, sport coat, no tie. However, there are times one must go completely dressed and in these instances, books like DRESSING THE MAN are outstanding to teach those of us who are style challenged the art of matching threads. (I recently read and reviewed CASUAL POWER by Sherry Maysonave. For those in the corporate casual line as I described, this is an outstanding book.) <br />My biggest downfall is the total lack of sense in putting outfits together. OK, if I have a suit, no problem. But, how about patterned slacks...what shirt? What jacket? Socks? You get the idea. DRESSING THE MAN solves most of the mysteries and, quite frankly, opened my eyes as well. It seems as though symmetry is not necessarily a mandate as long as the style has precendent. Patterned slacks and patterned socks for instance. Many of our '40s and '50s movie stars were into this scene. Were they ridiculed? Nope, just copied. <br />Many of the corporate stalwarts of old have moved to a more casual theme in recent years, creating the move toward comfort over dominion. Could the stodgiest be modifying, changing with the times? By contrast, how many suits do you think were even owned by the Silicon Valley tech generation of the '80s and '90s? Now, that has changed and the tech crowd, many out of work, are looking for new work...and buying suits for their interviews to ensure they are being taken seriously. Most of these style barbarians had no clue as to the style, coordination or even expectations of dress. Alan Flusser to the rescue. In '85, Flusser wrote the critically acclaimed, CLOTHES AND THE MAN, which could be called the predecessor to DRESSING THE MAN. With this offering, no man should have an excuse for being a style freak.<br />DRESSING THE MAN is chock-full of illustrations, pictures, and suggestions. You'll see vintage photos of Gary Cooper, Errol Flynn, Cary Grant, Fred Astaire and many more. Most of these pics look like they jumped right off the pages of GQ. Flusser offers a variety of suggestions relating to choosing suits, shirts and ties and takes it as far as coordinating your outfits with skin tone, hair color, and body type. Shoes, socks, wristwatches, and even hats are covered.<br />If you're interested in reading a book on men's dress and learning the styles, DRESSING THE MAN fits the bill quite nicely. If you are interested in reading a book on men's styles AND you want to read it in bed or perhaps on a plane ride, this is not your book. At a full 8.5 x 11 inches, 320 pages and at least 5 pounds, this is not a book to lug around.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-06-13

After spending a summer in Northern Minnesota as a child, I felt I would make it back some day...hopefully to stay or at least build a vacation home. I'm not shy about sharing this 'dream' with close friends so it came as no surprise when a buddy of mine suggested I read ARCTIC HOMESTEAD before I became too giddy about the North. <br />Norma and Les Cobb came together in a second marriage for both, with the added baggage of 5 children between them. In an effort to make a life for themselves and their childre, they decided to leave the Lower 48 behind and claim a homestead in Canada. Along the way, they found out only a Canadian citizen could file for homestead in Canada at that time. Undeterred, they soon determined that Alaska still had homestead provisions so they set their sights for Alaska, a home and a new life.<br />Norma and Les find their previously unseen homestead just south of the Arctic Circle. Thus begins their story of striving to beat the homestead clock of improving the land and creating commerce within 5 years of filing the homestead papers. Along the way, they face one of their sons being accidentally shot, a derelict (and former friend) attempting to kill Les, coming face-to-face with black and grizzly bears, dealing with the Bushman (a/k/a Bigfoot), prospecting for gold, holding off ravenous wolves, and, of course, last but certainly not least, the indomitable cold and snow. Through it all, Norma and Les persevere and overcome each challenge faced.<br />This factual novel was written by Mr. Sasser, a very gifted storyteller, the source document of which was Norma's journal. Norma maintained enough detail to allow Mr. Sasser to write an extremely complete and entertaining novel. It cannot be said that the veracity of Norma's recollections are without challenge. Ken Nelson, who Norma speaks of in Chapters 66 and 67, wrote a review of the hardback versionof ARCTIC HOMESTEAD. Mr. Nelson is quite candid regarding his version of the events versus those told by Norma/Mr. Sasser. The biggest discrepancy revolves around the health of Sid's (the oldest Cobb son) dogs entrusted to Mr. Nelson when the Cobb family flew to Colorado to visit Les's ailing father. This certainly creates some uncertainty as to veracity and credence but nevertheless, this book is still a winner regardless the actual chronology of events.<br />The Cobbs still live in their small homestead in Minook Vally, AK and even have a website promoting their big game/fishing guide services ...Anyone interested in the last true frontier should immediately pick up a copy of ARCTIC HOMESTEAD. Again, regardless your views of Norma, Les and their children, this book reads incredibly easy and totally engrossing. <br />Highly recommended.	2003-06-11

The poignant analogy coming to mind is offering the book \\"Accounting for Dummies\\" to a CPA. Of course it is unsatisfying. A book like this is not aimed at seasoned professionals in the field; rather, it's intended audience is grounded in those with little or no exposure to the securities/financial fields.<br />I have been involved in securities litigation consulting for almost a decade now. As my consulting practice has grown, I have hired many individuals, most of whom are not well-versed in securities/financial jargon. In significantly all cases, these new employees feel ill-at-ease initially when reviewing case files and documentation due to the learning ramp and educational abyss. I have found if I offer them a copy of the DICTIONARY OF FINANCE AND INVESTMENT TERMS (DFIT) on their first day, the learning curve is flattened and becomes much shorter in duration. As a matter of fact, several of my employees have taken the initiative to take their DFIT home to look for particular words/phrases common to their daily routines. By derivation, this makes the employee feel much less out of place and instills some level of motivation relative to their work (this has been a definite intangible benefit to my practice).<br />I keep one in my office and although I don't crack it very often, there are times when I'm not as familiar with a word/phrase and then, I rely on DFIT. This is similar to the situation of reading a book, seeing a word you can pronounce and know but aren't quite certain of its EXACT meaning. Let's face it, with over 5,000 entries in DFIT, most professionals, even those entrenched in the field, will find themselves fuzzy on certain words and phrases.<br />While DFIT is not a panacea, it certainly fills the void. I would recommend this book for anyone new to the finance/investment fields and most professionals who deal on the fringes of these industries. ...

I read THE JESTER and FOUR BLIND MICE over the same weekend and hands down, THE JESTER is the better storyline (actually, JESTER was a wonderful read). Perhaps the creative juices for the Cross novels has waned after so many but regardless, something is just not clicking like it used to. \\"ROSES\\" and \\"VIOLETS\\" were marginal books while 1ST TO DIE and 2ND TO DIE were just a notch above. It is my hope that Patterson will find the juices again...and soon.<br />FOUR BLIND MICE opens with Cross' long-time partner and friend, John Sampson, requesting Alex's help to investigate the murder conviction of one of Sampson's Army buddies. Ellis Cooper, Sampson's buddy, has been accused, tried and convicted of the murder of three women along with the bizarre arrangement and paintng of the bodies. Cooper has been sentenced to die by lethal injection; the execution is set to be administered in three short weeks and Sampson believes only his friend and supersleuth Cross can unravel the injustice befalling Cooper. As Cross begins his investigation, he runs into one stone wall after another but hasn't quite determined if those are Army walls (i.e. \\"we take care of our own\\") or something quite different. Although doggedly determined, Alex cannot crack the case and Ellis Cooper is executed. The one and only piece of evidence Cross has is the eyewitness account of a teenage boy who indicated he saw three men outside the home of the murder victims that night. However, Alex was never able to corroborate this statement.<br />As the story continues, Patterson introduces the reader to three very skillful and very sick assassins. Even before Cooper's execution, the reader knows these \\"THREE BLIND MICE\\" are responsible for the triple homicide. As time passes, the Mice continue their spree but it is definitely not for kicks. It appears there is a puppetmaster; one who has given the Mice their marching orders albeit mercenary orders at that. This portion of the story winds throughout the book until the end where it fizzles without much surprise or intrigue. The climax is satisfying but certainly not surprising.<br />Two very poignant subplots revolve around the love lives of Cross and Sampson, nothing really new for Alex but quite unconventional for Sampson. True to VIOLETS, Jamilla Hughes returns as Alex's love interest. And, as always and timeless, Alex still has Nana Mama to care for his three children including his infant son, Alex.<br />All-in-all, a decent book but I find myself waiting for the next great Cross book. Something in the spirit of KISS THE GIRLS. I haven't given up on Patterson and I certainly will continue to check out his newer \\"off-Cross\\" books. As I mentioned, I found the JESTER to be a fabulous read, a storyline and subject matter totally different to Patterson's norm. It's proof that Patterson has the skill yet it seems he has turned his efforts more into a Stephen King-like machine, pumping out one book after another. While this satisfies the volume requirement for fans, it is obvious that quality has taken a fairly staunch hit.<br />Worth the read but not his best.albeit mercenary orders at that.

After reading many of the reviews of this book, it is apparent that many Patterson fans want him to stay in the crime/suspense/mystery genre. It is also apparent that many have no desire for 'history-based' fiction. Consequently, I fear my review will be quite unpopular as I thought THE JESTER was an outstanding effort by Patterson. However, I must admit that I'm something of a Crusade/Arthurian junkie.<br />Present Day...<br />Dr. Alberto Mazzini, Director of the Vatican Museum is urgently called to the Musee d'Histoire in Boree', France. Renee Lacaze, Director of the Boree' Museum, has summoned Dr. Mazzini to analyze a relic, ostensibly a holy relic from the time of Christ. Ms. Lacaze informs Mazzini that the artifact was unearthed during the excavation for a shopping center when the excavation machinery opened a sarcophagus. Lacaze goes on to say that the grave belonged to a long-forgotten duke who died in 1098. This duke fought in the Crusades and was known to seek out relics from the time of Christ. <br />Lacaze said, \\"The local lore, it always said a precious relic was here. Just never that it belonged to a duke. But to a man of far more humble origins.\\" <br />\\"What sort of lowborn man would come into such a prize? A priest?

Veille du Pere is under the power of a ruthless and cowardly noble, Baldwin, the Duke of Treille. <br />Fervently desiring to be free, Hugh joins a thrown-together army to fight in the Crusades. Almost two years later, Hugh returns to his village to find that all the homes have burned and the village plundered by Baldwin's knights. It was said they were in search of a precious relic dating back to the Crucifixion and was in the possession of Hugh de Luc. Hugh also learns the knights kidnapped Sophie and murdered their one-year old son, a son he didn't even know he had.<br />Disillusioned and fierily resolute, Hugh sets out to find Sophie and exact revenge on those responsible, an undertaking making him appear quite mad. During his search, Hugh takes on the \\"pretext\\" of a jester in an effort to infiltrate Baldwin's castle, where he is certain Sophie is held captive. During the ensuing weeks, Hugh becomes known throughout France, and NOT as a Jester.<br />As I mentioned, this is an era I thoroughly enjoy and find fascinating. There are so many magical moments, characters and events. It is also one of the most Barbaric times in our world's history (in the same fashion as Braveheart). Patterson, and co-author Gross, manage to make this story magical. While most of the events and characters are based in fiction, the storyline manages to engross the history buff in me albeit one taking each sentence with a grain of salt. However, the research performed by Patterson/Gross was fairly prodigious as evidenced by the historical references provided.<br />Bottom line, this is an enjoyable, well-written book. Sure, it is not historically accurate but then again, it is a work of fiction. I applaud Mr. Patterson for taking the risk of moving into unfamiliar territory and challenging himself and his readership. It is my hope we will see more of this type of work although I have no interest in losing the \\"Cross\\" novels for historical fiction. <br />A great read. Open your mind and you'll enjoy this offering.	2003-06-03

I rarely rate a book with 5 stars but this book richly deserves it for in succinct breadth and witty storytelling. In his wild expose, WALL STREET MEAT, Andy Kessler gives the reader a behind-the-scenes view of the antics of some of Wall Street's giants. The subtitle tells it all: Grubman, Quattrone, Meeker and Blodgett and Andy Kessler's relationships and experiences with each. To those even somewhat familiar with the SEC action of April 28, 2003, these names will stand out. MEAT tells us more, much more.<br />Andy Kessler began his career as an electrical engineer designing microchips at Bell Labs. By some strange quirk of fate (or brainless move by a headhunter), he was thrown into the world of a Wall Street analyst. Kessler has seen more than most; his Wall Street career began before the infamous &quot;Black Monday&quot; crash (October 19, 1987) and spanned into the beginning of the Internet Bubble. During that time, Kessler met and worked with the individuals now being targeted for prosecution for their &quot;exuberant&quot; activities. Kessler went at it elbow-to-elbow with Jack Grubman while at PaineWebber (Grubman eventually moved on to Salomon Smith Barney); with Frank Quattrone (and Mary Meeker...truly a bit player here) while at Morgan Stanley (Quattrone eventually moved to Deutsche Bank and then to CSFB); and became well acquainted with Henry Blodgett AFTER Kessler turned in his analyst hat for that of a venture capitalist.<br />Kessler goes to great lengths to inform the reader of the trials and tribulations of the Wall Street analyst in the 80's and most of the 90's. The difficulties and reticence he would feel each time he would put a &quot;Buy&quot; or &quot;Sell&quot; recommendation on a company are richly described as gnashing of teeth and firestorms. In this age, an analyst had to defend each recommendation as the Street's skepticism &quot;appeared&quot; to demand it. Conversely, as the Internet phenomenon hit the scenes, the code of the analyst changed from one of cautious recommendation to one of mindless, obtuse &quot;dartthrowing.&quot; Although he provides us with many gems, Kessler recounts one poignant conversation with Blogett wherin Blodgett posits: &quot;You've got to understand. If I stop recommending a stock, and the shares keep going up, there is hell to pay. Brokers call you up and yell at you for missing more of the upside. Bankers yell at you for messing up their relationships. There is just too much risk in not recommending these stocks.&quot; A perfect example of the mindset and excesses bringing Wall Street to its knees. In another conversation, now considered germane and somewhat paradoxical (given the chronology of events), Kessler recounts Quattrone's tutelage of the invisible &quot;Chinese Wall.&quot; This &quot;Wall&quot; is a conceptual separation of research and investment banking designed to prevent insider information passing from bankers to analysts. Ironically, the breaching of this &quot;Wall&quot; was one of the acts eventually bringing Quattrone down.<br />Kessler uses MEAT as part biography, part expose, and part satire...and does all three exceedingly well. To say this is just another &quot;tell-all&quot; book about Wall Street would be a great injustice. Kessler was there, Kessler is smart, Kessler was lucky. Above all, Kessler is hilarious. The combination makes this book an extremely enjoyable read, one most will appreciate and most importantly, learn from. A very good read, indeed.	2003-05-25
US	52631726	RS0P2HKSYLUPO	0609608444	517121775	The Devil in the White City:  Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America	Books	4	4	5	N	N	World's Fair in histrionics; Ripper lore to boot	I must give Erik Larson his due; anyone gutsy enough to undertake a diverse dichotomous project such as THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY, and pull it off no less, should be lauded. The book, as a whole is a good read. Had the two stories been written on a stand-alone basis...I'm not too sure this would have been been the result. The risk lies in commingling two seemingly unrelated narratives; extremely difficult.<br />Chicago's desire to be seen as a social equivalent to New York City underscored the founder's unabounded optimism and blind ambition to build the White City a/k/a the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. For those wondering why it was dubbed \\"The White City,\\" it was simply due to the fact that all the outbuildings were painted white. The book's Devil was Herman Webster Mudgett, known by many aliases but incarnated in the White City as Dr. H.H. Holmes. Mr. Larson's labeling of Holmes as the Devil is fitting in many ways.<br />Larson's nonfiction account of the vision and construction of the 1893 World's Fair is fascinating. An unprecedented collection of designers and architects were thrown together to make this a fair to be remembered. While their main focus appeared to be fixed on social equivalence with NYC, the founders wanted to ensure this fair would best the Paris fair in great strides. The man behind the vision and infrastructure was Daniel H. Burnham, one of the nation's brightest architects of the era. As a side note, the reader will find it interesting to see Frank Lloyd Wright's appearance as an apprentice albeit briefly as he was fired by the firm he worked for (incredible!). Larson goes into considerable detail relative to the vision, planning, construction, and perception of the Chicago fair. At times, the detail became baggage. At times however, it was historically enthralling. Let's face it, the 1893 fair was responsible for such timeless staples as Juicy Fruit gum, the Kodak camera, Cracker Jack, Shredded Wheat and, the coup de gras, the Ferris Wheel(named after George Washington Gale Ferris). <br />The dark side is draped in the form of H.H. Holmes, a handsome, charismatic psychopath. After reading Mr. Larson's description of Holmes, a modern day mental picture of Ted Bundy comes to mind...a smooth, deadly operator. Holmes saw the fair and it's transient population as the perfect venue to satiate his thirst for control. Given his penchant for deceitfully setting people at ease, he leveraged his way into a hotel/apartment building, the ultimate site of his atrocities. This facility was designed and constructed with its own soundproof walls, gas chamber and crematorium. His primary prey were young women although he would eventually eliminate anyone, male or female, who posed a threat to his sickness.<br />Both of this stories are large, complex, and historically interesting. Larson maintains the reader's interest by utilizing the methodology of alternating chapter narratives between the two stories. Far and away, this story is grounded in the lore of the fair. While there is great detail about Holmes and his exploits, the climax relative to this storyline is anemic. <br />Mr. Larson obviously relishes his research on the Ferris wheel, certainly an incredibly significant engineering marvel of this era. Its significance? The tallest building in Chicago during this period of time was only 14 stories. The Ferris Wheel towered at a height of 264 feet or about 25 stories. This wheel was not fitted with individual cars but with gondola-type vehicles capable of holding a large number of people...it could carry up to 2,000 people.<br />With very few pictures, THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY is a historical narrative, which depends on Mr. Larson's skill as a storyteller; a skill he has finely honed.  This is a well-researched piece of non-fiction, historical work that reads like a novel. This is a story worth telling and the reader is fortunate Mr. Larson is the medium. The only negative I saw was the anticlimactic ending tothe Holmes portion of the story.	2003-05-11
US	52631726	R3C4FWPRPDOKC7	1556817215	15368706	Expert Rules: 100 (and more) Points You Need to Know About Expert Witnesses	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Expert Rules....Rules!	EXPERT RULES was written with the attorney audience in mind. And, it would appear, if an attorney is preparing for a trial in which an expert will be used for the first time, this book would provide an excellent outline. However, I purchased it because a large portion of my consulting practice is centered around expert services including expert testimony. For the expert, this book is a gem. <br />The primary text is a short 81 pages but authors Malone (who has written other excellent books in this field) and Zwier pack an incredible amount of advice and procedure in this short space. The appendices are reserved for selected passages from the Federal Rules of Evidence (which directly apply to all identified experts) and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (identifies the protocol for experts in civil litigation).<br />Malone and Zwier lay out their treatise in the following fashion: 1) Finding an Expert, 2) Feeding an Expert (communications, discovery, etc.), 3) Expert Reports, 4) Non-Deposition Discovery about an Expert, 5) Preparing an Expert to Be Disposed (excellent insight to trial attorney tactics), 6) Deposing Expert Witnesses, 7) Admissibility of Expert Testimony, 8) Direct Examination of an Expert, 9) Constructive Cross-Examination of an Expert, 10) Destructive Cross-Examination of an Expert, 11) Experts, Summary Exhibits, Visual Aids, and Demonstrations.<br />As you can see, the authors cover quite a bit of ground even though the book is succinct. Reading from an expert point-of-view, chapters 8 and 9 were of great interest to me as they blazed the path of the typical `bait-and-switch' most attorneys pull on cross-examination. Constructive cross is the art of agreement; that is, getting the expert to agree with your positions (the attorney cross-examining the expert) and your expert's (the opposing expert) opinions. In this phase of the cross, the attorney will do everything necessary to ingratiate himself to the expert in an attempt to slide the expert into a sense of security. Then, as happens so many times in trials, the attorney immediately slips into the Destructive phase of the cross, attacking the expert's qualifications, previous trial testimony, lack of experience relative to the issue at hand, and other maladies affecting an expert from time-to-time. Just understanding these two basic concepts will aid any expert in succeeding during testimony.<br />The upshot is if an expert understands the procedure, the expert can prepare himself for these tactics and strategies. To a certain degree, it is like peeking into the opposing team's playbook. Consequently, EXPERT RULES, while written with the attorney in mind, is an excellent book for testifying experts as insight into the unknown when one places his hand on the Bible and responds, \\"I do,\\" after being asked if you promise to tell the truth.<br />My only criticism of this book is the underused practice of cross-referencing text to the Federal Rules of Evidence and Civil Procedure. Understanding these rules and knowing them \\"at the drop of a hat\\" give the expert an advantage when sitting in the witness chair. I can't blame the authors for this however, as most experts aren't interested in the process as much as they are their own product. An error in judgment, in my opinion, but one many survive. Regardless, I highly recommend this book to ANY expert preparing for deposition and/or trial testimony.	2003-04-27

Whether you are a pro at putting outfits together or a bumbling brut (me), CASUAL POWER by Sherry Maysonave will lend some insight into what's right and what's not in the world of business casual. I know a number of people able to string outfits together but making an impact or statement with non-formal clothing takes skill, taste and experience. Someone like me who has spent a small fortune on clothing to make it easier to put outfits together will really benefit from Ms. Maysonave's book. At the very least, I've made some progress in understanding clothing faux pas' and coordinating shirts, slacks, shoes and sport coats. And whether one wants to admit it or not, appearances do matter. <br />Casual (and perhaps Grunge) dress has long been the norm for high-tech environments. I consulted for a software company during the 90's that sported a dozen or so software engineers. These guys and gals had an unwritten credo to determine who could wear the most disgusting, outrageous T-shirt, on a daily basis. While it provided much-needed comic relief, it was tragic nonetheless.<br />For most men going casual, the challenge lies in locating the compromise between too stuffy and weekend slob. With the interpretation of casual so varied, Ms. Maysonave offers a general rule of thumb - remember there's a difference between casual dress and business casual dress. Additionally, no matter what one decides to wear to work, conducting business is the name of the game. For me, the need to change from \\"Dockers\\" casual to business casual came with too many unexpected client drop-ins and opportunities to meet new clients.<br />Regardless one's profession, if suit and tie aren't required, tasteful business attire is still appropriate and, in most circles, expected. This is particularly true of many of the successful individuals and those getting ahead in front of the trend.<br />CASUAL POWER is an easy-to-read book with many illustrations, color photos and tips to ensure success in dressing down powerfully. I highly recommend this book for most professionals, particularly those adhering to a casual dress code.	2003-04-24
US	52631726	R1NWFST2Z89YKZ	0385504268	354796806	The Last Detective (Elvis Cole Series)	Books	4	14	16	N	N	Scathing storyline; easy mystery	This was my first read of a Robert Crais novel; a recommendation from a friend. It won't be my last Crais novel and I owe that friend dinner. Crais' lexicon is the requisite tough \\"private dick-speak\\" but his storyline is elegant and intellectual. No offense to Mr. Spillane or Mr. Simmons but THE LAST DETECTIVE has overtones of a Mike Hammer or Joe Kurtz but is stratafied cerebrally higher. And, who can't love a hero named Elvis?<br />In strange fashion, particularly to a new reader of Crais, the prologue begins with a test of man against beast. The reader is introduced (RE-introduced for Crais vets) to Pike, who is in Alaska laser-focused on killing what is believed to be a rabid bear. The short prologue is intense but disjointed until later in the book.<br />As the book begins...<br />Our hero, Elvis Cole, is in a romantic relationship with Lucy (Luce) Chenier, an attorney cum TV personality. When Lucy takes an out-of-town assignment, she asks Elvis to sit for her 10-year old son, Ben. Before the reader is through the first few pages (subsequent to the prologue), Ben is kidnapped from the backyard of Elvis' house. Soon, Elvis receives a phone call from the kidnapper who tells him he's taken Ben as \\"payback\\" for \\"what you did\\" when Elvis was part of an Army Ranger outfit in Vietnam. <br />When the police arrive, Detective Carole Starkey and Elvis explore the slope behind his house and discover Ben's footprints stop abruptly. Upon closer inspection, Elvis finds a single heel print left in the soil by the kidnapper. As Cole continues his search, he realizes the kidnapper is extremely dangerous and will be difficult to corner. Why? Because, based on the lack of tracks or signs of struggle, Cole believes the kidnapper has a military background similar to his own, something scaring Cole to extreme levels. It's at this point Elvis summons his dark friend, Joe Pike. <br />Elvis and Lucy's relationship begins to disintegrate quickly when Lucy's super-rich ex-husband showsup and another telephone call from the kidnapper is placed, this time to Lucy. The kidnapper contends that Ben's kidnapping is Cole's fault and retribution for his atrocities in Vietnam. This immediately puts a dark spotlight on Cole generating doubt from Lucy, anger from Lucy's ex, and scrutiny from the police. Cole painfully disregards the kidnapper's allegations and sinks his teeth into the investigation with his lethal sidekick, Pike.<br />The climax of this book takes the reader into an abyss of adrenaline. Although a relatively short book, Crais has mastered the art of grabbing the reader by the heart and squeezing until the very end. Crais definitely has set the ending toward another installment in the Cole series albeit different as the relationship between Elvis and Lucy is dubious at best.<br />This is a five-star book however, there were any number of passages alludign to Cole's childhood that somewhat 'cluttered' the book. Now, this background expose may have been important to seasoned readers of Crais but to a new reader, it was filler. However, I am open to the fact that had I read the Cole novels chronologically, this may have been poignant. Regardless, this is an incredibly fast-paced, intoxicating novel, which I highly recommend.	2003-04-06
US	52631726	R20DSO21LTDDNQ	0399149775	563294014	Back Story (Spenser Mystery)	Books	4	6	8	N	N	A slow move in the right direction	Let me say first, I am honored to own all 30 Spenser novels. I consider myself a collector to be sure but a consumer first and foremost. For those new to Robert B. Parker (RBP) and Spenser, Spenser is \\"Shakespeare meets Mike Hammer (and then some).\\" What's not to like? Well, with the last few offerings, RBP has, in my opinion, slipped a bit. In his last Spenser offering, WIDOW'S WALK, I was thoroughly disappointed in the uncharacteristically slow pace and lack of Spenserisms; not to mention the total lack of identification of the killer. In BACK STORY, RBP makes a partial comeback to the wit all Spenser fans have come to love, but it is still substandard. And, call me sadistic, but where the heck is Hawk? Yes, he's still in the storyline but his role is somewhat geriatric. I enjoyed the brash, somewhat dark side of Hawk. A bit more mystery and a lot less familiarity.<br />To the story...Spenser's \\"surrogate\\" son, Paul Giacomin, turns up in Boston with a bag of Krispy Kremes and introduces Spenser to a young woman friend, Daryl Silver (nee' Gordon). Daryl asks Spenser to solve a 28-year-old murder (remember, 28, not 30-year old!!). The victim was Daryl's mother, shot to death in a Boston bank when a radical group calling itself the Dread Scott Brigade staged an armed robbery in 1974. The crime was never solved, and now Daryl has come to Spenser for closure, though his fee will have to be the price of a bag of donuts. With true Spenser brio, he readily accepts.<BR> <br />Spenser immediately begins to see the facts of the old case don't add up. For one thing, the Dread Scott Brigade allegedly took responsibility for the robbery, and there are photos of the perps. However, strangely enough, no one was ever caught. As Spenser dives deeper into the case files of the authorities, he discovers the FBI knows things it won't share, and Daryl's perpetually-stoned father has sources of income Spenser can't explain. Not only was the case seemingly dropped before it got started,it has been covered up. A key FBI intelligence report is missing from both the Boston Homicide and FBI files. And, in a contrasting twist, Spenser discovers the mob wants the case closed as well. <br />After an author successfully writes 30 novels with the same main character, achievement isn't at issue. And this story is worth the read if for no other reason than the author is RBP and the main character is Spenser. The combination is difficult to resist and I'll continue to read all of RBP's Spenser iterations. However, and this will be unpopular, RBP is not focusing on Spenser and Hawk in the fashion he used to. Pinpointing my issue, Spenser's wit is present but laconic relative to past offerings. Hawk is present but impotent relative to past offerings. The ending, well, let's just say it passed with a wimper. Not the usual RBP blast.<br />All-in-all, BACK STORY is worth the read if one is a Spenser fan. However, in this reviewer's opinion, this book just barely reaches the 4-star level. I'm hoping for more wit and action in the next offering.	2003-03-23

While this is certainly a niche book and one very few in the Amazon world will read, for those few who are professionals, whether in the litigation consulting arena or not, this text provides an over-the-top treatise on the right and wrong ways of providing testimony under deposition. Further, regardless desire, chances are that many professionals will be called upon to give a deposition at some point in their professional careers given the litigous society in which we live. HTEDD is a small investment that will pay off in spades.<br />The authors, Babitsky and Mangraviti, could be described as the \\"Expert's Expert.\\" Together, they lead an organization devoted to assisting the expert in understanding the law relative to expert testimony and provide insight into tactics used by attorneys in depositions and trial scenarios. Both attorneys, Babitsky and Mangraviti, are, in fact, experts in providing this tutelage. <br />The nine chapters in this book are:<br />1.  Deposition Law and Procedure - overviews of the law pertaining to depositions, the discovery process, attorney-client privilege and how that affects the expert, and general decorum during depositions;<br />2.  Why Experts are Deposed - this chapter provides the various reasons opposing counsel wished to take an expert's deposition and the types of probing questions the expert can expect;<br />3.  Preparing for Your Deposition - this chapter stresses the importance of PREPARATION...mastering the facts and understanding the expert's role;<br />4.  Subpoenas/Duces Tecum and Use of Documents at Deposition - explains the different types of subpoenas experts will receive and the proper handling of documents before, during and after a deposition;<br />5.  Answering Counsel's Questions - this is an all-important chapter as it provides actual examples of what to doand what not to do given certain scenarios of probable lines of questioning;<br />6.  Deposition Advice for Expert Witnesses - this chapter is a goldmine of advice from your manner of speaking to eliciting emotion;<br />7.  Setting Your Fee, Billing, and Collecting - speaks for itself; near and dear to every expert;<br />8.  Videotape Depositions - an important chapter inasmuch as videotape depositions are becoming more prevalent in today's courtrooms; and<br />9.  Handling Abuse - yes, the expert does have rights and recourse if an attorney is out-of-line.<br />I have been providing litigation consulting services for the last five years, have testified and/or been deposed in state court and NASD/NYSE arbitration hearings and can honestly tell you that this book should be considered a guidebook for any expert, whether new or experienced. I can't say enough good things about this book.	2003-03-16
US	52631726	R19P9G5CU34AJ4	0385508042	106527389	The King of Torts	Books	4	28	32	N	N	Closer to Grisham.	Like several reviewers, I have been less than enthralled with Grisham's latest legal thrillers. His last thriller, THE SUMMONS, in my opinion, was a yawner. However, after a brief sojourn into classic fiction with A PAINTED HOUSE and SKIPPING CHRISTMAS (which I highly recommend), Grisham has clawed his way back into the arena that made him the King of Legal Thrillers. THE KING OF TORTS is classic Grisham, in the form of A TIME TO KILL, THE FIRM, and my all-time favorite, THE PELICAN BRIEF. While KING OF TORTS still doesn't quite measure up, it is incredibly good.<br />What makes THE KING OF TORTS so good is the conceptual elements fans have grown to love about Grisham's thirllers: an underdog young attorney, a mysterious and clandestine protagonist, greasy \\"ambulance-chasing\\" attorneys and unscrupulous corporations. In the end, as always, it's all about the dollar. <br />Our \\"hero\\" in this thriller is J. Clay Carter II, a low-paid public defender in Washington, D.C. Clay has a well-to-do fiancée, Rebecca Van Horn who, along with her pugnacious mother and father continually nettle Clay to take a more lucrative job. His future in-laws are everything Clay despises. When he wontonly rejects Mr. Van Horn's offer of a corporate position making more than twice his PD pay, Rebecca dumps him for an geeky Ivy Leaguer. <br />Concurrent with his personal life heading south, Clay has just been ambushed into handling the defense of Tequila Watson, a young black man who shot a friend named \\"Pumpkin\\" (lively names). Although totally unmoved, Clay is intrigued as to why Tequila can't remember killing Pumpkin. It's as though his mind has been washed away...with drugs, Clay suspects. After issuing subpoenas for all the medical files from the street-tough drug rehabilitation center where Tequila was being treated, Clay gets the call of his young life. As Grisham describes him, \\"the man in black.\\" Clay meets the man in black, Max Pace, an ex-lawyer cum \\"fireman,\\" hired to solve problems on behalf of a variety of unnamed companies. His current \\"project\\" is on behalf of a major pharmaceutical company, which has just pulled the plug on a bad drug...a drug that has the side effects of making ex-addicts kill for no apparent reason. Pace's job for Clay? Offer the victims' families large settlements NOT to pursue any potential investigation or legal action. For this, Clay will receive a cool $15 million. Clay takes an extremely short moment and decides that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Why, he would be foolish to turn it down, wouldn't he? <br />Sure to his word, Max makes Clay a millionaire with a few short weeks of work. And, to add pleasure to ecstasy, Max has another, much larger \\"deal\\" for Clay. This deal involves another bad drug but this time, Clay gets to play the mass tort game. This, all from \\"tips\\" provided by the mysterious Max Pace. As Clay's new lawsuit takes form, he lands thousands of class-action suits and is dubbed by the major media \\"The King of Torts.\\" As the pitiful pharmaceutical company decides to settle with Clay and his newly minted legal bretheren, Clay is two-for-two, only this time, his take isn't $15 million; it's $100 million! Like taking candy from a baby. Clay believes he's this good and here comes the element creating problems for most, greed.<br />As Clay acquires a yacht (for his father), a private plane, an island retreat and a trophy girlfriend, he burns through his new found wealth at an astonishing pace both for pleasure and in funding his next legal bonanza. But, like Mitch McDeere, Grisham's protagonist in THE FIRM, Clay soon learns that his newly acquired riches come with a price he can't afford to pay.<br />Grisham's glimpse into the world of mass tort attorneys is poignant and timely. How many commercials do we see on television from those soliciting our aches, pains, and more frighteningly, our health. The multi-million dollar advertising campaigns they use to attract clients and the huge sums they extract from big corporations are astonishing albeit fetid.<br />Unlike many of the Hollywood stories, not all mass tort actions have \\"happy\\" endings. In some cases, attornys undeservingly obtain riches simply because the defendant corporation believes it can spend less to settle than to litigate. At some surreal level, this crack in our legal system is one that is uncomfortable at best; horrifying at worst. In many cases, good, well-intentioned companies are forced into bankruptcy and the victims, who suffered the most, are left with little after attorney's fees.<br />Grisham sets a good pace for this storyline and develops the characters quite well. The only problem I saw with THE KING OF TORTS is, having set up strong characters and revealed the conspiracy, Grisham spins the story to a condensed close. While this glimpse of the Grisham of old is encouraging, the sprial down to climax was a return to the recent past. This doesn't spoil the book, as a whole, but it does bring the awestruck level down to solid.<br />A good book, a fun read. I hope this is only peek into Grisham's future direction. Maybe, just maybe, we'll see another PELICAN BRIEF in the making.	2003-02-25

As one who practices in the business turnaround arena, I have a keen understanding of the Pate/Platt analogy of the Phoenix. In many cases, with the right timing, latitude, people and luck, a business heading south can be captured and &quot;redefined&quot; into one going the right direction. <br />For those unaware of the symmetry, the Phoenix takes is roots from classical mythology. The Phoenix, a young and strong firebird, would build a nest of frankincense and cassia twigs, ignite it, and self immolate once it became &quot;old.&quot; A new Phoenix would rise from these fragrant flames, gather the ashes of it's predecessor, encapsulate them in a precious egg of Myrrh, and fly them to the altar of the Egyptian God of the Sun in the city of Heliopolis Egypt where they were carefully deposited. According to many scholars, this flight represented &quot;the capacity to leave the world and its problems behind, flying towards the sun in clear pure skies.&quot; The ostensible lesson of the Phoenix is in the midst of prosperity and strength, we need a renewal phase or a recycling designed to interrupt the daily norms, allowing a rebirth and regeneration. <br />If there are two individuals with a strong sense of this &quot;rebirth,&quot; it's Carter Pate and Harlan Platt. Pate is a Big Four turnaround specialist and Platt created and administers the certification exam for the Turnaround Management Association. <br />In THE PHOENIX EFFECT, the authors reveal the warning signs and critical pointers leading to a &quot;real&quot; review of one's business without the emotional denial typically present. The ability to identify trouble spots before they create trouble is the key, the authors tell us. The nine strategies described by the authors are: <br />1) &quot;Determine the Scope&quot; - where does your business sit in the industry you compete? Should you create new business lines, drop old ones, merge, etc? <br />2) &quot;Orient the Business&quot; -  Are your products aimed at the right markets at the right time? Does your sales/growth strategy require some level of reorientation to generate greater effectiveness?<br />3) &quot;Manage Scale Accurately&quot; - can you grow your business from within with existing resources or should you consider a merger? <br />4) &quot;Handle Debt&quot; - restructure or renogotiate debt whenever possible. Create a credit facility meeting your business's need. {A word of caution: restructure credit facilities judiciously. Going back to the well too many times will create negativity, concern, doubt and potential retraction of your banking relationship.} <br />5) &quot;Get the Most from Assets&quot; - carefully scrutinize your asset bases, both tangible and intangible, to determine if they are working for your business. Any superfluous and underused assets should be considered dead weight.<br />6) &quot;Get the Most from Employees&quot; - identify and use creative strategies to increase the quality and productivity of your employee base. <br />7) &quot;Get the Most from Products&quot; - routinely review your product base to ascertain current pricing strategies, customer base and the quality a customer brings to your business. {I regularly review my client base to determine if I've outgrown a client. This type of renewal, while often awkward and painful, is absolutely healthy for both myself and the client.}<br />8) &quot;Produce the Product&quot; - are there alternative methods your products can be created, manufactured or offered proving more efficient and cost-effective? Is outsourcing a possibility? <br />9) &quot;Change the Process&quot; - model your own processes after those who have created a successful model. No change for the better is too small.<br />Pate and Platt provide an incredible number of real-life examples (certain aspects of which surprised me greatly...from a confidentiality point-of-view) of fatal mistakes and storied comebacks. This is a very solid read for any business owner, high-level manager, or consultant. It provides a blueprint for clarity in an otherwise complex web of uncertainty. Let's face it, any time a business is in trouble, you'll find more chaos, worry and &quot;Chicken Littleisms&quot; than you'll ever want to see. Creating a cohesive plan of attack designed to bring the pieces back together is the turnaround specialists mantra.<br />The only reason I didn't give this offering five stars was the authors' penchant for concentrating on the product section. While certainly not unimportant, the concept of crafting a turnaround strategy is much more than product direction and quality. Regardless, this book is quite good and extremely poignant.	2003-02-23

Scott Turow's first novel, PRESUMED INNOCENT, was a blockbuster success and while his subsequent novels haven't met with the same critical success, they have been bestsellers. With REVERSIBLE ERRORS, Turow has reclaimed some of the storytelling brio found in PRESUMED INNOCENT. Unlike Grisham, Turow provides a reader with the inner workings of the law, an often bleak view of our ultimate system of judgement. Turow, who has actually practiced law from both sides of the advocate system, knows it intimately and writes about it with passion. With that, he has given the reader one of his best with REVERSIBLE ERRORS.<br />REVERSIBLE ERRORS begins with about 50 to 75 pages of elaborate Michener-esque scene-setting, a writing tactic that will eliminate a few readers before the story begins. However, once Turow lays the groundwork and character definitions, the plot is moving and exciting. (NOTE: I strongly urge readers to \\"muddle\\" through this background overview...you'll not be disappointed.)<br />The protagonist in REVERSIBLE ERRORS is attorney Arthur Raven. After working for several years as a deputy prosecuting attorney, he joined a prominent firm and has ascended to the partnership level concentrating his practice in corporate civil litigation. Turow describes Arthur as late-30's, divorced, inept with women, prematurely middle-aged, but devoted to the law with ardent passion. Arthur's idealism is severely tested when he is appointed the pro bono case of Rommy \\"Squirrel\\" Gandolph. Rommy, truly nothing more than a petty thief, was implicated and convicted a decade ago in a bloody triple murder, a murder to which he ostensibly confessed. Now Rommy is on death row awaiting imminent execution. Arthur's appointment comes as Rommy, with his last appeal gone, is repudiating his confession and insisting on his innocence. Since the appeal process only allows points of law to be the subject of review, Arthur's only hope is to find \\"reversible error\\" in Rommy's trial and conviction. Turow defines reversible error for the reader as \\"error sufficiently egregious as to render capital punishment unjust and excessive.\\"<br />Arthur knows the battle is virtually impossible until another prisoner, Erno Erdai, writes a letter to the judge who presided over Rommy's original trial. The judge, Gillian Sullivan, has just been released from a federal prison for women after being convicted of 'selling judgement.' After Arthur reluctantly agrees to interview Erdai (with the help of former Judge Sullivan), he realizes that, in fact, Rommy may be innocent. <br />The plot and climax of the book are solid and exciting. There is plenty of diverting suspense providing several tense and somewhat anxious moments. With REVERSIBLE ERRORS, Turow proves his understanding of the proper weave of legal jargon and tactics into \\"lay\\" jargon. With the exception of the opening descriptive \\"essay,\\" REVERSIBLE ERRORS is a thoroughly enjoyable read.	2003-01-12
US	52631726	R2T3B1VC2TA1XD	089296779X	671055061	Breakout	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Parker, the King of the Breakout.	As a fan of mystery/suspense/hardboiled noir, I am uncertain how I've missed Richard Stark (a/k/a Don Westlake). In an event, BREAKOUT was my first Stark novel and as any noir fan will attest, Stark does it quite well. While fans of noir will envision no-nonsense, pushing-the-line yet &quot;good&quot; heros, Stark throws us a curve. The twist? Our hero(?), Parker, is as bad as they come...truly an anti-hero. If one can't get one's mind around a bad guy being depicted in a &quot;good&quot; light, move on.<br />The reader is introduced to Parker's lastest escapade, a &quot;foolproof&quot; robbery gone bad. As a result, Parker is transported to a large, nondescript, &quot;inescapable&quot; Midwestern holding prison. Parker being Parker, his immediate task is to figure a way out of the colossus, which has never yielded an escape. Parker sets out to find a trustworthy crew within the confines of a prison of untrustworthies, no small task to be sure. <br />Stark lays out the plan of escape with enough detail, the reader will feel as those he is a part of this crew. With little fanfare, the crew is successful in their escape. In exchange for the participation of one of the crew in their daring escape, Parker has agreed to participate in the robbery of a local jewelry wholesaler. This, ostensibly, will provide each of the robbery crew with enough to disappear comfortably. The jewlery store is located in an old, restored armory creating a challenge of monumental proportions. A challenge Parker loathes; one providing him with an extremely uneasy feeling.<br />As Parker's trick knee predicted, disaster befalls the robbery crew. As the robbery disintegrates, the reader is introduced to Parker's psyche, a dark, lonely tomb with stoic albeit brilliant insights. The moniker that best suits Parker, in my mind at least, is that of a fireman. Always putting out fires, making the best of really bad situations. A man of few words to be sure but of extreme and calculated action. Parkeris a natural leader, not showy, but one others look to in time of crisis.<br />Needless to say, Parker and his are faced with another breakout, this from the armory (jewelry store) before daylight. As the crew dwindles due to unforeseen demise, Parker, Williams, and Mackey become quite tight as they successfully overcome various obstacles and tight fixes. Tight, in the sense that they rely on each other to make yet another escape. Beyond that, their are no ties between these men with no ties.<br />My take, as a first-time reader of Stark, is that he is masterful in his presentation and communication of this oft-presented but rarely understood life of a transient criminal. Although in many ways unsavory, Stark does an excellent job of turning Parker into a lovable anti-hero. So much so, that in the end, when the inevitable clutches of law enforcement begin to close in, I found myself &quot;willing&quot; Parker's yet third escape (breakout). A thrilling ending to a strange yet colorful book. <br />I'll be making my way backward now through the other Parker novels, at least, those still available. BREAKOUT is an extremely quick, fun and strange read. Off-the-beaten path, as it were but one, who is a fan of noir, should not miss.	2002-12-16
US	52631726	R33CMRFMC9R2ZF	0609608002	289510155	Start with NO...The Negotiating Tools that the Pros Don't Want You to Know	Books	4	93	97	N	N	Conventional Wisdom be damned! Bring the Contrarian.	Jim Camp is new to me but will most likely become quite a bright albeit controversial figure in management circles. Mr. Camp's new offering, START WITH NO, specifically debunks the methodology we were all taught in Negotiation 101...achieve &quot;win-win&quot; at all costs. Mr. Camp says NO, with a capital N, to this weak, antiquated negotiating objective.<br />Mr. Camp introduces his theory, &quot;...I believe win-win is hopelessly misguided as a basis for good negotiating, in business or in your personal life or anywhere else.&quot; So begins his treatise encapsulated in contrarian thinking toward negotiations of any type. Win-win, posits Mr. Camp, is an invitation to lose. While conventional tutelage is grounded in give-and-take compromise, Mr. Camp's negotiating foundation begins with giving or taking a No. Empowering an opponent to say No is power, according to Camp. <br />Mr. Camp quotes the ever-popular negotiating gem, GETTING TO YES, and its basic definition of a &quot;wise agreement.&quot; A wise agreement meets the legitimate interests of each side to the extent possible, resolves conflicting interests fairly, is durable, and takes community interests into account. Camp's theory is that compromise is implicit within this definition, perhaps explicit. His question: Why in the world compromise before you're certain you have to?<br />Mr. Camp offers the reader an indepth view of why saying No is beneficial to a negotiator amongst an abundance of wisdom, tactics and observations from years of negotiation coaching. In the end, Mr. Camp leaves us with &quot;The Thirty-three Rules&quot; of negotiating. A few of these, which fly in the face of the conventional win-win theory:<br /> - Your job is not to be liked. Its to be respected and effective.<BR> - Never enter a negotiation-never make a phone call-without a valid agenda.<BR> - You do not need it. You only want it. {a very key attribute regardless the theoretical camp in which one resides}<BR> - The value of the negotiation increase by multiples as time, energy, money, and emotion are spent.<BR> - &quot;No&quot; is good, &quot;yes&quot; is bad, &quot;maybe&quot; is worse.<BR> - &quot;Our greatest strength is our greatest weakness (Emerson).<br />All this said, Mr. Camp has presented an extremely cogent view of why win-win is outdated and outmoded. However, there are always situations wherein weakness is the position in which one begins providing a gauntlet of hurdles to clear before reaching the proprietary level of success. Consequently, it is my conclusion that, while Mr. Camp's methods are unorthodox and unconventional, they can be of great assistance to a negotiator who understands that each negotiation has its own set of facts and circumstances. No single negotiation exists in a vacuum. <br />Commingled utilization of Mr. Camp's methodology along with emotion-neutral theories should prove valuable to the negotiating professional. A good solid read that should be part of any negotiators' library.	2002-11-14
US	52631726	R1BUXK99019VRA	0312278543	941096752	Hard Freeze: A Joe Kurtz Novel (Joe Kurtz Thriller)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Harder than hardboiled? Yep, in spades!	...HARD FREEZE finds our hero(?) Joe Kurtz, picking up where he left off in HARD CASE...In true sequel style, HARD FREEZE picks up with Kurtz risking all to find and destroy anyone associated with the murder of Sam. <br />HARD FREEZE opens in the middle of a brutal Buffalo winter with Kurtz evading three hit men of questionable grey matter (Kurtz knew them in Attica as \\"The Three Stooges\\"). As it turns out, Steve \\"Little Skag\\" Farino, a returning character from HARD CASE, has decided that Kurtz must go but is too cheap to hire a quality hitter. Thus, The Three Stooges. After learning, through dubious means, of the latest plot against his life, Kurtz finds himself in a relatively no-win situation: cops on one side just waiting to send him back to the joint and the mob on the other side with renewed interest in seeing him become fish food. At this point, Simmons introduces the reader to Angelina Farino Ferrara, Little Skag's older sister and the initial protagonist. Through \\"certain\\" interrogation techniques, Kurtz learns that another Buffalo crime family, the Gozangas, was responsible for Samantha's murder. This is all Kurtz needs to know to become the one-man wrecking crew that he is however, the storyline doesn't stop here.<br />Simmons decides to make Kurtz's life a little more [interesting] by throwing two more, somewhat exacerbating, circumstances at our hero. Kurtz's teenage daughter, a daughter who has no clue of Joe Kurtz's existence, has been left in the custodianship of the sterotypical sleazy stepfather. Without causing upheaval in his daughter's life, Kurtz decides to play her invisible angel by keeping tabs on the stepfather...quite close tabs.<br />The second situation and one that plays a major role in the plot of this book is a new client Kurtz is reluctant to take on. An older black man, John Wellington Frears, a concert violinist, was referred to Kurtz by his longtime heroin addict friend/informant, Pruno. It seems that Frears daughter was raped andmurdered some twenty years ago. The official story was that, after murdering Frears' daughter, the murderer commited the classic familial murder/suicide, but Frears swears to Kurtz that he saw the man at the Buffalo airport very recently. Although Kurtz is ostensibly unilaterally-minded in his quest for revenge against the Gonzaga Family, Kurtz takes on Frears' case and begins the hunt for the ghost Frears seeks. As the story plays out, it becomes abundantly clear that Frears' nemesis is also Kurtz's nemesis and a monster of much greater proportions than Kurtz could ever imagine.<br />It is quite obvious that Simmons' plot is multidimensional. However, he is able to keep the plot in reasonably decent order and places emphasis on the multipile storylines in a well-sorted manner thus keeping the reader involved in each subplot. Additionally, Simmons pays the proper level of attention to each subplot thereby creating the perfectly-wound web providing the basis for bringing the the storylines together in the end.<br />Of minor concern and my only issue with HARD FREEZE, the ending seemed somewhat abrupt, almost as though Simmons \\"needed\\" to finish the book ASAP. While not materially denigrating to the story as a whole, it was somewhat obvious and a bit detracting from an otherwise wonderful hardnosed, hardboiled crime noir bonanza. <br />Well worth the purchase price and the read.	2002-10-25
US	52631726	RS7JNTOXZ45NF	0300095325	853706599	Benjamin Franklin	Books	4	51	53	N	N	Great expose on our most interesting Founding Father.	Being a Ben Franklin afficionado of sorts and one who enjoys a good biography, I became quite intrigued to learn that Edmund S. Morgan was weighing in with his largess and vaunted knowledge of Franklin. Mr. Morgan, at 86 years of age, still embodies the somewhat sterotypical historian yet has extinguished himself as a gifted biographer. A Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale (he retired from full-time teaching in '86), Mr. Morgan has written more than a dozen books covering various topics and spectrums. His books have been hailed as &quot;groundbreaking&quot; and have won award after award. In 2000, Mr. Morgan was awarded the National Humanities Medal and cited as &quot;one of America's most distinguished historians.&quot; If Mr. Morgan's imposing reputation isn't enough, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN has already become the source material for an online history course offered by AllLearn, the triumvirate consortium for continuing education established by Yale, Stanford and Oxford Universities. And, heaping more critical praise, this book has already been named a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club and an alternate selection of the History Book Club. <br />As Mr. Morgan has been fond of saying, &quot;History can be boring.&quot; Consequently, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN not only educates, but I found it entertaining as well, a claim many biographies would loved to be tagged with. Mr. Morgan extolls Franklin's intellectual gifts as well as his place in history. Thus, the reader learns a bit more about the man, Ben Franklin, than just his deeds.<br />Franklin was born in 1706 in Boston although he soon made his way to Philadelphia, where he began his assent into historic laurel. Franklin's public career was nothing less than extraordinary. An author, scientist, politician, diplomat and inventor, he was a member of the 2nd Continental Congress and was instrumental in the creation and writing of the Declaration of Independence. His achievements were innumerable, from founding one of the country's first volunteer fire companies to his infamous discovery of electricity, a discovery founded on the &quot;kite&quot; legend.<br />Although an incredible man, Morgan goes to great lengths to ensure that the reader understands Franklin's complicated relationship with England and, at times, poor politics. An ardent proponent of Mother England, his attachment to the country became extremely complex in the winter of his life and caused his stellar reputation to be somewhat tarnished. Hardline American statesmen reminded anyone who would listen that Franklin openly described himself as &quot;an Englishman living in America.&quot;<br />It is obvious that Mr. Morgan genuinely appreciates Franklin, his mind and accomplishments. &quot;Intellectual curiosity is one of the rarest gifts and ... he was just loaded with curiosity. He never took things for granted,&quot; Morgan says. &quot;He is the most modern of all the Founding Fathers, the oldest in years but the youngest in outlook. He takes you by surprise.&quot;<br />Mr. Morgan's research for this offering was somewhat unorthodox by today's standards. He indicates that he did not read a biography on Franklin, rather he became enthralled by the existence of Franklin's complete papers on CD-ROM. The Packard Humanities Institute created the CD, which, Morgan says, compelled him to write the book.<br />BENJAMIN FRANKLIN is a remarkably &quot;easy&quot; read and one that is quite enjoyable. If I had one gripe, it is Mr. Morgan's depiction of Franklin's personal psyche or, should I say, lack of depiction. In many cases, biographers inundate a reader with a litany of personal information, which, at times, saturates the biography with distracting ideosyncratic nuances. In BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, I believe there was too little description of Franklin's personal life and private persona. This doesn't denigrate the book as a whole, rather it leaves the reader with a &quot;hole&quot; in the inquisitive understanding of Franklin.  <br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in learning more about our Founding Fathers and an incredible man.	2002-10-13
US	52631726	R3LDE7S3I65NC5	0374173273	93392203	How to Be Alone: Essays	Books	3	45	63	N	N	The Cynical Perch	Jonathan Franzen is an incredibly gifted writer. More than that, he has perceptive skills that go beyond simple norms. His ability to view a situation and record the minutiae is somewhat astounding, which is one of the reasons he is seen as an emerging literary star. And, to be totally fair and honest, I'm a fan; I like Franzen's style and passion for his art. OK, that said, I'm not exactly sure what Franzen was thinking with HOW TO BE ALONE. Lets just say that one expects something a bit different from the man who penned THE CORRECTIONS. <br />HOW TO BE ALONE is ostensibly a cathartic work from Franzen. He has taken 14 essays, written and published over the last 8 years, and presented them to the reader as a collection of his....thoughts. Each essay is precise, cogent and eloquent. Each essay is presumably a subject passionate to Franzen. Herein, lies the rub. It becomes painfully obvious, quite quickly, that each, in some way, explain and extol the World According to Jonathan Franzen or, Franzen's Gospel Postulations. He reports in fine detail his trials and tribulations relative to his father's struggle with Alzheimer's, on the America's seeming disdain for the written word, on the obsession with privacy, the sex advice industry, and a trist through the smoking debate but, in the end, he always ends up talking about one thing....himself. <br />The \\"revelations\\" revealed to the reader through Franzen's eyes are, well, blaise. They are as we know them. There is nothing new here. Its almost like the autobiography you see in the book store...of a person you've never heard of. It makes one ponder, \\"Why am I reading this? Oh yeah, because Jonathan Franzen wrote it.\\" Again, these are very well written pieces but, that's about it. It almost seems as though Franzen appears as the guy who has come to the party a bit late. You know, been there, done that.<br />So, these essays appear to lack originality and vigor, this, from a man who gave us an arguable masterpiece (THE CORRECTIONS)? The resulting questions is obvious: Why would Jonathan Franzen publish these essays in a single book? Why not let them remain as standalone pieces which, when published, were most likely looked upon as something that makes you go \\"Hmmm?\\" One could posit that Franzen is thumbing his nose at his dissenters thus maintaining his \\"bad boy\\" image. (For those that don't know, this image was crafted from Franzen's self-described \\"personal struggle\\" with having Oprah's Book Club seal emblazoned on the cover of THE CORRECTIONS and his requisite appearance on her show. His reluctance swiftly earned him a retraction from Oprah and the disdain of her legion of fans.) A stroke of arrogance or genius? Perhaps a bit of both. <br />So, after reading these essays, I find myself struggling with the theoretical conventions of assessing these works because...he's very convincing and typically right. This still doesn't bring one to an eye-to-eye level with Franzen as the stratosphere is difficult to achieve for mere humans. OK, a bit facetious albeit hinting of truth. Franzen even infers that he has put his elitist ways and past behind him and has professed his acceptance of the resposibility of being a \\"real\\" writer. We'll see.<br />One can easily see then, why I would title my review, \\"The Cynical Perch.\\" This moniker applies to my view as well as that of Franzen. This almost becomes an intellectual game of chess--one that has no clear winner, just participants. Who can be more cynical? <br />Franzen's writing and thought patterns easily rate 5 stars but that's not the question posed to a reviewer. The question posed to the reviewer is: How do I rate this BOOK? The book is questionable rhetoric taken as a whole. Franzen almost seems to be engaging in a process he publicly professes to loathe, unwitting commercialism. Thus, the book rates a 3. Still and all, I can recommend this book if one is a fan of Franzen because it IS vintage Franzen.<br />Love him or hate him, he is good, which is exactly why this book should never have been published.	2002-10-05
US	52631726	R1V1YT1SSKIY2U	0312274971	198636210	Hardcase	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Hardcase? Now there's a supreme understatement....	After reading the reviews from many of Dan Simmons' ardent fans, I'm convinced that I stumbled in the right direction when HARDCASE became my first Simmons read. That's not to say that I won't peruse his offerings in the other genres however, it seems that HARDCASE is a really nice intro for an author new to me. <br />As a precursor to the book, Simmons' dedication reads: \\"This is for Richard Stark, who sometimes writes under the wussy pseudonym of Donald Westlake.\\" Well, that'll nab one's interest. Simmons takes a lash at Westlake (who conversely writes under the pseudonym of Stark) right off the bat. However, it is obvious that Simmons' statement is tongue-in-cheek. Regardless, the dedication defines the book's impending aura of \\"in your face\\" entertainment.<br />As the book opens, we meet Joe Kurtz, a hardboiled Mike Hammer-type private investigator. Kurtz is tracking the second of two men who killed his partner...well, not tracking, stalking is a better word. By the end of the intro chapter, Kurtz has all but mangled Eddie Falco when he decides the coup de gras is to throw Falco out of his sixth-story apartment window. Without much ado, Kurtz heads to Attica for an extended stay at the state-run luxury resort. <br />While in Attica, Kurtz meets Steven \\"Little Skag\\" Farino, the son of aging Buffalo, New York, mob boss Don Byron Farino. As a \\"reward\\" for protecting Little Skag's manly pride from unwanted jailhouse affection, Kurtz gets an audience with Don Farino upon his release from prison. Don Farino, now crippled from a would-be assassin's bullet, is still clinging to a denigrated level of authority and power he used to hold as the feared boss of one of New York's elite organized crime families. Kurtz makes a deal with the Don to locate the Family's missing accountant. Without too much detail, it is obvious that the accountant knows way too much to be \\"missing.\\" Don Farino's attorney, Leonard Miles, is introduced to the reader and immediately stakes his position as consigliere while ruffling Kurtz's feathers. Kurtz, in form to be consistent throughout, lashes back at Miles with dripping sacrcasm and challenging lines. It is apparent from this exchange with Don Farino, his consigliere, and all the bodyguards present that Joe Kurtz takes no issue with stating his current frame of mind regardless the potential consequences.<br />With the storyline framed, Simmons leads the reader down a path fully expected of a hardboiled PI like Kurtz. While Simmons takes the reader on a violent tour of the Buffalo underworld, the action and noir detail keeps the storyline fresh and taut. But, one of the chief assets of this Simmons' offering is his character development, and what characters they are. <br />As a short list there's Malcolm Kimbunte, a sadistic killer-for hire; Cutter, Kimbunte's psychopathic sidekick; Doo-Rag, a gangbanger and Kimbunte's lackey; the Alabama Beagle Boys, brothers from an Aryan Nation organization; Sophia Farino, Don Farino's sultry, hot daughter; Pruno, a homeless junkie informant who used to be a Princeton professor; the Dane, a faceless hitman with a ubiquitious reputation; and a dwarf named Manny Levine, hell-bent on avenging his brother's death at the hands of Kurtz. There are just a few of the snapshot characterizations within this relatively short thriller.  <br />This is hardboiled noir at its best. The only downside is a less than perfect ending. Simmons was somewhat cathartic in his need to exhaust the storyline, which, in my opinion, detracted from the climax found in the second to last chapter. This is the only reason this book is sitting with four, instead of five stars. <br />If you're looking for the hardboiled noir genre, you've found it here. Simmons' Kurtz makes Spillane's Hammer look wimpy. This was a fun, fast and action-packed read. Recommended to anyone enjoying hardboiled noir.	2002-10-02

When it comes to claims of &quot;one-stop stores&quot; and the &quot;ultimate&quot; this or that, I'm a cynic. Further, (prior to purchase) I found it ludicrous that one individual resource claimed it could provide guidance relating to a given business scenario. And, while BUSINESS: THE ULTIMATE RESOURCE (&quot;BTUR&quot;) is by no means the end all to a one-stop library for business knowledge, it comes about as close as anything I've seen in my career. Quite surprising, indeed.<br />To sum up this voluminous work, BTUR is the ultimate business encyclopedia. At a full eight pounds (and awkward as hell), it promulgates its place in a manager's bookshelf as a simplified answer to information and answers for the harried executive. And, in many areas, it achieves its lofty self-proclamations.<br />An example of some of the extremely helpful offerings:<br /> - Over 100 management checklists providing answers (and more importantly, thoughtful consideration) to daily operational-type issues;<BR> - Over 100 biographical thumbnails of leading business leaders, visionaries and pioneers;<BR> - Summaries of the 70 most influential business books of all time (this list is suspect but decent);<BR> - A dictionary of business nomenclature, words and phrases; and<BR> - Over 100 &quot;best-practice&quot; essays from mainstream treatises to obscure, isolated areas.<br />These &quot;lists&quot; are very helpful and poignant in that they are all found in one resource. This then, if for no other reason, is why BTUR is a resource worth owning. BTUR's objective is to provide &quot;basic business literacy.&quot;  Author Goleman writes in his introduction: &quot;Business advantage is gained by harnessing smart ideas....&quot; Never could a statement be more profound or true relative to business success. <br />While I found this book (can you call something that weighs 8 lbs., a book?) a qualified multi-purpose guide, the very purpose it intends to serve is its one downfall. That is, rather than avail itself as a useful 'filter' for the amplitude of business information in our world today, it manifests extreme data overload {at times}. In other words, there are a variety of offerings that are so obscure that most will just stare and say, &quot;Huh?&quot; Don't believe me? Take a look at the Table of Contents under &quot;Best Practices.&quot; Further, to truly make BTUR a indispensible resource, one will have to become very familiar with the Table of Contents and the Index. There is no way this guide will be of any help otherwise inasmuch as this pup comes in at just over 2,200 pages.<br />In summary then, its easy to look at a resource guide of this magnitude and scoff. However, before you do, you should take a serious look at the content...not just the Table of Contents. This book has true value. As one who coaches and consults with businesses relative to profit performance and operational efficiencies, I found BTUR to be a very reasonable and competent supplement. Further, I found certain ideas very palatable for potential use with my clients (something about old dogs and new tricks comes to mind). Its definitely no end-all but its worth the price.	2002-09-27

Being in the professional negotiation game, I thoroughly enjoy reading books which describe and tutor the subject. Although the current market is lousy with negotiating treatises, there are a few that stand out. Fisher and Ury's GETTING TO YES seems to be my favorite, one I return to time and again. However, I believe it healthly to step outside conventional wisdom and somewhat static norms to expand one's knowledge base. Although I had no idea of the content, quality or readability of GUERRILLA NEGOTIATING, I took a flyer on it as it \\"looked\\" like it might be of some interest.<br />Authors Levinson, Smith and Wilson have been working together for some time now promoting the \\"Guerrilla\\" books, seminars, tapes, etc. and have been quite successful, commercially. Although this is my first \\"Guerilla\\" book, I know of their successes and common acceptance within many business circles. However, I don't judge a book or theory based on the opinions of others so, of course, I had to buy this book to determine if it had the content described in the hype.<br />The easy answer is that yes, indeed, this book contains the basics of negotiation theory and time-tested schemes and strategies. The problem I had with GUERRILLA NEGOTIATING was its complete lack of fluidity and cogence. Its almost as though the authors \\"bulleted\\" the book and a ghost writer took their words verbatim without the benefit of explanatory offsets. This book does very little to describe complex situations with offered solutions and options. Remember, when reading a non-fiction book AND if one is a serious reader of non-fiction, the reader will be looking for that ONE gem within the book to add to his/her repretoire. This book is basic in nature and lacked the ability to truly explain the negotiating process. Without an explanation of the framework and processes, a new negotiatior will be totally lost. And, if one is attempting to put to work the Guerrilla tactics, they will most likely present their case in astaggered, illogical, and perhaps, unprofessional manner as the authors failed to bring together the process of \\"beginning-to-end.\\" This is my main gripe about the book.<br />To say that the book is not \\"Guerrilla\\" in nature would be a dramatic misstatement. The authors present a variety of tactics to move negotiations along including, well, a water gun. Yep, a water gun. The authors posit that if negotiations are bogged down or if you are having a difficult time moving a decisionmaker, bring a water gun to the table and threaten (or begin) to shoot him. Now, in a sales setting and depending on the sophistication of the other party, this \\"might\\" work. In a professional setting, this is tantamount to death. Lack of common sense given the facts and circumstances of a particular situation can be the death knell of a pending transaction.<br />Nevertheless, I cannot say this is a bad book. The book presents the materials necessary for the new negotiatior and, even some level of information for the seasoned negotiator. It is interesting that once a negotiator establishes a style, he/she just looks for ways to enhance that style. This book could fill that role. <br />Bottom line....if you're new to negotiating, this book will provide \\"glimpse-level\\" insight into the process. Don't look for the proverbial outline, its not there. The book doesn't present the reader with a process toward successful negotiations or even negotiation theory for that matter. On the other hand, the book does present the reader with a trove of summarized negotiating nuggets that will most likely be beneficial to many initiates. Further, the book provides summary resource materials. <br />CONTENT = great; READABILITY = poor.	2002-09-26
US	52631726	R13VNJSUGYBVZ1	0312955006	396820452	The Concrete Blonde (Harry Bosch)	Books	5	24	26	N	N	Scorching Mystery! Connelly definitely has the recipe......	First, before I begin reviewing THE CONCRETE BLOND, how easy is it to buy a book when upon opening it for a cursory scan, you see the main character's name is Hieronymous? It was a must read as I ... nearly laughed out loud! Seriously, this was the first Michael Connelly offering I've read and I was thrilled to find the brashness of Spillane and the heady detail of Grisham. Don't misunderstand, I believe the quality of Connelly's writing to be much more elegant than Spillane's and perhaps more exciting than Grisham's (certainly his latest works) but there are some attributes of those authors seeping into Mr. Connelly's grey matter. Regardless, Mr. Connelly's writing is not one dimensional.<br />The reader is introduced to Hieronymous ... \\"Harry\\" Bosch, a tough, hardened LA detective loathing authority with a seemingly unpenetrable psyche. (Note: My reference to Spillane above was in comparison of his Mike Hammer character to Bosch; definitely some similarities.) As the story opens, the reader is thrown back four years as Harry bursts into an isolated apartment to ostensibly arrest a notorious serial killer known as the 'Dollmaker.' As Harry enters, he is confronted with a naked man, totally devoid of hair. Harry orders him to \\"freeze\\" when the man reaches for something under his pillow. Harry fires and the man crumples on the bed, dead. As Harry looks under the pillow for the gun, he discovers that the man's weapon of choice wasn't a gun rather, it was a toupee. Harry's tail is eventually bailed out after he and the forensics team discover enough evidence to tie the hairless man to the 'Dollmaker' murders.<br />Fast forward four years.....Harry is heading to court as his 'Dollmaker' killing has provided the fodder for a lawsuit by the \\"victim's\\" family. The charge? Excessive force. To make matters worse, the family has hired Honey \\"Money\\" Chandler, a trial-hardened civil rights attorney known for her ability to procure 'money' from whomever she sues. Bosch seems tobe perfect prey for her.<br />As the trial opens, Bosch is called by his current lieutenant to a crime scene. A tip, in the form of an anonymous note, was left in the squad room by an unknown person. The note indicated that the 'Dollmaker' had not been caught and to punctuate the point, the note provides directions to a body proving his claim. As Harry arrives, a demolition crew is removing slabs of concrete from a dilapidated building destroyed in the LA riots. Soon and much to Harry's dismay, a body is discovered (a blond woman buried in concrete, in case you were wondering) who ultimately died under the same \\"M.O.\\" as that used by the 'Dollmaker.' Harry is freaked. Had he killed the wrong man? Was the nefarious 'Dollmaker' still on the streets? Or is this a copycat trying to pull his chain? Regardless the answer, Harry decides he will find out, trial or no trial.<br />The ride Connelly takes the reader on is fabulous. Mind-bending, severe twists. Just when I thought I had it nailed, Connelly would throw another curve. There are so many possible suspects here AND, the reader must determine if, in fact, there is a copycat and who or if the real 'Dollmaker' remains. This is a mystery easily worth 5 stars. I don't often give 5 stars but I was happy to do so here. As proof, I've purchased 4 other Connelly offerings to further my enjoyment, THE LAST COYOTE, TRUNK MUSIC, ANGEL'S FLIGHT, and CITY OF BONES. I look forward to getting to know Hieronymous Bosch much better.	2002-09-08
US	52631726	R1MO9WX4TUAFCU	0812932870	729671039	The Other 90%: How to Unlock Your Vast Untapped Potential for Leadership and Life	Books	4	9	12	N	N	The Elusive Search for Id.	I must admit, the title of this book is what originally snared me. For many years, I have been wonderously curious about the theory (or is it urban legend?) that the average human only utilizes 10% of the brain's intellectual capacity. Well, OK, how does one access &quot;other 90%?&quot; So you see, the title of Robert Cooper's book, THE OTHER 90%, spoke to me immediately. <br />Dr. Cooper has been described as &quot;An acclaimed educator on how exceptional leaders and teams liberate untapped human capacities and excel under pressure, Cooper is also recognized for his pioneering work on the practical application of emotional intelligence and the neuroscience of trust, ingenuity and leadership.&quot; Seems as though Dr. Cooper has found the other 90%? Maybe, maybe not.<br />THE OTHER 90% typifies many other books in the self-help genre in that Dr. Cooper has not really broken any new ground within. There is no &quot;Eureka!&quot; There is no &quot;90%&quot; Holy Grail. Having said all that, reading Dr. Cooper's book and given the other resouces I have located in the past, there leaves little doubt as to the existence of the mythical and elusive &quot;other 90%.&quot; Consequently, attempting to provide a practical guide to arousing the sleeping giant within (a little Anthony Robbins seeping through!), Dr. Cooper throws the reader toward a search for oneself albeit one's inner self. This, like the teachings of Robbins, Brian Tracy and many others, is tantamount to locating and discovering the vast potential within each of us. The methodologies and theories between all of these self-help gurus are comparable in nature when looking &quot;outside-in.&quot; They get there in differing ways but all-in-all, these pioneers preach from the same rock. Of course there will always be varying opinions on how to attain this seemingly unreachable peak but the impetus behind Dr. Cooper's approach is one of practical application. This is something of a departure from the previous guides to getting in touch with the intangible Id. Dr. Cooper has approached this great conundrum in a different manner; anecodotal and creative challenges from his grandfathers elicited Cooper's search for his hidden greatness, ultimately his other 90%. <br />Dr. Cooper's theorum in reaching the other 90% is built around Four Keystones: 1) Trust, 2)Energy, 3) Farsightedness, and 4) Nerve.<br />Trust is centered around building and maintaining exceptional relationships. This keystone provides one with a support system designed to maintain high levels of thought, energy and emotional stability, all essential foundational attributes. He further instills that one should not react based on one &quot;internal source;&quot; rather one should trust and utilize one's heart and gut as well as one's mind to react and respond to issues. This provides a synergy of sorts within each of us creating more focused direction. <br />The energy keystone is pointed toward &quot;increasing your calm effectiveness under pressure.&quot; Ah, the proverbial nhirvana! Again, practical exercises and pauses to ensure that our minds, hearts, and guts are working in concert to promote the most congruous solution to the immediate fire. You've heard it before: count to ten, deep breaths, meditate, take a walk, etc. Do what it takes to create, maintain and manifest at a moment's notice, the calm spirit within. All wonderful suggestions and wholly practical albeit unoriginal. <br />Farsightedness is the keystone I believe to be the most important. Einstein posited, &quot;Imagination is more important than knowledge.&quot; Well, if this is true (and Einstein is the posterboy for tapping into the other 90%), then farsightedness, or having to ability (imagination) to dream of great things, is what we should all strive for. The crux of the farsightedness keystone: Strive for the big prize lest you acheive only the small prize. Here is the source of most of the missed potential in our lives. To spew an overused idiom, &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; to create often irrational and untapped possibilities and options is the key to discovering new ground within. Summarily then, imagination is more important than knowledge. <br />The fourth and final keystone: nerve. Lets face it, this emotional attribute holds many great individuals at bay. Nerve, or the ability to muster courage at a moment's notice is one of the great barriers to greatness.  Do you have dreams, ambitions, desires that you've failed to act upon? Why? Cooper postulates that nerve is one of the major contributing factors lacking in most. To that end, Cooper urges the reader to nurture habits of pushing the envelope or taking the extra step not taken to begin the process of creating the &quot;nerve&quot; necessary to overcome internal barriers. Here, Cooper provides great advice. <br />So, the upshot is that once you've finished reading THE OTHER 90%,  you'll not be thinking like Einstein but you may have a better idea of the tools needed to tap into your &quot;untapped potential.&quot; Don't look for miracle cures or the &quot;one&quot; hidden secret; its not here. However, reading this book will create an awareness for moving forward, perhaps breaking new ground. Frankly, if you read nothing else, read the section on Farsightedness; this is worth the price of the book.	2002-09-05
US	52631726	RY7Y9LKWQXUVH	0385336187	700164567	Warning Signs	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Mesmerizing fiction with factual overtones.........	As the story opens, Boulder's District Attorney, Royal Peterson, is brutally murdered in his home. While the police begin to search for Peterson's killer, Dr. Alan Gregory receives a frantic plea from a new patient, Naomi Bigg. Naomi seeks out Gregory when she suspects her high school son, Paul, is planning to avenge the seemingly incongruous treatment his father received for killing his sister's rapist. Naomi tells Gregory of Paul's best friend, Ramp, a somewhat shy, introverted yet dark teenager. While Naomi is vague and somewhat aberrant in her descriptions of Paul and Ramp, her insistent analogies to Columbine and the two teenage killers begin to send shivers up Gregory's spine. The relationship takes an incredible twist when he discerns a potential connection between Paul and Ramp to the murder of Royal Peterson. When Naomi hints of inferred retribution against Peterson and everyone involved in the botched prosecution of Paul's sister's rapist, Gregory immediately fears for his wife's life, as she was a part of the prosecutorial team. <br />As the investigation unfolds, the prime suspect in Peterson's murder is, strangely enough, Boulder police detective Lucy Tanner, the partner of Gregory's good friend, Sam Purdy. As the story ensues, bombs begin detonating confirming that Ramp and Paul(?) have begun their plan of revenge. As a consequence of the situation, Gregory faces an ethical dilemma whether to go to the police with the information he is receiving from Naomi or to keep it to himself to ensure that Naomi will continue to open up, potentially providing him with the information to protect his wife if she is a target. When a bomb goes off at Gregory's office killing Naomi and seriously injuring Gregory and Naomi's daughter, Gregory and Sam team up in an effort to prevent any further mayhem. The resulting chase for these teenage bombers and the exciting climax provide the reader with a tantalizing ending.<br />Several interesting questions arise within this story, which are extremely timely and poignant. Could the Columbine tragedy have been prevented if the killers' parents had investigated the activities of their own children and subsequently gone to the police? How many warning signs, signs of danger, are needed before a parent should react? While these questions may never be answered, they are foremost in the minds of most Americans and a focal point in WARNING SIGNS. <br />My first exposure to Stephen White was my read of THE PROGRAM, a gripping thriller also set in Boulder, CO. White, a clinical psychologist is the author of nine previous suspense novels. As is White's trademark, WARNING SIGNS emanates terror and launches sudden twists keeping the reader enmeshed in the story. While I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend this book, be prepared to pay close attention to the storyline. The Columbine overtones can be disturbing but are well placed and gracefully woven into the plot.	2002-08-12
US	52631726	R2CMWDTQENE4SF	0743214277	479818734	Why Is It Always About You?: The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism	Books	4	649	696	N	N	Dealing with the egotists in your life.	Think you don't know a narcissist? Think again. Narcissists are everywhere particularly, in the public eye. Think about the Enron and Worldcom disasters. Do you think Skilling and Fastow or Ebbers and Sullivan aren't as narcissistic as they come? They fit the mold in spades. And how about our cultural obsession with these egotists? Aren't we somewhat awestruck by the \\"My ... doesn't stink\\" stars? From time-to-time, we're all a bit 'wowed.' I'm certainly guilty but perhaps now I'll have a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding the situations and 'icons' involved. WHY IS IT ALWAYS ABOUT YOU is an extremely insightful expose' on the egotists in your world, whether mildly or flagrantly narcissistic. And, this 'disease' doesn't just apply to our public figures; it can be as close as your immediate family or, heaven forbid, yourself!<br />Narcissism derives its origin from a youth in classical Greek Mythology, Narcissus. The story goes that one day Narcissus saw his reflection in a pool of water and immediately fell in love with his image. From that very moment, he began to see everything as it related to his own image. The world was his looking glass and his insatiable appetite for himself took him all over the globe, and he was invariably pleased with what he saw. He left in his path a troubling wake which slipped like a fever through the people who saw him. <br />Ms. Hotchkiss has nailed this subject when she posits \\"Their needs are more important than anyone else's, and they expect to be accommodated in all things. They can't comprehend why they might not always come first.\\" Narcissists are endearing, enticing creatures typically with extremely thick skins....but only to certain elements. Think about the guy or gal at the cocktail party who brazenly bullies his or her opinion on any and all subjects without any plausible evidence to back them up. Some find these people oppressive, some finding them fascinating. (As for me, I've just come to grips with the unmistakable fact that the breakup of a previous business partnership was due primarily to a case of narcissism. A childhood friend of mine who eventually became my partner was image-laden. Eventually, all things relative to our business became 'how did it benefit him?' Without knowledge of what I was experiencing, I became disenchanted and extremely angry. Perhaps if I'd had Ms. Hotchkiss's book at hand, I might have been able to craft an alternative path and save the partnership. Regardless, I have no regrets at this point.)<br />Ms. Hotchkiss doesn't necessarily offer any new information about the origins of narcissism but she does a fascinating job of portraying the disorder and the types of behaviors associated with this 'malady.' According to Ms. Hotchkiss, narcissists morph their personalities to suppress their internal negativity and by so doing, lose all perspective of reality. This plus the constant need for adoration and affirmation requires the personality morphing to achieve the adulation they seek. <br />Ms. Hotchkiss breaks the narcissist down for the reader outlining the attributes one should understand. She entitles these attributes, \\"The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism\\" as follows: Shamelessness, Magical Thinking, Arrogance, Envy, Entitlement, Exploitation and Bad Boundaries. Ms. Hotchkiss illustrates these qualities with profiles of the narcissists she's encountered throughout the book. The irrefutable moral of each story is that these people are missing out on what's really important. They are so busy loving themselves that they've forgotten to love anyone else.<br />While most readers will buy and read this book in order to deal with those afflicted in their own families, my primary purpose for reading this book was to get a better grasp on the affliction for those I deal with professionally. It is amazing how quickly one can identify potential problem clients or mitigate probable issues just by understanding that the person one is dealing with is narcissistic. Whether saddled with a narcissist personally, professionally or both (most of us will have both), WHY IS IT ALWAYS ABOUT YOU has something to offer for everyone.	2002-08-04
US	52631726	R3SR3MPFWX73ZF	0399148817	524201117	Sleep No More	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Paranormal conundrum? Who cares! Simply smashing!	After reading many of the professional critic's reviews, it seems apparent that many of these `professionals' look for logic, veracity and reality in fiction. True, most thrillers and mysteries must possess some quality of believability but beyond that, the author has unabated license to create. For many, the thought of transmigration, or soul transfer, is beyond the boundaries of possibility. Quite frankly, I don't find it plausible or tangibly logical but then, I'm not reading the latest Greg Iles thriller with an eye toward logic. I'm reading Iles because he is quickly mastering the art of `transmigrating' this reader into the storyline with each and every offering, paranormal conundrum or not.<br />SLEEP NO MORE is Greg Iles latest thriller and it was just that, a thrill. John Waters is a successful geologist living in Natchez, Mississippi with his wife Lily and daughter Annelise. Waters' business partner is long-time friend, Cole Smith, an obsessive personality and extremely self-destructive. The intimacy in Waters' marriage has waned over the years specifically centered around two miscarriages endured by Lily. Waters is a faithful and loving husband and something of a model father. However, as fate would have it, Iles puts these qualities to task. <br />During his collegiate years, Waters had a stormy love affair with a beautiful albeit bewitching woman, Mallory Candler. This affair tested the boundaries of human frailty, physically and emotionally. In the end, Waters ended the relationship and Mallory disappeared only later to be killed in New Orleans. Waters felt Mallory's untimely death brought an end to a particularly dark chapter in his life.<br />One day, after coaching his daughter's soccer team to victory, Waters is leaving the field when he casually passes a beautiful woman, a woman that immediately reminds him of Mallory Candler. As he turns to look over his shoulder, she is looking directly at him and mouths the word, \\"Soon.\\" This sends earthshakingchills through Waters, as this was the exact word he and Mallory would use to express their physical desires in public during those college years. He later finds out that this woman is Eve Sumner, a local real estate broker. As the storyline develops, Eve tempts Waters' honor and the plot immediately becomes whirlwind and tantalizing. <br />As an aside, if one is an Iles fan from way back, familiar characters reappear from Iles bestseller, THE QUIET GAME, another incredible read. Penn Cage, the lovable attorney-cum-author returns for an encore in SLEEP NO MORE. From a practical point-of-view, this could be a marketing stroke of genius. If a reader is enjoying Iles for the first time in SLEEP NO MORE, the reader might just take a flyer on THE QUIET GAME given its `presence' in SLEEP. It will be interesting to see if there is resurging demand for THE QUIET GAME.<br />The theory of transmigration, while not new, is one of fiction or, at the very least, an unexplained, unproven phenomenon. Could one person's soul find its way into another and actually `take over' the physical body? Readers will have to solve that puzzle on their own. However, remember that what you are reading is a work of fiction, not a biography or professional text. SLEEP NO MORE is designed to entertain and titillate albeit intellectually; Iles has always written in a somewhat cerebral fashion. <br />Bottom line....if you're looking for a breathtaking, `edge of your seat' read, SLEEP NO MORE is it. An incredible work that will leave the reader on the edge of \\"Huh?\\" and \\"Is it possible?\\" throughout. If a great thriller, by definition, is chilling and heart pounding, then SLEEP NO MORE is a great thriller.	2002-07-28

I guess, from a pure business point-of-view, commercialism IS the name of the game but that can really leave the reader in an undefined abyss at times. To better define where I'm heading, I fully believe the new impetus relative to second author \\"contributors\\" is nothing more than a methodology to put books on the shelf. If Paul Kemprecos can write the meat of a novel and Mr. Cussler can edit the manuscript through cursory review, a publisher has the formula for \\"best efforts\\" relative to gross sales. Unfortunately, this formula does not always yield the \\"best\\" results for the reader.<br />FIRE ICE is the latest offering from Cussler and Kemprecos and, as is wonderfully expected, centers itself around the latest NUMA adventure. Like VALHALLA RISING (a book I enjoyed immensely), Cussler brings the reader to a different time and place at the beginning of the book, setting the tone for the main theme. The introduction of FIRE ICE begins in Russia in 1918 with the sinking of a rusty merchant ship, the Odessa Star. The reader is then 'transported' to current day, off the Maine coast, fishing with Dr. Leroy Jenkins. Dr. Jenkins, a retired oceanography college professor, feels a shift in the ocean waters suddenly reminding of him of a not so pleasant memory, in another time and place. True to professorial form, he notifies the sheriff of his hometown to evacuate the coastline. What does Dr. Jenkins suspect? A tsunami. Why and what causes it is the darkly-veiled mystery.<br />As the story unfolds, our resident villian comes to the reader in the form of Mikhail Razov. Razov, like the archetypal filthy rich megalomaniac, believes himself to be a direct descendent of the Romanovs. Like the czar, Razov's personal advisor is a mad monk aptly named Boris who, conveniently enough, is an indirect descendent of the infamous mad monk, Rasputin. Our villan has devised a scheme to instigate numerous tsunamis by tapping into the ocean's natural methane hydrates,or Fire Ice. The reason? To shift the planet's climate base and accelerate global warming in an effort to tap into the untold resources in Siberia. The rub? It would turn most of the United States into a vast wasteland. <br />Our hero for this Cussler iteration is Kurt Austin, a bit less outspoken than Dirk Pitt but nonetheless heroic and dashing. Austin and his Special Assignments team must determine the source of this diabolical plan and, with the assistance of his team and another very unlikely character, foil it lest the U.S. perish. Returning characters to the Austin genre include the lovable Joe Zavala, the Trouts, Adm. Sandecker, Rudi Gunn and Hyram Yeager (Max, as always, is 'with' Yeager!). <br />Like the latest collaboration by Robert Ludlum (The Paris Option), FIRE ICE just does not have the same edge expected from Clive Cussler, which leads to one of two conclusions: 1) Cussler is losing his touch or 2) Kemprecos is the writer. I lean toward 2) as I don't think Cussler is considering retirement nor do I believe he's finished enthralling us with NUMA tales nor can I fathom that he's losing his touch. <br />Like most of Cussler's books, FIRE ICE provides the reader with the requisite tutorial in an area of oceanic science and history unlike any other fiction offering. Frankly, from this standpoint alone, learning from a book of fiction what can be considered as extremely boring classroom discussions is something of an unexpected treat. However, this is not the reason a typical reader picks up the latest Cussler thriller.  <br />In the end, this is a decent book with some sharp edges but without the typical Cussler brio. Perhaps I'm expecting too much when I see Cussler's name on a \\"soon-to-be-released\\" list but still, isn't that one of the reasons we read?	2002-07-16

MYSTIC RIVER was recommended to me by a bookseller as a 'real life mystery.' An accurate description indeed.<br />Without having the benefit of perusing his other offerings, its difficult for me to know whether his story cadence and sentence structure is the same from book-to-book. Regardless, his style may take some readers by surprise. He has a tendency to utilize fragmented sentences in a noir style to accentuate a scene or description of a character. Slang and geographic innuendo is also used quite well in this book.<br />In MYSTIC RIVER, Lehane sets the stage for the main characters and allows the reader to 'grow up' with them into adulthood. This lays the foundation for the main theme and the ultimate backdrop of intense intrigue. Lehane does an outstanding job of keeping the clues close to the vest throughout the story so as not to give away the answer to our mystery. Further, he will lead the reader down a path of ostensible righteousness only to foil the answer with the next chapter. This methodology keeps the reader turning pages; something any good author should strive for.<br />The setting for the story is working-class Boston. To give proper affect to the geography, the aforementioned speech patterns can only be described as ethnic slang (Irish/Italian perhaps). The story begins by introducing three childhood friends, Sean Devine, Jimmy Marcus, and Dave Boyle. (Lehane describes the socioeconomic situations relative to each character in great detail, which plays a role in our mystery.) The three are \\"fighting\\" (as kids do) in the street when a strange car rolls up and two men, claiming to be cops, take Dave into \\"custody.\\" After the car drives off, Sean and Jimmy are totally freaked out and become worried about what might happen to Dave. Four days later, Dave reappears after having escaped from the \\"cops.\\" Well, as one might imagine, these weren't cops. Dave is now emotionally scarred and grows up with external and internal battles associated with his four-day absence.<br />Twenty-five years pass and Lehane presents Sean as a state homicide detective, Jimmy as an ex-con turned heart-of-gold businessman, and Dave as a transient worker but with a loving wife and son. The story takes on weight when Katie, Jimmy's oldest daughter, is found brutally murdered and Sean, who has been estranged from Jimmy for literally twenty years, is assigned the task of finding Katie's killer. This provides the impetus of drawing the three former friends back together.<br />Sean's investigation provides the fodder for conflict with Jimmy and ultimately, Dave. Jimmy, an ex-gangster in his own right, has his own idea of how justice should be doled out and Dave must explain to his wife (who happens to be the cousin of Jimmy's wife) why he came home the night of the murder covered in blood.<br />Lehane has an excellent knack for stretching the story just enough to make it a bit nerve-wracking. An outstanding quality to be sure for a mystery writer. The amazing conundrum for me was as I felt I was being stretched out in certain spots, the pages were flying by.<br />I won't go into the climax except to say that this is perhaps the only weak part of the book. Not weak from the standpoint of easy clues and obvious killer(s) but weak from a credibility point-of-view (i.e. is this really possible?). This fact is the only reason this book did not receive 5 stars. Definitely worth the read.one might imagine, these weren't cops.

US	52631726	R2Z3SXJD7BG6ZR	0312289871	970494196	Robert Ludlum's The Paris Option: A Covert-One Novel (Ludlum, Robert, Covert-One Novels.)	Books	3	36	39	N	N	Ludlum-like but not Ludlum	If one is fond of this genre, one will find an interesting trend beginning to develop. Several well-known authors are taking on co-authors (apprentices actually) in their latest offerings. Patterson with his latest, Cussler with his latest, Clancy for some time and now, Ludlum with his previous two and this one, THE PARIS OPTION. Of course, Mr. Ludlum passed away over a year ago (an incredible loss to the literary world) and anything with his name will be co-authored or a reissue. For those of us who are die-hard Ludlumites, any taste from the Master is welcome. However, these co-authored books are less than authentic and THE PARIS OPTION is no exception.<br />Robert Ludlum was the absolute ruler of intrigue. If you are reading this review and haven't read a \\"real\\" Ludlum, pick up The Parsifal Mosaic or The Matarese Circle or the Bourne series (unlike a previous reviewer, I felt the Bourne movie didn't do the book justice). These books will absolutely put you on your heels. Ludlum had a way of telekenetically transporting the reader into the story. You are there...with the characters....truly spellbinding! In the co-authored books, apparently Mr. Ludlum's only contributions are the short outlines and a mentoring review (this, per an interview with Gayle Lynds). In the combined efforts, Ms. Lynds (and Philip Shelby in THE CASSANDRA COMPACT) develops the storyline and characters, which is what most hard-line Ludlum fans miss the most from Mr. Ludlum himself. While Ms. Lynds does a reasonable job of creating a suspenseful plot, it falls short of Ludlumite expectations. I would even go as far to say that if this was a standalone offering from Ms. Lynds, it might receive a more favorable critical review if for no other reason than not having to live up to the Ludlum standard.<br />To the story.......Jon Smith, our resident M.D. and superspy of Covert-One, returns from THE HADES FACTOR to unravel the mystery of the missing DNA computer. The brilliant French scientist, Emile' Chambord, is clandestinely putting the finishing touches on the world's first DNA computer (a computer combining life and computational sciences thereby creating a \\"living\\" machine) in Paris' own Pasteur Institute when an incredible explosion shatters the Institute and ostensibly Dr. Chambord and his invention. When Smith discovers that his friend, Marty Zellerbach, was in the Institute working with Chambord and was seriously injured in the blast, he drops his current research and heads for Paris.<br />Once there, the mysterious explosion, the frightening potential of the DNA computer and the uncertainty of Chambord's death throw Smith into the middle of an international crisis. An unknown cabal calling itself the Scarlet Shield, a pan-Islamic organization, is apparently behind the terror. Ultimately, Smith is joined by his spook cohorts from HADES, Randi Russell of the CIA and Peter Howell, retired (sort of) with MI6. <br />The plot is timely and has the requisite sharp edges. The character definition is moderate (better if one has previously read HADES) and the climax is probably the best part of the book. All-in-all, a decent read but if you're looking for this book to have the delictable flavor of a Ludlum thriller, you're likely to be sorely disappointed.	2002-06-30
US	52631726	R2JIEHBNZDKYP1	0446516570	265598858	Up Country: A Novel	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Demille's witty catharsis.	Nelson Demille is one of my favorite authors. Not in the same manner as Clancy, Parker, Ludlum, and Silva strike me but more as an intellectual mystery. A challenge, if you will. My introduction to Demille was none other than GOLD COAST and from there, I was hooked.<br />One of the reasons Demille is incredibly successful is his uncanny ability to visually establish the venue for the reader and develop his characters to the point that you've made decisions about whether to like or despise them. After you read a Demille novel, you feel as though you know the main characters, personally. UP COUNTRY is no exception to this rule. Symbolically, if you desire depth (a/k/a Mitchner/Clancy-esque), this tome, at 702 pages, fits the bill in spades! <br />We're reintroduced to Paul Brenner, the military policeman from the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigation Division, who appeared in THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER, the wildly successful book and movie. We now find Brenner retired and struggling to find his way without his investigative passion. Additionally, he has way too much time on his hands and too much time apart from Cynthia Sunhill, his main squeeze and former CID partner. <br />The main plot is introduced as Brenner receives a somewhat cryptic email from his former Army boss, Karl Hellman, \\"ordering\\" him to a meeting at the Vietnam War Memorial in D.C. Hellman makes a strong and convincing case for Brenner to make his way back to Vietnam to determine the truth to a thirty year old murder. The Vietnam connection comes from a recently recovered letter from one Vietnamese soldier to another, kept as a battle souvenir by the American who killed its recipient. The letter seems to reveal details of the murder of an American army lieutenant by an American army captain. After a delightfully witty exchange, Brenner decides to take the assignment though he knows full well that there is more to this investigation than he (or the reader) has been told. Hellmann wants him to find the Vietnamese witness, if he's still alive. The kicker is that the U.S. government will deny his presence if caught in the midst of the investigation. His \\"retired\\" status provides him with a small amount of plausible deniability if anything should go wrong however, Brenner smells a rat and seriously considers turning down Hellman's order. As you can image, he goes anyway. <br />As Brenner arrives in Saigon, he quickly encounters his chief adversary, security chief Colonel Mang, as well as a beautiful American expatriot named Susan Weber. Strangely to Brenner, Susan winds up being his contact in Saigon and begins to make herself indespensible to Brenner, in a variety of ways. As the story continues to develop, Susan becomes somewhat of a mystery to Brenner AND the reader. Ultimately, she accompanies Brenner on his travels \\"up country.\\" <br />In the end, the path on which Demille leads us empties out into a suspenseful and masterfully completed novel that provides the reader with indepth insight into the cruel atrocities of the Vietnam War. I suspect this truly was a cathartic project for Demille, a former Vietnam veteran. To this end, he vividly describes the issues and battles faced by both countries in trying to deal with a war not so long past. <br />As is typical of DeMille and soundly refreshing in today's literary circles, he delivers his story in a descriptive and witty manner. While the detail in this book dragged at times, that is the only aspect with which I could find fault. The storyline, character development and climax plot are outstanding and exciting. <br />Although a brick of a book, this is a great read. Additionally, I found UP COUNTRY very educational relative to my ignorance of Vietnam, its people and the war. Highly recommended.	2002-05-18
US	52631726	RQ6SM7LJW7OIN	0374155208	501700747	The Fish's Eye: Essays about Angling and the Outdoors	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Fish tales....and other cornucopia	My father has been passionate about fishing for as long as I can remember. I never have been. I didn't have the patience and lets face it, if you're not catching fish, then you're standing there holding a stick dangling string into a monumental body of water. As I've gotten older (and wiser?), I try to fish with my father whenever possible and, preconceived notions aside, I'm really enjoying myself. Consequently, when I ran across Ian Frazier's new offering, THE FISH'S EYE, I immediately purchased a copy for both my father and myself (reading is a passion we share). I thought I might glean some insight into an experienced fisherman's psyche as I read this set of 17 essays and thus, a snapshot of my father's fishing experiences. The essays, written by Mr. Frazier over the last 20+ years and presented in chronological order, present the reader with Frazier's experiences in the fishing life....and his experiences have been wide and varied.<br />As an incredible admission, this reader had no clue that there were people who actually fished in New York City proper (it just didn't seem to fit) but Frazier sets this misnomer to rest in his first essay, \\"Anglers.\\" Here, he describes his experiences of observing and listening to a few of those throwing their lines into one of six ponds in the City's park system near Harlem Meer. <br />One of the better and more detailed essays is \\"An Angler at Heart.\\" This essay details the story of Jim Deren, the owner of Anglers Roost, in none other than New York City! Frazier tells of his many conversations with Deren as he frequents The Roost. This 47-page essay is actually several essays rolled into one, all featuring Deren and his experiences in the fishing life. At one point in the essay, Frazier spends nearly two full pages informing us of the different types of lures one would be confronted with when visiting Angler's Roost. In this reader's opinion, if there is one essay epitomizing the spirit of this book, it would be this particular one.<br />\\"Guiding Guys\\" is a hilarious spoof on fishing guide services. Frazier describes the \\"guarantees\\" one receives in the propaganda distributed by many of these services. In this essay, Frazier writes from the point of view of a guide making just such guarantees of outings ranging from great fishing to extremely great fishing. And, he provides the reader with several different guides to choose from. There's Craig, 6'7\\" and 275 lbs. who grunts and answers in one-word sentences; Potter, who will never stop nagging you the entire outing as to how badly you're doing; and, last but not least, former President Jimmy Carter. Now, you have to pay a little extra for Mr. Carter but its well worth it as the former President will regale you with tales of his Presidency as you sit around the campfire.<br />Perhaps the most poignant essay for me was \\"Fishing Without Dad.\\" This essay is specifically dedicated to Frazier's memory of his father, who never liked to fish and moreover, thought it was cruel. This particular piece details Frazier's penchant for fishing while growing up but without the fatherly advice and companionship he seemed to yearn for. This is probably the most touching piece in the book.<br />The only downside to this collection of essays were those pieces that had absolutely nothing to do with fishing. This fit more into the life stories portion of the book. \\"In The Brain\\" has almost nothing to do with fishing but regales how Frazier tormented his brother (as brothers will do) on family vacations. \\"It's Hard To Eat Just One\\" describes Frazier's experiences with eating his bait, specifically bugs. In my opinion, these pieces (and a couple others) should have been modified or removed as they had very little if anything to do with fishing. <br />Frazier's penchant for spinning a story is outstanding. That said, anyone who loves fishing will enjoy THE FISH'S EYE; anyone who isn't a fisherman at heart will most likely find these tales slow and possibly boring.	2002-05-08

After hearing a bit about the cable-based feature exposing the incredible monopolistic hold De Beers has on the diamond industry and the associated corruption, crime and cruelty associated with diamond mining and the inherent competition, I became acutely aware that the bobbles adorning our fingers, wrists, necks and ears came at a very high price--human as well as financial. To my surprise, I ran across DIAMOND and hoped it would delve deeper into this mysteriously clandestine industry. Matthew Hart unravels the mystery quite well.<br />Hart has a leg up on most journalists penning a book on this trade. His position as editor of the industry trade magazine, \\"Rapaport Diamond Report,\\" provides him with the expertise to report on this cabal industry as well as the background and knowledge to impart the history of the diamond trade. However, Hart does the reader one better by being a genuinely gifted storyteller.<br />Hart lays out the basic foundation and history of diamond geology and its shrouded history. From yarns about hustlers and theives to the geological formations known as pipes, Hart imparts the beauty and dark side of the trade. And, as mentioned, Hart casts his line into the vast monopoly known as De Beers. He explains how De Beers has managed to control the flow of diamonds not only to the wholesale \\"site\\" markets but, more recently, to the retail market as well. We learn how the Oppenheimer family has ruled this industry with an iron fist and a deft touch. Further, and strangely to this reader, we learn the origins of the De Beers name...a totally unexpected twist.<br />Hart informs the reader of great finds and great adventures. He focuses on several large diamonds discoveries - an 81-carat pink from the jungles of Brazil and the discovery of Canada's first major diamond mine. One of the more adventurous stories is that of Eira Thomas, a 24-year-old female geologist who played a major role in the Canadian find. We learn of the painstaking 3-year study and comiseration prior to the actual cutting of the 599-carat Centenary diamond as well as the discovery of the 3,107-carat Cullinan diamond (the largest \\"rough\\" on record). Hart even takes the reader behind the scenes to an advertising agency where a mentally exhausted executive, in a 11th-hour blitz of creative brio, coins the enduring phrase \\"A Diamond is Forever.\\"<br />Hart is engaging, cogent and very well informed. Anyone wanting to learn more about this industry and the mysterious wonder of the \\"beautiful rock,\\" will find this book fascinating reading.and comiseration prior to the actual cutting of the 599-carat Centenary diamond as well as the discovery of the 3,107-carat Cullinan diamond (the largest \\"rough\\" on record).

As an upfront admission, I've never been a fan of Martha Stewart, the person. However, I have marveled at how she and/or her advisors have taken Martha Stewart, the businesswoman, and spun her name into one of the most recognized, adored and deplored names in business today. When I saw the opportunity to glean some insight into this current Leviathan, I jumped at the chance. And, while aware that Christopher Byron had penned the \\"unauthorized\\" version of Ms. Stewart's biography, I felt certain the book would provide some reasonably honest insight into her psyche, intellect, talent and motivation. I wasn't disappointed.<br />MARTHA INC. describes Ms. Stewart as a tireless businesswoman who \\"plays the role\\" rather than living the role. More to the point, Byron goes on to claim that Ms. Stewart has built an empire on the middle class while personally pining for upper class recognition. Mr. Byron loses me here as my interest in this story rests solidly with the philosophies and methodologies behind her meteoric rise, not her politics. Regardless, Byron paints a mixed picture and, in this reviewers opinion, attempts to blow the top off the proverbial can with this expose. As an example, Byron portrays Ms. Stewart as the Ice Queen who literally drove her husband out of their waning marriage not to mention her outright autocratic attitude toward employees AND friends. Surprising? Not really. Mr. Byron has Ms. Stewart as a bellicose brute focused on one thing: Whatever is good for Martha. While this may hold some truth, I suspect we are seeing one reason this biography was unauthorized.<br />On the other hand, it is quite obvious that Mr. Byron is quite adroit at what he does. He quite poignantly offers the reader the striking opinion that some of the personal scrutiny endured by Ms. Stewart arises directly from the fact that she is the CEO of a publicly traded company whose principal asset is, in fact, its CEO! In the era of big business selling conglomerated product linesand hard tangible assets, Ms. Stewart's company MUST sell her to be successful and there is no one better at it than Ms. Stewart herself. Lets face it, most of the items sold by Ms. Stewart's company wouldn't sell without Ms. Stewart pitching it.<br />Mr. Byron presents some fact and some fiction (no doubt) relative to his tale of Ms. Stewart's business career. Obviously, along the successful path of any entrepreneur, feathers will be ruffled. Mr. Byron has ensured that any reader of MARTHA INC. will take away the experience that Ms. Stewart has ruffled many feathers in her tenure. That as it may be, this book provides a reasonable amount of insight into Ms. Stewart, the woman AND Ms. Stewart, the businesswoman. A decent read all-in-all.	2002-04-25
US	52631726	R1QGNGOLUQD33M	0671040634	954792538	World Without End	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A Tremendous Sophomore Effort! Bravo!	Chris Mooney's first book, DEVIANT WAYS, was an incredibly rapturous and complex novel, which is staggering considering it was a freshman effort. In many cases, succeeding offerings can be disappointing when one has had such success with a first attempt. Not so here. WORLD WITHOUT END (WWE) is not only rock solid, I believe it exceeds DEVIANT WAYS with a tighter, more thrilling storyline albeit still as complex.<br />Steve Conway is introduced to the reader initially as a low level CIA computer geek attached to a Black Ops group aptly named IWAC (Information Warfare Analysis Center). However, this is far from where the reader ends up with Steve Conway as Mooney develops his character throughout the book. Conway's CIA liaison and boss, Raymond Brouchard, is described as an incredibly sharp, highly experienced operative and one to whom Steve looks to for \\"guidance.\\" His lover and fellow operative, Pasha Romanov, is as tough and smart as is Conway. These are the three core characters in WWE but represent only a sampling of the numerous characters presented to the reader in this intricate thriller. <br />The storyline follows the trail of \\"Angel Eyes,\\" the notoriously brilliant and evil antagonist who has been stealing state-of-the-art military weapons. The challenge facing IWAC is...they've never been able to catch much less identify Angel Eyes. Moreover, Angel Eyes has yet to utilize his ill-gotten booty, which has IWAC further scratching its collective heads. This faceless fiend previously jacked a white laser weapon designed to temporarily or permanently blind foes. Now, the Company is protecting a cutting edge weapon known as the camouflage suit. This suit has hundreds of computer-synthesized cameras, which identify the wearer's environment and replicate it thus rendering the wearer of the suit invisible! Obviously, the bearer of this type of technology would have immediate and immeasurable power. IWAC is aware that Angel Eyes will make a play for the suit but whenand where is the only question. The CIA and IWAC have been compromised in the past by Angel Eyes via double/triple agents. Who to trust is heaviest cross Conway bears.<br />As Mooney develops the storyline, the reader is taken for a ride of double-crosses and twists that leaves one wondering, \\"What's next?!\\" This, apparently, has become Mooney's MO as DEVIANT WAYS followed this path as well. Mooney does an outstanding job of developing each of the core characters as well as the peripheral players, much more so than many authors. Further and perhaps more importantly, Mooney assists the reader with the technological aspect by explaining the value and workings of the assets compromised (i.e. the white laser and the camouflage suit) without an overabundance of techno-babble. <br />Mooney's adeptness in researching the technological issues and germane uses in his storylines establishes immediate credibility. In fact, in a well-placed \\"Author's Note\\" at the end of the book, Mooney explains where he obtained his ideas for a few of the somewhat unbelievable, futuristic devices portrayed in the story. This leaves the reader scratching his head wondering if these types of devices/weapons will be a reality in the future. Regardless, Mooney makes it as real as is necessary to provide an incredibly thrilling ride. <br />As one reviewer so fittingly mused, one may never look at one's Palm Pilot device the same again after completing this thriller! Highly recommended.	2002-04-24
US	52631726	R1AQ1ERQATQ3MF	019511227X	874873819	The New Oxford American Dictionary	Books	5	43	45	N	N	Wordsmithing made easy.	...<br />The NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY fills the bill quite nicely and in grandiose form. Not only is this tome arguably the best product for the English lexicon currently on the market, it meets the weight test...in spades--at a full 9 pounds! <br />The NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY somewhat breaks with tradition by providing the user with \\"core\\" senses. The core senses appear first for each definition and are followed by subsenses. The uses of \\"senses/subsenses\\" represents the most literal use of the word in the American lexicon rather than the more traditional, according to the publishers. This, in and of itself, makes this dictionary extremely timely and staggeringly useful to significantly any professional, manager or student. <br />One other area which makes this dictionary extremely timely and which has been improved upon by the publishers is the seemingly infinite number of new words and acronyms forged by the presence of the Internet. Although you'll not find all of the poignant slang associated with your surfing activities, you may be surprised at how many you will find. My favorite example (as noted by another reviewer) and one that is used by most who email and participate in chat rooms is \\"LOL\\" (laughing out loud). The advent of this feature will benefit older users of the net much more than the younger ones (LOL)!<br />As with most dictionaries, the pronunciation for each word is provided with its core sense and subsenses. Although somewhat strafed by commercial reviewers, the fact that the pronunciation key is found only in the introduction did not pose a monumental problem for this reviewer. Illustrations are abound in this volume although in black-and-white and greyscale. Again, this seems to be a point of contention for many but I think one has to ask themselves WHY they're using a tool such as this. If its for full-color photography, there are other resources available which would prove more beneficial than a dictionary.<br />Other odds-and-ends...a \\"ready-reference\\" section has been placed at the end of this mammoth. It truly does represent a potpourri of items. A sampling includes: the United States Constitution, Hall of Fame members (baseball, football, basketball and even rock n' roll!), heat index and wind chill matrixes and a variety of other resources. The upside of this strange mix is that it should provide something for everyone, which is what I'm sure the publisher had in mind. <br />Net,net...this is an incredible piece of work and one that every professional should 'invest' in, which is one other nice feature. Its tough to get your hands on a volume this nice for the price featured here on Amazon. All reference tools have shortcomings inasmuch as differing needs exist relative to each user. However, if you need an outstanding dictionary, you'll not go wrong purchasing this one.	2002-04-14

Parker's latest Spenser incarnation, WIDOW'S WALK, I don't think I can answer that question. I suspect that anyone else reviewing this book will come to the same conclusion if they re-read the last 75 pages of the book. As such and given the incredibly high marks given by most reviewers of this book, I fear my review will be quite unpopular.<br />Spenser is hired by the leggy redhead attorney, Rita Fiore (a returning character) to find out who killed Nathan Smith. Smith, a blue blood banker with an impeccable reputation in Boston, was killed in his bed allegedly while his much younger wife, Mary, was watching television in another part of their three-story home. Without the appearance of a break-in or security breach, all circumstantial evidence points to Mary as suicide has been ruled out given the absence of the gun at the crime scene. When Spenser begins questioning Mary, he immediately finds that she lacks the intellectual capacity to string together basic sentences much less understand how or why her husband has been killed. Spenser's not so certain that Mary is deficient in mental faculty department or is putting on a grandiose act.<br />As Spenser begins his investigation, he immediately picks up a tail. After interviewing the Smiths' stockbroker, Spenser is accosted by the two tailing thugs. In true Spenser fashion, he provides his would-be attackers with the beating they so richly deserve. Shortly thereafter, people directly and peripherally attached to this case begin dying in savage order. Parker takes the reader through the typical investigatory scheme and provides a climax that left this reader scratching his head.  <br />I've read all of Parker's Spenser novels and typically wait anxiously for the next offering. However, with this particular novel, I'm wondering what Bob was thinking. He maintains his easy-to-read chapters and storyline cadence of previous Spenser offerings but in this reviewer's opinion, that's about it. Several things were missing here: 1) a heavy dose of Spenser witticisms {Parker typically has me laughing out loud with Spenser's one-liners; not so here}, 2) an incredible lack of Hawk and his captivating mannerisms {if one is a true fan of Spenser, you know what I mean), 3) lack of character development of the resident villain (I don't know what to say here; Parker has an uncanny knack of providing the reader the psyche of the book's villain; not so in WIDOW'S WALK), and 4) WHO KILLED NATHAN SMITH?! As to my last comment here, the individual(s) responsible for the death of Nathan Smith is never disclosed.<br />All in all, a very disappointing Spenser for me however, as a true fan, I'll be there for the next offering.	2002-04-12
US	52631726	R3SZK0306G2048	0375411070	628573598	Basket Case	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Sex, Death, Rock n Roll......and Journalism?	This was my first trek into a Hiaasen novel so other than previously perused reviews, I didn't know what to expect. After completing the book, I can say quite simply, Hiaasen lives up to his hype. However, he appears to be one of those authors that you either really like or really don't like. Check out the reviews on virtually any of his previous offerings. You'll see what I mean.<br />BASKET CASE introduces Jack Tagger, a former hotshot reporter whose maverick bravado (read: BIG mouth) land him in the most ostracized, deplorable position on any newspaper staff: the new star reporter for the obituaries. Jack's current descent was a direct result of his disdain for the current CEO of the public syndicate (\\"Wall Street Whorehoppers\\" as Jack calls them) owning the Union-Register. This disdain exhibited itself in the form of an expletive-laced rant at a shareholder's meeting, thus Jack's departure to Siberia. <br />Jack finds himself under the thumb of a woefully inexperienced editor, Emma Cole. Jack and Emma have a vituperative relationship at best. He toils daily at two meaningful tasks: finding the next story that will vault him back to where he belongs (on page ONE) and mentally pistol-whipping anyone in authority, currently Emma.<br />Hiaasen provides a bit of dark color to Jack's character manifested in a strange neurosis whereby Jack compares his own age with that of famous people who have died at the same age. At the beginning of BASKET CASE, Jack is 46 years old. Naturally then (if you're an obit writer), he obsesses over the untimely deaths of JFK, Jack London, The King (Elvis), and George Orwell who all died at age 46. His distributes this neurotic peculiarity daily to his family and friends who rightfully believe that writing the obits has ruefully invaded and is tormenting Jack's soul. <br />To the storyline....Jack believes he may be on to the \\"Big One\\" when he becomes intrigued with the death notice of one James Bradley Stomarti. A quick bit of investigation leads Jack to the fact that Stomarti is really burnt-out sleaze rocker Jimmy Stoma, the 39-year-old lead singer for Jimmy and the Slut Puppies. Stoma's accidental drowning in the Bahamas strikes Jack as newsworthy and suspicious, and his widow, wannabe rock star Cleo Rio (a/k/a Cynthia Jane Zigler), can't convince Jack that Jimmy's death was accidental. These peculiarities offer Jack a way out of his neurotic job-related fixation and his increasingly lusty feelings for his schoolmarm editor, Emma.<br />As Jack throws himself into the investigation, his claims of foul play appear supportable when he discovers there are no stitches in Stoma's body despite an autopsy. Meanwhile, the remaining members of the Slut Puppies begin to die at an inordinately rapid pace. In describing these untimely demises and other scrapes, Hiaasen throws the reader a bit of violent color...a sampling: one head crushed by a garbage truck, a bullet for each buttock for the former SP bassist, and a severe but not fatal beating with a 26-pound frozen Savannah monitor lizard (aptly named \\"Colonel Tom\\"). <br />In his quest for the truth, Jack enlists Emma, who has now found a place in his heart initially, by the variety of colors she sports on her toenails. Jack's investigative crew also includes Juan, a sportswriter colleague, Carla, a club-savvy teenager who is also the daughter of Jack's ex-girlfriend, and a 12-year-old maniacal hacker who helps crack the lyrical bytes on a garbled hard drive.<br />Hiaasen is known for his biting humor and BASKET CASE is full of examples. Describing a wannabe producer, \\"he couldn't get into the Grammys with an AK-47;\\" and, during a verbal showdown with CEO Race Maggad, III, \\"When you were little, did they call you MASTER Race Maggad?\\" or, when Jack's sportswriter friend, Juan, remarks, \\"the Dolphins just signed a running back with no felony record and no drug habit,\\" adding, \\"That's big news.\\" There are dozens of Hiaasen-isms that are quite simply, hilarious.<br />My only criticisms of BASKET CASE revolve around a couple of unexplained inconsistencies in the storyline. One in particular deals with a scheme hatched by the former owner (MacArthur Polk) of the Union-Register that would have Jack playing spoiler to \\"MASTER Race Maggad\\" in a fun-but-dark con game. The scheme was all predicated upon Jack's authorship of Polk's obituary when the fateful moment arrived. Although Jack didn't pen the obit, he DID become Polk's partner in collusion. This inconsistency was never explained. Regardless, this does not detract from the overall storyline or theme.<br />BASKET CASE is pure journalism, death, sex, and rock 'n' roll. A great combination and a fun read.	2002-04-11

While Carville is known as the \\"Rajun Cajun\\" and typically receives the majority of the press, Begala is razor sharp in wit and tongue alike. Together, they're a relatively lethal combination. While I didn't purchase this book for their political insights and regaling of campaign successes, one can't help but be a bit impressed with the message they've composed in BUCK UP, SUCK UP. But, only a bit.<br />Carville and Begala, fresh out of current campaign work, decided to collaborate on their combined experiences in the election process and extrapolate it to the business/self-help genre. In the end, the principles they gleaned from their experiences are condensed into a 220 page book providing the self-help denizen with new fodder. The result is, well, somewhat chaotic and mixed.<br />The subtitle of the book, \\"12 Winning Secrets from the War Room\\" suggest that Carville and Begala will provide the unsuspecting reader with insightful suggestions to \\"beat the game.\\" Well, not really. While some of the 12 Secrets are thought-provoking, others fall short of anything but basic common sense. Let's look at a few: 1) Kiss {Tail}; 2) Kick {Tail}; 3) Be Open; 4) Know How to Communicate...you get the idea. (By the way, my bracketing {} was necessary to appease the censors.) While its easy to see that some of the suggestions Carville and Begala offer are clearly gleaned from their political experience (\\"Frame the Debate,\\" \\"Understand the Difference between Strategy and Tactics\\"), others appear to be simple rules of life. In short, BUCK UP, SUCK UP is less a book of \\"Secrets\\" exciting to the politicos and wannabes than one of basic, simple rules of thumb for politics, business, and life. <br />One area which hits home for the business crowd is their rant on micromanaging. Carville and Begala tutor the reader on campaign failures as a result of candidates and staff becoming hung up on the minutiae. For instance, one sure-fire issue on the road to failure is \\"how campaign headquarters answers the phone.\\" They go on to inform us that many candidates spend the lionshare of their strategic thinking(?) on these types of issues and never think about how average voters are perceiving them. This holds true for most professions and those operating/managing businesses. While being a detail person has its merits, the big picture is the entrepreneur's path to success. Hire the detail guys; you can't hire visionaries.<br />BUCK UP, SUCK UP doesn't meet the traditional definition of a political read by a long shot although it is written by two VERY, VERY political individuals. Regardless, it is quite obvious that Carville and Begala had great fun writing the book. It is laced with anecdotes and stories which hold the reader's attention. This, by itself, earned a couple of stars. <br />At 220 pages, BUCK UP, SUCK UP is a very quick read. The book is designed to be a basic, quick-and-dirty self-help guide. If you're well-versed and experienced in political offerings, this book holds nothing for you. If you have political aspirations, this book is probably a reasonable primer. If you are looking for inspiration in the form of a self-help book, this book is simply adequate.	2002-03-31

Think of the leaders you admire. Think of the leaders you hold in disdain. What are the comparisons and contrasts? What MAKES a good leader? Integrity, commitment, intelligence, flexibility, sensitivity and a variety of other attributes? <br />History has manifested the stereotypical successful leader as highly intelligent with a backbone of steel. In addition, they are calm in the face of diversity, consistent with praise and criticism (a/k/a One Minute Manager), rational relative to decisionmaking, dispassionate toward inefficiences and, perhaps above all, outstanding listeners. They don't play office politics or change their personal management style to build the necessary relationships with their management team. <br />Hold the presses! According to Daniel Goleman, intelligence, experience and being blessed with a strong skill set are no longer considered THE poignant indicators of a successful leader. Emotional intelligence or \\"EQ\\" is the ability to understand and manage oneself as well as a variety of interpersonal relationships. Mr. Goleman espouses that EQ is considered a better leadership differentiator than raw talent, a soaring IQ, or technical mastery. With his arguably breakthrough book EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE, Goleman has solidly established his place in history as the authority on EQ. He makes the case that sensitivity to emotions in the workplace and mastering interpersonal communication skills are the essential competencies for a leader's success. However, Mr. Goleman warns that EQ doesn't mean that one acts or becomes more emotional. Rather, he describes it as the ability to combine rational and subjective factors to perceptions and actions.<br />In PRIMAL LEADERSHIP, Mr. Goleman teams with Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee, acknowledged experts in the EI (or EQ) research field, to investigate and report upon the positive and negative attributes of EQ relative to today's leaders. PRIMAL LEADERSHIP establishes the premise that a leader's emotions area primary factor to the motivational generation of energy and enthusiasm in any organization. Further, the authors warn the reader that this type of \\"emotion gushing\\" is a must for any organization to thrive, much less, survive. While this basic concept flys in the face of conventional wisdom regarding most learned students of leadership, it will get your attention and send you into immediate introspection (at least, that was my reaction). Goleman et al contend that a leader's emotional makeup (read: \\"mood\\") have a direct correlation to the health of a company's finances. Quite a new concept indeed. <br />PRIMAL LEADERSHIP is framed around the concepts and discussions relative to the \\"dimensions\\" of EI, the different types of leadership styles, the steps toward becoming a positive (well-rounded EQ) leader, and, of course, a \\"how-to\\" on establishing EQ as the mantra to building a better business.  <br />Be prepared to think in the abstract, a concept many leaders may struggle with. Entrepreneurs deal with this type of \\"outside-the box\\" thinking every day. Most managers do not. This book will challenge the entrepreneur to strive for a humanistic touch within their vision. On the other hand, PRIMAL LEADERSHIP will assist the manager/executive in reaching new levels of introspection and thought-provocation. The concepts presented here should not be dismissed. RECOMMENDED.	2002-03-31

However...he hit a dry spell with VIOLETS ARE BLUE as a result of his seemingly incredible faux pas at the end of ROSES ARE RED (i.e. he TOLD us the identity of the Mastermind thus rendering one-half of the \\"BLUE\\" storyline impotent). Nevertheless, in 2ND CHANCE, the Women's Murder Club theme is solid and has panache.<br />Our new hero, Lindsay Boxer, had her life ripped apart in the first rendition of Patterson's Women's Murder Club, 1ST TO DIE, simply an outstanding thriller if you've not read it. 2ND CHANCE opens with Lindsay, now a Lieutenant, on sabbatical attempting to heal the wounds inflicted upon her, mentally and physically, in 1ST. Although unsure of the timing of her return, it becomes etched in stone when a young girl is gunned downed in front of a church by a sadistic sniper.<br />During her investigation, it quickly becomes apparent that this attack wasn't random rather, the young girl was a specific target. Further investigation leads Lindsay to a symbol, ultimately determined to be a Chimera. Just as quickly as the clues begin to dry up, an apparent suicide in Oakland is suddenly thrust into homicide status when Lindsay finds a chalk drawing of a Chimera at the scene. Lindsay now has her hands full with another serial. However, Lindsay has another problem; with the two murders linked, the murderer appears to be sending a racially-motivated message as both victims were black.<br />The plot thickens with another sniper-like murder, this time the victim is a cop. However, the killer doesn't stop there. In bold fashion, he steps up and delivers an incredible blow to Lindsay and the City with the very public murder of a highly visible individual (I'll leave it to the unsuspecting reader to find out!). With the politicos calling the spree racial, the heat has been turned up to high. Although Lindsay is now incensed, her investigation appears to be sending the message that the murderer isn't targeting race. Just where is this sadistic sniper leading her?<br />As introduced in 1ST, Lindsay calls upon her \\"investigative team,\\" the members of the Women's Murder Club. Each member brings varied and pertinent skills and experience to the table. Claire is the medical examiner, Cindy, a newspaper reporter and Jill, the assistant D.A. As in 1ST, the Club is able, through its incredible spectrum of informational sources, to break down the mystique behind the Chimera and trace its roots...the prison system.<br />2ND CHANCE is Patterson's unheralded return to the thriller. While he appeared to be slumping in his last few Alex Cross renditions, 2ND CHANCE has the making of a solid performer. As always and almost in Patterson trademark form, 2ND CHANCE is a fast-paced read (a/k/a Patterson's \\"short\\" chapters) which makes the book tough to put down. The storyline remains relatively fresh throughout albeit corny in spots.<br />One off-tangent (which ultimately becomes ON-tangent) line is Lindsay's reunion with her estranged father, Marty. Marty left his family when Lindsay was a teenager and now, he's come back to make amends with his daughter. Marty becomes a beneficial character; as such, its important to know that he was formerly a cop.<br />Although 2ND CHANCE didn't \\"thrill\\" me the way 1ST TO DIE did, it is a fun, intriguing read. The members of the Women's Murder Club are intelligent and grounded...and fun. My hope is that Patterson continues to search for storylines which run the edge of the envelope.<br />2ND CHANCE won't disappoint.where is this sadistic sniper leading her? <br />As introduced in 1ST, Lindsay calls upon her \\"investigative team,\\" the members of the Women's Murder Club.

US	52631726	R394D3C7FUQARX	0060392452	194848581	Stupid White Men ...And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation!	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Chainsaw Mike - The Grey Knight	When I picked this book up, I must admit that I was looking for a Carlin-esque theme or, Carlin-light perhaps. While not disappointed, I must say that Mr. Moore has an interesting take on many of the issues facing our nation and world today. Some, well, are ludicrous but others are surprisingly well-founded.<br />Mr. Moore (until now perhaps) is best known for his piercing and slapstick humor on his much-maligned and ill-fated television shows &quot;TV Nation&quot; and &quot;The Awful Truth.&quot; I never viewed either but have read a variety of magazine exposes on the shows, none of which were particularly favorable to Mr. Moore, his views or his intellect. However, this reader found some nuggets of truth under the cloud of dark humor in STUPID WHITE MEN. While I would not place Mr. Moore in a category for bi-partisan objectiveness, he makes several thought-provoking points.<br />STUPID WHITE MEN begins with the question: &quot;You can choose between two political parties that sound alike, vote alike, and are funded alike by the same exact wealthy donors. You can choose to wear nondescript pastels and keep your mouth shut, or you can choose to wear a Marilyn Manson T-shirt and get kicked out of school. Britney or Christina, WB or UPN, Florida or Texas-there ain't no friggin' difference, folks, it's all the same, it's all the same, it's all the same... How did all this happen?&quot; The answer...&quot;STUPID WHITE MEN!&quot;<br />Thus begins Mr. Moore's tirade (attack, maybe?) on the threads of society. The opening question is followed by what can only be described as a personal evisceration of the man Mr. Moore holds at the highest level of SWM disdain, President George W. Bush. He lays out his &quot;Coup&quot; theory relative to the botched Florida election and has a few &quot;stupid&quot; words for Dub's brother, Jeb. He doesn't stop there. Mr. Moore goes on to espouse his abhorrence for our nation's leadership ineptness (all partisanship aside) and to the possibly daft realization that everyone who's ever done him wrong has been a SWM. His gunslinger approach fires at racism, education, all politicians, and yes, the toilet habits of American men. Thrown into the mix are Mr. Moore's many rules for improving one's life, from running for office to how to become a Hindu. As advertised, there's some comic relief as well, such as a lame parody of Bush's daily schedule.<br />Mr. Moore does make a convincing argument that the policies of the Clinton administration vary little from those of the Bush administration thus confirming his theory that the parties are indistinguishable. And this leads the reader into the real message of SWM, a ringing endorsement of Ralph Nader's Green Party movement. Mr. Moore encourages the reader to step up to the plate and bat for your independent candidate: &quot;There will be more Independents in the coming years; it can't be helped. Actually that's not true. It has been helped - greatly - by the actions/inactions of the Democratic-Republican Party.&quot; Its hard to argue with this rhetoric except to say that it is subordinated to Mr. Moore's somewhat arcane peripheral views.<br />An interesting sidenote to SWM, Mr. Moore endured an incredible plethora of red tape just to get this book published due to the events of 9-11. His publisher, Harper Collins, wanted him to rewrite significant portions of the book critical of the president because it wasn't proper when the Bush administration had a 90% approval rating. For nearly four months, Mr. Moore &quot;did not know whether the book was ever going to be read by the American public,&quot; Moore wrote in a &quot;Dear Friends&quot; e-mail on February 6, 2002. &quot;HarperCollins, one of the major publishing houses in the world, was trying to decide whether the words I had written were now 'too offensive' to a nation which had suddenly fallen in love with George W. Bush.&quot;<br />Moore stood his ground and, contrary to his soapbox style, politicked andlobbied for the the expeditious release of his book without edit. Obviously, word of his &quot;plight&quot; got out through one of his speaking engagements and, lo and behold, Harper Collins was inundated with letters asking them to release the book, unedited. Eventually, HarperCollins relented...to everything. SWM went to press exactly as he had written it.<br />My summary...in surprising fashion, be prepared to think. While not the endall of social and political essays, Mr. Moore will open a few doors in your mind that may have been previously closed.	2002-03-17
US	52631726	R26XBACHNLY406	0385502257	350529279	Winning Decisions: Getting It Right the First Time	Books	4	74	79	N	N	Well, so what are you going to do?	A relative glut of periodicals and books exist on decisionmaking, whether personally or professionally. Many have solid foundations, many are commercialized tripe. In MAKING DECISIONS, authors Russo and Shoemaker hit on a timely subject for professional managers or entrepreneurs. The economy has plummeted and the stock market has deflated propelling each individual responsble for their company's path to success into crucial, perhaps vital decisions on a daily basis. And the rapid rate of change is forcing all executives and managers to make decisions faster.<br />Given the current environment, it is well worth the time to revisit an executive/manager's most basic of tasks: making a decision...a subject devoid of attention except in academic journals or business books. In a straightforward, well-presented fashion, the authors break down the decisionmaking process into four steps:<br />1. Framing or deciding what you are going to decide-and not decide; <BR>2. Gathering intelligence-real intelligence, and not just information that will support your internal biases; <BR>3. Coming to conclusions-determining how your company acts on the intelligence it gathers, and; <BR>4. Learning from experience. <br />The authors guide the reader through each of the steps providing insight into the process, highlighting key concepts, and providing case studies and worksheets so the reader can begin to track their own issues at hand. Russo and Shoemaker have presented this material in such a way as to demystify the &quot;process&quot; of decisionmaking. The &quot;process&quot; gets so much attention as being clandestine, complex and erudite. However, by providing a detailed framework reflecting a relatively mechanical and logical process to making a decision, the authors have uncorked the mystery. When confronted with the need to assess a situation, gather information and reach a decision, most managers depend on a hit-or-miss approach. This approach is different from executive-to-executive and is measured relative to the frequency and experience an executive may have &quot;putting out the proverbial fire.&quot; While there's nothing inherently wrong or incorrect about this type of venerable process, this process typically results in a lower-end spectrum result when nothing but mid-high to high results will suffice as a necessary competitive edge.<br />The alternative approach presented by the authors allows executives/managers to reframe issues by asking such questions as &quot;What is the crux of the issue that I am facing?&quot; so that they don't end up solving the wrong problem (i.e. analogous to &quot;looking from the outside in&quot;). It also allows them to increase their options by doing such things as &quot;not necessarily taking yes for an answer,&quot; when it comes to initial research findings. In fact, these alternatives may result in something quite creative and innovative, a veritable whack on the side of the head.<br />As they should, the authors stress to the reader that improving one's decisionmaking skills is not an ironclad guarantee to success. Execution of a solid operating (business) plan and being in the right place at the right time (luck) are factors tantanmount to any successful venture. However, it is rational and logical that if one makes better decisions, one's odds of success are bound to increase. And, as one gains experience in making decisions and acting upon the achieved results, desired or not, success rates grow exponentially. <br />A solid read.	2002-03-10
US	52631726	RFTQ1MUTT3PKX	0814471293	132096886	Focal Point: A Proven System to Simplify Your Life, Double Your Productivity, and Achieve All Your Goals	Books	4	128	130	N	N	&quot;X&quot; marks the spot; solid concepts yet repetitive.	Brian Tracy is one of the premier motivational/professional development speakers in the U.S. today. He has written several books and given hundreds of seminars (and continues to do so) on the subject(s). FOCAL POINT is his latest offering; a self-proclaimed process previously available only to his private clients who &quot;unhesitatingly&quot; paid thousands of dollars for his private coaching. While I have no doubt about this fact (that clients have paid thousands of dollars), this represents a bit of unnecessary commercial hype. Regardless, Mr. Tracy's reputation and knowledge base command attention.<br />The Focal Point Process is simplistically defined as self-analysis (introspection) of the actions/areas generating the best results in various aspects of one's life and those actions/areas consuming inordinate amounts of one's time yet generating moderate-to-poor results. After this bit of introspection, Tracy informs the reader to apply &quot;Zero-based Thinking&quot; to each activity: &quot;Knowing what I know now, if I were not doing this now, would I start it up again today?&quot; In other words, even though I perform this task/duty periodically, if I had the choice to start again, would I continue to perform this task/duty? This type of conceptual thinking is truly the poignant theme within the book and, in my opinion, germane and applicable to most.<br />Tracy leaks in more commercial tripe with the lead-in, &quot;Double your income, double your time off&quot; on page 9. This &quot;claim&quot; is based on the well-publicized yet empirically correct 80/20 rule. The 80/20 rule stipulates that one spends 80% of one's time generating 20% of one's results while 20% of one's time is spent generating 80% of one's results. With a few general exceptions, this rule is accurate, particularly to one's professional life. Tracy then takes this concept a step further and says if one were to 'concentrate' on the 20% activities and eliminate the 80% activities, one will have the capability to &quot;double your income, double your time off.&quot; Not an altogether dismissive thought yet, once again, commercial.<br />The meat of FOCAL POINT is then spent on identifying the various Focal Points (&quot;X&quot; marks the spot is his mantra) in the reader's life, illustrating the concept of Zero-based Thinking to each area and finally proposing application of the 80/20 rule to each. While this is repetitive in nature, it is a reasonable roadmap to develop a personal/professional foundation for future achievement. In many ways, Tracy takes our current day modeling guru, Anthony Robbins, to task by implying that success can be achieved through self-analysis and introspection and modeling the 20% tasks (as opposed to Robbins' theory of modeling other successful individuals). This is a solid concept.<br />On page 199, Tracy reaches the finality of his coaching by providing the reader with his &quot;Seven Lessons for the 21st Century&quot; as follows [paraphrasing]:<br />1. Life gets better when you get better,<BR>2. Where you've been doesn't matter; only where you're going,<BR>3. One must fail to succeed,<BR>4. Freedom comes through development of options,<BR>5. See the good out of every problem or difficulty (i.e. learn the lesson),<BR>6. You can learn anything you need for success through proper goal-setting, and<BR>7. The only limits to success are within your mind.<br />These &quot;lessons&quot; do not cover any new ground in personal/professional development theory. However, Tracy does provide the reader with a backdrop for practical application and, ultimately, realization of one's goals. A fitting summarization to the book's message.<br />For anyone new to personal/professional development theory, this is an outstanding book for gleaning conceptual foundations. My only warning is don't EXPECT the &quot;Double your...&quot; theory to come to fruition without much trial-and-error. For those learned in the theories, it is a reasonable refresher and provides a new spin for condensed introspection.<br />Worth the read.	2002-03-09

AND leaves him there!<br />For those who have read Greg Iles and love him (who doesn't?), Chris Mooney will be a nice addition to your repertoire. A relatively new author, DEVIANT WAYS is Mooney's first offering and I can only hope that he does not suffer from the disease often plauging new writers, Freshman Success.<br />...<br />So here's the deal, typically, a thriller has \\"stop-and-go\\" action. Not so with DEVIANT WAYS. Mooney keeps the reader involved with every chapter, literally. He has achieved this interactive involvement by creating surprise twists. As he sets up a situation with a seemly logical outcome, he'll shock the reader with a pardoxical twist. ... there are a couple of blunders within the storyline (something a good editor should have caught) but this does not detract from quality of the book. Another area that Mooney seems to have a natural talent for is character development. With the exception of Fletcher, we don't have any superhumans in this book. Rather, this book reflects the innate flaws that every human possesses. Mooney does an outstanding job of building each character's strengths but then throws humanity at us with the expected ideosyncracies.<br />As earlier stated, Mooney's knack seems to be his ability to maintain the level of action to keep the reader on edge. He uses the technique of ending a chapter in the middle of an action sequence propelling the reader to the next chapter automatically. A very effective tool as it makes it difficult to put the book down. <br />I've already purchased Mooney's second book just based on this read alone. This is about the highest compliment I can give an author. Sure, Mooney will continue to develop his skills and will only get better but hey, I want to be there for the entire ride.	2002-03-09

THE TIPPING POINT starts out with the true tale of the resurgence of the dowdy shoe, the Hush Puppie. Yep, the Hush Puppie. Why? Specifically, to identify and explain the REASON for the shoe's resurgence; a resurgence that would find Hush Puppies embraced by fashion designers and the New York club scene.<BR> <BR>In the mid-1990s, the Hush Puppie became so unpopular that Wolverine, its manufacturer, almost discontinued the line. However, just prior to pulling the trigger on discontinuation, the Hush Puppie suddenly became all the rage and the accessory of choice. Fashion designers including Isaac Mizrahi were seen wearing the shoes. The feeding frenzy for Hush Puppies grew at such an exponential level that Wolverine saw its sales quadruple in 1996. <br />Was this meteoric rise due to an intensive or gimicky marketing effort by the company?. Not by a long shot. The truth: a few people began wearing the shoes in downtown Manhattan clubs...to be different...and viola', the trend was sparked. (If you want to understand the mathematics behind the concept (formulation) of the tipping point, read the endnote relative to the explanation on page 12. This provides an outstanding \\"definition.\\")<br />This is the perfect example of how many of our societal trends begin - by a few people or a few small changes stimulating different actions by populations and sub-populations. These changes comprise the concept of THE TIPPING POINT. <br />Gladwell uses examples like the Hush Puppies craze or the drop in New York City's crime rate to demonstrate his theory of the tipping point, or the moment when an idea, trend or social behavior crosses a certain threshold before it catches on. In other words, a very small change in a standard iteration that causes the activity or action to \\"snowball.\\" What makes these things or ideas catch on is often a product of something much smaller than expected. <br />The three rules Gladwell outlines for the reader defining the tipping point - the Law of theFew, the Stickiness Factor and the Power of Context - show how a seemingly insignificant event or person can have a major effect. The \\"law of the few,\\" for instance, shows that, as in the story of Paul Revere, it often takes just one person to start a movement. There are certain people in life who have a talent for bringing people together and disseminating information, and those people are often pivotal to making things happen. The \\"stickiness factor\\" is also critical - if something doesn't \\"stick\\" with people, it will never catch on. The \\"power of context\\" indicates that circumstances often affect how people behave and how well ideas or trends spread. Once again, it's often the smaller groups that affect big change.<BR>     <BR>Gladwell offers insight to a daily subject of society's subconcious and gives it a name, a definition and a scale to measure the effect. While he doesn't break new ground here, Gladwell has offered the reader insight and research into the wonderous and strange events that create \\"wildfires.\\" Again, while this book will not provide any substantive education, it is a fascinating read relative to how events become events.	2002-02-22

Intrigued immediately by the title, I was able to pick up an early copy of DOT.CON, a new offering by New Yorker staff writer John Cassidy. Even before donning the covers of this book, the title brought back memories, good and not-so-good, recounting the most turbulent and interesting perior in stock market history since the '29 Crash.<br />While the mania surrounding the internet has not waned, the investment in \\"Dot.Com's\\" certainly has. The internet is here to stay however, we now know that the vast array of companies attempting to capitalize on the Net's popularity won't be as fortunate. Conversely, reliving the days of pugnacious entrepreneurs who were nothing more than keyboard simpletons, neophyte investors puffing their way through cocktail parties touting their latest security conquests and mindless, self-appointed gurus pontificating their seemingly clairvoyant ability to call the market (Miss Cleo makes these claims doesn't she?) was not necessarily something I considered worth remembering at present. However, I mustered all my courage and pushed on past the first page. I'm glad I did as Cassidy does a masterful job of highlighting the follies and tragedies of this short-lived era.<br />Cassidy draws many historical comparisons into his support for the development of the Net \\"Bubble\\" and offers fresh insight into some of the orchestrated(?) events occurring behind the scenes as many first-time investors waited for the next merger announcement (do you still watch CNBC with your morning coffee?). His historical elocution takes the reader to the manias of the past supporting his hypothesization that the Net debacle was waiting in the wings for the unsuspecting investing public. He takes us back to the first mechanical computer in 1931 and works his way forward offering layman explanations for many Net buzzwords, definitions as solid as any Internet Dictionary. Similarly, Cassidy is very thorough in his review of the background of many of the early and primeNet players including, in many cases, information on their childhood, eduction, early careers (although many here were in their early careers when the Bubble burst), and what brought them to the forefront of this incredible story. <br />Cassidy focuses much of his energy, research and rhetoric on the happenings behind the scenes. He spoke to me when he began enumerating the obscure ways in which the Fed, Wall Street, VCs and promoters continued to stoke the Net fire even while it was primed to implode. He hits the nail on the head when he writes that VCs {and others} were using companies to create stocks instead of the fundamental methodology of using the stock market to raise capital to build companies. This point, among others, is critically poignant. <br />Much to my appreciation, Cassidy extolls mightily the role played by Alan Greenspan in this comedy. Many believe Greenspan to be the culprit who burst the Bubble with his monotonous albeit eviscerating interest rate hikes and comments like \\"irrational exuberance.\\" Cassidy leans in this direction yet I believe his position to be a personal conviction rather than a technical indictment. (In my opinion, Cassidy relates this information in relatively non-biased terms.) Self-dealing and greed were the culprits here not one individual.<br />Overall, an enjoyable read although, as I mentioned earlier, the wounds are still a bit fresh to be rubbing salt in them (thus...4 stars). This will be a wonderful history book in 20 years or should I say, self-help book....\\"How Not to Invest Your Money.\\" Pick it up; its worth the read.	2002-02-02

When I am notified of a pending release of a new book by Baldacci, I immediately pre-order it. That said, while LAST MAN STANDING is clearly not Baldacci's best effort, it is still an intriguing book.<br />Web London is the leader of a team within the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team (HRT). HRT can be considered akin to the Navy Seals, Delta, Rangers....the elite. The book opens with Web and his team on a routine mission (if any HRT mission can be considered routine). As they initiate, Web's team is savagely cut down by massive machine gun fire yet Web is seemingly frozen by fear and literally cannot move a muscle. When the smoke clears, every member of his HRT team is dead and he is the \\"last man standing.\\"<br />Web goes through an enormous amount of guilt and introspection as a result of this catastrophe. Not to mention, the internal scrutiny he receives from his FBI superiors and the pugnacious attitude of the other HRT teams. As he begins to investigate this slaughter, Web begins to think that a leak within the FBI's own ranks might be at issue. At the same time, Web meets up with Francis \\"Big F\\" Westbrook, the most feared gang leader in the city. Big F takes a special interest in the assault on HRT that leads Web to a group of neofacists called The Frees, led by a jailed Ernest B. Free. As Web begins to piece together the puzzle between Westbrook, the Frees and the FBI leak, he begins meeting with Claire Daniels, a freelance psychologist for the FBI, in an attempt to \\"cleanse\\" himself of the events that led to his HRT team's massacre.<br />At this point, the story begins to go into many, many different directions albeit all tied together in a nice, neat package by Mr. Baldacci by the last page. This, more than anything else, is why I believe most of the negative reviews are present relative to this offering.

Many of the Amazon reviews are, in my opinion, accurate relative to a degradation from USED AND RARE, the Goldstone's first book extolling their rare book exploits. However, SLIGHTLY CHIPPED is nevertheless a fun and enticing read.<br />In USED AND RARE, the Goldstone's are introduced to the world of used and rare (appropo title) books via a bet to purchase a substantive yet cheap birthday present. USED AND RARE throws the reader into the incredibly obscure but fascinating &quot;cult&quot; of rare book collecting. For the bibliophile, this is analogous to an &quot;edge of your seat&quot; mystery. For the unafflicted, perhaps just a different albeit fun ride. SLIGHTLY CHIPPED is the sequel (Book 2 of 3 in the series) to USED AND RARE and continues the Goldstone's journey toward &quot;BiblioNhirvana.&quot; By the way, Book 3 in this series is WARMLY INSCRIBED (if interested).<br />SLIGHTLY CHIPPED finds the Goldstones as now seasoned collectors of rare books and dives into a variety of peripheral side stories which detracts from the &quot;romance&quot; of the original storyline. Perhaps the most interesting tangental story in this offering was the Goldstones venture to the Rosenbach Museum in Philadelphia. This foray was specifically to view the manuscript to Bram Stoker's DRACULA. They go into great detail in describing the Museum, Stoker's biohistory, and the manuscript itself. This is truly a fascinating story.<br />On the other side of the coin, we are subjected to the same level of detail regarding Bloomsbury. I'll not bore you with the detail of this equally obscure mini-series of books except to say that while potentially entertaining, it was out of place in this book. This type of off-tangent minutae is the only reason this book is &quot;slightly chipped.&quot; <br />Another side story is the auction of the contents of the Duke and Duchess of Windor by Sothebys. This auction ultimately brought approximately $24 million and included a number of collectible books. The Goldstones go into great detail as to how they obtained admittance to the auction (as contract writers for &quot;Biblio&quot; magazine) to the procedural aspects of the auction itself. This discussion is interesting, if for no other reason than to glean the details of an auction of this size and notoriety. <br />One of the more poignant issues raised by the Goldstones is their discussion of the internet's dramatic and unexpected (at least to them) impact on rare book collecting. This reader picked up numerous resources to locate and secure first editions and other rare tomes. Its quite obvious that the internet is becoming the leader in used and rare book offerings.<br />This should be considered a solid followup to USED AND RARE albeit less entertaining. Still, if collectibles or general book knowledge is your cup of tea, you will absolutely enjoy this book. A word of caution: read these books in order 1) USED AND RATE and then 2) SLIGHTLY CHIPPED.	2002-01-11
US	52631726	R23ZDWZA5OQIDZ	0312156820	27139926	Used and Rare: Travels in the Book World	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Although not rare, this book is a treasure.	What an uncommonly wonderful book! For bibliophiles or those that enjoy reading about a passionate quest, USED AND RARE is a delight.<br />This is a factual \\"novel\\" written by Larry and Nancy Goldstone relating their journey into the world of used and rare books. This is a story that began as a quest for a budget-based, inexpensive gift which ultimately turned to an exciting addiction. The inexpensive beginning was the search and purchase of a [amt] copy of Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE, a complete translation which included maps and fold-out color illustrations. When it arrived in the mailed, the book included a business card from the bookseller which subsequently prompted the Goldstones to make their way to the bookstore on a lazy Sunday afternoon. There, they met David and Esther Kininmonth, the owners of the store. David enthralled the Goldstones with a oratory into the basics of the world of rare books, their value, illusion and mystery. It was with this visit and conversation that the Goldstone's were vaulted into a path that soon became a passionate obsession. <br />Now intrigued and beset with an insatiable desire for new \\"quarry,\\" the Goldstones began making as many trips as possible to various East Coast cities visting antiquarian book dealers and attending book fairs and auctions. Armed with a growing knowledge of this rather obscure industry, they diligently sought out first editions, single leather-bound volumes and sets, and rare out-of-print books. Along the way, they became as fascinated with the learning process associated with procuring rare books as much as by the books themselves. After spending quite a bit of time buying, reading and picking the brains of the experts, the Goldstones began to see through many of the games played by the dealers including pricing inconsistencies, show tactics and auction fax paus'. <br />Although extremely frugal and budget-conscious, USED AND RARE tells the story of how the Goldstones began with that [amt] copy of WAR AND PEACE to owning a [amt] edition of Charles Dickens's MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT. In one passage, the Goldstones relate their visit to a book fair where they encounter a first edition of TARZAN, by Edgar Rice Burroughs for an astounding [amt]! They wonder how TARZAN can demand that kind of sum when, by their own standards, it is not necessarily considered great literature? As with most businesses, the Goldstones learn that the business of rare books is a BUSINESS. As such, demand drives prices and, as with antiques and collectibles, value is relative to the individual collector. <br />The fervor behind this story and the common penchant for booklore displayed by the Goldstones' is contagious. This story provides an education to the reader and a behind-the-scenes view of many unheard-of books (at least to this reader) considered classic and collectible. Their story offers biblophiles/biblomaniacs an insight into the world of rare books and a lesson in the business of books. It is easy to see that they earned their way into the world of rare books while being gracious enough to share it with the reader. USED AND RARE is a strange combination of education, love, travel and the chase for the perfect buy....at the right price of course!<br />I am immediately following this read with the sequel, SLIGHTLY CHIPPED, and have already ordered the third book in the series, WARMLY INSCRIBED. Anyone hooked on books should read USED AND RARE.	2002-01-01

Michael Gambino is the grandson of Carlo Gambino, the infamous head of the Gambino Family during their &quot;glory&quot; years. More recently, most will know the current head of the Gambino Family, the jailed and cancer-stricken John Gotti.<br />Michael Gambino followed the only footsteps available to him. As mentioned, his grandfather, Carlo Gambino ruled the Five Families of New York for decades and his father, Vito was a career gangster. Michael was well on his way to upholding this family tradition when he found the end of the trail for most gangsters...prison.<br />The Honored Society dipicts the &quot;fictional&quot; escapades of one Michael D'Angelo. Gambino informs the reader at the beginning of the book, &quot;The persons, places, situations, and crimes in this work are true to their background and circumstances. They are not, however, real. Characters are based upon composites of many of the people I have known. The experiences of these characters are based upon reality, barroom boasting, and my own overactive imagination. Many of the names, crimes, places, and circumstances have been changed to protect the guilty and innocent alike.&quot; That as it may be, you, the reader, can make your own assessment if this isn't the ostensible autobiography of Mr. Gambino. <br />To give you a flavor of the type of detail to expect....In the beginning of the book, Michael &quot;D'Angelo&quot; douses two pimps with gasoline and sets them on fire for severely beating a few of his friends. Michael watched them as they burned. As a result of that event, Michael's father tagged him with the nickname, Mike &quot;the Match.&quot; The Honored Society tells of Michael's adventures in the Family business in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and Colombia. As expected and mentioned, this book depicts an incredible level of violence. In a recent interview, Gambino said, &quot;It's kind of accurate. I extracted everything I have been through, and found a way to put it into an entertaining, fiction form. Without causing problems.&quot;<br />Quite expectedly, Gambino finds prison any number of times. However, he indicates that prison life changed him, at least his last stint. Gambino spent 23 hours a day locked up alone at the federal maximum security penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, just down the aisle from John Gotti. In the book's introduction, Gambino says, &quot;I have been arrested for murder, kidnapping, extortion, gambling, money laundering, robbery, running a house of prostitution, bribery, impersonating a federal agent, counterfeiting, burglary, bid-rigging, bookmaking, interstate wire fraud, possession of guns, running a chop shop, tax evasion, and drug trafficking.&quot; But he was convicted, he says, for &quot;a lot of tax evasion.&quot;<br />All-in-all, an outstanding expose on the mafia life and details of the &quot;transactions&quot; from within. A good read.	2001-12-22

Like many reviewers, I saw the movie &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; well prior to buying and reading the book. I have viewed this movie a number of times now and still find it as inspirational and moving as the first viewing. Now, after reading the book, this story has to be one of the most meaningful and inspirational stories I've ever read.<br />Jamal Wallace is a 16-year-old South Bronx African-American kid introduced to the reader as a &quot;regular&quot; teenager, loving basketball and loathing school. As incredibly talented as Jamal is with a basketball, his literary gifts approach genius. However, not wanting to be seen as a freak, Jamal hides his intellectual side from his friends and teachers.<br />Close to the neighborhood courts, Jamal and his friends observe regular visits by a well-dressed man driving a BMW to the man in the upstairs apartment who has not been seen by the public in years. This (the well-dressed man and a BMW) are rarities in the South Bronx. Jamal's friends indicate that this mystery man is a &quot;murderer&quot; or a some sort of ghost. On a dare from his friends, Jamal climbs in the mystery man's window only to be scared out of the apartment when surprised by the mystery man. In his haste to make his escape, Jamal drops his backpack which contains his writing notebooks along with his school work. Two days later, his backpack is tossed out the apartment window at Jamal's feet. When Jamal opens the backpack, he finds his writing notebooks are still there but have edited by the man in the apartment. After confronting and apologizing to the old man, Jamal soon learns he is the reclusive legendary novelist William Forrester, a man who only wrote one novel but which received the Pulitzer Prize. <br />After striking up a strange friendship (inasmuch as strange can be defined as a frienship between a 16 year old African-American and a 70 year old anglo Scot), Forrester agrees to teach and mentor Jamal in his writing aspirations. Concurrent with his new friendship, Jamal is recruited for an academic and basketball scholarship to a snobby, WASP-based Manhattan prepratory school. Encouraged by Forrester and his mother, Jamal decides to leave his friends behind for the potential advantages of the prep school. <br />Soon after arriving, Jamal meets Claire, the daughter of an extremely powerful businessman who also happens to be the chairman of the board at the prep school. Jamal runs afoul of a writing/literary instructor (a failed writer known to Forrester) who acuses him (Jamal) of plagarism. Jamal is ostracized by Claire and most of his new friends even though he is not guilty. In reality, Jamal is honoring a promise he made to Forrester. This story ignites at this point and is best experienced by the viewer or reader. <br />This &quot;novel&quot; is a rewrite of the original screenplay by Mike Rich and therefore, is not an original novel. Ellison follows the storyline true to the screenplay albeit with few explanations/expansions providing the reader with some insight not seen on the screen. The most important expansion provided by Ellison is the actual text of the &quot;story&quot; read by Forrester during the writing contest hosted by the prep school. In the movie, the viewer was only provided with bits and pieces of the story. This is actually the prelude to the climax. <br />The novel is realtively sparse in peripheral prose. This is evidenced by the fact that the novel is less than 200 pages while the movie is 2.5 hours. In other words, although Ellison did provide a few spectacular gems (see above), he did not massage the storyline enough to provide the reader with the necessary visual images typically accorded a story of this stature.<br />This is an inspirational and motivational story. As an aspiring writer, this story is touching, emotional and caring. While the book lacks a bit of defferential detail, the storyline is brilliant. Watch the movie or read the book...you'll not be disappointed.	2001-12-21
US	52631726	RVUOD85K7VFDB	0316693235	147933002	Violets Are Blue ~ Detective Alex Cross Series	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Solid but not of Patterson ilk.	Many times when authors use a character ad infinitum in a series of books, the plots become old and tainted. Cussler continues to use Dirk Pitt, Ludlum (to a lesser degree) capitalizes on Jason Bourne, and Patterson, of course, uses Alex Cross. In Patterson's case, he wrote two books in between the latest Cross novels (Diary for Nicholas and 1st to Die) so perhaps the reader would benefit from a fresh perspective. Yes and no.<br />(If you haven't read &quot;Roses are Red&quot; and intend to do so, I suggest you stop reading the reviews for &quot;Violets are Blue.&quot; You'll thank me later.) In the latest iteration of Alex Cross' life, we find Alex whisked off to California to investigate some very bizarre, vampire-like murders. The bodies of two joggers were found in Golden Gate Park....hung by their feet and drained of blood via bites. Vampire bites? Alex's FBI friend(?), Kyle Craig calls Alex and asks him to join the investigation team. Upon arriving in San Francisco, Alex finds a pleasant surprise in Detective Jamilla Hughes. Alex and Jamilla run the traps on the few leads available. However, even as they are investigating the Park murders, several other murders occur in California and now, in Las Vegas. It becomes quite obvious that the murderers are on the move and several steps ahead of Alex. Concurrent with his murder investigation, Alex receives continual cell phone calls from the Mastermind (Alex's nemesis from &quot;Roses are Red.&quot;) Ultimately, Alex heads back to D.C. dejected as to his lack of progress in this highly unusual and complex case.<br />As the parasitic vampires move from the West coast to the East coast, Alex is plunged into the seemingly paranormal world of vampiric norms. Alex learns much more about the tilted netherworld of vampiric cults, teeth sharpening and yes, the consumption of human blood. Alex continues to follow the trail of the murderers crisscrossing the East coast to New Orleans and finally back to California. All the while, Alex is haunted by the Mastermind. <br />The vampiric portion of this book climaxes for the reader in Alex's last trek to California. The storyline relating to the vampire-like murders is very unusual and off-beat thereby making it less than expected. If Patterson had developed this storyline a bit more and left the Mastermind for a succeeding book, I believe that &quot;Violets are Blue&quot; would have been an excellent book. However, with the ever-present Mastermind hanging over each chapter, the reader isn't allowed to focus on the vampire plot. This is a shame as I felt the vampire plot was so peculiar (out of the ordinary), it was engrossing. <br />Finally, the Mastermind. I enjoyed &quot;Roses are Red&quot; thoroughly with the exception of Alex's &quot;Frasier-like&quot; love life. However, at the end of &quot;Roses,&quot; the identity of the Mastermind is revealed. Inasmuch as &quot;Violets&quot; shares of dual plot of vampiric murders and the eternal search for the Mastermind, the latter portion becomes somewhat rote as the reader already knows the Mastermind. If Patterson knew he was going to write a continuing sequel (which was a given based on the ending of &quot;Roses&quot;), why did he reveal the identity of the Mastermind? Knowing the identity of the Mastermind was almost a nuisance in this book.<br />Patterson is a very gifted and creative author. However, &quot;Roses&quot; and &quot;Violets&quot; could have been blockbusters if Patterson had stepped back from the writing and looked upon his current and successive plots from the point-of-view of the reader. Oh and, by the way, Patterson has very obviously left the reader hanging for the next installment of the Cross saga with the following, final sentence of the book, &quot;But that's another story, for another time.&quot; Yes, I'll read it but I hope that Mr. Patterson will read a few of these reviews prior to penning it.	2001-12-16

(...)<br />Fish! is a parable about a middle manager, Mary Jane Ramirez, charged with the responsibility of improving a department dubbed the \\"Toxic Energy Dump\\" by upper management. This department is a \\"back room\\" operation wherein most of the employees feel underappreciated, overworked, and underpaid. Sound familiar? After experiencing the incredible lack of motivation and character for a few weeks, Mary Jane is at her wits end. Then, one day at lunch, she stumbles upon the Pike Place Fish Market. She meets Lonnie, a common fishmonger who exudes a love and passion for his job, his co-workers and his company. As she continues to stare in amazement, ALL of the fishmongers exhibit this seemingly joyous behavior. This, quite obviously, is very foreign to Mary Jane particularly coming from someone who handles fish all day!<br />Mary Jane begins picking Lonnie's brain and psyche as to why he elicts such a positive fervor for his job. Over a period of time, Lonnie lays out the four principles associated with the success and enthusiasm at Pike Place Fish Market. They are very simple principles, one that anyone or any company can model and utilize. Here's the one poignant fact about this \\"parable,\\" Pike Place Fish Market is anything but fictional. It exists in Seattle and thrives in much the way as described in this \\"work of fiction.\\" Consequently, any \\"doubting Thomas'\\" will be surprised to learn that these principles, in one form or another, are actually practiced and displayed...in REAL life!<br />Do not be mistaken, this is not the \\"end all\\" to literary works of motivation. However, if one will truly attempt to uncover and discover the meaning behind the principles presented, one should find a morsel of wisdom. If not, what have you lost? (Some money) and an hour of your time. Not much to invest in something that could provide introspective motivation.	2001-12-16

I must admit, I've never been a great fan of Sci-Fi. Not a Trekkie, Star Wars was good but not great, but I was impressed with the &quot;Ender&quot; series from Orson Scott Card. With disclosures out of the way, I decided to read Tolkien for their classical value. I had never read The Hobbit or the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; (LoR) series growing up but with all the hype associated with the movie and few well placed recommendations, I opted to give it a lash. I'm thrilled I did. This is truly a novel of great breadth blending action, drama and romance. Don't be fooled into the believing the classical classification of sci-fi.<br />In researching the history behind the books, I found LoR described as one of the best works of fiction by a multitude of reviewers while many went as far as to describe it as the book of the century. This reviewer can only describe LoR as a rapturously exciting adventure through the &quot;World of Middle-Earth.&quot; The story's foundation is built around the incessant battle of Good verus Evil but is much, much more than a match of wits. The lore associated with the characters brings to life classical heroic romance.<br />The first book in the trilogy, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; picks up some decades after &quot;Hobbit&quot; left off and begins in much the same style: something of a children's tale. This tale is set in the Shire, the home of the hobbits. Frodo, the hero of our story, moves away from The Shire with his companions, Pippin, Merry and Sam thus marking the beginning of his journey through Middle-Earth. Its at this point (yes, this early in the multi-booked tome) that Tolkien brings us the sense and presence of danger which becomes ubiquitous throughout the tale. This, somehow, transforms the storyline from one of children's tale to serious drama (action and adventure)...it grasps the reader.<br />As mentioned, the plot of LOR centers on the ever-present theme found in many of our great novels: good vs. evil. Concurrent with this theme, the reader will join Frodo on his quest to destroy the One Ring to prevent it from being returned to the Dark Lord Sauron of Mordor who, with the Ring, would have unlimited power.<br />The idea of hope, strength and perserverance is wonderfully illustrated in LoR. Even in the most desperate circumstances, when surrounded by chaos and destruction, the characters never give up hope of surviving. This indeed is Tolkien's grasp on the reader. You actually want to &quot;help&quot; the characters in their battle against evil. This can only be described as inspiring.<br />While complex to the point of intimidation, the reader is rewarded for his perserverance in traveling with the members of the Fellowship through the final page of this classical piece of history.<br />This particular version of LOR is a four volume, boxed set containings &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; and the LOR series, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King.&quot; Alan Lee adds masterful maps and illustrations intertwined throughout.<br />What a treat!

Moreover, if you're looking for a relatively easy read, Patterson's standard layout makes all his books very readable (I read this 400 page hardback in about 5 hours). This does not detract from the storyline rather, it actually enhances it, particularly if one is looking for a relaxing, enjoyable read. Patterson understands this concept and brings it to the reader with each offering.<br />My rating of this book is probably closer to three and one-half stars but nevertheless, Patterson created some unnecessary issues within this book. &quot;Roses are Red&quot; begins with a bank robbery and the senseless, sickening murders of the bank manager's family. As with any bank robbery, the FBI enters the picture; in this case, in the form of Kyle Craig and Betsey Cavalierre. Craig has a long-standing relationship with Alex Cross and decides to bring Alex in on this bizarre case for his psychological background and keen investigative skills.<br />Within days of the original crime, another bank robbery and more senseless murders. With this event, the &quot;Mastermind&quot; is introduced to Alex and the FBI. Alex begins his quest to outwit and catch the Mastermind, the ostensible brains behind the heinous crimes committed. However, the Mastermind is never directly involved in the commission of the crime and as such, is always one step ahead of Alex. In this Patterson installment, Alex's sidekick takes the form of FBI agent Betsey Cavalierre instead of the loveable giant John Sampson. A departure from the standard Alex Cross story.<br />This story winds its way through many twists and turns with Alex and Betsey doggedly searching for clues to the mystery and identity of the Mastermind. As their case wanes, the Mastermind becomes bolder in his activities, and more brutal. And, as they get closer to potentially solving the mystery behind the Mastermind, the danger becomes quite close and very personal to both Alex andBetsey. (I won't go much further with the storyline as any potential reader deserves the right to reach their own conclusions.)<br />As previously mentioned, Patterson has created another outstanding plot. However, like so many loveable characters, there always seems to be a flaw that is, at best, troubling to the reader. In Alex's case, its his love life. Patterson seemingly creates a new love interest for Alex with each new offering (as one reviewer pointed out, Alex Cross is no James Bond...inasmuch as James Patterson is no Ian Fleming...actually, better and worse). In this case, its Betsey Cavalierre. While you love Alex for his tenaciousness and intelligence, Patterson has given him a &quot;Frasier-like&quot; (the television show 'Frasier') penchant for losing at love. It gets old very quickly. Also in this installment, Alex also has a close call with his daughter, Jannie. She begins having grand mal seizures as a result of a brain tumor that eventually must be removed. <br />All of this &quot;filler&quot; is designed to make Alex more real, a character with strengths, weaknesses, and real emotions. OK, I get it. However, at times in this novel and a few others, Patterson tends to drone on about the peripheral &quot;real&quot; issues as opposed to developing the storyline further. This causes some denegration to the overall story.<br />Patterson is a talented novelist with a very keen sense for a solid storyline. Stick with with it, James! Leave the filler for other authors and continue concentrating on the developing the plot. All that said, I'm in the process of reading the serial follow-up to this book, &quot;Violets are Blue.&quot; Can't give up on Patterson. In the end, he still holds my interest.<br />In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend this book. Just try to overlook the off-tanget fluff.	2001-12-10

From a purely practical standpoint, Mr. Downs has done it right in that he establishes his intellectual base (earning a Ph.D) prior to &quot;coaching&quot; others (as an author/consultant). His background as a psychologist is the conceptual foundation of this book however, his experience in the business world makes this book germane to anyone in the business world.<br />Mr. Downs posits that fear is the hurdle to achieving success and describes for the reader the concept of fear...&quot;a generalized, ambiguous feeling of impending demise (or doom).&quot; Many, if not most, are in touch with this statement and the corresponding emotion. After all, fear (along with greed) is the great motivator. Mr. Downs describes the path to freedom of fear as &quot;Trust your talents. Follow your passion. Silence the fear.&quot; This forms the basis for Mr. Downs' argument that fear chokes the executive from realizing his/her potential. <br />In the first two chapters, Mr. Downs identifies the barriers to creative and intellectual success as well as providing the reader with a good explanation and understanding of the clinical and practical sides of fear. At the end of the second chapter, the reader is presented with a &quot;Fear Susceptibility Inventory,&quot; a survey that assists the reader in identifying &quot;potential&quot; areas of fear. After taking and grading the survey, the reader is presented with seven separate fears, discussed in detail in the ensuing chapters:<br />Fear of Inadequacy<BR>Fear of Rejection<BR>Fear of Scarcity<BR>Fear of Reality<BR>Fear of the Unknown<BR>Fear of Authority<BR>Fear of Aging<br />While there exist many other fears or peripheral subsets, these seven fears compose the limited universe of emotional angst faced by most executives at one point or another. Identifying, understanding and perservering against the incredible dark side of fear is Mr. Downs' objective in these chapters. He does an excellent job of explaining these fears, provides practical application and examples, and plausible solutions to each. Mr. Downs speaks to the reader, not above the reader as so many psychologists can. While this is not a cure-all or end-all book on the subject, its message is poignant.<br />My only gripe: the last 100 pages of this book could have been consolidated dramatically. This does not suggest substantial degradation to the message or content. However, one wonders if Mr. Downs was attempting to provide the reader with more theory than necessary. This is the only reason I've given this book 4 stars instead of 5 stars. <br />This book provides motivation and insight into the daily rigors facing the executive. If one applies these principles and suggestions, I can't help but think that, at the very least, one will find the daily problems more understandable and solvable. Mr. Downs suggests (and I agree) that if one can push through their fear and identify their true passion(s), life becomes more productive and enjoyable. A nice combination to strive for.	2001-12-03

In Theodore Roosevelt, he had an easy subject. Teddy Roosevelt was such an enigmatic character that most writers would have had an easy time of penning this biography. Morris, however, has done it quite well. Mr. Roosevelt fit the mold of history-maker as though he was destined for it. Quite simply, he was born to it. This book is the follow-up to the very solid &quot;The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,&quot; a book following Mr. Roosevelt's early years as he takes the Presidency as a result of William McKinley's assassination.<br />This book, &quot;Theodore Rex,&quot; (the moniker given to Mr. Roosevelt by Henry James) chronicles Mr. Roosevelt's nearly two terms in the office of the President. &quot;Rex&quot; reflects all of Mr. Roosevelt's profiled characteristics and acts, the good and the bad. It should be pointed out that during his term(s) in office, Mr. Roosevelt had significantly all politic circles (bipartisan) wrapped around his finger (something that only Reagan has approached since that time). That said and refreshingly pointed out by Morris, Mr. Roosevelt was literally vilified by many citizens (refreshing in that Morris presents all sides of this story). <br />Although Mr. Roosevelt had many incredible achievements, the one that I found the the most surprising was his Nobel Peace Prize for being a major contributor to bringing an end to the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. A very unlikely award for a U.S. President. <br />&quot;Theodore Rex&quot; does a relatively good job of fairly depicting the good and the bad of Mr. Roosevelt's seven and one-half years in office...a very honest biography. A truly great man, a truly solid biography. You'll not be sorry you invested in this tome.	2001-11-29

Kudos!	Siva Vaidyanathan had translated a sometimes incredibly misunderstood concept/subject into a reasonably understandable story. And, even more incredibly, it was written by a non-attorney (Siva is a professor at the U. of Wisconsin, School of Information Studies). \\"Copyrights and Copywrongs\\" covers the history and bastardization of American copyright law. Siva attempts to make relatively simple suggestions for fixing our complex, arcane system of protecting intellectual property rights. <br />Siva begins his \\"story\\" recounting in incredibly understandable terms, the history of the copyright ranging from the framing of the U.S. Constitution, the rights afforded musicians (recently challenged by the likes of ...) and of course, literary and digital works. Siva does not concentrate on the theoretical nature of this quagmire rather, he examines the issues as it relates to current issues and events making the content interesting and readable. He argues, very persuasively, that the current copyright laws in their punitive and restrictive form y hinder creativity and free expression. Further, he compellingly argues that the original intent of the laws were designed for flexible application to maintain cultural balance. <br />The issues framed in this book encompass the very future of creativity vital to industry, commerce, and free expression. A very enjoyable read even given the somewhat difficult nature of the subject matter.	2001-11-22

In literary circles, Stephen Hawking is either revered for his brilliance or denounced for his inability to reach the common man (this is no different than the cross borne by any physicist). &quot;The Universe in a Nutshell&quot; has something for both camps, a very solid offering describing scientific breakthroughs of our mysterious universe and incredible illustrations providing the reader with a picture for the mind's eye. Those with a background in physics will find this enjoyable while those lacking any background in this arcane science will find it breathtakingly informative (that is a promise).<br />As one of the preeminent scientists and thinkers alive, Dr. Hawking has presented this current work with the wit and candor that most of his contemporaries know him for. Moreover, the content of this offering is explained and articulated with the utmost clarity and lucidity. Dr. Hawking takes on the Theory of Everything in &quot;The Universe in a Nutshell.&quot; He provides us a view and explanation of many of our mysteries including Black holes, M-theory, P-branes, Superstrings, Quantum mechanics, general relativity and much more. Sound daunting? It can be however, Dr. Hawking provides us neophytes a view into the scientific world not seen before by discussing each of these theories/mysteries in simple intellectual terms comparing and contrasting the theoretical perspective to evidential matter. While Dr. Hawking's exuberance shines through, the incredible four-color illustrations clarify the theories presented. <br />For those wishing to understand OR gain an understanding of the universe including its many theories and mysteries, this book is a must read.	2001-11-22

Its a one-hour read. However, don't undertake this task while your brain is relaxing. Those that don't take something away from this book are either unfocused or require that a book meet the &quot;weight test&quot; to measure up. Don't allow yourself to be fooled.<br />Sure, this book's &quot;story&quot; is about 4 rodents, a maze and their quest for cheese. But the concept is much, much deeper. Personally and professionally, the concept rings true. Those looking for the easy path, the &quot;tried-and-true&quot; path, the concrete path, will never reach new heights. The book's parable leads the reader through the maze that is life, again, your personal or professional life.<br />I'll not go any further with the concept or the story as I believe each reader should experience the book and decide unilaterally. A warning: be prepared to THINK and focus on the concept. You'll not be disappointed. <br />I'm buying the calendar for each one of my employees in the same fashion that I bought a copy of the book for each of them.	2001-11-21

This reader has read each and every one of Mr. Ludlum's 24 novels including the most recent, &quot;The Sigma Protocol.&quot; Mr. Ludlum was THE master of intrigue and proved it time and again with each offering. I cannot image the literary world without this icon but I will always have incredibly fond memories. Your passing is one of sadness yet your life was one of greatness. <br />THE SIGMA PROTOCOL<br />Ben Hartman, international financier and heir to the throne of Hartman Capital Management, is in Zurich for a ski vacation when all hell breaks loose. His old friend(?), Jimmy Cavanaugh, unexpectedly shows up as Ben is leaving his hotel with a silenced pistol and begins attempting to end Ben's life. Although narrowly escaping death, Ben begins to ponder why him, why here, where his twin brother Peter suspiciously died in a small plane accident? As Ben begins his investigation, he finds that his brother Peter had been investigating a very strange cabal named Sigma. As Ben gets deeper into his quest, he realizes that Peter's &quot;death&quot; is anything but an accident and that the unknown force monikered Sigma is set on Ben joining his brother's fate.<br />Meanwhile, DOJ agent Anna Navarro is curiously assigned to locate the whereabouts of several old men on a list begrudgingly supplied by superspook Alan Bartlett. The connection between these men, while seemingly unrelated, comes from a CIA file dating back to the 1940s, code word Sigma. As she begins her search for these aged men, she finds that each subject has mysteriously died just before she can reach them. Those remaining alive on the list begins to wane but Anna smells a rat. Just as she begins to put together a case that each of these men have been murdered, many dramatic attempts are made on her life. <br />In only a fashion brought to life by Mr. Ludlum, Ben and Anna are thrust together and soon come to the common conclusion that they seek the same answer: Who and what is Sigma and why does this shrouded group want them dead? Determined to find the answers and coming to the obvious conclusion that their only hope is to work together, they criscross Europe to uncover the secrets behind Sigma. They soon find that Sigma's tentacles are threaded through all levels of industry and law enforcement placing the odds overwhelming against them. These secrets threaten everything Ben and Anna hold sacred, everything they knew of history, their friends and, incredibly enough, their families. These secrets actually hold the fate of world and it's future.<br />This storyline is incredibly intertwined, complex and thoroughly delightful as only Robert Ludlum can weave. This book is a page-turner and kept this reader on the edge of his seat throughout. For all mystery/intrigue fans, this is a can't miss book. For all Robert Ludlum fans, this is a throwback to the &quot;Bourne,&quot; &quot;Matarese,&quot; and &quot;Parsifal&quot; days. In other words, Ludlumites MUST have this book.<br />Ludlum fans, while saddened by his passing, should take heart in the fact that Mr. Ludlum's publisher will publish at least two more significantly complete novels Mr. Ludlum had been working on prior to his death.	2001-11-20

He's a fun read and great storyteller. And, while I'm partial to Spenser and Hawk, Jesse Stone (the hero of &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; and the other &quot;Paradise&quot; novels) is a hero you can love. On to the story....<br />In typical Parker fashion, the story begins with a dead body. A young teenage girl has turned up in a lake in Paradise. She's been shot and Jesse smells a skunk. Jesse begins his investigation which actually takes many twists and turns. This was quite enjoyable and worthy of Parker's storytelling lore. (Parker does however continue the yarn regarding Jesse's dysfunctional relationship with Jenn. This is old but certainly makes Jesse seem human (as opposed to superhuman).) However, Jesse does strike up an interesting relationship with a high school principal after meeting her during his investigation.<br />The story is fluid and vintage Parker....right up to the last 50 pages. Had this book been longer by 100 - 125 pages, I think it would have had the ending it deserved. In its current form, it appears that Parker got tired of the story and cut it short. It was anything but fluid. A disappointment for a true Parker fan.<br />Long story short....Parker has seen much better efforts.	2001-11-03

In this case, O'Reilly establishes the parameters of a &quot;zone&quot; where lies, spin, and misdirection are unallowed (&quot;lies are rejected and equivocations are mocked&quot;). .... Professionally however, I applaud his candor and efforts to seek the truth. ....)<br />Some of the more interesting pieces in this book involve Dr. Laura (a great piece if you're not a Dr. Laura fan), P. Diddy (the artist formerly known as Sean Combs and Puff Daddy on why the name changes and the current state of rap music), and former First Lady and current NY Senator Hillary Clinton (I'll save the subject matter for your read!). O'Reilly cuts these folks very little slack but, by so doing, creates a poignant picture of why, how, who, etc. <br />&quot;The No-Spin Zone&quot; truly zaps the spin associated with so many political or celebrity interviews. Barbara Walters this ain't. But if you're looking for a straight-up, no-holds-barred look into many of our current public figures, their thoughts and why they do the things they do, read this book. Again, you have to admire O'Reilly for achieving what so many can't....a true insight into the questions we want answered.	2001-10-24

So many &quot;self-help&quot; books are pure rhetorical tripe. Common sense, good manners, and sensible actions regurgitated. In &quot;The Four Agreements,&quot; Ruiz does not break new ground but the simplistic and thoughtful nature of his message make this book a winner. <br />Let's face it, experience and iteration (practice) will propel one toward their stated goals with certainty. To point, the four agreements, as simple as they may be, are tantamount to successful achievement of personal and/or professional goals:<br />1) Be impeccable with your word - keep your word or your reputation will fail.<BR>2) Don't take anything personally - tough act to muster at times but possible (besides, its good for the soul).<BR>3) Don't make assumptions - those who assume will lose the benefit of fact and learning; check your facts--learn what is necessary.<BR>4) Always do your best - this is the most simplistic of the agreements but one that we all have a tendency, at one time or another, to allow to lapse; if you decide to undertake something, make it YOURS!<br />So many people who read books such as this or &quot;Who Moved My Cheese&quot; (self-help genre) attempt to pick apart the conceptual nature of the message whether simple or complex. Certainly, many books of this ilk are not worth the paper they're written on but when you find a message that speaks to your intellectual being as well as your soul, you'd better listen. Riuz's message is poignant; follow these simple rules and create your own happiness. <br />This isn't a &quot;cure-all&quot; book. If you read it without concurrent introspection, then you've done nothing more than read a short book espousing basic vitues. However, if one reads this book with an open mind and the congruous search for excellence, this will be a truly powerful experience. If one does not, then one has lost the message behind the words. Don't read the WORDS, absorb the MESSAGE!<br />Jump in, both feet. You'll not be sorry.	2001-10-18

The author of &quot;The Perfect Storm,&quot; Sebastian Junger once again brings the reader into a story even though the content is based on a series of fact-based articles. This book is poignant and timely for a variety of reasons.<br />&quot;Fire,&quot; the title story, highlights the efforts of firefighters in their battle against the raging forest fires in the Western U.S. But, this book covers much, much more. Each &quot;essay&quot; is a tribute to people confronting life-threatening situations in an unabashed manner. Junger's reports and ability to delve into the core of each situation is equally unabashed and brilliant. <br />Other than shining the light on the dynamic spirit of firefighters, perhaps the most interesting and timely profile is that of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the anti-Taliban guerrilla leader. Prior to the heinous September 11 attacks on the U.S., Massoud was assasinated presumably by bin Laden-led terrorists. With great flair for detail and an uncanny ability to bring a character to life, Junger describes the courage and stature of Massoud, the &quot;Lion of Panjshir.&quot; A phrase that sticks in my mind from this essay and one highlighting Junger's talent for storytelling, he describes Massoud in the following fashion--&quot;He was not tall, but he stood as if he were.&quot;<br />While each essay is compelling and exciting (for non-fiction-type depiction), there is something slightly disjointed about a mutliple essay-based book. This is the ONLY reason this book did not receive 5 stars in my opinion. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable read.	2001-10-17

Speaking of timely...what an understatement. With two confirmed cases of Anthrax (as of 10/10/01) staring the U.S. in the face (whether associated with terrorist activities remains to be seen), this book could not have been shoved to the forefront at a more necessary time.<br />In this expose, Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg, and William Broad, writers with The New York Times, report to an ostensibly unaware public the truth regarding biological weapons. They make an extremely compelling case that biological warfare, not conventional conflicts, could become the U.S.'s worst nightmare and the everyday U.S. citizen's worst fear. &quot;Germs'&quot; foundation is based on an incredible number of interviews with bio-scientists and other knowledgable officials thereby creating a very real basis for belief.<br />During the 1950s and 1960s, Miller reports that the U.S. promoted and maintained an active biological program. Led by the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in the 1970s, the U.S. reportedly discontinued its biological production and maintenance program. (While program discontinuation made this reader feel proud, it also became haunting given the potential consequences of NOT having the ability to defense such biological threats.) The reemergence of the biological threat came in the form of the Gulf War and Saddam Hussein. While the U.S. may have crippled Iraq's immediate biological abilities during the Gulf War, Saddam may have reconstituted the program over the succeeding decade and THAT may be the crux of the immediate threat to the U.S. <br />Every American should read this book. It was very well written and researched. I cannot commend the authors enough.<br />Educate yourself and understand the threat.	2001-10-11

First, Dave Halberstam is a very talented storyteller. Even as non-fiction has a tendency to drone, Halberstam makes reading non-fiction fun, brings it to life. Previously, Halberstam was honored with the Pulitzer Prize for reporting the events as they transpired in Vietnam. He then went on to a national best-seller with &quot;The Best and the Brightest,&quot; an expose of sorts on the men behind the Vietnam War along with an insightful analysis of their plans, schemes and decisions. &quot;War in a Time of Peace&quot; follows in the footsteps of these achievements.<br />In &quot;War in a Time of Peace,&quot; Halberstam examines U.S. foreign policy in the post-cold war world. The book throws the reader into the Gulf War time frame and jumps into the incessant yet poignant problems facing the U.S. in a slew of third world countries. In only the way Halberstam can, he relates the story behind the media proclamations showing how events in the Balkans, Somalia, and Haiti reflect American politics and foreign policy. <br />An incredibly timely and piercing book, &quot;War in a Time of Peace&quot; features important and insightful thumbnail sketches of key political figures including Bill Clinton, George H. Bush, Dick Cheney and many others. Unlike other authors however, Halberstam leads us into the interaction between the powers, the brains behind the power and ostensibly, the true skinny behind the scenes. <br />A must read in my opinion.	2001-10-03

Perhaps I'm boring but Parker hit a grand slam with me when creating the dynamic duo of Spenser and Hawk. While we still have the terrific tandem here, Parker throws a few curves at the reader in Valediction.<br />Right out of the box, you know this is going to be a nerve-wracking story. In the opening scene, Spenser has just come from Susan's Ph.D. grad ceremony when she drops the atomic bomb that she is moving to San Francisco for a new job. This sets the stage for Spenser's moods throughout this book. <br />Spenser's friend, Paul, asks him to look into a wherein Paul's boss, Tommy Banks, believes that his girlfriend has been kidnapped and brainwashed by a religous cult. While we learn that Banks may not be the most honest citizen, it really doesn't matter. For if you are in Spenser's way in this novel, you are in grave danger. <br />On a lighter note, Spenser meets, goes out and seduces the woman he has flirted with across the street via flirtatious smiles from their respective office windows. This relationship takes on a more serious tone but, can it last? Will Susan return to Spenser? <br />Parker takes you down a variety of paths in this one. Different for Parker but a good read.	2001-09-28

The main thrust of this novel is the access potential terrorists have in our country. <br />Demille is masterful in his depiction of Asad Khalil, our book's resident terrorist and antagonist. Like we've seen the past few weeks, Khalil believes in the martyrdom of his actions and the ultimate reward from Allah. The premise: absolute obstruction of the U.S. <br />Our hero is John Corey. You grow to love Corey, a somewhat faulted yet tough and funny. Corey plays an incredibly wonderful hero in this book. <br />I hesitate to say much more given recent events.

Although the past few weeks have heightened the fear of other terrorists ..., Hussein was/is the great threat. \\"Revenge\\" is the follow-up to Mylroie's co-authored effort, \\"Saddam Hussein and the Crisis in the Gulf.\\"  <br />In \\"Revenge,\\" Mylroie directly and indirectly asserts that Hussein had a hand in 1993 WTC bombing. This was, in part, due to the fact that he never \\"mentally\\" recovered from The Gulf War, that he was embarassed. (Perhaps the U.S.'s greatest folly in The Gulf War...not finishing the job.) The author's premise was that the ultimate plan would be to take both towers down like dominoes. It didn't happen but that didn't stop Hussein. Mylroie gives us additional theories of terror involving Hussein however, the \\"main idea\\" here is the WTC bombing. <br />Ramzi Yousef is Mylroie's villian. An Iraqi agent, Yousef is considered the figurehead in this terrorist act. While the political aspect of this act is germane to Mylroie's theories, I didn't necessarily agree with the spin. Mylroie asserts that Clinton's poor management of the issues and circumstances associated with the bombing led to the rise of a great western misconception regarding terrorism (specifically that based in the Middle East). This misconception centered around the theory that the majority of the terroism being carried out today is sponsored by splinter groups and individuals. In other words, state sponsorship of terrorism had all but ceased. While this has been proven false to a certain degree, it cannot be qualified as a general statement of fact.<br />The author tells a good story albeit fact-based. This is a very enjoyable read and quite timely.	2001-09-28

Suffice it to say that I'll be buying other Parker novels. <br />Gail Connor is a single mom and a civil attorney trying to make ends meet. Anthony Quintana is a high profile, well-to-do criminal defense attorney. While their interaction would lead the reader to believe anything but the fact they're in love, they certainly are. Gail is guilted by an old family friend into taking on the death penalty appeal warned by all, including Anthony, to be futile. Regardless these admonishments and excepting the fact that she's never handled a criminal matter, much less a death penalty appeal, Gail takes the case. She is representing Kenny Ray Clark who is scheduled to die in just a few short weeks. Gail is overmatched but a quick learner. To boot, she has the best teacher around in Anthony. Anthony agrees to help but only under the strict parameters of Gail's Trade Wind emotions. And, Anthony has a dark side--one that pays off.<br />This story has all the essential elements: a bad guy, family squabbles, misdirection, deceit, murder, sex, reality, and...well, you get the idea. Parker has created an outstanding legal thriller.<br />The only reason this novel didn't receive 5 stars was due to the level of legal jargon. While not overwhelming, I believe it detracted from the story somewhat.	2001-09-24

I read this in less than two hours (it is a novella) and upon completing this simple story, I had a incredibly overwhelming satisfaction toward the ferocity of the human spirit. Yes, this book is all story but the main idea is all spirit. Those that can't see the incredible battle within are not READING the story, just the words. As a simple by-product, this book led directly to Ernest Hemingway's receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954. <br />This story features three main characters: the old man (Santiago), a young boy (Manolin), and the human spirit. Santiago takes on the once-in-a-lifetime catch of a prize marlin which is described and portrayed in a manner to draw out the challenge facing each individual, both physically and emotionally. Santiago hasn't had a catch in 84 days. On day 85, he decides that, no matter what, he'll not return with a catch. Indeed, that was his fate. Santiago experiences physical pain, emotional pain, spiritual pain, and the pain of being alone with the elements. Yet, he continues on, creating hope where there is none. Before this story reaches it conclusion, getting right with life, Santiago decides it is he or the marlin.<br />This story is incredible. It deserves(d) all the critical acclaim received. Once again, those who didn't find this story touching their soul didn't read the story.	2001-09-24

Our main character, Patrick Wallingford, a sometimes likable yet roving lech, is a news reporter. During one of his trips abroad, he has his hand &quot;removed&quot; in a bizzare accident (I'll leave the details for you to read). Like all unfortunate events, the news media swarms the story and replays the hideously grotesque video incessantly thereby ensuring that Patrick would have anything but a normal life. <br />To trip wires of the medical ethicists, Wallingford makes plans to have a new hand transplanted. Our transplant specialist is, of course, the best transplant surgeon available if not a bit peculiar with this obsessive behavior toward dog poop and his live-in housekeeper. Our surgeon is prepared to perform the procedure but the widow of the donor throws a curve to Wallingford. Meet Doris Clausen. Prior to consenting to the transplant donorship, Doris demands to meet Patrick and further insists on visitation rights of the hand subsequent to the surgery. Upon meeting Doris, Patrick is lovestruck forever.<br />The story then weaves its way through many trials and tribulations, encounters, brief affairs and Green Bay football before its absolutely &quot;feel-good&quot; ending.<br />I read many of the other reviews of this book and frankly, couldn't disagree more with those naysayers.

Angelo is a boy when we first meet him and then a man who has earned his respect yet, as most mobsters earning their bones, he has few redeeming character qualities. In my opinion, Lorenzo Carrcaterra does a fabulous job of introducing Angelo to the reader and presents him in a wide open backdrop allowing the reader to get inside Angelo's head. You'll meet Pudge, Angelo's best friend from childhood and into their geriatric years; Angus McQueen (Angelo's mentor), and Ida the Goose. This threesome provides the setting for Angelo's rise to &quot;Don&quot; status and also provides for enthralling dialogue and action.<br />Carcaterra's first journey into the mob scene is a success. He has created a fine cast of characters and, unlike many books of this ilk, we actually get to know the main character. Frankly, as I completed the book, I found myself liking Angelo. <br />Well worth the read.	2001-09-17

Well, Pitt does it again in Cussler's latest incarnation, &quot;Valhalla Rising.&quot;<br />When the latest and greatest new cruise liner is mysteriously engulfed in a raging inferno, Pitt's survey ship, which just happens to be within a binocular's view, rushes to the cruise ship's setting the stage for a daring rescue of the nearly 2,000 passengers on board. During his heroic efforts, Pitt runs across Kelly Egan, a predictable beauty who has just lost her father under suspicious circumstances when abandoning the ship. Kelly's father is a famous and ingenious scientist/engineer whose revolutionary and unprecendented engines powered the ship prior to meeting her fate. Upon hearing Kelly's tale, Pitt believes someone with nefarious intentions has set this fire and disabled the fire alarms and sprinkler system. This was a death trap.<br />Pitt and his ever-present sidekick Al Giordino, begin their investigation into the cause of the cruise ship's demise. Unbeknownst to them, their journey will take them to the bottom of the ocean in a luxury submarine, the skies over New York in a firefight with a vintage aircraft, into the pages of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; and down the Halls of Congress. Truly a whirlwind track. To top off this thriller, Cussler makes a cameo appearance himself. <br />All-in-all, a great read and thrilling adventure. Oh, by the way, I won't tell you why this book is named &quot;Valhalla Rising&quot; but rest assured, this is another twist you're sure to enjoy.	2001-09-17

The majority of the advice presented by Mr. Lemberg is valuable and viable. However, Mr. Lemberg indicates that these changes will move one through the journey &quot;faster&quot; than the changes one faces. In my opinion, this is placing the cart before the horse. Understanding the processes of traveling the path is the lesson within the journey. If one has walked the path but not learned its lessons, one will surely fail when faced with the potentially daunting issues that lie in everyday life and business. Consequently, Mr. Lemberg has put his theories AHEAD of the lessons. This is not the logical path, thus 4 stars instead of 5. <br />That said, Mr. Lemberg has many, many wonderful thoughts, theories, concepts and exercises. I believe wholeheartedly that most individuals can benefit from this book. Regardless whether one uses Mr. Lemberg's advice to the letter or molds a concept to fit a current issue, this book presents new ideas and solutions to old and ever-present problems.	2001-09-08
US	52631726	R1P1AGR81WWJVE	0399144463	305463091	Who Moved My Cheese?: An Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life	Books	5	7	11	N	N	A Thinker's Book	My advice is simple: Try this book. Its a one-hour read. However, don't undertake this task while your brain is relaxing. Those that don't take something away from this book are either unfocused or require that a book meet the &quot;weight test&quot; to measure up. Don't allow yourself to be fooled.<br />Sure, this book's &quot;story&quot; is about 4 rodents, a maze and their quest for cheese. But the concept is much, much deeper. Personally and professionally, the concept rings true. Those looking for the easy path, the &quot;tried-and-true&quot; path, the concrete path, will never reach new heights. The book's parable leads the reader through the maze that is life, again, your personal or professional life.<br />I'll not go any further with the concept or the story as I believe each reader should experience the book and decide unilaterally. A warning: be prepared to THINK and focus on the concept. You'll not be disappointed.	2001-09-08

The Earps are like the Musketeers (you know, &quot;all for one and one for all&quot;). The type of loyalty presented between the brothers will leave you nothing short of incredulous. Enough about that....just an interesting theme within. The book.....if you've seen &quot;Tombstone&quot; and &quot;Wyatt Earp,&quot; you know the storyline. Regardless that, READ THE BOOK. Parker, in his storytelling genius, brings the reader inside Wyatt's head (sometimes a strange place to be). You learn of the stoicism, fearlessness, total control and, you'll even see the romantic in Wyatt. To read this book is to understand Wyatt. For that, Parker has done fans of Westerns a favor. Lets face it, Kirk Russell and Kevin Costner is not what I have in mind when I think of Wyatt Earp (although both actors played excellent parts). This book only received 4 stars if for no other reason than the public, including the reading public, has been inundated with Wyatt and his brothers. Parker does a wonderful job with the story as he does with most of his offerings. Forget those that will tell you that its JUST a regurgitation of the movie. They didn't READ the book. They just scanned it. READ it, you'll KNOW Wyatt Earp.	2001-08-28

Once you've read it, you'll be looking for others such as The Quiet Game, 24 Hours, and Mortal Fear (for what its worth, Mortal Fear is my favorite Iles of all time although Dead Sleep is destined for greatness). Iles blends just enough toughness and tenderness in Jordan Glass and the absolute partner for her, John Kaiser. Jordan twists her way through a quagmire of clues that will take the reader in many different directions. However, don't be fooled: if you've figured this one out before the end, your nickname should be Sherlock. Watch Jordan! She'll lead you down the path of righteousness.<br />If you don't buy and read this book, its your loss.	2001-08-21

While it may not be in the EXACT same genre and class as Bone Collector, it does have its merits. Besides, if for no other reason, you should read it to see how far your imagination will take you. Deaver weaves his story through the Internet and our anti-hero is Wyatt Gillette (definitely a movie name!). Now, Wyatt has to have a bit of bad boy aura or he wouldn't qualify as a consummate codeslinger. Regardless your take on Gillette, you love him by the end of the book. A definite yarn of good v. evil. Gillette battles the psychotic Phate, a man who is only equaled in skill by Gillette yet Phate has an advantage over Gillette. He doesn't have to wear handcuffs and shackles. Huh, you say? Check it out; well worth the read. Phate will have you looking over your shoulder. Don't be scared. Keep repeating...&quot;Its only a book!&quot;	2001-08-21

If you like heady suspense along with an outstanding plot, you've got to read this book. Iles is fabulous at hooking the reader quickly and keeping him entrenched throughout the book. This,  along with his previous 5 star &quot;Mortal Fear&quot;, are counted among  my favorite reads. My only wish is that Iles could publish his magic as  quickly as Stephen King!!!!	1999-09-08

Within the first 15 pages of this book, Baldacci spins the tale and continues the heart palpitations through the end. This is the second Baldacci novel I have read and I am thoroughly hooked!
