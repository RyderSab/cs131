The book is loaded with as much humor as it is romance, and the drama is first rate. Rather than portraying the lives of the beautiful people we are treated to the people who lead exciting lives yet have the same insecurities and needs as everyone.  This novel is a true delight to read.  It is an in-depth look at people's daily lives and the secrets we all have and decisions we all make.  This novel is a keeper that you will want to read again.

I could not put the book down once I started to skim the first chapter. The romance was simply lovely and the drama quite real. Up until the end you are not sure what the resolve will be.<br /><br />The secondary characters are so intriguing that I would enjoy reading a sequel to this story involving both Susan and Me-Lin as most especially Adele.<br /><br />From the publisher's website - Sister Katherine Flynn is an Irish nun, sent by her order to work in the remote Australian countryside of New South Wales.  Katherine is a prideful woman who originally joined her order to escape the shame of being left at the altar.  She had found herself getting married only because society dictated it for a young woman her age, and she was not exactly heartbroken when it didn?t take place.  Yet, her mother could not be consoled and talked of nothing except the disgrace that she had brought to the Flynn name.  So, she finds great relief in escaping the cold Victorian Ireland of 1872.<br /><br />Catriona Pelham is a member of the reasonably affluent farming gentry within the district.  Her relationship with the hardworking townspeople and its farmers is one of genuine and mutual respect.  The town?s wealthy, however, have ostracized her due to her unorthodox ways and refusal to conform to society?s expectations of a woman of the 1870?s.  Catriona finds comfort in the friendship of the townspeople and farmers, but at night she pines for the lover she lost long ago?her governess, Adele Cooper.<br /><br />As a bond between Katherine and Catriona develops and so the journey begins for these two strong-willed women.  For Katherine it is a journey of self-discovery and of what life holds outside the cloistered walls of the convent.  For Catriona it is bittersweet, as feelings she has kept hidden for years resurface in her growing interest in Katherine.	2005-10-02

It was one of the best written scenes in the novel.<br /><br />I like how the author doesn't shy away from giving the characters major insecurities that aren't resolved after one heart to heart chat.  It's also refreshing to have the characters express their feelings and say what is on their minds.  Nothing is more frustrating as a reader when the characters refuse to clear the air with an adult conversation.<br /><br />The love is wonderfully erotic while the romance is endearing and the interaction with the children playful.

Although not necessary I would recommend reading the authors' novel 'Love in the Balance' first as it has some of the same secondary characters, and one of the main characters also makes an appearance. I was totally intrigued by Sage Bristo in the opening chapters. I loved her relationship with her sister. I really didn't think she had a chance with Deanne. They had many walls to overcome, within themselves and with each other. It was great getting to know Deanne and what motivated her. Sage for all her charm makes a couple mistakes when romancing Deanne and you are never sure they will make a couple. Don't miss this story and hang on to it to read again, I did, and got a deeper understanding of both characters the second read.<br /><br />Book Description<br />What was it about Sage Bristo that drew women to her? Maybe it was the tall, toned body and androgynous good looks. Perhaps they liked her confidence -- her movements and manner so sure and decisive. Or was it the air of mystery, the temptation of a challenge to unravel? Sage couldn't explain the attraction, but she had certainly benefited from it, at least physically. Women would do anything for her. But never the woman she needed the most -- the one woman who could lead her through the realm of desire, to the one thing she desires most. . .In this Revised Author's Edition of Legacy of Love, Marianne K. Martin tells us the complete story of Sage Bristo and the mystery that surrounds her.	2005-08-14

The fun part was watching both characters grow and reach fulfillment by opening themselves to trust in each other and themselves.  I won't be loaning this book out - I'll be reading this again.  Enjoy!	2005-08-09

Much more than a romance it's the story of many different people with a variety of issues that by the end of the novel you end up knowing as you do your own friends.  Believe the other reviews, this should be on your must read list.  I've read it twice now and enjoyed it even more the second time.  Perfect for a lazy afternoon or evening.<br /><br />Book Description<br /><br />After inheriting an old plantation house from an aunt she didn't know existed, Dhari Weston heads 800 miles south to see the place and meets intriguing Dr. Erin Hughes, a local history professor with a passion for old houses. Dhari's life is complicated enough without meeting such an attractive and intelligent woman: Her mother needs her, her father relies on her and her girlfriend worries her. But when Erin finds old letters and a diary, Dhari knows she can't leave until she finds out the truth .	2005-08-09

But it's much more than romance.  The center of the novel are two people with deeply troubled pasts who struggle to find their way through life.  I love seeing how they approach life, sometimes one step forward and two steps back.  It's also the stories of their friends and family.  From chapter to chapter you never know what direction the story will take Marika, Rhiannon, or Lee  but they always stay in character.  This is one long, utterly satisfying, novel.  The author is always totally focused on the core relationship and their relationships with their friends. Several of the chapters are truly brilliant - you will not put this book down until you finish.  And the bonus is that many of the characters were in the author's previous novel 'Coming Home' however I would not call this a sequel. On top of all this is criminal intrigue with a very satisfying ending.<br /><br />book description - Emotional wounds aren't always apparent, and those that haunt Marika and Rhiannon are deep and lasting. On the surface, Marika appears to be a wealthy, successful lawyer, while Rhiannon is a reclusive, maladjusted loner; but Marika, in her own way, is as damaged as the younger Rhiannon. When circumstances throw them together one summer, they begin to reach out, each finding unexpected strengths in the other. However, even as inner demons are gradually vanquished and old hurts begin to heal, evil in human form reappears. The cruelly enigmatic Cass has used and controlled Marika in the past, and aims to do so again. Can Marika find it within herself to break free? Can she save her young friend from Cass' malevolent web? With the support of remarkable friends, the pair fights to break free-of their crippling pasts and the woman who will own them, or kill them.	2005-08-01

One moment I am laughing out loud and a chapter later I am shaking my head in amazement at the depth of emotion the author gives us as experienced by the lead characters.

The reviewer didn't enjoy this novel as it wasn't epic historical fiction. I was confused, the reviewer was looking for historical fiction from an author known for hip modern romances with a good dose of humor.  You wouldn't compare James Mitchner to Noel Coward, both are fantastic in their own genre.	2005-08-01

You wish you could join them in their weekend barbecues. They have so much fun and are full of life.  I picked the book up and didn't put it down until I finished - it was a day well spent!

Ms. Kallmaker is one of the top writers in the romance genre and this is one of her best (and my personal favorite - so far).  I don't have any phobia's with age differences between lovers so that might be a hang up that the reviewer couldn't deal with?<br /><br />The pace of the book is excellent, each action builds on the one prior and the reader feels totally connected to the characters.  I highly recommend this book<br /><br />The lead character `Rayann' is totally independent and an original. She stands up for herself and does her best (with success) to be self-sufficient after being left out in the cold (this is the beginning of the book).<br /><br />The character study and prose is so wonderful I would often re-read a page for the sheer enjoyment.  I was fully engaged with the two main characters as well as the equally fleshed out supporting characters.<br /><br />I didn't find Rayann overtly lesbian, of course when you are a lesbian you will go to a lesbian bar - lol.  Any woman would be more inclined to visit a woman's center rather than the YMCA.  As to the comment about `having a problem with men outright' I can tell the reviewer did not finish the novel as there was a wonderful example in the book of a super nice guy.<br /><br />I won't give the plot away but suffice it to say that `love' is the entire premise of the novel.  Rayann has eyes for only one woman, and is with only two women in the novel, both whom she cares for in different ways.<br /><br />Perhaps the reviewer also didn't note that the book is told from Rayanne's point of view for a purpose -it is deliberately one-side - I found it utterly charming.<br /><br />from the publisher's web site - Twenty-nine-year-old Rayann Germaine, betrayed by her lover, flees in grief and rage. She meets rare book dealer Louisa Thatcher, a woman many years her senior, who offers shelter and work... and soon, passion, and a loving place in her life.

The main characters are thoroughly fleshed out. By the end of the novel I felt I knew them as well as I do my family. Part of the focus is on the world of martial arts which holds little apeal to me, however the author made even those scenes interesting and appealing.

Subsequent fires make life hot as they rush against time to unravel the mystery surrounding the death of Sam Madison, all the while dealing with their newfound attraction.

From the very first page the reader is captivated and wants to know more about the characters. We meet Ryan O'Flaherty and Jamie Evans, juniors at the University of California at Berkeley. Oh My Goodness, this was fun reading. The two main characters are completely endearing (I just can't get enough of them). The author explores them thoroughly so that the reader gets to know them well. This is a wonderful story.<br /><br />This novel is a substantial read to be savoured. Happy Sigh...I Love this series.<br /><br />Excellent writing, perfectly paced plot, lovable characters. I was riveted to every page and didn't want to put the book down.  I always hold off opening this author's novels until first thing Saturday morning so I can read as much as possible in the next 48 hours.<br /><br />Along with the great plot the humor is laugh out loud funny.

What no one can know is that the course, The Psychology of the Lesbian Experience, will propel Jamie onto a journey of self-awareness and realization.<br />For the required fieldwork, Jamie is paired with the darkly beautiful Ryan O'Flaherty--a boldly \\"out\\" and sexually adventurous lesbian. This somewhat unlikely pair slowly, and sometimes painfully become aware that what they feel for each other is more than just friendship.<br />The temptation to live life on her own terms is great, but so are the costs, as Jamie struggles to break out of her establishment-fashioned, pre-ordained mold. If she can summon the courage, however, she might find out that love, and life, have so much more to offer than she had ever dreamed.e temptation to live life on her own terms is great, but so are the costs, as Jamie struggles to break out of her establishment-fashioned, pre-ordained mold.
