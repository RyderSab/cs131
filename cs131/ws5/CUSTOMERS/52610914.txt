First the good news: the recipes and photos are every bit as wonderful as those in Sara Foster's first cookbook. That is very high praise, as you know. <br /> <br />We've had the book less than a week and we've made the Icebox Pickles, the Chipotle Mustard Sauce, the Chicken Salad with Apples, Grapes, And Spicy Pecans, and the Dark Chocolate Souffl Cake.  It's all so, so good! <br /> <br />Sara Foster, I am your devoted fan and I will probably buy any cookbook you write.  However, the layout on this one is terrible: small print and not much white space.  For example, the \\"WHAT TO SERVE WHEN\\" section should have been separated from the intro paragraph, instead of just changing ink color.  The binding should allow the page to lie flat - after all, it's a cookbook. The book is just plain hard to read and use. <br /> <br />That said, I'm already waiting for the next Sara Foster cookbook! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-06

The pear/raisin/ginger muffin is fabulous.  The cookies are fabulous, no equal - 5 stars.<br />Now the bad and the ugly: I get that it's frustrating that nimcompoops ask for fat-free baked goods; keep it to yourselves. I have no quibble with the philosophy and practice of cream and butter (I'd probably be drummed out of America's Dairyland if I did). I do quibble with the fact that this is stated again and again and again and again.  It begins to feel condescending already!  For example, most of us do actually know that a muffin is a kind of cake and that there's half the calories of a scone in a half-scone and that a chocolate macaroon is rich. - minus 1 star	2003-10-13

But most recipe are easily halved.<br />I've had this book three days.  Already I have made the N.Y. crumb cake (actually, a half recipe and our family of four is still eating it three days later), the chilequiles with tomatillo salsa (again, half recipe), and the roasted red potato salad (half recipe).  This afternoon, my 10 year-old made the Blondies (full recipe).  We now have Blondies for a platoon.<br />With all that food, good thing all results have been wonderful. <br />Buy this book.	2003-01-12

I am not in the restaurant or food business, nor am I a personal friend of the author's.<br />  Undoubtedly, Zuni Caf&eacute; is a wonderful restaurant experience.  But, if like me, you are a home cook with limited access to quail, various imported Italian goodies, and glasswort, etc., etc., etc., forget this book. Much of it is just too dang precious.<br />  Precious also is the language.  Like the author, I have spent significant time in France and speak French at near-native level.  However, I really question her use of French (sometimes Italian)when English will do  - example:  &quot;restes&quot; for leftovers. The impression is one of insecurity or a need to elevate herself and her recipes.<br />  The book is a giant step backwards to someone like Narcisse Chamberlain - eurocentric cooking for Americans.	2002-12-25

There isn't one surprise here (unless you mistakenly thought the restaurant cooked completely from scratch).<br />The &quot;theme&quot; of the restaurant and these recipes is Sunday dinner at your Southern grandmother's. Well, I happen to have had a grandmother from Greenville, South Carolina.  She would have felt very much at home with this food and the manners espoused by the Inn's owners. So I vouch for the excellence of the way the Blue Willow has carried out this theme.<br />The Sterns: I own several of the Sterns' books. I especially enjoy their WAY OUT WEST and ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BAD TASTE. The Sterns are both funny and astute. <br />While reading through the BLUE WILLOW INN COOKBOOK, I had a picture of the Sterns just trying to hold themselves back from taking easy potshots.  From time to time, the temptation must have been too much and they crossed the line into unkind. It is the only time I have seen them do that.<br />All in all, keep your money.	2002-10-10

SimpsonAlso  Won in Court	Legal victory is not always a guarantee of truth. Sure, David going up against Goliath to win millions of dollars makes for a great read. In this case, however, it simply didn't happen that way. Schawlow, Townes, Maiman, et al. have contributed many, many other things to the field (in fact, Schawlow's Nobel was for research primarily in the 1970's).  What has Gould done?  He spent his time villifying and stealing credit (Schawlow and Townes never received royalty payments on the laser because of contractual obligations to Bell Labs). The best way to read this book is as a biased work of fiction.	2001-02-05
