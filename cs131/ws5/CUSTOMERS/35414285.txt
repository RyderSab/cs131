I am a search engine marketer and have generally worked on the \\"free\\" or optimization side of search engine marketing for the past year. I also have read at least a dozen books or ebooks on this subject.<br />Generally I think the return on the optimization side is much greater than on the paid side, but if you are a savy marketer using paid search engine marketing can bring rapid distributions and returns. I personally have been amazed at some of the high profile, high frequency search words which have few competitors on the market (even today.)<br />There is much to know about search engine marketing, and much of the info that is out there on either side (paid or optimization) is chuck full of misinformation. This book is new and kept general enough (covering a rapidly changing environment) to where there is not a bunch of misinformation. She even predicted that paid inclusion would go to a PPC model right before Yahoo! put the new system in place.<br />If you have enough money to be participating in paid search then this book could help you save some of it.	2004-03-16

He brings up many good points about how marketing is shifting from product, placement, price, and promotion to participation, personalizaton, peer to peer communication and predictive modeling.<br />To me a good marketing book emulates its own story. In my opinion this book fails to do that. I also failed to envision many of the business ideas as I work independantly. If you are into the technical side of marketing this is a great book for you. I tend to be more interested in books like those written by Seth Godin and Malcolm Gladwell though. If you view Seth Godin as fluffery than this is probably going to be a great book for you. Their writing styles are polar opposites in my eyes.	2003-12-24

My biggest problem with it is that it sites its sources too frequently which makes for long unclear runon sentencens much like the one you are reading right now.<br />Other than that, this book is great. If you change your diet or learn another way to elevate your serotonin levels naturally you may save yourself some of the despair caused by popular SSRIs such as Zoloft or Paxil. Search the web for feedback on either drug and you will see what I mean.<br />How much is your sanity worth? $4 - probably a little more!	2003-11-11

People were knowingly hurting others for the sake of greed and image.<br />What disgusted me the most was not necissarily the gangsters or crime that this era created, but more to think of the stark injustices which parallel this world to that, every waking morning.<br />A powerful book that will make you ask just a few more questions and become just a little more informed.	2003-11-06

It is a rather famous poem which describes simply how life can transcend beyond what is seen by the general media or the judgemental prying eyes.<br />He did much good for his country only to eventually be told he was not good enough to be the best. Not knowing how to accept defeat he eventually went after victory in another way.<br />I have a little blood in my mouth to this day. The navy had to destroy their work records of me before they could discharge me. I am now a success despite them trying to ruin my life.<br />I see where he is coming from. If I would have made a few turns I chose not to make, I could have shared his fate.<br />Thank you to those who tried to destroy me and started to build me into the person I am today. To many sorry reenlistments and years of missery...cheers.	2003-11-06

If you are new to blogs this book would be excellent. If you already have some experience with blogs this book might be alright, but keep in mind it starts off assuming no knowledge of the internet.<br />Also, his genius thing is just a joke...he does not appear full of himself or take himself too seriously.

When markets were created, the term market was a place where we came together to exchange goods and services, along with the stories of the grand ventures. Market was a place, not a verb. In the market people exchanged stories with their goods.<br />The industrial complex built up. Things became automated. Supply and demand seperated. <br />The web was created.

Nick does his best by speaking to &quot;you&quot; much the same way as your copy should. <br />He also does a great job of showing you examples of good vs bad in the different writing attributes he teaches througout the book. The only part of the book which looses focus in my eyes is when he speaks of why the copywriter needs to write the copy. I felt like he was making a sales pitch for all copywriters. Other than that it was one of the best internet books I have read.	2003-10-28

As search engines get more advanced, they will be more able to emulate the end user.<br />This book is simple and straightforward. Another positive part of this book is that it overlaps other issues a little to help you understand that there is more to a website than search engine marketing.<br />This book does not cover in detail some of the wordarounds for dynamic website configurations.

He also talks of the times where media blatently refused to print the news they know, and those times it was used to manipulate the mindless masses.<br />He also does a good job of drawing parallels between the two war on terrorism bits that are twenty years apart.
