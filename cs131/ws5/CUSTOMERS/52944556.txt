US	52944556	R11GV7LPZLR3U5	2915239339	111646628	British Armour in Normandy	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Excellent!	`British Tanks in Normandy' is an excellent guide for anyone interested in armor operations, armor in Normandy, as well as for model builders and miniature wargamers. <br /> <br />The book contains brief (~5 page) histories on each of British units that saw action in Normandy, brief details (~5 pages per vehicle) on all of the British armor vehicles and finally chapters on operations and the life of British tankers. <br /> <br />The text information is well done and includes some solid technical details and varient histories. What makes the book unique and so useful is the fantastic selection of photographs and illustrations. Most of the photos in the book were ones I had never seen before and include excellent detail of the various tanks and their variants. Each photo also has a detailed caption. A number of color illustrations on vehicle markings and unit badges are also provided. In addition, many of the vehicles get full color 5-view illustrations. <br /> <br />The book was originally written in French and this is a British translation. As a result there are a few odd sentences and a few terms that my confuse an American reader but these issues are very minor. <br /> <br />If you have any interest in the topic this book (and all of the books in the series) is a must get.	2005-10-02

I recently used the 'Battle Zone Normandy: Villers-Bocage' book on a trip to Normandy and Villers-Bocage. The book provides an excellent (relatively brief) history of the battle as well as three very well done 'guided tours' of the battlefield (with directions and maps). Excellent maps and photos (both current and historic) are provided throughout. <br /> <br />The tours in the book proved very useful, interesting, educational and accurate. The town and surrounding area have almost no markings about the battle so the book proved invaluable. The model of Villers-Bocage in the town hall, mentioned in the book, is well worth seeing but it is tucked away in a dark corner of the hall and if not for the book I would have never found it. <br /> <br />The historical accounts in the book are well done and provide interesting details of the battle as one follows the tours. My wife even enjoyed reading them as we went. <br /> <br />My only quibble with the book (as well as others in the series) is that one must flip back and forth throughout the book as one is taking a tour to refer to the various maps and photos. But this is but a minor annoyance. Also not mentioned in the book is an estimated time for each tour. Plan at least approximately two hours for each tour. The book is also focused on visitors from the UK and lacks similar tips for American visitors. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-09-30

This book is an excellent account of one man's experience with WW2 submarine operations. The author made it to the level of executive officer on a sub by the end of the war (and went on to even more interesting events as told in his other book \\"Surface at the Pole\\"). <br /> <br />The author writes clearly, interestingly, and honestly. The author covers most of his patrols (of nine if I remember correctly) in detail and even some of his personal events while on shore. He covers everything from the horror of being depth charged to the boredom and tedium of patrol. <br /> <br />Overall the author provides an interesting and enlightening account of US Submarine operations and what it was like to serve on a US submarine in WW2.	2005-04-12

The writing is just repetitive, tiring, and full of fluff. If I had to read 'black ichor' one more time I was going to scream. The story is un-interesting and the characters not only shallow but also not likable. Granted the universe of WH40K is fiction but Green makes the world completely unbelievable in this story. <br /> <br />The one good thing about the book is Green does a nice job of describing both ground and space actions. Fans of BFG will find some interesting sections. <br /> <br />If you like WH40K go read Abnett's books.	2005-03-11

So if you really want to be surprised don't look at it until you get stuck. But having said that it is a great guide. Also it is in glorious full color. <br /> <br />The HL2 Guide is broken into five sections: <br /> <br />First is an overview of all the weapons in the game. Full color illustartions and good info. <br /> <br />The second is an overview of all the characters you will encounter. Again, full color illustrations and good info. <br /> <br />The third section is the real meat of the book and contains the walkthroughs of each mission. What makes this section so nice is that a great map of the level is provided, which is better than the ones they did for Doom3, and full color screen shots that take you step by step through each mission. In addition, great tips and other goodies are highlighted for each level. If you get stuck on a level this is the place to look. Also, it is a great read AFTER you finish a level to pick up some tips and maybe see a few things you might have missed. It also narrates the story so you can actually read through this section almost like a book. <br /> <br />The fourth section of the guide covers Counter-Strike. <br /> <br />Lastly the book includes all the cheat codes you could ever want. <br /> <br />Overall it is a very well done guide that will help you through a few tricky levels and has excellent production values.	2004-11-23
US	52944556	R2GCGQZ3CRQEFK	0895260204	507471508	Inside CentCom: The Unvarnished Truth About The Wars In Afghanistan And Iraq	Books	3	3	5	N	Y	Only half a book	The book is reasonably well written and would deserve four stars if not for the fact that it is only 150 pages long and, as a result, glosses over or avoids answering real questions (or even giving real meat to the events in general). It is an interesting account although only maybe a third to half of the book is new information over what Tommy Franks provides in his book. If you have not read Franks' American Solider I suggest reading it first then this book. <br /> <br />DeLong does present a few mistakes we made along with all the things that went right, but both he and Franks seem to avoid the real questions and both avoid going into any depth on the mistakes. Both admit they wanted, and expected, the Iraqi Army and police to remain in place post-war. Well they didn't. Why? Whose fault was it? Why did we have no plans in place if they didn't? How could we have better compensated for that loss? <br /> <br />DeLong also insists that we could not have used more troops in Iraq because the Kuwait front could not support them. Well knowing what we know now of the aftermath should we have not started the war before a second front was available? I don't think anyone has any doubt the military phase of the war was masterful but boh DeLong and Franks seem to want to pretend the post-war disaster has not happened. The military seemed very focused on defeating the Iraqi Army but it seems not much attention was then paid to the result of that objective, namely occupying and rebuilding the country afterwards. DeLong does address the post-war situation briefly and this is one of the huge disappointments with the length of the book. His experiences here would have been very interesting. He ends up working for a civilian company that has contracts to build an Iraqi military base. <br /> <br />Delong remarks he likes and admires Wolfowitz but then admits the Chalabi thing was useless. Well was that a bad decision? What were the results of that? What should have been done? <br /><br />I also found it interesting that both DeLong and Franks state that Richard Clarke was rather useless and `out of the loop.' Well if he was out of the loop then why was he out of the loop? Whose fault is that? Shouldn't he have been in the loop? Why did we have a terrorist Czar anyway then? Was that a position that was supposed to coordinate with the military? Was it Clarke's fault he was useless or was the position a joke? This is another example of not enough depth to help the reader make any real conclusions. <br /> <br />DeLong says that Bush's address on the aircraft carrier about the `end of major military operations' was his idea (and Franks). The fact was, in their minds, major combat was over and the `post' phase needed to start to get more allies helping. But he doesn't then detail what additional contributions or allies resulted. He makes a big deal about the large Coalition for Iraq, which was a completely separate group from the Afghan Coalition, but doesn't put their contributions in any light (besides the British). The fact is even with roughly 30 countries helping us I think no more than about 5,000 troops (not counting Britain) were sent. How much money was given? What other support was vital? The reader is in no better position to compare the Coalition from the first Gulf War to the current Coalition because of the lack of information presented by both DeLong and Franks. <br /> <br />DeLong does present some interesting facts about the interests of France, Germany, China, and Russia in Iraq before the war. Why did we allow Germany to build massive tunnels and bunkers for Iraq? Why did we allow China to attempt to put in a fiber optic network for Iraqi air defense? Again, not enough information is given. Obviously some mistakes were made somewhere in the current and/or previous administrations if these actions went unaddressed. <br /> <br />DeLong still says we will find WMD in Iraq. I hope so but at this point it seems a pretty dicey assertion. I also believe we have found no proof of the remote piloted vehicles with WMD spraying capability that DeLong highlights as a reason for war and a concern during the campaign. <br /> <br />DeLong does make a good case against the media coverage during the war but doesn't provide an alternative. This seems a good area for discussion that would help America. <br /> <br />Both DeLong and Franks speak very highly of George Tenet. Given the obvious intelligence issues that have come up something is missing here. Either Tenet was great and the organization failed, which would still be his responsibility, or the Bush administration did `bend' the facts, or Tenet was simply not a good Director even if he did work well with the military. Another mystery. <br /> <br />Overall it is a quick and interesting read but, like Franks' book, leaves one with more questions unanswered than answered. I'm afraid we'll need to wait for the historians to get those.	2004-11-15

Malleus isn't as good of a story as Xenos but still a very good read. If you have not read Xenos then definitely read that book first. Also if you are not already a fan of Warhammer 40,000 be prepared to slug through the first 50-100 pages as the book throws a lot of names and events at you that could be tough to deal with if you are not already familiar with the 40K universe. Overall a good, well written sci-fi yarn.	2004-11-08
US	52944556	R2PL8ZY7WIL2YI	0060731583	486983213	AMERICAN SOLDIER	Books	4	4	10	N	N	Overall very well done	American Soldier is a well written and straightforward story of a fighting soldier who has had a very interesting and varied career. The stories of Franks' early days in Vietnam are interesting and insightful. He has had a number of unique opportunities in his career and one can certainly see how he ended up at CENTCOM. He does a wonderful job of explaining how modern military forces operate (or should operate). Overall it is a very enjoyable and interesting read (more so than Powell and Schwarzkopf's works). <br /> <br />Now having said that the latter part of the book that covers Iraqi Freedom is perhaps the weakest part or at least somewhat odd. Franks does a great job of explaining his experience during this period but one is still left scratching one's head. Either Franks is politically naive (unlikely) or isn't quite giving the total story. For example, one initial concept for the war was called the 'unilateral' option that had just US and British forces involved (basically what we ended up doing) yet Franks describes that as the least preferable option but it morphs into the final plan. The metamorphosis just comes across as somewhat odd in the end knowing what we know now. Other similar contradictions crop up. For example he mentions during planning how important it was to keep the Iraqi Army intact and get it back to work. But we didn't. He does a reasonable job of explaining how things changed over the period but does so in a way that makes you think 'Huh, if A then how B?'. I feel I need to re-read the latter half to perhaps settle these things. For all of the analysis he does try to bring to the events he seems to leave out huge swaths of political, social, and even military reality for consideration. You are left thinking, 'Yeah but what about...' One can argue he is a general and policy, grand strategic policy, and world politics should be left to the politicians, and ultimately, judged by the historians. I was left simply scratching my head with morequestions unanswered than answered. <br /> <br />The very end of the book is almost a commercial for the Bush administration that will rub you in a  <br />way commensurate with your own preference in that area.	2004-10-22

I hadn't bought a guide in a long time and bought the Prima Doom 3 book. I liked the color in that book and thought it would be great for DoW but it has none.  <br /> <br />Anyway, the content of the book is typical. First it covers the four races in detail, then gives walkthroughs for the campaign missions and finally multiplayer tips. <br /> <br />I did not find the walkthroughs necessary at all but I suppose if you get stuck they might be helpful. <br /> <br />The portion that covers the four races is useful with tips and a nice overview of all the weapons, buildings, and options. One note though that some of the weapon icons are not quite correct (heavy bolter for a storm bolter, etc) but this isn't a real problem. This section has s few tidbits I didn't pick up in the game's manual. <br /> <br />Overall a solid book but nothing exceptional or particularly necessary.	2004-10-07

Now having said that I really enjoyed Xenos. It is very well written and could easily standalone as a good sci-fi book in its own right. Obviously 40K fans will get a bit more out of it. I've since bought the next book in the series and Abnett's latest. I'll echo some of the other reviews and agree the book could have been another 100 pages longer.	2004-10-07

The audio version has a fantastic narrator. The book itself is well written and a gripping story. If you want a 'you are there' tale of Marine combat in the Korean War (or just infantry combat in general) this book is for you. It pulls no punches and gives it to you straight as the author saw it. The story is very much a study of combat leadership and low-level infantry combat and does not dwell on the other larger aspects of the Korean War (either military or political).	2004-07-21

Thunder Run is destined to be a military classic equal to 'To Hell and Back', 'Ghost Soldiers', and 'Black Hawk Down.' The mission itself has all of the excitement and human drama such a story needs. In addition, the author does a fine job of writing and, unlike many other embeds and their stories, took the time to conduct over 100 interviews of the participants including even a few Iraqis. The result is a solid account of the events that many of us saw live on TV (and if you did see the coverage you'll be amazed at what you DIDN'T see).<br />The author was not embedded with the units involved but was at the Iraqi Airport when the first Thunder Run ended and was able to interview some of the participants soon thereafter. He then followed up with extensive interviews of the other participants in the following months. The author covers all of the events of the first and second Runs and does a fine job of intertwining the thoughts and actions of the major participants. This is very much a 'you are there' story.<br />A gripping read and a true testiment to not only the honor, courage, and professionalism of the U.S. armed forces but also to the Iraqis. This is a must read if you have any interest in military history or the Iraq War. It is also a significant account because the number of detailed works on armor operations at the tactical level are few and far between.	2004-06-28

WW2 aficionados may find this stage setting a bit general but Mr Nelson does a fine job with it and its inclusion will certainly help those not familiar with the period put the Raid in its proper context.<br />The book is very well written, entertaining, and is easily on par with Ambrose's best works.<br />One reviewer complained &quot;He was known as &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey to anyone else with just a modicum of knowledge of the major WWII players.&quot; This was odd I thought because not only does Mr Nelson cover this fact but also explains HOW Adm Halsey got the nickname.<br />If you have never read anything on the Raid before this is a great place to start. If you have read other works Mr Nelson's is so well done you will certainly find it an enjoyable read.	2004-05-25

It does a good job of giving one a sense of Kerry's childhood and a reasonably good account of his actions in Vietnam. The post-Vietnam details are a bit thinner though. Also missing is any analysis or comparision of Kerry's actions with any facts. Thus one is left with a very one-sided view of John Kerry but an interesting view nonetheless. The book is worth reading for some general background but a more authoritative biography will probably have to wait until after (and if) he gets elected.	2004-03-30

The author certainly saw his share of combat and deserves his due. Having said that though I must echo many of the sentiments of others expressed here that the author does not seem to realize that his thrill of looting, wandering off on his own, and perhaps outright goldbricking is not something of which to be proud. Perhaps those of us not there should not comment but I have read countless personal tales of soldiers in WW2 and this is the first one that left me less than impressed with the author. Perhaps Mr Blunt is just that, blunt and tells it like it was. I'll give him credit for that.	2004-03-08
US	52944556	R20BCDOMNGF9VU	0304362166	447910782	By Tank Into Normandy	Books	4	17	19	N	Y	A good tanker's tale	First off I should say this book probably deserves five stars just for its very existence. Tankers from WW2 do not seem to have written very much and any works are sorely needed. Perhaps the casualty rate for tankers was too high. Anyway, Mr Hills delivers a solid account of his time as a tank and scout platoon leader (Sherman and Stuart tanks) with the British Sherwood Rangers. Mr Hills saw considerable action from D-Day itself through to the end of war in Germany. Overall he does a fine job of describing his experiences.<br />What keeps the book form earning five stars is that, first of all, he skimps on the details of most of his actions as well as his equipment and day-to-day duties. Mr Hills had a real opportunity to inform the reader of what it was really like to be a tanker. Unfortunately he just does not go into enough detail. He doesn't even tell you what versions of the Sherman he was on (and every German gun is an 88mm). A couple of his battle accounts approach a fair level of detail but always end-up just shy of really letting you know what happened and he rarely makes you feel like you are reliving the action with him.<br />My second complaint is that Mr Hills is British and unfortunately, for readers not from the UK, writes like one. What I mean is that he uses lots of references to all things British that are simply lost on the non-British reader. Starting with his childhood school experiences right through to various pop-culture references he simply assumes the reader understands all things British. This is not a huge distraction from the book but does add to the somewhat distant feel too it (along with the semi-formal, British stiff-upper-lip thing). This tendency combined with the lack of overall detail makes for a less than stellar read and is certainly history's loss.<br />Overall Mr Hill does do a good job and the book is interesting and informative. The problem is simply that there are so few tankers' tales that it is a shame he did not take the book the extra mile.	2004-02-20

The book is significant by its mere existence. I know of very few books by American tankers. The book is well written and covers from his indoctrination through home coming and even his revisiting Belgium in later years.<br />Hartman was a M4 Sherman driver and tank commander (although he was initially given the choice of being a driver or a gunner). Unfortunately his details on his many combat actions are light. But he does give a few interesting glimpses into the life of a U.S. tanker.<br />-He was on the Sherman the whole time but he never details what variants along the way. One picture in the books shows him on a M4A3E8 at the end of the war. He does mention going from the 75mm Sherman to the 76mm during his Bulge actions. He also notes that his battalion got four Pershings (one per company) in April 1945, just before the end of the war. Because no one was familiar with them they were stuck in the back of the column. He said folks felt better knowing the limitations of the Sherman. Although, he does note they wish they had the Pershing during the Bulge fighting. Hartman comments on the great reliability of the Sherman throughout the book and notes the German tanks \\"lumbered along at a snail's pace compared to ours.\\"<br />-Tanker losses were really appalling. In nine months of combat the 11th Armored Div suffered 48.1% casualties during the war with 614 killed (out of about 12,000 men in the Div). His 41st Battalion suffered 68 killed (about 11%) and his Company B suffered 23 killed (about 20%). What is amazing is the high loss of officers and tank commanders. His company commander was killed within minutes of their first action and in the nine months I think they went through three or four COs (one at least was wounded and returned later). He only seems to comment on a couple of bad platoon leaders. He lost numerous tank commanders either directly or as they left to fill other vacancies. In the Forward of the book, Spencer Tucker states that the 3rd Armored Div suffered 580% casualties of its tanks (either destroyed or 'knocked-out') and that the U.S. lost 6,000 tanks in Europe during the war.<br />-Hartman comments on the poor performance of the 75mm gun and that they had to get rear shots on the German tanks. \\"The German gun had fired an armor-piercing projectile that entered the turret, killed all three men, and then exited the other side. We knew the German 88 was extremely powerful, but this was devastating to see. We were later able to measure the distance from which it had been fired-1,700 yards, almost a mile!\\" What is most notable though is the low number of actual tank vs tank actions (at least that he describes). What seemed to cause the most tank loses were panzershreck attacks (the author always says panzershreck or even bazooka but who knows if this was strictly true or if he did not differentiate among panzerfaust, etc.). Snipers also killed a number of his comrades.<br />-The author describes working very frequently with armored infantry troops and how often a couple troops would ride on the back deck of the tank to spot enemy infantry and AT units. He also talks about how `Art' (a call sign), the Piper Cub spotter plane, would fly overhead and call down artillery on enemy positions and even help give them driving directions through towns. Art also called in tactical air cover and Hartman comments on P-47s firing rockets at the enemy. He mentions at least a couple of occasions when the tankers would act as or support infantry clearing houses.	2004-01-11

Courtney was a Pfc with the Yankee Division (26th Infantry) in a 57mm gun platoon. Unfortunately the author does not go into too much detail on the various combat actions he was invloved in but there are a few tidbits I thought you might find interesting.<br />-The 57mm gun had removable gun shield extensions. He said most folks would take these off after awhile because the extra weight and having them bang around was annoying. They figured the thin metal wouldn'd help much against enemy fire anyway. Might be nice for some divirsity to have a few of your 57mm guns without shields.<br />-He talks a lot about the 'truck' that pulled the guns. He finally states it was a 1 1/4 ton truck. He never mentions half-tracks at all.<br />-Every enemy tank he mentions is a Tiger! I can't believe they all were so I wonder if this was just lack of detail on his part, foggy memory, or the old cliche that every American thought the German tank they were facing was a Tiger?!<br />-He notes the ineffectiveness of the 57mm gun against tanks and how they had to try and get side shots. They relied a lot on the TDs to do the real work. He was with the gun through the very end of the war. He talks about acting as infantry a lot with the guns left somewhere especially towards the end of the war.<br />-He mentions that the German AT guns were very well balanced and easy to move by just two guys. The 57mm gun he said was very unbalanced and very heavy and awkward to move even with four guys.	2004-01-11

He does a pretty good job with it. Like many of his Slammer's books it seems to be composed of novellas. In this case it almost seems like three separate short stories that he either wrote as one larger story or wove together after the fact. He even repeats things in the second 'chapter' that seems to assume you didn't read the first. Overall it is an interesting story if not particularly deep. The focus is definitely on the action and not the politics in this one. The ending was a tad cheesy. If you like the Slammers you'll like this one as well.	2003-02-03

It even has a short timeline. Some of the overprinting can be hard on the eyes and the amount of detail can be overwhelming but it is still very well done. Very useful if you are visitng the area or just want to hang it on your wall for show or for use as a reference while you read.	2002-07-28

If you are familiar with tank operations in previous wars, you'll be surprised by their use in Vietnam. Good coverage of AFV use as well. Highly recommended.	2001-07-03

With Erickson's insights there is plenty of balance in the book regarding German vs Russian bias. My only real complaint is that the later Russian offensives are given less coverage compared to the intial German attacks. Overall though if you are new to the Eastern Front or just want a quick overview as a refresher or just a good read you can't go wrong with this book.<br />While I have not seen the video series of the same name this book seems to be a companion to it with lots of quotes from the videos.	2001-02-17

First let me say that the author's writing style was somewhat annoying. He weaves together the tales of five lieutenants during the war. The tales are all great but he does a poor job of letting you know whose tale you a reading. It takes some extra effort to figure this out the first third of the book or so until you get to know the folks in the book well enough.<br />Now having said that, the book is an excellent and almost painfully honest look at what it is like to lead mean into battle. All of the fears of the unkown as well as deeds done are included here.<br />If you are going to be an officer in the military (or think you might like to be) or recently became one you need to read this book. You will appreciate the honest tales that let you know that your own feelings are not unique and what it truly takes to be a leader.	2001-02-12

Alan Carter has simply nailed the entire study guide concept. This book truly has it all, very well written, great index, excellent outlines, great sample questions, great labs, and even a &quot;beach side&quot; exam quizzer. Alan covers all the material very well and adds in his own excellent real world incite and experience. You won't find a better MCSE 2000 book than this one.	2000-09-27

This is the ONLY one of those that covered how to install and configure Certificate Services AND how to deploy  and install client certificates. This is rather important for a Web server.  The book is clear and concise and covers the major topics needed by most  IIS5 Administrators. It is a bit weak on true server security lock-down and  ASP but there are other books for that anyway.	2000-09-20
US	52944556	R3OQBANFKTQMFJ	0735709505	172307792	Inside Windows 2000 Professional	Books	3	15	15	N	N	Good for users, lousy for administrators	First, the book I have in front of me has the ISBN number, page count, and  back cover blurb as the book above, but mine is entitled simply 'Windows  2000 Professional' and the cover shows manhole covers not a highway. I  can't find it listed anywhere so I can only assume the publisher changed  something along the way as I did get mine almost as soon as it came out.  Perhaps the &quot;Inside&quot; moniker seemed more marketable. Certainly  the &quot;Inside&quot; addition only makes the book even more  mis-titled.<br />Anyway, the book is fine for newcomers to NT and folks moving  from Win98. It is horrid as a book for administrators for which the back  cover and intro claim it is intended. A perfect example is in Chapter 8,  Managing the Computer where the author writes, &quot;This chapter covers  the maintenance tasks that most power users consider important. It does not  discuss how to manage MS Windows 2000 Professional on networks, however,  which is a big job that's better left to [other books].&quot; The chapter  includes three pages on how to use Event Viewer (among other trivial  items).<br />Obviously any administrator with any knowledge of NT will find  little of use here. There are some good tips and tidbits scattered about  but they are not worth wading through all the hand holding for the casual  user or new NT user. The author would have served the IT community better  by simply putting those tidbits in a magazine article. There are too many  other good Win2K Pro books out there to bother with this one. It is too bad  because the author had a good concept and the book length was perfect but  the execution is for the new NT user, barely for the power user, and  certainly not for an administrator.	2000-09-06

Having always dug through Tech Net articles or the one or two chapters most books give to system policies and profiles (and don't even  get me started on the lousy Resource Kits) it was very refreshing to have  such a well done book on the subject.<br />The author covers Win NT4, Win 9x  and Win2K. He's documented all the exceptions and changes the Resource Kits  do not. Mr. Wilkins even manages to write in a style approachable to both  the new administrator as well as the seasoned one. If you are going to roll  out policies/profiles get this book.	2000-02-25
US	52944556	R12G6Z04STD377	156205810X	663559807	Designing Web Usability	Books	4	38	40	N	Y	Excellent Baseline Reference	Desigining Web Usability is, overall, an excellent book. I agree with one of the previous reviewers who stated that if you are a seasoned Web designer/developer there is not a ton of information here that is new. But  it is nice to have it all in one place and so lavishly presented. The  production value of this book is very high and is itself an example of  excellent information presentation (albeit in the print world).<br />The book  is especially good for those new to Web site design and usability. I have  seen all too often how graphic designers or especially marketing types and  executives new to the Web insist on designing a Web page THEY like instead  of one usable for the intended audience.<br />Overall you may not agree with  everything Dr. Nielsen says but if you take the basic principles to heart  your Web pages will be much better. A key principle is that just because a  page looks good does not mean it functions well. Dr. Nielsen will show you  how to do that.	2000-01-14
US	52944556	R15S7023G5TE9D	1562059467	621260225	Windows Nt Network Management: Reducing Total Cost of Ownership (The Landmark Series)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Maybe mistitled but a great book	Some may misconstrue the title of this book to mean network management in the sense of system administration or network traffic flow. This is certainly not the case as the sub-title indicates. It is a book that covers  some of what a traditional NT admin book would but is really much more. The  book is very much geard towards the network/IT/IS manager. The book is  filled with great bits on policies and procedures as well as how to get the  most out of your NT systems. If you are an experienced NT admin this book  will not have much that is new for you although, because it is so well  written, it may still be an interesting read (as it was for me). But the  new NT admin and, more importantly, the new manager, will find this a great  book on how to use NT efficiently and what non-technical issues come up in  the IT world. The book also has excellent references throughtout that point  out places to find more specific details.<br />For the experienced NT admin  'Windows NT Network Management' is just a good read but for the new manager  or someone coming over from other areas or systems it is an excellent  primer on NT and system management issues.	1999-12-16

If you have read, or re-read, Ender's Game recently you will certainly find Ender's Shadow enjoyable. If you have not, I do not think you will understand a lot of the  excitement this book offers.<br />Also, while Ender's Shadow certainly has its  own excitement it does not match that of the original.	1999-09-11
US	52944556	R2NX5S5DTCUTS0	0125531699	239883781	Linux Clearly Explained	Books	4	14	14	N	Y	Good for many but not so great for some	If there is such a thing as four stars with a big exception this book gets it. The first thing to understand with this book is that it has a VERY narrow scope and objective. Within that scope it succeeds rather well but  is still not exceptional.<br />The objective is to get a new user introduced  to Linux and up and running with it as a day-to-day workstation, NOT a  server. As a result, the focus is on GNOME and productivity applications.  Things like system administration and moderate to advanced  &quot;Unixisms&quot; are given only minimal attention. This is bad if you  are looking for this sort of thing and if so you should look at the many  other books out there. But if you are new to Linux and want to get it  installed and running for general PC use this book does a good job. This  book includes and is centered around Redhat Linux 6.0 and Corel's  WordPerfect 8.0. Users of other distributions will find little useful  information.<br />In the intro the author states &quot;LCE teaches the  concepts as well as the procedures of Linux usage. After you've read this  book, you'll posses the understanding that will enable you to make the most  use of GNOME.&quot; While some attention is given to the command prompt the  author focuses on doing as much as possible through the GNOME interface.  This is an admirable goal, and a unique one, but I did not feel quite  enough depth was given to LinuxConf or file management.<br />The author has a  somewhat odd (or certainly unusual) writing style. The book is written at a  much higher level than the typical &quot;Linux in a minute&quot; books,  which is refreshing. But this also leads to oddities such as in-text  citations that give it a textbook feel, which just seems misplaced in this  case (the author has a Ph.D so this should probably be expected I guess).  Also I am not sure if the book successfully walks the tight rope of needed  depth vs lighter survey for introductory level concepts. Some users may  find it lacks enough depth while others will find it just a bit over their  head.	1999-08-25

Both of these books go into the nitty gritty details of how NT REALLY works in the real world and how best to  deploy and configure it.<br />Both are excellent primers on networking and  TCP/IP as well as NT specifics. Highly recommended.	1999-08-05
US	52944556	R1F4KHSAJSI9BQ	076453209X	161155819	NT Network Plumbing: Routers, Proxies, and Web Services	Books	5	6	6	N	N	You can't get your money out fast enough for ths one!	I had occasion to go through portions of this book again recently and could not help but be amazed, again, at how complete and information packed it is. Not only does it cover everything you REALLY need to know about NT  networking but Tony writes in a wonderfully easy style that makes digesting  all the deep tidbits--and there are a lot of those--easy.<br />The previous  reviewer who said that this book is not long enough is right on. When you  finish the book you will be amazed at what you did NOT know and want the  author to keep telling you.<br />We can only hope Tony revamps this book for  Windows 2000. If you run NT networks this book is a must have. It is also  an excellent companion to studying for many of the MCSE tests because  you'll disocver how things REALLY work.	1999-07-28

The examples are quick and to the point and I found them much more useful in my day-to-day work then the more convoluted &quot;application&quot; examples given in many of the other ASP  books. This is not to say ASP 2.0 Prog. Ref. replaces those books only that  the book does succeed as a great reference guide.<br />I did not find the  chapter format to be a problem as items seem to fall into the chapters  rather logically.<br />I find myself using the book more and more and think it  is well worth the money.	1999-06-16

The material is excellent overall but very much geared  towards the Web elite. When he talks about building Web sites for  100hits/sec he is not kidding. You will find little useful to you if you  are an average Webmaster or especially an NT Webmaster. As a result, I  think only a fraction of the readers of the book will be able to apply many  of tips/tools/techniques Philip details in his book. Nevertheless, it is a  good and fascinating read and may spur one on to investigate the higher  end.	1999-01-23
