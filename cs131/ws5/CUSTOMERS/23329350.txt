Tidbits of real-life epiphanies have made their way from his Dinosaurs in the Attic into his last solo novel The Codex.<br /><br />With four solo efforts taking place in the American Southwest, a 1000 mile horseback trip in the same deserts, and the southwest-based Thunderhead (co-written with Lincoln Child) all under his belt, it was only a matter of time before \\"Hoss\\" Preston returned to archaeology, astronomy, paleontology, geology, and meteors (remember The Ice Limit?); this time, the evidence is found on another celestial body.<br /><br />Tyrannosaur Canyon is 100 pages shorter than this past summer's release Dance of Death and slightly shorter than The Codex. Preston's style, however, promises to deliver, packing a wallop of an adventure story. Expect intricate details interconnecting millions of years--eons of geologic change, a time now petrified--together.  Some of the best chapters are those told by the perspective of a female T. Rex.<br /><br />The plot is metamorphically original and will leave you speechless when you turn the last page.  The body of Preston's novel, however, suffers from an unfortunate lack of intriguing characters, two of whom return from The Codex (although this is not a sequel of sorts).  The bulk of the story is also a chase through the desert; a chase that grows really old, really quickly.  Preston keeps our attention with cutaways to the multiple antagonists (a move Bobby Fischer would be proud of) that threatens the story-line from nearly every possible angle.<br /><br />As a fan of Preston's works, both solo and co-authored, I feel this is an improvement since The Codex.  Alas, it drags on for too long and ends briefly at a point that, were he to extend the last few chapters, would have made one of the best third acts in any book published this year.<br /><br />By the way, probably due to the so-called \\"similar\\" title, Publisher's Weekly compared this book to Crichton, only embarrassing the reviewer in the end. Crichton's and Preston's style have absolutely nothing in common, aside from the \\"written word.\\" Ignore all \\"alter-title references\\" (e.g. \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark meets The Amazing Race\\" - Entertainment Weekly) as this is the most insulting form of praise. Read the book for what it is.br /> <br />By the way, probably due to the so-called \\"similar\\" title, Publisher's Weekly compared this book to Crichton, only embarrassing the reviewer in the end.

In an Adventure with Scientists: A Novel	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Avast Yer Dead Lights' Perusin' an' Plunder Me Words	What a small treasure!<br /><br />The Pirates! can be read in a day, but I purposefully stretched it out to savor the intensely deadpan charisma that Gideon Defoe's story radiates.  The book is brimming with quirky characters, silly misadventures, ham, inventive uses of current science, and nods to real-life buccaneers and piratical novels (including the author's own ancestor's, with whom some may be familiar).<br /><br />Mr. Defoe asserts that the book's origin lay in that of female wooing, and sharp-eyed readers will have fun catching passing references to the mysterious woman; unfortunately the woman was left unimpressed---was it Defoe's use of underhanded semantics, or perhaps the offensive basting of a ham?---, and the author is left with only a published novel and, presumably, any other swooning Londoner that can claim his acquaintance.<br /><br />Leading the tumultuous troupe is the Pirate Captain who has a peculiar weakness for ham.  His very character reminded me of Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirate King (who sinks \\"a few more ships, it's true, than a well-bred monarch ought to do\\"!) who has peculiar weaknesses himself (orphans).  It's well known that some real-life pirate captains had weaknesses for married men, whose lives would be saved for that very reason!  Defoe's Pirate Captain also requires a bit of counsel from his trusty quartermaster, the pirate with a scarf.  The two take extensive care to spoil themselves and their fellow knaves with hilarious digressions from their ultimate goal: to rescue Darwin's brother from the nefarious Bishop of Oxford.  (There are actually two adversaries in the book!)  Of course, how they all join up is half the battle and twice the fun.  I was in stitches during a particular episode in which a scientist explains why he switched his airship from helium to hydrogen.  I hadn't laughed that hard at a pirate novel since the cannonball \\"horseplay\\" in Treasure Island.<br /><br />Defoe crams the book with footnotes that include scraps of history or random thoughts.  The not-so-subtle anachronisms make the read that much more enjoyable, while vaguely alluding to George MacDonald Fraser's genius work, The Pyrates, published 21 years previously.  Defoe also kindly includes a comprehension exercise at the end.  A jolly book all around, and one that demands many re-reads in the future.<br /><br />Addendum: Ham is a cut of a hog's thigh.  I prefer the center cut steak myself.hts.

Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini	Books	5	14	18	N	N	Oily Fruits	Several books have (somewhat) helped me to figure out the crazy world we've all woken up to, ranging from the scientific, like How Do You Go to the Bathroom in Space, to the tedious Imponderables® books, like When Do Fish Sleep.  Mark Leyner and Billy Goldberg have discovered the real questions that matter!  The more enlightening (and surprising) questions relate to quotidian elements that we've more or less subconsciously suppressed the urge to wonder about.  Or so we'll admit.<br /><br />In college, I had two professors (two old men who taught different aspects of Georgian Literature) who were hilarious and made difficult literature immensely enjoyable.  Why Do Men Have Nipples (easy literature) wasn't written by those guys, but I would've hardly guessed it.  You won't be forgetting some of the answers quickly.

While Dust is never fully explained in the first book, it is comprised of elementary particles, adding a touch of molecular science to some of the story, something I enjoyed greatly.<br /><br />Within this otherwise similar parallel universe, each human has his own daemon.  The daemon (pronounced the same as \\"demon\\") is a separate entity, in this case with abilities to morph between animal shapes, who is directly connected to the human's soul.  The daemon, of course, is not a new idea, and older readers may enjoy spotting other mythological references or etymons that Pullman used in the development of character names and geographical places.<br /><br />One can hardly avoid all the decade-belated praise this book has been receiving.  Even an old client of mine would call to discuss this book and I had no clue what he would be talking about.  The Golden Compass is far more complex than I first imagined in terms and may be a bit more difficult for children to read than the Harry Potter series (I am otherwise *not* comparing the two, though one can't help notice amazing coincidences).<br /><br />My own opinion is that the book, which will affect each reader differently, simply wasn't as good as I was being told.  This does not mean the book is no good at all.  I recommend everyone try it for him- or herself, as it is a quick read.  Also, a friend said the first two books are somewhat expositional in nature, while the third (The Amber Spyglass travels between the two universes) ties everything together and elevates the story as a whole.  Perhaps.<br /><br />A quick note: some people seem to garner a sort of fetish with comparing fictional churches with the Church in real life, and they ingeniously expose clandestine remarks that purportedly debase and insult religion.  If Pullman is doing this, it is not to be found in The Golden Compass.  His re-writing of certain biblical passages is a remarkably effective means of segregating this fictional universe from ours, and I'm guessing some readers are too busy criticizing to remember this.to be found in The Golden Compass.

With the eerie, dimly-lit after-hours scenes in the New York Museum of Natural History, and everyone's favorite FBI agent (whoda thunk they'd have one?) Aloysius Pendergast at wit's end, Preston and Child have let loose a book that is the first to terrify me since Thunderhead's preternatural hauntings (and Reliquary's subterranean tunnels before that)!<br /><br />With its florid prose and exquisitely detailed interweaving plots, Dance of Death takes Pendergast where he has never been before: confounded.  We learn a lot more about Mr. P and the cruelty streak that runs through his family, currently culminated into mastermind Diogenes, the brother who has been waiting all these years to perfect and, now, execute a machination that will torment everyone, including the reader.  And although the book is the second of a strangely sequestered trilogy, it succeeds at holding its own.<br /><br />Douglas Preston -- having partially documented, and worked at, the American Museum of Natural History -- and Lincoln Child -- possessed of supernatural cunning -- tell a tale verging on undefined genres.  They have released what I believe to be their best book to date.  Brimstone embraced the history of mystery literature and surprised us with musical intrigue.  Dance of Death follows in its historically referential footsteps...you will see what I mean.<br /><br />Especially notable is Flag Tonuzi's jacket design which lacks the ubiquitous summary on the inside of the dust cover, replaced in this instance with the tarot card motif and a movie-like tagline.  The fonts used (uncredited) are perfect for the story, suggesting a sort of \\"burnt\\" gothic feel (subconsciously?), while the chapters and head page numbers are in a more demonic form that harken back to old engravings of witch-hunts and sorcery.	2005-07-23

A planet that feeds off of intelligence.  With a great title (and cover to boot), a very interesting plot, and Picard and Data as the main heros here, I thought there would be nothing to disappoint.<br /><br />Diane Duane commences on a languid note, introducing her Holodeck motif immediately.  She uses the Holodeck better in subsequent scenes.  I've always loved comparing Picard, Captain of a Starship, to a captain of a seafaring vessel.<br /><br />Two other starships are brought in to aid in tracking this mysterious shifting predator.  That's about all the excitement that happens.  Deaths are treated as nuisances.  The dialogue is supremely dry and everyone speaks as if voiced as one person.  Two attempts are made at humor, near the end of the book, and are devastatingly timed.  When operating a starship under attack, succinctness, I should think, would be of the essence.  The captain does not joke with (in this case) her XO while attempting evasive or offensive maneuvers.  Perhaps this wouldn't have been so bad had the captain and her XO established a joking relationship earlier, but nary a word was spoken between them beforehand.<br /><br />I highly recommend the well-written books of Michael Jan Friedman and Peter David over this contractual bilge.	2005-07-22

Alas, it appears on page 135, spoken like a true criminal mastermind with the fortitude of a German tank.  This is Peter Branson, the man behind an admittedly complex presidential kidnapping, who spits (smoothly!) this remark to the President's face, he who asked a question meant to confirm his worst fear: his life, and those of several important Arabian representatives, a shiek, and an oil king, hangs by a thread.<br /><br />Half a billion dollars is required payment for their lives.  MacLean chose a sum that may have seemed exorbitant in 1976, but still holds as incredibly high for a tale told nearly 30 years later.<br /><br />MacLean is in near-top form as he takes the reader through the antagonists' point of view, their set-up, and how they nab the president in the very middle of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Only then does Agent Paul Revson arrive (and in an unexpected way).  His affiliation with MacLean's greatest heroes (Michael Reynolds, Peter Mason, John Carter) could be that of a direct bloodline; his flaws make him human, but his extravagant conception of Branson's downfall makes him a military genius.  The true Army of One.<br /><br />The first paragraph is a little deviant---straying from MacLean's signature first sentence idioms---written in a peculiar checklist method.  I mention this only because I am aware of MacLean's slight decline in effective storytelling which many have claimed began with The Way to Dusty Death, a title I have yet to read, but I will dispute this notion: Breakheart Pass, Circus, and The Golden Gate are as fabulous, if less character driven, than his earlier books.  The Golden Gate is no exception, surpassing Circus in scope and suspense!<br /><br />Keep an eye out for General Carter.  The last name is carried over from the hero of The Golden Rendezvous.

I allowed some time to pass after completing it to let the story to sink in and grow in my mind.  I already miss that \\"I can't wait to get back to read it\\" feeling.<br /><br />Card's characters are ultra-realistic.  I sensed some origin in his style of writing that has spread through other writers, including Kim Stanley Robinson, perhaps paid as an homage to Ender's Game.  The book is an intruiging look at how the government could effectively create soldiers from their young age, when they are most influential (in both senses of the word: they can be influenced, they can influence others).<br /><br />Having read this, I can see where many others have literally ripped off a great idea.  To say more would be to destroy the plot.  Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin is born into a strange future where the government controls birth rates.  He was \\"asked for\\" simply because his brother, Peter, and guardian angel-like sister, Valentine, were deemed unuseable by military standards.  So Ender is born, monitored, and then taken to be trained.  He will become an efficient and ruthless commander.  The voyage to this point is white-knuckling.<br /><br />This is a book to set aside and re-read in the future.

More than a year has passed since I read it and just today I found the book on the shelf at my library. I finally copied down the ISBN (0805502041) and every little nitpickin' specification about this book--the Los Angeles Public Library system is so bad that, in this case, this book isn't even listed under the title or author, so I was never able to put it on hold.<br /><br />My love of reading began with my first book. But my love of fine literature began with this book. I was actually looking for The Count of Monte Cristo when I chanced upon Musketeers. Why the heck not, said I, and I read it.<br /><br />This book is perfect. This version, in particular, is the 1976, and inexpensive, version of printed editions that, to this day, sell for hundreds of dollars or more!<br /><br />Included are more than 250 illustrations by Maurice Leloir. These are *real* illustrations. Not madly-designed \\"inspired\\" works that other editions unashamedly use. If I were a kid, and in many ways I am still one, these are the illustrations I would remember having grown up with. J. Huyot did the engravings off which the printed images are based. These two men are geniuses in their own right.<br /><br />I would have no other translation. William Robson translated many novels in the 1850s. I wish I knew more about him. I don't know enough French yet to re-read Dumas's work, but I am certain Robson's translation is just as pristine in its prose. Be prepared to do a little dictionary sweeping, as well. This isn't written in modern babble.<br /><br />This book deserves a respectful review, one written by a calm and inspired reader. Unfortunately, I am far too euphoric...the conclusion to my happiness in re-finding this book is obvious: I must purchase a nice copy.<br /><br />I recommend finishing the series with the Oxford Classics editions. I enjoyed each book immensely. I read the last page of The Man in the Iron Mask, and I have never cried so hard in my life for nearly anything.

Unfortunately for him, Alistair MacLean could almost care less.  As a lover of MacLean novels, I am well aware of his post-1973 dilemma: I was prepared to flip through a novel that lacks character development (unlike The Secret Ways, an exception to the 1973 rule), an extraordinary plot (Where Eagles Dare), hilarious moments of character/nature interaction (When Eight Bells Toll), super-secrets and amazing lies (The Golden Rendezvous) and awesome twists (Ice Station Zebra).<br /><br />River of Death isn't awful; Mr. MacLean's plot would work well for a novella, but instead it was stretched out to 200 pages with a lot of possibility gone to a dusty death.  What this book lacks in suspense and drive is often-enough--albeit partially--made up for with MacLean's more amusing bits of description.  For example, he describes John Hamilton \\"[w]ith his tangled hair, a week's growth of matted and bloodied beard, and ripped and bloodstained shirt...[looking] as if he had just returned from the scene of a successfully if messily executed triple murder\\" (35).  MacLean has always made me laugh with remarks like this.<br /><br />Sadly, the reader is left in the dark as to why Hamilton looks like this in the first place.  An interesting character with no background!  What was he doing that resulted in his bodily mess?  Unimportant to the plot at hand, apparently.  And while MacLean is still Prince of Plot Twists, you can count them here on one hand.<br /><br />The best part of the book are the WWII chapters at the beginning.  I almost wished he'd continued that timeline (rather than jumping forward an unspecified amount of decades).  The second best part of the book are the exhilirating last seven sentences.  To say any more would be to give away the thin plot, but for compensation, there are helicopters, hovercrafts, doublecrosses, wild jungle beasts, uncivilized tribes, and a Lost City!<br /><br />This is one of the most difficult reviews I have ever written.  I feel like I am insulting a great author.  But his slow decline into alcoholism probably affected these later tales.  Despite the indifference in the plotting, the book was still published and, as I've said, will work as a great time-killer for MacLean fans.  Do not judge the author on this work alone.<br /><br />I read the 1983 Fawcett Crest edition (see \\"customer images\\").  If you get your hand on this paperback, I seriously recommend avoiding the description on the back.  My dictionary dash included dross (3), Sybaritic (25), and atavistic (69), this last a trait MacLean neglects.difficult reviews I have ever written.  I feel like I am insulting a great author.

While some may claim it is better than Sandstorm, I believe it is better than Ice Hunt.<br /><br />The nature of novels being released recently has changed: thrillers no longer just entertain.  These books are nearly educational.  The reader will finish these tales understanding a little more about the world around them.  Included in my \\"informant thriller\\" genre is Michael Crichton's State of Fear and the inevitable Dan Brown books.  These are all meticulously researched with exciting tales weaved around the science and history of our world, albeit slightly opinionized (excusable if the story is good).<br /><br />Rollins's Map of Bones re-creates a real secret society with a real history.  The Vatican plays a vital backdrop, but Rollins does not expound on the religious history with near-insulting revelations (as some authors have recently done), nor does he extoll the darker side of the Vatican.  I believe what he has pulled off with Map of Bones is a genuine novel full of suspense, mystery, extremely cool science, and a lot of it is real, but fictionally portrayed.  Rollins is delicate in his handling of the religious aspects.<br /><br />While I firmly believe this is Rollins's best book, I still have reservations: the prologue is entirely nonessential.  Character development is still ignored in the larger scheme of plot.<br /><br />Rollins's characters are remarkable geniuses at retaining information (great for problem solving).  Uncle Vigor, for example, will whip out exact dates and detailed historical anecdotes throughout the course of the book.  (His position in the Vatican, however, allows this to be realistic, as he is required to know history.)<br /><br />On the other hand, Rollins's greatest character here is Kat Bryant, a quieter member of Grayson Pierce's team.  She is the only character who is flawed and makes errors: she does what she deems correct, which sometimes puts others in trouble.  Kat is reminiscent of Alistair MacLean's greatest heros -- British Secret Service agents who are only doing what they can to save the day, but who constantly doubt themselves.  I enjoyed her few scenes of \\"solo\\" efforts greatly.<br /><br />All this aside, Rollins changed his formula for the better.  With Map of Bones, the characters are struggling to solve some of the most intriguing riddles in popular fiction up to the very end.<br /><br />As per Rollins's \\"author's note,\\" we are left hanging.  The reader should hopefully realize some questions are left unanswered.  Perhaps the reasons are for future books...?<br /><br />I was delighted to find my preconception of this book was wrong, and I had a difficult time putting it down.  This is a book where you can't wait to reach the end, and the reader is well rewarded!  Whatever Rollins did right, he did it well.  Map of Bones is one of the few books where I would cheer out loud or actually feel my heart thumping in the more nerve-racking scenes.

I myself suspected someone from nearly the very beginning, only to find that, had I been a police inspector, I would have quickly lost my job for nearly imprisoning an innocent character.<br /><br />But then, this is true for nearly the entire police force here (and in other Marple books), for it always comes down to Jane Marple's discourse on her facts and her timeline that sets everyone down the correct path.  And while in The Body in the Library (third in the series) Miss Marple waits for proof before opening her mouth, here she must speak up in order to... well, you will just have to see.<br /><br />The book is fun, and the vicar's opinionated personality makes for a very intriguing read (what do these religious personalites really think about everyone?).  What immediately stood out was how Christie is able to make nearly everyone (this is a dozen characters!) quite possibly the murderer!  The finale is, of course, the best part, and I would think to myself, \\"Ah that explains it, but then what about...\\" to which I would find the answer.  This occurs four or five times, and even then the reader will have two pages to go to wrap up little details that he or she may have quite forgotten about!<br /><br />The book drags in some areas probably due to our modern requisite for instant gratification.  And it was a joy to compare the book cover's painting to the goings-on in the text.  I read the 1979 Dell edition.<br /><br />My dictionary dash consisted of only badinage (131) and vituperation (180).<br /><br />Aside: I found a receipt tucked halfway through the book; the price being $1.95, tax 13¢ and dated 18Oct75.

He doesn't produce miracles from his back pocket while falling from 13,000 feet.  Our hero in The Secret Ways is a well-trained, conditioned-to-kill secret service agent who is extricated from complex situations countless times by peers (and enemies themselves!).  He relies on unimpaired judgment, common sense, and possesses a faculty of wit and courage.<br /><br />The title, though somewhat awkward in my opinion, references the clandestine techniques utilized by both sides of the story.  The Hungarians have their \\"secret ways\\" of propelling propagandistic motives and the British have their ways of countering and annihilating such tactics.  In a sense, the title is a direct reference to Michael Reynolds.<br /><br />MacLean takes a subtler approach to this novel.  Reynolds character reminded me of a more subdued version of Philip Calvert, hero from When Eight Bells Toll.  He questions himself consistently, makes errors, and saves lives.<br /><br />The writing style (told in the third person) is different.  Rather than focusing on the action of the story, MacLean leans into the landscape and describes the surroundings with more attention than he has in previous novels.  There are lengthy discourses between characters regarding country reformation and politics in general.  There are moments when MacLean purposely slows the story down, explicitly describing a state or emotion a character may be experiencing.<br /><br />The Secret Ways is probably the most realistic book of his I have read.  Due to the heavy (albeit significant) nature of politics in areas, it is a slower read.  The action sequences, of which there are countless, quickly make up for this.  But the variety of characters and their camaraderie here will keep the reader from feeling isolated.  And Reynolds's touching episode with a handkerchief filled my eyes with tears, something I didn't expect from a MacLean novel.<br /><br />I read the 1959 Fawcett Gold Medal edition.

I read this edition (Pocket book, 1970), and I was attracted to the initial romanticism of a dead body in a private library.  Libraries are dark and notoriously eerie.<br /><br />The book starts off hilariously, but quickly becomes an interesting investigation that shakes up a bourgeoise English town.  I was suprised at how quiet Miss Marple is, and how much she sort of disappears into the background.  It isn't until the end that she even begins raising her voice to get some answers.<br /><br />The investigation itself is nothing new.  People are questioned and the reader is led to believe the facts fit together.  Miss Marple, of course, provides the fresh insight that ultimately twists everything around.  \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\" becomes the embarrassing thought in every policeman's -- and reader's -- minds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this being the third Christie book I've read, I didn't get that thrilling feeling of following a murder case in an exotic locale.  For this, I recommend And Then There Were None, or Murder on the Orient Express.  Also, I've come to realize that, as a reader, I prefer multiple murders, serial killings, and inevitable doom.  In The Body in the Library, we have nearly three murders, but I wanted more!<br /><br />The book itself is an extremely easy and quick read, making for a great summer/travel read.

It's powers are beyond comprehension, and it ends up in the hands of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.  With what control does he wield the great power of Pagrashtak, the bloodstone, this Devil's Heart that can, and has, created and annihilated civilizations?<br /><br />Pretty much nothing.  Be prepared for a history lesson.  Carter's tale isn't so much about what Picard does with the stone but, rather, how Picard learns, through an unrelenting amount of dreams, where the stone has come from, and its destiny.  The cover of this book caught my attention: Picard with eyes glowing red.  What a fantastic cover!  Our beloved starship captain with powers not unlike what Riker once held as a gift from Q!<br /><br />And, oh sure, Picard uses these powers, once.  The possibilities of this book went straight down the drain.  I find solace in reading adventures about our humble Federation crew, but this was not at all what I expected.  Picard becomes neither demon nor saint, but somnambulist.<br /><br />Fear not, for those of us who expect good writing get it anyway.  Carter's sketches of Data's thought processes is so well-written that, if they still produce ST:TNG books, I hope she does one with Data as the lead.  She writes every Enterprise character believably (nearly with the same internal descriptions as she does with Data), which is more than I can say about many other ST authors.	2005-06-16

Attending the World Quidditch Cup is easily his greatest desire.  To be in the company of his best friends Ron and Hermione, with whom he has shared many a preternatural adventure, is a glowing wish.  Complete exoneration of the Dudleys' horrific nephew-management, a yearning that soon becomes fulfilled.  In Goblet of Fire, the reader will see Harry Potter as a truly happy fourteen year old boy.<br /><br />For a short while.  Then mysterious, secret things begin to happen.  What seems amusing to some becomes a reality of causative catastrophe.  Demonic events unfold beneath the reader's very nose, without him or her being aware of it.  J. K. Rowling's tale of delight holds clues that seem to Apparate in the closing chapters of the book.  Goblet of Fire takes first place as a modern mystery whodunnit, out-twisting even Prisoner of Azkaban.<br /><br />The skillful writing of Rowling's hand intermingles, entwines, and combines sub-plot after sub-plot, until the amalgam of Harry's universe is entirely realistic; the reader's brain swells with concentration.  The details are enormous in count.  One must re-read the book to seize every known factor, simply to comprehend.<br /><br />Pretty soon, the days begin to look grim, and not just for Harry.  Who would want to go out with Hermione, the bushy haired, big-toothed know-it-all?  When will Ron ever get a chance to step out of Harry's shadow?  What's to become of Fred and George's new entrepreneurial ventures?  Will Professor Snape ever stop hating Gryffindors (and Neville especially)?  And why doesn't the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor trust anyone?  Secrets, that's why!  In \\"The Beginning,\\" Rowling exposes Hogwarts castle to a terror unmistakably foreign to its innocent occupants.<br /><br />Rowling's book is a literal vector transporting all of us far away from our own distorted lives, directly into the bubbling turmoil that is the wizarding community.  A silly lot, aren't they?  But as clever as they are (with Muggles), almost toying with \\"our\\" world (as is evident in earlier books), the overall camaraderie between individuals in Goblet of Fire proves that many wizards and witches, be they malicious or virtuous, are passionate.  Everyone is connected by two common designs: life and magic.

Truth be told, it took me three times before I completely understood everything.<br /><br />Having read all books released (currently five), Chamber of Secrets has always troubled me.  Not because Rowling's story is difficult to comprehend, but because Voldemort is different here.  I can speak no further without spoiling anything, but the reader must really pay attention as to what's going on.<br /><br />There is so much going on here, far more than in the first book, that I found myself reading slower, in order to retain as many details as possible.  The first book's conclusion makes the reader aware that he or she is not just reading a hack author.  These stories are brilliantly thought-out.  So obviously the second book will be as complex.  This time, the reader is prepared to make mental notes, remember as many of those \\"little\\" details... and still, so much slips through, re-reading the book is almost obligatory to fully enjoy Harry Potter's adventure.<br /><br />Like Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets is a stand alone effort that if, for some strange reason, anyone were to read before any of the other books, the mystery would unfold as any good murder-mystery would. And, both these books are what I would deem murder-mysteries, a wonderful genre, in my opinion.  Many of the greatest novels ever penned were classic whodunnit tales.  This is one of Rowling's many strengths (and a great addition to the \\"classics,\\" I say).<br /><br />After completing book 2, the reader will come to terms with Rowling's writing style: it is quite simply the most efficient, well organized, humorous, dramatic, and comprehensively detailed style I've come across.  Rowling's tales are pure enjoyment, almost hearkening to oral tradition.  You feel as if the story is being told to you.<br /><br />While the first book is filled with nervous first-years, here, Harry and his friends are now focusing on adventure (and half the adventure is just getting through those difficult classes!).<br /><br />Rowling's new characters are simply delightful.  No two characters are the same, and it is impossible to confuse them with one another.  And while my eyes only well-up at the end (Sorcerer's Stone makes me burst into actual tears everytime I read how they win the House Cup), I am moved in a different way...

I was one of them until very recently.<br /><br />Fear not the stereotype that this book is children's fiction.  J. K. Rowling has given us a book that isn't all magic and fancifulness.  Sorcerer's Stone is an incredible murder-mystery.  And here is where I, a fan of Agatha Christie and Alistair MacLean novels, have found an alternate reason to tell skeptics, or late-comers, to read this book.<br /><br />Ms. Rowling has already written a good portion of an adult mystery novel (while on a break from Books 4 and 5), and it comes as no surprise.  Her published novels are so well thought out, you will turn the pages at the end of the book to find resolution on subjects that you may have completely forgotten about, or thought unimportant.  Everything comes together beautifully.  There is one major question here that leaves this book impossible to read merely as a solo effort: why does Voldemort want Harry Potter dead?<br /><br />Ah, well, there you must read about Years Two, Three, Four, Five, soon Six, and conclude with Seven eventually.  Then, and only then, will Year One: The Sorcerer's Stone come full circle and that last question will be answered.<br /><br />Rowling has produced a novel that is so intricate and complex, while so immensely enjoyable, that re-reading it is an incredible experience.  There are things that will click, make you think, Ah! a character clandestinely introduced to me here but who doesn't appear until much later, or a magical gizmo that comes to play farther down the timeline.<br /><br />I am honored to be a part of the (at this time) 5000 reviewers who are proud to share this story with friends, and strangers (you, hopefully!) alike.	2005-05-24

What could be more adventurous than Riker stuck in an alien jungle with dinosaur-like creatures, no phaser, and a gaggle of asinine aliens?  To be honest, I thought the idea sounded fantastic.<br /><br />Did Doranna Durgin pull it off?  As an avid reader, and a fan of Star Trek books, I can't outright say she did a stellar job.  I understand that writing books in a series previously created by alternate writers can be difficult.  Believe it or not, Durgin doesn't really have trouble with this.  The characters seemed believable.<br /><br />What I didn't like was how the story was told, how it was handled, and the two alien races that are both on the insipid and uninteresting side.<br /><br />The story is so convoluted, I couldn't comprehend what was going on at any given point.  Also, Durgin constantly interrupts a good flowing sentence with speech-like ramifications, or corrections.  For example, she will write a sentence, then follow it with, \\"Well, actually it was...\\" or \\"Well, almost, but...\\"; this is repeated countless hundreds of times (it's presumably Durgin's writing style, which I find too distracting for my tastes).  (Not to sound like an English professor, but she overuses incomplete sentences as well.)<br /><br />Durgin's characters will suddenly materialize in a building on a planet (?) then back on the Enterprise, or with different characters suddenly walking in when I thought they were miles away.<br /><br />The two alien species are so undeveloped and poorly written that I had a difficult time remembering who was supposed to be short, who's son was whom, and at this very moment (having recently completed the book) I have no idea what technology was used to cause the sun to go nova, or who owns the technology or, more importantly, why anyone would do that to a sun, or why the technology wasn't used for a more intriguing purpose other than to possibly kill off an unintelligent race.<br /><br />Why would any alien creature create a habitat that operates like a public zoo, one that is open only several times a day, with days-long interims between openings?  And why did Durgin, being a wildlife illustrator, create creatures that were pathetically unoriginal?  Picture a snake with hands.  Or an elephant sized furry something with two tails.  Every creature that had tails ended up always having two tails.  The creatures were not well thought out.  And the supposedly shy scavengers ended up hunting more than scavenging.<br /><br />I think a fitting quote takes place between Worf and Riker: \\"Worf looked at him, seemed to consider and assess.  'Things have not gone well.'  [Riker replies] 'You don't know the half of it\\" (163).  This conversation occurs 63 pages after the first of the adventures.<br /><br />Finally, something I've noticed in the dozen Star Trek books I've read so far: every TNG book is brimming with typos.  Where are these editors?  I do not hold this against Durgin, et al., nor do I count it toward my final rating.  But I've become fed up with it.<br /><br />I am writing a less-than-positive review as a common reader.  In the world of Star Trek, this book is one of the few poorly written books I've run across, and the story had enough potential to keep me reading to the end.  The book really gets good with 100 pages to go, and the last chapter is the best written until the last page (before it becomes convoluted and even Data's motif throughout the book is poorly explained).<br /><br />Keep an eye out for etymology scattered throughout.

The book really gets good with 100 pages to go, and the last chapter is the best written until the last page (before it becomes convoluted and even Data's motif throughout the book is poorly explained). <br /> <br />Keep an eye out for etymology scattered throughout.  The Latin word \\"ingenium\\" pops up, among others.	2005-05-19

I know many of Preston/Child books begin this way, but something was different this time.<br /><br />Child then naturally introduces the main character, his daughter, and the park. But the story seemed much too dependent on the park, the attraction of it. And what no one else has written here is that the writing is somewhat slowly paced, almost too much so for myself.<br /><br />In my first reading, I only read about a third of it and moved on to other books which were less than impressive.  But in my second reading of Utopia, I found that not only was I in the mood for the story (it's like watching a movie; you need to be in the right mood for it), it reminded me somewhat of my adventures in Las Vegas when I was younger. The book does, in fact, pick up speed, and, in what isn't new but is well done here, the story takes place in just one day!<br /><br />That said, there is a lot of exposition that has to be expounded upon at times, so the reader can be as up-to-date as Andrew Warne and his daughter. With the release of Still Life with Crows, I know that Child and Preston are a perfect team. Utopia, I think, is a brilliant effort into the thriller realm, and I can't wait for his second solo effort to really see what Mr. Child can do.<br /><br />His ideas are, by the way, extremely original.<br /><br />What's really neat is to see Mr. Child's idioms (he likes the term \\"bean counters\\"; also, see his photograph online at his website) and, at some points, he will use easy-to-miss expressions that are similar to his co-writing efforts. Keep an eye out for references to past books as well. All this makes for superb, inter-connected reading that is really tenfold the amount of fun if their other books have been read (and paid attention to).	2005-05-19

Simon Hawke's political negotiations are well thought out.  Actually, Hawke spends more time writing out these negotiations than he does concentrating on plot.  This slows the book down considerably for summer-breeze readers (like myself), but will definitely keep those intrigue-loving bookworms on the edge of their seat.<br /><br />The story is simple enough and there are several twists, only one of which caught me off guard (and it wasn't at the end).  Probably my favorite part was when Riker leads a covert away-mission to the planet, and everyone has to have fake names and history.  Hawke's idea of keeping everyone's names similar sounding (to avoid confusion among the away team) is actually a very intelligent thing to do.  Riker thusly becomes Stryker, and a sharp Trek-phile will recognize this name from the annals of Roddenberry's early mindset.<br /><br />Hawke's largest flaw is the title and its connotation.  I found no humor in an alien named Blaze helming a ship called Glory.  His second largest flaw is that Blaze is one of the coolest characters to pass through the Trek universe, and Hawke hardly utilizes him.  Even his major scenes seem like those of Frozone in the film \\"The Incredibles\\": huge potential, vastly under-developed.<br /><br />On the flip-side, Hawke's dialogue is dead-on believable, but not quite on par with Friedman or David.  His only other TNG book is \\"The Romulan Prize,\\" which I hope to read soon.	2005-05-17

Especially when it occurs onboard the beloved family-operated-and-owned Enterprise!<br /><br />I picked up this book for an easy read and got more than I bargained for.  I couldn't put it down.  Friedman's writing is superb, and I believe that, of all the Trek authors I've sifted and flipped through, he ranks as one of the best along with Peter David.<br /><br />Picard is placed in a vulnerable position here, where his present meets his past; I enjoyed seeing Picard stuck between nostalgic reminisces and keeping stern duty in the present time.  Meanwhile the people from the past have all \\"grown up\\" and made their way through the ranks.<br /><br />And then, as the hardcover blurb will have you believe, people start dying.<br /><br />Herein lies the flaw in this book.  While reading, I compared it to Alistair MacLean's \\"Bear Island\\" and Agathie Christie's \\"And Then There Were None,\\" both brilliant tales of people in secluded areas, who start dropping like flies.  (Christie's tale, in particular, will blow the reader away with its originality.)  Friedman is dealing with characters that cannot simply be dispensed with.  There are no \\"ensigns\\" to \\"off\\" during Picard's voyage to Daa'V.  So Friedman has to, unfortunately, resign himself to merely hurting members of his crew and passengers, rather than outright doing them in.<br /><br />This process infuriated me...perhaps I am spoiled, but with nearly everyone (save one or two) surviving each attack, how serious could this murderer be?  An assassin cannot make mistakes and must never leave witnesses.  A simple overlooked detail in this book becomes a major plothole: a survivor of an attempted murder lies in rehab, but never mentions who it was that attacked him or her, even though he or she obviously saw the killer.<br /><br />My final complaint regards the ending.  While the above is occurring, the Enterprise has been drawn into Romulan space.  Friedman had a fantastic opportunity to multi-layer the ending and make it even more complex and suspenseful.  Instead, after one mystery is solved, the Romulans are taken care of almost as an afterthought.<br /><br />So why four stars instead of three?  Friedman's writing is spectacular.  It is so incredibly realistic, that I forgave him for his above faults (as if I could do better).  His characters are funny, and I've always thought it was difficult to make me laugh out loud at a Star Trek character (aside from the innocent Data).  And besides, murder on the Enterprise is an almost unthinkable thing, and the idea alone kept me tense throughout.<br /><br />Plop down beside a river in the sunshine, forgive me for my rantings, and enjoy the book for what it really is.tunity to multi-layer the ending and make it even more complex and suspenseful.

I laughed a lot and enjoyed the film greatly (I think it's well done).<br /><br />The tale is immense in scope, so I figured I'd read the book.  I was in for a huge surprise.  Half of the film's ideas come from Brickhill's prelude, and have nothing to do with the actual escape (or camp!).  This meant only one thing: Brickhill's tale, thick as it is, is going to be completely original and that much more satisfying a read.<br /><br />Paul Brickhill was the boss of a small group of prisoners who worked as stooges (watching out for Germans espying on their prisoners' doings).  He writes fluidly and very well, and his obvious post-war research is superb (he tells the German angle in some parts).  The book is easy to read, has moments of humor, and the descriptions are fantastic and there is never, ever, a dull moment from page one.<br /><br />Little did I realize how much the film throws out the horrors of Nazi Germany (or seemingly takes it in stride).  The film plays out escaping as a game, and even in the book, characters try to escape constantly.  While the Geneva Convention includes a clause that states escaping should not be prosecuted severely, as it is a logical reaction to imprisonment, the reader will recall that Nazis don't necessarily believe in anything other than the word \\"kill.\\"  Therein lies the terror.<br /><br />There is no Steve McQueen here, and, while there is a cooler, it's the least of the prisoners' fears.  There isn't a small group of characters that the story revolves around.  There are hundreds of people, and Paul introduces them at varying and strategic places within the story.  You learn about new escapees up to the very last chapter.  Everyone is a hero in his own way.<br /><br />And while I was reading, I admittedly \\"forgot\\" about the Nazi terror and was constantly thrilled to see what would happen next, not realizing how everyone's lives were really in constant danger.  Chapter 19 is one of the most frightening moments in the book.  It is also the introduction of Hitler, and some of his own decisions regarding the Britons, the Americans, and even the Germans themselves.<br /><br />Brickhill's fears aren't of being caught and thrown into a cooler.  It is of being caught by the Kriminalpolizei, or the Gestapo, or of starving while eating illegally small portions of German rations (at one point, the prisoners are fed filthy water condensed on a motorcar engine).<br /><br />This book is quite simply amazing.  Do not expect the quasi-solo efforts of the brilliant escapes and happy fortunes as occurs in the book \\"Papillon.\\"  Expect frustrations, anger, impatience and, most of all, the miraculous teamwork that results into a years-long plan: the great escape.<br /><br />I read the 1966 Fawcett Crest edition (see \\"customer images\\"), which includes an introduction by Brickhill's Stalag Luft III cohort George Harsh, and new illustrations from fellow prisoner Ley Kenyon, based on his own original drawings from the war.st frightening moments in the book.

Being a MacLean fan, but with my current mentality, I figured he had finally run out of ideas (at this point in his life).  But the cover of the 1975 Fawcett Crest edition (see \\"customer images\\" for the paperback edition) was intriguing: a man falling off a high-wire, the bicycle tumbling after him.  Is someone killing off circus people?  I had to read.<br /><br />It turns out that the circus plays as a backdrop for a secret CIA mission.  Believe it or not, but the agenda in this tale is about an incredible circus performer recruited by the CIA to break into a prison (that the circus \\"moves\\" next to) to steal -- as the back of the book explains -- \\"a formula capable of annihilating the earth itself.\\"  Sure enough, MacLean was like the Crichton of the 70s and managed to weave an entertaining yarn around the idea of anti-matter (certainly not new in 1975).<br /><br />MacLean refrains from delving too deeply into describing anti-matter or how this formula will end up being used.  His somewhat amusing approach to it takes place as a discussion between semi-ignorant CIA agents and Bruno, the acquired circus performer, all of whom are frightened by the power of anti-particles.<br /><br />As the title may suggest, the book is a slight deviant from other MacLean adventure tales, but I rank it up there among his best works.  The book is full of extremely original death scenes that, despite being accustomed to MacLean's formulas, took me completely by surprise.  There are more twists in the last chapter than there are in some of his better books, and MacLean pulls it off realistically, and without creating a convoluted mess.<br /><br />Keep an eye out for Carter.  While no first name is ever given, he is the doppelganger cameo of Chief Officer John Carter of MacLean's \\"The Golden Rendezvous.\\"  (MacLean has done this with other characters throughout his novels.)	2005-05-03

And he cares about his plotlines as much as his first sentences as well.  Both are gripping and force you to read, and keep reading... just to see what happens next.<br /><br />What I like about MacLean's formula is that every book is suspenseful and nearly full of twists.  I say 'nearly' because sometimes MacLean will churn out a weaker tale for some reason.  But there is no doubt in my mind that The Golden Rendezvous is one of his best works.<br /><br />The older 1960s/70s books (see \\"customer images\\" for the paperback version) don't always clarify what the story is about.  Chief Officer John Carter is the typical pseudo-tragic hero who has his faults but also his strengths.  He works under Capt. Bullen, on the interesting freight ship Campari, altered by millions of dollars to provide ultra-rich passengers superb living and dining experiences, all the while travelling to unknown destinations.  The ship is only running its regular course of delivering freight around the world, so the passengers aren't booking a holiday fare, but rather a surprising adventure.  And on this particular voyage, the adventure threatens to bury everyone deep in Davy Jones's Locker.<br /><br />MacLean's description of Carter being dragged alongside the ship, unable to do anything but inhale salt water, violently resigning himself to his impending doom of a drowning death, had me on the edge of my seat, stomach churning at the idea.<br /><br />That's literally about all you can say without giving too much plot away.  This book had me reading late into the night, far more so than many of his other books.  I rank it up there with Ice Station Zebra, and Where Eagles Dare.	2005-04-28

Despite the fact that Rollins overuses the word \\"subterranean\\" in all his books (he refuses to say underground), he is a good writer, one of the better authors working today.  But his latest book, the first of his Sigma Force series, is a major disappointment.<br /><br />Omaha Dunn is not the main character.  But he should've been.  For a character-tribute to the genre's superstar Indiana Jones, Dunn had the most potential of anyone in the book.  Rollins brings him in late, and we get a weak pre-adventure adventure (Rollins introduces most of his characters in the middle of their own mini-sequences).  Painter Crowe, a cop with a cool name, is the flattest person here.  He thinks straight, shoots the same, but has no dimension, and is not very likeable.<br /><br />Safia and Kara are the two girls whose plotlines are the most important.  I really enjoyed these two.<br /><br />Here's the big upsetting thing: this is the first book I have read in years that has zero payoff.  You read me correctly: by the time you reach page 440 (hardcover), and you've paid close attention, you will notice that the whole book was for nothing.  I have not been this disappointed in a long time.  And perhaps this was a style Rollins was going for... a different approach to the Grand Finale.  But it didn't settle with me.<br /><br />Obviously this book works for most people, so do not fret, and enjoy the story!  But I heartily recommend Ice Hunt over Sandstorm as a great Rollins read.	2005-04-18

MacLean's tales are always a lot of fun, and this book isn't one to ignore.  My father owns a ton of these old MacLean paperbacks and, sifting through some of them to see what I hadn't already read, I was intrigued by the premise I found: plane crashes in Greenland during winter's zero-light months...night without end (and hardly anyone gets any sleep).  Several scientists working up there rescue the survivors, only to become potential victims themselves (they've only just enough food and other resources without keeping a host of foreigners barely alive)...<br /><br />And, in that awesome MacLean fashion, strange things begin happening.  It's a wonderful little tale, told in the first person.  And I love it when our hero, Dr. Peter Mason, like many of MacLean's heroes, lie.  I get that adrenaline rush knowing I know more than the other characters do -- save for the antagonists. You never know who they are, but you know they're aware of those lies.  It's the most fun one can have with a book, in a way.<br /><br />Night Without End isn't up to par with the best of the best MacLean tales, but it's damned close.  Expect a riveting ride through the Arctic, but don't hope for a zillion plot twists.  This is more of a whodunnit, and it keeps you guessing to the last few chapters...and even then you're wondering what's going to happen next.  MacLean, who has never really impressed me with landscape descriptions, pounds out fantastic scenes beneath the aurora borealis here.<br /><br />By the way, if you have the Fawcett Gold Medal Book (see \\"customer images\\") in your hand, avoid reading the excerpt at the beginning of the book.  You lose one potential suspect from that, unfortunately.	2005-04-18

But I read young adult and children's books often enough to know a good one when I come across one.<br /><br />Unfortunately, William Sleator disappoints with this one.  The tagline on the cover explicitly states \\"Now she's their toy...\\" and I expected just that.  The dolls are frightening enough, but there is huge potential (HUGE) with this story that Sleator merely avoids in order to keep the story within word-limit guidelines (I'm assuming).<br /><br />The twist as to how Vicki came to be inside the dollhouse is perfect, however, and caught me completely off guard.  Otherwise, for a Sleator book (he has written some very good tales!), a very mediocre effort.<br /><br />My copy, published by Knopf, has illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman.

But my father bought this for me and, as I enjoyed The Haunted Mesa immensely, figured this wouldn't be so bad a read.<br /><br />Flint is awesome.  He's not the archetype of the West, fortunately, since he has a \\"different\\" background than most cowboys and gunfighters.  But Flint is certainly one of the coolest guys on the continent from the 19th century.  And with L'Amour's own background with boxing, war, cowboy-type jobs, etc., the man can certainly weave a realistic tale.<br /><br />I will be honest here: this only being my second L'Amour book, I can't say his writing style appeals to me.  I'm more the techno-thriller or Alistair MacLean type (for 1960s books), but after reading Flint, I am ready to give Hondo a try and perhaps a few other L'Amour classics.<br /><br />I can't wait to get my father's opinion on the book.  There're so many battles here, in such a short book: complex business strategies, beautiful landscape of geologic interest with nary a soul vs. dusty towns with interesting and charming characters, women vs. men, wife vs. husband, intelligent gunfight sequences, hand-to-hand combat, goofy/clumsy characters, and frighteningly evil characters with wit to boot!<br /><br />For newcomers (like myself), the first 50 pages (Bantam paperback) is filled with backstory, exposition, and character introductions.  After that, 136 pages of non-stop suspense, action, and even a beautiful red stallion!	2005-04-18

Despite the awkward, James Rollins-ian title, Digital Fortress is actually a great thriller that utilizes Dan the Rubberband Man's now world renowned modus operandi: suspense that stretches on and on.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the 10 sentence Prologue.  What Alistair MacLean accomplishes in eight chapters, Brown requires 128.  America's most famous author knew the formula for attracting the attention span of today's market.  Combined with the brute-force attacks of his trademark histories, Brown learned how to intertwine his ultra-weak character development with fascinating bits of trivia.  In fact, Mr. Brown starts the excitement right off the bat: \\"...a quiet thank you to the two faceless ex-NSA cryptographers....\\"  Now who wouldn't fall for this wonderful touch of marketing brilliance?<br /><br />I'm not sure exactly what strings Mr. Brown tugged to publish Digital Fortress, but as a first work, it's not bad.  It's fun to see where he came from, how his writing style *hasn't* changed, but how he learned to incorporate more legends, myths, and the usual controversial fare.  You'll find a few things here including some history of the NSA, a couple of amusing parodies of the NSA anagram, a definition of a word, and just enough background on cryptography to satisfy our demands for a high narrative-research ratio.<br /><br />The book is remarkably easy to read.  And every time I put it down, I couldn't wait to pick it back up.  I really did enjoy reading it.  Brown's weaknesses are pretty obvious: repetition (to make sure you understand an element before the twist is revealed -- a dead giveaway), and making intelligent characters a touch dimmer in some areas (so the reader knows more than they do), and then ever so slightly ultra-resourceful.<br /><br />Do not ruin this little anecdote by expecting another Da Vinci Code.

This sentence is a perfect example of the humor (you'll know it's humor soon enough) MacLean writes into our hero's personality.<br /><br />While I've noticed MacLean's first-person narratives contain fair amounts of his dry wit, When Eight Bells Toll is the first book of his that has made me laugh out loud on several occasions.  My favorite part was when Philip Calvert, the hero, is running through trees in a heavy downpour, and he can't see where he is going, so he keeps running into trees.  His thoughts as this is happening is simply a delight to read!  A British secret service agent with a sense of humor.<br /><br />Of course, MacLean's book is not all laughable.  Calvert and his boss must figure out why ships and their crews are disappearing - and each vessel had been carrying valuable cargo.  I enjoyed reading Captain Imrie's doppelganger (he's a far nicer character in Bear Island).<br /><br />MacLean isn't afraid of killing off characters.  And he throws in the usual dash of twists to toss the reader off his seat, although it has fewer than some of his other books.  The book is also loaded with exposition.  I found myself dragging my eyeballs over some of the pages, unfortunately.<br /><br />While the book kept me guessing to the very end -- and you're guessing about an extraordinary amount of things -- I didn't feel it was MacLean's strongest work.  This is on a sliding scale, of course, as I feel MacLean's tales are more complex in design and more realistic than many modern books published today.<br /><br />The title refers to seafaring vessels and crew who keep track of time by ringing bells.  Eight bells represents six different hours of the day, one of which is midnight.  Of the time-span each chapter represents, I noticed chapter six (8:40 pm - 10:40 pm) is the only chapter that takes place between the three bells and six bells of the first (evening) watch, meaning eight bells never \\"toll\\" during this chapter.  Unrelated, but interesting to note, is that a Christian church will ring a bell nine times for the death of someone.<br /><br />Mr. MacLean also slightly rewrote the story for the 1971 film with Anthony Hopkins.the only chapter that takes place between the three bells and six bells of the first (evening) watch, meaning eight bells never \\"toll\\" during this chapter.

I suppose everyone expects a classic thriller par MacLean.<br /><br />Bear Island is less a thriller than it is a mystery, which explains the somewhat slower-than-usual pacing.  MacLean brings back Captain Imrie (from When Eight Bells Toll) who is a good guy this time.  Rather, he's a sub-character, piloting the Morning Rose to Bear Island.  Aboard is a film crew and the producers/directors of the most anticipated film of the year.<br /><br />And then people start dropping like flies.  I love it!  It's very reminiscent of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None or William Dietrich's more recent Dark Winter.  The classic premise: a bunch of people somehow completely isolated, and it's just not the best week for any of them.<br /><br />Bear Island is written in first-person (an immediate MacLean favorite), written with that ubiquitous dry wit found in his other novels.  Despite the obvious -- more whiskey and scotch downed than there is water in the ocean, and that Bear Island only appears halfway into the book -- I found myself enjoying every page.  And it turns out Bear Island is actually a very beautiful island.  I recommend Googling for images (see \\"customer images\\" for book cover).  Don't expect MacLean to describe it too well, since it's dark, cloudy, windy and rainy during the tale.	2005-03-15

Sometime before 1930, by the age of twenty-two, our author became the first Superintendent of Game for the Conservation Commission of the State of Wisconsin.  To quote the back-flap of my edition: \\"[Grange] became engaged in the business of live-trapping and shipping to New York State thousands of snowshoe rabbits for restocking purpose.  It was in this way he...gained the experience upon which this book is based\\" (Abercrombie & Fitch, 1967).<br /><br />Perhaps his snowshoe experience was derived from live-trapping, but an obvious fair amount of time must have been spent in the wilderness, submerged in nature, noting every minute aspect of dozens of animal and flora species, as well as studying the soil, erosion, wind and water, and weather, and the interrelated balance of life and death: the fundamental basics of ecology and biology.  In short, Grange was a genius with nature.  It is perhaps a shame he gave us only one book, but he departed the world leaving the state of Wisconsin a 9470-acre wildlife haven, among other accomplishments.<br /><br />The book opens on a dreary night, one filled with wind and snow and darkness.  Enough to drive any animal into the recesses of underbrush for shelter, huddled for warmth.  Should we feel sorry for these creatures of the winter?  As Grange exposes the world to us, he is possibly provoking that instinctual human reaction: sympathetic sorrow.  One quickly learns to disregard these feelings and allow Grange to re-introduce us to a world that can, and does, take care of itself.<br /><br />There are no humans in this book.  The dreaded \\"hunt\\" does not come from modern weaponry.  It comes from the root of life: survival.  There is no intellectual within this story.  Snowshoe et al. do not band together and fight the ever-evil wolves and hawks.  The rabbit is a rabbit.  And Grange goes about describing what the rabbit knows as a simple thought process, one so realistic, the reader will begin to understand the rabbit for who he is, and who he isn't.  At one point, Grange brings up a curiosity regarding the brain:<br /><br />Lepus [a rabbit], as a mammal, has the power of motion; memory; sight; hearing-and he has a brain.  But where is the brain of the jackpine or of the pitcher plant?  How shall it be that plants, apparently not possessed of any central nervous system, nevertheless grow, have species identity, sex, inheritance, habit, preference; that they compete with one another; struggle, have natural enemies...and the will to live? (161)<br /><br />The book begins in winter, and takes us through the four seasons.  Grange shows us the interrelatedness of weather patterns, migration patterns of species (those that pass through the rabbits' little world), and how each creature manages to survive one moment to the next.  Grange's style (as seen in the above paragraph) comprises of reflective questions, posed to bring the reader to an awareness of certain natural elements he may have never thought of before.  Simply, why are things the way they are?  The author will often delve into the surprisingly scientific route to answer some of these questions.<br /><br />Grange also fills Those of the Forest with page-long glances at different critters or plant-life or even components of the weather.  One of my personal favorites concerns the firefly:<br /><br />Now, in the darkness of each night, it is almost as though a million stars scatter luminous fragments of themselves to float and drift elusively...For who shall explain the firefly?  Has a beetle the need for a lantern?...Is the strange light of the small creature an aid to mating?  Then why do some firefly larvae-and even eggs-also glow? (129)<br /><br />In this poetic book, you will find, and learn about, elements regarding the hawk, the grouse, the snow, the rain, the birch, the jackpine...\\"[t]hose of the forest-its living things, its rocks, its chemicals, its sky, its untold billions of stars in the firmament; all its materials, processes and laws...\\" (164).<br /><br />And while the first 3/4 of the book is a look at Snowshoe, his life, his family of rabbits, and the natural world around them, the last 1/4 of the book takes a fantastic turn.  The subject is temporarily replaced by Ancient Rabbit who takes the reader on a journey spanning 500 million years.  Grange will show you the rabbits' world as it is carved by glaciers and Ice Ages, the struggle of many different forests, the geologic history, the introduction of life, forest fires, and rabbits, leading up literally to Snowshoe's world.<br /><br />As Georgius Agricola's De Re Metallica is essential reading for the contemporary miner, so is this book, Those of the Forest, essential reading for the contemporary soul.  Let Grange's words embody your spirit and love for nature.  Those of the Forest is one of the most beautiful books ever written.things, its rocks, its chemicals, its sky, its untold billions of stars in the firmament; all its materials, processes and laws...\\" (164).

US	23329350	R2N1YGVCNJAGSA	0553560735	710568866	Red Mars (Mars Trilogy)	Books	4	2	6	N	N	Between the Black and the Red	Red Mars, at its very core, is not for the weak minded.  Each book is a huge undertaking, fraught with slowly-paced character development, minutely detailed landscapes that read like geological poetry, and political discussions and long-winded speeches that would make any man reconsider his abstinence from drink.<br /><br />I've read the book two times.  The first time I think I was a bit too young to follow exactly what was going on.  The second time I was able to appreciate the science much more.<br /><br />Red Mars is a dark book.  In it you will find a murder that haunts the whole trilogy.  There is jealousy, greed, backstabbing, and friendships gained and lost. Kim Stanley Robinson throws his characters into a variety of situations that are both unpleasant (exploding tents that shelter cities resulting in massive decompression) and awe-inspiring.  One of my favorite little moments is when everyone has gathered on Olympus to witness the first attempt at thickening the atmosphere.  The whole description of the meteor exploding takes up less than two pages.  But I'll never forget the last sentence. (See page 377 of paperback.)<br /><br />Robinson writes with a dry pen, which fits the arid atmospheres of the red planet.  It's a style that takes some getting used to, especially since this was my first book of his.<br /><br />Why read Red Mars?  Besides having attained a somewhat cult-status among space aficionados, Red Mars is the story of what could very well happen in the not-too-far future.  100 people are sent to Mars.  Earth almost disowns them, then struggles to re-control them.  And by the time you reach the third book, Blue Mars, what people are alive turn around and help Earth which has its own rather intriguing problems.<br /><br />While I would consider the trilogy an epic, the first book isn't as intimate as Green Mars.  There seems to be a distance to the characters, perhaps overshadowed by all the political thought-processes regarding terraforming an entire planet.	2005-03-10
US	23329350	RN7YVXCBP0PB1	0810948249	63175754	The Boy Who Couldn't Die	Books	4	6	7	N	N	A Short Tale About Death and the Lack Thereof	I haven't read a Sleator book in decades, and I thought it would be fun to pick up a copy of his latest work.  I am older with a lot more reading experience than I used to have, so I was aware of what I was getting into: Young Adult fiction.  The writing would be unsophisticated, the tale slow in pace, etc.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong!  Sleator writes as well as I remember, throwing in larger, everyday-sort of words that will improve a young reader's vocabulary.  There isn't enough room in a short book to expand character development into something deep, but that's okay.  Sleator does a great job of keeping our hero down-to-earth, funny, and even romantic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, our hero also falls into a breed of characters that I am finding more frequently in today's books: wealthy.  Like Stephen Coonts's \\"Saucer\\" books, the main character can essentially afford anything he wants.  This ultimately gives a 16 year old the ability to have an adventure typical of an adult.  But without this adventure, there would be no book.<br /><br />Sleator's writing is incredible and straight-forward.  And what a coincidence: chapter 13 is one of the most tense and frightening in the book, and I made the mistake of reading it at 3 in the morning.  And I had to go to the restroom and was a little anxious about walking around in the dark, to say the least.<br /><br />This means one thing: Sleator can write a very frightening book if he wanted to, one that keeps the suspense above \\"unbearable\\" for any length of time.  I hope in the future he writes a larger story for his adult fans.	2005-03-03

I received this book for Christmas from my parents who got my hints that I like to look at nature a little more closely than most other people.  By no means am I a great bird-watcher, but I'm definitely working on improving!<br /><br />While this guide to Western N.America may not be the honkin' encyclopedia other people want to sift through, this book makes for a great excursion guide, a quick way to look birds up.  I am, at the moment, in possession of three other bird books, including the Audubon guide.  Some have actual photographs, others have different charts.  I can't say how often I actually refer to Sibley's in the end.  It's just a more \\"natural\\" book to flip though.<br /><br />Sibley gives you the basics, here, not extraneous info that weigh down your backpack.  I like to keep track of what I see, and then do further research relaxed at home with a drink.<br /><br />The first 17 pages is the usual fare of introductions to birding,  color recognition, song recognition and learning, maps, and season keys.  The next 7 pages includes a \\"Bird Topography.\\"  I don't know if this is birding lingo or creative writing, but I reference these pages often.  Sibley's fantastic drawings are given black & white, sketch, and enhanced colorized treatments with breakdowns of body and wing parts for several different birds.  Again, as a beginner, these are essential to me.<br /><br />Thereafter are all the birds in the Western N.A. as detailed by Sibley's hands.  Living by the ocean, I have access to a huge variety of birds that I never enjoyed when living in the Rockies.<br /><br />I wouldn't state that the beginner should begin with only this one book.  I found that I learned more about bird recognition by looking at several books.  Every author has something original to say.  But if there is one book to own, it would be Sibley's.<br /><br />Nycticorax!	2005-03-02
US	23329350	R2QB1ONAPKE3ZV	038081093X	604551094	Excavation	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Temples It Could Have Been	Perhaps my expectations for this novel were too high, but I found the formula followed exactly that of \\"Ice Hunt,\\" a book I found superbly well written.  Unfortunately, after reaching the halfway point of \\"Excavation,\\" I found myself reading to finish, not to enjoy.  Same thing: I enjoyed the discoveries, not the fight to get out.<br /><br />I will point out simply a few things:<br /><br />·&#729;&#730;&#729;·° Unlike \\"Ice Hunt,\\" which was well researched and organized, \\"Excavation\\" is full of plotholes.  In fact, it is the first book I have read where I ever noticed a plothole, and then said to myself, \\"Another one,\\" several times over, repeatedly.<br /><br />·&#729;&#730;&#729;·° Poorly thought-out details.  One example, without spoilers: Picture yourself and a friend in a dark room, holding the only lantern, which is a (in this case) bright purple UV light, meant to fluoresce certain minerals.  Now imagine noticing your friend's face is purple in hue, despite the obvious difficulty in distinguishing the color of flesh in a blacklight environment.<br /><br />·&#729;&#730;&#729;·° Some of the scientific stuff is already obsolete merely by the way Mr. Rollins writes about it.  Paradoxically, in a book with so much unbelievably cool stuff, what is real is treated like science-fiction!<br /><br />·&#729;&#730;&#729;·° Conveniences.  I don't like it when a character suddenly realizes the required item is in their back pocket.  I don't like it when this happens five times in one story.<br /><br />I will not continue, because there is one thing this book has that most stories don't: originality.  Although the climax is lacking in many ways, my favorite parts are the discoveries at the beginning and interspersed throughout.  Cool stuff in here.  And the very last chapter has a twist that blew me away and almost made me forgive everything poor about this book.  I just wish Rollins had gotten to it sooner.	2005-03-01

I re-read it several years ago and I remember getting this adrenaline rush surging through me as the story progressed.  It was one of the best young adult books I've ever read.  I would re-read it, but I've since moved from my parents' house, where it's under lock and key.<br /><br />Even if you're a Hardy Boys fan, give this book a whirl.  Help yourself to the first book, too (Terror Castle).  The rest of the series isn't nearly as charming as this one.	2005-02-28

I never thought the author of \\"Flight of the Intruder\\" would ever take me as far as the moon.  This book was quite the adventure, and very believable with where it goes.<br /><br />While the first book had that \\"initial discovery\\" feel about the whole saucer, the sequel doesn't quite hold up.  I was a little concerned because now all the main characters aren't just geniuses, they're *rich* geniuses!  How was I going to relate to any of these guys?!<br /><br />Any review on Amazon will tell you the story.  I just wanted to input that Coonts obviously had a blast writing these two books and it shows.  His blatant pokes at the president are laugh-out-loud hilarious...by far the best scenes in the entire book!<br /><br />Enjoy!	2005-02-27

Was this a sequel to \\"Flight of the Intruder\\"?  It was a dream come true!  However much I liked Coonts' follow-up Grafton novels, they lacked the original book's magic.  And since I'm a sucker for marketing, I thought the cover wasn't half bad either.<br /><br />There are plenty of reviews here that will tell you what the book's about.  Seems to me most people don't care all that much for it.  I wasn't looking for something incredible.  I just wanted young Grafton again, and I got him.  The flying, the power, the wind... I was happy.<br /><br />Ever wonder who does those covers?  In this case, it's Dru Blair who paints aircraft, tanks, helicopters, eagles, and Star Trek book covers of all things!<br /><br />\\"Intruders\\" was commissioned for the cover of this book (sadly his own website gets the title wrong): [...]<br /><br />\\"Intruders\\" was exactly what I was looking for: a fast read, fun, slick, and Coonts as I grew up knowing.	2005-02-27

The first thing that popped into my head: you get your money's worth.  Rollins's book is thick, and took longer for me to get through than most books.  I found this quality intriguing, to say the least, since I almost feel like Rollins isn't leaving any details out.<br /><br />Let me get this out of the way: the title *is* a little awkward and it's since grown on me.  Still, while reading, I always imagined that I would've picked up the book sooner had it been titled with a little more panache.<br /><br />Rollins's characters are built up, with backstories, twists, and realistic physical descriptions, combined to help you actually visualize the character, rather than someone your mind just 'plugs in' until the book is through.<br /><br />***Sort of a Possible Spoiler***<br />My only regret is the second half of the book.  There's just too much ding-dang fighting.  In first half, you have adventure, discovery, characters doing fun things with the ice... but the second half is non-stop accusing, escaping, explosions, weather being bad... if I were an editor, it could've been trimmed 50 pages.<br />*** End Sort of Possible Spoiler***<br /><br />Anyway, this book has me hooked.  I'm including Rollins in my usual fare of annual reads.<br /><br />For a quick additional read, I recommend reading this article on sonar before beginning the book.

Who needs to?  Stephen Coonts is one of those rare authors who doesn't have to take himself seriously.  And he's obviously having a good time writing this book.  I doubt he knew it would be the hit that it is.<br /><br />This book has a little bit of that adventurous youth flavor we all wished we could've chanced upon in our past, or at least I did anyway.  It's exhilarating to see how the saucer is handled, and some of the technical ideas about it are pretty spiffy.<br /><br />I dropped off one star because nearly every character in this book is a genius at something.  This sort of increases the distance between reader and subject matter.  Unless you're a genius, you won't relate that well to these characters.  And if you're a genius, you probably won't be reading this book anyway.  You'd be finishing translating De Re Metallica from Zimbabwe back into Latin as something to do on a Monday night.<br /><br />History time: I grew up reading the Jake Grafton novels, but as I grew up, so did my interests and I stopped reading Coonts after The Intruders (skipping The Red Horseman)... and haven't touched him since.  Not his fault, I have different tastes.

It's my fifth, and I am also not a complete trekkie.  I like the series enough, and I love the books.<br /><br />Mr. Vornholt, unfortunately, writes a book that is poorly written.  The characters are individual enough, but their reactions are all flat.<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />For example, there is a scene in which a klingon finds out how to survive the wave.  His reaction: oh really? then he changes the subject.<br /><br />*end spoiler*<br /><br />Sorry, but if I learned that information, I'd go berserk and try to talk about the issues, not change subjects.<br /><br />Mr. Vornholt infuses the book with \\"Yes, Sir\\" everywhere.  I couldn't stand it!  Not to sound narrow, but this is one little pet-peeve of mine.  In the series, they never said Yes, Sir as often as this, and if it's written, I doubt it's written with a capital S every time!!!  It was one thing that completely annoyed me.  Yes, Sir.  Like two sentences trying to start at the same time.<br /><br />The book is slow and Chapter 14 could have been condensed, truncated, anything.  I forced myself to read it so I could say I read the book entirely.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed and will not be continuing the series.  And if no one believes me (this is *not* a fast-paced thriller like everyone claims), take a good look at the summary on the 1st edition hardcover: Book 1 of two books.<br /><br />Mr. Vornholt is up to four books now.  The man knows how to take your money and give you nothing.<br /><br />In praise: while many of the NG characters do not act as they would in a Peter David book, the twists are actually pretty fun.<br /><br />To conclude: These twists occur in the last ten pages of the book.  Good luck.	2005-02-22

And it shows.<br /><br />(He writes he's been reading about environmental issues for three years, p 569.  Include the amount of time to write a 600 page novel, and I doubt Mr. Crichton had a vacation between these books!)<br /><br />I do not read nearly enough to know if Crichton's method of writing is groundbreaking, and if he has invented a new genre (informant thriller?), but the incorporation of heavily researched facts and figures and then giving credit where it's due, both in a thick bibliography and in footnotes, is something I hope all future authors begin incorporating into their books.<br /><br />I found myself piqued at the ideas presented in this book, and should I want to indulge myself with further research, now I know what the author has read, quoted or paraphrased, and I can look further down my own paths (which I've already begun with the American West theme...no spoilers here, though).<br /><br />I think enough has been said on these pages about the book itself, the novel and the research, so I won't press the issue (people love it or hate it).  But you can't say you've read the book until you've read the bibliography.  Crichton incorporates his own mini-summaries, ideas, and, along with Appendix I (which is a short essay in its own right), Crichton is convincing, and crystal clear.<br /><br />I recommend peeking at what he has written about Brian Levack, Robert A. J. Matthews, and his own amusing inclusion of an episode of Penn & Teller's Showtime series.<br /><br />James Rollin's \\"Ice Hunt\\" has a little note at the end in which Mr. Rollins assists the reader with separating fact from fiction.  Mr. Crichton includes an Author's Message at the end that is five pages long, is laugh-out-loud funny in places, and written in a humble manner, that not only separates fact from fiction in his book, but firmly presses the issue: We do not know enough.<br /><br />Enough for what, you may ask?  Read the book.  This is by far the most engaging book he has written, although I must say I won't ever forget \\"Jurassic Park.\\"<br /><br />Speaking of JP, I wish he had presented his research in that book as well!

Of course, this made me look a little strange when I showed up at work.<br /><br />When taking on a book of this size that is this good (and therein lies the catch), it becomes a part of your life.  Some of the characters will remind you of people you know and bring them more to life, but already Dumas' characters are so lifelike and incredibly, amazingly real, and that with each chapter you have spent that much more time with them, learning something new about them (up to the very last chapter!), the story literally becomes a memory that you will be fond of looking back on.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that this translation is from an anonymous person.  I had several issues with the translation unfortunately.  I feel it was completed by at least two people, and I believe one can tell (in the first half of the book) because the chapters are clumped together in specific styles.  It probably won't affect many readers, but I noticed it and thought I should point it out.  This edition, unfortunately, has typos!  Beware, that though they are sparse, they are blatant.  This saddens me when I see a beautiful edition slighted by the hands of lazy-eyed editors.  (I expect no less for modern authors!)<br /><br />I have waited years to read this.  I would have loved to have read this when I was younger, but a lot of it would have gone in one eye, out the other (so to speak).<br /><br />Enjoy, and let the story take you away from this life for awhile.	2004-02-04
