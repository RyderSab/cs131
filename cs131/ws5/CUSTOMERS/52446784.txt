It can give a good overview of network security, and enough information on the FireWall, VPN, AAA, Intrusion Detection. It provides enough examples to illustrate the idea, especially for those commands usage. Don't expect this book can give you much in-depth information on all areas, such as network security design, but still can give you an overview and enough information for beginner to intermediate level.	2001-01-07

It can give you a good explanation on the VLAN, especially the explanation on the product. You can get much information on Catalyst 5000/5500 series, 3000 series etc. That is the main point you should buy it.	2000-12-17

This book is concise and hits the point directly. It fits the syllabus of the exam. Moreover, it contains enough information about the OSPF, EIGRP and BGP. The Glossary is also good, you can have a quick look of the key words before taking the exam. Also, I can accept the writing style of the book. However, I think it contains not enough practice questions, and the questions are quite fit, but not very fit with the real exam. Anyway, it is indeed a good book for experienced people. But if you are not experienced, then you may find that it is not enough to pass the exam, you may need to buy a study guide and download materials from Cisco web site.	2000-11-06

There are many diagrams and examples that can help you to understand the concepts. I would appreciate the last chapter, it gives some scenario to show the concepts and configuration for the final preparation. However, I think it would be better if the book contains more information about routing protocols. And this book is a little bit wordy, I would like it is straightforward and hits the point directly. The last thing is that there are some error in this version, it is better to download correct one from ciscopress.	2000-10-25

Although, this part does not talked in-depth, it can still give me a  valuable concept about it.<br />The content is abundant. I am pleased that it  organized in a good way. Most likely, make one chapter for each protocol. I  can follow it easily.<br />Also, it is also good in glossary and index. I  think index is quite important for you, since I can find what I want  quickly.<br />Any, it is a good book indeed.	2000-05-01

First, the network basic knowledge, then pre-design procedure,  designing procedure, post-design procedure. Especially on the topic of  network management, routing protocols, the author does a good job.

I would treat it as revision book. I spend about two hours on re-reading this book before going to take the exam. It can refresh me all the key point, all the important notes in CCNA exam. If  you just use this book for your exam, I think it is not 100% to ensure you  can pass, so I use it with another study guide also by Todd Lammle. I would  also like the part of &quot;Exam Essentials&quot; that can let you know  what are the CCNA exam emphasize on, so that you can pay more attention on  them. All parts of the content are good enough to let you pass, eg. IOS,  LAN switch etc. But the materials about WAN is not good enough actually,  even I have read the study guide(not this exam notes), I still cannot 100%  handle all the questions about WAN, eg. sth about ISDN, Frame Relay etc.  You may need other materials for supplement(I get 75% on WAN  protocols).<br />Anyway, it is a good book	2000-02-17

The questions are quite fit to the actual exams. I think it does a good job on core exam, but in Dos/Win parts, it does not broad enough to cover this  part.<br />However, I still give it five stars because I get passed with this  book and another text book.	1999-10-15
