President Abraham Lincoln, his wife Mary and family would journey to the Soldiers Retirement Home about 4 miles from the White House. Son Robert would visit on his trips home from Harvard. Youngest Lincoln son Tad enjoyed the Soldiers' Home where he had a menagerie of pets; got to know the guard troops from Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio stationed there. Wife Mary was often vacationing in New England or shopping in New York.<br /><br />  In this atmosphere Lincoln enjoyed the camaraderie of soldiers; received visitors and enjoyed the company of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton living in a nearby cottage.<br /><br />  It was in this location that the President agonized over his decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation; decided to fire<br /><br />George B. McClellan and help plan the 1864 presidential campaign.<br /><br />  Every day Lincoln would ride a horse to the White House surrounded by mounted cavalryman. His wife Mary fell from her carriage in July, 1863 while traveling to the home. She was seriously injured .<br /><br />  Pinsker tells us of plots against Lincoln's life. He may have even been fired upon by an unknown assassin according to a soldier who reported this incident in his postwar memoirs.<br /><br />  Matthew Pinsker has written an outstanding book adding to our knowledge of the heretofore little known Lincoln residence at the Soldiers Home. The Home is now a National Landmark and is being renovated and opened for the public. One can imagine how awed poet Walt Whitman was as he saw Lincoln on his daily ride from the White House to the Soldiers Home.<br /><br />  Pinsker draws on a vast array of first person accounts, letters,memoirs and can be complimented on adding to our knowledge of the Lincoln presidency.<br /><br />  The book is well illustated with maps and is an outstanding addition to anyone interested in the Civil War and the Lincoln presidency.

Dr. Gottfried Wagner (born in 1947) is the great-grandson of German's greatest opera composer Richard Wagner (1813-1883). The famed composer is known as a titan among the operatic deities as<br /><br />he lived, worked, womanized and whined his way across Europe. Wanger wrote such works as \\"The Ring Cycle\\"; \\"The Flying Dutchman\\" \\"Parisfal\\" \\"Lohengrin\\"; \\"Tannheuser\\" and \\"The Meistersingers von Nurumberg.\\"<br /><br />  The composer was also noted for his adultery; his ingratitude to friends and supporters; his hedonism and crack-pot anti-semitic philosophy.<br /><br />  Gottfried's book sketchily fills in the portraits of the Wanger family. We see how the family worshipped Hitler, supported him with money, publicity and unwavering loyalty during the dark days of the Third Reich.<br /><br />  Gottfired grew up in a cold, anti-semetic hermetically sealed world of loyalty to the deity Richard Wagner. His father was an especially cold man who (according to Gottfried) treated the young Wagner as a pariah<br /><br />  Despite a PH.D and vast experience on the stages of European opera houses, lecture podiums and theatre young Wagner is still not welcomed at the Bayreuth Festipial House. He has an expert's<br /><br />knowledge of the works of Brech at Weill which are not appreciated in his family!<br /><br />  Young Wagner is wed to an Italian and has several years ago adopted a boy from the brutal land of Romania. He seeks to be engaged in dialogue with Jews and all who have suffered oppression. His guilt at being a German child of Nazi sympathizers and active supporters is manifest throughout these tortured and self-revealing pages.<br /><br />  The book should have been better edited for conciseness! Gottfried does tend to whine, complain and seek to force his imperious will on others ! (could this be a Wagner trait?). I would also like to learn how other members of the family feel about it and what justifications could they render for their actions.<br /><br />  The book is a tedious, relatively boring book. It offers little for the music lover interested in learning more about Richard Wagner and the nineteenth century world in which he lived and composed.<br /><br />  While I applaud the author's disdain of anti-semitism I wish I had saved my money is this draggy read!  So-So!ffers little for the music lover interested in learning more about Richard Wagner and the nineteenth century world in which he lived and composed. <br />  While I applaud the author's disdain of anti-semitism I wish I had saved my money is this draggy read!

Clemens) was born in Florida Missouri in 1835 to John Marshall Clemens and his good wife Jane. Clemens grew up in Hannibal up the river from St. Louis. Times were hard on the hardscrabble frontier. His father tried many professions from Law to various failed busines ventures never succeeding in<br /><br />any of them, His mother raised a large family giving young Clemens love and support throughout her long life.<br /><br />  Clemens was a man who tried many paths to riches. He was a<br /><br />steamboat pilot on the Mississippi learning this trade under the<br /><br />inimitable pilot Horace Bixby. He was a printer,jounralist in Neveda and in California and even served a few weeks as a Confederate Soldier. Twain grew up hard, was complex, profane<br /><br />and eager to get rich. He was also a genius of the written word<br /><br />who wrote such classics as \\"Tom Sawyer\\"; \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" \\"The<br /><br />Prince and the Pauper\\" and several other works. His writing was uneven being weak in plotting but strong on humor and the sage<br /><br />use of accurate dialect. Twain spoke for the common person in the Gilded Age of big money and the power of the giants of industry such as Carneige, Rockerfeller, Gould and JP Morgan.<br /><br />  Twain married the wealthy Olivia Langdon living in luxury in<br /><br />a succesion of homes in Buffalo, Elmira NY and most notably in<br /><br />Hartford, Conn.<br /><br />  His wife was frail and died at 57. His son died after 19 months of life. His oldest daughter Susy and youngest daughter<br /><br />Jean predeceased him. Only his middle daughter Clara outlived<br /><br />Twain who died in 1910.<br /><br />  Twain is known for his humor but was a religious skeptic with<br /><br />a dark vision of humanity. His cynicism, anti-imperialism and<br /><br />bad temper are rarely mentioned or known among the general public.<br /><br />  Reading this book is a wondeerful insight into the peripatetic<br /><br />lecturer Twain as he and his family traveled thousands of miles<br /><br />on tours living in Europe for years to avoid bills and generally<br /><br />knowing everyone worth knowing in the nineteenth century world of politics, literature and the arts. Twain's friendship with<br /><br />US Grant seeing to the publication of his memoirs is a moving<br /><br />story. His petty jealousies and mistreatment of his older brother<br /><br />Orion is not pretty.<br /><br />  Twain's deepest friendship was with fellow midwesterner William Dean Howells who edited the Atlantic, Cosmoplitan and<br /><br />also was a famous author of such classics as \\"The Rise of Silas<br /><br />Lapham.<br /><br />  Twain was a complex and often difficult man who could be rude<br /><br />and ungracious. His foolish quest for weath led him to invest and lose fortunes especially in his backing of the Paige typesetter.<br /><br />  He had many admirable traits such as his deep love for his family and friends.

Consider:<br /><br />1. He portrayed macho cowboys and military leaders in the movies but never served in World War II (which caused him a good deal of guilt in later years.)<br /><br />2. He was an advocate for strong family life (including strong<br /><br />male bonding with his friends) but was wed three times and<br /><br />had several affairs.<br /><br />3. He enjoyed drink, good food and profane activities with his buddies Ward Bond and director John Ford but was noted for his<br /><br />strong he-man appearance (he was 6'4' tall and at one time weighed over 260 pounds.)<br /><br />4. He was at one time a member of the John Birch Society and<br /><br />supported the right wing during the McCarthy era but could also<br /><br />express individuality in politics (he supported LBJ and was a<br /><br />friend of Jimmy Carter). He resigned from the Birchers and was<br /><br />a man who valued America freedom. He was constantly having money troubles with the IRS and disdained (loathed!) big government.<br /><br />5. He believed in God but did not become a member of an organized religion until converting to Roman Catholicism on his deathbed),<br /><br />6. He was a good but often absent father to his seven children.<br /><br />7. He was well read and memorized his lines quickly.<br /><br />8. He was an excellent actor who finally won his Best Actor Oscar for \\"True Grit.\\"<br /><br />  Randy Roberts and James Olson have told \\"Duke's story from<br /><br />his life in middle class Iowa and Glendale (his parents despised one another and later divorced)to football player at USC to work<br /><br />in the movies.<br /><br />  Wayne's first film was a flop and for almost ten years he labored in the B Western factory in such minor studios as Republic and Monogram.

Details of the biographies of the composeers<br /><br />2. A knowledge of what the political and social mileu was in<br /><br />which the artist worked.

Gieguld was<br /><br />complex with many aspects to his character.<br /><br />  Gielgud was a superb actor of such great Shakespearean roles<br /><br />as Hamlet, Romeo and Richard III. In later years he was noted for cameos in films (some of the movies were horrid!) winning a<br /><br />best supporting actor Oscar for his turn in \\"Arthur\\" with Dudly<br /><br />Moore. Along with such British acting legends as Olivier, Guiness, Olivier and Peggy Ashcroft he has brought culture to<br /><br />millions. His resonant and musical voice will live as long as<br /><br />there is recorded sound. No wonder a theatre in London has been<br /><br />named \\"The Gielgud Theatre.\\" No wonder he was knighted in 1953.<br /><br />No wonder the many books he wrote have been bestsellers. He was<br /><br />witty and well traveled. I was tired after learning of all the<br /><br />climes, times and theatres upon whose boards this seven league<br /><br />booted vagabond traveled in his long career (He came from the<br /><br />great Terry acting family and was a born actor!).<br /><br />  Sir John was openly gay. He had a succession of male lovers<br /><br />throughout his life. In 1953 he was briefly arrrested for solicitation in a public place causing a minor scandal.<br /><br />  Gielgud was prickly and often condescending to folks from the<br /><br />provinces. He was wont to make snide remarks about Jews and people of color. He was a narcissist who worship himself and his<br /><br />career though he was at the same time a good and loyal friend.<br /><br />While at times catty and meanspirited he could also be generous<br /><br />to others.<br /><br />  I find Gielgud to be a better actor than a man. This book will be boring to anyone not familiar with the actors of an earlier time. It is revealing of a person a theatre/film buff should be<br /><br />acquainted with in an understanding of 20th century things thespian.a theatre/film buff should be <br />acquainted with in an understanding of 20th century things thespian. <br />	2005-09-07

Like most Civil War buffs my shelves<br /><br />teem with big volumes on the Army of Northern Virginia but lack<br /><br />good histories of the Army of the Potomac!<br /><br />  Beatie's series is sure to be come the sine qua non for anyone wanting an in depth study of this much maligned but eventually magnificent sword of Lincoln.<br /><br />  Beatie's is a writer more interested in the political and<br /><br />strategical thinking of war leaders in Washington than he is in<br /><br />blow by blow descriptions of battle. In this second volumen in the series he does discuss in depth the battle of Ball's Bluff<br /><br />fought on on Oct. 21, 1861 in which Lincoln's old law partner<br /><br />the inept Edward Baker died. Beatie explores the impact of this<br /><br />small battle on the competency of Union leaders; how it helpedfoment the call for a Committee on the Conduct of the War led<br /><br />by Radical Republicans such as Benjamin Franklin Wade to control the strategy of the War.<br /><br />  Beatie explores how the pool of military commanders was drawn from professional soldiers who graduated from West Point; political generals and those who came from the ranks of volunteer<br /><br />companies mustered in by individaul state governors. He also<br /><br />explores how foreign born leaders came to leadership roles in the<br /><br />army.<br /><br />  Beatie's pen is adept at drawing incisive portraits of Northern leaders such as Winfield Scott; Fitzjohn Porter; Joe<br /><br />Hooker and the star of this book William McClellan. McClellan<br /><br />took the commanding position of union forces following the retirement of old, crusty Winfield Scott.<br /><br />  McClellan could train and equip an army to fight but was slow<br /><br />in launching an assault agains the rebels. His thoughts about<br /><br />launching the Urbanna water assault on Richmond, the Occoquan<br /><br />plan and the Penisular Campaign strategy are explored in depth!<br /><br />  Beatie writes in an adequate style but he lacks the skill of<br /><br />writers such as Foote, Freeman and Catton to entrance the reader<br /><br />with the magic of words.<br /><br />  Maps are adequate.<br /><br />  In addition to the military leaders the author sketches such<br /><br />luminaries as Edwin Stanton (whom he dislikes) and of course the<br /><br />Commander in Chief Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln had to steer the war effort handling with deft genius the Radical Republicans, conservative forces in the army and government, abolitionists<br /><br />and others who disdained his leadership.<br /><br />  The book is dry to read but contains invaluable information on the Army of the Potomac.

Mary Ann<br /><br />was born in the English midlands in a rural, conservative and<br /><br />evangelical society. She became an agnostic, free thinker whose<br /><br />brilliant early works were translations of German scholarship dealing with a critical examination of the life of Jesus.<br /><br />  Eliot had a succesion of love affairs which such literary types as John Chapman editor of the Westminster Review and the<br /><br />brillian but cold Herbert Spencer. Her true love was George<br /><br />Henry Lewes a literary man who never divorced his unfaithful wife Agnes continuing to support her and his children through the long years he spent living with Eliot.<br /><br />  With the encouragement, nurturing care and support of Lewes the fragile, tempermental, moody and gloomy plain girl from the Midlands became the leading light in the intellectual-literary world of mid 19th century London.<br /><br />  Eliot is in the first rank of Victorian novelists.

But what a cost! Lee was never able to replace his fallen warrors. The Southern cause would not receive foreign money and<br /><br />support (the British had banned slavery and would never support a southern slavocracy),<br /><br />  Of all the dozens of books I own on Gettysburg this book is the only one dealing with the retreat. Brown quotes extensively from diaries and memoirs penned by participants in the campaign.<br /><br />His book includes pictures and is well written in a popular style easy to read.<br /><br />  Without a thorough understanding of the retreat the student of the Civil War will never understan the Gettysburg campaign.<br /><br />  Kudos to Brown. One hopes this book will win him a deserved wide readership appealing to Civil War buff as well as the general reader. Excellent work!	2005-07-18

Gallagher has written an outstanding book on the films of John Ford from his primitive Westerns of the silent era through his last film \\"7 Women\\" in 1965.<br /><br />  Gallagher includes biographical information on the enigmatic Mr. Ford-tough guy; closet intellectual; painter of superb movie landscapes and all around genius!<br /><br /> Gallagher's main focus, however, is a close study of all the John Ford movies. His commentary is to be read slowly (a dictionary to look up the abstruse words he likes to use can also prove handy!). Gallagher's writing is often academic (using big words and jargon of film scholars), pedantic and obscure.<br /><br />However, overall he does a good job at getting at the essence of a film's worth. Gallagher helps you to \\"read a Ford film\\" giving you new insights into the neglected genius of the fiery Irishman who made the best American movies of his time.<br /><br />  If you want a biography of John Ford turn to the excellent biographies by Joseph McBride or Scott Eyman among others. If you<br /><br />want primarily a scholary study of the movies made by Ford then<br /><br />Gallagher is for you.<br /><br />  I enjoyed the book and recommend it to fans of Ford or for anyone wishing to know more about this legendary director of such classics as \\"Rio Grande\\"; \\"Fort Apache\\" \\"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\\" \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\"; \\"Drums Along the Mohawk\\"; \\"Young<br /><br />Mr. Lincoln\\"; \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\\" and countless other classics!

Jeffrey Wert's books repose in my Civil War study. His books<br /><br />are always well written in a popular style appealing to general<br /><br />readers. In his new work Wert has done a good job of telling the tale of the Army of the Potomac from its inception in 1861 to its<br /><br />triumph over the Army of Northern Virginia in 1865.<br /><br />  What a story of courage, valor and perseverance. What a tragic tale of carnage on a previously unknown scale! In vivid prose Wert quotes first person accounts written by soldiers who bathed in the blood baths of the battlefields in Virginia, Maryland<br /><br />and Pennsylvania.<br /><br />  The Army of the Potomac was cursed by weak leaders. Consider:<br /><br />1. Irvin McDowell-defeated at First Bull Run. He was not up to the job of wielding Lincoln's sword!<br /><br />2. George B.McClellan-A pompous, ego-centric prima donna who could train and prepare an army. He was no warrior. After the stalemate of Antietam he was replaced. McClellan emerges in these pages as a nemesis to Lincoln who overestimated Confederate troop numbes, was slow and no match for the military genius of Robert E. Lee.<br /><br />3. Ambrose E. Burnside-He failed miserably in command as the<br /><br />debacle of Fredricksburg proves!<br /><br />4. Joseph Hooker-Hooker was a good organizer but he was bested<br /><br />by Lee and Jackson at Chancellorsivlle.<br /><br />5. George Meade-This snapping turtle grouch but competent General won at Gettysburg but his pursuit of Lee was poor.<br /><br />6. US Grant-One imagines if Grant had commanded in the Eastern theatre from day one! Grant won the war as his blue clad ribbon of cold steel rolled through the sanguinary battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, the Petersburg siege, the<br /><br />Crater and ultimate victory at Appomattox. Grant was a great general who never quit until his sword destroyed the army of Lee,<br /><br />  The picture of the Army of the Potomac limned by Wert is that of a brave, well equipped, patriotic army led by many incompetent commanders. Infighting among the brass and political interference in Washington DC also hampered the effective of the<br /><br />Army of the Potomac.<br /><br />  On Wert's work:<br /><br />1. This is a good volume for the novice to Civil War study. Wert<br /><br />explains all of the major campaigns fought on the eastern front in a clear, easy to understand style. Many veteran Civil War<br /><br />buffs will say this information is \\"old hat to me\\". It is still<br /><br />interesting and a good way to brush up on the personalities and<br /><br />battles fought in the east.<br /><br />2. The volume has good pictures and adequate maps.<br /><br />3. The best part of the book for this reviewer was the quotes<br /><br />(often colorful and profane!) written by the soldiers in blue<br /><br />during their long odyssey from Bull Run to Appomattox Court House.<br /><br />4. Anyone interested in the Civil War will profit by a day or two spent in Wert's company. I read the book in two days being<br /><br />riveted by the often told but always fascinating story of this<br /><br />star crossed but ultimately victorious army.<br /><br />5.Wert has done his homework as page after page of primary sources in the extensive bibliograpy will prove to the reader.<br /><br />6.

It was the most decisive battle in the nine month struggle by Union forces under the command of US Grant to<br /><br />win control of the mighty Mississippi, seize Vicksburg and defeat the army of Northern born Confederate Commander John<br /><br />Pemberto. This longest and in many ways most interesting to study of Civil War campaigns pitted a genius in Grant against the inept paper pushing Pemberton.<br /><br />  The Confederates had emerged from \\"The Gibralter of The West\\"<br /><br />(as Vicksburg was called) to link up with Joe Johnston's force<br /><br />moving westward from Jackson (which had already been seized by<br /><br />the Yankees).<br /><br />  The long day of battle led to overwhelming Federal victory as the blue wave beat ever closer to the Vicksburg rampart. When<br /><br />Grant won at Champion Hill he moved forward defeating Confederate forces at the Big Black River. After two assaults on Vicksburg (May 19 &22) the Federals at last conquered the city after a 47 day seige. As Abraham Lincoln succincty stated \\"The Father of the Waters again flows unvexed to the sea.\\"<br /><br /> The victories at Gettysburg in the East and Vicksburg in the West turned the tide for the Union as the reality of Confederate defeat became only a matter of time.<br /><br />  Smith has studied this battle since his Miss. childhood; he<br /><br />has walked the Champion Hill battlefield with such giants of Civil War historical scholarship as Mr Civil War Ed Bearss. and<br /><br />Vicksburg National Park Chief Historian Terry Winschel. Smith has a Ph.d in History but also knows how to write like a novelist telling an excting tale of courage and brave men fighting and dying for a cause in which they believed.<br /><br />  A microhistory approach coupled with great situational maps of the actions by T. Savas make the battle come alive for the 21st century reader. Be warned that this is strictly a battle history with little commentary on the political and social scene surrounded the battlefield action (as Smith himself notes in his preface),<br /><br />  For those of us who are hardcore Civil War buffs I relished the information gained on a battle for which I knew nothing!<br /><br />  It was very helpful to have thumbnail biographies of the chief participants in the battle so the armchair warrior did not<br /><br />have to hasten to the shelf for Generals in Blue and Generals in Grey by the redoubtable Ezra Warner!<br /><br />  This book would be an outstanding resource if one was fortunate enough to trod the hallowed ground of Champion Hill in person!<br /><br />  The conflict fought on Sid Champion's Mississippi hill was a key in advancing the career of General US Grant (victor of Henry Donelson and Shiloh) leading to his growing popularity with the northern public, his command at Chattanooga; his defeat of Lee in the overland campaign culminating in victory at Appommatox and a trip to a two term Presidency of the US.<br /><br />  Excellent first person resources were used and many quotes are used througout the books as are photographs of the soldiers who led and those who bled.<br /><br />  This book is for those who enjoy blow by blow battle accounts.<br /><br />With that caveat to the reader I strongly recommend it. This<br /><br />book will become a classic as the years roll by and the quiet at<br /><br />Champion Hill speaks in quiet mourning of those who lie there in the bivouac of the dead.

Ballard has had good mentors in his study of the Mississippi River City which fell to US Grant in July, 1863<br /><br />He is has been guided by Terry Wenschel the National Park Chief Historian; read the massive three volume work by Mr. Civil<br /><br />War Ed Bearss on the campaign and is a lifelong native of Mississipi who has visited Vicksburg since his youth.<br /><br />  Vicksburg was a complex campaign pitting the inept Northern Born Confederate General John Pemberton against the aggressive and brilliant US Grant. Grant's Union Army worked well as a team.<br /><br />Even though Grant did not like McClernand he used him well in launching the blue horde against the city on the bluffs. Grant<br /><br />worked well with Sherman and McPherson, Logan and others as they tried many ideas to conquer Vicksburg. Grant and David Dixon Porter worked well on coordinating army-navy operations.<br /><br />  Grant succeeded when his forces crossed the Mississippi to<br /><br />Bruinsburg, Ms. Union victories at Port Gibson, Jackson and<br /><br />most importantly Champion Hill (May 16, 1863) led to a 47 day<br /><br />siege of Vicksburg which fell to Federal forces on July 4, 1863<br /><br />Vicksburge the key to victory in the Western Theatre was then<br /><br />put into Mr. Lincoln's pocket. The fate of the Western Confederacy was sealed.<br /><br />  I am surprised how little many Civil War buffs seem to know little about the Western Theatre of the War. Those whose approach has been \\"Virginia-centric\\" will find much to explore as they gaze at the Western Theatre.<br /><br />  Grant emerges as a tough, imaginative, never say never commander while the Confederates Pemberton and Joe Johnston wee weak and indecisive leaders. Grant's star rose in the West as Lincoln discovered the man who could beat Lee and win the war!<br /><br />  Ballard's book is well illustrated; the maps are clear and<br /><br />easy to follow. Ballard has done his homework as the many pages of bibliography attest to his acumen. While dealing with the battles he also quotes the thoughts of civilians of Vicksburg and Misssippi who saw their society rent asunder by the blue<br /><br />hordes from the north.<br /><br />  Ed Bearss is still the dean of Vicksburg scholars but Michael Ballard has also contributed greatly to our understanding of this vital, complex, too often overlooked campaign.

Years pass but still no one has matched Douglas Southall Freeman for a biography on the Father of our nation. Freeman was the dean of Southern historians winning many awards (including the Pulitzer Prize) for his unsurpassed life of RE Lee in 4 volumes; Lee's Lieutenants in 3 volumes and 7 volumes on the life of Washington (he died before he completed this overwhelming project!)<br /><br />  Richard Harwell abridges the work as he has also done on Freeman's volumes on Lee. Overall he has done an excellent job.<br /><br />I do wish the book had included more maps to follow the battle action.<br /><br />  Many of the sections of the book will seem dry. Freeman's work<br /><br />is basically a military history as he rarely comments on the social scene in colonial and early America.<br /><br />  While not williing to spend time with Freeman through his seven volumes on Washington I found this one volume work to be<br /><br />essential in my understanding of Washington.<br /><br />  Washington was a man who loved duty, honor and country. He was<br /><br />honest and ambitious. Frugal Washington never gave up on American independence. He was kind and though somewhat aloof could also be there for his friends and nation when in need.<br /><br />No wonder he and Lincoln are always at the top of presidential polls.<br /><br />  In this sober work of scholarship you will meet a great man and enjoy the words of a great scholar.

Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) is remembered for his \\"Sinners<br /><br />in the Hands of An Angry God\\" and is the greatest Calvinist<br /><br />theologian in American religious history. As a Presbyterian pastor I consider this book to be required reading for an understanding of the Puritan mind in colonial America. Edward's<br /><br />insistence on the sovereignity of God; his power and love for his erring children is a message profitable to Christians in this age when sinners, seekers and sundry non-saints are seeking for faith,<br /><br />  Marsden's biography is anything but dry, dusty and cluttered with littered footnotes! The Bancroft Prize winner is adept at<br /><br />setting Edwards in the partriarchal culture of his day. Edwards was a frail, thin genius who spent most of his day in deep study of scripture. The Yale educated Edwards was served with love by his wife (the mother of 11 children!) and close family friends.<br /><br />His life was relatively uneventful marred by his pulpit dismissal from Northampton. Edwards served as a missionary to the native Americans in his region ending life as the President of Princeton.<br /><br />  Marsden's great biography reads like a novel. Edwards believed in slavery; was a Calvinist to the core and engaged in many<br /><br />theological battles. He was what was called a \\"New Light' pastor<br /><br />supporting evanglistic outreach through revivals. Edwards was a good friend of the famed evangelist George Whitefield.<br /><br />  Edwards was interested in everything from natural philosophy<br /><br />(especially spiders) to abstruse theology. He was an outstanding<br /><br />Christian whom every Reformed Pastor should come to know.<br /><br />  Marsden is a wonderful master of prose. In his pages Jonathan<br /><br />Edwards lives in his eighteenth century world. In reading this<br /><br />book the reader will be transported back to a time and place much different that our 21st century multicultured society.<br /><br />  If one wants to understand the genesis of evangelical Christianity this is a great place to begin. An excellent book!a great place to begin. An excellent book!	2005-06-13

Through his diplomacy; ability to win social cachet in haughty aristocratic Paris and his foxy skills at wheedling favor with Louis XVI and the foreign minister of France Vergennes this founding father brought bucks to America during the \\"times that try men's souls.\\"<br /><br />  Schiff's prose sparkles as she delves into the details of Anglo French diplomatic complexities as Ben Franklin old, ill and at times very crotchety won France's money, soldiers and shipping to the side of the new nation.<br /><br />  Schiff has excellent commentary on such luminaries as ambassador John Adams who had a difficult time with Franklin;<br /><br />the slippery Silas Deane; the Franklin hating Lee brothers from<br /><br />Virginia and the man who succeeded Franklin in his position one<br /><br />Thomas Jefferson. These were complex individual who often quarreled and quibbled during their stay in Paris.<br /><br />  Franklin loved France and Frenchwomen like Madame Helvetius and Madame Brillon made his visits to their lavish homes a time for the old diplomat to relax from the diplomatic wars at Versailles.<br /><br />  Schiff's book will not be everyone's cup of tea. Her story demands close attention appealing to those who find the story of America's birth fascinating as the diplomatic and Machiavellian story of how we won France as a powerful ally is told in great<br /><br />detail.<br /><br />  This book will never be as popular as McCullough's 1776 which is a more exciting history of Revolutionary battles but the diplomatic battles were equally important. Schiff, therefore, deserves to be read. Anyone wishing a better understanding of Benjamin Franklin should enjoy the book.<br /><br />  While dry at times I found it to be a profitable read.	2005-06-08

You will meet the pantheon of MGM stars<br /><br />from Garbo, Gable, McDonald, Garland, Rooney, Montgomery, Loy,<br /><br />Powell, Crawford and Garson (and a cast too numerous to mention).<br /><br />  One caveat about fans wanting the scoop on stars should be voiced-in many Hollywood books the author usually takes several pages to explain in detail how movie deals were financed and<br /><br />distributed.

Hawks was born into relative luxury in Goshen, Indiana. He was raised<br /><br />in Pasedena, graduated with an engineering degree from Cornell,<br /><br />served briefly in World War I and rose to directorial fame in<br /><br />silent film.<br /><br />  Hawks wed three times. Wife one was Athole the daughter of<br /><br />the lovely and nice Norma Shearer. His second wife \\"Slim\\"was a<br /><br />social climbing fashion plate whose nickname was used by Lauren<br /><br />Bacall in To Have and Have Not with Bogey. His third wife Dee<br /><br />was an aspiring actress who wed the older Hawks to achieve a life of comfort. Hawks was a womanizer throughout his life who was unfaithful and often cruel in his dealings with women.<br /><br />Repugnant!<br /><br />  Hawks was also a gambler losing fortunes and also known as a drinker of note matching bourbons with such buddies as William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and Gary Cooper. His closest friend was famed director Victor Fleming the director of Gone With the Wind and other classics.<br /><br />  Why then spend almost 700 pages on this taciturn, egocentric,<br /><br />cruel man? Simply put -the great movies he directed. Hawks is<br /><br />known for such classics as Dawn Patrol; Sergeant York; To Have and Have Not; the Big Sleep. Classic westerns directed by Hawks include Red River with John Wayne and Rio Bravo with the Duke.<br /><br />Sophisticated comedy delivered at torrid rates of dialogue verbniage include His Girl Friday with Cary Grant and Rosalind<br /><br />Russell. Grant also stared in Hawks's Only Angels Have Wings<br /><br />and \\"I Was a Male War Bride\\" with Ann Sheridan. My personal<br /><br />favorite of the great director are \\"To Have and Have Not\\" and<br /><br />\\"The Big Sleep\\" with Bogey and Bacall.<br /><br />  On and on I could go listing the classics making this man's<br /><br />oeuvre impressive; his influence on younger directors and his<br /><br />storytelling skills reasons to celebrate the genius of HWH!<br /><br />  Movie books like this one could be boring to someone who tires of reading countless pages on the making of each movie, the financing of the films and the often legal troubles Hawks engaged in against such powerful moguls as Mayer. Warner and<br /><br />Zanuck.

The story is familiar to us all from MGM's classic 1939<br /><br />film and the classic bock of 1900!<br /><br />  This is the one book every Wizard of Oz fan should own! Michael Patrick Hearn has an excellent biographical essay on Baum and his times, An extensive bibliography of all the works by the proflic Baum include his work as playwright, songwriter,<br /><br />novelist and childrens' writer.<br /><br />  The book is oversized containing the original illustrations by the gifted artist/illustrator William Wallace Denslow. Denslow and Baum had a tumultous business relationship and the<br /><br />history of the publication of the Oz series of books was tortuous.<br /><br />  If you want to read the great American Classic by Baum then by all means enjoy this wonderful volume. The story is as shining as a emerald;as shiny as Dorothy's silver shoes and as<br /><br />everlasting as the love and comradeship that is the warp and woof of Baum's magical storytelling!<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-04-16

I would imagine the Australian lady would do quite well!<br /><br />Her research is well done as she unfolds for the reader the last years of the Roman Republic in the first century before Christ.<br /><br />I found this volume in the series to be one of the best!<br /><br />She describes in great detail the dictatorship of Sulla; the rise to fame of Julius Caesar as well as the usual political intrigue, romance and violence which were endemic in Roman<br /><br />culture.McCullough books have more people in them than are in the typical telephone book! her prose is mostly pedestrian and<br /><br />undistinguished but there are rewards for the patient reader!<br /><br />These books are complexly plotted but what they tell us about Rome will stick in the mind of the reader for a long time to<br /><br />come.<br /><br />I have been hooked by them and would recommend them to a person<br /><br />eager to spend the time and energy to wade through them.	2005-04-03

Wagner (1813-1883) was an Anti-Semit of the<br /><br />worst sort. He was an egotist who borrowed money from friends<br /><br />never to be paid back.  He disdained the friends and influential folk such as the composer Meyerbeer and H. Heine the poet who<br /><br />trumpeted his cause and aided his rise from obscurity. Wagner<br /><br />has the worst character of any major composer in this reviewer<br /><br />'s opinion.<br /><br />  He was also a genius transforming opera into the music drama<br /><br />of the modern era whose psychological insights into the psyche<br /><br />were extraordinary.<br /><br />  Kohler does an excellent job of telling the oft told tale of<br /><br />Wagner's life and works.<br /><br />  I have read many books on Richard Wagner and this one hits<br /><br />the mark.

Grant (1904-1986) was the Bristol born son of a alduterous father and a mother who spent most of her years in an insane asylum (Cary thought for years that she was dead!).<br /><br />  Eliot spins the tale of the acrobatic Grant who left Britain for the golden dream of America. Along the way he starred in 73 movies including many classics. My favortie parts of the book deal with his work on such Hitchcock classics as \\"Suspicion:;<br /><br />\\"Notorious\\"; \\"To Catch a Thief\\" and \\"Morth by Northwest\\". Grant<br /><br />worked well with the best female stars in light comedy such as<br /><br />Irene Dunne, Katherine Hepburn and the luminous Carole Lombard.<br /><br />  Grant had a quintet of wives: Virginia Cherrill; Barbara Hutton; Betsy Drake; Dyan Cannon and Barbara Harris. His daughter Jennifer was the product of his short marriage to Cannon.<br /><br />  Grant lived for years with Randolph Scott and was clearly bisexual.<br /><br />  Cary enjoyed racing, saving his money and being well dressed.<br /><br />He also enjoyed countless amours with very young women.<br /><br />  Grant was not the perfection of manhood seen on the screen but a man with many personal problems from LSD use to contemplated suicide.<br /><br />  Eliot writes with verve and in a matter of fact manner making no authorial moral judgments on the boy from Bristol.<br /><br />  As long as movies exist so will the stardom of Cary Grant.<br /><br />Marc Eliot's biography stands as the definitive account of the actor's life. It is well worth the time of those interested in the Golden Age of Hollywood. It is chock full of telling anecdotes about Grant and his peers. Recommended!	2004-10-20

He gives thumbsketch portraits of the commanders and common soldiers who took part in this opening round of the three day bloofest that makes Gettysburg the most famous battle of the Civil War.<br /><br />  This book is not for beginners since it is detailed and the battle actions are complex in his descriptions.<br /><br />  The book is well illustrated but more maps are needed to clarify the description of the actions.<br /><br />  The author knows the battle perhaps as well or better than anyone else writing history.

James Chace is a professor who is adept at writing a book in clear, succint and understandable prose. In this new tome he<br /><br />examines the exciting 1912 Presidental race. The candidates:<br /><br />1. William Howard Taft the heir apparent to the Republican<br /><br />Presidential crown worn with aplomb by the genius T.R. Taft<br /><br />was conservative and pro-big business. He loved TR and was<br /><br />hurt when the Rough Rider left the Republican Party to initiate his own Progressive (Bull Moose Party). Taft loved the law and later was appointed to the US Supreme Court. He was kind, affable, henpecked and was a mediocre president and poor campaigner. He came in third in the general election.<br /><br />2. Woodrow Wilson-The son of the Presbyterian manse, former<br /><br />President of Princteton and an idealistic reformer he won the<br /><br />race and went on to serve two terms. Wilson was a racist and<br /><br />was not popular among the immigrant voters. He comes across as<br /><br />shallow in thought and stubborn in his refusal to work with Republicans in getting the League of Nations entry for the US<br /><br />approved following World War I. The prissy Wilson did manage to<br /><br />work for reforms in business and government. He was the arch foe of T.R. His mantra was a New Freedom for America,<br /><br />3. Theodore Roosevlet-one of our greatest presidents he decided to run for a third term after becoming disgusted with the rightward drift of the GOP. He preached a gospel of regulating the trusts, fiscal reform and a new nationalism. TR believed in a  strong military and civil rights. His feud with Taft led to a splintering of the Republican party opening the door for Democrat Wilson to walk into the White House. TR died in 1919<br /><br />embittered by the loss of his son Quentin in World War One . If<br /><br />he had lived he would probably had been touted to head the GOP<br /><br />ticket in 1920.<br /><br />4. Eugene Debs-a giant of American labor agitation he fought hard for the rights of the poor and union members. Debs was<br /><br />a controversial figure who was jailed in World War I for sedition only to be pardoned by Warren G. Harding in 1921.<br /><br />Debs was a complex figure but an appealing one.<br /><br />  In today's political arena one wishes presidential timber grew as tall as it did in 1912.<br /><br />  Chace's tall is a general account of the election. It is a<br /><br />good book and an indispensible one for someone who knows nothing about the 1912 presidential contes. As such it will appeal more to the general reader than the seasoned scholar of the era.<br /><br />  I read the book in two days enjoying it and learning from it.bs was <br />a controversial figure who was jailed in World War I for sedition only to be pardoned by Warren G.

Porter was the scion of a wealthy family from Peru, Indiana. As a lad he excelled in music making and<br /><br />graduated with a degree from Yale University. After a year of Law School at Harvard the travel loving Porter journeyed to Paris. He wed Linda Lee Thomas a wealthy woman several years his senior. Porter was gay and the marriage to Linda was sexless. The couple did love one another and Porter was never the same following Linda's death in 1954.<br /><br />  Porter wrote one fabulous musical after another for over 40 years. He lived in luxury with staff to attend his every need. He had a wide circle of friends from among the cultural and literary elite but was an aloof, fastidious, secretive man. Porter was a hard man to know and this biography is about as close as we will ever get to the inner core of the composer.<br /><br />  Porter was a genius in the witty line, the fetching tune and had the ability to make Broadway take notice during his fabulous career.<br /><br />  His life was placid but painful following his fall from a horse and the amputation of a leg. He was alcoholic and probably took durgs.<br /><br />  McBrien is an English professor who has written a well cratede book rich in anecdote. The book is well illustrated with photos from the Porter legacy. Several of Cole's famed lyrics are recorded to the delight of the reader.<br /><br />  With the new movie on Cole Porter this is a good supplement to the film. Well recommended.	2004-08-18

Hines holds the record for most performances at the venerable Metropolitan Opera House and was an outstanding Christian artist.<br /><br />  In this book he interviews 40 opera stars (the likes of Pavarotti, Milnes, Domingo, Milanova, Horne, Sutherland and<br /><br />many others) about the technical vocal aspects of their difficult<br /><br />art. He also includes two interviews with throat specialists and a good interview with a music critic.<br /><br />  The book is good for aspiring singers but the biographical data on the stars is kept to a minimum.  This is because Hines wants the book to deal with the art of singing rather than delve into the careers of the artists whom he talked with over several years.<br /><br />  As a non-singer but opera fan I thought he did a fine job in explaining the way an opera singer has to prepare for the stage. One comes away knowing that opera singers have to be smart, have<br /><br />great stamina and remain in top physical condition to practice their craft. Well done.	2004-08-16

The average person knows little about the Western theatre of the conflict which was<br /><br /> crucial in leading to ultimate union victory (not that the Eastern theatre wasn't also key!).<br /><br /> The Rev. Larry Daniel's books on Shiloh and Soldiering in the Army of Tennesse are well done. In his latest work he chronicles the history of the Army of the Cumberland largest of the three<br /><br /> major union armies in the Western Theatre (the other two being the Army of the Tennessee and the Army of the Ohio).<br /><br /> Instead of strictly battlefield accounts of such important battles as Shiloh, Stones River, Perryville, Chickamauga,<br /><br /> Chattanooga and the Atlanta Campaign the author focuses more<br /><br /> on the personalities and conflicts among the commanders.<br /><br /> Daniel draws detailed accounts of the five commanders of the Army of the Cumberland: Robert Anderson, William Sherman, Don<br /><br /> Carlos Buell, William Starke Rosecrans and George Thomas.<br /><br /> All of these men had major faults, enemies within the ranks and made mistakes. Nevertheless, the Army of the Cumberland fought well in several tough campaigns of the war.<br /><br /> Daniel writes clearly and his prose is easy to follow. The book took years to write, is well researched though it does need more and better maps.<br /><br /> This is a good book for a Civil War reader tired of the endless tomes on Virginia battles and longing to learn more<br /><br /> about the western campaigns of the Civil War.	2004-07-30

Washington was the commander of the continental army who won the Revolutionary War, became our first president and remains as an example to all Americans.<br />  Chadwick discusses in great (sometimes tedious) detail the problems Washington faced during the war. Disease, starvation,<br />difficult officers, mutinies of the troops and combatting the British Army. Washington had to deal with a Congress whose ability to provision and arm the forces in the field left much too desire. Throughout the war Washington was able through his broad political skills to win alliances with local officials, governors and congressional officials to perserve to the ultimate victory in Yorktown.<br />  As President of the U.S. Washington led to the formation of a strong federal government made our three branch government work<br />through strong and forceful leadership.<br />  Chadwick has a somewhat dull matter of fact style but one comes away from a reading of this long book with a deep appreciation of all that the great Washington endured to make America a free nation.<br />  The book is short on battlefield descriptions and very long on the events occuring during the winter encampments of the ragtag army at hellholes such as Valley Forge and Monmouth.<br />  This is a good book for the general reader interested in expanding one's knowledge on our nation's first president.	2004-07-12

Along the way Hank managed to<br />live in what was often an alcholoh induced haze.<br />  Williams was raised by his tough as nails mother Miss Lillian<br />who was oft married, ruled the roost and tried to control the erratic genius of her wayward son. Hank had an affinity for strong minded women. His first wife Audrey and second wife Billie were women who lived with the mecurial genius who wrote like an angel but lived the devil of a life.<br />  Colin Escott is a British writer who draws a nuts and bolts portrait of Williams. His portrait is that of a poor boy from a poor part of southwest Alabama who from 1949-1953 dominated post World War II country music or hillybill music as it was called in those distant days.<br />  Williams wrote such classics as &quot;Cold Cold Heart, &quot;YourCheating Heart&quot; and others. Along the way he was helped by Fred Rose of Acuff-Rose publishing company along with the friends in the business from Ernest Tubb to Minnie Pearl.<br />  Hank could not deal with fame and retreated into his booze and died an early death.<br />  He is the greatest country music singer. Escott has done a good job but some readers may be bored by all the verbiage dedicated to record deals and the politics of the recording industry.<br />  Nevertheless, I loved this book.

In this well done historical work Professor Ferguson draws lessons from the years when the British nation stood supreme as an empirial colossus. England ruled over 25% of the globe for several centuries until the empire died so that freedom might live in the battle versus Fascism in World War II.<br />  Ferguson shows us the growth of English empire by looking at trading and religious trends in the farflung lands ruled by Queen Victoria. He examines British rule in such farflung lands as India, the Caribbean, Africa and the Far East.<br />  The Empire was good in its emphasis on law and order bringing Western ideas of democracy to many parts of the world. The empire also was guilty of many crimes such as slavery, greed and Western domination of other cultures.<br />  On the whole, however, the Empire was valuable for its civilizing influnece training emerging nations in democratic government.<br />  Ferguson is a brilliant writer especially strong on economic growth allowing England to dominate the nineteenth century through her sea trade and control over vast areas of the globe. In a day when the United States is the new empire we can learn from the lessons of British power.<br />  This book is well done but maps could have been used to make the text more understandable.

The paperback version I read was an updated edition based on the 1959 book,  This latest edition adds news material on Joyce.<br />  James Joyce was a wanderer who never saw Dublin after 1912. The expatriate author lived in lower middle class circumstances with his longsuffering wife Nora Barnacle who he didn't marry until 1931. The Joyce family lived in Trieste, Paris and Zurich where the author died in his late 50s. Joyce eked out a living as a teacher of English and translator. He spoke several languages as was the most erudite major author of the century.<br />  Ellman's work is very detailed with footnotes and letters on almost every page.  This may prove distracting to the general reader.  Be warned that this work is scholarly and is not written in a popular style.<br />  Ellmann discusses the genesis of such classics as Joyce's<br />Dubliners, Ulysses and the almost incomprehensible Finnegan's Wake. Joyce's life was centered around his writing and his family of Nora and the two children Georgio and Lucia )who had severe mental problems). His life was not an exciting one but a journey of the human intellect and soul to the mountaintop of the most innovative writing of the age. Joyce had severe difficulties in his eyesight suffering over a dozen operations to help his eyes. He was an eccentric Irish bard who sang his songs to all who would seek to explore his world. No one is more associated with Dublin that this Dante of the Irish capital.<br />  This biography took me over a week to read.  It is slow going and not a page turner.  It is, however, the one work you must read if you seek to understand Joyce. Ellmann has done his homework and produced a literary life masterpiece.	2004-06-11

His research in the complex politcial world of nineteenth century Europe is well done.<br />  Napoleon emerges from Englund's book as something of a Renassiance soldier of fortune, The little corporal rose from a lieutenant of artilleryin the Republic army to become the titan of nineteenth century Europe,<br />  Napoleon as delineated by Englund is seen as a complex man of warth and cruelty. Bonaparte loved his family and France. He was<br />a man who believed in strong authoritan rule whose Code Napoleon and military victories and defeat placed an indelible impact on France.<br />  This book is slow reading. Englund's style is replete with long words and is written in a lapidary, anecdotal style reminiscent of an earlier era of histographic authorship.<br />  I fraknly was bored by much of the intricate politcs involved in the countries conquered, ruled and opposed by Empire France.<br />The accounts of battles are brief relating to how they affected Napoleonic politcal stratgey. The personal life of Napoleon is briefly chronicled but the interest remains focused on politics,<br />  Those wanting the best account of the military aspects of Napoleon's rule would be better served by reading David Chandler's Campaigns of Napoleon. The Army of the Empire has been well presented by the work of Elting.<br />  This work should not be used as an introduction to the Napleonic world. It is somewhat specialized and lacks good maps.<br />Many of the characters are assumed to already be familiar to the reader.<br />  This book is useful for the information it conveys. It is worth the time spent in reading it. Recommended for history buffs but not for those with only a general interest in the man and the European landscape of post-Revolutionary France.	2004-05-31

Kevin Brownlow's great book on the silent film world is over thirty years old but holds up well. Browlow is a British writer who was able to interview many of the silent film people while he gained first hand knowledge on their contributions to a lost world.<br />  Each chapter of the book deals with either a famous actor/director of the era or covers an aspect of fliming.<br />Brownlow has outstanding chapters on such luminaries as D.W.<br />Griffith, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Abel Gance, Irving Thalberg, Gloria Swanson. C.B. DeMille Mary Pickford/Doug Fairbanks as well as several others.<br />  His chapter on the making of Ben-Hur is a classic account of the making of this great film. Brownlow deals in other chapters with the lives of stunt-mens, silent comedy, the importance of the art director/production personnel as well as letting us see how the medium has grown technically over the decades.<br />  If you read one book on the silent film era this should be the one to do it for you. A college course on film should include this outstanding work.<br />  Kevin Brownlow loves movies and has done a superb job in this<br />page turning tour of silent movieland. As Charlie Chaplin walks through our memories as the little Tramp so too will this fine<br />book shine in our memories as we thank Brownlow for a beautiful trip through the splendors of early moviemaking.	2004-05-26

Alexander Hamilton (1755-104) is a founding father most Americans know little about. Hamilton was born in Nevis in the West Indians and was born illegitimately.  He was soon orphaned and worked in a counting house. Wealthy friends in the Caribbean raised enough money to send the lad to the English colonies. While a student at college in New York the young Hamilton became enflamed with the fire of independence for the British colonies.<br />The young soldier served as an aide to George Washington. The aloof Washington depended on Hamilton for outstanding service during the eight long years of the Revolutionary War.<br />  With the end of the war Hamilton became a brillian attorney, married into the wealthy and politically influential Schuyler familey, sired eight children and carried on at least one amorous dalliance.<br />  Hamilton wrote the bulk of the Federalist papers leading to conflict with America's leading Anti-Federalist Thomas Jefferson. As our nation's first Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton worked hard to make the executive branch of government the most powerful. He set up the Coast Guard and the Customs departments and made the federal government a strong source of order and stability in the infant nation.<br />  Along the way Hamilton made many enemies and in 1804 was killed in a duel with the notrious Vice-President Aaron Burr.<br />  Chernow's book is history but there is enough material in these crowded 800 pages for several novels!<br />  Hamilton was a complex genius who died young but whose legacy of a strong central government remains. His advocacy of a strong Federal Constitution and fiscal responsibility paved the way for making the United States a world power.<br />  Chernow writes well with his material being buttressed by outstanding research.<br />  This book kept me busy for several hours each day for a week.<br />It is a book which will become a classic and the definitive popular work on Mr. Hamilton.<br />  If you read one biography this year grab this one of the shelf and relish hours spent in the company of one of the giant founders of America.

Three colonies were already in the hands of the British during the early days of the American Revolutionary War. Rhode Island,<br />New York and New Jersey were filled with British regulars under the command of General Howe. General Washington the proud, aloof and ambitious scion of old Virginia commanded a band of New England sailors and merchants from the norteast. They were forced to face the might of the greatest army in the world. Over<br />2/3 of the British regular army was in North America. These troops were veterans, well trained and brutal in their bellicose skills to destroy an opponent. The British troops also had the assistance of the excellent Hessian troops.<br />  But...guess what? The fledgling American army under the great General Washington defeated them through skill in combat, strategy and the use of all types of warfare from urban street to street battle to guerilla tactics and double envelopment maneuvering. Washington also made use of intelligence through spying and was an awe inspiring leader able to elicit the support of independent minded Americans.<br />  Hackett-Fischer is a great historian who tells the exciting story of the two battles of Trenton and the American victory over the British at Princeton in the bleak winter of 1776-1777<br />with detail,colorful details and an array of well drawn battle maps, period illustrations and portrait sketches of the leading participants in the struggle for a new nation.<br />  The book reads like a novel but is based solidly on years of resarch.  I came to appreciate Washington and American democracy even more in this timing of testing in Iraq. May the American spirit be revived as we look back to the dark days of the war thatr made us a nation with a new resolve to defend democracy and<br />eschew brutality and mistreatment of the enemy., Washington's army was led by a great man who never gave up even when the snows fell, the army rosters were populated by starving troops and hope for foreign assistance to defeat the British was far off on the horizon of a new tomorrow.<br />  Hackett-Fishers previous classics &quot;Albion's Seed&quot; and &quot;Paul<br />Revere's Ride&quot; are excellent insights into colonial America and the true birth of our nation. Anyone who considers our history to be boring should pour into the fascinating pages given us by this master of the art of history who is also a born storyteller.<br />A great book!efeat the British was far off on the horizon of a new tomorrow.<BR>  Hackett-Fishers previous classics &quot;Albion's Seed&quot; and &quot;Paul<BR>Revere's Ride&quot; are excellent insights into colonial America and the true birth of our nation.

Mr. Bush sought to link Saddam with the 9-11 horror at the World Trade Center.<br />  Bush pursued a policy of working on covert efforts to oust Saddam from power while at the same time working for a peaceful<br />diplomatic solution to the problem working through the UN.<br />Here is how the cabinet members stack up:<br />Powell-He and undersecretary of state Richard Armitage are my favorites in the Bush administration. They sought a judicious plan of working through our allies and the UN to deal with Saddam.<br />Donald Rumsfeld the Secretary of Defense is a technocratic but innovative Secretary of Defense. He does what he is paid to do and does it well in getting the military shaped up to deal with the nation's three pronged war against 1. gloabal terror; 2.Afghanistan and 3. Iraq.<br />Dick Cheney is a right wing hawk who urged Bush to go to war against Iraq.<br />Condie Rice's purpose in life seems to be to keep peace between Cheney and Colin Powell at State.<br />  Woodward tells the story of our involvement in the Iraqui war from early planning to the day the war began in March, 2003.<br />  Bob Woodward is an outstanding reporter. I consider him the best journalist on the scene. He knows the players, the issues and the Washington scene based on over three decades in D.C.<br />Woodward's reporting is reason for we Americans to thank our<br />Constitution for guaranteeing us a free press.<br />  Bob Woodward has done a wonderful job for the American people in describing our descent into war. Excellentlly done!	2004-04-30

Charles II returned to reign in England from 160-1685 after living several years abroad. Charles was forced to flee England during the reign of the Stuart's arch enemy Oliver Cromwell and the Parliamentary army which executed Charles I in 1649 and for over a decade ran a nation deprived of a reigning monarch.<br />  Folowing the death of Cromwell the leaders of the land proclaimed Charles II the king. The Merry Monarch was vain,<br />self-indulgent, a womanizer extraordinaire and intellectually l;azy. During his reign London underwent the plague, the Great Fire as the Protestants and Catholics waged war to reign in the land of Albion.<br />  Many women contributed to the telling of this tale. Charles domineering and strong French mother Henrietta Marie; his longtime mistress Diana Villiers, his French favorite the coquettish Louise Keroualle and my favorite one of all-the Cockney actress Nell Gwynn.<br />  Wilson is British and assumes the reader to be well acquainted with seventeenth century politics. It is hard to keep all the many players in this drama straight at times.  The book is not a lascivious laying out of the king's countless love affairs but is a judicious appraisal of the Stuart king's reign.<br />  Many American readers will find the book dull and slow moving. The book lacks maps but has several fine reproductions of cartoons and art work from the period under scrutiny.<br />  Wilson has written a book which will inform the reader but for my shekels the money is on the better biograpy of Charles II<br />written by Antonia Fraser.	2004-04-13

Evans is an eminent British historian of the Thrid Reich. This is the first volume of a three work set exploring Nazi Germany from its origins in the fruitcake fringe of ultra-<br />right wing and paramilitary forces in Germany in the post-World War I era. Volume 2 will cover 1933-1939 while the third book<br />will deal with the war years from 1939-1945.<br />  Evans has done his homework inculding an extensive foray into German language secondary works as well as first person accounts.<br />  Following World War I Germany was strapped with outrageous<br />indemnity payments to Britain and France leading to widespread<br />inflation, unemployment and anarcy in the streets.<br />  Evans goes into extensive detail concerning the roots of Anti-<br />semitism in the works of men like Houston Chamberlain and the operas of Richard Wagner.<br />  The motivating factors leading to the rise of Nazism were Anti-Semitism, a hatred of democratic liberalism and fear of Communism in all its forms.<br />  Hitler and his cronies were skillful in winning power by their<br />manipulation of the democratic process leading to the naming of Hitler to a coalition cabinet in 1932. As Reich Chancellor Hitler's men soon took power away from the military, conservative<br />governmental leaders and led Germany to destruction.  While they never won a majority vote in several elections they did use the<br />dark days of the Depression and the divisiveness of their opponents to win ultimate power.<br />  Evans is good in showing the complex machinations which occurred in Germans politics to win the Nazis their supremacy.<br />Events such as the Reichstag Fire led to Hitler's being able to rule the land based on an enabling act giving him ultimate power.<br />  Evans takes a broad view of German cultural developments as he chronicles the way in which the Nazis warred against intellectuals in realms from art, literature, music, movies to nuclear science. One of the chief weapons in the rubber truncheon wielding hands of the SS and SA thugs was terror. I was surprised to see how soon after the Nazi takeover in January 1933 the evil empire set up concentration camps for opponents, stifled a free press and became a police state under the cruel<br />Himmler.<br />  As one who has read on the Thrid Reich for years this book was<br />well done even though the general reader may become bored with the incredible detail Evans devotes to German politics . The democratic Weimar Republic never had a chance against the Nazis<br />due to its weakn leaders, high inflationary economy and widespread unemployment.<br />  I will read the next two volumes from Evans.<br />  As a footnote readers will be aided in their study by the maps and the election trends included in the book by the author.<br />  A sober, dry and factual account we in our age of terrorism and<br />police regimes should study, ponder and learn from.

Mary was raised in the decadent court of France when she married the French king. Later she would marry twice more-Darnley who was murdered and the murderer of her husband Bothwell. Mary was impetuous, vain,a Francophile and a devoted Roman Catholic. Her wish was to make England Catholic and herself queen. She was devious and loved nothing more than a good plot against cousin Elizabeth. Mary died in 1587 as Elizabeth executed her Scottish cousin due to the latter's involvement in a plot against her own life.<br />  Elizabeth spent time in the Tower as an adolescent placed their by her half-sister Bloody Mary; had outstanding advisors to guide her diplomacy (such as Cecil, Leicester and Walsingham)<br />while Mary made one tragic mistake after another.

The four folk cultures he delineates are:<br />1. New England-the Puritans came from the East Anglia region of<br />England. They were pious, hardworking and intoxicated with theology and ordedr.<br />2. The Middle Colonies-the Quaker influence is profound in this region of Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey. William Penn and the followers of the Quaker founder George Fox were the most liberal minded of the quartet of folk cultures chronicled by Fischer. The Quaker culture was influential in the southwest and midland counties of Britain. Their belief in religous toleration has added much to American democracy.<br />3. The tidewider and coastal south was settled by southern English natives who were Cavaliers supportive of the Stuart<br />dynasty. This society was hierarchial and based on honor and<br />fueled by chattel slavery.<br />4. the backcountry region was settled by Englishmen from the northern border region of England, Scotland and Ulster Scotch-Irish.

Vowell's book is an easy read which is not to be missed. Enjoy it!	2004-02-13

Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864) was an enigma wrapped in a mystery.  Hawhthorne the scion of Salem Mass.Puritans was a man who lived his life within his tortured guilt-ridden soul. The great nineteenth century author of such gems as \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", \\"The House of the Seven Gables\\", \\"The Blithedale Romance\\",\\"The Marble Faun\\" and classic short stories comes vividly alive in this superbly crafted, researched and well written account. Wineapple is that \\"rare apple\\": an academic English professor who writes clear prose understandable by the popular reading public.<br />  Hawthorne was a complex man who kept his thoughts interior until he spilled out his concerns on the page. He was a supporter of the Democratic party meaning he was opposed to abolitionism, felt whites were the superior race and had an almost unnatural love for our 14th President Franklin Pierce (one of our worst chief executives!).<br />  Hawthorne's tale includes many interesting folks from his beautiful artistic wife Sophie and her fascinating sister Elizabeth Peabody (who may have been in love with Nathaniel)!<br />The third Peabody sister wed famed educational reformer Horace Mann.<br />  Hawthorne's children were fascinating from the etheral oldest daughter Una to the troubled Julian to the youngest child Rose who opened the first hospice for indigent cancer patients.<br />  Famed literary stars such as Emerson, Thoreau and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow are players in this story with colorful anecdotes from the pen of Wineapple. The early feminist Margaret Fuller is also discussed with acuity. Herman Melville who was Hawthorne a secretive man is chronciled as his hero worship of the Salem author led him to dedicate Moby Dick to the older man.	2004-01-30

It is a wonderfully well written, anecdotal and colorful survey of those doughy &quot;North Britons&quot; known as the Scotch.<br />  What an amazing cast of characters strust with gusto across the Scottish stage. Philosphers such as David Hume; educators and ministers such as John Witherspoon (the only clergyperson to sign our Declaration of Independence), Bonnie Prince Charlie,<br />the greatest Scottish authors Sir Walter Scott and Robert Burns<br />as well as James Boswell the chronicler of Dr. Johnson to famous architects and scientists.<br />  Herman writes in a popular style meaning he is easily understood and clear in his writing. One important memory I will take from this book is how influential the Scotch were in American history. Scotch enlightenment philosophy inspired our own Constitution and influenced such thinkers as Madison and<br />Jefferson,<br />  Scotland is a small country but mighty in world history. It was the most literate and innovation society in Europe during the eighteen-nineteenth century and continues to add to the liberal progressivism necessary if a democratic society is to flourish.<br />  This would be an excellent resource for folks planning a visit to Scotland or anyone who wants to benefit from Professor Herman's insight, wisdom, humanity and scholarship.<br />  Highly well done and assuredly well recommended by this<br />reviewer!

Geraldine Brooks is a Wall Street journalists who has covered the world in her internationial beat.  In this engaging work (her first fictional outing) she does a splendid job of delineating life in a Derbyshire village during the Great Plague of 1666.<br />  Brooks chooses to tell the grim story through the eyes of Anna a widow woman who loses her two young sons to the ravages of the bubonic plage. The village in which she lives )based on a true English village of the time) is led by a pastor who urges the people to remain in the town rather than carry the plague to surrounding villages and cities.<br />  Anna tells of her ministering to the dying and even delivers a baby. Along the way we see witchcraft accusations leading to a terrible murder of two innocent women by a rabble mad with fear.<br />Anna is close to the clergy couple who aid the dying. Anna's<br />father is a horrible drunk and child abuser who even attempts to bury a live man in order to collect the burial fee!<br />  Without revealing more of this wonderful story the reader should know that this novel is beautifully written in a style<br />focusing on the sheer wonder of living life day to day. The flowers and food, music and myths, religious zeal and tragic days of England in the year of plague come vividly alive before the reader's eye.<br />  Daniel Defoe chronicled the Year of the Plague but his work dealt with life in London during the horror. Brooks who has done her research takes us to a bucolic village which serves as a microcosm of the human soul during criis. In our day of post 9-11 the novel teaches us how in times of crisis ordinary human beings can act angel and also bestial.<br />  Well done for a rookie novelist.  This is a book which will linger in the mind months after it is collecting dust on the shelf. I enjoyed it!	2004-01-16

Mary Queen of Scots was a tragic figure in the history of<br />emerging Reformation Europe.  The tall and beautiful queen was raised in the luxurious French court where she was wed for the<br />first time. As a Stuart and Scot she became Queen of that misty<br />Scottish land in which John Knox and a band of nobles were in the proces of turning the kingdom from Roman Catholic to Presbyterian.<br />  Mary married often but without luck. Her second husband who was English and a cousin of the redoubtable Elizbeth one was Lord Darnley. He was brutally murdered by a group of nobles eager to murder the Catholic Darnley, confine Mary to domesticity and use the young son of Mary James VI as a pawn in which to wield power in Reformation Europe.<br />  Unanswered is whether Mary assisted the plot? Did she conspire with her third husband Bothwell (who was undoubtedly involved in the gunpowder plot which catapulted Darnley to Kingdom Come?)<br />  Are the casket letters containing incriminating letters from Mary to Bothwell and others geniune proving her participation in the murder plot? Historians are divided on this issue as Weir<br />makes clear.<br />  She asserts that Mary was more sinned against and was innocent in the murder of Darnley. She asserts that Mary was raped and wed by Bothwell (who would die in madness in a Danish prison) in<br />a power play for to become King of Scotland and eventually even<br />England.<br />  None of the characters are attractive personalities. Mary was often impetuous and foolish (e.g.-she fled Scotland for England where her putative friend in female thronedom Elizabeth had her promptly tried and imprisoned and finally executed!).<br />  Darnley was a stupid fop eager for sex and play in the fields and in the parlors of Scotland.  Bothwell was a brutal bully and womanizer who was a \\"rotter\\" of the first magnitude!<br />  The book is long and often is quite dull. It takes a detailed knowledge of who was who in Scotland and Europe at the time. The cast of plotting, corrupt and sinister figures is vast and almost<br />impossible to keep straight as one reads.<br />  I have read all of Alison Weir's books and she is a reuptable popular historian. However I would advise the Amazon reader to order the more lucid biography on Mary by Lady Antonia Fraser.<br />  The book is well researched; Weir knows her subject well but<br />to the nonspecialist in the time and characters she has trouble keeping an American reader interested in whatever happens to the puppets who parade their sanguinary passiona in this six hundred page opus.g, corrupt and sinister figures is vast and almost<BR>impossible to keep straight as one reads.<BR>  I have read all of Alison Weir's books and she is a reuptable popular historian.

Franklin is FDR the President of the United States during the bleak days of the Great Depressio, Father of the New Deal and Commander in Chief of America's legions in World War II. In my opinion he is the greatest leader our nation has had since the days of Abraham Lincoln. A man who was unable to walk due to polio but who picked a reeling nation up from the floor of depression to achieve greatness by World War II's end in 1945/<br />  Roosevelt as portrayed by Meacham was a man for all seasons, complex, mercurial and secretive. He was the adored only son of a smothering mother; rich and powerful, an adulterer with Lucy Mercer in his early Washington days as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He was bookish, loved collecting stamps and was fascinated with the navy. He was also adept at manipulating people to meet his goals. His valiant effort to assist England in opening days of the war saved Britain as the bombs fell on London.<br />  WSC was neglected by his parents (his mother Jennie was a wealthy American); wealthy, also complex and famed as an author (Nobel Prize for Literature), politicial genius and a warmhearted chap who enjoyed good cigars, liquor and defeating Hitler and his cronies.<br />  Meacham tells the marvelous story of the complex relationship between these two legendary figures. His approach in anecdotal and liberally fleshed out with speeches they both gave; details of the wartime conferences they held together (along with the dour and devilish dictator Stalin) in such exotic locales as Casablanca, Cairo and Yalta in the Crimea.<br />  I picked up this slim volume and found it to be a joy to read and relish. In our day of mediocre leaders it is refreshing to read Meachanm's lively account of a legendary friendship between<br />two giants. In a real sense it could be said that without the leadership of Churchill and Roosevelt working together the black<br />evil of Fascism may have conquered democracy.<br />  This book is an excellent introduction to anyone interested in<br />the personalities involved in international relationships/<br />Meacham is a young man whose future in biography is bright!<br />Pick up a copy of this gem and share it with your children and grandchildren!

However she led a remarkable life worthy of recounting. Gellhorn was the daughter of a German doctor and a suffragete mother growing up as a rebel in turn of the century St. Louis. The rebel dropped out of Bryn Mawr after two years to pursue her dream of reporting<br />on a variety of newspapers as well as respected periodicals such as Colliers and The New Yorker.<br />  Moorhead details Martha's long odyssey through the twentieth century as she covered the Spanish Civil War, World War II and even a brief stint in Vietnam.  Along the way this braniest of Hemingway's quartet of wives managed to have several abortions and countless affairs.<br />  Moorhead reveals Gellhorn's fixation on a slim fgure and a pretty face. Her relationship with an adopted son from war ravaged Italy was rocky and she lacked mothering skills.<br />  Gellhorn was a feminist before her time who lived a life of travel, excitement and glamour.<br />  My problems with the book are:<br />a. Moorhead doesn't include enough excerpts from Gellhorn's writings.<br />b  I found Gellhorn's character to be self-centered. She longed for love but couldn't settle her incessant wanderlust. Perhaps her most important relationship was with her mother Edna.<br />  Hemingway is portrayed negatively as a bragging, bully who worshipped himself and eschewed long term commitments,<br />  This book is OK but I come away not caring much for Martha despite her many achievements	2003-11-17

Alfred Joseph Hitchcock was enigmatic, complex, artistic, sexually impotent and a potent force in 20th ca. film, From his days as Paramount-Famous Players in his native London this cockney genius spun his web of mystery, suspense, high fashion,<br />laughter and the peculiarities of humanity with wit, charm,<br />beauty and a superb storytelling sense. Hitchcock is my favorite director; in this insightful new biography my McGilligan the master of suspense's career is carefully delineated.<br />  McGilligan will give the reader the details on all of \\"Hitch's<br />films including fascinating behind the scene anecdotes of such stars in the Hitchcock heaven as Cary Grant, James Stewart, Grace Kelly and Tippi Hedren.<br />  This past year I've read several biographies of Hitchcok.

In fact, I prefer this one to Spoto's biography which tends to put Hitch on the psychiatric couch.<br />  If you want the best one volume biography of Sir Alfred this is the book you should purchase.<br />  The biography is well researched, written and includes several candid photos from Hitchcock's long and distinguished career.<br />  I recommend this volume to everyone from general reader to one who like myself snatches up everything about one of the masters of the medium.

A military genius who could be very cruel and merciful. A tireless workaholic whose military genius burns brightly in the annals of history.<br />  Chandler's work is replete with maps and illustrations from the Napoleonic era. His writing is clear and easy to follow. The chapter on Napoleon's strategical genius is outstanding. All of the 60 major battles are covered.<br />  As a longtime Civil War buff jaded from reading my umpteeth account of Gettysburg I found much of interest in Chandler's<br />work.

Russel Beatie has done an excellent job with his first volume on the long and storied history of the Army of the Potomac! In this first volume he seeks to do for the greatest of the Union armies what Douglas Southall Freeman did for the fabled Army of Northern Virginia.<br />  It is probable that Beatie's book will sell far fewer copies than did Dr. Freeman's classic work.  However, the book is well worth pouring over its detailed pages as lawyer Beatie sketches the first confusing months of the Civil War from the  Union viewpoint.<br />  As someone who has read Civil War literature for many years I confess that my knowledge of the Army of the Potomac is vastly inferior to what I know of Lee's legions. Beatie is strong on character sketches of such men as Winfield Scott, Irvin McDowell and the engimatic and controversial George Brinton McClellan.<br />For these sketches alone the book is valuable.  His battle descriptions are succint but well done.  The maps are helpful to the text and easy to read.<br />  I noticed a few typos and factual errors but am much impressed by the long years of Beatie's resources. His bibliograpy of first person eyewitness acocunts and unit histories is vast.<br />  I look forward to volume two which will pick up the story from September, 1861.

On the Western Front the German army launches a massive offensive in the Amiens region of Northern France against the British Army. Lynn MacDonald continues in this tome her oral history of the Great War.<br />  The eyewitness accounts of German, French and German participants in the horrific hell of Spring 1918 make this book a valuable addition to the history of the war. MacDonald has done a beautiful job of reporting on the hellacious sights, smells and utter Dantesque horror of trench warfare.  This book would be an excellent addition to anyone's library who is interested in World War I from the perspective of both the common soldier and the generals at GHQ.<br />  This is my first exposure to Macdonald and she has whetted my interest to read more of her work.<br />  Americans are not as familiar with the great battles of World War I as they should be. Macdonald is a good start to begin. After reading the last paragraph I concur with William Sherman who opined that &quot;War is Hell.&quot;<br />  As the tragedy of war is unfolded on the pages of this book the reader is drawn into the vortex of the horror that is modern warfare.<br />  Lynn Macdonald is a superb researcher, writer and historian. I recommend this book very highly.<br />  PS-The maps are well drawn and helpful!	2003-09-25

Sinatra was an enigmatic, charismatic and complex singer of the American soul.  Perhaps no singer in 20th century America popular song could get inside a lyric and make it his own like the great &quot;ole blue eyes.&quot;<br />  Hamill's opening chapter in which we sit beside Sinatra and his cronies in a Brooklyn bar in 1970 is like something out of Hemingway in its description of a man, era and city.<br />  Hamill points out that it was Sinatra in music, Laguardia in politics and Joe Dimaggio in sports who raised the immigrant Italian ethnic group to greatness in insular, xenophobic America of the 1940s.<br />  Sinatrta could be obnoxious and cruel but he could also be<br />generous and kind,<br />  This book reminds me of the Penguin Lives series as it is a good starting place for anyone who wants to learn more about Sinatra, his women, his era and most importantly his music.

Vicky was the oldest child who was intellectual whose wit was acerbic and whose opinions well stated. Vicky also became the mother of Kaiser Wilhelm II of World War One fame. He was a real stinker who ever failed to get along with Vicky and her saintly spouse Fredrick (his horrible death from throat cancer is well chronciled in this work).<br />  Daughter Alice wed into the Hesse royal house and was noted for her nursing and charity efforts.<br />  Linchen was the third daughter noted for being plump and plain. Nevetheless she was stalwart in nursing and caring for her egocentric mother.<br />  In my opinion, the most likable of Victoria's daughters was Louise. The childless wife for 43 years to the Duke of Argylle this redoubtable lady was loved for her career in Canada where her husband served as governor general.  Louise also was a sculptor of some renown and attended art school outside of palace walls. She was the most liberal, artistic and lovable of the old queen's daughters.<br />  The last daughter was Beatrice whose death in late 1943 ended an era and a way of life lost amid the rubble of destruction wrought in a World War II European society.  Beatrice was a good woman who faithful to her husband and served her mother with adoring care (she did do history a disservice when she destroyed many of Victoria's letters!).<br />  The quintent of Victoria's daughters were basically good persons who lacked any true brilliance.

He was a raider supreme as he attackted British towns and ships on the coast of England and Scotland .<br />  Thomas tells in detail about Jones efforts to build an American Navy during the Revolutionary War; his frustrations with finding funding for the navy from a reluctant congree; his battles with his peers and with the formidable enemy incarnated in the British navy.<br />  Thomas gives us an easy to undersand chornicle of what war was like aboard ship in the age of sail.  His account of the battle between HMS Serapis and the Bonhommie Richard (captained by Jones) is a classic portrait of the vicious naval warfare of the violent age.<br />  Jones was a complex character who never flagged in his devotion to the new United States.  After the revolutionary war eneded he fought for Catherine the Greek as he led Russian sailors against the Turks.  Jones died in poverty in Paris. Today his tomb is at the U.S. Naval Academy.<br />  Evan Thomas is a fine historian and anyone who loves the tales of Patrick O'Brien would enjoy this entertaining, informative and inspiring story of a largely forgotten hero of our early history.	2003-07-19

O'Reilly's book is a military account of the battle eschewing the sociological implications of the battle delineated so well in George C. Rable's recent bestseller.<br />  I enjoyed both books but would recommend Rable's book for the reader who has a general interest in the battle and doesn't care for detailed accounts of military strategy.<br />  O'Reilly's book will be the standard military account for years to come.  This impressive young historian now stands in the ranks of Robert K. Krick, Gordon Rhea and Peter Cozzens in the brilliant way he tells the story of the battle. Maps were helpful to the text (although more maps could always be used!). He did make the mistake of saying Lee's birtday was on Jan. 21 when the general was born on Jan. 19th.<br />  Fredricksburg was the last complete battle where the gray legions were led by the peerless tandem of Lee and Jackson. The battle featured the first urban street fighting on a major scale in the Civil War.  Fredricksburg also saw widespread looting by Union troops on a heretofore unprecedented scale.<br />  Anyone planning to tour Fredricksburg should read this book. O'Reilly tells us of the important fighting on Prospect Hill and the slaughter before Marye's Heights (two separate battles).<br />  I would enjoy hearing O'Reilly speak at our Civil War Round Table in Knoxville or on Book TV! I am impressed by this outstand author and Civil War scholar! An excellent work!	2003-07-03

The landscape of his youth was sketched in the somber colors of a provinical childhood.  His family were seed merchants, sober and no nonsense in their approach to the realities of life.  As Matisse grew his art expanded as he journeyed to Paris and to the South of France where he discovered the glories of coloration in his art.  Matisse was the greatest of the Fauvist painters; the chief rival of Picasso and the grand old man of French painting.<br />  In this first volume of her life of Matisse, Hilary Spurling the British born biographer draws France in the dawn of the 20th<br />century as we see Matisse struggle from poverty to stability. He was supported by a loving wife, good friends and a genius which<br />burst forth in all its glory as the great master continue to grow in his art.<br />  The book is well illustrated, detailed in its description of Matisse's families, friends and opponents and well worth the reader's time.<br />  With the current exhibition of Matisse-Picasso at the Metropolitan Museum of Mordern Art it is a pleasure to turn to Spurling's fine volume on Matisse to gain further insights into this giant of modern art.  I recommend this book to everyone from art expert to the educated general reader seeking further insights into the evolution of a painter of genius.	2003-05-20

Macmillan is a native Canadian who is a granddaughter of British Prime Minister Lloyd George. In this wonderfully written, outstandingly researched and well told account of the Versailles Conference of 1919 she details all the intricate details of the event.  The reader learns how politcail and military strategy for all the major victor nations in World War I carved up the world as the dream for world peace and a League of Nation was born .<br />  I especially found fascinating her account of the Middle East and how what was done then set the stage for all the developments in this powder keg region of the world.  Macmillan also gives a good account of the nations of the Balkans and Central Europe clarifying what they hoped to receive from the hands of the United States, Britain, France and Italy (the major<br />nations at the Conference).<br />  Good thumbnail sketches of the major players from Woodrow Wilson the scholarly US leader to the ebullient Lloyd George and<br />a large supporting cast are valuable.<br />  This book would do quite well in a college course on 20th century Europe and the Middle East.  I recommend it!	2003-05-14

As self-described Charles Dickens was the \\"inimitable.\\" Dickens draws a broad stoke as his thousands of characters lie, cheat,[borrow], love, live and [end life] on the canvas of humanity.<br />  As one who has read all the standard biographies of the 19th behemoth of literature that was Dickens I can highly recommend this excellent book.<br />  Smiley provides a sketch of Dickens life including warts and all.  Her dissection of the affair the middle aged author engaged in with actress Ellen Ternan was well done in looking at what may have motivated Dickens to break with his wife Catherine and thumb his nose at Victorian respectability.<br />  Dickens is a mixture of good and bad with the humanity and essential goodness of the man on display.<br />  This little book in the excellent Penguin Viking Biography series could be well used in an introductory course on Dickens, the nineteenth century English novel or on the art of literary biography.<br />  Smiley made me smile and laugh as I explored the mind of a genius with this gifted biographer.  It is the best biography I have so far read in this series.	2003-04-21

Strolling through the Mall I decided to stop in for a brief visit to the mass market oriented bookstore.  Thumbing through the Civil War offerings I picked up this outstanding book.  I did not recognize the name of George Walsh.  He is a Yankee writing on the army whose story has been so well told from Southern superstars such as Douglass Southall Freeman, Clfford<br />Dowdey and Shelby Foote.  Why plunk down a Visa card to purchase it?<br />  Curiosity satisfied is the answer! Walsh writes in a personal style introducing the men and the units making up Lee's fabled Army of Northern Virgnia.  Even an old Civil War buff such as I learned new things about the Victorian warriors of Dixieland who lend the forces of Lee against the enemy.<br />  This book is an excellent survey of the war in the Eastern theatre.  It is a valuable additon to my Civil War library. I highly recommend Walsh's book to anyone even casually interested in learning more about the American Illiad that is our Civil War!	2003-04-12

Hamill grew up in blue collar Brooklyn in the 40s and 50s in a working class &quot;dysfunctional&quot; famlly.  His father had lost a leg during a soccer match in distant Belfast prior to his immigration to the United States,  His hardworking, wise and wonderful mother raised a large family while remaining faithful for a drinking husband who was a heavy drinker by night and a low paid employee at many jobs during the day.<br />  Hamill takes us with us on his boyhood as he dreams of becoming a cartoonist. From the streets of Brooklyn where stickball reigned to incarceration in a Mexican jail the life tale woven by Hamill has many unexpected twists and turns. Despite his many faults Hamill has succeeded as a famed newspaper columnist and novelist. His book is easy reading and better than the much more heralded works by Frank McCourt.<br />  The language used by Hamill is rough, often scatological and may be offensive to genteel readers.  However I found it well written and engaging. The book is worth a read by anyone interested in Irish American culture, newspaper life or the journey of a man from poverty to prominence.	2003-04-03

My wife waxed rhapsodic over the prose and poetry inherent in Fanny Burney's neglected classic The Wanderer.  The narrativ tells an exciting story of the French Revolution era even though the action occurs mainly in England.  The \\"Incognita\\" is a fascinating character who moves through English society as a subordinate to the rich and cruel society folk with whom she is forced by circumstances to live.  \\"Miss Ellis endures the slings and arrows of outrageous fortunate to triumph over her enemies at last. Burney's prose is musical and her sentences flow with insight into the human condition.  As a friend of Hesther Thrale<br />she was influenced by that excellent writer.  Her father was the famed musician Dr. Charles Burney a close friend of Dr. Johnson. If you want to look at a classic of early feminism and encounter one female difficulty after another this is a good place to begin.<br />I liked the novel so well I am now engrossed in Burney's second novel \\"Cecilia\\" with her first work \\"Evelina\\" on my reading list.<br />Fanny Burney is an excellent new author to explore and be enriched by as you loose yourself in her voluminous pages!<br />Well recommended!	2003-03-21

The chapters are lengthy and filled with all sorts of National Enquirer trashy reports on glamorous love affairs and sordid details of life in the tinseltown of dreams.<br />  Wayne's book is far from great biographical literature, rehashes old rumours and deals in sensational details about the lives of the silver screen luminaries she chronicles.<br />  You may hate this book and detest the behavior of these goddesses who were all too human.

Karen Swenson is to be commended for a fine biography of Greta Garbo. Garbo is an enigmatic star more closely resembling a lonely sphinx camping out in the Sahara than a glitzy glamorous star in Hollywood's Golden Era.<br />  Swenson delineates the Garbo career from the Swede's girlhood in a poverty stricken home in Stockholm to the extremely wealthy recluse she became in New York following her 1942 retiriement from the silver screen. (Her last flick was a bomb called \\"Two Faced Woman.\\"  Garbo had at least two faces in real life. The athletic outdoor woman she was could be kind and cruel as her moods were quicksilver in the soul of this Viking child of the North.<br />  Barry Paris's book on Garbo contains more pictures and is, on the whole, better written.  I did, however, enjoy Swenson's work<br />on the screen legend devouring the biography in huge portions of time.<br />  Garbo was a great talent who lit up the screen with her peerless beauty and style.  Costumes by Adrian and the magic of MGM camermen aided her in the climb to the top but she was herself unique for her aura of lonely beauty.<br />  I appreciate the work of Karen Swenson.  I hope you the reader do as well.  If you read only one book on Greta Garbo you could do worse than selecting this excellent biography to fill  you in on the Swedish queen of film.	2003-02-18

Viva Verdi! William Berger provides a useful guide to all of the Verdi operas from the obscure &quot;Oberto&quot; to the classic comedic masterpiece &quot;Falstaff&quot; which closed the operatic master's oeuvre.<br />  Berger's book is similar to the treatment he earlier applied to Richard Wagner in his &quot; Wagner Without Fear.&quot;  This means:<br />a. Succinct but on target plot summaries of all Verdi's operas including the Verdi Requium.<br />b. Brief chapters on the staging of Verdi's operas; Verdi's works on CD and outstanding books on the Busseto genius for anyone wanting to know more about the King of Italian lyrical opera.<br />  Berger's work is worthwhile reading for the operatic novice or the veteran opera fan who wants to brush up on the labyrinthal plot of &quot;Il Trovotore&quot; or explore how Verdi's music has been used as soundtrack for motion pictures.<br />  Berger's book on Verdi is a treat for everyone enjoying opera who also relishes good writing done with wit, charm and panache!
