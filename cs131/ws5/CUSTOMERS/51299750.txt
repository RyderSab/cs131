I saw no need to start with the first book, inasmuch as I had become familiar with the characters, the setting, and the situations by listening to my students and catching glimpses of the first film.<br /><br />Fortunately, Rowling used enough references to the first book that I was able to follow and enjoy the plot lines.<br /><br />I don't qualify this as \\"great literature\\" but it is a fun and infectious read, making one want to find out what happens in Potter's continuing education at Hogwarts.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I found some of the images a little disturbing, especially the \\"headless\\" character and the girl that lived in the toilet, along with the \\"Dark Lord's\\" obsession with Potter's demise.<br /><br />If I were a parent, I'd become familiar with each book BEFORE I allowed my child to read them, offering any explanations that might be deemed necessary for the precocious, and somewhat impressionable, reader.	2005-08-02

Dyson, a minister himself, contrasts Gaye's life as a popular secular singer with his strict Pentacostal upbringing at the hands of his stern minister-father. The struggle that the singer endured played an important part in his music and the book dissects four of the artist's most challenging and enigmatic works: the classic and legendary \\"What's Going On\\", \\"Let's Get It On\\", \\"I Want You\\" and the controversial \\"Here, My Dear\\".<br />The author cuts down each album, layer by layer, revealing Gaye as a man in constant turmoil with the battle between his religious teachings and his desires as a man. Dyson also introduces the reader to many lost versions of Gaye's work, now coming to light in \\"deluxe editions\\" available for purchase.<br />Unlike most \\"men of the cloth\\", Dyson's approach is destined to draw criticism from traditional Christians for he suggests a greater openness in sexual matters, as well as less dependency on corporal punishment as a means of child-rearing. He implies that stiff and unbending Church doctrine may have contributed to Marvin's death at the hands of his preacher father.<br />The final chapter of the book compares Gaye's music and approach to life with the contemporary singer R. Kelly, an admirer of Gaye himself. This provides some interesting food for thought, as the two singers seem to share a bond transcending death and decades.<br />Dyson could've spent a little less time on social/culture commentary and more on the life of the singer at hand; however, the book is still a worthwhile read into the soul of a soul singer and the society that both uplifted and condemned him.ul singer and the society that both uplifted and condemned him.	2004-07-02

One might imagine that legendary basketball star Michael Jordan was born with a boatload of confidence.  That was not the case.  \\"Salt in His Shoes\\", written by Jordan's mother Deloris and sister Rosalyn, tells an early chapter in the life of the athlete as he struggles to come to terms with his lack of height.  Playing when he could with older brothers Larry and Ronnie, Michael is intimidated by a much taller boy named Mark.  Every time that he plays against Mark's team, the Jordan boys lose.<br />Michael goes home complaining to his mother, wishing that he could be a little taller.  Mother tells him that all she has to do is pray and put salt in his shoes.  Michael's young mind wonders how the salt can cause him to grow, but he figures that his mother's skill with raising luscious flowers must be attributed to something.  Every night he goes to sleep while Mother sprinkles her \\"magic\\" into his shoes.  However, the boy's growth is slow in coming and he feels more depressed.<br />Michael's father comforts the boy and tells him that it's not how tall he is but how he uses his skills.  This little burst of inspiration is just enough.  The next time the Jordan boys tackle Mark's team, they are victorious with Michael scoring the winning points.<br />Being fans of Michael Jordan can relate to this tale from his early days.  It is well documented that Jordan had a strong relationship with his father; however, the book reveals the powerful bond that he also had with his mother.  The story shows a nuclear family featuring both parents and siblings, all of them concerned about Michael.  This will prove to be an invaluable tool in stressing familial relationships.	2004-06-10

WARNING: SPOILERS TO FOLLOW<br />Quashiba finds herself in a precarious situation. Due to a slight untruth told by her mother to a visiting king, the young lady is forced to marry to king with the promise that she can weave fine golden cloth.<br />Though she is attended by handmaidens and receives her every want, her new husband demands that she come through with her mother?s promise after they are married one year and a day.<br />The time arrives and the girl knows not what to do. A little man with a wooden leg, a tail and wearing striped trousers magically appears one evening. He offers to help her make the fabric but with a price for his assistance: she has three nights and three chances per night to guess his name; if she doesn?t, she will be his tiny companion?forever.<br /><br />After two days of successfully presenting the golden thread to her spouse, as well of two days of unsuccessfully guessing the little man?s name, the Quashiba feels impending doom. However, during dinner, her husband tells of his unusual encounter with a little man named &quot;Lit'manhn Bittyun.&quot;<br /><br />Quashiba is relieved and that evening when the little man comes, she toys with him with two fake names, finally announcing his real name.<br /><br />The sprite storms off and is never seen again.<br />Knowledgeable readers will automatically see the similarity between this tale and the European ?Rumplestiltskin?. The book's illustrations are vivid and thought-provoking, making this book a KO for the primary classroom, combining fantasy, familial relationships, and effective use of dialect/language.<br />The late Hamilton has scored another winner that will embellish the home as well as the classroom.	2004-06-10

This little tale addresses issues of tolerance, brotherhood, and compassion in a way that primary/elementary children can understand.<br />Sister Anne comes to a Catholic school with as much wide-eyed enthusiasm about teaching as those in her charge have about learning. When an unnamed student leaves a derogatory note for the nun to find, the sister decides its' time to make her students aware of the racial conditions in America.<br />From the lesson, her children become better citizens, ultimately paving the way for a more humane society.<br />This book can be used to stimulate discussion about race, loneliness, individuality, and civic responsibility. It definitely cuts across the curriculum<br />Five stars do this book an injustice.  It's a superior work, deserving of attention and placement in the classroom.	2004-06-09

I was introduced to this book as one of the requirements in a reading endorsement course that I am presently taking.  As a veteran teacher of twenty-nine years, I am on the downside of the profession, preparing for retirement in about five years.  However, I am always welcome to new methodology or better adaptations of tested strategies.<br />This book is a concise and informative collection of skills to assist the emerging teaching as well as the one with years under his/her belt.  Current psychological trends in the teaching of reading provide essential information for parents and teachers alike.  Featuring chapters that reinforce each other as well as real-life vignettes from people in the field, the book is a worthy addition to any teacher's library.  Outstanding tables, charts, diagrams, photos, and illustrations enhance the meaningful text.  Also, the supplemental \\"Assessment and Lesson Plans\\" booklet is a great bonus.<br />I find it to be one of the best teaching tools that I have had and highly recommend it to others.	2004-06-07

Names like Morton Stevens, Gil Melle', Billy Goldenberg, Bruce Boughton, as well as film composers that occasionally dabbled in television (Jerry Goldsmith, John Williams, Franz Waxman, and Alex North) abound in the fact-filled book.<br />Divided into ten chapters, including a foreword and afterward, the book also has a list of \\"suggested listenings\\" wherein the reader can obtain recordings of respective themes and scores.<br />As I said in the title, the book is a delight for those of us with fond memories of the music of the \\"boob tube\\".<br />Table of Contents<br />Acknowledgements<br />Introduction<br />1.

From the first, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, to the transitional &quot;Star Trek: Generations&quot;, Shatner reveals the backstage drama of film production. He debunks some misconceptions about his &quot;arrogance&quot; and makes apologies to those that may have been offended. The author also chronicles how the &quot;suits&quot; in the offices of Paramount made some budget changes that, no doubt, played an integral part in the failure of the Shatner-directed &quot;Star Trek: The Final Frontier&quot;.<br />All in all, the book is a decent read for the true Trek fan; it's not one, however, that bodes well with the uninitiated.	2004-05-30

Some reviewers have been highly critical of Summer's bio because she doesn't dwell on the making of her legendary disco hits. Others claim that the singer doesn't titillate enough on the &quot;seamier&quot; sides of the music biz.<br />To those critics, I say, to quote from one the singer's seminal hits, &quot;Enough is Enough&quot;. Summer has written a fascinating book that combines a &quot;how-to&quot; for recording success along with a primer for having constructive familial and spousal relationships.<br />Throughout the book, Summer cites much of her achievements as the result of Divine Intervention; such references are clear testaments of the singer's unbending faith. She never comes across as preachy but as one who has weathered many personal and professional storms and never lost her faith.<br />She mentions the many that have had a major impact on her development as a performer, wife, mother, and woman. Summer remains faithful to those that contributed to her ascension to the top of popular music, offering revealing anecdotes on Casablanca Records president Neil Bogart, her husband Bruce, her three daughters, and one-time neighbor and lifelong friend Sophia Loren.<br />The abundance of pics from her collection is a welcome addition to a truly inspiring work.<br />And the fact that Miss Summer revels in her Christianity makes her far from &quot;ordinary&quot; in the entertainment industry.<br />Perhaps, she should've called the book &quot;Heavenly Girl&quot;.	2004-02-21

While fundamentalists might scoff at the inclusion of Biblical text in what is essentially a &quot;comic book&quot;, Mark Waid's story line doesn't rely heavily on the text; it just serves as a background for the events that unfold within the book's pages.<br />Ross's artwork is exemplary, actually surpassing anything from the &quot;Golden Era of Comics&quot;.<br />Unlike another reviewer, I found Superman, Wonder Woman, and Bruce Wayne to be well-developed characters, showing new sides of their respective personalities while exhibiting the traits that fans have come to expect from them.<br />The major players in the history of DC Comics appear in some form or fashion in this beautifully illustrated work.  Because so many make &quot;cameos&quot;, the book becomes a bit crowded, at times coming across like a &quot;Where's Waldo?&quot; as one searches for the recognizable.

I'm not sure whether this one was written after the script for the lackluster film adaptation of the first adventure, but it seems as though Moore, like the film makers, tried to throw everything (including the kitchen sink) in this one: sex, betrayal, gratuitous violence, merciless alien hordes, biological warfare, and genetic engineering. Wherein the first installment was a fresh and original concept, banding together fantasy/sci-fi greats as a superhero team to thwart a super villain, this one limps along from one frame to another, with little to hold the reader's interest.<br />Taking on H.G.Wells, one of my all-time favorite authors, might have been too much for the author to tackle.<br />Perhaps, I'm a bit of a prude but the inclusion of the May-December bedroom romp between two of the team members was a little too much for my tastes.

The elder Due tells of her involvement with the &quot;movement&quot; during the turbulent 60's. She introduces the readers to the many sit-ins, jail-ins, planning conferences, and brushes with the famous and not so famous. It is those &quot;unknown&quot; heroes that are the revelation here. Being a neighbor to nearby Tallahassee, FL (where much of the book's events occur), my eyes were opened to the significance of developments in that city to changes that would be made nationwide. Mrs. Due writes candidly and details her convictions, as well as the dedication of her fellow &quot;marchers/protestors&quot;. Her contributions as an author and activist are commendable and necessary reading for those interested in the period.<br />Tananarive Due shares her upbringing in a house headed by such politically minded and socially active parents. By writing about her college days and beyond, she reminds us that things have not changed as much as they should since her mother and others trod the streets of Tallahassee. She cites the Miami riots of the 80's (the result of the senseless murder of a black motorcyclist), as well as other highly profiled instances of human abuses.<br />The book is an essential read, if only to appreciate the people that sacrificed so much to make this country accept its creed of being &quot;one nation for all&quot;.	2003-12-27

In those pre-days, some recently freed slaves, as well as those in bondage, were covertly and overtly expressing their religious beliefs and their political views on their condiditon of servitude.<br />These four remarkable women were vocal in their opposition to the male hierarchy of the church, the &quot;expected&quot; role of women in the body of believers, and the confines of slavery as imposed on African-Americans.  Such opposition to the &quot;norm&quot; made the women less than popular in many circles; however, they stood steadfast and eventually, through their nationwide travels, brought many to their respective church folds.<br />Dr. Hayward showcases each woman, offering her analyses of their respective writings/sermons.  There are also glimpses of the women's personal lives and the burdens their travels placed on their families.<br />I wish, however, that the book had included more of the women's words, in contrast to the author's interpretation and explanation of them.<br />Overall, though, it is an intriguing work that is eye opening for those with an interest in the history of the Black church.	2003-10-05

She also made some genuinely dumb choices.<br />The young impressionable mind might assume that in order to survive, these are worthy attributes to have.<br />I made sure that my kids knew otherwise.	2003-10-04

Each story, while separate, interlocks with the humor, the pathos, the tragedy, and the warmth of the people that inhabit 145th.<br />Myers doesn't hold back in the presentation of some of the more horrific elements of life in the city.  Though the book is not particularly graphic, the book mentions drug abuse, the sadness and pressures of poverty, and the inhumanity of a \\"drive-by\\".<br />But, the book is still uplifting in its portrayal of the familial bonds that dwell on the street as residents come together to assist each other with surviving the trials and tribulations of day to day life.<br />All of the selections are well-written and engrossing, with special note given to the humorous \\"Big Joe's Funeral\\", \\"The Streak\\", the touching \\"The Fighter\\", the tender \\"Kitty and Mack: A Love Story\\", the inspirational \\"The Christmas Story\\", and the poignant \\"Angela's Eyes\\".	2003-08-24

Considering what the man went through, it's amazing that he became a writer loved by millions.<br />Heck, it's amazing that he lived past his twenty-fifth birthday!<br />Harris takes the reader on a personal journey of tragedy, recovery, and acceptance. I can't think of a better way to really get to know the man that has \\"spoken\\" for so many others in his brilliant novels.<br />This, to be truthful, is my first Harris book. I most definitely will be catching up by grabbing the others that I have missed.<br />To anyone that yearns for a little more \\"titillation\\" in the details of Mr. Harris's sexual encounters, I suggest that one reads a Jackie Collins' work.<br />Harris comes across as classy and not trashy.<br />That, obviously, accounts for his immense popularity.	2003-07-27

Having long been an avid reader, I was reintroduced to forgotten pleasures and presented with new (at that time) works that were totally fascinating.<br />\\"Tuesday\\" is in the latter category. It is short on prose but makes up for it with engrossing illustrations. The minimum of words allows the \\"reader\\" to create a different script with each visit.<br />My three-year-old niece \\"eats\\" the book up every time that either her mom, her grandfather, or even her dotting uncle takes a shine to pull it off the shelf and share it with her. Our respective interpretations of the pictures are limitless, making this a book that will live long after others have faded into obscurity.<br />Even the book's end allows the child to ponder the events of \\"Wednesday\\" and even hypothesize about the events of subsequent days.<br />Any book that plays on a child's natural tendency to dream is a winner.	2003-07-26

That withstanding, the story, with its many other literary references is a welcome addition to anyone's library.<br />Superman, Batman, Spiderman, AND the X-Men ain't got a thing on Allan Quatermain!<br />I'm placing my advance order for Volume II.	2003-06-09

The prejudices and biases endured by these gallant men and women make their respective stories an inspirational journey into the human spirit and willingness to overcome.<br />A few photographs are found mid-length and provide the reader with a view of the heroes/heroines mentioned in the text.  This is a book for the history/sociology buff as well as those that have an interest in the American military.<br />I find it a shame that more have not read or reviewed it.

Craft's first mystery is a prime example of an author &quot;testing the waters&quot;.  While the killer's identity was somewhat easy to determine, the author populates the book with some fascinating, if slightly improbable, characters.  Craft's attention to character is also evident with the personal life of protagonist Manning.<br />And the vivid descriptions of the locales and the adornments show a man that appreciates the aesthetic.<br />&quot;Flight Dreams&quot; doesn't quite ascend into the far reaches of space, but it does get airborne.<br />And what better way to spend leisure time than by being curled up with an entertaining and carefree escape from the daily grind?	2003-03-08

For close to four decades, the book's author has been a contributor, in some way or another, to the production of over 500 albums of soul music. He has done countless interviews, provided liner notes for recordings, served as producer on several, and even done a little background singing. It is obvious that if anyone knows what a &quot;diva&quot; truly is, David Nathan is that man.<br />&quot;The Soulful Divas&quot; covers the recording careers of the ladies profiled with little snippets of their non-professional beginnings, as well as individual highs and lows. However, it's these little &quot;peeks&quot; into the artists' characters that make the book such a fascinating read.<br />Not meaning to reveal much of the text, there are many little known facts reported in each profile. Each of the women has experienced her share of failed romantic relationships, legal battles with recording companies, perceived public opinions, peaks and valleys in album sales, and personal tragedies.<br />Most tragic of all showcased within the pages of the expose is the late Phyllis Hyman, a diva in every sense of the word. Like Nathan, I am a fan of hers, also, and her untimely demise still brings a lump in my throat.<br />But, the chapter on Millie Jackson is a welcome find. Jackson is the only diva profiled that is not represented in my musical library, save for a duet album with Isaac Hayes. However, after reading about the singer's body of work, as well as her down-to-earth and honest demeanor, I think that this is about to change.<br />I am curious about a certain &quot;expletive deleted&quot; symphony that she composed.<br />Note for the author: The next time around, include Patti Austin in volume two.	2003-01-02

And, finally, they must deal with the tough economic realism that their goals, even with maintaining an exemplary standing, are costly endeavors, demanding much of their finances.<br />The book is an excellent chronicle of all their struggles, providing a lesson in \\"determination, dedication, and discipline\\", the three \\"D's\\" coined by co-author Sampson (\\"Sam\\")Davis.

Like its successors, the novel does feature Craft's attention to set detail, occasional sexual encounters, and affluent characters.<br />It is the latter, however, wherein the book is weak. None of the characters have redeemable qualities; they seem to be \\"pawns\\" for each other's use.<br /><br />Perhaps, that is Craft's intention: to paint the theater world as one filled with cutthroats concerned only with their individual successes.

Like his birthplace of Texas, Hagman is wide and vast and most intriguing. Telling of his beginnings as the offspring of Broadway legend Mary Martin and his lawyer-father, the actor reveals his many highs and lows in his ascent to the heights of iconic status.<br />He lets us in on his \\"experiments\\" with drugs, his \\"lean\\" years as a struggling actor, his marriage to his beloved Maj, his television successes (both \\"I Dream of Jeannie and \\"Dallas\\", as well as the many featured roles in big and small screen films), and his interactions with the famous and not-so-familiar.<br />With a wry wit and genuine humility, the star comes across as a man at peace with himself and so self-assured that he can alternately and honestly tell of his strengths and shortcomings.<br />He may have never won an award for his distinctive television characters but to his legion of fans, he is a winner.	2002-11-21

Along the way, our protagonist butts heads with the likes of Frank Nitti, Al Capone, and legendary G-man Eliott Ness. This inclusion adds a realism that greatly enhances the storyline.<br />And the artwork is awesome!

One of the hottest cities in the world, Miami, as its setting? And one of my favorites of all the world's creatures, a manatee, being one of the focal points of the story line?<br />Well, all the above, unfortunately did not do it for me. Perhaps, \\"too many cooks in the kitchen\\" produced a souffl&eacute; with varying degrees of success. I suppose the distinctive styles of the different writers appealed to some, but I found it a wee bit disconcerting. There were some \\"hits\\" but more \\"misses\\" in this slightly amusing tale.<br />Honestly, I read this book based solely on the fact that I enjoy the writing of Tananarive Due. While her contribution is as evenly important as the other twelve writers, I don't think this is a good example of the strengths that draw me to her in her singular compositions.<br />In contrast, Evelyn Mayerson's contribution (Chapter 7: The Lock and Key) is wonderfully sarcastic and very amusing. With references to Jimmy Carter (\\"Senor Peanut\\"), O.J. lawyer Barry Scheck and an inference that actress Kim Nova had a mustache, thus indicating her likely Cuban \\"roots\\", the author adds more absurdity to the already strange happenings of previous (and subsequent) chapters.<br />I will, most definitely, be seeking out titles authored by her.<br />If only she had done the entire book, I could've rated it higher.	2002-07-16

The Joker, while always a fruitcake, gets a makeover here, and is revealed to once have been a family man. OK, so what? Is that supposed to elicit a tear from the reader?<br />Then, in the same story, he commits a crime so heinous to both Commissioner Gordon and daughter Barbara that the empathy one may have had for the fiend evaporates almost as soon as it appeared.<br />Mind you, I don't like the non-Tim Burton-directed movie versions, either. And the 60's high camp of Adam West's series didn't add much.<br />Only did the 90's animated version get the characters correctly.<br />I, honestly, didn't find the \\"joke\\" worthy of my expenditure.<br />Obviously, the majority of others represented here have different opinions...but, to each his own.	2002-07-13

Every profile of African-American actors on the tube is carefully detailed and extensively covered, with little asides that make for intriguing reading.  To this reader, it is clear that Bogle feels that there have been significant improvements in the representation of Blacks on television, but there are still some significant inroads, in front of and behind the camera, that need to be made.  By covering as thoroughly as he has the entirety of those African-American pioneers and trendsetters, the author satisfies those that have longed to see such a mammoth undertaking published.<br />I, for one, savor the profiles of such underrated performers as Rosalind Cash, Joe Morton, Shirley Hemphill, Juano Hernandez, James Edwards, and a slew of others that labored with many less-than-distinguished parts and managed to create something memorable.  It is further refreshing to see the author give the backgrounds of the more familiar African-American superstars like Bill Cosby, Cicely Tyson, and Diahann Carroll.<br />While I do not particularly care for the programs that have a \\"monochromatic cast\\" (Friends, Martin, and the various UPN \\"black-block\\" shows), I understand and appreciate Bogle's belief that television shows have a responsibility to inform and present a realistic portrayal of society, be that program a sitcom or a drama.<br />It is true that television is primarily entertainment; however, in that entertainment, thought-provoking writing and occasional commentary on society is warranted.  That is one of Bogle's premises that he eloquently expresses.<br />This is a top-notch historical/editorial reference that makes for great reading and a worthwhile addition to the library of any fan of the \\"boob tube.\\"	2002-07-10

The former pro star's current legal matters made me want to know the man behind the sports/news headlines.<br />The author/basketball player details many anecdotes contrasting growing up in the rural South and the urban Mid-Atlantic.  His tales of his years in the NBA are reflective and very revealing as he tells about fellow well-known icons of the sport from Michael Jordan to Phil Jackson to Charles Barkley.  Williams pulls no punches in describing what really makes up life in the NBA, from rookie to established star.<br />The book is chocked full of fights, contract negotiations, fights, character analyses, fights, extravagant expenditures, rowdy fans, fights, parties, practice sessions, grandmotherly interventions, championship games, and fights.<br />Oh, did I say \\"fights\\"?<br />The book is a simple read and should satisfy the fan and non-fan alike.<br />The one part of the work that stands out in light of Williams's current situation comes at the end of the segment entitled \\"Never Trouble Trouble\\". The author states in this section that he avoids trouble on the road by staying in his hotel room.<br />He writes:  \\"Now if people want to get wild and throw a party, get crazy, they have to come do it at my house.  I'm not always an angel.  But if I'm a devil at home, no one gets hurt.\\"<br />I'm sure that the author now regrets those particular words.	2002-06-29

It is a tale that is part social and religious commentary, part coming-of-age story, part crime story, and part romance. This book has it all.<br />Joey (later to become \\"Joseph\\" as he matures emotionally and physically) is the main protagonist: a high school wrestler, jockeying between his familial role, his loyalty to his teammates, his Catholic upbringing, and his emerging romantic feelings toward one of his peers.<br />The author skillfully handles all these converging factors to a satisfying conclusion that makes this a book that deserves an arm raised in triumph!	2002-06-17

Life magazine, long a chronicle of the major events in American history and pop culture, has done it again with striking photography and heart-wrenching profiles of the many heroes of that pivotal day.<br />Featuring an introduction by former New York mayor Giuliani and a poem by laureate Maya Angelou, this book is a must-have for present and future generations. Its poignant text and attention to detailing the events as they occurred make the book a handy, if emotionally charged reference work.<br />Not enough recommendations can be given to this sure-to-be award-winning publication.	2002-05-17

The bond of love shared by the elderly couple and the little girl remained even through the difficult times following Aunt May's passing.<br />Written in the first-person singular, the book made me truly feel as though I were experiencing the thoughts of a little girl that bore the responsibility of helping her uncle cope with death.  The vivid descriptions of life in the West Virginia community and reflections on school are assets to be enjoyed by the reader.<br />Cletus provides the needed \\"comic relief\\" in a story that deals with death.  Cletus is a \\"pack rat\\" that accumulates odds and ends in a series of satchels.  He collects old newspapers, photographs, brochures, and advertisements.  It is from this assortment that he tells Uncle Ob about the psychic that might be able to reach Aunt May.<br />Even though the trip to Charleston does not yield the intended \\"meeting\\" with Aunt May, Uncle Ob receives a new lease on life.  The underlying message here is that the dead are best remembered for the life that they led.  The living should continue as best as they can; lives should not be spent in mourning.<br />This is a powerful story told with straightforwardness and compassion.<br />If one criticism must be cited, it is the use of a few profane words in what is classified as a \\"children's book.\\"  I realize that children's literature has changed significantly since my youth, but I fail to see the inclusion of one or two curse words to be necessary.<br />Call me \\"old-fashioned,\\" but reader/parent beware.	2002-03-15

It tells of two warring countries divided by a great wall.  The similarity between the East and the West of pre-fall of the Berlin Wall is evident to the plot.<br />The Zooks on one side of the wall eat their bread with the butter side down; the Yooks on the side eat their bread with the butter side up.  This is the reason for the conflict.  Each side feels that theirs is the correct manner for eating bread.  Becoming suspicious of each other, they construct this wall and devise military means to defend themselves from any attack from the other side.  Humorously, the author portrays military strategists as obsessive little men that endlessly work in backrooms creating greater weapons of destruction.<br />The story ends with the two opposing generals facing each other with the ultimate bomb that will destroy the enemy's land.  The grandson of one general asks the question, \\"Who's going to drop it?\\"  The reply is, \\"Be patient...we will see.\\"<br />A powerful statement is this for it raises questions about our own relationship in the World Order.  Dr. Suess, known for his whimsical excursion into fantasy and lyrical rhyme, has not abandoned these elements.  He has just expanded his horizons by writing a children's book for adults.  This work should be required reading for military and government leaders worldwide!<br />The theme of acceptance of differences is the key to this story.  When one realizes this, then peace truly will exist on this planet.<br />How necessary is this since the event of 9/11!	2002-03-09

Maya, like many children, thinks that the \\"store-bought\\" dress is better than the homemade one! How wrong she is!<br />The book is illustrated in beautiful watercolors; the characters are realistically drawn with expressive faces that add depth to the respective personalities.  The author also has a balance of ethnic groups present at the party.  This is an obvious attempt to promote racial tolerance - an asset to the storyline.<br />The text is written with simple vocabulary.

Told in chapter form, the young reader can really develop an understanding of how stories are presented with self-contained sections.  Even though it is a children's book designed for the beginning reader, the theme of the importance of caring can be related to the lives of all.<br />Mr. Sendak's use of verse adds to the lyrical quality of the selection.  Children will really like the choice of words and they may relate to Pierre, who reminds me of how children sometimes reject authority as a means of asserting their independence.<br />By having the lion enter the story adds an element of fantasy that is another attribute of the story.  The moral at the end provides the child with a glimpse of another literary element that will be encountered by children during their more advanced studies of literature.	2002-03-09

Looking at the copyright date, I discovered that it was written forty years ago. It is the kind of book that, as a child, I would have readily selected as a \\"must-read.\\"<br />\\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" reminds me of a very good \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode. Like that classic television program, the book combines elements of science fiction with a morality play. The themes of love overcoming all and family unity are clearly revealed in L'Engle's storytelling.<br />Also, using familiar literary quotes and foreign language statement by the Mrs. Who character added uniqueness to the reading. As a book geared for the younger set, I find this to be suited for a well-read individual. I am not sure if the average reader will appreciate such references.<br />The scientific and mathematical jargon used by the parents and the three women is never overwhelming. If one ever watched \\"Star Trek,\\" one is accustomed to meaningless words that sound authentic.<br />The strength of the characters and the vivid details of the different creatures, along with the well-described alien landscapes, make for a captivating read.<br />If one likes sci-fi with a message, this is the book for that interest.	2002-03-09

It is an accurate piece of historical fiction, dramatizing the events and people that filled the early days of colonial America.  It is compassionate in its approach to the irony and hypocrisy of the times.  It is a fitting tribute to all slaves who endured unspeakable hardships from slave to free man.<br />The author begins the story with Amos's life, as Prince At-mun, in the wilds of Africa.  The subjugation into slavery and the trip along the Middle Passage is told with accuracy and strength.<br />As an African-American, I was moved by the enduring qualities exhibited by this man, his unwavering desire to be free, his longing to help others, and his pride in himself.<br />All the characters in the book are representative of the citizens of the day.  The book is noticeably free of the vilest of the slave owners, but the thought of forced servitude by one man on the other is horrible enough.<br />Descriptive writing of the setting makes the reader feel that he or she is in the hold of the great slave ship, is walking along the busy port cities of New England, and is enjoying the majestic beauty of New Hampshire's mountains.<br />Amos Fortune never really resigns himself to the fact that he is a slave.  This constant vigilance for self-rule is the abiding theme throughout.  A strong sense of independence is presented in the man's words and deeds.<br />The novel provides the reader with a realistic view of how things really were.  By also including the language used in documents of the period, the author contrasts the brevity of modern tongue with the wordiness of colonial times.  This enhances the authenticity of the text.<br />The book is a triumph of man over adversity.  It is a worthwhile addition to any child's literary background.	2002-03-07

She has populated her story with believable characters in a realistic setting with obstacles to overcome that were prevalent in most of Europe during the Occupation.<br />Although the work is one of fiction, the characters are representations of people that actually braved Nazi terror.  Annemarie represents all children that are devoted to family and friends.  Kirsti, the younger sister, has an innocence and feistiness that is common to small children.  Peter, as well as the deceased older sister Lise, is symbolic of the courage of youth.  The parents, Mama and Papa Johansen, are the models of reason and practicality.  Even the Germans are a combination of the \\"good\\" and the \\"bad.\\"<br />Lowry has researched the subject carefully and thoroughly.  In the book's afterward, she reveals that facts are behind much of the story's events.  She mentions how the Danish people were actually devoted to their king, how the Danish fleet was burned in the harbor to prevent use by the marauding Germans, and how the dog-repellant \\"handkerchief\\" was a weapon of the Resistance.<br />I found myself immersed in the lives of these characters and their emotions.<br />Several elements of tension highlight the story: the initial confrontation with the Nazi soldiers; the nighttime raid of the Johansen home; the train ride to Uncle Henrik's as the soldiers question all riders; the search of Henrik's home during the \\"funeral;\\" and Annemarie's trek to her uncle's to deliver the package.<br />By having Annemarie face danger, the author is able to show the young reader that anyone can be a hero whenever the situation calls for brave acts.  This theme makes this a worthy piece of children's literature.<br />The author's prose is direct, interesting, and involving.  The reader can feel for the characters as he/she reads their interactions with each other as well as their thoughts.

The author has woven a very real tale about people that change due to their interactions with each other.<br />The central character, Mary, undergoes a transformation that she, in turn, causes her cousin to do, likewise. Both children begin to see that the world is not centered on them and they hold their own \\"keys\\" to unlocking the wonders of life. This growth is an essential element in the story.<br />Even the supporting characters play an important part in the telling of the story. Mrs. Medlock is comparable to all the servants that Mary has had in the past - those that just did as they were told. Martha's friendliness was instrumental in the charges in Mary's personality. Dickon sparked in Mary her first \\"crush.\\" Uncle Archibald represented Mary's distant parents.<br />The story effectively transports the reader to the dark English moors with its constantly rainy days. The immensity of Misselthwaite Manor is described in great detail.<br />Language of the characters ranged from the learned diction of Mary and her uncle to the \\"common\\" tongue of Martha, Ben, and Dickon. It is quite amusing to read the different accents and phrasings.<br />The highlight of the story is when Colin's ability to walk is revealed to his father. This very emotional event is handled with compassion and delicacy. The reader can visualize the expression on the father's face as he sees his son stand for the first time.<br />The true \\"secret\\" of the garden is not in the foliage that grows within; it is that one's life can blossom if there is caring and faith to help it grow.	2002-03-07

It is a thoroughly entertaining book with believable characters coping with an unbelievable situation.<br />The Tucks are presented as an average \\"hill family\\" whose discovery changes their lives forever.  The eldest son Miles outlives his wife and children.  The entire family has to live a nomadic life for fear that others will notice that they don't age.  This causes them to see eternal life as a curse.<br />Winnie, who longs for a more exciting life, is in awe at first when she learns of the Tuck's uniqueness.  She later learns that it is best to live one's life fully as it was intended.  This is a clear message that the author conveys to the reader.<br />Even when the Tucks take Winnie to their home, the \\"kidnapping\\" is downplayed as a necessity to maintain the secret.  The Tucks are simple folk who unselfishly wish that no one else be burdened.<br />Babbitt's storytelling is straightforward and contemporary.  In an age where the pursuit of youth is idolized, she carefully balances the good and bad of such admiration.  Never becoming preachy, the story cleverly presents its theme of acceptance of one's life and making the best of it.<br />Although it is an enjoyable read, there are some reservations about assigning it to younger readers.  Winnie's initial conversation with stranger Jesse may send the wrong signals to impressionable youth.  Likewise, the \\"kidnapping\\" could be traumatic in light of present-day child abduction cases.  The \\"murder\\" of the man in the yellow suit is another element better suited for a more mature reader.  The book appears better suited for upper middle school and high school readers.	2002-03-07

Marty is a compassionate soul whose \\"hunting\\" is more of the investigative nature than the actual killing of an animal.  This aspect of the boy's character is one of the strengths especially in light of the stereotypical view of all young boys in rural America having a passion for killing.  Showing that it is just as \\"manly\\" to have concern for animals, as it to hunt them, is a concept that Ms. Naylor has cleverly presented.<br />By having the characters speak in the language and manner of the West Virginia hills, Naylor has added authenticity to her prose.  The conversations between the respective personalities are both insightful and entertaining.  As I read the book, I felt as if these were real people speaking to me in their natural manner.<br />Even though the principal is a boy, I am sure that all children, regardless of gender, can relate to this boy's courage and ingenuity.  Marty's devotion to the animal is certainly an attribute that all should aspire to have for others.<br />Because of the dog's presence in the family, there are subtle changes in the family.  Mother and father discover maturity in their son that hey had not seen before; the boy becomes closer to his younger sisters; and Marty realizes that he possesses perseverance and resourcefulness that would benefit him for the rest of his days.  Even an \\"enemy\\" of Marty becomes a respectful acquaintance.<br />When I first began reading the book, I thought that it would take me through familiar territory.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at its originality.<br />I cared for this boy and his dog.<br />Children will also have these same feelings.	2002-03-07

When one considers the trailblazing African-American actors of the past, names like Poitier, Dandridge, McDaniel, Robeson, to name a few, come to mind. However, Woody Strode, an actor possessing one of the greatest physiques in sports/cinematic history, is deserving of a tribute.<br />This autobiography, co-authored by Sam Young, details the varied career of the athlete/actor, from his excursions in football, track, professional wrestling, and his latter work in movies. Filled with interesting anecdotes of working with legends like John Ford, John Wayne, Gregory Peck, and Cecil B. DeMille, the book is a delight for film buffs. Also, the football stories are an essential history lesson on what it was like to be black playing for universities like USC or UCLA, as well as life in the NFL.<br />Strode, with his mixture of various ethnicities, and his quiet yet strong nature would be the perfect candidate for a filmed biopic.

I always felt that to truly say that one is literate is to be able to state equivocally that one has read a book by Toni Morrison or Stephen Hawking.  Sure, Aristotle and Shakespeare are giants, but they were from ages ago. Morrison and Hawking are contemporary thinkers.<br />Instead of dealing with Morrison the storyteller, I chose to read Morrison the academic analyst in the form of \\"Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination&quot;. And, boy, could I not have chosen a more challenging book.<br />Morrison skillfully directs the reader's attention to how American literature abounds with overt and/or covert attempts to perpetuate the white male's superiority and the black man's inferiority. She shows how the \\"Africanist\\" influence can be found in the respective characters, their dialogues, and their interaction with their white counterparts.  By citing examples from Hemingway, Poe, and Cather, the author makes a reader contemplate the author's symbolism and intent.  I know that I will look at \\"great\\" American works with increased scrutiny.<br />I wish that she had tackled Mitchell's \\"Gone with the Wind\\".<br />As one of America's most respected writers and a proponent of civil and women's rights, Miss Morrison uses her talent wisely here in this riveting expos&eacute;.<br />Mind you, there are a few words that not even the context will reveal their meanings; therefore, a dictionary would be handy to have around.  But, the \\"research\\" is well worth it for the book is a feast for the mind.<br />Bring on Stephen now!	2001-12-30

Inasmuch as this reviewer has only read a handful of works on the landmark television show, this book in question stands as the one that can be recommended for its detail to the persons responsible for making &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; an institution.  The actors, the writers, the stories, the scoring and all other areas that went into the production of this classic show are here.  Chopped full of photos and accompanying text, the book should be a part of everyone that has fond memory of the adventures of the Ricardos and the Mertzes.

While I didn't find it rolling-on-the-floor funny, it does have its smile-inducing moments. Basically a series of personal essays about the author's life in North Carolina, New York, and ultimately France, it is filled with amusing bits that can be appreciated by the resident of a country town or an urban dweller.<br />I, for one, could really relate to his dislike of computers and his appreciation for the typewriter. His takes on our fascination with technology, youth, and intelligence are on the mark.<br />The book takes flight in part &quot;Deux&quot; where the humorist relates much about life in France. When he discusses the American couple mistaking him as a Parisian pickpocket, I couldn't stop laughing at these dim-witted &quot;ugly Americans.&quot; His revelation of French customs will be beneficial to anyone planning a trip to that much-visited country.<br />I thank my friend for this introduction.

The book details the production, the episodes, and the various actors featured on the show.  It also reveals the infighting between Serling, producer Jack Laird, and the wishes of the &quot;suits&quot; at NBC.

If any literary giant needs to have his work adapted to film, it is Myers. As one of the premier writers of fiction for juveniles, the author has added another significant piece to his long line of classics. This one tells the story of a little-known African princess who comes under the wing of England's legendary Queen Victoria.<br />Not only does the book reveal the horrors of the African slave trade, the atrocities that some tyrants inflict on their enemies, and the class system that pervades much of a &quot;civilized&quot; society, it is a marvelous tale of a girl who overcomes such obstacles and becomes the darling of English society.<br />Although Sarah's life is brief, it is a memorable one as the character grows from frightened child to a loving mother.<br />I am recommending that all my students read this book as well as others by Myers.

All of the company's major titles and their respective print and filmed versions are featured here, from the &quot;Batman&quot; serials of the 40's to the update 90's television series &quot;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.&quot; For anyone with a passing interest in comics as an entertainment and art form, this is a lavishly illustrated and comprehensive work. In sequential order, we get the full history of DC from its humble beginnings to its status as one of the premier companies in its field. Marvel may have overtaken it in the 60's with its more &quot;adult&quot; characters, DC still reigns as the originator of the comic book and the book supremely showcases that status.	2001-08-06

Like TV's Jessica Fletcher, protagonist Mark Manning lives in a small midwestern town that seems to have its share of big city murders. The latest occurs on the opening night of a play performed by a local theater group. The death of the teen actor parallels the on-stage antics, thus setting up the premise for this installment in the series. Suspects with a motive for murdering the young star abound, chief among these is Manning's own son Thad. It is up to Mark, along with his lover Neil and pal Sheriff Pierce, to find the real killer in order to clear Thad's name.<br />The author embellishes the text with vivid character development, highly descriptive settings, and colorful dialogue. He subtly makes social commentary about the acceptance of individuals that are slightly &quot;off-center&quot; from what is considered the norm.<br />The body count is low in comparison to the best of the series, &quot;Eye Contact,&quot; and the characters are as varied and interesting as those in the last, &quot;Name Games.&quot; In fact, this novel is more closely related to &quot;Body Language,&quot; the one that transplanted Chicagoan Manning to the Midwest. That one also first introduced Thad, as well as solidified the relationship between Mark and Neil.<br />&quot;Boy Toy,&quot; like all in the ongoing mysteries surrounding Manning and friends, is a good read and likely to garner more fans of writer Craft.<br />The only &quot;flaw&quot; is the somewhat &quot;utopian&quot; community of Dumont. It is nice to find a town so refreshingly open-minded in its acceptance of Mark and Neil, but we know that doesn't happen too often in real life. Also, after having had the last three novels take place in the little metropolis, it's time now for Manning to have a little action in a more urban municipality. It's time to take the show &quot;on the road.&quot;	2001-07-23

The book offers an entertaining and totally engrossing look at the legendary film.  Judy, Ray, Jack, Bert, Margaret, and Toto, too, are all analyzed in this brilliant work.  The songwriters, the respective directors, the many other craftsmen, as well as the &quot;little people,&quot; in more than the figurative sense, are all here.  Vividly embellished with stills from the production, the book's text is just as captivating. The familiar as well as the unfamiliar stories about the production make for a most satisfying read for any \\"Oz\\" fan.  It is also a good primer for anyone with an interest in pursuing film as a career.	2001-07-14

Slow in pacing, confusingly organized, and hurt by the first person narrative style, the novel, like others have stated, is not a true parody.  It is, however, one to be read and discussed for it does present another perspective, albeit, like the original, the &quot;view&quot; is slightly flawed.<br />A better &quot;parody&quot; is the classic skit from the &quot;Carol Burnett Show&quot; entitled &quot;Went with the Wind.&quot; Vicki Lawrence's turn as &quot;Cissy,&quot; the slave who &quot;knows nothing about birthin' no babies&quot; had more bite than Randall's novel.<br />I was hoping for more from this one.	2001-07-08

Why Most MEN Don't Go to Church.&quot; This is not to suggest that he change a single iota of his prose; it might assure a wider readership and better sales. Even if he is concentrating primarily on the black man, Mr. Kunjufu's examination of the smaller male numbers in the church can apply to the mainstream, namely white, population. Perhaps a follow-up should be written to encompass the entire American public.<br />The book offers suggestions that each contemporary church should consider in attempting to draw the men into the fold. Placing much of his emphasis on Afrocentric teachings and Bible passages, the author has written a thoughtful and dynamic work which should be in the library of every minister, parishioner, and other interested parties in the growth of the church.	2001-04-14

However, one must wonder what the author's purpose was in writing a book that is not likely to receive crossover appeal, thus the need to &quot;expose&quot; the Black Church.

Included are many less known mammoth structures from foreign lands, such as Malaysia's Petronas Towers, touted presently as the tallest of all, and the uniquely designed Bank of China in Hong Kong.<br />When one says, &quot;The sky is the limit,&quot; the pages of this book showcase the adage perfectly.	2000-10-01

Intrepid journalist Mark Manning returns in a fourth novel of mystery that  deals with another celebrated murder among the citizenry of the small town  of Dumont, Wisconsin.  As was with his last novel, author Craft continues  his first-person narrative style that is actually becoming a technique that  makes Manning such an interesting character.<br />Many of the characters  from previous novels - the ones who aren't dead, of course - make return  appearances in this work: Neil, Mark's lover of three years; Roxanne, a  lawyer friend from Chicago; Thad, Mark's newly acquired \\"son\\" from the last  adventure; Lucy Haring and Glee Savage, employees of the Dumont Register,  Mark's newspaper; Doug Pierce, the local sheriff, and Merriam Westerman,  radical feminist and Manning's chief adversary.<br />Along with these, Craft  introduces us to several other intriguing characters that make the town of  Dumont a haven of deceit and murder.  Although only one killing occurs, the  list of suspects is long.  At one instance, with all the twist and turns  that the novel takes, I was beginning to think that our protagonist,  Manning, may have been the guilty culprit.<br />But, in his usual brilliant  style, Craft strings us along until a very satisfying end, intermittently  throwing in a few glimpses of \\"domesticity\\" in Manning's life with Neil and  Thad.  This touch never distracts from the mystery at hand; it serves to  show the less showy aspects of everyone's day-to-day experience.  The fact  that the household is far-from-traditional is never sensationalized. In  fact, with the modern \\"family\\" being as diverse as it is, Craft simply is  presenting life that is probably more widespread that is commonly  known.<br />Michael Craft deserves a much wider audience.  His second novel,  \\"Eye Contact\\" should have been the one to catapult him to great acclaim.  However, the subsequent \\"maturing\\" of Manning and company may grasp more  fans and propel the author to his rightful place among America's  readers.<br />Maybe, if Craft decides in some future piece to make Thad a  little bespeckled adolescent who uses magic to thwart evil...among America's  readers.<br />Maybe, if Craft decides in some future piece to make Thad a  little bespeckled adolescent who uses magic to thwart evil...	2000-09-10

Walker. A monumental tribute to the concept of self-determination and intestinal fortitude, the story of Madam Walker is inspirational and totally captivating. Miss Due expertly carries the reader from Walker's humble and devastating post-Civil War beginnings through harsh economic and social struggles to world-wide acclaim as the first black female millionaire. Along the way, Madam Walker rubs elbows with the likes of pioneer educators Mary McLeod-Bethune and Booker T. Washington, composer James Weldon Johnson, social activist W.E.B. Dubois, the great opera star Caruso, who is credited with naming Walker's estate, and, to a lesser extent, President Theodore Roosevelt. But, it is not just the famous who are instrumental in the making of this truly outstanding woman. Her parents Owen and Minerva Breedlove, siblings Louvenia and Alex, respective husbands Moses and C.J, as well as trusted friends and employees, and adversaries are all vividly characterized by memorable descriptive passages and lines. Whether or not the events of the novel are romanticized to fir the larger-than-life Walker, the book is one that accomplishes the author's intent: i.e., it elevates an American original to her place of importance as one of this country's \\"queens\\" of business and social change.	2000-07-13

That is a time when children are so impressionable.  That which is trivial to an adult is of great importance  to child; therefore, the story has a relevancy for all who care about and  deal with children.<br />Tamika reminds me so much of my niece who really  adores her grandfather, my dad.  As I turned the pages, reading the text  and admiring the beautiful illustrations, I could only imagine how my niece  would react to the unfolding events.  This is a sign that the book can have  meaning for all.<br />Miss Greenfield has used clear vocabulary that  successfully tells her story to the young reader.<br />The book comes highly  recommended!	2000-06-30

Author Hoffman has captured that innocence in this superb tale.  Grace, like so many youngsters, spends much of her day in the pleasures of \\"acting out\\"  the characters that populate the pages of the books she reads.  She feels  that she can do and be anything that she desires.  The theme of pursuing  one's dreams is the type of message to which all can relate.<br />As one turns  the pages of this beautifully illustrated book, one can enjoy the little  girl's imaginary adventures.  When Grace learns of the part in \\"Peter Pan,\\"  the reader is able to identify with this as a part of school life.  The  illustrator has also balanced the classroom with children of varied ethnic  and racial backgrounds.  This is a plus in the age of being \\"politically  correct.\\"<br />The language of the book is reflective with the age of the  intended reading audience.  With a little adult help, the average primary  child will \\"read\\" this one with great relish.<br />The resolve of the adults  in the family to encourage Grace in pursuit of her dreams is refreshing.  Most of us let barriers prevent us from doing the same.<br />This is one great  children's book!	2000-06-30

Sendak's flair for the extraordinary and the absurd is continued throughout this particular tale.  As is common with most of his books, Sendak's  artwork is cartoonish and captivating.  Mickey resembles boys in other  books by the author/illustrator.  The three bakers bear a striking  resemblance of Oliver Hardy of Laurerl and Hardy fame.  Contemporary  readers may not recognize this, but the friendly faces on the three will be  comforting for the young child.<br />This is an obvious fantasy for it appears  that the events in the story occur in Mickey's dreams.  Even though this is  not directly stated, the initial setting in the boy's bedroom and the final  return there verify that conclusion.  Children may wish to believe that the  events actually happened and should not be criticized for such  thinking.<br />The illustrations dominate the book withan accompanying  &quot;lyrical&quot; text which adds to the enjoyment of the reading.<br />The  one complaint is the anatomically correct illustration of Mickey when he  lost his clothes.  There are four respective frontal and rear views of a  nude Mickey.  The necessity for this is unclear for it neither adds or  detracts from the story line.	2000-06-30

Ms. Gaines's simple story reflects on the relationship between the niece and the aunt.  It is obvious by their actions that there exists a strong bond between the  two.<br />Children will relate to the easily recognizable activities involved  in the preparation and execution of the trip.  The story also demonstrates,  in the subtle manner, the independence of women.  I find that aspect of the  book to be one of its strengths.<br />The illustrations clearly show the  story's subject matter.  Aunt Martha is a very attractive young woman who  appears to be successful; the niece is an average child with braids and  \\"glowing\\" eyes.  Some of the drawings are reminiscent of camera  angles.<br />In true picture book fashion, there is a minimum of words.  However, this does not lessen the book's value.  Given the proper  motivation, the young reader can supply HIS/HER own words to the  captivating illustrations on the pages.	2000-06-30

Children will enjoy the \\"weirdness\\" of the pictures and will delight in their abundance throughout the text.<br /><br />To truly appreciate the satire, though, the reader should be familiar with the originals.  Perhaps, comparisons can be drawn between both versions that may stimulate children to parody other fables or folktales.<br /><br />By changing certain elements and characters in the original stories, the authors have made the tales more assessable to contemporary audiences.  As I read them, I remembered the hilarious parodies on the old \\"Bullwinkle Show\\" of the 1960's.  This explains the appeal of the book to old and young alike.<br /><br />The book is a marvelous and thoroughly enjoyable reading or listening experience.	2000-06-29

Dramatic.  Humorous.  These are just a few adjectives that can be heaped on this excellent novel for children.  Ms. Paterson has written a book that can stand the test of  time with its multiple themes: conflict resolution, facing reality, the  universal need by all for security, and to a lesser degree, the inhumanity  of man to man.  As Gilly may have put it, \\"This is one damn good  book!'<br />As I began to read the selection, I was unnerved somewhat by  Gilly's frequent uses of profanity.  I thought this be unsuitable in a book  intended for children.  However, as I progressed, I realized that his  provided the reader with an essential character trait of the young lady.  From years of being shuffled from one home to another, Gilly had become  angry and mistrusting of others.  Her language and actions were defense  mechanisms she used to cope with her feelings of unworthiness.<br />I could  relate to the child's prejudices because as an African-American, I have  been witness to some of the same ignorance possessed by the story's central  character.  It is admirable of the author to include such thinking for it  promotes discussion about how we see each other.<br />The supporting  characters are memorable and well developed.  From the kindness of the  overweight Maime Trotter to the poetry-reciting blind Mr. Randolph, the  \\"people\\" in the story are so realistically portrayed that the reader cannot  help but have concern for them. Honestly speaking, I almost shed a tear  when Gilly had to leave her new \\"family.\\"<br />Speaking of Gilly, the young  lady changes from an angry child to a loving individual who discovers that  life is not always the way it's supposed to be.<br />In an era when foster  families and abandoned children abound, this book speaks to all of us.  It  shows how important the family unit is, how children need support, and how  we are dependent on each other.<br />Such a simple message this is,  unfortunately, forgotten by most.nfortunately, forgotten by most.	2000-06-29

He was the ONE who was too radical, too opinionated, and too controversial for my  parents to accept.<br />However, when I saw Spike Lee's masterful motion  picture autobiography, I had to find out more about this man.  I was led to  read the life story in his own words and am I glad that I did.<br />Malcolm X  was an individual who encompassed the rage and the determination of the  black man of the 1960's.  He began, as have so many struggling to survive  in the inner city, as a hustler involved in the numbers game.  This led to  an incareration which brought him into the &quot;light&quot; of Islam.<br />His views changed and he spearheaded much of that movement designed to  faciliate black economic survival and pride.  He was misquoted,  misunderstood, and underappreciated by the very people that he sought to  uplift.<br />The book will bring the reader greater insight into this most  complex human being.  Previous biases about him should be placed aside and  take him for what he was: a Black man with a mission, a mission to instill  integrity and self-sufficiency in a people long denied many of America's  basic principles.	2000-06-10

This volume contains the poets's most respected  works.  Dunbar wrote in a variety of styles, but is most remembered for the  use of &quot;slave dialect&quot; to express the humor, the pathos, and  hardships of the condition of the black man in America.  Highlights include  &quot;When Malindy Sings,&quot; an entertaining opus to a  &quot;sistah&quot; with &quot;nat'chel&quot; singing &quot;o'gans,&quot;  &quot;An Ante-Bellum sermon,&quot; which features a subtle commentary on  slavery, and &quot;The Colored Soldiers,&quot; a haunting piece that delves  into the inequalities of servitude in the United States armed forces.  The  words, though a century old are just as timeless today as they were when  they were originally written.  For me To cite just three in this work of so  many excellent verses is a gross understatement.

Of the 40 titles (White as solo artist,  the Love Unlimited Orchestra, and the girl group Love Unlimited) that Mr.  White has had a hand in, I own 36 of them.  And I will probably add the  remaining to make my collection complete.	1999-11-06

However, I did not realize the superb list of &quot;losers&quot;  who did not collect the coveted statues.  This fine reference work by Roy  Pickard provides an excellent assessment of the distinguished recipients  and the &quot;also-rans.&quot;  It is chocked full of amusing profiles and  anecdotes about actors and film.  The true movie fan who remembers such  film stalwarts as Thelma Ritter, Broderick Crawford, Eve Arden, and Beah  Richards will enjoy reading this book for they-and many others receive  their just due.	1999-09-05

With the current HBO bio starring Halle Berry bringing much-deserved attention on Miss Dandridge, it is fitting that Bogle's definitive book receives recognition. This is a perfect look into the life of an actress who because of her race and the times was not allowed to succeed in an industry limited in its appreciation for people of color. As each page is read, the reader becomes totally engrossed in the life of Miss Dandridge, the people who supported and hindered her, and the important role that she played in opening doors for black actors who followed. Like Jackie Robinson and other \\"firsts,\\" Dorothy Dandridge deserves a place in the history books. This fine book makes a fitting tribute to a legend.	1999-08-24
