I don't understand how this man left his children with her for one minute.  Clearly she was out of her mind from the very begining of their marriage and instead of portraying him as a weak little nerd, Rule would have you believe that Mike was the amazing Superman.	2004-04-04

True, we already know that the snarling Sean Penn is an idiot, and Susan Sarandon and her boyfriend Tim are \\"Big Jokes Walking\\".....it was still interesting to read about these freaks.

While in the early stages of reading this book, I went to see &quot;Monster&quot;.  I was glad to be able to get back to a book that told a thorough story, instead of a rushed account of a tortured soul.  Sue Russell did an excellent job of researching the story of Aileen Wuornos.  From the begining, it grabbed the reader and never let go.  I am a fan of true crime and haven't been able to get my hands on a good book for a long time now.  Even Ann Rule was putting me to sleep.  Without going into the life of Wuornos and giving details of the story, I will tell you this...if you like true crime...if you want to read a good book.....buy this one.	2004-02-21

I reviewed this book awhile back, and now I see it has been deleted.  That's pretty sad since I buy my books from Amazon.  When I bought the book, I didn't realize that it was about stories that were previously written. While there were three new stories, the stories are over 30 years old. I'm a fan of Ann's, I just wish we weren't sold short on this one.  I know this will be deleted again...but I will state my review again:  the book is dull, and a repeat of stories previously written.	2004-02-21

Something I could really get into and not want to put down.  I didn't get a good book.....what I got was a great book.  Well written it kept me interested from start to finish.  I have read so much nonsense that I was begining to wonder if anyone would ever write another good true crime.  Mr. Mitchell explained the story in such a way that in some instances you could feel what was about to happen.  While I have no sympathy for Rex Krebs, I feel his parents should be sitting next to him on death row.  In my opinion, it was the two of them who helped create the monster in Rex Krebs. It's a cautionary tale for women that the boogeyman does exist and he could be around the bend or outside your window.	2004-01-22

Tommy Lynn Sells disgusting road to murder was shocking (to say the least).  One of the strange things is how the killer himself came close to death a few times and managed to cheat it!  How sad for his victims and the rest of the world for that?  If you like true crime and have a strong stomach....this is for you.  There was only one error that was a bit confusing...in one story the victim was called two different names.  I don't know if that was a typo or I missed something.  Other than that, the book was good.	2003-12-31

If standing in the shadow of a sibling is reason to become a murderer then half the country would be out there killing people.  The writer gives a very tabloid type of read.  There is nothing substantial to the book.  John Walsh gave a chapter in one of his books to this story and I remember him describing the room that the three women stayed in.  It was described so chillingly that I got goosebumps.	2003-11-17

Lois McMillan was staying at her parents vacation home with her parents, when her body was found.  Shortly thereafter, her neighbor and his three friends were arrested for the murder.  The men had alibi's and there was no evidence to link them to the crime.  The book gets tedious because it just goes on and on about the Trial.  With no new evidence and no surprise witnesses, I couldn't wait to finish the book and get it over with.  At the end the Author never lets us know her thoughts on what might have happened to Lois.  It seems that she liked the accused and the police, so she remained neutral.  Also, alittle insight into the victim herself would have been interesting. I'm begining to think Ann Rule and the late, great, Jack Olsen are the only ones who know how to write true crime.	2003-11-14

I needed something to read while I waited to pick my kids up from school and 2. Because I remember Janice Dickinson on the covers of magazines when I was a teenager.  I didn't expect much just something to pass the time.  However, it was quite engaging and while some might have wanted dirt on other celebrites, Janice remained a class act just telling HER story and no one elses.  I found myself just wanting to give her a hug (I'm a woman and a mother) you couldn't help but wanting to do that after reading what she endured in her youth.  But Janice is a fighter and the kind of girl you could hangout with and have a few laughs.  She's honest and her honesty is what makes her likable.  You can't help but root for a happy ending for this woman!	2003-11-08

You have 5 young victims brutally murdered and remaining unsolved for years until a dedicated Investigator finds the killer.  While I do believe giving the reader more insight into what made Faryion Wardrip tick, the book was nonetheless a page turner from start to finish.  I don't believe however, that Wardrip just went off on these women.  I believe he stalked them, knew their habits and when he could catch them off guard.  It's a shame that the mousey faced Wardrip caused so much pain for so many people and was able to escape justice for so long.  The world needs more people like Investigator Little.  Read the book, you won't be disappointed.	2003-10-16

The wormy little Roth made it a habit of physically abusing his young son and mentally abusing woman that came within 50ft of him (let's not forget killing two of them).  In between, he found time to seduce the preteen daughter of his good friends.  The story is interesting although I would have liked to know more about Randy's youth since there had to be a time when someone said: &quot;That kid's a nut&quot;.

There seems to be one factor with these men: money. In the last two books written by Ms. Rule the women seemed to enjoy the flow of money while forgetting the fact that there were wives, double crossing and murder going on. <br />This story is no different. A crackpot Surgeon operates in the basement of his Office, finally killing a young Mother. All the while his \\"poor victim\\" wife stands there. Didn't she realize there was something wrong with the stooge when he was never accepted into any of the Hospitals he worked? When his license was taken away? When one of his operating assistants was a 17 yr old boy? And finally, when she was asked to assist him in monitoring his patients? I don't know about you, but those would have been some big clues for me that he was nuts.<br />But once again, the Mrs. was so in love that she didn't realize what a jerk her husband was, not even after the doctors found out she had Arsenic in her blood. I guess it had nothing to do with the house, the fancy car or the private school her kids attended. As for the rest of the book, some of the stories are over 30 yrs old, what's up with that?. I used to be a fan of Ms. Rule's, now I think she's just throwing them out there. ...	2003-01-13
