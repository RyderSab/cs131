Jagged lines indicate the edge of continents, thick dotted lines (bright red) indicate language boundaries, and the languages themselves are in a headache-inducing color palate  -- aquamarine next to pink next to purple. There is no way that any competent graphic artist would turn out such a project, unless he/she had a grudge against the company and wanted to get revenge by producing the worst maps possible.  But didn't any editor notice? <br /> <br />If I had seen the maps before I bought this book, I wouldn't have. <br />	2005-08-20

As such, though there is some useful information about film and production techniques and quite a lot on the furor over letterboxing, the most interesting parts of the book allow us to relieve specific moments in recent movie history, for instance, getting glimpses into the thought patterns of fans before, during, and after &quot;Water World.&quot;  <br />I would have liked a little more context to some of the columns; after all, some of the hot topics of 1996 are all but forgotten today.  Also, I always thought of Ebert as an extreme political conservative, in opposition to his late partner, the liberal Gene Siskel.  So how come he reprints hate letters from political conservatives?	2003-08-07

I thought this would be about the making of bad movies -- interviews with actors and directors, discussions of backstage business, and so on.  Nope, it's yet another book of reviews of bad movies.  But while Roger Ebert and others assume that lots of people watch movies, these guys state explicitly that the only people who watch movies are heterosexual men.  Emphasis on the heterosexual.  Boy, are they heterosexual!  Evidently the only reason the authors -- or anyone else -- watch movies is to get a glimpse of cleavage. <br />Gee, I thought a few heterosexual men occasionally thought of something besides cleavage -- guess not.

Most are \\"glamour\\" shots, face and torso, with only very occasionally a shirt unbuttoned or removed. Some curious omissions, and some extremely curious inclusions, but I guess beauty is a matter of personal taste.<br />However, the commentary is terrible. No discussion of the social and cultural trends that impacted concepts of male beauty, just insipid rantings and quotes with no citation.  And Reuters is oddly homophobic.  Over and over, he tells us about \\"armies of female fans (and I'm sure a few male)\\" and \\"eyes that made women (and a few men) melt.\\"  Why are the male fans dismissed over and over in tentative asides in a book marketed specifically to them?  How about \\"armies of male and female fans\\" and \\"eyes that made men and women melt?\\"<br />It also seems very curious that the biography paragraphs (in such small print that you need a magnifying glass to read them) closet every gay star except Sal Mineo -- even Liberace is merely the subject of \\"rumors.\\"  Does Reuters believe that we won't buy the book if we discover that Liberace, Troy Donahue, Rock Hudson, Ramon Novarro, et al. were gay?	2003-04-25

The thematic approach makes it more engaging and readable than \\"Alternative Channels.\\"  But there are many errors and exclusions. The Room 222 episode \\"What is a Man?\\" aired December 3, 1971, not March 4, 1971.  The Family episode \\"Rites of Friendship\\" aired December 28, 1976, not September 28, 1976.  And that's just the ones I checked.  <br />Several exclusions come immediately to mind: a stereotypical gay man named \\"Judy\\" on \\"Medical Center\\"; a gay photographer who fails to exercise interest in Jennifer on \\"WKRP in Cincinnati\\"; Robert Reed as a gay mystery writer on \\"Murder, She Wrote\\"; an auto mechanic who brings a same-sex date to a concert on \\"That 70's Show.\\"  Of course, no one has to include everything, but again I wonder what else the author missed.<br />Finally, the author frequently uses the outdated and offensive term \\"homosexual\\" in reference to gay persons.

Not because of the academic jargon -- there is little or none.  Because he kept dropping in names of obscure punk rock groups or fan mags or ezines and expecting me to know all about them, he kept starting discussions in the middle, and most infuriating, he assumed that readers positively worshipped Elvis, so if he alluded to what happened in Tupelo in 1957, or Elvis' relationship with his cousins, we would nod and say &quot;oh, sure.&quot;  Casual readers, beware -- in order to understand this book, you need to have read at least a dozen biographies of Elvis, watch all of his movies a dozen times, and have every word of every song he ever wrote memorized.

Highly disappointing, mostly a retelling of the story.  Tolkien fans will find this a superfluous rehash of tired ideas, and non-fans will just be bored. Tolkien's Elves are not the flittery creatures of Victorian storybooks?  Middle Earth is a translation of the Old Norse/Anglo-Saxon term for our world?

If this book is for Tolkien aficionados, it needs to be about 100 pages longer, with a better scholarly apparatus, or at least an acknowledgement that other people have written about these books before.  If it is an attempt to capitalize upon the movie, it needs to be a lot more entertaining.	2001-11-06

Same-sex desire can cohere into many different identities -- we've known that since Foucault.  Same-sex behavior often does not cohere into an identity at all -- we've known that at least since &quot;Tea Room Trade.&quot;  So why does Browning present it as a remarkable revelation that he has just now thought of, and that will come to the reader as a shocking revelation?  This is a well written book, but interesting accounts of pansexual Arcadias are unfortunately interspliced with annoyingly self-absorbed tales of his tricks -- Browning believes that he is hot enough to attract every guy in the world, straight, gay, or whatever, and that the reader is desperately interested in hearing the details.   I can buy better porn elsewhere -- but my problem with this book is not that there are many ways to express same-sex desire, not that there is gay life beyond the Castro Street clones with gym memberships and charge accounts at Ikea -- who'd want a world where everybody is the same?  But Browning continuously states that those clones have no right to exist, that they are inauthentic, self-absorbed, sex-obsessed closet bisexuals.  Gay life should should not ever include muscles, circuit parties, and political activism.  In fact, there should be no gay people, anywhere, ever, just promiscuous pansexuals going with the flow.  In a less enlightened age, we would call such rantings homophobic.	2001-07-22

He exhumed hundreds of long-forgotten films, from moody German expressionism through the fluffy bedroom farces of the 1950's, and created an invaluable survey of the way movies look at gay people, comparable in scope to Donald Bogle's survey of African-Americans in film, &quot;Toms, Coons, Mulattos, Mammies, and Bucks.&quot;  We desperately need an update, but for everything from Laurel and Hardy shorts to &quot;Personal Best,&quot; this is the place to go.	2001-07-13

There were a few tomes about great historical figures who happened to be gay, and Jonathan Katz's landmark &quot;Gay American History,&quot; but virtually nothing about the gay men and women after World War II who fought amazing hostility, made countless strategic errors, suffered profound personal losses, and still managed to organize a movement that changed the way we all view individual rights in a civil society.  Even publishing the first edition in 1983 was an act of courage.  <br />Today gay history is a thriving discipline, and the story has been told countless times, often more engagingly. For general readers, I recommend John Loughery's &quot;The Other Side of Silence&quot; and Lilian Faderman's &quot;Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers.&quot;  But for students and scholars, this is a model of historical research and an inspiration.	2001-07-04

Advertising has become ubiquitous, on television, in the subway, on web pages, even on clothing.  Even our ideas and opinions, religions and romances, have become commodified, slanted, and marketed.  And most of the flood of commodification is the product of the postwar communications boom.  Before 1950, one had newspapers, magazines, radio, and the occasional newsreel.  Before 1900, one had placards and fliers.<br />So why is this book exclusively about the 19th century? The 19th century deserves 1 chapter, not all 400 pages. I am only vaguely interested in P.T. Barnum, but fascinated by how Tony the Tiger recreated American breakfasts during the Baby Boom.  Or if Lear wanted to aim his book at historians, why the audacity to title it &quot;a cultural history of American advertising&quot;?  It omits the most interesting eras of American advertising.	2001-07-04
