The author manages to combine all three spirits in this quick read.<br />This makes a great introduction to Einstein. He's portrayed as an important American icon. This book focuses on his legacy rather than his achievements or lifestyle (there's a little about those aspects of Einstein's life too. <br />Light is also shed on the elusive Thomas Harvey, who took Einstein's brain after performing the autopsy. Instead of being the crazy scientist from urban legends, I got the impression that Harvey is a semi-gruff man with a good heart. You can form your own conclusion.<br />While traveling across the country with parts of Einstein's brain, Paterniti makes some self-discoveries. Although that's not what the reader came into this book expecting, it makes a good touch to this already excellent read.	2002-08-14

I was especially surprised later on when much adultery occurs. What made it shocking was that this book is on my high school's summer reading list. Why would the curriculum allow for a book that evolves around adultery, I wondered.<br />Then I realized that this book is a lot more than that. To the younger generation of readers, Rabbit Run can serve as a warning. A warning to stay out of certain types of relationships and to get out before it's too late. <br />The prose in this book is wonderful, bringing every scene to life. Updike manages to describe every character in a manner that begs us to like them. Even so, the reason I'm not giving Rabbit Run five stars is because none of the characters are true &quot;good guys&quot;. In life, this is also true, but in books, I like to have someone to care about.	2002-08-12

Though I'm a high school student, I understood this book. The authors gave good examples for each type of problem for each section. There are 100 plus review questions for each section. The answers to every single odd numbered question in the back of the book.<br />Diagrams included are extremely helpful. Definitions and important theorems stand out because they are placed in blue boxes. My only complaints are that some examples don't exactly walk through the entire problem and that the wording of some definitions are verbose.	2002-08-11

It was a great decision. <BR>Though this book goes slowly (took me a week to read), it doesn't feel slow. Steinbeck's lavish descriptions of the lush California transport me there. <BR>But this book isn't meant to revolve around the plot. The characters drive the plot, not the other way around. I agree that the many of the characters are hard to relate to, but I can understand them. From the most evil character, Cathy, to nice guy Sam Hamilton, I could see why they chose to commit each action. The youngest characters in the book, Abra, Aron, and Cal, are easier to relate to by teenagers such as myself.<BR>Though this book was written half a century ago, the themes are timeless. There is the battle between good and evil, which encompasses sub themes like jealousy.<BR>Overall, this is a book that's worth your time.	2002-08-11

She's even further from the stereotypical teenage girl. The movie, I thought, glamorized Mia's situation.<br />Another plus is that the Princess Diaries is hilarious! I don't often find myself laughing out loud in the middle of a novel.<br />Those of you who are skeptics should try this book anyway because it's very short too.	2002-08-09

It's the same cast of characters - the sorceress Polgaria, her sorcerer father, Belgarath, and a young boy named Garion.<BR>The three, along with their entourage of other exciting characters, continue their quest to stop the evil God Torak from getting hold of the Orb of Aldur, that will allow him to take over the world. So far, this plot is cliched, but there are many interesting mysteries and sub-plots Eddings introduces in this book. Torak, though the main villain, is never actually introduced in this book - only in the prologue. There are plenty of other bad guys, however, to keep a reader entertained.<BR>Many mysteries from the last book ar resolved. What is Asharak up to? Who has the Orb? But new myseteries are introduced. What does the serpent queen want? What are Garion's new powers for? <BR>Overall, this one's very satisfying and could stand on its own. It makes me eager to read the next installment too.	2002-08-09

We, as the readers, know who those two people really are, but Garion doesn't.<BR>Not too many wild things happen in this book as does the next few books in this series, but it's worth your time before you start the other books. <BR>Though at first I wanted Pawn of Prophecy to be over quickly since it was boring at parts, near the end, it picks up and ends at an unsatisfactory place that left me wanting more.	2002-08-09

Reading the back of the book, I thought the Pilot's Wife would contain much mystery and excitement.  In fact, the book was fast paced, but didn't get truly exciting until half way through. <br />The ending was also extremely predictable.  It was unsatisfactory as well.  There is a character mentioned in the middle of the book whom the reader thinks will be more involved, but isn't.<br />The only good parts about The Pilot's Wife is that it's not boring and that the reason for the plane crash is a good explanation.	2000-11-18

In fact, it is book with a profound theme.  It's a book with romance, some suspense, many twists, and a some sad scenes on top of it all. After reading this book, the reader either sympathizes with Victor or the monster.  I thought Victor wasn't an extremely complex character who just has to deal with the wrong choices he's made. This book wasn't extremely dry, only superfluous in some parts. I admit, I just read it for my 8th grade English class, but it was one of the better classics I've read for school.	2000-10-23

There is some historical information about Elizabethan England that I enjoyed. The title includes Shakespeare, but not much is said of the playwright in the novel.   This novel starts when a boy named Widge is adppted by a doctor but then Widge is sold to another master.  (I can't tell you who it is).   The author of this book seems to have a lot of information about plays in the Shakespeare time.  The reader will pick up much of it.  The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that a little twist in it is quite predicatable.  The major ending isn't.   If you want something that will take you 2 nights to read, try The Shakespeare Stealer.  It is also good for kids wanting information about Shakespeare.	2000-10-17

In  contrast, Third Girl made me want to put it down and count how many pages  till the end!<br />The thing that bored me about Third Girl was how the older  characters in it kept saying things like &quot;teenagers these days.&quot;   This book was written in the 60s, and that's when most of Agatha Christie's  worst books were written.<br />The plot was ok, but makes you think you have  the answer so you might stop reading it in the middle.  The ending was  really good, but the middle kept repeating the same clues over and over.   <br />If you are planning to sit down for a couple hours and read a book, I  guess you could read Third Girl.  But if you are busy, you won't be able to  finish it.	2000-09-13

Although The Book of Changes has many good stories, the stories weren't as well written as  Stephen Fair.  <br />This collection is pretty good though becuase it covers a  wide area of subjects, and there is something for everyone.  Some stories  are better than others as is the case of every short story collection, but  the better stories in The Book of Changes are a bit hard to grasp.  <br />If  you've never read Tim Wynne-Jones before, you should start with The Maestro  or Stephen Fair.  This short story collection  would be more suitable for  kids than young adults.	2000-08-08

Josh's mother died a couple weeks before Josh  starts his junior year of high school.  He decides to live with his aunt in  Texas.  But before he got there, one driver who picked Josh up beat and  robbed him and left him on the side of the road.  That is where Leone, a  mute woman, finds Josh and brings him to the village of Canara where to go  forward, you must first go back.<br />Soon Josh discovers the people in Canara  are all Melungeons - people of mixed races.  He also discovers a kind girl  named Mavis and befriends a boy named Gil.  But Canara isn't where Josh  belongs.  He wants to go to texas, but can't seem to get out of Canara.   <br />What is happening?  Why can't Josh get out?  And does he really have the  heart to leave Mavis and Gil?<br />I really like Sang spell because it was a  bit creepy, had a little bit of history, dealt with moral dilemmas, and was  totally original.  If you are looking for any of these qualities in a book,  get Sang Spell.	2000-08-04

The book starts off with the two  friends planning to see each other before school starts.  The book begins  well, with Elizabeth's trip to Ohio to visit Tara*.  <br />In Snail Mail No  More, the two girls are also growing mature and start to be interested in  boys.  When the school year starts, they both have the similar problems  with not being able to afford the best clothes and boys preblems too.   <br />In addition, both Elizabeth and Tara* each have one personal problem  that comes with life changing effects.  Many teens and kids will probably  be able to relate to the problems Elizabeth and Tara* have.<br />All teens and  9-12 kids should read this book because, even though the title doesn't make  this book seem that mature, the subject it deals with are.	2000-07-31

The first couple chapters were good because they gave a good account of the author's  life before he became an astronaut.  It seemed like he was bragging a  little about his accomplishments, but I don't blame him.  <br />Later, when he  arrived in Russia, Commander Linerger seemed to complain a lot.  This whole  book didn't have the tenderness of most memoir type books published  nowadays.  <br />I'm not serious about space exploration, so maybe I didn't  appreciate it that much.  But coming from someone who was looking for a  tender account of an event, I chose the wrong book.  This book is probably  more suitable for people out torfind books about space.	2000-07-28

As it turned out, Terminal Man was well researched and had a good story line, but was lacking  exitement.  I could've put this book down at any time.  <br />There seemed to  be 2 plots going on in the book.  The plot about the terminal man himself  developed nicely but not the one about one of the female doctors.  <br />As  for the ending, I expected more of a bang than what actually happened.   There were some things in the book that were predictable, but most of it  wasn't.  If you've read all of Crichton's books except this one, get it.   But if you're a new Crichton reader, start with something else.	2000-07-28

Soon, Toby, the main  character, tries to befriend Zachary.  They don't hit it off at first, but  do after a couple chapters.  I think there are many stereotypes in this  book about some of the townspeople.<br />It was a pretty good book because  the main idea of the story is good, but it has no definite beginning,  middle and end.  You should read this book, if you want something to relax  you and has a happy ending.	2000-07-26

This book is different from other books targeted at teens because it is totally honest and doesn't have stereotypes.<br />The main character is difinetly a wallflower at first, but he kind of comes out of his shell  after making some friends.  This book isn't like a book where there is a  definite beginning, middle, and end.  It really is like a diary of  someone's year in high school.  What I like best is how the author doesn't  try to make being a teen particularly glamorous.  He also doesn't give the  characters dumb problems like &quot;Oh my God, I have a zit!&quot; sort of  thing.<br />I think many kids will be able to connect to at least one  character in this book.	2000-07-25

I've always been interested in mount Everest and have read a couple of books about Everest expeditions before this one.  This one was my favorite though. Every single detail is written about.  If I didn't know better, I  would've thought this book was a piece of fiction with all the horrofic  things that happened.  It's unbelievable how many people were still able to  survive.  This story kind of reminded me of the Titanic in the sense of how  so many things could've been prevented.  All the people you saw on TV after  the Everest tragedy occured are portrayed in this book.  You get to  understand everyone better.  This book is for everyone even if they were  not originally interested in Mount Everest.	2000-07-20

The reason I read this book was because I wanted to know more about stamp  collecting.  This book gave me MORE than enough information, but it was not  overwhelming.

Everyone in need of a good break from life should read this book.  It will make everyone with a  loving family appreciate life a litte more.  Though I read this book  because it was on the summer reading list, it was the best summer reading  book I've ever read.  I can picture this story as a movie.  I hope there  will be one!	2000-07-16

I'm a reader who doesn't particularly like fantasy, but I'veread many fantasy books which people have said are very good.  Most of those I liked, but not this one.  So you want to be a Wizard is good in the first couple chapters, but as the magic gets more intense, I found it hard to follow.  My friends who are into fantasy and sci-fi loved this book, so if you are like them, go ahead, read this book. But if you are like me, and want to try a fantasy book, don't read this.  I recommend Harry Potter and Ender's Game instead.	2000-07-16

It's kind of like her other books since it's about self-discovery, but the setting is  very different.  The main character, Sophie, is interesting and  unique.  She is sailing to England on a boat with male relatives.  Along  the way, there is humor.  Even though this book is vintage Creech, it is  also different.  If you enjoy the other books Sharon Creech wrote, you will  enjoy this book.  I also recommend it to pre-teen girls.	2000-03-26
