The story takes place in a land where men rule during the day, but the night is ruled by goblins and their creatures.  Goblins used to live among men in the open air but they didn't like to pay taxes so they went underground and disappeared it seemed from the world of men all together.  There living in dampness and without light the goblins changed in mind and body until they became short grotesque creatures who hated all men, especially the King and his descendants.<br /><br />Years later the good King who ruled the land at the time of this story had an eight year old daughter named Princess Irene.  It is mentioned that Irene's mother was very sick when she was born, but since she isn't mentioned at all any further in the story it might be implied that she died.  Since her King-Papa, who loved her very much, was constantly away traveling looking after his kingdom, he had to leave Irene in the care of a nurse named Lootie in a small castle, and provided her with all the amenities she would need to be looked after.  He then would come to visit her there often on his travels with an accompaniment of his men at arms.<br /><br />One rainy day when the princess was bored she decided to go exploring the old castle by herself and discovers a stairway leading up to a hidden level of the house.  There she meets her mysterious Great-Great-Grandmother Irene (whom she was named after) secretly living in the house.  Her Grandmother has many magical powers and gives Irene a few small gifts to help protect her from harm.  Her Grandmother also has the power to only let people find or see her whom she wishes to, so when Irene returns to her nurse, nobody believes her when she tells them about her Great-Great-Grandmother.<br /><br />Several days later when the sun finally comes out Irene has Looty take her for a long walk in the mountains to enjoy the fresh air and loses track of time.  When darkness starts to fall the nurse panics and tries to rush the princess home but it won't be in time before the sun is going to set.  No one has seen a goblin in years, but they still fear being out at night just in case.<br /><br />On the way they meet a brave little twelve year old boy named Curdie who was on his way home from working in the mines all day with his father Peter, and he escorts them home.  From working in the mines Curdie has learned all the old ways to protect yourself from goblins so he doesn't fear them.  He tells the Princess and Looty that he believes goblins will leave you alone if you aren't afraid of them, and that more than anything else they hate to hear rhymes.  So all the way home he sings rhymes out loud to scare away any stray goblins.  Irene promises him a kiss as a thank you for his troubles but Looty puts it off for a later time.<br /><br />The story then takes us back to Curdie's humble house where we meet his loving mother and father.  Curdie is trying to save money to buy his mother a new coat for the winter, so the next few days he stays late in the mine and does some overtime work.  During the night he discovers a family of goblins and by spying on them overhears part of a plan the King of the Goblins was working on to kidnap the Princess and to get rid of all of the miners.<br /><br />In order to discover the rest of their plan however, on the subsequent nights Curdie with his pick axe and a hand full of new rhymes has to sneak further into goblin territory.  Not only does he risk having to fight off all the goblins and their pets if he is discovered, but if he loses his way he could be lost forever in the many caverns.  By the time he does finds the King and Queen of the Goblins along with their son Prince Hairlip, and discovers the rest of their plan along with another of their vulnerabilities, he is so far gone into their territory that it looks like he may never make it home again unless he receives a lot of outside help.<br /><br />The Princess then proves to be just as brave as Curdie and comes to his rescue.  Together with the magical powers of the Princess's Great-Great-Grandmother it all leads up to a great battle between the men and goblins.<br /><br />McDonald showed a lot of imagination in writing this great adventure.  I'm sure my girl's who are eight and six will love it.<br /><br />The illustrations by Arthur Hughes were very good, but the goblins look more like silly little gnomes in his pictures rather than the grotesque creatures described in the book.  I guess they wanted to scare the children who were reading the book, but just not that much.nd comes to his rescue.

The first of which was \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\".  Green's talents lie in taking legendary stories that have been retold over and over throughout the years and combining the best of those stories into one cohesive book.  Unlike in \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" however where Green didn't seem to favor any one author over another, and appeared to have a hard time mixing and matching the different writing styles; here Green seems content to be able to heavily rely on the wonderful works of Thomas Malory.  It takes Green sometime however to get to those individual stories.  The first couple of chapters (which I suspect are where Green includes most of the works by his other sources) seem to be a little bland and hard to follow at times, but once Greene is done introducing most of the main characters he then settles down nicely into the individual tales.  At first I was reminded of reading the Iliad where it begins in a similar fashion by introducing you to what seemed like a thousand different characters without any real attempt to give you a feel for any of them.  (I was introduced to 33 Knights in the first 57 pages).  It made it difficult to know which characters you were really supposed to focus on.<br /><br />The novel is split up into four books, \\"The Coming Of Arthur\\", \\"The Knights Of The Round Table\\", \\"The Quest Of The Holy Grail\\", and \\"The Departing Of Arthur\\".<br /><br />Logres (otherwise known as the land of blessing, God's Kingdom upon earth, or plain old England) was constantly at war with the Saxons from Germany and Denmark.  Aurelius Ambrosius, who was one of the last of the Roman Emperors was dead, and Uther Pendragon who was believed to be his brother ruled Briton.  He defeated the Saxons in many battles and brought peace to the land he ruled over which he called Camelot (otherwise known as London).  The peace continued until he fell in love with the wife of Duke Gorlois, who was one of Uther's loyal followers, and was ruling over Cornwall.  Uther wound up going to war against Gorlois and killed him.  Three hours later however, with the help of Merlin the good enchanter, he took the form of Gorlois and met Gorlois' wife the Lady Igrayne at the castle Tintagle and made her his wife.  Merlin watched over their love and from it they had a son.  With Merlin's advise, Uther then allows Merlin to take the boy away in secret to Avalon \\"The Land Of Mystery\\" where he is hidden.  The Dwellers in Avalon who are said to be Fairies and Elves bestow upon the child three gifts.  They were that he may live an exceptionally long life, become the best Knight, and the greatest of Kings these lands would ever see.<br /><br />Uther and Igrayne's time together was short lived however as Uther was soon after this poisoned by a traitor and dies.  Igrayne takes over as queen and evil falls upon Logres more darker than in any previous times.  Uther and Igrayne had no other children together, but Igrayne and Gorlois already had three daughters.  Morgawse and Elaine grew up to marry Kings and their sons wound up being among the bravest Knights of the Round Table, but the third daughter who was called Morgana le Fay, was sent to a nunnery and some how there learned magic and turned wicked.<br /><br />Merlin was away for many years, but at an appointed time he returns on Christmas Day and foretells the coming of the true King of Briton.  He gathers the people together at mass with the help of the Archbishop and introduces a sword stuck in a marble stone and anvil.  \\"Whoso pulleth out this sword from this stone and anvil is the True-Born King of all Britain.\\"  (I found this very weird that the Church and the wizard were both working together.)  All the best Knights in England are then gathered together for a tournament on New Year's Day and they each make attempts to remove the sword but fail.  Later, Arthur, who is only a boy is sent home to retrieve a sword for his brother SirKay who was in the tournament.  When the door is locked he remembers seeing one in a stone along the way that wasn't being used, so he returns to take that one instead.  There used to be guards around the stone, but they had all left to join in the tournament.  Arthur goes up and pulls it out without any trouble and gives it to his brother to use in the tournament.  Their father Sir Ector upon finally realizing it was really Arthur who removed the sword bows down to him and reveals to Arthur that he had been adopted, and that his real father was Uther Pendragan.  On Witsun or Pentecost (the \\"birthday\\" of the Christian church.  It commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles, fifty days after the resurrection of Jesus at Easter, and ten days after the Ascension. It is also known in English as Whitsun or Whitsunday, because of the white robes worn this day by those newly baptized), after it is proved that no one else has the ability to draw the sword, Arthur is made King.  Since he is only a boy of sixteen however, many challenge to take the throne from Arthur, but with the guidance of Merlin he learns from all of his mistakes and prevails.<br />One of the mistakes Arthur had made and learned from was going against King Pellinore even after Merlin advised against it.  King Pellinore at this time was still much stronger than Arthur, and in the battle between them Arthur's sword was broken in two.  With Merlin's assistance however Arthur's life is spared, and King Pellinore later becomes one of the great Knights of the Round Table, but Arthur learned some humility from the experience, and was now ready to do great things.  (This reminded me a bit of the scene in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" when Aragorn stands before Isuldur's broken sword in the House of Elrond).<br />Merlin then introduces Arthur to the Lady Nimue who is the Lady of the Lake and from the lake he receives his new sword \\"Excalibur\\" that was made in Avalon and no one can stand against it.  He is also given a jeweled scabbard and belt that so long as he is wearing it will prevent him from bleeding much in battle.  (Later he also obtains a spear that is never broken that he names \\"Ron\\").  Arthur conquers all those who oppose him, and creates a great Kingdom.  He then falls in love with Guinevere and makes her his Queen.  In the hall of his kingdom Merlin sets up a Round Table, and Arthur invites the bravest Knights to join him.  The round table can hold up to one hundred and fifty Knights.  As each Knight is accepted to the table their names magically appeared on the back of each chair in gold lettering (the names would then fade if any of them were killed).  Four chairs however were reserved for special Knights who would come at a later time.  One of these chairs is called the \\"Siege Perilous\\", since no one can attempt to sit there who was not worthy without risking certain death.<br /><br />Merlin is Arthur's advisor throughout this whole time until his Kingdom is set up and in good hands, but then he goes away.  He says Arthur now has to prove his merit on his own.  Before he goes however he foretells all that is going to happen in the book.  He tells of everyone's great deeds and how each of them is going to die.  He then tells of some betrayals and losses, and Arthur just listens to it all and excepts it.  I hated this part.  There was no Free-will.  Everyone believed in Predetermination, and there didn't seem to be any way they could change their fate.  It seemed very depressing.<br /><br />Each year on the Feast of Pentecost all the Knights who have sworn allegiance to King Arthur returned to Camelot, took their place at the Round Table, and renewed their vows to serve Arthur.  Arthur had made a rule however that dinner couldn't be served that day each year until either he heard of a tale of adventure, an adventure came to them, or they received a request for help.  This was how the majority of each of the individual tales then began.<br /><br />Among the best of the Knights who would come to join Arthur at this table would include Sir Gawain, who was my favorite Knight in the book.  He is one of Arthur's nephews, and can only be surpassed in greatness by Sir Launcelot and the Holy Knight.  His greatest battles in the book, which are also two of my favorite tales, involve \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight of the Green Chapel\\", and \\"Sir Gawain and Lady Ragnell\\".  The story with the Green Knight involves Gawain exchanging blows with a Knight who can reattach his head after it has been cut off.  It very much reminded me of an old Nordic tale I had read years ago but I can't remember the name of it.  The story of the Lady Ragnell involved Sir Gawain marrying a cursed women in order to save Arthur life.  The women looked grotesque during the day, but by night turned into a beautiful princess.  (I'm certain this is also the story line the movie \\"Shrek\\" borrows upon.)<br /><br />Sir Gareth, who is also known as the \\"Knight of the Kitchen\\", would be another of the greatest Knights at the table.  He is Gawain's younger brother.  After proving his worth as a Knight with some great battles against the Red, Blue, Green, and Black Knights, he eventually marries the Lady Linnet.<br /><br />Sir Launcelot is the greatest Knight of the Round Table except for one.  He is involved in many of the tales and does many great things.  He was raised by the Lady Nimue who is the Lady of the Lake.  He it is however that helps bring about the downfall of Logres with his love for Queen Guinevere.<br /><br />Sir Bors De Gannis is a cousin of Sir Launcelot.  He was one of the few who was allowed to proceed upon the quest for the Holy Grail and fights along side  Launcelot in several of the tales.<br /><br />Sir Tristram of Lyonesse is a Cornish Knight who is the son of King Mark of Cornwall.  At times he also disguises himself as a minstrel named Tramtris.  He it is the slays a dragon and falls in love with the fair Iseult from Ireland.<br /><br />Later Sir Percivale of Whales is born.  He is the son of Sir Gawain.  He grew up in the woods, and did not see any other person in his life for fifteen years except for his mother.  He to is one of the few Knights who were deemed worthy enough to attempt the quest for the Holy Grail, and falls in love with Blanchefleur who is the \\"Holy Cup bearer\\".  A similar story to the one in which Percivale first meets Blanchefleur can also be found in one of the \\"Arabian Knights\\" stories called \\"Prince Camaralzaman and the Princess of China\\".  In both stories they exchange rings to both show that they are not dreaming, and to further identify each other later when they meet again.<br /><br />Galahad is Launcelot's son and the Holy Knight.  He was raised by Naciens the Hermit of Carbonek.  He is said to be the Greatest Knight of them all.  I agree he may be the most noble, but besides his quest for the Holy Grail, his other conquests where great but seemed a little hollow in comparison with those already accomplished by Sir Lancelot.  He seemed to have been raised for one purpose in life only, and that was to find the Holy Grail.  The rest of his life doesn't seem to have much meaning to him which seemed kind of sad.  (There were many comparison's to Jesus).  He seemed to be a sacrificial lamb used to free the people from a curse and to return them into the light for a period of time.<br /><br />There are many others named in this book, but the ones I've listed already are the ones you should focus upon while reading the book since they seem to be the ones involved in the majority of the individual tales.<br /><br />Arthur then creates and Order of Chivalry and asks all of his Knights to live up to it: \\"All of you, and those who shall sit afterwards at this Table, are the Knights of Logres, and for the glory of Logres, the Realm of Righteousness do not ever depart from the high virtues of this realm.  Do no outrage nor murder nor any cruel or wicked thing; fly from treason and all untruthfulness and dishonest dealing; give mercy unto those that seek it - or sit no more at this Table.  And always give all help in your power to ladies and damsels, go out to succor gentlewomen and widows, turn from all else to right any wrong done to any women in the world - and never, on pain of death and eternal disgrace, do you any ill thing to a women, or suffer it to be done.  Nor, for love or gain, fight in any quarrel that is not just and righteous.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the book Arthur's Knight's all then try to measure up to this Code of Chivalry, but even the best of them at times have trouble.  Only Galahad the Holy Knight's morals proves to be beyond reproach.<br /><br />At times throughout the book a few of the better Knights find their way to the mysterious Castle Carbonek that doesn't seem to be on any given map.  It is here in one of the upper rooms of this Castle that the Holy Cup that Jesus used at the Last Supper is kept, along with the spear that the Roman Centurion Longinus used to pierce the side of Jesus while he hung on the cross.  King Pelles who is an ancestor to Jesus' uncle Joseph of Armathea is the ruler of Castle Carbonek.  Joseph of Armathea brought the Holy Grail to England and his descendants along with Naciens the Hermit have been the protectors of it ever since.  Due to some curse however the Castle and the lands around it have fallen into ruin.  Only one Knight will be worthy enough to hold the cup that seems to contain the light of God and free them from this curse.  When any of these better Knights arrive at the Castle they are tested in some way.  While at dinner a procession always seems to appear and proceeds around the table lead by a women caring the Grail, followed by the spear that pierced Jesus' side, and on certain occasions then followed by a candelabra which can hold seven candlesticks (I trust this was supposed to represent the seven tribes of Jerusalem).  If the Knights at the table are not worthy they will fall asleep and be unable to see the Grail.  A few prove worthy enough to see it and rise from the table to follow the procession, but still only one is worthy enough to hold it.<br /><br />In the end all of Merlin's predictions come true.  Once the majority of Arthur's Knights have either been killed or turned against each other, Arthur appears to be mortally wounded in the Last Battle by his cousin Mordred who is his sister Morgana le Fay's son.  Morgana repents and turns good but it is too late.  With her assistance however Arthur is placed on an enchanted ship and taken to Avalon.  It is predicted that he will one day return.  (The ending was very similar in the Lord of the Rings as well.)<br /><br />It appeared that there were many other Knights who attempted the quest for the Grail, but Greene only seemed to have enough space in this book to cover the stories of the those who came the closest to achieving the goal.  Since there were supposed to have been over one hundred and fifty Knights at the Round table at one point it would seem there are also several other tales that were told, but you will have to seek them elsewhere beyound this book.  I believe Greene meant to use this novel just as a means to introduce the reader to the world that these tales are told in in order to peak the readers curiosity enought to have them go out and find the rest on their own.  Here I believe he succeeds grandly.oin Arthur at this table would include Sir Gawain, who was my favorite Knight in the book.

This semester's topics include among others, the Catholic Church, Religion, Cults, Physics, Evolution, and the Arts.  You just need to do some follow up on your own to verify which are actually based on any real truth, or are just pure fiction made up for entertainment purposes only.<br /><br />The story is about a physicist named Leonardo Vetra and his daughter Vittoria, who while working at CERN (a real company in Switzerland where the \\"world wide web\\" was invented), have found a viable way to use anti-matter as an energy source.  The physicist is then brutally murdered and branded with an ambigram (which in this case is a graphical figure that spells out the same word whether viewed straight on or turned upside down) by an assassin claiming to be a member of an ancient cult called the \\"Illuminati\\" (who supposedly are old enemies of the Catholic Church).  The assassin then attempts to use the antimatter as a bomb to get back at the Catholic Church by planting it somewhere in the Vatican during \\"Conclave\\" (which is the period of time after a Catholic Pope has died and all of the Cardinals are gathered together in Rome to elect a new Pope).  The four Cardinals who are the leading candidates to become the next pope (also known as the \\"preferitti\\") are also kidnapped by the assassin and he threatens to murder one of them every hour leading up to the explosion that is set to go off at midnight.  The real mastermind behind the plot is said to be a man named Janus (which is also the name of the Roman god of gates and doors, beginnings and endings, and hence represented with a double-faced head) who is actually controlling the assassin.<br /><br />There are two sets of mysteries Robert Langdon (who is a Harvard symbologist and the main character in both this book and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\") can try to solve.  He can either follow the path of the \\"Illuminati\\" by trying to discover the four churches in Rome (out of something like nine hundred) that secretly represent the \\"Altars of Science (Earth, Air, Fire, and Water)\\", where each of the four cardinals are supposed to be executed one by one, or he could try to help solve the mystery of where in the Vatican the assassin has planted the bomb (...we planted a deadly explosive at the heart of your most sacred shrine...).  Since to solve the first mystery he would also need to decipher the code left in a fictitious pamphlet supposedly written by Galileo, I personally felt the second mystery would have been easier to solve; but since the Swiss Guard (who are the sworn protectors of the Vatican) were already using all of their man power to look for the bomb, I guess Langdon and Vittoria felt their efforts would be better served by looking for the Cardinals.<br /><br />Since Langdon and Vetra have less than 24 hours to solve the mystery before the bomb is going to go off, the story moves at a very fast pace and is quite a thrill ride throughout Rome searching for each of the next clues on the path.  By deciphering the pamphlet they discover that each of the four churches that represent the \\"Altars of Science\\" are also marked by a statue that was placed there by Gianlorenzo Bernini who was the greatest architect for the Vatican, and in this book is also suspected of being a member of the Illuminati.<br /><br />We later find out that the physicist who was murdered was also a priest.  Unlike others in the church who looked upon science as an enemy, Vetra was trying to use science as a way to prove God existed.  By using antimatter as \\"pure energy\\" he was trying to recreate the \\"Big Bang Theory\\" on a smaller model to show that you could create matter out of nothing.  If \\"Pure Energy\\" can be scientifically shown to be created when photons are annihilated and anti matter is created (something from nothing) then this could prove that God does exist and that \\"TheBig Bang Theory\\" was correct.  God (Pure Energy) created the world out of nothing.  He can also show that we can return to this state again after death.  If it is proven that there is no eternal being watching and interfering however, the Church might consider this a problem since there would also be no one telling us how we should be behaving yourselves.  (primordial atom = Atom and Eve?)<br /><br />At the Vatican, Carlo Ventresca is the Carmelingo who is in charge of the church during Conclave.  He is represented as a devote Catholic who's mother had tragically died when he was very young, and it was considered a miracle at the time that he himself had survived.  He was then taken in by a kindly bishop who raised him as his own.  He believes he was saved for a higher calling and now finds himself praying for another miracle to save them all from this current plight.<br /><br />Maximilian Kohler is the director of CERN.  Since it is implied that the sign of the devil (666) is hidden in CERN's logo, Kohler is suspected of being an enemy of the Church.  He is restricted to a wheel chair, and at times he is made out to seem more mechanical than man.  (I believe there were also some references made to the Church banning stem cell research which could have lead to a cure for his disease, so he is mad at them for standing in the way of progress.)<br /><br />Then there is Commander Olivetti who is the head of the Swiss guard, and his second-in-command Captain Elias Rocher.  While Rocher (who is compared to a grizzly bear) might be looked upon as a milder version, both he and Olivetti (who is compared to a Viper) are considered to be chauvinistic and closed minded.  When it becomes clear that there is a traitor in the Vatican, their motives and allegiance are brought into question.<br /><br />Unfortunately, by having read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" first, it took away some of this book's originality.  I know this was written first, but since the two books follow a very similar formula (they both start out with a gruesome murder by a member of some sort of cult where the main character Robert Langdon is then forced to team up with the deceased's daughter to help solve the mystery by uncovering a series of clues hidden in ancient Art), I felt as if I had already read this book.<br /><br />After having completed the book I then went out on-line and did some of my own independent study into some of the topics covered in this book and have the following thoughts:<br /><br />  *From reading the book I thought antimatter sounded like a great source of energy, so I went to CERN's web site to find out how far along they were in developing it.  I was very disappointed to find out that there is no possibility to use antimatter as an energy \\"source\\".  Unlike solar energy, coal or oil, antimatter does not occur in nature.  They have to make every particle at the expense of much more energy than it can give back during annihilation.  They said that if you tried to imagine antimatter as a possible temporary storage medium for energy, much like you store electricity in rechargeable batteries, the process of charging the battery is reversible with relatively small loss, but still, it takes more energy to charge the battery than what you get back out of it.  For antimatter the loss factors are so enormous that it will never be practical.  They said that if they could assemble all the antimatter they've ever made at CERN and annihilate it with matter, they would only have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes.  To create the amount of antimatter described in the book they said it would take them about two billion years!  They then said it would then be utterly impossible to contain that amount of pure negative electric charge.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />  *I did see however that CERN's logo does seem to have 666 in it, but then I saw that so does the photo studio that does the school pictures for my girls grammar school.(There logo is a photo lens with three arms outstretched around an inner circle.)  After I saw that I wasn't quite as convinced of CERN's hidden agenda.<br /><br />  *I was also disappointed to have successfully guessed who Janus was halfway through the book, but was somewhat appeased by the fact that at least the motive was different than what I had originally suspected.<br /><br />  *Last week I felt like an expert after the death of John Paul II, explaining to everybody what \\"Conclave\\" was and the whole process involved in electing a new pope.  Most of that seemed to be accurate.<br /><br />  *I did not find any reference anywhere that Gianlorenzo Bernini was ever suspected of being a member of the Illuminati.  In fact I found that he was a very devout Catholic who attended mass twice a day.<br /><br />  *I also found that the Egyptian Pillars that mark the front of many of the most notable sights in Rome were brought there by the Romans as trophies when they conquered other lands, and then Pope Sixtus V (1585-1590) decided to place a cross on top of them as a means to show how the Catholic Church had conquered other religions as well.  When people began to make great pilgrimages to Rome to see all of the major sites, the same Pope realized that since you could see these Egyptian Pillars from a long way off, he ordered them to be moved in front of each of the major attractions to help pilgrims more easily find what they were looking for.<br /><br />  *Over the years there were many groups that called themselves the \\"Illuminati\\", and they all had different beliefs that were closer related to the times they lived in rather to any drawn out plan.  I couldn't find any evidence that any of these societies were ever related.  The earlier group's professed goals were to teach people to be happy by making them good - to do this by enlightening the mind and freeing it from the dominion of superstition and prejudice.  It wasn't until the group founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776 in Bavaria that these goals were not accepted at face value.  Weishaupt with the help of Freiherr von Knigge took it one step further to promote a freedom from church domination over philosophy and science, and called for the destruction of the church.  At the beginning of 1777 Weishaupt entered a Masonic Lodge and endeavored, with other members of the order, to render Freemasonry as subservient as possible to his aims.  Assisted by Amelius Bode and Knigge he labored diligently to convert the whole Masonic body into \\"Illuminated Freemasons\\".  A number of the most prominent representatives of Freemasonry  and \\"enlightenment\\" became Illuminati.  But in 1783 dissensions arose between Knigge and Weishaupt, which resulted in Weishaupt withdrawing from the society on 1 July, 1784.  In 1783 the anarchistic tendencies of the order provoked public denunciations which led, in 1784, to interference on the part of the Bavarian Government.  As the activity of the Illuminati still continued, four successive enactments were issued against them (22 June, 1784; 2 March, and 16 August, 1785; and 16 August, 1787), in the last of which recruiting for the order was forbidden under penalty of death.  In 1785 Pope Pius VI also condemned the order.  These measures put an end to the corporate existence of the order in Bavaria, and, as a result of the publication, in 1786, of its degrees and of other documents concerning it--for the most part of a rather compromising nature--its further extension outside Bavaria became impossible. After 1787 Weishaupt renounced all active connection with secret societies, and again drew near to the Church.  He died on 18 November, 1830.<br /><br />  *The Illuminati in this story are supposed to be an off shoot of the Free Masons, but Free Masons still believe in God.  That is what the \\"G\\" stands for in the middle of their symbol. I also found that Free Mason's didn't start using the \\"great eye\\" as a symbol until after 1789.<br /><br />  *Because Masonic secrecy threatened the practice of confession, and since Masons tolerated membership by people of different religions, all Masons were ex-communicated by the Pope in 1738.

US	51228288	ROM7RS7MMOSQP	0679425330	109044642	Aladdin and Other Tales from the Arabian Nights (Everyman's Library Children's Classics Series)	Books	5	22	29	N	N	As Good As or Better Than the Disney Version	This vast collection of folk tales from India and the Middle East known as \\"The Arabian Nights Entertainments\\" or \\"The Thousand and One Nights\\" is a framework of many tales that were told orally for centuries before finally being written down, so they are not attributed to any one author.  \\"The Story of Aladdin, or The Wonderful Lamp\\" takes up about the first hundred pages of this 346 page book, and the rest of the book is filled with other great stories and illustrations which feature among others, \\"Sinbad the Sailor\\", \\"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\\", and \\"Prince Camaralzaman\\".  Overall this book was extremely well written and entertaining, and I would highly recommend it for both children and adults alike.  \\"The Story of Aladdin\\" is different in several ways from the Disney version but I liked it just as much or more.  It is still the story of a poor boy who falls in love with the Sultan's daughter and with the assistance of a genie from a lamp wins her hand in marriage, but the thing I was most surprised to learn in this book was that Aladdin was actually Chinese, rather then Arabian as he is depicted in the movie.  The Princess was also not called Jasmine, but Princess Badroulboudour.  The Sultan is still her father, but Disney combines three of the book's characters (the African Magician, the Grand Vizier, and the Grand Vizier's son) to create their villain.  There was no \\"Abu\\" the monkey, no flying carpets, and Aladdin although lazy, was no thief.  Additionally there were several different types of genies in this book that inhabited quite a few things other then lamps.  Rather than the nice blue version which Robin Williams plays of a genie in the Disney movie, in this book genies are considered to be big scary enslaved demons.  Some also are more powerful than others.  Depending on how powerful your genie was, rather than being limited to just three wishes, you could give him an endless amount of commands to carry out as long as you weren't ungrateful for the benefit you received in return for them.  I was also surprised to see that Aladdin had a mother who played a big part in the story.  From the movie you would think him to be an orphan.  The tales of \\"Sinbad the Sailor\\" reminded me of the Greek tragedies.  The stories were very good, but Sinbad seemed like a poor man's Odysseus from \\"The Odyssey\\" as he had to battle several monsters, and overcome several misadventures in order to return home.  Just like Odysseus he even has to fight a Cyclops.  I believe Sinbad takes seven trips in all and not once does he have a safe voyage.  I would have thought after the third time this happened that all of the other sailors would have thought him to be a jinx and would have refused to have sailed with him, but for the sake of a good story I guess you have to ignore this type of oversight.  I also think he should have been called \\"Sinbad the Merchant\\" rather than \\"Sinbad the Sailor\\" since he never actually sails any of these ships, but rather just travels upon them.  There is always more than one captain who does the actual sailing.  In one of the \\"Sinbad\\" stories when he is washed up on a desert island, just before he is about to die of thirst and starvation he is rescued by a \\"King Mihrage\\".  I'm curious if this is where the term \\"mirage\\" originated from?  There is also another Sinbad story in which the people he encounters have a custom for their married couples in that if one of them dies before the other, they still bury the living spouse with the dead one.  I think this even covered in one of the Star Trek episodes I saw.  I've never actually read the story of \\"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\\" until now, but for some reason I had always assumed Ali was the captain of the thieves.  I was surprised to find out in the book that he is just a poor man who stumbles upon the thieves hideout by accident in the story and that he is just lucky they did not find and murder him for discovering their secret.  The star of the story is actually one of Ali's slave girls named Morgiana who saves Ali on several occasions by outsmarting the thieves.  There are four type of religions represented throughout this entire book.  There are Mussulmans (which if I'm not mistaken are a type of Muslim), Persians (who worship fire), Christians and Jews.  All of the main characters are Mussulmans.  Since for the most part these are mostly short stories I'm torn whether or not to include them on my listing of the greatest novels of all time, but they certainly are worthy of note none the less.tually one of Ali's slave girls named Morgiana who saves Ali on several occasions by outsmarting the thieves.

US	51228288	R3R10UYILYQ2DB	0679436367	375417672	The Adventures of Robin Hood (Everyman's Library Children's Classics Series)	Books	4	15	18	N	N	A Very Good Take on a Legendary Tale	The author Roger Lancelyn Green wrote this novel in 1956 after bringing together all of the best of the old ballads, romances, and plays about Robin Hood.  He then does a good job of putting all of these legends into chronological order, and doing a lot of editing to make them his own.  This must have been a very difficult task, to which I give him credit.  At times however some of the stories seem very bland as if he was just listing off facts about the main characters, rather than adding any soul or additional emotion to the story himself.  It seems as if he was bored with the early stories when Robin was putting his band of merry men together, and so he just kind of rushes through them as a formality to get to the stories beyond.  I'm sure Green has heard those early stories about when Robin Hood meets Little John, Friar Tuck, and Much the Miller's son a million times himself, so it seems as if he assumed everybody else had already heard them as well.  Green is also weary about treading upon parts of the story that were already better covered in other novels such as Sir Walter Scott's \\"Ivanhoe\\".  I was actually looking forward to seeing a new perspective on some of the characters from \\"Ivanhoe\\" from Robin's perspective, but Green just introduces them and then jumps to the end of the chapter saying that this part of the story is all better covered elsewhere.  If I hadn't already read \\"Ivanhoe\\" I might have been a little more perturbed at that point.  In the later stories to his further credit however he puts his heart more into the tales and the change in writing style is evident.  While all the previous stories and movies on Robin Hood that I have heard of end when King Richard I returns to England and Robin and Marian are married, this one at least adds some new perspective by continuing the saga into Robin's later years.<br /><br />The general story goes that while King Richard the Lionhearted was off fighting in the crusade to free Jerusalem from the Saracens during 1189, he had left the Bishop of Ely to rule England in his absence.  Once Richard left however, his wicked brother Prince John accused the Bishop of treason and forced him to flee for his life.  John then took over as interim ruler of England hoping that his brother would never return.  Prince John and his followers were said to be cruel men.  The Prince accused all men of treason who did not stand by him and took their lands and turned them over to his own supporters.  Robert Fitzooth, the Earl of Huntingdon was one of King Richard's most faithful followers.  He knew John was usurping his authority and longed for Richard's return.  Under the guise of Robin Hood he begins helping those in need who were being oppressed under Prince John's tyranny.  He started to develop a reputation and a following.  A bounty was then put up for Robin Hood's capture, and Fitzooth is betrayed by one of his own men named Wormin (it seems every character I've ever heard of with \\"Worm\\" in their name winds up being a traitor, like \\"Wormtail\\" in the Lord of the Rings for instance.)  Wormin reports the Earl's traitorous opinions to Prince John and the Sherrif of Nottingham.  By this time they had already begun to suspect Fitzooth of being Robin Hood.  Under Prince John's orders the sheriff shows up at the Earl's wedding to the Lady Marian Fitzwalter, and declares him an outlaw, and his estate is confiscated and turned over to Guy of Gisborne who is one of John's supporters.  On this day Robert Fitzooth reveals that he really is Robin Hood an vows that he will not marry Marian until Richard the true King of England returns and that his title and lands are restored. Robin then flees into the woods of Sherwood with several of his men to hide. Marian soon joins him there and goes by the name of Maid Marian until they are wed.  As outlaws they survive by hunting the king's deer.  Robin's legend then grows as does his followers as he then begins to \\"rob from the rich to give to the poor\\".He and his men take to highway robbery.  They never however harm a women or steal from an honest or poor man.  Most of the men who Robin winds up taking money from turn out to be from the clergy who ironically are the least honest of all.  King Richard hearing of the uprisings back in England, tries to return to put things back in order, but on his way he is taken captive in a foreign land and held for ransom.  Prince John refuses to pay the ransom, since the last thing he wants is for Richard to return, so Robin Hood and his men start to raise the ransom themselves.<br /><br />No matter how stated, the story of Robin Hood is legend.  In his introduction to the book, Green says that the stories are not confined to any actual history, or geography however.  Most, including this novel place the Robin Hood stories at the time of King Richard I, but others have placed it in the time of one of the Edwards, and that one even placed it in the time of King Henry VIII.  Sherwood forest also can not be found on any map.  Robin himself appears to go by many aliases.  He is Robert Fitzooth, known as Robert Earl of Huntingdon, Esquire of Locksly, also known as Robin Hood.  Robin seems to get into a fight with almost everyone he meets.  He tests their mettle with feats of strength or agility, and if they pass his test he asks them to join his band.  Robin is very good at everything, but he is not the best fighter with his fists, a sword, or with a quarter staff, but where he excels all others is with his feats with the long bow.  Robin is the best archer in the land, and he displays this throughout the book in more than one challenge.<br /><br />The other characters are classics as well, and are all well represented.  There is William Scathlock, also know as William Scarlett, who is Robin's second in command.  John Little, also know as Little John, who is very good with the quarter staff.  Brother Michael, also known as Friar Tuck, who is Little John's cousin and is also very good with a quarter staff as well.  Then of course there is the Lady Marian Fitzwalter, also know as Maid Marian, who surprisingly is given very modern feminist qualities.  She's a better archer than most of the men and isn't too bad with the sword either.  In one scene she takes on four of five of Prince John's men herself for a while.  I also learned of a few other characters who's stories I hadn't heard before, but were just as entertaining.  One of these was George-a-Green, the Piner of Wakefield who's feats for a while were almost more well renown even than Robin's himself.  George's lady Bettris was also said to be even more beautiful than the Maid Marian and this made Marian jealous.  In one very good chapter Robin and Marian set out to meet George and Bettris to find out the truth, and eventually they all become very good friends. There is also a story of a young minstrel named Allin-a-Dale who Robin assists in winning back his beloved.  He also helps the noble Knight Sir Richard of Legh who was a big King Richard supporter from having his land taken from him by the church.  To help pay back their debt, several times throughout the story Sir Richard and Allin-a-Dale repay the favor by helping to hide Robin when the Prince or sheriff's men are hunting him.<br /><br />I believe the tale of Robin Hood is an original, but I can see it's influences in other classics such as the obvious \\"Ivanhoe\\", but also in \\"The Curse of Capistrano (which became the Mark of Zorro)\\", \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\", and \\"The Three Musketeers\\".<br /><br />A good book, but I'd be interested in a seeing a modern version that can improve upon the achievements that Green has done with this story by adding a little more life to the retelling.

She is also the daughter of Senator Sexton, who is the leading candidate for the opposition party for the Presidency.  Sexton's main platform for his campaign is that NASA has a monopoly on space and that they greatly overspend their budget every year.  For the amount of money the public puts into this institution Sexton believes they should be getting a greater return.  He believes that maybe some of the private sectors could do better.  Even with these assaults on NASA by Sexton in the press however, current President Zach Herney has continued to be a great supporter of NASA even though it is ruining his chances for reelection.  When Rachel is called to the White House to meet with the President, she doesn't know whether she is being called on for her analytical skills, or if as her boss director William Pickering had warned, that since she wasn't getting along well with her father since her mother's death, that the President might try to use her as a pawn against her father.  When Rachel arrives however, to her surprise, the President seems like a nice guy and only wants her to verify the authenticity of a find NASA has made in the Milne Ice Shelf of the Arctic Circle, a discovery that if true could justify all of NASA's spending and ultimately guarantee Herney a second term in the White House.  She is then whisked away to the Arctic along with a group of independent scientists to verify the finding.  One of the independent scientists is an oceanographer named Michael Tolland who has his own television show like Jacques Cousteau, and he develops into Rachel's love interest over the course of the book.  One of the other scientists, Corky Marlinson a biologist, is used effectively for comic relief.  While Rachel is in the Artic she and the other scientists unravels some disturbing evidence about the find and have to try to escape with there lives while the truth is being covered up.  The biggest question is then trying to figure out who has enough influence to be behind all of these cover-ups.  The suspects then start to build up.  The head of NASA it appears must be in on it, and the President's main advisor, the cigarette smoking Marjorie Tench also appears very guilty, but does the corruption travel all the way to the Presidency itself?<br />In this story Brown seems to play both sides of the fence on the issue of NASA.versus the Private Space Industry.  I believe the truth lies somewhere in between however.  I believe NASA should stop working at a loss, and that some of these private companies should be given some of the contracts.  The monopoly of space (if there really is one) should be ended.  We just need to regulate these things properly to allow for the private sector to safely go into space while maintaining NASA's main goals which should be in science.  Our future lies out there.  How we get there however is still open for debate.<br /><br />This book was only written in 2001, but already some of the information about NASA having a monopoly on space is a little outdated.  Just this past year (2004) I witnessed a new space race in the private sector that caught my interest.  I loved the $10 Million X Prize challenge that was to be given to the first private entrepreneur who can put three people into suborbital space and do it again with the same equipment within two weeks -- and do it by the end of this year (2004).  The X Prize is modeled on the $25,000 Orteig Prize that Charles Lindbergh won for crossing the Atlantic nonstop in 1927.  Practically overnight following this, the narrow public perception of the airplane as a weapon and a stunt device expanded to embrace air travel as something for Everyman.  The X Prize serves to \\"to create a business model,\\" to show that the private sector can fly to space for only a fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars that it costs for a NASA space shuttle mission, or even the estimated $20 million that space tourists Dennis Tito and Mark Shuttlesworth paid to ride on the Russian Soyuz.  At the moment, the leading X Prize contender is Burt Rutan's team (Team Rutan), but there are a half-dozen others close behind, especially the Canada-based Orva Space Corp., who are the developers of the \\"Da Vinci Project\\" (I'm sure the Dan Brown fans will find this ironic).  It features a giant, helium-filled balloon that will release a rocket 80,000 feet above Earth for a burn into suborbital space. Burt Rutan, who gained widespread renown in 1986 when his Voyager became the first aircraft to circumnavigate the globe without refueling, estimates that commercial suborbital flights could cost $30,000 to $50,000 \\"initially,\\" and as little as $7,000 to $12,000 in a \\"second generation.\\"  The \\"prize model\\" has also drawn interest from NASA, which is now trying to use similar competitions to enlist private know-how in overcoming hurdles posed by President Bush's proposal for exploring the moon and Mars. \\"We see prizes as a good way to do that,\\" said Brant Sponberg, program manager for Centennial Challenge, NASA's prize initiative. The agency has asked for a budget of $20 million for it in 2005. Sponberg is contemplating contests including \\"land ten kilos [23 pounds] on the moon very cheaply,\\" and \\"develop a system to land very precisely on the moon or Mars\\" without a satellite navigation system. \\"I'm sure there's some genius kid out there who can probably figure it out.\\" he said.<br />In Washington Senator John McCain who is the Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, has also had several hearings on the commercialization of space, and members of Congress are examining current legislation dealing with the commercialization of space and proposing amendments to it.<br />Another big topic in this book is whether or not life originated on Earth?  The book makes reference to a real NASA discovery in 1996 named ALH84004.  This a rock that appears to be from Mars that was found in the Arctic and has the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  This could be considered evidence of bacteria fossils, and they are much smaller than any found on Earth, and if verified could be considered Proof that there was Life on Mars.  According to the Panspermia Theory (or Cosmic Ancestry), which is the belief that life originated elsewhere (possibly on Mars), bacteria or spores were used to populate the Earth with amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, which then evolved into all the species.  If this finding could be validated it would lend great support to this theory.  Since the rock was in the Artic for 13,000 years the find is currently being dismissed due to the question of contamination.  We won't know for certain if it is proof unless another rock like it is actually found on Mars.  The next NASA trips to Mars are not planned until 2007 to obtain a sample.<br />Brown also touches upon a few other advances in technology in this book that were very interesting.  He mentions Nano Technology, which are tiny robots that can make other robots or perform a programmed function, and Biomimics, that imitate nature.  By studying how to imitate nature, scientists created Velcro, and are currently working to mimic spider webs, solar power, and limb replacement similar to that used by salamanders.  Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) which are Microbots, are also described in this book are some of the up and coming technology that supposedly will be used more prevalently in the real world.<br /><br />By looking up some of the topics in this book I also found some very cool sites.

White that I have read to my daughters (ages 6 & 8), and they have greatly enjoyed all of them (the other two of course were \\"Charlotte's Web\\" and \\"Stuart Little\\").  It is the story of a young trumpeter swan named Louis who is born with a birth defect in that he can't talk.  It seems verbal communication is a great part of a swan's courting ritual, and since Louis can't use his voice to say \\"Ko-Hoh\\", his mother and father believe this will be a great disadvantage for him when he gets older and wants to attract a mate.  At great personal risk and dishonor, Louis' father, the old cob, sets out to help his son by stealing a brass trumpet from a music store so that his son will have a voice.  The old cob is a very funny character.  He is always making all of these long winded speeches, and his wife has to cut him off or he would go on forever. The beginning of the book reads likes a nature lesson, and you learn all about swans raising cygnets (baby swans) in their natural inhabitant, but then in the later chapters it turns into an adventure story as Louis sets out on his own.  To repay his father for his sacrifice, Louis goes to school to learn to read and write so that he can communicate with humans, and then he sets out to pay off his father's debt and to restore his family name.  With the help of a young boy named Sam Beaver who had become friends with this family of swans back in Canada, Louis gets a job as a bugler at a summer camp Sam was working at.  Sam knows a lot about nature and wants to work in a zoo when he grows up.  At camp KooKooskoos Louis makes many friends, and learns to play revelry and taps on his bugle, and earn a little bit of money as well.  At the end of the summer when the camp closes Louis moves to Boston to get a second job working on the swan boats at the Boston Common.  (You are greatly reminded at this point of \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\" which takes place in the same atmosphere.)  The man who owns the swan boats is very nice to Louis and puts him up at the Ritz Hotel for a while.  After Sam returns and helps Louis again by surgically separating one of his webbed feet, the quality of Louis' trumpet playing greatly improves.  Louis then starts to become well known, and is offered a job as a jazz musician in Philadelphia.  He moves out to Philadelphia and stays at the Philadelphia Zoo for a while.  It is the custom of the head man at this zoo however to clip a wing of any bird that comes there that they want to keep.  This prevents them from flying away.  In order for Louis to keep his freedom and not to have his wing clipped he has to agree to play a free concert every Sunday for the people of Philadelphia.  By fate it is here in Philadelphia at the zoo, that he meets his true love Serena and woes her with his trumpet playing.  After earning enough money to pay off his father's debt, they move back to Montana to start a family.  While the book was great there was one minor negative thing I found that prevented it from being quite perfect.  In the story Louis goes to great lengths to explain the value of freedom, but then in the end he volunteers to leave one of his cygnets at the Philadelphia zoo whenever they need a new one.  Since this would remove that cygnet's freedom, it seemed kind of hypocritical.  E.B. White does appears to support zoos in this story, but with the amount of mixed signals he sends it wasn't always whole heartedly.  The illustrations in they book by Fred Marcellino were very good and added immensely to the story.s is very nice to Louis and puts him up at the Ritz Hotel for a while.

Mr. & Mrs. Twit, the main character's are not very nice, and when they perform cruel practical jokes on each other you really don't have much sympathy for either one since you aren't meant to really like them.  Some of the jokes are classics however, such as making the wife's cane a little longer each night, and her chair a little taller each day so that she thinks she is shrinking.  I've seen several television shows do take offs on this joke over the years to try to get someone to believe they were shrinking, or doing it in reverse so that they believe they are getting taller.  The Twit's also own a family of monkeys they obtained while working in the circus, and the father monkey's name is Muggle-Wump.  ((This book was written in 1980 and I'm curious if J.K. Rowlings (the writer of \\"Harry Potter\\") got her name for humans \\"muggles\\" from reading this book.))  Muggle-Wump is a smart monkey, and with the help of his family and of some birds, lead by an African Bird named the Roly-Poly Bird, they get revenge on the Twits for the cruel treatment they have been given, and turn the Twit's world upside down.	2005-01-20

Roald Dahl gives us his own twisted and very entertaining view of several of the classic children's fairy tales, including Cinderella, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Jack and the Bean Stock, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Little Red Riding Hood, and The Three Little Pigs.  The rhymes, although they are a little violent at times, are indeed very funny.  There isn't anything however that most children shouldn't be able to handle without getting scared.  My six and eight year old daughters loved it.  The illustrations by Quentin Blake were also wonderful as usual.  The only downfall is that I wish it was longer.	2004-12-29

One of the best war novels I've ever read.  Now I know why Hemingway is known as one of the greatest writers of all time.  I absolutely loved \\"The Old Man and Sea\\", but when \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" fell a little short, I had my doubts.  This was the one that finally clinched it in my mind that Hemingway deserves all of the accolades he's received over the years.  It's a love story that takes place up in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War which took place in the 1930's.  The main character Robert Jordan, is a young American dynamiter in the International Brigade.  Back in the State's Jordan used to be a college professor.  Jordan's grandfather used to be a great war hero, but since his father was labeled a coward, he has set out to try to redeem the family name.  It becomes his assignment to travel into the mountains of Spain, hook up with a band of guerillas, and to blow a pivotal bridge during an upcoming campaign.  Not being as familiar with the Spanish Civil War as I would like have been before reading this novel it was a little hard at first to try to figure out who was fighting and what side Jordan was on.  I then found out there are the Fascists vs. the Republic and Jordan is on the side of the Republic.  At first I thought that members of the Republic were Communists with the ideals they were preaching and since the Russians were advising them, but then when they said some disparaging things about Communists that made me think otherwise.  The guerilla band he joins up with is led by a man named Pablo who at one time used to be great leader, but recently has lost his nerve.  He no longer is as interested in the cause as he once was, and now would rather tend to his horses instead.  He once led this band on a successful assault on a train and everybody in the band still seems to consider this their crowning achievement.  Pablo is still very smart, but nobody now knows if he can continue to be trusted to lead them.  His female companion Pillar is really the one who has held the band together for the last few months of the war, but she lacks Pablo's cunning.  She says she has a little bit of gypsy in her and at times she tells people's fortunes, not all of them however are good.  She is very feisty and was probably something in her day when she used to date several matadors.  The rest of the band is made up of an old man named Anselmo who Jordan loves very much and is one of the few people he really can rely on.  Then there is a few younger men, a pair of competent brothers, plus a strong and loyal man named Agustin, as well as a gypsy who for the most part everybody considers useless.  Finally there is the young girl named Maria.  She was rescued from the fascists during the raid on the train.  She is the daughter of a former Mayor.  Her hair had all been cut off and she isn't as beautiful as she once was, but Jordan immediately falls in love with her the first time he lays eyes on her.  In war a few days can sometimes seem like a life time and the pair make the most of what time they have together.  Pillar had taken Maria under her wing and had been teaching her how to one day be a good wife.  She approves of Jordan and Maria's union and after the fighting is over she wants him to take Maria away from this place.  As the battle nears there are several scrimmages and some great fights.  El Sordo's last stand is very memorable.  Hemingway's descriptions are magnificent.  At times Hemingway switches back and forth between Spanish and English but it never seems to be a distraction as he always provides a translation.  There are things wrong with the Republic that eventually will lead to their downfall, but at this point in the war Hemingway shows them as just little inconsistencies.  For instance, the Republic doesn't seem to believe in religion, so it is ironic that all of the band still say their little prayers every time they are in the middle of a battle.  The people also want to rule themselves rather than be ruled by the government, but they have no trust in one another.  If you are not from the same town as these people you will always be considered an outsider and an enemy.  There are too many fractions in the Republic.  They have some good ideals, but they are unable to really bring any of them to life.  Jordan figures even if they win they would probably need to get rid of most of the leaders since the majority of the ones remaining are all incompetent or murderers.  Both the Fascist and the Republic come off as being very brutal at times.  I wonder what Hemingway's political views really were.  I believe he probably had some of the same ideals that Jordan displays.  This book will make my list of the top 100 books of all time.ant to rule themselves rather than be ruled by the government, but they have no trust in one another.

Harriet likes to spy on the people in her neighborhood all the time and then writes her observations about them in her journal notebook.  Most of her observations, however true, are generally mean or unflattering.<br /><br />Once the nanny leaves, Harriet and her parents are forced to take on some additional responsibilities.  Harriet has a hard time adjusting to this and starts writing incessantly in her journal.  At one point her parent's have to take her to see a psychiatrist.  He shows Harriet that if she spends all of her time writing everything down in her notebook that she won't really be living life, but rather only observing it.  Once Harriet's notebook is taken away from her for a time, she is then forced to learn to balance her time better between living and observing.  This takes time however as she first goes through a little rebellious phase.<br /><br />Harriet then runs into trouble at school when her notebook falls into the wrong hands and everyone at school reads the mean comments she has been making about them all.  (Rather than taking the notebook back from them however and saying that it didn't below to them, she let's them keep it instead.)  Based on the things she had said, her two best friends Janie and a boy named Sport no longer want to play with her and instead join up with a bunch of other kids in the school in order to form the \\"Spy Catchers Club\\".  The initial main purpose of the club is to get back at Harriet for all of the mean things she has said about them all in her notebook, but it then turns into a social club.  The club works for a while to break a lot of people out of the dull molds they were in, but then most of them revert back to the way they had always behaved.<br /><br />In the end, in order to get her friends back Harriet learns that sometimes you have to tell a little white lie in order not to hurt other people's feelings.  She also discovers that her talent for writing might be better served as a newspaper reporter rather than as a military spy.<br /><br />A women who works in my department and used to be a 5th grade teacher around 30 years ago, told me that her students used to love this book.  My girls who are now ages eight and six however didn't find the book quite as entertaining.  Maybe it would have been better for them to have read it when they were a little older, but I really don't think the content was over their head since they've enjoyed other similar types of books in the past.  One reason for the differences in opinion might be that the book was written in 1964 by Louise Fitzhugh and unfortunately now seems to be dated.  One example that comes to mind is that Harriet's best friend Janie, who wants to become a mad scientist when she grows up is always doing things like threatening to blow up the school, or burning holes in her floor in her room at home with chemicals.  (I just don't think that type of behavior would be considered quite so funny in today's environment.)  The illustrations in this book which I believe were drawn by Louise Fitzhugh herself were also probably not the best I've ever seen.

The computer evermind Ominus still controls half of the known worlds, while the humans (or hrethgir as the computers like to call them) control the other half.  The Cymeks have been reduced in power so much that they are almost irrelevant, and for the most part do not come into play until the end of the book.  The computers and humans have fought to a stand still, and for sixty five years neither one has been able to gain an advantage over the other.  That is until with the help of a deranged human, the computers release a plaque upon all of humanity.  The intent was to weaken the human population so much so that they would be unable to stand up against the machine onslaught that was to follow.  Forty percent of the human population dies from the plaque and millions more die from the repercussions that follow.  Out of this rubble rises a cult lead by one of the Butler's (or Harkonnen's) nieces, Rayna Butler.  The cult at first goes about destroying all computers with gel circuitry (meaning the ones that can think for themselves), but then when they become more fanatical they turn their vengeance on destroying all computers in general, even the ones that are being used for good.  Even if humanity is able to recover in time to stop the onslaught from the computers, they may still find themselves set back to the dark ages, as all knowledge that was being stored on the computers is lost.<br /><br />In order to avert this set back, Humanity, in many different forms tries to raise itself to a new level of being.<br /><br />On Rosak the sorceresses there had started a genealogy project to help keep track of the best samples of all of humanity in case entire races were wiped out by the plaque.  In all of the previous Dune books that I had ever read I had always found the Bene Gesserits to be selfish in my opinion.  I always thought that all of their gene manipulation was an attempt to try to create the perfect human, or champion for themselves so that they could rule the world.  In this book however, for the first time you are shown their intentions in a more noble light in that they are trying to reach a new level of humanity in order to help keep it from becoming extinct.<br /><br />On Ginaz the swordmasters there continue to perfect their training so that their minds and bodies can react faster than a computers.<br /><br />Mohandas Suk becomes a famous doctor by setting up a universal hospital to try to find a cure for the plague, and with the help of Vorian Atreides' daughter Raquella Berto-Anirul, they draw upon the knowledge of all the world doctors to make great strides in medicine.<br /><br />The evil robot Erasmus is still around, and he teaches his human prot&eacute;g&eacute; (or son) Gilbertus how to organize his thoughts and mind in such a way that he can reach a level comparable with that of a computer.  Erasmus begins to call him his mentat.<br /><br />It is at this time that it is discovered that the only ones who do not seem to be effected by the plague are those who have been eating melage on a regular basis.  The demand for spice becomes astronomical.  Since spice can only be found on Arakis, it is at this point that this planet starts to take on great importance in the world.<br /><br />People began consuming spice in larger quantities than they had ever eaten previously.  For some special individuals it begins to change them.<br /><br />By consuming large quantities of spice gas the navigator is born.  This is a creature that was once human, but now has the ability to look into the future to safely guide a ship through space.<br /><br />On Rosak the sorceresses are especially affected as a second plague is released upon them worse then the first.  With a combination of increased spice intake mixed with the unique minerals that are only found in the jungles of Rosak, the first mother superior is developed in what turns out to be a new line of Bene Gesserits.  Besides being able to use their bodies as a weapon, they have now developed the ability to control their internal body chemistry as well.  The first signs of using \\"voice\\" are also noted.  The mother superior can also see into the future as well as into the past, and draw upon knowledge from her female ancestors.<br /><br />While the humans are trying to reach this higher level of being, some of the computers seem to take on more human qualities.  Chirox, the computer fighting mek who has been training human swordmasters for years proves to be more noble than the majority of humans who are part of the cult.  The Robot Erasmus who had spent years torturing humans now takes on a new respect for them after he develops a sense of love for his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and starts to think of him as his son.

There he is rescued from a pile of dirt in Time Square's Subway station by a little boy named Mario, and he takes Chester in.  Mario and his mother and father, Mr. & Mrs. Bellini, own a news stand at the station and that becomes Chester's new home.  While he is staying at the stand Chester meets a mouse named Tucker who lives next to it in a drain pipe, and a cat named Harry, and they all become great friends.  Tucker and Harry tell Chester all about New York, and make him feel welcome.  Mario has never seen a cricket in New York before, and he really isn't sure how he is supposed to care for one, so he looks for some advice.  He remembers seeing some cricket cages in Chinatown, so he goes there with Chester to find some information about crickets.  There he meets a wise old Chinaman named Mr. Fong.  He informs Mario that the Chinese believe crickets are good luck and tells him a story about the first cricket.  The story Mr. Fong tells is about a man who knew all things, and spoke only truth, but his enemies wanted to kill him for speaking the truth.  The gods loved him so much however that they wanted to protect him, so they turned him into a cricket.  They say that now even though people can not understand the cricket song, it still fills them up with love because it still speaks of wisdom and truth.  After that Mr. Fong and Mario become close friends.  He sells Mario a cage, gives him a present of a bell for his cricket, and tells him he can come back anytime to take leaves from his tree to feed the cricket.  Mario returns home and they are all happy for a while, but rather than bringing the Bellini's any good luck, Chester seems to bring only bad instead.  Several accident's ensue, caused by Chester, Tucker, and Harry Cat.  It looked like Mama Bellini was going to want to get rid of Chester, until they discover that he is a musical genius who can play any song perfectly.  People then come from all over New York to see Chester play.  This makes Chester very famous, but not very happy.  As the season changes Chester has a dilemma on his hands as he becomes very homesick and wants to return to Connecticut, but he doesn't want to leave Mario, and his other new friends.  My girls who are six and seven loved this book.

We picked it up and I read it to both her and her younger sister who is six.  It was a nice story, and my oldest daughter liked it better than the movie (which she said was very different), but it just didn't seem to capture their attention for extended periods of time.  Unlike other children's novels we've read together where they would generally be begging me to continue reading into the next chapter to see what's going to happen, several times they just kept asking when each chapter was going to end because they were bored.<br /><br />I think they were turned off a bit by some of the old English, and the broad Yorkshire slang that is used extensively throughout several parts of the book.  They had a hard time following the story line at those times.<br /><br />The story itself is about a spoiled ten year old English girl with a bad disposition named Mary, who lived over in India.  When her parents suddenly die she is sent back to England to go live with her Uncle at Misselthwaite Manor.  Here she meets a nice Yorkshire servant girl named Martha who won't be bossed around, and she informs Mary of how spoiled she has become.  Everyone thinks Mary looks ugly and sickly as well because she never gets any fresh air or does any exercise.  Martha suggests to Mary that if she wants to improve her health and her disposition that she might try going out on the moor and get some fresh air and to do some exercise. She does this and her outlook on life begins to change for the better.<br /><br />In one of their conversations, Mary finds out from Martha that ten years previously, Mr. Craven's wife (her aunt) had died during childbirth, and that her uncle Mr. Craven had been devastated by it.  He couldn't bear to be around anything that would remind him of his loss so he spends most of his time away from the one hundred room manor traveling the world instead.  Mrs. Craven had loved to spend all of her time in a walled off rose garden, but since the sight of the garden brought him such great sorrow, Mr. Craven had ordered that it be locked up and that the key buried.  For ten years it had sat there being overgrown, and now nobody knew how to get into it since the gate was no longer visible.<br /><br />Mary thought it would be wonderful to try to find this secret garden and sets out looking for it.  With the help of a robin she finds the key and gains access to it.  She then tries to restore it to it's former beauty.  She doesn't know much about gardening however so she enlists the help of Martha's brother Dickon who seems to know everything about plants and animals and is a kind of animal charmer.  Working in the garden makes Mary healthier and happier then she's ever been in her life.  Then she uncovers another mystery.<br /><br />During the night she hears screaming coming from another part of the manor and goes to investigate.  There she finds a very sickly looking boy named Colin who none of the servants are allowed to talk about.  Everybody believes the boy is going to die soon so they humor him by giving him anything he wants.  This has made the boy quite spoiled.<br /><br />Mary believes the boy is acting a lot like the way she used to when she first came to the manor.  She believes that if she can get him to agree to go into the garden, maybe the magic there will help him get better as well, and maybe he won't die.  She then puts this plan into action.<br /><br />They all believe the garden has special magical powers since it made Mary better, but it's also common sense that as long as you don't have some deadly disease, that if you eat right, get plenty of fresh air, exercise, and reduce your stress level that it should make you healthier.  With the help of Dickon, Mary tries to instill a positive attitude in the boy, and convince him to at least give the garden a try.<br /><br />If you love gardening, rather then like it, then maybe you would appreciate the rest of this book a little more than my daughters and I did.  There are long descriptions of each type of flower that grows in the secret garden and how to tend to each one of them.  Like the adage that watching the grass grow is considered to be boring, well, the descriptions that follow throughout the remainder of this book of people watching flowers grow aren't that much more exciting either.e garden a try. <br /> <br />If you love gardening, rather then like it, then maybe you would appreciate the rest of this book a little more than my daughters and I did.

Everything good is represented by the Neanderthals and everything bad is represented by the Gliskens.  Then Sawyer goes onto specifically say that the Gliskens represent the U.S. and the Neanderthals represent the Canadians, as if it wasn't already implied enough.<br /><br />Everything is \\"Canada this\\" and \\"Canada that\\".  Whenever there is a song on the radio or a c.d. playing in the car it has to be one of their favorite Canadian singers.  Whenever someone has read a good book, it has to be by one of their favorite Canadian authors.  I can't remember ever wondering if my favorite singers or authors were American or not.  It isn't that important to me, but apparently it is to Sawyer who's whole book is Canadian fanfare.<br /><br />I think it was a Twilight Zone episode in which aliens came to our world and were about to offer us a cure for all diseases, but we killed them off out of fear by accident before they could give us the information.  The aliens that then came afterwards said that we were just not ready yet, and perhaps they would try again in several years.  It was a great storyline.  In this book however Sawyer makes it out like the U.S. is so evil and greedy that even if the Neanderthals did cure all of our diseases and provided us with the greatest advances we've seen in science history, that we would be so ungrateful that we would still want to kill them all off just to take their land.  Wow!  Why does he hate America so much?  I'd say there is some real jealousy here that I could understand, but there is also some real loathing as well.<br /><br />Finally in this third installment we find out that not all of the Neanderthals are perfect.  It was a nice change.  (Hey, everybody would even hate Superman if he didn't have a few flaws.)  Neanderthals actually suffer some of our own domestic issues and problems.  In this book the main character Mary goes to live in the Neanderthal world for a period of time.  She is still in love with the main Neanderthal character Ponter, and together they try to find some new technology that will allow them to have a child, even though they are from different species.  While Mary is in the Neanderthal world however, she winds up adopting several of their ways.  I'm sorry, but I had a problem with this.  Okay, I was willing to buy the fact that Mary and Ponter found each other so attracted to each other (even though they are from a completely separate world, and a completely different species), that they fell in love, but then they go and have Mary turn bisexual as well.  (I've heard about girls being curious in college, but most of the time they say it is just practicing until they're with a boy.  This however is a lot different.)  I'm sorry, but I believe people are either gay, or they are not.  They don't turn gay, just as gay people don't turn straight.<br /><br />A few other things that bothered me in this book was that Sawyer appears to be in favor of castration for sexual crimes.  He sets it up so that one of the characters in the book who is castrated is supposedly happier now after the castration then he was before it.  I'm sorry but I think that would just make him even angrier, regardless of the fact that he would no longer have any testosterone in his body.<br /><br />You're probably wondering why I even bothered finishing this series if I hated it so much.  The reason is that every once in a while Sawyer brings up a nice science fiction theory that is worth contemplating.  In this book he throws out the idea that the belief in God or religion might just be an abnormality in the parental lobe in the left hemisphere of the brain.  It was fun to think about.  The stuff about designing all of the attributes you would like your child to have was very good as well.  If Sawyer only could get off his political soapbox and stick more to the science, then I'd have enjoyed this book a lot better.<br /><br />As a bit of trivia, in the book they mention that one of the main American character studied game theory under John Nash at Princeton.  He is the man that the movie \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" was based on.mention that one of the main American character studied game theory under John Nash at Princeton.

A boy used to accompany him in his boat to assist him, but after the fortieth day without catching a fish, the boy's parents declared that the old man was unlucky, and made the boy go out in a different boat that wound up catching three fish the first week.  The boy still loved the old man however and even after he no longer accompanied him on his boat, he still tried to look after him and lend him some assistance on the shore.<br /><br />One day in order to try to change his luck the old man sails out by himself beyond his normal limits to the deep sea in search of a big fish.  Out beyond all the other boats and the view of the land he gets into a great battle with an 18 foot Marlin and several sharks.  Several times the man has to gather his remaining strength to match his wits and will against that of the great fish.  The battle becomes a kind of religious experience and in it the old man gains great respect for the fish and for life itself.  He shows great courage in the face of defeat, and with it gains a personal triumph from his loss.<br /><br />The story is based on a true story Hemingway was told by one of his fisherman friends named Carlos when he lived in Cuba.  They were having a discussion of the thrill of deep sea fishing and big game hunting.  It took several years however before he actually got time to write it down and turn it into a short story.  When he finally got back around to it he had to go back out deep sea fishing with his friend again several times to get the feel down just right, but I believe he captures the experience perfectly.<br /><br />This book was written in 1952 which was baseball's glory days, and you certainly can see it's influence in this story.  Joe DiMaggio who's father was a fisherman is reverently mentioned on more than one occasion.  (I wonder whether it's favorable depiction in this book has helped Baseball maintain it's tremendous popularity as a sport in Cuba to this day.)<br /><br />I first read this story over twenty years ago when I was in High School and loved it.  When I was recently reviewing my list of books deemed to be among the best ever written, one of my daughters asked me to read it to her.  It wasn't really a children's story, and was a little difficult at times to read out loud (since the main character Santiago speaks in broken English), but she appeared to love it just as much as I did.

That being said, this book however was not at all wonderful, and unfortunately it is the first Dahl book that I wouldn't recommend.<br />While Roald Dahl generally champions such issues as child neglect, corporal punishment, and preaches against the dangers of too much television, or relying to heavily on calculators (all worthy issues), here instead for some reason or other, he comes out in support of larceny and cheating.<br />\\"Danny the Champion of the World\\" is about a poor boy who lives with his father in an old caravan behind the gas station they own.  The father is a widower and the father and son love each other very much.  They don't have much money, but they don't have any wants either.  They seem to live a very peaceful and happy life.  Danny's father seems to be a wonderful guy who teaches Danny the trade of being a mechanic in hopes that one day he might be a great inventor.  His father is also a great story teller, and one of the bed time stories he tells Danny is about the BFG (The Big Friendly Giant).  (I can only assume Dahl used this initial premise to go on to write the full story in his BFG novel that was very good.)<br />At this early stage in the story I thought it was a great book, but then things go wrong.  You come to find out that Danny's lovable father has been keeping a secret from Danny.  After he gets injured he finally has to tell Danny that he used to love to go up to Mr. Hazel's wood who is the richest man in town, and steal his pheasants, and that he has started to do it again.  Not only does he tell Danny that he used to do it, but that he tells him that his mother, his grandfather, and some other very good people who Danny has respected all his life in the town used to steal pheasants as well.<br />Right here is where Dahl loses me.  I've come to understand through his other writings that Roald Dahl was a big fan of Charles Dickens and probably liked Dicken's character of the Artful Dodger very much, but his attempt to create a similar character in \\"Danny the Champion of the World\\" here fails miserably.  The problem was that he goes on to say that it wasn't because they were poor and needed the food that they were going up there and stealing pheasants, (if that was the case I still would consider it wrong, but at least I could understand someone being driven to the point of having to do that, like the Artful Dodger), but rather that they were going up there for the thrill of it, as if they had a gambling problem and needed the high of the game.<br />Rather than preaching that poaching is dangerous and wrong, and that Danny should stay away from it, he corrupts Danny into doing it as well.  Danny could be considered the champion of the world if he can just figure out a way of stealing more pheasants than anyone else has ever done before.  (I'm sorry but that isn't exactly the goal I would set for my world champion.)<br />You are informed that Mr. Hazel is a very bad man, even though he never did anything illegal to obtain his money, he just isn't very nice.  Danny's father makes it out like that since Mr. Hazel isn't very nice then it is all right to steal from him.  Isn't that a nice message for the kids.<br />Mr. Hazel isn't a nice man and you do dislike him, but Danny's father even though he is nice, doesn't prove to be any better of a man.<br />There is one scene late in the book where they have this well dressed women hide the stolen pheasants in a baby carriage under her child to smuggle them to each person's house.  The child is terrified and almost gets injured by the pheasants as they try to escape.  All I kept thinking was that unfortunately some drug dealers may have learned this method of smuggling from reading this book.  (I find it inconceivably wrongto use a child in any illegal activity.).<br />I'd like to forget that Dahl ever wrote this book and focus more on his other great works that certainly are worth much more attention.  I spent most of this book explaining what was wrong with the story to my girls and kept hoping that in the end there would be some redeeming message, but it never comes.to use a child in any illegal activity.).<br />I'd like to forget that Dahl ever wrote this book and focus more on his other great works that certainly are worth much more attention.

Along the way they have to overcome many obstacles.  Fogg spends most of his fortune overcoming these obstacles and if they don't win the bet he will be ruined.  There are some things however that even money can't overcome and several times Fogg is faced with a moral decision that if he pursues the right thing to do will significantly set him back on time.<br />Their travels take them through England, Paris, the Suez Canal, Egypt, India, Hong Kong, Japan, America, and Ireland.  In India they rescue a princess who stays on with them throughout the rest of their journey and a love interest grows between her and Fogg.  There is also another subplot involving a bank robbery in England where 55 thousand pounds have been stolen, and Fogg is considered to be the main suspect.  A detective Fix is assigned to follow Fogg and to arrest him once he sets foot on English territory.<br />This book seems to be split into two parts.  During the first part of the book when things are going smoothly the servant Passepartout seems to be the main character.  At each port Fogg stays in his cabin and just focuses on the next leg of the trip while Passepartout ventures out and gives you a description of the land.  It would seem a shame to travel all around the world and not pause to take in any of the sights as Fogg does.  I found most of these early chapters pretty mundane and uneventful.<br />The subplot with Fix at times becomes annoying, and it isn't until they are all working towards the same goal, that this line of the story improves.  I also found the exchange rate between dollars and pounds confusing at times.  The pound must have been about four or five times greater than the dollar at the time this story was written.  Fogg leaves England with around twenty thousand pounds and spends it seems over a hundred thousand dollars on the trip.<br />Later on as the story progresses and things start to go wrong the focus changes over to Fogg.  Passepartout still does some heroic things, but Fogg takes charge and shows some redeeming qualities.  The pace of the story quickens and becomes more enjoyable with a few skirmishes taking place in India and America.  Fogg seems a different person upon returning to England, and his life is changed forever.<br />My wife has a framed poster that hangs on one of our walls with a collage of all of the movies that have won the best picture of the year award.  \\"Around The World In Eighty Days\\" won the award in 1956, and the picture is represented in the collage with the main character Phileas Fogg and his trusty servant Passepartout taking a balloon flight.

I was surprised then to find out once I finally got a chance to read the actual book that they travel by boat, train, car, sled, and even elephant, but that they never travel by balloon.  It turns out that the most memorable scene from the movie was made up by the director and added on to the story.  The director seemed to have come to same conclusion that I did, that the written story itself was very good, but I was expecting something a little more.<br />The book was written in 1873.

I kept expecting the talking animals to rise up behind the pig and take over the farm.  Rest assured however there was none of that, as E.B. White does a good job of keeping the story at a purely kids level.<br />Wilber is the runt in a litter of pigs, and Mr. Arable the farmer is going to take him out back and have him slaughtered since as he says, \\"He is small and weak and will never amount to anything.\\"  His young daughter Fern who is eight, hears this and requests that her father give the pig to her to raise instead.  The father wishing to prove a point to her, allows this so long as she promises to do all the work to take care of it.  To Mr. Arable's surprise Fern does an excellent job of raising Wilber and he turns out to be \\"Some Pig\\", proving that even though he was very small he still could amount to something.<br />As Wilber grows bigger the Arable's can no longer support feeding him, so Mr. Arable has Fern sell Wilber to her uncle Mr. Zuckerman who has a farm down the road.  There she goes and visits Wilber every day.  Being young I guess gives you the ability to sit and listen to the animals more intently than adults, and by doing so Fern is able to hear that the animals can actually talk and she understands them.  (Being the father of two girls who are 7 and 5, I'd have to disagree somewhat with this logic as my girls never sit still, and certainly have a hard time listening at times, but for the sake of the story we'll just give them the benefit of the doubt.)<br />Anywise Wilber meets all the other animals in the barn who are very nice, but none of them are really his close friend.  He becomes lonely and wishes for a friend.  A gray spider named Charlotte answers his prayers and after introducing herself, she becomes Wilber's best friend.<br />When the other animals tell Wilber that Mr. Zuckerman is just fatting him up to eat him for Christmas, this makes him greatly disturbed.  Charlotte being a great friend promises to do all she can to make Wilber so important to Mr. Zuckerman that he would change his mind.  She sets a plan in action to weave messages into her web proclaiming how great the pig is, and by doing so she hopes to trick the adults into believing it as well.  With the help of Templeton the rat she obtains some newspaper clippings and begins her work.<br />Each new message in the web is looked upon as miracle, but rather than looking for any religious connection, the folks in the town just believe they have a very famous pig on their hands and accept it at face value.<br />The suspense builds as Zuckerman takes Wilber to the Fair.  If he can just win an award there, Charlotte knows his life will be saved.  Charlotte and Templeton have to stow away in Wilber's crate just to accompany him to the Fair, and then when they get there the pig in the stall next to Wilber is twice as big and looks to be a shoe in for first prize.<br />This book was obviously written at a much simpler time in history.  At the Fair grounds the adults send the kids off on their own.  Besides Fern who is 8, she has a little brother Avery who is only 5.  After giving them all kinds of warnings such as not to eat too much, and to stay out of the sun, to not get dirty, and to be careful on the rides, the mother stops and says to the husband, \\"Do you think they'll be all right?\\" and he responds, \\"Well they have to grow up sometime.\\"  (None of the warnings were about staying away from strangers.)  Of course when the kids returned they hadn't stayed out of the sun and were hot, and completely dirty, but they had fun.<br />Fern meets a boy at the Fair, and starts to grow up a bit as playing with him starts to seem like more fun than talking to bunch of animals.<br />It is a great book about overcoming obstacles even though you are very small, growing up, and most of all friendship.  My girls loved the book as well, and especially seemed to like the illustrations by Garth Williams.l, growing up, and most of all friendship.

She is neglected by her parents, but still manages on her own to advance her education beyond her years by reading books.  To punish her parents, for their lack of interest in her and for their mishandling of her upbringing, she decides to play some practical jokes on them (or especially on her father who is a crooked car salesman).  As a parent of two girls who are 5 and 7 I was a little apprehensive about appearing to give approval to some of the things Matilda does, so I had to remind my girls that this was just a story, and they seemed to understood (or at least I hope they did.)  As the story progresses Matilda goes to school for the first time, and has to do battle with the evil headmistress Miss Trunchbull, who is an ex-Olympic hammer thrower.  She has been terrorizing the school for years by physically abusing all of the children who do not measure up to her standards.  She especially hates the younger children.  If they do anything wrong, she twirls them around by their hair as if they were a hammer and throws them out windows and across the schoolyard to help her stay in shape.  The kids would go home and complain to their parents, but the stories about the headmistress would be so outrageous that none of the parents believed they could be true.  The kids were left to deal with the headmistress on their own.<br />Matilda's first grade teacher Miss Honey is extremely nice.  She is the first person to recognize Matilda's brilliance and wants to help Matilda reach her full potential, but Ms. Honey has problems of her own, and isn't strong enough to face the Trunchbull either.  Since Matilda is being held back and is not allowed to use her brain to the fullest of it's potential, a force builds up inside of her.  This gives Matilda some special Telekinetic abilities which she uses to come up with a plan to defeat the Trunchbull and improve her and Miss Honey's future.  Roald Dahl tells another great tale that captures the kid's imagination and held them greatly entertained.  Quentin Blake's illustrations once again add greatly to the story.  Dahl touches upon some of his usual quirks that he hates, such television, T.V. dinners, and calculators.  He also seems to be against advertisement's that sell something for $9.99 instead of $10.00.  It was interesting to note that he does also mention several other children's writers in this story, and seems to give his own opinion on each.  For instance he has Matilda comment that C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien are great writers, but he believes their writings are too serious.  He believes children love to laugh, and that is why children's stories should have so much more humor in them.  He also seems to be a big fan of Charles Dickens.  My girls are now looking forward to seeing the movie that was just released a few years ago based on this book.ures the kid's imagination and held them greatly entertained.

Before bedtime each night his grandmother would tell him stories, and his favorite story was always about the Witches.  His grandmother seemed to know everything about them and told him how to recognize and stay away from them.  The boy never knew his grandmother to lie, so he listened and followed her advice on the subject.  When the boy finds out that Witches really do exist, his grandmother's advice comes in handy to help the little boy escape them for a long period time, but they eventually catch up to him half way through the book and turn him into a mouse.  You would think that this would be a very sad thing, but the boy loves being a mouse.  Actually while reading this book to my five and seven year old daughters, the youngest one said that she thought being a mouse would be a very neat thing and asked if it was possible for me to turn her into one.  I told her that even if I could I wouldn't since I would miss having my little girl too much.  As a mouse the boy realizes he can do a lot of things he couldn't have done otherwise if he was still a little boy, so with the help of his grandmother they comes up with a plan to get rid of all the witches in England.  It was a great story.  Unlike Roald Dahl's other books which touch upon scary subject's but in a humorous way, this one without a doubt is trying to scare your kids.  Rather then giving my girls nightmares however, it was more along the lines of them listening to a good ghost story around the fire while you are away at camp, and they just found it very entertaining.  Quintin Blake once again drew some wonderful illustrations to capture the action which added to the story.	2004-05-13

Sawyer adds a new twist to the idea of having someone come from a different Universe to get a new perspective on ours.  Rather than going the usual rout of having an alien come from another planet to visit our world though, he has someone come from the same world (or parallel world), and show us how things could have been done differently.<br />The main character Ponter Bonditt, is a Neanderthal physicist, who during a quantum computing experiment accidentally opens a portal into our Universe and he falls through it.  Luckily for him in our world at the same spot that he comes through, a group of our scientists had been conducting an experiment, and they are there to help him.  (Otherwise he probably would have drowned, or appeared in the middle of a rock bed a mile under the ground.)<br />In the alternate Universe that Ponter came from, Homo Sapiens are extinct and Neanderthal's are the dominant species.  Their society is like ours in many ways, but with some very big differences.  Women live separately from men.  Neanderthals appear to be bisexual (they have a male and a female mate).  They have a tremendous sense of smell.  For birth control they follow the rhythm method and they can tell by smell whether a women is having her period or ovulating.  Their population is a lot smaller than ours as they deliberately only procreate every ten years to create a new generation.  Their legal system is also quite different.  Everybody carries around a portable computer implanted into their arms which besides monitoring vitals, also serves as an alibi.  Since everybody could be continually watched, there are no crimes. They also do not believe in God.  There is no religion.<br />Considering the facts that Sawyer provides us with that Neanderthal's brains were 10% bigger than Homo Sapiens and their muscle mass was also bigger, it's a mystery how it was that we were the ones that survived, and not the Neanderthals in our Universe.  After further comparisons with the Neanderthals in the other Universe you are made to feel that we behaved far more primitively, and maybe humanity may have been better served if it was the Neanderthals that had won out in our world.  Even though this all happened years before anyone who is alive today you are still made to feel morally responsible.  In their universe they don't have overpopulating.  No starvation.  They never hunted any species to extinction as we did.  They didn't commit genocide as it is theorized in our Universe why the Neanderthals are no longer around.  They don't have wars.  They don't have crime.  They don't use light outside at night so you can still see the stars.  They also had fewer diseases since they didn't eat domesticated animals.  (It appears that the most serious diseases that affected us started out in domesticated animals and then were transferred to people.  Measles, small pox, tuberculosis, the flue, whooping cough, etc...)  After several chapters of this I became very jealous of the Neanderthal's and wanted someone to defend our species, but the greatest accomplishment it seems they could come up with on our side was that we had been to the moon and they hadn't, but even that is downplayed in the book since we've only sent 12 men there and we don't currently populate it.<br />Sawyer does a great job of creating this alternate paradise, and you're just glad to find out everything over there on their side isn't always exactly perfect either.  Luckily they still do seem to have a few flaws.<br />Ponter falling through the portal into our world created a murder mystery on their side, and Ponter's partner Adikor Huld who was with him when it happened is accused.  The story switches back and forth between these two Universes.  Adikor with the help of one of Ponter's children Jasmel, his women-mate Lurt, and another engineer are trying to prove his innocence by recreating the experiment in one universe, and two female scientists (Mary and Louise pronounced Mar and Lou because Neanderthal's can't make the \\"e\\" sound) and one male doctor (Reuben) in our Universe are trying to help Ponter adjust to his new surroundings to face the possibility that he may never get home.  Across the barriers friendships are made and potential romances are begun.<br />The only negative I had in reading this book was that it appears that Sawyer discredits a lot of real life hypothesis regarding the Neanderthals if they don't fit into the mold of the fantasy story he has just laid out in this book.  If the facts don't support the story then he dismisses or discredits them.  One that might cause some controversy is that the Neanderthals don't believe in the Big Bang theory of creation.  He implies that this was made up in our Universe by a group of scientists who's opinions and theories were  influenced by their religious beliefs.  Many of these real theories might be completely off base, but unless a Neanderthal does walk through that door to confirm the facts I believe they shouldn't have been dismissed quite so easily.  At least Sawyer has shined a new light on some of these hypothesizes.<br />This is supposedly book one of a trilogy, and I'm very much looking forward the next installment.and Lou because Neanderthal's can't make the \\"e\\" sound) and one male doctor (Reuben) in our Universe are trying to help Ponter adjust to his new surroundings to face the possibility that he may never get home.

We sat down on the couch late this past Saturday afternoon and I began to read it to them.  After the first chapter I asked them if they wanted me to stop, and instead they begged for more.  I read another, and another, and another, and finally after the eighth chapter in a row I told them I had stop since it was time for them to go to bed.  They were very disappointed, and they made me promise I would read more of it for them the next day.  Believing it was just a ploy so that they could stay up later I didn't take it very seriously, but sure enough right the next morning they were up and had me start reading it to them right away.  They didn't even want to watch any early morning cartoons, or play on their Playstation II.  Before you knew it we had gotten through the first hundred pages in no time at all.  I've never seen them love a book so much.  The illustrations by Quentin Blake throughout the book, and especially right at the beginning, were wonderful.  They grabbed my kids imaginations and kept them long enough to get into the words.  Then once the story line kicked in they were hooked.<br />We loved all of the characters.  There's the eccentric candy making genius Willy Wonka who has locked himself away in his chocolate factory so that the other candy makers can no longer steal his inventions.  The gates are always locked, and nobody goes in and nobody comes out.  Mr. Wonka holds a contest, which seems to just be a promotion to generate sales, but Mr. Wonka also has an ulterior motive in mind.  Five golden ticket are hidden beneath the wrappers of different Wonka Candy bars, and the five lucky children that find these tickets will be given a life time supply of chocolate, as well as given a tour of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory along with their parents.  The five lucky children consist of the glutton Augustus Gloop, the little rich girl Veruca Salt who always gets what she wants since her parent's have spoiled her rotten, the gum chewing Violet Beaugarde, Mike Teavee who only wants to sit around all day watching television, and the last golden ticket of all is found by little Charlie Bucket.  Charlie Bucket is a poor noble good natured child who lives with his two parents and four grandparents in a dilapidated shack.  They all turn out to be dreamers who would rather spend their last dollar trying to win this contest even though they are starving, and should be spending their money more wisely on more nourishing food other than chocolate.  But they all love Charlie very much.  Grampa Joe is Charlie's favorite and he gets to go with Charlie to the factory.  He is 96 years old, but always becomes very energetic when he's with Charlie.<br />Nobody has ever seen Mr. Wonka's new employees who are called the Oompa-Loompas, so they are a big mystery.  They are a tribe of little men no bigger than your knee who love to sing and dance, and live off of cocoa beans.  After each bad child, and bad parent is removed, they like to sing a lovely moralistic little rhyme about what was wrong with the child and how it can still be corrected.<br />This book was written in 1964, and I see that since then many other candy makers have continued to borrow Mr. Wonka's ideas about candies and promotions.  The moralistic themes are also just as poignant now as they were then also.  One moral that still held relevance was that kids should still be taught to read rather spending all of their time watching television.  As you can see from above this can be made easier if there are other such lovely stories as this one to read to entertain them.

The land was older and wiser than the people who walked on it.  According to this book, America didn't have inhabitants to begin with.  They all traveled here from somewhere else, and when they came here they brought with them their own gods in their minds.  Each god that was brought to America was smaller than their counterpart left back in the homeland they came from.  The people who brought them here then became acclimated into the new land and for the most part either stopped believing and worshiping these lesser gods, or they didn't pass their beliefs down to their decedents, so they in turn didn't believe.  This made the gods weak.  Then if it got to the point that no one believed in these gods anymore then they became forgotten and died.<br />In America, all of these lesser gods for the most part look like regular people or animals.  They are con artists, drug addicts, prostitutes, cap drivers, and undertakers.  Most of them are old.  Occasionally Shadow the main character gets to see what they really look like and interacts with them.<br />Shadow is an ex-con who is hired to work as a kind of bodyguard for one of the gods named Wednesday.  Mr. Wednesday is also known by many other names.  A war is brewing between the old gods and the new gods since they believe there isn't enough worship to go around to keep them all going.  It then becomes a mystery as to why Shadow has become such an important part in the whole scheme of things leading up to the war.<br />Shadow travels with Wednesday though America to try to recruit other gods to fight for their side in the upcoming war.  At times Shadow becomes a kind of Jesus like figure (but not Jesus), and there are many comparisons you could make between them in this book.  For the most part Neil Gaiman seems to stay away from religions such as Catholicism and Judaism, and just focuses on the gods themselves.  Many of these lesser gods I had never heard of before, and it gave me an excuse to go out on the web and read their stories and learn about some interesting beliefs and legends.  I wish I had known a little more about the Norse gods before reading this book.  Some of the gods I learned a lot about were Odin, Loki, and Baldor.  The other main characters in the book, Czernobog, Mr. Nancy, Mr. Jackal, Mr. Iblis, Whisky Jack, and Easter were also very entertaining.  I also liked the character of Shadow's wife Laura a lot as well.<br />At times this book reminded me of the book &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; when Shadow and Wednesday start taking road trips to small parts of America to meet up with these different gods.  In &quot;Zen...&quot; the main character is on a trip through the heartland of America as well, and also keeps having dreams, in which he is soul searching to try to find himself.<br />One of the towns they stay in is Lakeside which is a very nice town right out of the Twilight Zone with a mystery of it's own, and a nice side theme.<br />I was also reminded a bit of the movie &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, but instead of seeing ghosts everywhere, Shadow sees gods.<br />The only detraction I can think of in this book was that some of the individual stories of how each god came to America was a little bit of a distraction, but Gaiman ties them all back in later in the book as having some necessary relevance to the story.<br /><br />In the end you are waiting for everything to become perfectly clear and for them to spell it all out for you, but Gaiman doesn't do that.  You have to do that for yourself, and a lot of it might still be left to interpretation.<br />It was a very good book none the less.

At this level you should just be reviewing the basics, but since I was never actually formally taught what the basics are, I didn't want to miss anything.  I also didn't want to teach them something that might have the potential of hurting them by accident.  After reading this book however I feel much better.  It covered a lot of the things I might have overlooked, and gave me the confidence I'll need to get in front of these kids and parents and not embarrass myself.<br />The book was straightforward and easy to read (I got through it in about two days which was good for me.)

I feel as if I've just completed a thrilling college course, and wouldn't be at all surprised if the study of this book wasn't eventually offered as one.  It covers a little bit of everything from history, math, logic, science, religion, astronomy, art, and architecture.  Back when I was in High School, I had heard about the universal code of Nature (1.618 PHI.) in a science class , but it was never presented in such a way before that made it interesting enough for me to really sit down and think about it.  After reading this book I was doing little experiments to verify that it was true.  Oh, by the way in addition to being a very good college text, this book was also a very good murder mystery involving a treasure hunt in search of the Holy Grail.  The questions remain however, \\"What is the Holy Grail or San Greal?\\"  \\"Is it a chalice, a women, a royal blood line, or a bunch of hidden documents?\\"<br />The book quotes the following from Leonardo Da Vinci that it says is in reference to the Bible, \\"Blinding ignorance does mislead us.  O! Wretched mortals, open your eyes!\\"  The line refers to people blindly reading the Bible without questioning the truth in the message.  I would like to caution people not to make the same mistake here by blindly reading this book and accepting everything said here without looking things up for themselves to see how much of it is based on facts, and how much on innuendo.  Some of course is just based on innuendo for the story line, but I was amazed by how much is actually based on real facts (especially the art work, and symbols).  Leonardo obviously had a hidden agenda with some of his paintings, but what that message was is still open to interpretation.  (It does look like there really was a women sitting at the table in his \\"Last Supper\\" painting to the right of Jesus.  Whether this person is supposed to be Mary Magdalene however is open to discussion.  This painting of course is Da Vinci's interpretation of that scene rather than based on anything that actually happened.)<br />I love a book that makes you think and go out and learn something new and this book by Dan Brown does that.  It reminded me a little of Michael Crichton's books like Jurassic Park or Congo, that take some real facts then ask what if, and lay out a believable story that leaves you scratching your head at the end wondering what is real.<br />Is the Catholic Church built on lies, and if so does it matter, or do we even care?  As a Catholic I remember being concerned years ago when I found out that Jesus might not have actually been born on December 25th, but that the Church choose this day to celebrate it since it coincided with other Pagan god's birthdays.  I wondered how many other things were done while setting themselves up to try to eliminate the competition, and this book just opened up a whole bunch of additional questions that I will now have to research and decide for myself on what is real.<br />The basic teachings of the church are still the same and have a good message.  That hasn't changed.  Even before reading this book however I have felt like something was missing from the church or needs to be changed.  Maybe by reading this book it will help point me in the right direction as to what I am looking for.<br />On a side note I saw that Nicholas Flamel the alchemist was listed as one of the previous Grand Masters of the Priory of Sion.

The original title was&quot;...and call me Conrad&quot;.<br />Anywise, although I still like &quot;Dune&quot; better, this book was a good read.<br />The Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear war.  Several parts are uninhabitable, and most humans have left the planet to go live on distant moons such as Titan.  What's left of the Earth has been turned into a great big Museum.<br />Aliens exist on another world, and use the Earth as a tourist site.  (They are blue and are called &quot;Vegans&quot; which was very confusing at first since I kept thinking they were referring to a person who doesn't eat meat or meat products.)<br />Conrad Nomikos is the curator of the Earth Museum.  He also used to be known as Konstantin Karaghiosis Korones Nomikos who supposedly was a demigod in Greek Mythology.  (I really wish I knew more Greek Mythology before reading this book since there are several references to it which might have had more meaning to me if I was more familiar with the history.)  Supposedly he has just been living for centuries but nobody noticed this until now, since he kept changing his name.<br />The nuclear fall out has caused mutations and brought many of the legends to life.  There are now centaurs, and sea serpents, and even a vampire roaming about the Earth.  And then there are other things such as Conrad's &quot;hell hound&quot; named Bortan which supposedly had just been around for centuries also without anyone taking notice until now.<br />Myshtigo is an alien who hires Conrad to take him on a tour of the Earth, supposedly so that he can write a book.  Several Earth groups which favor &quot;Returnism&quot; and want all Humans to return to Earth, want Myshtigo killed since they believe he is just conducting a survey of the Earth to buy it and make vacation resorts out of the whole thing.  One of these groups is called the &quot;Radpol&quot;.  Conrad used to be the founder of this group, and he needs to decide whether to allow these people to kill the alien, or whether based on a hunch, that he should protect him instead.  The future of the Earth may depend on his decision.  Due to his telepathic powers (yes, he has some of these to), he already knows that the Alien isn't really writing a book, but his telepathic powers don't work well enough to tell him everything, so there is still a mystery to solve.<br /><br />There is a lot of comparisons between the Earth on a larger scale and Greece, Rome, Egypt (you might even be able through France into this mix, but they are not mentioned).  These cities in our life time seem to have died.  These were once great and powerful nations who ruled the Earth.  Now tourists come to their land and expect them to act as second class citizens and servants who act as tour guides.  It seems that if they had a choice, that most who live in these nations would rather tear down all these old monuments which symbolize death to them and use the material to build a new and active living city, and be great once more.  It seems the only way they can become great again is to let go of the past.  Zelazny does this on a major scale by turning the Earth into a giant museum, then starting to tear down the major monument that remain in it.  This was a very powerful message it seemed for a while in this book, but then Zelazny chickens out in the end by not following through on it completely and compromises some of his ideas in the end.  He loses points with me here, but at least he gave me a new perspective on the subject.<br />P.S. just a side note for Tolkien fans.  There is also a cyborg fighting mechanism in this book named &quot;golem&quot;.this book named &quot;golem&quot;.	2003-10-06

Rowling deliberately let it slip that one of the main characters dies in this book, but if she did it works brilliantly.  She milks it for everything it's worth.  Every single major character it seems is on the brink of death at one point in this book and every time you start wondering, is it going to be them that dies?  It's very riveting.  Each chapter roles right into the next with a cliff hanger at the end, and you just want to read the first page of the next chapter to see if it clears things up.  Then you figure I'm already into the next chapter I might as well keep reading, and you get sucked in again.  I felt as if I wanted to rush forward and read it all in one sitting if possible, but then in the back of my mind it was telling me I should try to savor it a little more, as it might be years before the next one comes out.<br />When the book finally reached it's conclusion however, I found it a little bit of a let down.  I understand that there are going to be seven books in the series, and you couldn't tie up all of the lose ends in this episode, but I thought it needed a little more of a conclusion.  For example, I understand Gryffindor probably didn't win the house cup, but they didn't even mention who did.  You get the usual sit down meeting between Harry and Dumbledore where he takes most of the blame for not telling Harry things earlier, which may have made his life easier, but this seemed kind of a cop out.  Also, it's minor in comparison, but the story line which was built up between the Weasley's son Percy and his parents, wasn't resolved either.<br />There was a little more history on Harry's Aunt and Uncle, and at one point earlier in the story I actually felt a little bad for Dudley.  (I wonder if Rowling will have Harry and Dudley resolve their differences by the end of the series?)<br />Harry's character isn't as beloved by everyone as he usually is, and Dumbledore isn't the most respected wizard either.  I was fine with this, and thought it made a nice change.  I don't know if I was as happy however about questioning Harry's father's character though, as well as his father's friends.  I suppose Rowling didn't want to make anyone out to be a saint.<br />Hermione and Ron were solid companions for Harry as usual, and more people seemed to be joining Harry's inner circle (a.k.a. Neville, Ginny, etc.).  I especially liked the development with Neville's character, by giving more of a family history.<br />Harry's love interest with Cho was a new twist in the previous book as Harry started to mature, but it seemed kind of a waste in this book.  After finally getting used to the character Rowling gives her flaws and seems to end it.<br />In the end I also found what I believe were a few flaws with the story line.  When Harry leaves Grimauld place, his godfather Sirius gives him a package which he says contains something Harry can use if he ever needs to get in touch with him.  Harry tells himself that he will never use it however, because he doesn't want to be the one to lure Sirius out of Grimauld place and into harm, but then when Harry feels there is something he must talk over with Sirius, instead of using the means in which his godfather gave him to talk to him, he takes on all of these unnecessary risks to use another method.<br />One of the main plots of the story is that Lord Voldemort doesn't want to risk going into the Ministry of Magic himself to get the prophecy.  Why then after it is already broken does he then change his mind and go anyway?<br />Finally, I don't believe that the main character which they made out to be dead in the end is really dead.  Maybe it was written like this deliberately so that this person can come back, but there is no proof of death.  Also no good explanation if fully given regarding the room in the Ministry of Magic that this so called death occurred.<br />When the Empire Strikes back ended and several pieces of the story line were unresolved I felt cheated.  Then after Return of the Jedi came out and all was revealed, many people then felt that Empire was the best of the series.  Maybe once all is revealed in the Harry Potter series this book will be looked upon as the best of the lot as well.felt cheated.

Like the biblical Eden, man is once again shown to be imperfect and filled with original sin.  The boys live on an island where it seems they have no worries.  Fruit is available in plenty.  The weather is great.  There are no predators except themselves. Their fall from grace then comes when all this is shown to be not enough for them, and they kill a mother pig for meat.  There is no god, or devil on this island however, only man.  Ralph represents the good in man.  The descriptions of him are even godlike or golden, but Ralph is just a man (or boy).  Jack is described as the devil, but once again he is just a depiction of the worst of what is in man.  Simon and Piggy who represents man's wisdom fall in-between these other two individuals representing man himself, and both are flawed and killed.  The \\"Beast\\" which the children are afraid of first takes on the form of a serpent or snake and later the form of a \\"Great Ape\\" up on the mountain, but in each case the real danger comes from within however, as man is the one shown to have a heart of darkness.  When Simon talks to the \\"Lord of the Flies\\" it is all explained.  \\"Fancy thinking the beast was something you could hunt and kill!\\", \\"You knew didn't you?  I'm part of you?  Close, close, close!\\".  They can't hunt and kill the beast because they are the beast.  There is also no salvation.  When the children ask for a savior, or sign, what they are given was a dead Man (paratrooper).  It is all man.  This is not a book of hope.  Even in the end when the children are rescued there is still no hope, as the naval officer who rescues them is still just part of a greater war between men, and the Garden of Eden they leave behind has been turned into their own hell filled with fire.  I believe William Golding uses a lot of psychology in this book and each image takes on a deeper meaning.  It is not known how long the children are on the island, so it seems kind of timeless.  The number of children is also vague, which I think is deliberate.  They are also at times faceless children.  I thought it was wonderfully written and deserves to be listed as one of the best books ever written.  Even if it is a little depressing, it made me think.I believe William Golding uses a lot of psychology in this book and each image takes on a deeper meaning.

This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade.  When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith.  Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book.  His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse.  (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates.  I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)<br />Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs.  At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book.  He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella.  I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.<br />Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman.  The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book.  (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)<br />Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman.  It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money.  Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.<br />A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes.  (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)<br />In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.<br />There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve.  Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story.Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.<br />A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes.

To be saved, change must come from within, it can't be forced upon you.  You have to grow up on your own.  If you lose your free will, then you are no longer human and thus can not love or dream.  You become in a way a living mechanical thing, or, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\".<br />Anthony Burgess' novel is wonderful, and touches upon several issues with the criminal justice system which still exist today.  Should prisons be used to punish, or to reform?  If they are used to punish then does the prisoner become a victim?  What about the victims?  Should they be allowed to have their revenge?  Also, what can be done about overcrowding?<br />The book was also full of lots of irony.  In having the main character facing many of his old victims in the later chapters, I thought it seemed very much like a Frank Capra type of movie.  However, instead of seeing how much worse life would have been like for all his friends and family if he had not been born, (like it was in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"), you get to see how badly the main character had affected all of his victims by coming into their lives.<br />This particular novel contains a controversial last chapter which differs from the version which Stanley Kubrick used to base his movie upon.  It seems that the last chapter was originally cut out of the United States version of the novel, and only the British novels had the last one.  Now it has been added back in.  I can't picture the movie having been any better by having added this extra chapter back into it, but it was good to read the novel the way the author had intended, and it works well in the book form.<br />After seeing the movie I was surprised to see how short the novel was (less than two hundred pages), but it was packed with excitement.  One of the best books I ever read.	2002-12-30

You can be discharged from duty during war if you are insane. But Catch-22 points out that only people who are insane would participate in war to begin with, so if you know you should not be participating in it, then you're sane, and thus have to serve.<br />John Yosarian the main character reminds me a lot of Corporal Klinger from M.A.S.H., (I'm sure that that T.V. show had to have used this book as a model, if not intentionally, then at least subconsciously), but unlike Corporal Klinger who is trying to get a section 8 to get out of the war because he's lazy, Yosarian is trying to get a section 8 to get out of the war to save his life. It's not as funny when you put it that way.<br />This book was quite an emotional roller coaster ride. It's full of sarcasm which I like, but it's Joke, Joke, Joke, and then someone dies. When that happens I didn't know whether I was supposed to laugh or cry.<br />Then just when you get used to this type of format it changes to the reverse where it touches upon a really sincere issue, and then hits you with more satire to follow it up.<br />The tension in the book keeps mounting and mounting as the number of missions a bombardier needs to fly to qualify to go home keeps mounting. You find yourself routing for the character just to survive.<br />It's full of lot's of irony, and all of the characters are wonderful. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I'm sure each one of them represents some part of his psyche. Overall it was a very good book.<br />P.S. A movie based on the book came out in 1970.	2002-12-20

Even if the rest of the book wound up being half decent, the whole premise which this particular story was based on was asinine.  I couldn't believe the scenario Card used was the best he could come up with to have Achilles escape from China.  Why would you try to make use of someone you know is a psychopathic killer, and who's connections probably have already been used up, when you already have working for you three other so called genius who have already beaten this guy?  And then, even if you get this psycho to work for you the way you wanted him to, which is at best a long shot, you would still lose out because the other geniuses you already had working for you would leave.  It just didn't make any sense.  Also I thought the story line of using Achilles as the main villain had already run it's course in the last novel.  By using him again here it seemed like Card ran out of ideas for an arch rival for Bean and rather than think of a new twist he just reused an old one.  It also seemed that he just wrote this novel to set up future ones to come, which overall I don't have too much of a problem with, since there may be some promise in them, but it's a shame he couldn't have spent more time in properly working on the current one first.	2002-11-07

Anderson have done with this series of prequels to the classic \\"Dune\\".  The latest trilogy goes back a thousand years further and shows a lot of the religious and political history that lead to the world depicted in the classic novel.  It is one of those books you just don't want put down.  It is a battle fought for mankind's freedom, against computers, and Cymeks (which are machines which human minds.)  This book touches upon where the hatred between the Harkonnens's and the Atreides originated from which I guess is going to be over a girl.  With a new twist which I liked, a Harkonnen is the good guy in this story and an Atreides is one of the bad guys.  (The Atreides is too naive to know he is fighting for the wrong side.)  Agamemnon who is a cymek general and the father of Vorian Atreides reminded me in ways of Darth Vadar trying to corrupt his son over to the dark side to follow in his foot steps.  I must also admit that the first line I heard one of the cymeks (who were twenty titans which ruled the world before the computers took over) make, reminded me of the \\"Borg\\" from Star Trek, but I'm glad to say that from then on the similarities ended.  (I'm also not sure if the characters name Vorian, known through out the book as Vor is a tribute to Lois McMaster Bujold's Vor novels which are also very good by the way.)  The \\"Omnius\\" computer who is the head of the computer world is a decent character, but the computer Erasmus who is trying to understand humanity is very interesting, even if he does remind you of an evil mentat.  Insights are also gained into the beginnings of the new Empire, the inventor Tio Holtzman and his shields,  the original Suk doctor, the beginnings of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, spice trading on Arrakis, worm riding, and the Bene Tlulax.

To be honest, when I first heard it was a story about a bunch of rabbits I wasn't very optimistic that it could have anywhere near as much action in it as it did. I was pleasantly surprised however to see that I was wrong in this regard.<br />The main character is a buck named Hazel (not exactly the name I would have picked for a main character) who leads by utilizing the best assets of the other rabbits around him, each of which has his own special attribute. (They are either a good fighter, runner, storyteller, fortuneteller, tracker, builder, or has the ability to cheer everyone up around them with a good joke.)<br />Due to a premonition that one of the rabbits received (Fiver), Hazel leads a group of rabbits to find a new burrow before impending doom falls upon the warren they lived in. On the way they have to avert many dangers and overcome several difficulties.<br />At one point they find a burrow of rabbits who look in excellent health, but they have some dark hidden secret which they are not sharing. It reminds me of a scene out of H.G. Wells' 'The Time Machine' when the main character travels into the future to finds people being treated like cattle.<br />Richard Adams does an excellent job maintaining all of the rabbits nuances while at the same time giving them additional human attributes. They behave in military fashion, have a type of religion, create art, play games, make up poems, and tell stories. (I especially loved the stories of El-ahrairah who is a very clever rabbit much like Brair-rabbit.)<br />Some of the rabbits in this book have tried to better themselves. In some instances this is shown as a good thing, and in others it is quite harmful. This is done similar to how Mary Shelly in her novel 'Frankenstein' showed the effects of what happens when man tries to act like God.<br />General Woundwort who is the villain is shown in both regards. His warren is prosperous and safe, but he eventually turns into a tyrant. He also has the strength to take on bigger animals than himself which is an unnatural trait for a rabbit.<br />Overall I'd say this book was excellent, and I think it deserves to be listed as one of the best novels of all time./>General Woundwort who is the villain is shown in both regards.

Since horses are no longer used for everyday transportation and labor however, the book loses some impact, but it is still a very well written and insightful book which captures a period in history where steam engines are just starting to replace horses. The country is on the verge of an industrial revolution and you can feel man's pressure from society to go faster, longer, and harder. Anna Sewell seems troubled that this increased pace may ruin and wear out men as easily as it starts to wear out the horses. The effects on the horses are only a warning to what is to come for man unless something is done. She shows the effects of working 7 day weeks without a rest, as well as 14 hour days. Sewell also mentions many other topics which animal rights supporters have picked up in later years. An example of this would be a few shots she takes at people who do harm to animals out of the sake of fashion without any regard for the animals. She also mentions several scenarios of animal abuse and makes comparisons to child abuse. She believes people who do not stand up when they see injustices are just as guilty as the perpetrators. The horse 'Black Beauty' is given many human qualities which is very effective. I do not know if a modern day book about love of cars would be as effective as the love that is shown in this book for a living animal. On a side note, I'd be curious what Anna Sewell's opinion would have been on euthanasia. Whenever she mentions horses getting old and unable to do their work, several times she says it would be better for them to be put out of their misery with a bullet to the head. This is a little disturbing to me since these horses all have such human characteristics. Overall though the thing that comes through the most is Anna Sewell's sincere love of these animals.	2002-07-18

I realize that may be the author's intention, but it left me searching for meaning where there was none.  Everyone is mad in wonderland, or they wouldn't be there.  It's hard to call it an adventure, since nothing really happens.  The characters are all mean, and at times unlikable.  I get the pun, I can see the satire, but I just didn't find it funny.  I have two daughter's who are 4 and 5, and I tried reading it to them as well to see if it might be a generational thing, but since most of the book is a play on words, they did not understand it, and they did not like it any better.  I'm sorry.  I'll admit Carroll has quite an imagination, and created quite a unique world, but he didn't do anything with it.  I feel bad for having seen Disney's classic animation adaptation of this story first, and for hoping to gain some added insight by reading the actual book, but there is nothing more here to be gained.  It did make me appreciate the job Disney did in adapting it to a movie however.  I believe he (Disney) captured the images perfectly.	2002-07-11

I can't wait to go home and read it to my two girls.  They loved the movie, and though this is slightly different, it is just as good of a story, if not better.  While the movie implies that maybe by hitting her head, Dorothy may have dreamt the whole story, here in the book it seems to be a real world to which you can travel to.  The characters of the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion are original and compelling.  Although the lion in the movie version is great, I liked the one in this book even better.  The book at times even reminded me of one of my other favorite children's stories which was \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", in which you have children fighting battles and leading adventures with a great lion.  It's almost a shame Dorothy would want to return to Kansas, and leave such a beautiful land behind.  L. Frank Baum says in his introduction that unlike the Grimm Fairy Tales, or stories by Hans Christian Anderson which were written with children suffering throughout the story for them to learn a moral lesson, Baum just wanted to write this story to entertain children instead.  Although I am no longer a child, I'd have to admit that I was quite entertained.	2002-07-10

Barrie's Peter Pan & Wendy	Books	5	6	7	N	N	One of the Best Children's Stories of all Time	This original story version is a little darker than the Disney one, but wonderful none the less.  The Neverland which for the most part you can only get to in dreams, is filled with pirates right out of \\"Treasure Island\\", Indians from \\"The Last of the Mohican\\", as well as mermaids, fairies, flying children, and wild creatures.<br />Peter Pan represents youth, and his arch rival Captain James Hook is age always fighting with youth and time.  The story is one big adventure told in a way which is humorous, and compelling.  There is constant danger, but never prolonged suspense to bring any real concern over the outcome.  At times Peter is as much a villain to the children as he is a hero.  I never considered before that children could be heartless, but I guess they do not have much of a conscious when they are that young.<br />I'd rank this as one of the best children's stories of all time.	2002-07-08

Forget the fact that it is poorly written with Daniel Defoe repeating himself several times throughout the first half of the book (an example would be that he retells the first three years of his life on the island at least three times in different forms), but that the character of Robinson Crusoe is such a despicable person.<br />How do I even begin. You have a spoiled rich kid who doesn't listen to his father's advise and sets out to see the world. He is taken prisoner and made a slave. When he finally does escape you would think that he would have learned from this experience how wrong it is to enslave others, but he doesn't. He sets up a tobacco plantation in Brazil and sets out on a voyage to Africa to enslave men to work on his plantation, when he is shipwrecked. All others on the boat are drown.<br />How am I supposed to feel bad for this individual? He says he has no companionship, but he doesn't deserve any. It isn't until he is on the island for several chapters that he even mentions the fact that a dog survived from the shipwreck. He had listed every last essential object he had saved from the ship several times in the earlier chapters, but since a dog means nothing to him, it is an afterthought. He has cats, but drowns the kittens. I understand he needed to eat, but this character has no morals. The island he is on is one of the few that turtles breed on, and he kills them readily. He kills a dolphin, (I'm not sure how exactly he did this, when he was on land). He kills goats while they are with their kids, and then when the kids follow him home he kills them as well. If there had been any baby seals on the island I have not doubts he would have clubbed them all to death.<br />When he finally meets the savage Friday he is happier to have a servant than to have a companion. I find it humorous that the man giving this savage religious counsel has no Christian morals himself. Crusoe thinks he is a good Christian, but he only looks to God when his life is in peril, and then he quickly forgets his teachings during all other fazes of his everyday world. He thinks God has cursed him. I think it is probably more that He is trying to protect the rest of the world from him.<br />The character Friday is one of the few things I liked about the book, when he forces Crusoe to question his own beliefs. Crusoe however takes everything about the savage for granted. How can you blame Friday for wanting to be in his own country. When Friday comes upon his Father in need, and is taking care of him, Crusoe is like a little baby that is upset because Friday isn't spending enough time serving him. Crusoe even puts down Friday's religion, when he doesn't even understand his own. Then when he converts Friday over to Christianity and Friday asks Crusoe to come over to his island and to help and teach his people, all Crusoe can think of is himself.<br />Later Crusoe becomes aware of some Spaniards shipwrecked on the mainland. While he is waiting for them to return, he himself is rescued. Instead of having his rescuers who become indebted to him, go over to the mainland to assist the Spaniards, he just leaves them. From one who knows what is it like to be shipwrecked himself, and that they are in danger over there, this is unacceptable. I can't believe Friday just leaves without inquiring about his father either.<br />Then in the end Crusoe returns, obtains money and goes back to the island and enslaves many of the savages. I kept hoping when the savages came to his island that they would have tracking skills like the Indians in the \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" and that they'd find him out and killed him. Or that Friday would be more like the savage Queequeg in \\"Moby Dick\\" who stayed true to his own religious beliefs.

I wish I had had time to read this when I was younger since it was obviously written with younger readers in mind, but I enjoyed it just as well at my current age, and I look forward to reading it to my own children.<br />Since this was written for a younger reader, there is a lot of foreshadowing, which takes the edge off of the mystery and suspense.  I guess Stevenson did not want the younger readers to worry to much about whether the main character is going to be all right, so that they could focus more on enjoying the story.<br />This story has everything.  Buried treasure, maps, one legged pirates, people walking the plank, talking parrots, murder, secret islands, hangings, sea adventure, drunken sailors, and songs.  I can see where Jimmy Buffet probably got a lot of inspiration for some of his songs.<br />Long John Silver is a despicable character that you can't help admiring one minute, and hating the next, only to find yourself somewhere in between at the end of the story.  He's brave and cunning, but very conniving.  Jim Hawkins is an excellent young character who has the habit of always being in the right place at the right time.  He is young and impressionable, and I'm sure most of the readers can relate to him, and put themselves in his shoes.  Captain Flint, who's character is not actually in the book still carries a lot of weight as an evil villain.  Other characters not mentioned like the Doctor, Captain Smollett, and the Squire are quite honorable and hold their own throughout the story.<br />No matter how deranged and twisted it might seem, these pirates have their own laws and their own coat of honor which they keep to in one way or other throughout the story.  I wonder if Stevenson based this on any actual facts he may have obtained regarding real pirate's or whether he invented it all in his head.  Regardless it is fascinating how they justify their actions.  This book is on several lists as one of the top 100 books ever written, and I thoroughly agree with their assessment.  The images drawn is this particular book were wonderful, and really captured each scene.t is fascinating how they justify their actions.

Unlike others on these types of lists which did not live up to the hype, this one succeeded.<br />You are brought into another world and given a perspective of another culture.  I couldn't believe a book written at that time would contain so much graphic images.  I had read books before who had characters in them which they called savages, but it was not until this book that I actually saw what savagery really was.  The aftermath of the attack on Fort William Henry contains some very shocking descriptions. Indians have different morals and superstitions, and Cooper does a good job of explaining the differences while at the same time differentiating between good and evil.  Bravery as always is still highly respected by all.<br />The story was wonderful, and the characters were memorable.  There is a lot of character development.  Even the villain's character of Magua grows and grows, from a mer scout to a formidable opposing chief.  Cora, is a very strong female character, which to me is unique for a story written during that time period.  The character of David Gamut adds some humor and an image of a free spirit who stays true to his religion, but Hawkeye the scout, Uncas the warrior and his father Chingachgook are the powerful characters that anyone would want to emulate.  Heyward the young British officer comes off a little stiff, but he is very honorable.<br />I liked the fact that Cooper incorporated some actual real life characters into his story and gave us all a little history lesson.  For instance Washington is mentioned briefly and Cooper insinuates that Washington probably learned his guerilla tactics for fighting the British during his days in the French and Indian Wars.  He also mentions two other real life generals in a way which adds to the story without being accused of character defamation.<br />I'm not sure if I would call this a love story since it was mostly filled with battle scenes and war tactics, but there was a lot of love to go around.  Even with the differences in culture there is still a similarity between the love shown between the father Munro and his daughters, (as a father of two daughters myself I felt his anguish Munro felt in worrying about the safety of his girls), and the love shown between and the Indian father Chingachgook and his son Uncas. You have a special bond of brothers between Hawkeye and Uncas, and you also have the love story between Heyward and one of Munro's daughters as well.<br />While I found the book to be excellent, there are three minor criticisms I will make.  Every character seems to have at least three names which is confusing at times.  One which is their real name, another their friends call them, and yet a third which their enemies may bestow upon them.  Also I do not speak French, and there are a few discussions throughout the book in French which are not interpreted.  It didn't ruin the story since I could guess what was probably said, but it was slightly annoying.  Finally the book title itself gives away more of the story than I would have liked with it's foreboding.<br />The character Alan Alda played on the old T.V. show M.A.S.H. had always said that his favorite book was \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" and his favorite character was Hawkeye.

Dickens explores this premise in his novel 'Oliver Twist' quite effectively, while creating some of the most memorable characters ever written.  (The Artful Dodger, Fagin, Charlie Bates, etc..) At the same time he also captures the essence of Victorian England perfectly. (At times while reading I even felt that I was there with them, wondering around in the dark of some of these houses waiting for a candle to be drawn to show me the way.)  Oliver is an orphan just trying to stay alive in an unsympathetic world.  He falls into the company of pickpockets and thieves, and battles to maintain his moral character.  He catches some breaks, but seems to always be plagued with the worst luck. (You find out later that not all of it is coincidence, as forces are deliberately working against him.)  Most of the so called bad guys are not all bad, and not everybody with the proper upbringing is good.  You feel a sense of sympathy for the people living under these conditions and at times can't blame them for what they have become.  Even Fagin you find yourself rooting for at times, even though he's the one ruining so many young lives by corrupting them into his own way of life.  Even if corrupted though, this book still shows a few people willing to change their ways, either for good or bad.  You are not caste into one mold.  My only critique of Dickens and this novel is that it was originally written for a magazine in which Dickens was paid by the word. At times it is very obvious he has drawn out a description or a point beyond what was necessary.	2002-03-20

I'm not sure if inspiration was drawn from these novels, or whether others I'm familiar with were the inspiration for these.  Regardless of which came first, these were wonderful.  I highly recommend them for children and I've started reading them to my daughter who's five and she's enjoyed them thoroughly.  I've found comparisons in them to Harry Potter, The planet of the Apes, Gulliver's Travels, The Wizard of Oz, The Lord of the Rings, Peter Pan, Pinocchio, and Arthur and the Round Table.  The closest comparison however is to the Old Testament of the Bible.  (Which to be honest I haven't read in an awfully long time), Adam and Eve, Noah's Arc, Jesus being born in a stable to dying on the Cross for our sins.  Finally the book of Revelations.  It's all in here only written into a story line which makes it more entertaining, and easier for children to understand.  The moral of the stories still come through.  After reading this it makes it hard not to consider the old testament as a fairly tale as well.  I'm sure this wasn't the authors intent, since I'd say the author is definitely pro Catholicism, but the religious overtones are too many to be overlooked.  Even as a fairy tale they show right from wrong, and are a good example of the kind of morals you would like to instill in your children.	2002-02-04

He is no longer just a rifle, a bayonet, a grenade, but a living breathing human being. The book is told from the perspective of a World War I German Soldier, and while you are reading it you can not help thinking how much he sounds just like any other 20 year old boy regardless of whether he is a German, American, French, Russian, or British soldier. As an American male, Germany was our enemy and was always looked upon as being evil. You are not supposed to think of these people as human beings. It would make fighting them that much harder to learn that their foot soldiers really were not much different than ours. The fact that they had mothers, fathers, and loved ones at home praying for their safety, just as ours did, is moving.<br />The book does not bother going into details of the cause of the war, which is good, but just focuses on the foot soldier who is actually fighting it. The book is fictitious, but it gives surprisingly accurate descriptions of the war, and gives you a good perspective of what they went through. This illustrated edition is great and helped clarify in my mind actually what was described in the book.<br />You can also see hints of the feeling of the country preceding World War II. At the end of World War I, Germany was defeated, but their foot soldiers felt that they were not out classed, but only out manned. Also most of the fighting was done in other countries, so Germans were not subjected to images of giant craters which had ripped apart most of the landscape. Those at home in Germany suffered, but their elders were disillusioned regarding the superiority of their military might, and the consequences war was costing them.<br />The prospective on the war propaganda is magnificent. Scenes of teachers instilling in their students the image that war is glorious and prompting them to rush out and enlist, only to find that war is hell, and death is all that awaits most of them is very powerful. Older gentleman in town arguing over how the war should be won, without any real concept of the consequences are great. Realistic problems which these youths suffered upon returning home from the war are also raised. It is mentioned of how this generation of Germans would have trouble fitting back into society because war was all they knew reminds me of our American soldiers returning from Vietnam. Both were at war for long periods of time and returned home from a losing war.<br />I picked this book up because I saw it mentioned on a list of \\"The One Hundred Greatest Books Ever Written\\".

Darwin doesn't overload you with endless facts and information which would bore you to death and distract you from understanding his essential theories.  Not that facts and tests are irrelevant.  He has done tests and has lots of data, but he keeps this separately for those who wish to build upon his theories or dispute them.  He uses just a few examples to prove his points, and the results are remarkable.<br />There are several points in time which have changed the way people look upon the world around us.  Finding out the world is not flat, but rather round is one.  The Earth revolves around the Sun, rather than the reverse, and that all of the continents used to all be connected at one time, are a few more.  Darwin's Theory of evolution rates right up there with these.  For someone believing that the world evolved from Adam and Eve I can't imagine how upset he made these people feel by suggesting that we may have evolved from Monkeys, or some amphibian creature.  Darwin's theories that animals (humans included) may have evolved from just four or five different progenitors, and that plants may have evolved from even fewer, or that we all may have evolved from just one species is fascinating.  I believe he approaches it just the right way.  He doesn't argue or criticize.  He just lays it out there and you are forced to acknowledge it.  Darwin keeps religion our of the equation.  If religious groups want to go on there to name the amphibian being which crawled out of the ocean for the first time onto land Adam, that would probably be all right with him, so long as you admitted that their probably was such a being.<br />Science has improved since Darwin's day's and geology and archeology has improved, but he is still correct that we will not be able to find perfect fossils after all of these years to match all of the changes.  Some of his other thoughts and comments I do not know whether to contribute to the period in which he wrote them to or just as preliminary thoughts that the actual tests would disprove.<br />For instance, Darwin mentions that he believes characteristics are only passed down to males to make them more capable of obtaining a mate and reproducing.  Characteristics such as increased strength, brighter colors, and the ability to sing.  However I would believe that other or similar traits would be passed down to the females as well to make them more attractive to male suitor, forcing them to want to fight over these particular females more than others.<br />Also Darwin mentions that the strongest produce the most descendants.  In our society today that is not necessarily true.  Money is associated with power or strength.  Someone who has two kids may have more money and be considered to have more power.  Since they live within their means they may be able to afford a better house, and to put their kids through colleges, as opposed to a family with seven kids in which they live by lesser means, and are unable to afford the same amenities as the family with just two kids, because they have less money to go around.  The family with seven kids by this example may not be considered the strongest since they have more money, but yet they have the most descendants.he wrote them to or just as preliminary thoughts that the actual tests would disprove.<br />For instance, Darwin mentions that he believes characteristics are only passed down to males to make them more capable of obtaining a mate and reproducing.

The times when someone else besides the governess is speaking it becomes hard to follow who is talking.  However after completing this novella, I realize this style may have been needed to raise some questions in the reader's minds whether or not the governess is just imagining all that she sees, or whether there really are ghosts about the manor trying to corrupt these cherub like children to do unspeakable evil.  At times I felt the suspense was forced.  Too many pages were used to explain why she just didn't come out and confront the children in the first place, speak to their uncle, or speak to someone at the school.  The introductory pages of people telling ghost stories seemed unnecessary as well since it is never tied back in to the story at the end.  At times the story shows so much potential to build you up to a great surprise climax at the end, but then in my opinion, it falls short.	2001-12-05

If it wasn't for that fact I may not have given it as much leeway when I first read it however.  With a completely different language and universe, I found it hard at the beginning to get into the mind set of the book, and to associate with that world. Of course once I did, it became one of the best books I've ever read.  Several other people I've known over the years had similar troubles starting the novel, and I was saddened to learn that they never completed it.<br />After reading the three prequals which Frank Herbert's son Brian and Kevin J. Anderson have put together, House Corrino being the last, I can't help wondering if things would have been different for these people if these novels were the first books in the series that they had read.  They are all well written, enough so to keep a reader coming back for more on their own weight.  They are true to the original story, enough so that they have added some great insight which you do not get from the original.  Also, I believe, they are an easier read.  Which may attract more readers to this wonderful series which otherwise may have been a little intimidated.  These prequels set up the original perfectly.  I highly recommend these books.	2001-11-26

They do touch upon this at times with philosophical discussions between Sal Paradise and his spiritual guide Dean Moriarity, who is both Angel and Devil, and I loved that, but there is not enough of it.  There was not enough insight or purpose.  Overall, it was just depressing.  I thought it would make me want to go out and cross the U.S. on my own pilgrimage.  Instead it made me want to stay a little closer to home.  The reason I believe, is that I know the country he is describing is gone now.  He captured it very well, but that time is over.  If I duplicated his quest I'd find a much different America.  A scarier one.  It's just not safe to travel the way he did any more.  Hell, by his descriptions, I'd say it wasn't safe then either.  I'd still like to see these things, but I'd take more precautions.  I realize that might ruin it, but I'm too old now to die by doing some of the stupid things they carried out.  He certainly didn't glorify that life style.  I loved the descriptions of the Jazz clubs however.  The way Kerouac describes them, the music would play in my head and I dug that.  I never even liked Jazz before.	2001-10-16

If I've learned anything from this book it is that &quot;Quility&quot; is &quot;Reality&quot;.  &quot;'Quality' is the parent, the source of all subjects and objects.  &quot;Any intellectually conceived object is always in the past and therefore unreal.  Reality is always the moment of vision before the intellectualization takes place.  There is no other reality.&quot;  &quot;Religion isn't invented by man.  Men are invented by religion.  Men invent responses to Quality, and amoung these responses is an understanding of what they themselves are.&quot;  This is one of the best books I've ever read.  It forced me to think and look at the world in a new perspective.	2001-09-24

The first two parts are the most famous, where Gulliver visits a land in which he is a giant and another in which it is filled with giants. Although they are very good, I found them somewhat boring. This is probably due tot he fact that I had heard these stories in so many variations already, they no longer had that originality to them. The next two parts however I found to be excellent. Several authors have expounded upon these stories or have continued them in one form of another of them. It is good to finally find the source of such great insight. For example the world in the clouds is quite humorous, and Douglas Adams makes a similar use of this satire in one of his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe series. The island of wizard's where you can call up any of the dead to have them tell their part in history can be seen in &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot; by Philip Jose Farmer (a Hugo award winner.) The final part about humans being nothing but Yahoos, and inferior to Horses is brilliant. A reversal of roles with other animals to give us a new perspective of ourselves is imitated in other such classics as &quot;The Time Machine&quot; by H.G. Wells, &quot;The Island of Dr. Monreau&quot; also by H.G. Wells, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell, plus several Star Trek and Twilight Zone episodes.	2001-08-29
US	51228288	R1P0AI2SS9YS1G	0140444173	748295604	War and Peace (Penguin Classics)	Books	3	1	4	N	N	War and Peace: Excitement and Boredom	As the title indicates this book is split up into two parts. One about War and the other about peace time during the invasion of Russia by Napoleon. The War part is excellnt and gives you an insight into this period of time which you can not find anywhere else. The peace times however are very boring and hard to suffer through. I'd have actually given the book three and one half stars if given the option.	2001-08-29

They said something similar to the fact that &quot;the book did not ruin the Dune series, but it did not add anything to  it either&quot;.  After reading the book myself I have to respectfully  disagree with their assessment of the book.  I thought this book was  great, and I was very much a skeptic going into it.  I am now very much  looking forward to reading the sequel to &quot;Chapter House Dune&quot;  which Brian mentioned he is proposing to write at the end of this novel.  I must admit I was weary of a famous father's son trying to pick up his  father's work and running with it.  You never know if they are just trying  to make a buck off of their father's name.  Brian, after reading this novel  I see that is not the case, and that you really must love this story.  Your  father would be proud.	2000-05-26

After reading this one I recommended to a few friends that they read the first one just so that they could get to this one.  I've read everything Isaac Asimov has ever written,  but nothing by Greg Bear except perhaps maybe one of his short stories.  Now that Isaac is gone, I now look forward to checking out what other  novels Mr Bear has written.	2000-05-26
