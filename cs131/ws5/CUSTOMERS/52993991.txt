I found this work to be an enjoyable read as the adventure brought us in contact with the mysterious Havasupai people in the inner gorge. <br /> <br />Like many readers, I wish that Mr. Hillerman had spent more time honing this novel. I wish the book gave us more information on the trails into the canyon and spent more time with the Havasupai. <br /> <br />I am giving the work 5 stars as the work does a pretty good job entwining the plot with the legends of Masaw (Skeleton Man). <br /> <br />Of course, my expectations weren't high on this 14 iteration of the Chee/Leaphorn formula. A quick read, where Mr. Hillerman's prose fell short, I simply let my imagination fill in the gaps.	2005-01-16

Books	2	33	43	N	N	Well Marketed Fluff	Like &quot;Who Stole My Cheese&quot; this is an extremely light short story couched between a forward that heaps praise on the story and an afterward that lays claims to life altering effects that result from reading the story.<br />The story itself is fluff about learning from the past, living in the present and preparing for the future...mixed in with a great deal of praise about the story.<br />It is a very interesting format...the book spends about half of its effort praising itself. It praises you for being so smart as to read and seek wisdom from this totally wise and pure author. This is an interesting format for creating a &quot;feel good&quot; story.<br />But I am a kurmudgeon who doesn't like marketing hype, and have a history of tossing wrenches in marketing schemes...two stars, and no recommend.<br />BTW: If you are a CEO planning a major re-engineering...you should consider giving a copy of &quot;Who Stole My Cheese&quot; to all the people you laid off, and a copy of &quot;The Present&quot; to the people you expect to work harder with your reduced workforce. It will make you feel wonderful about yourself. In fact, you might even want to increase your stock options.	2003-11-01

For example, Tensleep centers around the drilling of an oil well, Faultline centers around seismology.<br />Flesh and Bones is a wonderful story, and has some of Sarah Andrew's best character development. My only disappointment was the lack of the geologic theme. <br />Flesh and Bones begins with a voyeuristic look into the life of a Mariam Menkin. Mariam was a baby boomer who betrayed both her sex and the sixties to marry a \\"nice guy.\\" In this work, we find scattered pieces of Mariam's diary and gradually glue together the pieces of how and why she was murdered.<br />The book brings us on a tour of Wyoming and Colorado as Em Hansen digs up clues in Douglas, Denver and Saratoga Springs. We meet good and bad cattle ranchers and some suspicious activities at oil companies.<br />If you are reading the Em Hansen series for the geological themes; you can skip this one. Even in the overall development of the Em Hansen character, Only Flesh and Bones plays a less important role than the other works. If you have limited time for reading, I would read all the other novels first.	2003-03-22

You can see from the reviews that it is controversial. Reading controversial literature generally makes people more well rounded.<br />The controversy doesn't revolve around the merits of the book. Any book that touches a religious theme has the same source of antagonism. A large number of people reading the history of Joseph Smith are doing so to ask the question: Was Smith truly the divine relevator of God or was he a charlatan?<br />Such controversies are always mysteries.<br />Accurate historical and scientific research has a wreckless history of messing with beliefs based on revelation. Look at the job that Copernicus did on the Catholic Church with his little diagrams suggesting the earth was round.<br />Ms. Brodie was a faithful member of the LDS Church who changed her mind on this issue while doing her historical research. Yes, she is an apostate. She brings to the surface many of the facts that led to her conclusions.<br />Of course, it should be noted that she is researching in a field where others have done twisting of facts to cast Smith as a living saint.<br />Over all, it appears to be an extremely well researched work in a field where all of the research is questionable in nature. If you are interested in LDS or Utah history, I would strongly recommend the book.<br />If your are wanting to read the accepted version of Joseph Smith's life, I would recommend reading The Work and The Glory by Gerald Lund. <br />If you enjoy learning, I would pick up Brodie's book, it is far more interesting.	2003-03-22

On completing \\"The Baby Boon\\", I just had to run out and read the comments on Amazon. It never even dawned on me that people would even be allowed to think such politically incorrect thoughts about the spawners (I mean parents). <br />The book is vague enough, that different groups can take away whatever they want from the book. There is enough whining in the book, that the people who love all the special perks will be able to label it as feminist whining. The childless can find self validation, etc..<br />The book has many hidden gems. I was especially intrigued with the way that Bill Clinton sold out the traditional support base of the Democratic Party and bought the Baby Boom vote with the promise of special treatment for Baby Booming parents.<br />It is also interesting to see how quick Republican, who had been arguing for lower taxes and fiscal constraint, were willing to sell out when handed bags of special little perks.<br />If you are wondering. I happen to be childless. I was born at the end of the Baby Boom. My particular whine is that Reagan cancelled the scholarship program I needed to finish college. The government slashed spending on college education right after the boomers. <br />I borrowed heavily into my senior year. The loans gave out before my last quarter's tuition. My life is a simple equation of massive student loans and no degree. Consequently, the people I care about the most are students.<br />If the book really wanted to make an impact. It would have mentioned the great burden put on the youth of this nation by all the perks dished out today. Today's students are coming out of College in to a dreadful labor market with record setting college loans and credit card debt. The US is setting record deficits, and there is an expectation that our children will somehow make enough in their lives to pay the generous Social Security benefits that the Baby Boomers will demand while pay back the six trillion dollar deficit that the boomers ran up.<br />Responsible students put off children until they have their finances in order. So the tax breaks work against people hoping to start families. Many students today come out of college with $100,000 plus in credit card debt and loans. The perks hurt the responsible young students who work off their debt. As such, responsible graduates will put off children even longer.<br />The baby boomers tax grants aren't simply a transfer of wealth from the single to the married. It is a massive transfer of wealth and potential from young couple trying to get a toehold in the world to the established middle class. Ultimately, it is a tax that penalizes those who are responsible in planning for a family to those that drop kids without thinking.<br />I think \\"Baby Boon\\" is an important read because it shows us how the dialogue in American politics gets turned, spun and twisted until it is impossible to say which way is left or right. The only real conclusion is that mass transfers of wealth by the government has losers as well as winners. (We will always have whiners) Personally, I have no faith in the government's ability to decide which groups should be the winners and losers. The law of unintended consequences usually catch up with all government mandated wealth transfers.	2003-03-05

You will meet some of the finest law minds from the small town south. There is the mysterious gruff Judge Atlee who is trying to hold onto an idealized old south, and two sons taking different paths. The eldest son becomes a professor of law--where he finds his personal ethics not quite as clear cut as his fathers--and the younger brother who lost all sense of anything through years of addiction.<br />In a Grisham style twist, the author throws in a few million bucks--just to see how the characters fare. Sudden wealth is a good way to clarify character, but the plot was unrealistic enough that I couldn't see any value in the conflicts.<br />The only thing I could see in the book is that yes, most people probably hide some assets from the estate when a parent dies.<br />I gave the book a three, but would recommend skipping this one and moving on to the &quot;King of Torts&quot; which handles the same sudden wealth dilemma with an interesting plot and brutal commentary on mass tort and class action suits.	2003-02-22

If you are a fan of the series, Tensleep is a must read. I am really surprised that this, Sarah Andrews first (and in some ways best) novel is out of print. The book is great. It is worth the $$$$ you will have to pay for a used copy.<br />In Tensleep, Em Hansen begins to discover her inner talents as an investigator. With a shiny new degree in geology, Ms. Hansen lands the traditional male job of mudlogger on a drilling rig. While handling all the garbage dished out by the good ole boy network in drilling, our young heroine finds more than she bargained for: The rig she is working is plagued by mysterious deaths and sabotage.<br />The work is fascinating, as Sarah Andrews describes the politics and processes of drilling for oil. <br />Sarah Andrews makes excellent use of drilling as a literary device. Em Hansen must solve both the mysteries of the oil company and that of the Tensleep formation. In my humble opinion, Tensleep is one of highlights of the Em Hansen series. I hope the publishers get their act in gear and print up a new edition for Sarah Andrews fans.	2003-02-16

The author notes correctly that many people use \\"niceness\\" as a means to manipulate others, and that people using a veneer of niceness to manipulate others often end up hurting themselves and their loved ones. The author is even correct in the diagnosis that the cure for this problem is learning to be true to yourself.<br />Unfortunately, the book carries the thesis that the problem is in being nice. This is his false premise. The real problem is that people who use kindness to manipulate others are manipulative. The problems that the author faced in his life and that he sees in many of his clients is that they are extremely manipulative.<br />The minor thesis of and major promise of the book is that, if a nice guy stops being \\"nice\\" to others, he will get more sex, and learn to bend others to his will. The unfortunate implication of this minor thesis is that it just turns the client from one type of manipulator into another.<br />The book is an extremely quick and easy read in pop-psychology genre. The main words of wisdom are to be true to yourself. I was dismayed to see the work fortifying the belief that all human kindness is just a way to manipulate others, and that we need to always question the motivation of others. Sometimes kindness is just kindness.<br />The book tries to label niceness as a disease needing a cure. This makes for a catchy title and a niche in the pop psychology market, but what little wisdom the author has to share is twisted in the works poor logic, I really couldn't give the book more than a two.	2003-01-22

Unfortunately, it is a fruitless game because writing and publishing technology will make even longer books possible in future generations. Sorry Robert, your crown for longest book won't last very long.<br />Robert Jordan spent a little bit more time on character development in this work. Unfortunately, when you have fantasy characters, the character development itself is going to be unreal.<br />Really, what can Mat's love affair tell readers about life? Two people have visions and know they have to marry or the world will end. I am sorry, it really is not as good a vehicle for romance or character development. Political squabbling among witches really doesn't provide much insight on ideas either.<br />Yes, if there are people who can blow up eachother with thoughts, then this might be how they behave. yawn.<br />On the plus side, the work gives hope that there is some movement toward the alliances for the final battle. The book leaves the audience poised for a fast paced action book.<br />Of course, the author might simply want to draw the audience into another couple 700 page treatises on fantasy character politics before we reach the end of the series.	2003-01-21

This book is just such a romp of the imagination, and will be enjoyed by any child who enjoys the enticements of nature.<br />Ms Dewey's book is about having fun with mud. She speaks about the role that mud plays in Native American ceremonies. She recounts her entrepreneurial excursions with medicinal mud, and tells us how people use mud and clay for buildings and art work. The books is full of imagination. For example, she finds fossils of the ever illusive camalope (part camel part antelope) in the mud banks near her home.<br />In Mud Matters, the author invites the reader to get down and dirty, and to explore the very heart and essence of the land: mud.	2002-03-22

The photographers did a fantastic job capturing light, and the pictures are extremely well printed. This would be a great book to have on hand while watching the olympics.<br />It is also a good book for people who want to  have a coffee table book about Utah.<br />The book itself starts with a brief overview of the Salt Lake Bid, and the resulting Olympic bidding scandal. It then takes us on a tour of the geology of Utah and the mountain west. The book includes pictures of both the mountains in Northern Utah, and the Colorado plateau in Southern Utah. It provides a summary of historical and cultural information about the Salt Lake Valley.<br />In the last quarter of the book, we get into sports photography, and we can see some high quality shoots of skiers and other athletes.<br />All in all, it is a well made and designed coffee table book. The main reason to buy it is the high quality photography. You will definitely enjoy having it on hand while you watch the Olympics. The book covers a great deal of information, mainly at a summary level; so it really would not serve as a reference book. <br />Finally, having been written before the Olympics, there are no actual pictures of 2002 Olympic events.  My guess is the book was written before 9/11/2001, and there is no mention of the international tensions which will be in everyone's mind during the events.	2002-01-27

It uses a large font, wide margins. I counted several pages, and found it averaged around 100 words per page, making the book feel like more than it really is.<br />I did not look at the CD. But the description of the CD seems to indicate that it pretty much has the standard fair of freeware suites like Apache, PHP, ... I downloaded the same stuff from NuSphere. NewShpere had a nice installation program that set up my PC, without my having to think.<br />I take it that this book was meant primarily as a reference. The small amount of programming information in the front of the book was decidedly uninformative. I personally found the big red (somewhat terse) Professional PHP book to be a better reference manual.<br />The book really does not succeed as an introduction to programming, nor does it succeed as a PHP tutorial.

The first half is praise for the &quot;cheese&quot; story and tells you how it will change your outlook on everything. The second half is a discussion by friends about how the cheese story was the turning point in their lives. (Both the praise and the discussion dropped several hints about buying the book for everyone you've ever met, and keeping few hundred copies on hand for the people you might meet in the future.)<br />Hey, wait a second, the math doesn't add up...if the first half was a build up and the second half was a discussion...then...<br />Never mind...it does add up.

Mathematicians wanting to know more about gaming or graphic techniques will find the math lacking. There is not enough action to keep game players from yawning. There is no cut and paste code for second rate programmers to plagerize. Only a narrow audience will really find the book of interest.<br />I am really happy to see this book on the shelves. Game programming is a multi-billion dollar industry. Many of the people got their start in the business through graphic arts, or simply banging on computers without much training.  This book shows how programmers need to evolve from just plain code monkeys to true thinkers.<br />It was interesting to see what subjects the author found to be important. He concentrated a great deal on random number generation, seeding, plot development, basic oop and finally he touched on fractals. Unfortunately, the mathematics in the book was pretty much obvious stuff. The book would not serve well as a reference, nor as a text book. <br />If you are in the game programming business, I would recommend this book.

In this work, Mr. Stephenson takes time to muse about the most important development of his generation: the computer operating system. <br />I agree with most of his points on the operating system. I still prefer the command line myself. The command line lets you concentrate on logic, not fluff.<br />The question on your mind is whether or not you should buy the book. Hardcore computer buffs will be disappointed because the book is not hardcore enough. The book really does not impart any new wisdom on OS development. It is just a pile of random thoughts.<br />Many readers in Neal's Sci Fi fan base will simply scratch their head wondering why their favorite author let off a brain fart about operating systems.<br />I am happy that Mr. Stephenson took time to think about this issue, and voice his opinions. However, I wouldn't put it toward the top of a must read list. Yet, if you are in the mood to read opinions about computers and the effects they have on our society...you will find it a short, sweet read.	2002-01-07

Although the author captures the beauty of the subject, the reader may find it hard to use the book for identifying plants.<br />I would put this book at the top of the list for people wanting to get started learning about the native plants in Utah.

Kimball played by Harrison Ford in &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (although this R. Kimball is making out like a bandit with his Data Warehouse series.) This primary goal of this book is to cash in on the outrageous amounts of money poured into the web during the dot com bubble. Ralph Kimball wanted his piece of the action, and has extracted a tremendous pile of loot from the naive dot com companies buying into the webhouse dream.<br />As with a lot of other manifestations of the dot com bubble, the book seems to oversell the technology. &quot;Personalized banner ads&quot; and other expensive ideas have returned pennies on the dollars. Many implementations of the webhouse have proven that there is a point where data warehouse investments no longer have a positive ROI.<br />IMHO Data warehouse technology has its greatest impact in mature companies with mulitple years of data to analyze, and determine trends.  It is not quite fit for young companies that are in the process of self definition.<br />Many failed dot coms poured millions into webhouses that never returned a dime. In some cases, the webhouse diverted resources from the main product, and contributed to the company's fall. <br />All of Kimball's books are well written. They are designed to give insight into both the political and architectural dimensions of a data warehouse project. (Data warehouse projects are generally hot beds of political intrigue. Generally the project is launched by the CEO and MBAs to improve reporting...so the data architect is generally more involved in power politics than the standard IT guy. )<br />I decided to only give this book only three stars because of the unfortunate tendency we all have to over promise. I wanted to temper some of the six star praise. If you are interested in learning about data warehousing, I would start with Immon, and the first DW Toolkit, and not spend any cash on this volume.	2002-01-05

In both cases it appears that Mr. Foster starts out with a great idea...then runs out of steam half way through and flounders about until he reaches his page quota for the publisher.<br />To The Vanishing Point is a book in the grand penny press tradition of &quot;write 'em cheap &amp; write 'em fast.&quot;<br />The books is a good escape from reality tale. The characters are interesting and the writing style is intriguing. Note...the book did not make it into the mass paperback. The work is a little short of compelling. But if you are in the mood to read a plotless book totally detached from the world, you will enjoy getting close to the vanishing point.<br />Don't buy the book, if you are looking for more. I would not put it in a recommendation list.	2001-12-02
US	52993991	R34JR0OGAUXB7K	0812571487	22839239	Secret Passages	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A very interesting book	Preuss does an excelent job developing characters, and bringing us in to the lives and history of the people of isolated island of Crete. <br />When I started the book, I was expecting more physics. I was not prepared for the 100 page biography of Minakis, and did not enjoy the interlude as much as I would have if I was expecting it.<br />The writing style was fantastic. I loved the characters. This book about the lives of scientists. It is a welcome relief to all the quirky sci-fi books filling the bookstore shelves. A previous reviwer made a good point labelling &quot;Secret Passages&quot; as fiction about science instead of science fiction.<br />The characters and writing style are fantastic. Preuss does an excellent job weaving together anthropology, the history of Crete, philosphy and physics. On the downside, many of the transitions in the book were weak and the plot a little disjoint. This was truly a refreshing book, but I gave the book a 4 instead of a 5.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a very deep and thoughtful work on the lives of scientists. I admit, I wish I had a map of Crete at hand while reading it. I expect it would be better on the second read.	2001-08-23

The main redeaming factor of the book is that it is short, and written at a 4th grade level; so you can get through it quickly. I would not recommend the book to a friend, and regret the time I wasted reading it. <br />In some ways, the book gives an more accurate picture of the criminal mind than most thrillers. The bad guys are ordinary people, living their lives, dealing with problems. They spend a great deal of time whining and complaining. The cops often have a good notion in advance about who is doing wrong. But also spend a great deal of their time engaged in bathroom banter.<br />The work fits somewhere between a dumb criminals web page and a second rate fiction novel. There are better books out there.	2001-08-23

It is the sci fi version of the murder on the rez' genre (pioneered by Tony Hillerman.) The book takes place in the not to distance future. The Navajo Indian reservation is now a haven for hi-tech firms (mostly Asian) seeking skilled labor and tax havens.<br />Although the Dineh have pretty much abandonned the ancient superstition...it turns out that there's something funky going on with the sand paintings. The cops in the book get to explore the sand paintings, Navajo culture and computer technology and more.<br />As mentioned in another review. The book is not well written. The characters are weak, and the author never really develops the plot or the symbology in the sand paintings. I really wish the author or editors had taken the time to turn this fantastic idea into a block buster.<br />But if you are willing to overlook the faults, the book is an absolute riot. The concept behind the books is so strong that I give it a five star rating despite the poor writing <br />doo ahashyaa da	2001-08-17

He did a great job of portraying the people caught up in the bond and borrowing industry, and the ethical dilemmas they face. I would heartedly recommend the book.<br />I would put the book on par with Dick Francis and Grisham.	2001-08-01

This book is like a Dick and Jane reader...with bad grammar and a lot of cussing. The book is mainly three and four word sentences like:<br />He look up.<br />Joey look up.<br />It's his sense.<br />The book is doubled spaced! You get the illusion that is a captivating read because it is a 70 page book printed on 300 pages to make it look thick.<br />It really is nothing more than a poorly written short story with bad grammar and graphic language. I liked the review that compared it to a comic book--only comic book writing takes more talent.	2001-04-30

I was dazed and confused by the shiny cover I saw on the discount rack. The shiny cover had Tom Clancy's name; so I threw my dollar down. I understand now why it was on the discount rack. There really wasn't much of a plot. Weight lifters and interoffice romance. Usually, I am happy with my dollar book purchases, but I really couldn't find any reason for this novel.	2001-03-30

The fact that Minnie Mouse plays a prominent role in THE PLAN, is a fairly obvious clue.<br />The book is tortuous and slow which might be the reason people miss the parody. I sympathize with the readers that gave up mid stream. It is not for the weak of heart. Umberto Eco fills page after page with examples of the convoluted reasoning of occultists. <br />I gave the book lower marks because parody wears thin when it is stretched too far.<br />I could not heap enough praise on Eco's earlier novel, The Name of the Rose. I loved the concept of Foulcants Pendulum, but found the book longer and more confusing than the concept merited. I would not recommend it to the casual reader.	1999-10-10
