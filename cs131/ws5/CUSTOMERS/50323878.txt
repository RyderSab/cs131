No, it's not just a story of a couple of wasters who got into drugs and got what they deserved. It is not like that at all. It's a very sad, moving story about a little girl who lived a sad, lonely, frustrating life filled with violent behaviour and loss of control.It's about a girl who wanted to be normal and happy but was never able to find piece of mind as she was mentally ill as a result of an accident at birth.Help was never that easy to find for Nancy but her family tried every means possible to help the child they loved, only to see her disappear down the road of self destruction and death at the young age of 20. Nancy Spungen lived a lifetime in her short years and was never able to find happiness, maybe until she found Sid Vicious.Vicious, regardless of the name, was not as vicious as people would like to believe.I feel that he lived the same sort of life as Nancy and when they met, they were just two of a kind. But lets not forget the life that the rest of Nancys family had while she was busy attacking them, getting into drugs,running away,swinging from one mood to another and getting her brother and sister onto drugs.They too have suffered and we shouldn't forget that.This book is mainly written about Nancy but it IS the story of the whole family who lived life in fear of a young woman whose life spiralled way out of control.Very moving, very sad and very disturbing.	2001-06-28

Well,I am reading this book at the moment and I have to say that there are some strange accounts in here.There are women from all walks of life who fall for men in prison who have murdered and raped and some of the men even boast about it.Still, these women are convinced that their men are innocent (nudge,nudge,wink,wink),and I find myself reading over and over again stories of how these women fall for their 'innocent' partners. This book is interesting purely for the fact that there seem to be so many women falling for these monsters and even leaving their homes and children for these men.I wonder if these women would have so much understanding if it were one of their family that was raped,tortured and killed!     Although this book is interesting,I still feel that we are only getting half of the analysis of these women and that the information is coming only from the author.Not enough background work and the author tends to repeat herself quite often.	2000-12-27

What people have to think about is the fact that this is a hard book to  write,there is so much going on and the story is something out of the  ordinary.   Aphrodite Jones concentrates on including as much fact as she  can to portray the story.In my opinion I feel that readers are getting the  whole story.You can't get to know those involved without reading about them  first.This,I feel is what Ms Jones is trying to do. As for the research,who  knows what research has been done?We aren't the ones doing it.Ms Jones is,  and I get a feeling from reading this book that she tries hard to gather  all the facts and present them to us.Who cares whether a name is spelled  wrong?Facts are still facts.Give this book a break.Are we looking for the  story or judging a spelling test? Come on,be fair. I am not overly enthused  with the character of Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena but then I am here to  review the book,not the people in it.I am happy with the way this book is  written,it was money well spent.Aphrodite Jones is fast becoming one of  favourites as I have read many,many true crime books and her books give out  lots of facts.Come on guys,be fair and judge the book for facts,not for  petty annoyances.	2000-09-15
US	50323878	R29ZRI0DKSSNZ4	0786010630	799488921	Cruel Sacrifice	Books	4	18	20	N	N	Disturbing story	I have just finished this highly disturbing and very graphic book about  the murder of 12 year old Shanda Sharer.  This is a story that will shock  even the most hardened true crime/murder readers. It is the story that  nobody should have to read.I say that because it is a true account of five  young women,one of whom died after being beaten,tortured and finally set on  fire.Nobody likes to imagine that this sort of thing can happen but  sadly,it does and it has.  Too much of the fact that some of these girls  are lesbians seems to give this account a reason for Shandas  death.Yes,there is lesbianism going on,but there is also a deadly  combination of severe child abuse,jealousy,mental illness and hate going on  too.  I do not like what these girls did to Shanda as nobody deserves this  wickedness let alone a 12 year old child,but the sad fact is,is that  Melinda Loveless,Laurie Tackett,Hope Rippey and Toni Lawrence are products  of a dysfunctional way of life.  What happened to Shanda is very  disturbing and highly upsetting and I feel for her family and friends who  no longer have her with them.  I lent this book to a friend of mine who  didn't like the fact that a great portion of this book concentrated on  Loveless and Tackett and not so much on Shanda. I feel that Aphrodite Jones  was right to portray the story this way.If we are to learn anything from  this incident then we need to look not only at the victim but the accused  as well. We need to analize these sorts of people and try to work out why  something like this has happened and go on to try and make sense of it so  that other children never suffer the same fate.  A book written only  about Shanda would have given us only half the story as we would then be  left wondering WHY these girls did what they did and WHO were they.  This  book can be a bit 'tabloidy' but for those truly interested in the whole  story of those that kill and the victims they choose then this book tries  very hard to gather all the facts.  Some of you may disagree but this book  was written to give the facts,not as a tribute to Shanda.I think the author  has done what she set out to do in the best way possible.e facts.

This book is disappointing.I found there to be too much in the way of the  authors opinions and not enough fact to back it up.

Well,y'know,we all have our opinions and jokes about the 'Monica' thing but here goes mine.   I believe that Monica Lewinsky was in love with Bill Clinton but that this type of love was a bit childish.Infatuation is a word  that springs to mind but then again,so does immaturity.   This was not her  only affair with a married man,she had actually done this sort of thing  before.I have no respect for women ( or men) who play the part of the  'other' person and I doubt that the Monica has any self respect either.     Anyone with a shred of decency would walk away from this situation no  matter how hard it seems.But the sad fact is,is that Monica Lewinsky is a  selfish cow that has not only brought scandal to America but has humiliated  Hilary Clinton as well.     The book comes across as fairly well written  but paints a picture of a 'poor lonely waif desparately in love 'with a  married man.    There will always be times when you come into these sort of  situations but the least selfish and decent of us will find the strength to  walk away. Anyone who loves gossip will like this book.Anyone who hates  juvenile women will hate it.Simple.	2000-06-07

I feel that there will be no closure to this story as some people involved in this case are either dead or are keeping quiet for ever.  I have seen the house that these shootings took  place as it seems to have become a bit of a tourist attraction for those in  New Zealand who know and wonder about this case.  I even have a family  member that lived in the area and knew Arthur Alan Thomas when the  shootings occured. It has become a public fascination and one of lifes'  mysteries.David Yallop has taken chances when writing this book as the case  is still mentioned from time to time and the question of who fed nany  Rochelle is still asked.  I found this book fairly hard to read as the  scientific evidence is hard to sift through.You read about more than one  trial here and it can be hard going although to really understand why AA  Thomas was convicted,you must first read the 'evidence'.  I don't know  who shot and killed Harvey and Jeanette Crew or who fed the baby but I feel  that it was NOT Arthur Thomas.Maybe it was the dad (Len Demler) and maybe  the sister Heather is involved and that's who fed the child but I just  don't know for sure.Nobody does.It's why this case is still popular.  David Yallop claims that he has evidence that a 'certain' woman was  involved and he 'knows for sure' that she was in the country.Heather  right?I think so but he cannot come out and say it for legal reasons I  suppose.  The book does show you that stuff ups were made in the  trials.All the evidence about all the guns in the area not being tested is  true.I know,as one of the few rifles not tested belongs to a family member  of mine and he told me that it was offered for testing but the police  couldn't be bothered to come and get it.We still have that gun,I have used  it myself.  Everyone who reads about this case will form their own  opinion and everyones will be different.  This case is fascinating but I  don't know as you will get the full impact by reading this account.The book  is long and heavy going but you can still catch enough of the details to  see where David Yallop is heading.  My advice is that if you start to read  it and you get confused with all the details,then put it away for a couple  of days and then try again.l be different.

This is a shocking insight into the way the  countries involved can lie and cover up something as hugh as this.What  gives the 'powers that be' the right to take young children away from their  families and take them to another country and basically dump them there?     Image a child being taken away and told that their parents were dead or  they were no longer wanted.Few of these children ever saw their families  again.In fact very few of them even knew they still had families  anymore.Masses of these children suffered at the hands of their new  'parents'.Abuse was rife,hard physical labour,backbreaking work for hour  after hour,tiny rations of food and beatings seem to have been common for  thousands of these children.     The author discovers one day by chance of  this appaling situation and the more she researches the case,the more she  finds that it was NOT only a few children but many.We're talking thousands  of youngsters packed off to a strange country and left there.    What will  really make your blood run cold is the fact that the government knew all  along what had happened and still they tried to cover it up!Even when they  knew the game was up they still kept on denying.    Image if this was your  family or you are one of these children we are talking about.Don't you  think you have the right to speak up for yourself?   The author has opened  up a huge can of worms and best of all she has exposed the lies and  coverups of what is likely to be one of the biggest darkest secrets ever  kept,until now.     You may not like this review,it doesn't reach even the  worst of this tragedy but it did happen and for all we know,it may still be  happening. Read for yourself and see what I mean.

This is the only true crime book that I have ever read that actually made me cry.I consider myself  pretty hardened to this type of reading but I felt so sorry for the  children in this family having such an evil,nutcase of a mother.     It's  little wonder that children growing up in the violent and sick environment  that these poor kids had turn out to be killers and develop severe mental  problems.     The thing that gets me,and you hear this all the time,is that  although friends and neigbours and even family members knew that this  mother was a sandwich short of a picnic - nobody tries to help these poor  kids!     This woman was a manipulative sadistic woman so consumed with  jealousy that her daughters were prettier than her that she tortured them  killing two out of three in the end.The worst thing is,is that she enlisted  the help of her own sons to get rid of the bodies!     These children  endured severe beatings,starvation followed by mountains of food fed  forcefully until they were sick and made to eat the vomit,they were  drugged,made to drink enough alcohol until they passed out and eventually  one of the daughters was shot by her own mother while being held in place  by her two brothers because her mother was a lousy shot an didn't want to  miss.     Not only was she shot but as she didn't die,her mother nursed her  back to health.I won't tell you how the bullet was removed as I don't want  to ruin the next set of unimaginable events for you.     This book is not  one of the most well written that I have read but the story makes up for  that.Very sad,Your worst nightmare come true,I only hope that someone does  to the mother what she did to her kids.Makes you gasp.Will stay in your  mind.A must for all true crime readers but not for the faint hearted.	2000-01-08

I first read it about six years ago and have since read it again. It's just as good the second time round. A very shocking story of  sex,brainwashing and sick perversions. Not for the easily disturbed. Very graphic details and very shocking in places. On reading the back  of the book I almost laughed at the idea of someone being held captive  for seven years and being brainwashed into staying. On reading the book  however,you come to realise just how this can happen and how frighteningly  real it was for the poor victim, Colleen Stan. All the way through  I couldn't help but wonder why on earth Colleen's family didn't suss out  that something was going on. I mean, hey, your daughter suddenly goes  missing and when she finally turns up she is like a different person  and totally controlled by two individuals that she normally wouldn't  associate with. Surely someone must have thought that something was up?  Really excellent read. Buy it,don't borrow it as you'll definitely want  to read it again.Comes with quite a few photos too.

I have to agree with others on this one.A wee bit repetitiveand downright boring in some parts.Ann Rule is one of my favourite authors but I was disappointed in this book.This is one of the rare times that I have not finished a book.Better luck next time.	2000-01-06
