US	52688738	R293ONKFX1HRFK	0375411089	718882852	Skinny Dip	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Back On The Boil	I've been a Hiaasen fan since 1987(Skin Tight)and look forward to every new book.  Some are great, some are ok, all are worth owning.  All are worth re-reading to catch the nuances of the book that are missed the first time around, usually because you are so looking forward to seeing what's going to happen next that you read too quickly.  I finished this book in about 4 hours and can't wait to re-read it.  Skinny Dip has all the angles covered, all the things that make Florida, Florida, all the rage of a native who loves and remembers what it was like before the canals and developing started killing it.  After a couple of lackluster books, it's good to see Carl back at his absolute best.	2004-07-27

Just like Into Thin Air, there are people who disagree totally with the conclusions presented.  And just like Into Thin Air, nobody who disagrees is willing to file the lawsuit to prove him wrong.  I wonder if it isn't worth the cost to go to court, or if what he writes just might have more truth in it than is wanted, or if the issue is malice or its absence.  Love him or hate him, Krakauer makes you think.	2003-07-20

One of those books that you wish had waited a couple of years so the authors could comment on whatever will happen to Andy Fastow, Jeff Skilling, Ken Lay, et al.  I lived in Houston during the Enron heyday and know many people who lost everything they had in the collapse.  I found myself unable to detach from the arrogance of the upper management, sometimes including Ms. Watkins, who was part of the problem long before deciding to help with the solution.  It will be interesting to see how it all turns out.	2003-05-30

When you buy a travel narrative by Paul Theroux, you are buying misery, sour grapes, irritation, and depression, and this one certainlly doesn't disappoint.  And having spent a lot of time in chicken busses in the backwoods of Guatemala and El Salvador, it's comforting to know somebody else feels the same way when he's stuck out in the middle of nowhere, not that he (or me for that matter) would rather be anywhere else.  I can't wait to read it again.	2003-05-07

Most of what you hear coming out of Miami and Havana is incredibly biased to whatever it is you support.  I found the author's approach fairly even handed.  I do think she did herself some injustice by inserting opinions as though they were fact, especially in the Elian issue. Her insight into Jorge Mas Canosa was revealing and her balanced approach to the enigma that is Fidel was very good.  I will probably re-read this and enjoy it just as much the second time around.	2003-03-19

So I couldn't wait to get to this one when it came out.  I wasn't disappointed.  He does go on a bit of a political and environmental rant, but you must admit, some of the things he's ranting about are worth a rant.

In that vein, I thought Mr. Horwitz's mate Roger really helped the way the book flowed. I kind of felt the way I feel about Bill Bryson when Katz isn't around, he's funny but he's lacking a certain element.  Call that element trashy if you want to, but it's still an element.  I hope Tony Horwitz writes many more books and I hope Roger is with him every step of the way.	2003-03-19

Bottom line:  He was climbing when he should have been husbanding.  The most telling line in the book: Boukreev didn't stay with the people who paid him to guide them.  When he did make his way up to the South Col, he only bothered to save the ones in his expedition.	2003-01-21

In \\"Into Thin Air\\" Jon Krakauer points a pretty strong finger at Boukreev for not performing the duties a guide is paid to perform (such as staying with the people who paid for you to be there.) Mr's. Boukreev and DeWalt point a pretty strong finger back and suggest that Mr. Krakauer didn't do much to help either.  Good point, until you remember that Mr. Krakauer wasn't hired to be the resident expert on all things climbing.  That was Mr. Boukreev's job.  Mr. Krakauer (or Outside Magazine) paid to be on Everest (bartered space in the magazine for the publicity.)  Mr. Boukreev was paid, quite handsomely, to provide expertise and safety to the climbers.  The assertion that \\"Scott Fischer knew and agreed that I would go down ahead of everybody and drink tea\\" cannot be verified, but seems to be somewhat situation ethical.  The fact that Mr. Boukreev made it back up to the South Col to rescue a couple of people is heroic in nature.  The fact that he rescued only the ones from his crew and left two from the Rob Hall crew to die is almost criminal.  However, I suppose the most scorn I feel is for Mr. DeWalt, who saw his cash cow and rode him until he died, and then was never heard from again. Shame on you Weston. When you couldn't hide behind Anatoli, poof, you were gone.  Pathetic ... really	2003-01-21

A compelling dialogue between the two Dr's Ryan.  Gruff Admiral Greer and steely Yuri Andropov.  You know, I actually put this book down in the middle of it (about the time Ed and Mary Pat's hand communications were going full bore) and read three old Forsyth novels, The Negotiator, The Fist of God, and The Deceiver.)  I was begging to have a mole at Century House.  I was crying to have one of the people around the Ryan's, whether it was the colleague, the Taxi Driver, or even the nanny, leave a note at a drop box and make a chalk mark on the wall.

His portrayal of the Federal System is right on the target.  Several years ago I was selected to sit on a Federal Grand Jury and came away from that experience with a profound distrust of the feds.  Over and over again, in that jury room, we were subjected to lies, misrepresentations (one DEA agent even came in the room, gave evidence, and only upon questioning from those in the room did it come out that he was no where near the incident he just described in such vivid detail.  The statute of limitations was about to run out and he was told to read the file and act like he was the arresting officer)and deception.  We had a diet of this for 18 months and all of us agreed that these guys can't be trusted.  This book bears that out and brought back a ton of memories.  If you get in trouble, never trust what they tell you they're going to do if you cooperate, and always get your deal in writing before you talk.	2002-07-10

For me, the background was good, but the reading on the France '98 team is essential to anybody who cares about US Soccer.  John Harkes is owed an apology by Steve Sampson and the powers that be at US Soccer for the way he was treated after giving it all up for the glory of the game in the USA.  Sampson may dispute the facts put down by Harkes, but the book got published, Harkes never got sued, Harkes is still playing and Sampson is coaching kids soccer (right where he belongs.)  Attitude?  Dang right.  Too many people, like John Harkes, Marcelo Balboa, Alexi Lalas et.al. poured their lives in elevating the game to an unheard of level in the states, only to be lied to, whispered about, and then ultimately begged by the boss, himself, Judas Sampson, to \\"take it easy on him, he's only a human being.\\"  Calling himself a human being is a slap in the face to the genus as a whole.	2002-03-07

His ability to describe the misery of a trip is classic. When it comes to fiction I am convinced Paul Theroux should stick to travel narratives.  As good as he is on a train, he stinks in a fictional setting.  I expected the novelist Theroux in Sir Vidius's Shadow.  I got the travel essayist.  Who cares about sour grapes.  That's life.  Sour grapes put into words is something to be savored.  Whereas I have read The Great Railway Bazaar et.al many times.
