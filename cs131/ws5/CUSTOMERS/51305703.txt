I had no idea of the content of this book when I picked it up at a Used Book Store. In fact, I looked at it several times before starting to read and then had great difficulty putting it down. My own Mother died in an instant from a heart<br /><br />attack. I always felt cheated that I didn't get to say \\"Good-bye\\" but after reading<br /><br />this book, I know how fortunate we were not to go thru the heartbreak of an<br /><br />illness like this........so much pain and suffering, both physical and mental for the patient as well as the family.<br /><br />I will now look for all of Quindlen's books hoping they are as interesting and<br /><br />completely \\"full of life\\" as this one.	2005-10-03

Before reviewing this book, I read what others had to say and I concur with many of them. Book was much too long and confusing. Too many characters. <br />I had great difficulty trying to remember who did what to who, etc. Very little <br />relevance throughout the book to what happened at the end. Think perhaps  <br />Ms Clark is trying to write too many books and with the length of this one, <br />one could assume she is selling her books by the pound.

I WAS SO SORRY TO SEE IT END!!!! I believe it is one of the best books I have read in my long life time. I didn't want to do anything else<br /><br />but read but hated the fact it would com to an end. This one deserves a sequel<br /><br />so that we can know what happened as these people's lives went on. SUCH GOOD PEOPLE and so very interesting. We need more books 'with good or happy endings' in our lives. It is true there need not be any violence and really<br /><br />bad people in order to make the story most interesting.

When are they going to let the kids know they are NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE TO TROD THE EARTH.<br /><br />So due to the stupidity of the parents, THEIR CHRISTMAS IN THE ISLANDS WAS<br /><br />RUINED and most likely the brat didn't marry her true love of one month.

Just finished reading it and like another &quot;reviewer&quot; I would read for awhile, put it down and determine I COULD not finish it. I grew up in a time when money and jobs were REALLY scarce so I wonder about these people who are so very poor. Know there are many like them but do they have to be, with all that is available out there. I guess my thinking is Grisham's book would have been more realistic had it been written about &quot;The Big Depression Era&quot; rather than a time when there were jobs and help available. I am not in great sympathy with the &quot;poor me&quot; syndrome which seems so prevalent in this great nation, and this book seems to almost &quot;glorify&quot; the people who are really ne'er do wells.

Having almost become a resident of Santa Barbara I almost know where the house is. I thoroughly enjoy Petra and hope she will appear again in  another book -- maybe as a partner to Delaware. Think Stu is a bit too  reticent to be her partner. One suggestion to Kellerman -- we really don't  need all the vulgar language to enjoy your wonderful stories, but if you  feel it is necessary to get your point across will still read everything  you write. .	2000-01-14

There is a person in my family similar to the main character and I have watched in horror what she has done to some of her children.Ms Siddons is able to make one feel they are living with all the  characters--unable to help as the main character is so strong. I thoroughly  enjoyed Foxes Earth and was sorry to see it end.	2000-01-10

Was fascinated and horrified with &quot;Ruth&quot;. In her  early years one has profound pity and sorrow for her but as she grew older  was hard to believe one person could cause so much pain for others when she  had lived thru so much of itherself. Thought it a bit slow at times but  now, as I have only ten pages left to read, wish it could go on and on.Glad  I have read it as now will continue reading more of Siddons books.	1999-12-14

I am still reading this book and enjoy it more every time I turn a page. Her characters seem true to life and not the &quot;make believe&quot; people in so many modern books. The fact that she can make you feel a part  of her books is, to my way of thinking,  the mark of a truly good writer. I  have read every book she has written and consider her right up there with  Rosamunde Pilcher -- another of my favorites.	1999-11-25

I can hardly believe I finished reading this book as every page was more stupid than the previous one. I am not a regular reader of Danielle Steel but read them when given to me. If the author has future ideas of writing  more of this kind I will not bother to read them even though they are free.  A complete waste of time and energy.	1999-11-08

Normally her characters have character but  these people were all shallow, unthinking dilletantes. However I am an  older person and perhaps should listen to my nieces and their children when  they keep insisting-- this is the nineties.	1999-11-02
