I am not going to go into the plot of this book, the other reviewers and synopsis writers have done all that. I am just writing to tell the other readers this is a great book. Every time I pick up a new Michael Connelly book, I think he can't possibly top the last one. But he does....this is one great book. It was a little slow to start, but it gives the reader a chance to really get to know the main character, and then it just takes off, the book is so hard to put down. Read it, enjoy it, and hope we will see this new Connelly character again.	2005-10-13

I have to admit, I felt a little funny even thinking of buying it, because it is listed and shelved as a young adult book. Well, I decided to \\"bite\\" the bullet, and I purchased it, curled up with it over a weekend, and could not put it down. Don't let the fact that you have to visit a different section of the book store stop you from reading it, (or of course, purchase it on Amazon, no one will ever know if you don't want them too). This is a really great book with real emotions all wrapped up in a vampire story, a young woman's story of having to grow up faster then she maybe should have because of her parents, and yet still dealing with all the issues that growing up brings with it. All in all, a great book, glad I decided to overlook the age description.	2005-09-30

I thought it was a wonderfully written book, exprssive, complete, and I enjoyed every minute of it. It is a suspenseful, gothic like, ghost story, with characters I fell in love with, and some that really scared me! It wasn't exactly new territory, the premise of the book, but it didn't matter, I was so caught up in it, I had to sit and read it until I was done. I look forward to more work from Ms. Schilling, as a matter of fact, I just ordered her previous book from Amazon. Can't wait until it comes!	2005-09-25

I had read some early press about this book and I couldn't wait to read it. I LOVED it! This book grabbed me and would not let go. I devoured it, ignoring everything else until I could finish it.  <br />If you are looking for a typical horror book, don't pick this book up. It is different, a quiet, suspenseful, beautifully written book. I can't imagine the research that was needed to write this wonderful book, and I found all the details fascinating. I was hooked from the beginning. And I was involved...in the characters, in the story, in the history, just sitting and reading constantly as the stories within the stories unfolded. <br />Thank you Ms. Kostova for an enjoyable few days. I highly recommend this book.	2005-06-27

I really liked the characters, the likeable ones and even not so likeable ones. The author was honest, and the book kept me reading. I was curious to find out where it was all going. Still, I just never felt there was any \\" there-there\\". In other words, I read it, it was okay, didn't love it and wished I had waited for the paper.	2005-06-05

I have to admit I was attracted to the description of the book that said the character was a shopaholic that still shopped in the face of danger. Light, right? <br />The book ended up being pretty silly, not very suspenseful, a liitle too light. It may be good for a vacation read where you find you will not be able to concentrate at all, and just need something to fill time on a beach or by the pool. Something with alot of fluff and not much substance. Too much like the bodice rippers I read in my late teens and early twenties with a modern twist. Not my cup of tea anymore.	2005-06-05

Of course it could just be that I was so glad to be visiting these families again. <br />I won't go into the details of the story, the Amazon description does that quite well, but if you liked Julie and Romeo, you won't want to miss this one.

Of course, there is alot more than meets the eye.  <br />I really liked this book, I am such a fan of Mr. Rosenfelt's and this book meets all my expectations. I had some laughs and even a few tears. There were some twists and turns in the story that I didn't see coming, and trying to figure out the story around the murder, kept me racing to the end.

I won't go into details of the plot, amazon and the other reviewers have done that already, but I just want fans of Ms. Mitchard's Deep End of the Ocean to give this one a try. I have not loved all of her other books since Deep End, so I wasn't sure about reading this one but the other Amazon reviews sparked my interest.  <br />The writing was honest and real, the characters had their flaws and blemishes, just like real people. Most of the time, a book about a woman who gets dumped, has children and has an illness, is made out to be a saint, an angel, a hero. Well, not here. She is real....As I got to the end, I was concerned about the way the story was going, everything tied up with a bow, nice and neat, I was afraid Ms. Mitchard was giving into happy ever after land...but she didn't. Even the ending was like real life, not perfect. <br />Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down, give it a try, I think you will be glad you did.	2005-04-21

I didn't think I would like it, but once I started it, I got so involved and could not put it down. <br />I remember reading The  Diary of Anne Frank a few times when I was a teenager, and I used to imagine the premise of this book...what if Peter had survived, or Anne or her sister...what would they be like and what would they be doing now. So when I saw this book I thought, juvenile, I wrote this book in my mind years ago. My apologies to the author! This book is so far removed from a young persons teenage fanatasies...... I am so glad I picked it up. <br />I won't go into the premise of the book, Amazon does that quite well, but I will tell you I was enthralled with the character of Peter, his guilt, his pain, his anger and his fear. I think Ms. Feldman wrote a beautiful book, one that should not be missed. <br />	2005-04-18

Major General Shachnow is an amazing man, led an amazing life with courage and strength above and beyond most people. The stories of his childhood are heart- wrenching and yet they show the beginnings of this boy's growth into the man he became. <br />The only complaint I have about the book is that some of the recollections seemed to be cut short, I would just be getting into a story, wanting to know more, and the author was on the way to something else! I sometimes wonder how people survive the many hardships they have in their life, and Major General Shachnow had his share of hardships plus some. And of course, his joys and happy times as well. They are all told in this book with honesty, humor and matter of fact humility. <br />This book was a gift, and I'm grateful that someone gave it too me, I had not seen it in the stores. Read this book, even it you don't normally read memoirs or non-fiction, it is well worth it.	2005-04-17

I just finished reading this book and I'm still not quite sure whether it deserves a 3 or 4 star rating. I rushed through, turning pages because I wanted to see what happened. I liked the characters and I thought on a whole, the premise of the book was a great thrill ride. <br />Now, here is what I found wrong with it. I felt it ended too quickly without a good explanation of what and who was involved, and I just found the converstions, the situations, a little too \\"scripted\\". I know, it is a book, a novel, but do people really talk like these people talked? Maybe....who knows...it just felt forced in so many places.  <br />Again, I am really on the fence but on the whole I liked the story, and I would pick up another book by this author.	2005-04-05

This is more than a book with a story, it is an experience.   <br />When I write my reviews I never describe the plot of the book, because Amazon does it very well, and of course other people do it in their reviews....so no need. <br />Well, even if I wanted to describe this book I couldn't. So again, I will just tell you why I loved it. <br />Mr. Foer is a wonderful writer. I had not read his first book yet, although I will do that now, but something in the description of this book caught my eye, so I tried it.  <br />I laughed and cried and even when I was laughing, I was profoundly sad. I loved the characters and their flaws, their fears, their stories, their realistic humanity even among such unrealistic situations. I just can't describe how much I loved this book or why, but it has been put on my shelf of favorite books, to be read and reread, or experienced and experienced again. Again, it made me so sad and yet, when I was done, the sadness was mixed with such wonder and even hope. Mr. Foer, you are a marvel, to the readers, don't miss this one.	2005-03-16

My husband wanted to take it away from me when something happened and I sat on the sofa and just cried and cried. Ms. Picoult never fails to pull emotions from me, and she does it again with this book. I also like that not everything was tied up nice and neat, there was room at the end for the reader to wonder where the characters will go. I liked that, it made it realistic.

I was so involved with these characters, I would think about them when I was away from the book, and yes, it was depressing, but well worth the read.

I had to agree. This book just proves it all over again. The only reason I gave it four instead of five, is the author told some stories twice and I think once, even a third time. I was surprised at that, but all in all, a great book. <br />Those obsessed orchid collectors? Who knew? <br />This book is a very, very , interesting and fun read.

Sorry Mr. Smith, I don't normally like to write bad reviews, but I just couldn't let this one go by without a word of warning to everyone who likes the other series.	2004-10-04

I saw this book at the bookstore and after glancing through it, I knew I had to take it home. What a funny, fuuny book. Oh....... and very informative. I can't imagine anyone actually trying to read the whole encyclopedia, from A to Z. How boring, how daunting, how strange. But oh, how glad I am this author took on this task. Funny, funny book. I found myself laughing out loud more times than I can count, and I kept wanting to share the entries as I was reading them, not just for the extra laughs, but for the really interesting tidbits the author chose to tell. Since I was alone in the house most of the time I was reading, and couldn't share anything I was reading, I went to Amazon and ordered a couple of copies for other people. I shouldn't be the only one to enjoy this book. Read this book and give one as a gift to someone you know. Well worth it.	2004-09-22

I will tell you that The Shadow of the Wind is one of the best books I have ever read. I read a lot of books, sometimes 2 to 3 a week, so when I say it is one of the best I have ever read, it is really saying something. I had already told someone they could borrow it when I was finished, now I am sitting here trying to figure out how to back out of that promise, I don't want it leaving my hands!!!<br />So do what I did, read this book quickly because once you start, you will have no choice. Then go back and start over, read it slowly and enjoy the writing, the story and the total experience. Bravo Mr. Carlos Ruiz Zafon.	2004-07-15

I have read all of Mr. Rosenfelt's books and I must say he has become one of my favorite authors. I was in the process of moving when this book came out, so I had to wait to read it, and it was well worth the wait. I thought I had the story figured out, a couple of times, but I was wrong both times. I also must say, I spend a lot of time laughing out loud when I read Mr. Rosenfelt's books.

Tracy	I recently read the first novel in this series, Monkeewrench, and was thrilled to see this new book, by the great mother-daughter writing team. I adore the characters and couldn't wait to get involved with another story that involved them.<BR>I am not going to explain the plot, Amazon always does that, but I will tell you I couldn't figure out who did what and why, until the authors wanted me too, and it made for a great ride. Really interesting premise....and I am again looking forward to the next book in this series. I think the author was setting up a situation that will bring some of the characters from the first book that were not around much in this one, back, and I can't wait. Read this book, but read Monkeewrench first if you havn't read it. It is out in paper and well worth the read, plus it will really help to know the background.	2004-05-13

So just my review...<BR>I am a huge fan of Ms. Siddons', I have been reading her books from the first. She is the type of author that you take her book and not just read it, but wrap it around you, and you become a part of her story. This book was no exception. I really liked the characters. Of course the setting, as in so many of her books, was another character.<BR>I gave it four, (really wanted to give it four and a half), instead of five only because of the ending. Something happens at the end,that I think needed a little more story. I felt like maybe her editor told her to hurry up. Overall though, a really good read, and well worth the time.	2004-04-13

I am a huge fan of Ms. Kinsella's Shopaholic series, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of this. I made my husband drive me to a bookstore while were on vacation, so I could get this book the day it came out. I have to admit, if I wasn't an insomniac, I may not have finished it, but it is an easy read, so I was able to polish it off in a couple of nights. Now, for the part about why I didn't like it. This kind of book is not deep, so I wasn't expecting that, however, I was hoping to connect with the character, or even the story, and I didn't do either. Sort of amusing, and I'm sorry to say, sort of boring. Sorry Ms. Kinsella! If you havn't rushed out to buy this, borrow a copy or wait for paper. This book won't stop me trying her next one, but I just didn't think it was up to the Shopoholic books. Next time!	2004-04-11

I was surprised at all the mixed reviews I read on Amazon as well as some papers and magazines. I thought this was one of Mr. Grisham's best. I have to admit, for you skeptics out there, I have always been a fan of Mr. Grisham's, but I have felt his last few books have not lived up to my expectations. I think this one is WONDERFUL. I think Mr. Grisham is just a great storyteller, and this was one great story. The charcters were believable and interesting, and the story itself grabbed my interest and would not let go. I for one am thrilled to have a Grisham book that rates up there with A Time to Kill, The Firm,and Pelican Brief. This book will join my stack of Grisham's that I like to reread, just for the enjoyment of a good story.	2004-04-04

I also noticed some pretty good reviews.I was very surprised at how much I didn't like it. I couldn't even get through the whole book. The writing was immature and shallow, and very repetitive. Maybe I am too old for the type of book, although I do like some of the new &quot;chick lit&quot;. I am going to send it to someone else, and let her try it, maybe it was just me.Anyway, if you are reading this review, maybe you should try to get a copy from the library, or borrow one, or even wait for paper.

Watching someone you love fight cancer is never pretty, but this is a wonderful book. The characters were real, honestly portrayed people, with warts and all. Yet I loved these characters, and found myself laughing and crying along with them all.<BR>The author, Ms. Robinson, is an excellent writer and was able to say so much without a lot of unnecessary words, and was able to stir up emotions, good and bad, with each turn of the page, or the next letter.<BR>This is well worth the read, don't miss it.	2004-01-26

I am a passionate reader, and although this book was very entertaining, I have to admit I felt like Ms. Nelson felt that I was a reader a little beneath others, because I am one of the readers who read mostly fiction, and mostly \\"best seller\\" fiction. I love writers who continue characters, I love mysteries and books that she considers \\"men's books\\", like Tom Clancy. I still look forward to Robert Ludlum,because I just can't let go....In other words, I am the book reader and buyer who goes to the book store, or orders from Amazon, and gobbles up the books which a some people consider junk! <BR>But that said, I did identify with Ms. Nelson's love of books. I have a book with me all the time and I keep a copy of something, (normally Jane Austen) in the car in case I forget to bring what I am reading at the time. I go through at least 2 books a week, sometime more, I read the reviews on Amazon ( I don't always go by what they say, but I read them!), and I read every book magazine and newspaper book section I can get my hands on. I have hundreds of books I have not read, and hundreds and hundreds more that I have. My husband has to beg me at times to please give some away, we have no more room.<BR>So, I too have too many books,and never enough time. But I do want to thank Ms. Nelson for a couple of things. I have started (after turning 45) allowing myself to put down books I don't like. I used to feel the need, ( I guess since I paid for it) to finish it no matter what. I have now decided life is too short. Ms. Nelson reinforced this for me, and has helped with the guilt that still sneaks in once in a while. And second...I have a confession. I too look ahead sometimes. I particularly liked her friend who explained it this way....I look ahead on something I really like, just so I can relax and enjoy the journey. (Those were not her words, but the sentiment). Also, I like the reader friend who reads the end of mysteries first, since he doesn't really like suspense! Anyway I have always thought I was the only one who did that, and I never have been able to confess it! Thank you for bringing my deep secret into the light!<BR>So, read this book, I would have given it a five star, if only I didn't feel as if Ms. Nelson and her publishing friends want to sell me their client's books, but don't respect me as a reader!	2003-10-27

But something about this one grabbed me even more than his first, and I read it without putting it down, I was so involved with Daniel,the main character, and his life.<BR>I have to admit, at first I felt a little guilty laughing at the main character's behaviors, but then I decided I wasn't laughing at him, kind of with him. I started thinking about the things I do that are strange, (I won't go into them here, anybody that knows me, feel free to ask, I'll explain), and realised I am just lucky any strange behaviors on my part have not been the kind to interfere with my leading what some people call a &quot;normal&quot;life. Then after I got over my guilt, I allowed myself to laugh at everything I found funny, which was a good thing, I laughed out loud quite a lot.I also had a couple of places with some tears. So what I am trying to say is, read this book and enjoy. I will probably read it again one day, just because I enjoyed it so much, and I am finding that I really miss Daniel.	2003-10-07

So...maybe it is me and not the book, maybe there is way more to this book and the characters that I just didn't get....<BR>anyway, I try not to write reviews on books that I can't give at least a four too, but I was just so confused at the end of the book, wondering, what did I miss?

I never really cared what happened to anyone, and I just kept reading to see how the plot would be resolved.

It showed on every page,in every story. I enjoyed the gossipy tidbits, and the insights that Ms. Hepburn allowed the reader to see into her own life and feelings.

Then of course, I remember I am a spoiled American through and through and wouldn't give my life up for anything, but it is a fun fantasy.

I'm not sure how I found her, just something about the premise of Julie and Romeo struck a cord, so I read it and enjoyed it so much. Well, then I read her second novel and enjoyed it also, so I was thrilled when this showed up on my amazon recommendations. I curled up with this book and read it in one day, with very few interruptions, and I was so involved with the characters, that by the end of the book, I felt as if I knew them. This is a fun, hopeful read and had some lines in it that I quoted out loud to the family, much to their dismay, since I then had to explain who everyone was and what was going on.<BR>Anyway, read this book when you need a warm, lovely diversion from your life. The main character sees herself in cakes to relieve stress, I used this author's book as my therapy. Thank you Ms. Ray.	2003-06-01

I knew as soon as I finished it, it would be one of those books that I put on my &quot;special shelf&quot; to be read again at a later date. I don't want to give to much away, but when I first picked it up, I sort of thought there would be a mystery, &quot;where is her husband?&quot;Then of course, I realised that wasn't the mystery at all. The mystery was, did the wife want him to come back?  I picked this book up because it was a backup for my vacation book which I left at home. I was thrilled when I started reading it and found so much more to the stories and characters than I was expecting. Ms. Solomon is a beautiful and witty writer. Well worth the time spent with this book.	2003-05-31

Besides the fact that I laughed out loud all through the book at Andy Carpenter, the main character, I found myself tearing through the book to see who did it, and why. I had ideas about who was connected, but couldn't  put the whole thing together right away. So....read this book, it is a laugh and joy, and a good mystery.I don't think I'll wait for paper on Mr. Rosenfelt's next book!	2003-05-18

First of all to anyone out there who complains that I only give good reviews.....I try not to review the ones I didn't like...you know that old saying if you can't say something nice then don't say anything at all.If I have reviewed a book, it means I loved it. I read 2 to 3 books and week and don't review them all, so if you check my other reviews, you now know why I have so many &quot;5 stars&quot;<BR>Now, for this book. I couldn't put it down. I drove my husband crazy becasue i kept saying &quot;oy vey&quot; out loud, and of course he kept saying what's wrong? I would say very shortly &quot;this book&quot;...he would then ignore me...it took about half the book before he finally quit asking! Anyway, if you are already a Harlan Coben fan, you will enjoy this. If you are new to him, read it enjoy it and make sure you read his others! Can't wait for the next one!	2003-05-04

So...I bought this book and I loved it! Mr. Maillard writes in a way that wraps his words and characters totally around me, I get so involved, and he makes me feel the feelings that the characters are feeling, or at least understand them. After reading Gloria I have wondered why Mr. Maillard is not more known, not on reading group lists......anyway, he is a great rider, pick this book up and enjoy the ride.	2003-04-09

But I am going to make an exception here, because my sister insisted. So here goes.....This was an &quot;okay&quot; book. Very fast reading, a good story, but just does not quite make it as a &quot;good&quot;book. I would  not call it a historical novel, although that is what it is described as, I never really felt like I was reading a story from another time period. The story could have been placed anywhere in time and be told the same way. The setting didn't add anything to it. I heard Mr. Patterson talking about all the research he had done, and I don't feel like the reader benefits from that at all!<BR>So, read it, maybe from the library, or a friend's copy, maybe even wait for paper.	2003-03-20

I was first attracted to the book because of the premise, two different people, from two different times in history, writing letters to each other, finding this way to express their fears, doubts, and pleasures of life. (Don't worry, this is not science fiction, the letters were a &quot;literary&quot; tool.<BR>I found myself so involved with the people and characters in this book, I thought about them when I was away, looking forward to picking the book back up.I must admit, about half way through, I slowed myself down as I was reading. I am a pretty fast reader, and I find with books and authors I love, I have to force myself to slow down, and make the experience last longer. This is one of those books.<BR>I really can't find the words to explain what it was about this book that touched me so much, or kept me so involved, but Mr. Bausch, thanks for the experience that I had with this book.	2003-01-30

I look so forward to Mr. Haig's books and I was not disappointed. I love the Sean Drummond character, not only his great sense of humor, but the fact that he makes mistakes, has vulnerabilities just like the rest of us. I think Mr.Haig is up there with Ludlum, Forsyth and Demille, which as far as I'm concerned is really good company. I will be reading his next one too.

I happen to be a big vampire story fan but I have a hard time finding vampire stories I like. Since I am a big Laurell Hamilton fan, you can guess the type of stories I prefer. Well, I am not sure how, but something on Amaaon directed me to this author, and I LOVE her. The story was fun, interesting, new twist on the vampire lore and all around a good mystery. I kept going back and forth with my suspects, and although the culprit turned out to be someone I had on my list, I really enjoyed the journey. I have just started the next book in this series, but I am sure I will enjoy it, and look forward to more Sookie books.	2003-01-13

I started this book and could not put it down until I had finished it. The story and the main character grabbed me from the first, and I found myself racing through the story to not only see the end, but see if my guesses were right. Well, on some I was right, on others, not! Still, I really enjoyed this book and applaud Ms. Hellmann from taking me away from this holiday cooking and shopping madness. I look forward to her next one.	2002-12-22

So...I bought it to read before I read Area 7, and I LOVED it. It is exciting, fast, hard to put down,and a must read. I look so forward to reading Area 7, and have already preordered Mr. Reilly's book called Contest. What a fun, exciting author, I'm suprised he is not more well known. Read this book, read his others, and enjoy!	2002-12-08

Well, if I could have I would have given this book 4 and half, and I wanted to take a half away for two really shallow reasons. Although I really enjoyed this book, it's fast, can't put down reading, I really had no idea what Mr. Crichton was talking about most of the time!!!!I kept asking my husband questions concerning the science in this book, and well, that aside, I really enjoyed it. The second shallow reason I took a half away, was the ending. I wanted about 2 or 3 more pages, things wrapped a little more......but that's just me, because I normally like my endings like that. So...read this book, you will enjoy it.	2002-12-06

So...I put down what I was reading (actually I was rereading Pride and Prejudice) and eagerly attacked this new John Case novel. I was not disappointed.<BR>The technology is a little involved in this book, so I'll just let you read the Amazon[.com] description of this book and just give you my critique! Exciting story, fast read because you want to know what happens next, and if this is your first John Case book, keep in mind that this is not his best. Great book, but not his best! Read this one, but definitely read his others too.<BR>I do have two complaints to Mr. Case. First of all, although I really liked your main character, how naive can one be? You know, that old saying, if it looks to good to be true, it is...? And second of all, Mr. Case, MSNBC is news, not fincance. The fincance station as we all know is CNBC, so that was a glaring error in the flow of the story.......but, I loved the book anyway!	2002-12-03

I can't wait for the next (ha ha) installment in this wonderful, what I hope to be, series of books. As a matter of fact, I have already pre-ordered from Amazon, because I didn't want to take a chance on missing the next one that is scheduled for release in April 2003! <BR>Mr. Fforde, you are a wonder.	2002-11-23

I have to admit that I don't play chess, and I spent a lot of time asking my husband the math major and chess player what things meant and how they connected...but even if I didn't have him handy, I would have enjoyed this book. Well, enjoyed is such a mild description..I love this book, I can't wait to read the sequel.	2002-11-18

I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked it up, and then I just couldn't put it down. I was reading passages to my husband and although he hates it when I do that, I couldn't resist. When I finished it, I went to the Amazon web page and ordered a copy for my son and my sister-in-law. I then put the book on my shelves that I have reserved for the books to read again. As a matter of fact, I have the paperback edition, I think I am going to need the hardback!<BR>This book should be put on reading lists at high schools and colleges, it is that good.  The discussions it could start, the ideas and thoughts it could open to so many people...enough, just take my word for it, this is a MUST read book.<BR>By the way, I found that I needed a dictionary for the book and towards the end, I found it was much easier to read the letters out loud (not to my husband, just for me).Reading the letters out loud helped me understand them, so keep that in mind. What a fun, important book!	2002-10-15

I don't where to begin, or how to begin, to describe the feelings I have for this book. What an experience to read this book. I found myself slowing down when I came near the end, I knew I wouldn't be ready to let go. I found myself stopping after chapters and thinking about Kevin, then going back and rereading that same chapter, just to enjoy the poetry of the author's words and to revisit the place where Kevin was. I don't think I am expressing myself very well, but I havn't been touched by a book this much in a very long time, and I am not only looking forward to this author's next book, but I know I will be rereading this one.

I have to say, I was really looking forward to reading this book when I spotted it at the book store. I had enjoyed Mr.Haig's other book, and I was hoping that this one would not disappoint.<BR>Well, it didn't! I ignored my housework for two days,and read, read, read. Major Drummond, in his return, is just as entertaining and exciting as in his first outing, although I was glad to see he had some &quot;personal growth&quot; in this outing.

There was just something that grabbed me right away, and I read the book in a couple of days, I didn't want to put it down. I really liked the characters, and I got so involved with them.

I normally like her books, I like the characters in the law firm that Ms. Scottoline writes about, and I normally like the stories. This book, however, was silly, very silly, and very hard to get through. Hard really to explain, just not a good addition to the Lisa Scottoline library.I felt like it was rushed and the characters were portrayed as silly and shallow. Not like themselves at all. It won't stop me from reading her next ones, but I might wait for other reviews or paper before I rush out to purchase it! So...Ms. Scottoline, if you are out there, try again, and any new readers to Ms. Scottoline, try her others before you read this one, I'm afraid this one will discourage you from reading her others, and I hate for that to happen.	2002-05-30

I was supposed to be packing for a trip, but I found myself just sitting and reading, and reading. I loved this family, warts and all, I wanted to introduce George to one of my nieces, and I wanted to take tap dancing lessons, even though I cannot dance at all, and I mean any kind of dancing! I just wanted to feel the joy the author was describing. I love watching old Gene Kelly movies, well all the old dance and song movies, and I was envious I could not ever really feel the joy you get from the actual dancing, not just the watching. This was a funny book, warm and sentimental book, and a hopeful book. This is a book I would buy as a gift for a friend, what better compliment is there,than that!	2002-05-14

I have so many questions and conflictiing feelings about that time in our history, but Mr. Delmille took me on a ride that I am so glad I went on. I still have questions and doubts, but I feel so much more open now to explore them. And of course, it is just a really suspensful, exciting read.

But, I felt compelled. <BR>I read the whole book only for one reason, and that was the &quot;device&quot; the author used to tell her story. I am a passionate fan of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, so the parallels with that book kept me reading this book. However, if you are not a fan, I can't think of any reason to read this book. I never felt conncected with anyone, and can't say I even liked anyone very much. I had a few chuckles over her character comparisons with the origionals of Ms. Austen's, but otherwise, not much there.	2002-03-22

It is a great story, something exciting going on chapter to chapter. I have never read any of Mr.Coben's books before, but this one had such great reviews,  I thought I would try it. Well, I loved it. I have spent all afternoon reading it,ignoring my housework, the phone and the doorbell.(Thank goodness for caller I.D.!)<BR>Anyway, if you want an exciting thrill ride, read this book, although I do have one small complaint. At the end there is something that I think needed a little more explanation. But it doesn't really take anything away from the book as a whole, so enjoy!	2002-03-13

For some reason, I coudn't review on the book page, so I am writing my reveiw for the cassette page, I have not heard the cassette, so if you are looking for a review for that, skip this one. However, if you are looking for a book review, this is the place!<BR>I really enjoyed this book, I laughed and cried and screamed in frustration. I also spent time with my mouth dropping open in disbelief. I have read that in the \\"nanny\\" world,there has been some controversy and second guessing as to who this book is about, but I get the impression, it is about a whole lot of people!<BR>What a life these people live, how empty, and how grateful I am that I raised my son without the use of a nanny, just babysitters once every few months! I quit my job when he was about 16 months, and we struggled but now that he has gone to college, I know it was worth every minute. Actually, I knew a few people in my small world that had nannies, but I think they were just these character \\"wannabes\\".<BR>So read this book, enjoy it , relish in the absurdness that some people choose to live their lives, and maybe someone can tell me one day, what IS lavendar water?	2002-03-12

I was intrigued and fascinated by her life, by her family's life, and the life of the community that surrounded her growing up. The author wrote with such passion and her style of writing was so perfect, I found myself reading some paragraphs or pages twice before I moved on, just to enjoy the beauty of her writing.<BR>Even though it is really none of my business, I really wished the author had gone more into how she made the break from the life she was living, what gave her the courage, and I also want to know how her life is now. Again, maybe it is not my business, but I wasn't ready to let her go when the book ended.<BR>I think any &quot;city&quot; person, interested in a life far removed from their own, would enjoy this book, and anyone else interested in book that you can wrap around you with writing that is poetic and eloquent, will also enjoy this book. Don't miss this one!	2002-03-10

It was predictable, and the hero was almost too good to be true.Now....that said, I really did enjoy this book. I love thrillers (like Ludlum and Forysyth) and this book fits the bill. It was fast paced, very well written, I could see the action and feel some of the emotions. I think it is a great beginning for this author, and I look forward to his next book, and look forward to seeing this character again. So don't let the four stars stop you from reading it, just go into it with the knowledge that you will probably know where the author is going, but you will have fun if you go along for the ride.	2002-03-08

Great character!!<BR>I do have a small complaint though, although really more of a question for Mr.Martel. What happened to the cab and cab driver at the end of the story?

I was fascinated with this story of a life in Africa, growing up in a land that to me seemed so harsh, scary and uncomforatble, and yet so loved by the author and her family. I couldn't imagine living like that, the way her family lived, and I was astounded through the whole book and mesmerised by her matter-of-fact tone when she described different instances.<BR>I did find I had to keep myself from judging the author and her family because of their views on the people in their homeland, and I kept reminding myself that their life is so far removed from my life and anything I understand. I think that is what made it so interesting, so engaging.<BR>I can say, the only thing I wish the author had done was explain why her parents chose to live there, what made them tick, but again, that is putting my judgement on their family, which I am still struggling with. I also am interested in how the author finds living in the states, what life is like for her now. Of course, I have these questions because I became so wrapped up in the author's story, I wasn't ready for it to be over. I wanted to know more about this fascinating woman, and how growing up in this way affected the way she lives now. Exellent read.	2002-01-15

It reminded me of the old gothic novels I used to read, but has much more substance than that. There is a mystery that drives the story, but the most important thing is how this book is written. I am so impressed with this author, her ability to make the reader feel, smell, see, and hear what the character is experiencing. I can't encourage you enough to read this book. I envy you the time you will have wrapping yourself up with this book. When I finished it, I knew that I would be reading this book again, unusual with a mystery, but that is how much this writing affected me. I look forward to Ms. Goodman's next book.	2002-01-14

I really liked it, I liked the idea of an all female resistance team, but something just missed the mark. The action was great, and kept my interest, but I really started out liking it more than I did when I finished it.In other words, great lead in, not enough follow up. I felt like Mr. Follet skimped on character details or something, I just never felt really invested in the characters, just invested in their mission. I gave if 4 star instead of 3, just because it is Ken Follet, and if you are an espionage fan, you should read this. However, I don't think it is his best.	2001-12-19

Acutally this is the second review I have written for it, but for some reason, it didn't get into the system, so if eventually I show up twice reviewing it, sorry...<BR>This is a wonderful book about a man with a most interesting story.  I remember seeing Mr. Kerik on the news after 9/11,and of course, I had no idea of the path his life took to get him to that moment. I don't normally read very much non-fiction, but my sister told me about this book after seeing him on T.V. talking about his life. I am so glad she told me about it. His life has heartache, hard work, danger, excitment and sadness, and he tells you about it as if he is sitting in your living room talking to you. <BR>I can't tell you enough how much I loved this book, I really suggest you read it, and then pass it on to a friend or better yet, buy them one also.

I remember seeing him on T.V. after the September 11th tragedy, standing next to the mayor. We really don't know what goes in other people's lives,what makes them tick,and how life's expereiences have led that person to where he or she is today. Well, in this book, Mr. Kerik tries to explain and it is an amazing life story. <BR>I am anxious to know what happens to him now, and I'm even worried about New York, &quot;The World's City&quot; without him at the helm.<BR>So, read this book,and pass it on or buy one for a friend.  It is inspiring, interesting, exciting,sad and hopeful.	2001-12-02

I am a big fan of Mr. Ludlum and I have been since I read the Scarlatti Inheritance years ago. Some of his later books though, I felt were not up to his usual caliber, but I plugged through every one of them, because hey, a mediocre Ludlum is better than no Ludlum at all.  Well, this one caught my interest from the first page when I started it on Thursday morning.  I would have finished it sooner if I didn't have to stop reading and celebrate my 27th wedding anniversary. My husband is used to me having my face in a book, (maybe that's why we've lasted 27 years), but even I admit this was one day I had to put my book down. <BR>I was so sad as I was reading this book, knowing that Mr. Ludlum has passed away, but I am grateful to his publishers and estate for publishing this book. If you are a Ludlum fan, you know what to expect, so read it and enjoy. If you are new to Mr. Ludlum, read this, enjoy, and then go back and read his others, especially the early ones.	2001-11-11

They say,&quot;that's why people look at the reviews, I could be helping someone else.&quot; So...okay, here goes. This is not Ms. Fairstein's best work. I am an avid fan, and I rush out to buy her books as soon as they hit the shelves.  This one I could have waited for the paper. I felt like she was telling two or three stories at once wihout doing justice to any of them.  Although the information on New York history was interesting, I never connected with the story, didn't know or care about the victims and had the culprit picked out after Alex's (the main character), first interview with him or her.(Even though I didn't like it, I don't want to give it away to someone else!!!!) Anyway, sorry Ms. Fairstein, not my favorite of yours, although I will still run out and buy your next one I'm sure. I have never had will power in a book store, especially for a favorite author.	2001-10-02

When I heard that he would be writing an American Revolution time period book, I was thrilled, knowing his reputaion as a writer from the other books. I was not disappointed. It just so happens that I was reading this book during the awful tragedy of Septmeber 11, and it actually made the book more meaningful. For those of you not familiar with Mr. Shaara's work, all I can say his he makes history come alive.When I finished this book, I wished that schools would use this book to stimulate a teenagers interest in history, and an interest in the forming of our country. I look very forward to the next book in this 2 book series and to this author, a big thank you for a wonderful read.	2001-09-25

The first is of interest to all the mystery readers...this is a good mystery, reads fast and almost any of the suspects could have been the murderer.The author did a good job of making the suspects the sympathetic characters.Although at the end, maybe some readers would have felt a little sympathy for the victim which leads me to my second review.   I had a stepmother like Clio. Over the years, I have tried to explain this person to others, and no one could or would believe that this woman existed.They always assummed I was just the jealous stepdaughter. Well, Ms. Geary,(the author), must have been a fly on the wall during my life. My stepmother was like Clio except my story did not have such a satisfying ending.  So Ms. Geary, wherever you are, I hope Clio is a figment of your imagination because I hate to think you experienced first hand what my sisters and I did, and of course are still dealing with everyday. People don't realize how damaging emotional abuse can be, and how alone children can feel when they can't reach out for help. Even though this is a mystery, I can see myself rereading this book, just for the emotional expressions of the grown stepchildren.  So now you understand why I have given this two separate reviews, one that interests the regular readers, and another for those who have had a Clio in their lives.	2001-08-06

Ms. Kingsolver is a wonderful writer, read this book, and if you haven't read her others, read those too. I envy anyone the experience of reading her books for the first time.  I wonder how it will be when I go back and reread them, because I'm sure I will!	2000-11-01

I am going on a driving vacation with some of the family and I thought I would save this book for the car, something to help pass the time.  The bad new is.....I  have already read it, I couldn't wait.  It was sitting on my shelf calling  to me and since I am a great fan of Jack Reacher and Lee Child, I couldn't  resist.  Now, the good news!  It is a great book.  How on earth did  Mr.Child think of this murderer's m.o.? I could not put this book down.   Bravo Mr. Child.....as soon as I see your next one listed on Amazon., I'll  put in my pre-order.  For anyone who likes a book with a great hero, a few  laughs, lots of suspense and mystery and a twist at the end, read this  book!  If you haven't read the other Jack Reachers, do it now!	2000-07-23

I am a newcomer to the joys of Jane Austen (kind of embarrassing because of my age)and I read this after having read Ms. Austen's 6 completed and most widely read novels.  I really enjoyed reading this book,it has a  little biographical info, trivia and insight into the stories themselves.   Although I didn't agree with everything the author expressed, I would turn  a page and learn something about something else. And of course, as I was  reading it, I kept saying to myself, oh, I need to go back and reread this  book and see what this author is talking about.  How cannot you not  recommend a book that inspires you to reread all of Jane Austen's books!  This book could also be useful in a classroom of high school students, what  a fun way to introduce Jane Austen to students who think she is boring or  hard to read.	2000-07-15

I was so surprised how much I liked it. Fanny, the main character, is  someone I could relate to in ways that many other readers apparently have  not been able to.  Unless you grow up in a home where you are made to feel  unwanted, and have a Mrs. Norris as an aunt in Fanny's case or a stepmom in  my case, it would be hard to understand Fanny.  Take it from me,the  character is very real in many ways and not the wimp or doormat that many  other reviewers find her.  Alot of people said this book of Jane Austen's  is her deepest because of the social issues she tackles. I will have to  read it again to pick up on more of that, I was so busy focusing on Fanny's  situation and understanding her feelings, knowing how her situation  affected her responses, that I missed things. I look forward to reading it  again. I think others will enjoy it too,don't be put off by the other  reviewers.  Of course, I look forward to rereading all my Jane Austens.	2000-07-10

After reading the first book about Jack Reacher, I couldn't wait for the next one.  I was not disappointed.  From the opening pages, when Jack is taken off the streets in a wrong place at wrong time scenario, I was hooked. I read alot of books, all genres, but I really enjoy a good thriller. Mr. Child writes with intelligence and humor, respects the reader with plausible plot and realistic characters.  This is worth the time and money.  Jack Reacher, HURRY BACK!	1998-07-28

I knew going in this was not a Harry Bosch novel, but I still expected a great read and I got it.  Halfway through the story, I thought I had if figured out, but he threw me a curve and as usual with this author, I had a great read that I couldn't wait to get back to whenever real life intruded.  Look forward to his next book!!!!	1998-03-10
