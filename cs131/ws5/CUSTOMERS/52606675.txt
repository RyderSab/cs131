I may not have read The Da Vinci Code yet, but I have seen a few TV specials with titles like \\"Is The Da Vinci Code Real?\\"  (The answer: no.)  I wanted to read Angels & Demons first to keep in order.  Now that I've read it, I think I know what to expect from its more-famous sequel. <br /> <br />On the good side, Angels & Demons starts-off at a gallop and doesn't ease up as it races breathlessly towards its conclusion.  The events in the book only take about twenty-four hours, plus a couple of millennia of backstory.  In a nutshell: an ancient secret society resurfaces with a plan to destroy the Roman Catholic Church and it is up to one man - Harvard Professor, Robert Langdon - and his beautiful bio-entanglement physicist (aren't they all?) sidekick can stop them.  If you think that this sounds like a James Bond movie, it reads like one.  This is not necessarily a bad thing - the novel is paced so furiously, you'll find yourself reading on the edge of your seat, unwilling to stop even for meal breaks.  Along the way, Brown peppers his novel with plenty of science, history, and conspiracy theory to keep you riveted. <br /> <br />On the other hand, this is never going to be considered a literary novel.  Brown doesn't let clichs slow him down as he tells his story.  The characters are two-dimensional and we know many of the stops along the way from watching countless action movies.  There are reversals, and counter-reversals, and counter-counter-reversals.  Robert Langdon starts out as a professor, and ends up as MacGyver.  All along the way, you know you are being manipulated, but that is only part of the territory. <br /> <br />I know enough from The Da Vinci Code controversy to take the supposed \\"facts\\" in the book with a grain of salt.  I did a little research - aided by the invaluable U.S. News & World Report issue - Secrets of Angels & Demons - to find out exactly what is true in the novel.  The answer is: surprisingly little.  Even the background information - presented as fact - which the casual reader might feel justified in believing, is false.  The Illuminati were founded in 1776 and disbanded shortly afterwards - long after the time of Galileo.  Yet Langdon presents Galileo's involvement as common knowledge.  His description of them as a \\"Satanic cult\\" is also off base.  The history of the Hassassin's society is also fictionalized.  CERN is a real place, but Brown takes a lot of creative license with the anti-matter plot.  And as for the possibility of the helicopter escape...right. <br /> <br />Still, it is fun read and interests me enough to pursue The Da Vinci Code. <br />	2005-09-08

Fodor's Caribbean is different from other Fodor's guidebooks; in most cases (Fodor's London, Fodor's Paris) the traveler is beginning with the specific destination in mind.  Those guidebooks are geared to get as much as possible out of a given city.  Fodor's Caribbean is designed to help the reader to DECIDE where to go. <br /> <br />The Caribbean is a vast area and each island is different from the next.  There is something there for everybody.  It runs the gamut in terms of cultures and prices.  The first sixty-six pages of this book are filled with general information about the Caribbean to help you plan your trip.  The \\"What's Where\\" section is especially helpful; it gives a paragraph breakdown on each island.  This is followed by the equally useful \\"Island Finder\\" chart: this is a graph with all the islands arranged vertically and every possible category of interest (price, beaches, golf, night-life, etc.) arranged horizontally.  Each island's price and activities are rated to help you determine which one is best for your interests and your budget.  The introduction also has a ton of other useful information, such as when to go, currency, events, and various other travel tips. <br /> <br />The bulk of the book (and it is a bulky book) is like an encyclopedia of islands; each island (or island cluster) has its own chapter that tells you everything you could possibly want to know about it: history, location, size, population, activities, events, etc.  Of course, all the restaurants and hotels are rated according to quality and price. <br /> <br />For my money, the best islands in the Caribbean are the smaller ones that take more trouble to get to.  St. Barth's used to be the best and most inexpensive island; now it is the best and MOST expensive.  Then, little-known Anguilla became the \\"new\\" St. Barth's; now, it is almost as expensive as the old St. Barth's.  Believe it or not, there are still islands in the Caribbean that you have never heard of, which are unique and authentic and make for the best vacations.  Take Saba, for example: this is an island so small that the islanders only go by their first names.  Saba is simply a volcano rising out of the ocean.  There are no beaches on Saba, but it has some of the best diving around.  There are other islands out there - this book will help you find them. <br />	2005-08-27

Harold Bloom considers Philip Roth one of America's best writers.  Perhaps Roth wrote The Human Stain for Bloom.  It certainly centers on one of Bloom's favorite themes: the decline of the level of education in America.  Coleman Silk is not an easy professor - he goes against the popular belief that, if a subject is hard, universities should refrain from teaching it.  He has little patience with a female student who does not wish to read Aristophanes because it is offensive to women - or with the pseudo-enlightened teacher who supports her decision.  The world of The Human Stain is an increasingly petty, judgmental, and hypocritical America during the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.  In this era of hyper political-correctness, Coleman asks if the students who never bothered to show up for his class are \\"spooks.\\"  When it turns out that the two students are African-American, Coleman's enemies on campus turn it into a racial epithet in order to disgrace him.  The joke: Coleman is himself African-American, and has been \\"passing\\" for white ever since his twenties. <br /> <br />The Human Stain has one of the more sensational plots to be found in a Philip Roth novel, which is perhaps why it was made into a movie.  The heart of the story focuses on the relationship between the 71-year-old Coleman, and his 32-year-old lover, Faunia.  This is one of Roth's favorite themes: an older man having a good time with a younger woman.  Of course, everything ends badly.  That is either the fault of Coleman, America, or both. <br /> <br />The interesting thing about the novel is that it is told from the perspective of Nathan Zuckerman.  Yet Zuckerman writes with the authority of a third-person-omniscient narrator.  He describes thoughts in his characters' heads and scenes that he never witnessed.  Eventually, Zuckerman is forced to admit that he is just using his imagination to make things up because that is his job. <br /> <br />There are weaknesses to the book.  Roth gives into his desireto pontificate.  He is in love with his own writing style and the book would have benefited from some more editing - it is about twenty percent too long.  Yet, it is one of Roth's better novels and shows him in fine form later in life. <br />	2005-08-25

Lets do the cons first.  There is no new material in this book - it is a collection of articles that Smith had written for the Internet a number of years ago.  The result is that most of the information is hopelessly out-of-date.  The reader will not find any new gossip - just old gossip.  Also, I don't know if any movie's production needs so much documentation - let alone Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  It is unlikely that this book will make it into the annals of Great Literature. <br /> <br />However, on the good side, Kevin Smith is a surprisingly good prose writer.  I know from his movies that he can be funny and turn a good phrase through dialogue when he really wants to, but these essays show that, not only does he have the ability to be funny on the printed page, but that he is quite a skilled narrative writer as well - conjuring a scene with a few lines of economic, effective description.  Even when describing what he does in the bathroom, Smith is a master of finding le mot juste. <br /> <br />Also - like the nonfiction works of William Goldman - this book provides a look inside Hollywood from a \\"regular guy's\\" perspective.  Kevin Smith will always view himself as some jerk from New Jersey who got incredibly lucky and fell in with the beautiful people.  I can certainly relate to his preference for living in the Garden State and his aversion to life in L.A. - having lived in both places.  He is quite willing to dish the dirt like an old lady on Hollywood phonies such as Reese Witherspoon - whom he refers to as \\"Greasy Reese Witherspoon.\\" <br /> <br />I don't think that this book is for everyone.  As in his movies, Smith's basic flaw is his lack of confidence in himself as a writer.  It's obvious that he is talented - if he were only more disciplined, or had better editors, he would produce better product.  When Smith is desperate to be funny, he will simply be as crude as possible.  Still, I like his movies and -as Smith himself acknowledges - many people like HIM, and hence pay money for his stuff.  If you are one of the fans of Kevin Smith as a character unto himself, this book is just the thing for you. <br />	2005-08-16

I find Philip Roth's debut novella, Goodbye, Columbus, to be much more enjoyable than his more famous work, Portnoy's Complaint.  For one thing, Columbus is much shorter - it gets to the point.  It is not endlessly repetitive, the way Portnoy is - nor is Roth as full of himself in this more modest work. <br /> <br />Goodbye, Columbus has all the heart that Portnoy's Complaint lacks.  It is the proverbial \\"coming of age\\" story of Neil Klugman.  Neil is the Philip Roth stand-in - like Roth, he is a poor Jewish boy from Newark.  He has his first great love affair with Brenda Patimkin - a rich girl from Short Hills.  Brenda is all he could ever want in a woman, so everything should be perfect...right?  The reader may guess at the stops along the way, but predictability isn't really the issue - it's the journey that matters. <br /> <br />I found the short stories in this collection less appealing.  They are all on the same theme: the aversion Roth feels towards Jewish-American culture, while being a Jewish-American.  This is one of the central themes in his novels as well, but his short stories are not able to support this theme as well as the other diversions that make his novels enjoyable.  As such, the short stories are one-trick-ponies, and I found them tiring.  Perhaps this is the reason that Roth is known as a novelist and not a short-story writer.  However, the book is worth purchasing for the novella alone. <br />	2005-08-15

The previous installment, The Order of the Phoenix, was perhaps my least favorite; throughout the bulk of the novel, nothing much happened and Dumbledore and Voldemort were hardly in it until the end.  The Half-Blood Prince makes up for this, however - Dumbledore and Voldemort are in it A LOT.  I would even go so far as to say that this is Dumbledore's novel.   <br /> <br />This is one of the best novels in the series.  It is the darkest novel yet.  Order of the Phoenix was downbeat, but claustrophobic; Delores Umbridge exercised such a reign of terror over Harry Potter and Hogwarts that the reader was often left in a state of frustration.  In this installment, the fight between good and evil has been taken out in the open.  Dumbledore officially takes Harry as his apprentice in the fight against Voldemort.  Through Dumbledore's pensieve, we get to see how the handsome young Tom Riddle became the Dark Lord Voldemort. <br /> <br />It is impossible to read these books and not think of Star Wars.  They are both about a \\"Chosen One\\" fighting an Evil Dark Lord.  That would make The Half-Blood Prince the Empire Strikes Back episode.  Things turn pretty bleak for our heroes.  There are a number of jaw-dropping surprises (it is difficult to go into the plot of the novel without giving anything away).  Like Empire Strikes Back, this installment ends on a terrible cliffhanger, leaving reader to think: \\"I can't wait another two or three years to find out how this ends!\\" <br /> <br />This is the sixth book of a seven-book-series.  The knowledge that our time with Harry Potter is almost over is hammered-home throughout the book, as relationships develop, people grow, and the inevitable conclusion draws near.  Now, the stage is set.  In the next novel, there will be the Ultimate Showdown between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.  The circle is almost complete.   <br />	2005-08-10
US	52606675	RSK7EA7U54YJD	0679749004	958355265	The Professor of Desire	Books	4	17	19	N	N	Finally, a Roth novel I like!	This is the first novel by Philip Roth that I actually like.  Portnoy's Complaint was a good hundred-page novella, spread out over a three-hundred page book; the other pages were filled with the dross of his political opinions, and his kvetching about his parents.  Operation Shylock was also too pre-occupied with pushing a political agenda (but just what agenda, we are never sure).  This is Roth's primary fault as an author - he is too didactic.  I find that I really don't care much about what Roth's political opinions are.  Ironically, this is probably one of the attributes that make him a critical darling - it shows that he thinks \\"deep thoughts.\\" <br /> <br />The Professor of Desire is blessedly free of politics.  In it, Roth sticks with the subjects he knows best: sex and relationships.  Young David Kepesh is a sexually frustrated young student.  That changes while studying abroad in Swinging London, where he finds that what they say about Swedish girls is true.  Things take a turn for the worse after the end of his disastrous marriage finds him crushed by loneliness in New York.  With the help of a psychiatrist, Kepesh tries to discover if he will ever be able to commit to anyone or experience happiness. <br /> <br />The Professor of Desire finds Roth at a more mature place in his career.  Gone is the odious kvetching about his parents that polluted so much of Portnoy's Complaint; the parents in this book are treated with sympathy.  At one point, a character points out to Kepesh that there is no point in mining the workings of a Jewish family for his fiction anymore.  He is also less homophobic in this novel - but not much so.  There are still things about Roth's style that take getting used to; I don't think there's anything profound in his refusal to offset dialogue into separate paragraphs - it just makes it harder to keep track of who is speaking.  However, The Professor of Desire is a short, lyrical novel that is the best of anything I've read of his so far. <br />	2005-08-02

Philip Roth is a taste I haven't acquired yet.  He is lauded by critics - including Harold Bloom, who just happens to be a friend of his - as perhaps the greatest living American writer.  Before this novel, I had only read Portnoy's Complaint, which I couldn't even finish; I found it hopelessly dated, pedantic, and repetitive.  I like Operation Shylock more than Portnoy's Complaint, I guess - although I can't say that I really ENJOYED either.  However, at least things happen in this novel.  The gimmick of the book is that it is a \\"confession\\" - a story of supposedly true events that happened to Philip Roth in 1988.  The story concerns the emergence of a \\"fake\\" Philip Roth who is traveling around Israel, promoting the cause of \\"Diasporism\\" - the relocation of Israel's Jews back to Europe.  The real Roth travels to Jerusalem to confront his impostor.   <br /> <br />Having now read the book, it is difficult to tell whether or not the real Roth is for Diasporism.  There is a lot of anti-Zionist rhetoric in the book - much of which I found distasteful - but is that the \\"real\\" Roth or not?  Is he really anti-Zionist?  It's hard to say, because he frequently asserts how foolish Diasporism is: the European community would not welcome the Jews back with open arms.    <br /> <br />Somewhere in one of Raymond Chandler's novels, Philip Marlowe mocks Hemmingway as a man who thinks saying the same thing over and over makes it profound.  Well, the same thing can be said of Philip Roth.  There are a lot of things about his style I don't like.  He is very pedantic: he always has an axe to grind, but instead, he grinds his readers into the ground.  He allows his characters to speak, sometimes for pages at a time, without so much as starting a new paragraph.  His most annoying trait however, is how in love with himself he is.  It's odd but true - if you keep saying how great you are, people will believe you.  Through his characters, he lavishes praise onto himself and his books.  Also, he's apparently catnip to the ladies. <br /> <br />Is this novel non-fiction?  Of course not.  Will I ever read another Philip Roth novel?  Probably - with so many critics telling me I'm wrong, I have to allow for that possibility.  I'm just not looking forward to the experience. <br />	2005-07-26

This is not a text book, but it should be required reading for anyone who wants a career in the motion picture industry - or anyone who loves film in general.  Why is it not a textbook?  Because it is one heck of an entertaining read.  The book runs almost six-hundred pages and I devoured it in just a couple of days. <br /> <br />William Goldman is one of most respected screenwriters alive; he knows as much about it as anyone.  What he gives us is a picture of Hollywood (the business and who does what), the art of writing a screenplay, the process of working on a film, and his own personal anecdotes.  One of the chief pleasures of the book is how cheerfully gossipy it is.  \\"PART ONE: HOLLYWOOD REALITIES\\" is full of stories of the excesses of Hollywood that people out there consider normal.  A lot of the time he doesn't supply names, but sometimes he does.  (Dustin Hoffman, while a brilliant actor, is notorious for being a bit eccentric.)  He also gives us an idea of how the studio works and how pictures get made. <br /> <br />The last third of the book will primarily interest serious film students.  Goldman includes his entire script for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and uses it as a teaching tool.  Then he presents a short story he wrote and uses that as a teaching tool regarding adapting previously written material.   <br /> <br />This book was written in 1982 and reading it is a stroll down memory lane.  That was a dark time in motion picture history.  Most of the films he references from that period have been forgotten.  In other words, it is just like today.  We need to read this book again more than ever. <br />	2005-07-09

In children's literature, the hero often faces extreme hardship.  Most often, his or her parents are killed and the hero is left as an orphan, dealing with evil stepparents or the like.  Charlie Bucket is spared that fate - both his parents are still living.  In fact, Charlie is a member of a large, loving household.  The Buckets problem is that they are poor - very, very, very poor.  They are starving, in fact.  Reading this book as an adult, it is striking to see just how extreme their suffering is.  They all suffer from malnutrition; Charlie has to leave early for school because, if he runs, he will pass out from exhaustion. <br /> <br />The cruelty of their starvation is exacerbated because they live right next to the most famous chocolate factory in the world.  Charlie loves chocolate more than anything else, but can only afford one bar a year - on his birthday.   When Willy Wonka announces that he has hidden five golden tickets to his factory in chocolate bars all over the world, chances look pretty slim that Charlie will find one.  However, considering the name of the book is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you can guess how it turns out. <br /> <br />The movie is such a classic that it is hard to come to this book without preconceptions.  Now, with the new movie, there is a danger that the book may get lost in the shuffle.  That is a shame.  The book stands on its own and should be read first.  For one thing, the book is less scary than the movie - the Oompa-Loompas are far less creepy.  For another, Roald Dahl's style is fun enough to be interesting to adults as well as children.  One danger though - reading this book makes you crave chocolate! <br />	2005-06-29

In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner state that there is no unifying theme to this book.  That is true and works to its benefit.  The result is a compendium of odd information with some pretty startling conclusions that will improve your cocktail-party chatter enormously.   <br /> <br />To say that the book has no cohesion would be taking things too far.  First, we learn what Economics is, in theory.  The points the authors make are 1) The discipline of Economics is merely just a set of tools for looking at the world (Adam Smith considered himself a moral philosopher), and 2) If morality is a vision of the world as we'd like it to be, Economics is a view of the world as it is.  Thus, Levitt uses the tools of Economics to ask questions such as, Why do drug dealers still live with their mothers? <br />  <br />One of the chief appeals of the book is the way it tries to distance itself from emotions or editorializing.  Numbers don't lie, as they say, and they are just analyzing the data.  However, they do take a few backhanded shots a mayor Rudy Giuliani.  It is part of their Roe v. Wade chapter that he really didn't do anything for New York.  They concede that he got rid of the \\"small crimes\\" like the window-washers, which was part of his appeal.  Anyone who is familiar with the pre-Giuliani New York knows that this is understatement at best (Times Square is no longer a demilitarized zone).   <br /> <br />Yet, the book steers away from politics for the most part.  The authors' goal is to help the reader to see the world in a new way, and perhaps ask different kinds of questions.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-27

Like most other people, I was familiar with the movie The Princess Bride before I came to the book.  The main question I had was, \\"Will it still interest me, even though I know the movie by heart?\\"  The answer is an overwhelming YES!  Yes, it is very much like the movie, but there is so much more; there's all the backstory; the funny asides; the bits about the abridgement.  This is a book to make you laugh out loud. <br /> <br />There are some things that may turn readers off.  Before the story proper starts, William Goldman includes a long preface (two, for the anniversary edition), plus a preface for the first chapter of Buttercup's Baby at the end.  These get a little long.  Also, Goldman is callous when describing his son's weight problem, and his ex-wife.  I felt that way until I found out that the real William Goldman doesn't have a son.  For those of you interested, look him up on Wikipedia.  Also, if anyone out there wants to travel to Florin for the summer, or talk to Professor Bongiorno of Columbia about S. Morgenstern's abilities as a writer, you are going to be in for a disappointment.  <br /> <br />Early on, Goldman professes his love of adventure novels.  He has succeeded in creating a great one.  It's inconceivable. <br />	2005-06-24

There comes a sickening moment about half-way through this book, when the reader realizes that Zorro is not going to be in it at all.  Well, this isn't exactly true - we get glimpses of Zorro here and there, and a brief adventure at the end.  However, this is the \\"origin story\\" - to use comic-book terms.  But, even origin stories usually spend half the time explaining how the hero got to be the hero, and the other half showing his first adventure.  In this book, Zorro's first adventure is relegated to the last few pages.  Like The Phantom Menace, this is the story of what happened BEFORE the story. <br /> <br />And yet this is an adventure novel.  While Zorro doesn't see much action, Diego de la Vega certainly does.  We see all Diego's many childhood adventures in California, and then in Spain.  (To be perfectly fair, Diego first dons the Zorro garb in Spain for several adventures.)   <br /> <br />Part of the problem with the book is how exhaustive it is in detail.  Isabel Allende took the task of writing an origin story VERY seriously.  The book begins long before Diego is even born.  We witness the union of his parents - a Spaniard and a half-Spanish, half-Native American woman.  This is important because it gives Zorro a Native America heritage; a genius bit of invention is letting Diego go on a Vision Quest (guess what his spirit animal is!).  Allende's research is also very educational for the average reader, painting a picture of the world in the early 1800's. <br /> <br />Despite its faults, I enjoyed this book.  It may be an over-the-top, old-fashioned bodice-ripper, but I found it fun and entertaining.  Like the superheroes he foreshadowed, there will always be something fascinating about Zorro: he is a fun character with a great love of life.  Allende paints him as a perennial adolescent, who is having too much fun to grow up.  Now, if only she would write the part of the story we want to read. <br />	2005-06-23

In A Long Way Down, Nick Hornby writes a life-affirming novel without being life-affirming.  On New Year's Eve, four people decide independently to jump off the same building at the same time.  They soon discover that this isn't as great a coincidence as it seems because the building (Toppers' House) is notorious for attracting suicides and New Year's Eve (along with Valentine's Day) is one of the most popular nights on which to do it. <br /> <br />They all have different reasons for wanting to do themselves in.  Maureen is burdened with a teenage son who has always been in a vegetative state.  Martin - the \\"British Regis\\" - was publicly disgraced and imprisoned.  JJ is an American musician who has just lost his band and his girlfriend.  Jess is...well, too troubled to explain. <br /> <br />Once they all find themselves together, they find suicide is something that is hard to do with other people watching.  Instead, they go on a quest to find Jess's ex-boyfriend.  It gives them something to do other than kill themselves.  That's what they end up doing for each other - creating things to do other than kill themselves. <br /> <br />In the hands of a lesser writer, this could have been sappy and predictable, but Hornby writes a funny book about suicide.  Part of the problem is that, after they decide not to commit suicide, that can't think of why.  They have had no revelations.  They don't feel better about life.  They don't even LIKE each other. <br /> <br />What gives the book real forward momentum is that it is narrated in the first person by each of the four characters.

It is almost impossible to summarize The World is Flat.  Of course, there's the book's central thesis: the \\"Web-enabled playing field that allows for multiple forms of collaboration - the sharing of knowledge and work - in real time, without regard to geography, distance, or, in the near future, even language\\" has made the world flat.  However, there just so much INFORMATION in the book that it really is difficult to encapsulate.   <br /> <br />Friedman goes through all the technical and geopolitical developments that have made the world flat.  One of the most useful parts of this book is where he lists popular Internet sites.  For example, there's Alexa.com (run by Amazon) which lists the most popular sites on the Web according to categories. <br /> <br />This really is a history of the twenty-first century, so far.  Much of the book is a discussion of China and India - how they are racing us to the top and not the bottom.  I also learned a lot about terrorism: who the terrorists are and why they do what they do. <br /> <br />Of course, at the end of the book, Friedman comes clean with us: the world really ISN'T flat - not yet, anyway - but it is getting there.  Some of the predictions are dire, but there is a lot of possibility for hope.  The world turning flat can be a good thing. <br />	2005-05-30

Any dedicated Elmore Leonard fan will remember Carl Webster - indeed, the beginning of this novel - from McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales.  That short story is the springboard for this book. <br /> <br />In many ways, this is a different kind of novel for Elmore Leonard.  Like his westerns and Cuba Libre, it is a historical novel - set in the twenties and thirties.  By grounding his story in famous gangsters of the past, Leonard makes this less of a comedy than his other novels - not that it isn't funny.  There isn't really a plot: it recounts the adventures of Federal Marshall Carl Webster - the \\"Hot Kid\\" of the title.  When a gangster steals his ice cream cone at the age of fifteen, Carl is set on the path of becoming a lawman.  Good-looking, and a taste for getting his name in the newspapers, Carl becomes an outlaw's worst nightmare. <br /> <br />Along the way we meet Jack Belmont, a classic Leonard villain - stupid and without empathy.  Jack has a rich father and could have all the money he wants if he just asked nicely, but he wants to be Public Enemy Number One instead.  Inevitably, Jack and Carl cross paths. <br /> <br />The book isn't about the straight line getting Jack and Carl together - it's about all the diversions along the way.  You learn a lot about history and the history of crime reading The Hot Kid...and a lot about writing too. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-27

He is from the Elmore Leonard school of modern-day pulp fiction writers.  His heroes are terribly ordinary and his villains are dumb with a capital \\"D.\\"  <br /> <br />The story concerns Jack Tagger - an obituary-writer at a local Florida newspaper.  He used to be a real reporter until he publicly insulted the paper's new publisher, who is running it into the ground.  One day, he notices that a \\"James Stomarti\\" has died and realizes that it is Jimmy Stoma, lead singer of a famous rock band.  In writing his obituary, he interviews his young starlet wife and discovers that something strange is going on. <br /> <br />Like Leonard, Hiassen is a funny writer.  What is fascinating about this book is the glimpse it provides into the real world of journalism.  Since Hiaasen is a Pulitzer Prize-winner reporter himself, he should know what it is like.  Like Be Cool, this is a black comedy filled with murderers and music industry professionals...and they're all the same people.   <br /> <br />	2005-05-02

I don't think that it is an exaggeration to call The Big Sleep one of the best American novels ever written.  It is the novel that introduces Phillip Marlowe to the world - as well as the inimitable literary styling of Raymond Chandler.  No one knew how to work a simile quite the way Chandler could.  It has been parodied, but never duplicated. <br /> <br />The plot of the novel is almost impossible to follow, but who cares.  Phillip Marlowe is hired by General Sternwood because he is being blackmailed.  Soon after, people keep turning up dead.  \\"So many guns in this town and so little brains,\\" Marlowe observed.  There is the famous story: when Howard Hawks was filming the movie, he couldn't figure out who killed the chauffer.  He sent a letter to Chandler - who couldn't figure it out either. <br /> <br />Just enjoy the book.  It not only bears reading but re-reading.  It is truly classic literature.   <br />	2005-04-26

This cookbook is for the person who loves French cafs in general, and Balthazar in specific.  In France, cafs are everywhere, and they are the center of social life much the same way as pubs are in England - the difference is that the food at the average English pub is terrible and the food at the average French caf is great.  Menus may vary from caf to caf, but there are certain standard items that they tend to have in common.  Many consider Balthazar the best French caf in New York.  The irony is that - in France - cafs are informal and inexpensive places, whereas Balthazar is expensive, usually requires reservations, and almost has a celebrity or two eating there.  What makes Balthazar a caf is that it serves all the standard caf fare, but with it's own unique touch. <br /> <br />What makes The Balthazar Cookbook so great is that it is a compendium of all the classic caf items: \\"Steak Frites,\\" \\"Moules a la Mariniere,\\" and \\"Escargots with Garlic Butter,\\" just to name a few.  These aren't run-of-the-mill recipes, but Balthazar's own special ones.  This is both the book's virtue and its vice.  This is not a cookbook for the novice chef.  Most of the recipes are fabulously complicated.  It assumes that you have the basic skills of cooking as it does not go over simple procedures.  It assumes that you have a well-stocked kitchen because many of the recipes call for specialized hardware like Dutch ovens and candy thermometers.  It also assumes that you have access to hoity-toity gourmet food stores where you can get all of their obscure ingredients. <br /> <br />I attempted the basic caf dish: Steak Frites.  The steak was no problem as it is just grilled.  What makes this special is the herb butter Balthazar puts on top.  I cheated and used bottled sage and chives instead of fresh, and it still came out pretty good.  The French fries proved more difficult as they require a thermometer to tell you when the peanut oil (I substituted vegetable) reaches EXACTLY370 degrees for the first frying and 380 degrees for the second.  I didn't have a thermometer so I guessed - the result was that they were nowhere near as good as the fries at Balthazar, which could be the best in the city.  With fries you need mayonnaise.  I had two failed attempts at making mine in the food processor (as they suggest) before moving on to the blender, which worked fine.   <br /> <br />In the end, this is an excellent cookbook.  It's only problem is that, for casual food, it takes a LOT of preparation.    <br />	2005-04-12

Like Ulysses and Mrs. Dalloway, Saturday joins the ranks of books that concern themselves with the events of a single day.  Neurosurgeon Henry Perowne awakens early one Saturday morning in 2003 to watch a plane crash-land at Heathrow Airport.  This improbable coincidence begins what will prove to be a VERY busy day for him.  The impending Iraq war looms over Henry as he tries to drive around the largest protest in British history.  He gets into a car accident with someone who turns out to be a very nasty customer, and it all goes downhill from there. <br /> <br />Of course, by the very nature of the book, it is not a thrill-a-minute page turner.  The pleasure comes from allowing McEwen to exercise his considerable literary talents.  Saturday is a very lyrical novel with many digressions and asides.  The main topic of conversation is the war in Iraq and the world after nine-eleven.  It was my fear that this would be a preachy, heavy-handed novel with some trite, anti-violence message.  To its credit, Perowne is conflicted about the upcoming war; he has an Iraqi friend who was tortured by Saddam and is well-informed of his atrocities.  As he watches the protesters, he feels that - even if they are right - they should not be so joyful about advocating the continuation of torture and murder. <br /> <br />There are the occasional missteps here and there: I felt the description of the squash match went on for too long; he unknowingly plagiarizes Chuck Berry when he writes that Theo \\"played guitar like an angel ringing a bell.\\"  Yet, in the end, it is a thoughtful, beautifully-written, meditative piece on the nature of life in the twenty-first century - what we have to fear, and what we have to hope for. <br />	2005-03-30

Foer invents a great central character - Oskar Schell, an eight-year-old Manhattan boy whose father has died in the World Trade Center.  He finds a key in an envelope in his father's closet and the novel is about his journeys to find the lock the key opens and the people he meets along the way. <br /> <br />Foer wisely avoids politics in this piece; this book is not about that.  Young Oskar considers himself a pacifist and doesn't believe in killing people for anything.  As in Everything is Illuminated, Foer has an overriding interest in the holocaust and World War II.  In this case, Oskar's grandparents are survivors of the bombing of Dresden and much of the book is their story.  Also, as in his previous book, this one employs several first person narrators.  Most of the story is told directly from Oskar's perspective, but we also have first-hand accounts \\"written\\" by his grandmother and grandfather. <br /> <br />What sets Jonathan Safran Foer apart is that he is endlessly innovative.  He makes it his life's mission to expand the boundaries of the printed book.  He uses every trick he can think of: pictures, code, blank space.  If you are unsympathetic to this, you might find it a bit gimmicky, but I found that it made the reading like an Easter egg hunt. <br /> <br />The book may not be without it flaws, but it is a funny, provocative, humanistic novel.  As Oskar says, \\"Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers.  The smoke rises at different speeds, but they're all on fire, and we're all trapped.\\" <br />	2005-03-22

Ursala Hegi's Intrusions is about the thin membrane that separates an author's \\"real\\" life from the fictional universe she creates.  Hegi herself appears as a character.  All Hegi wants to do is finish writing a novel but her family keeps interrupting her writing sessions. <br /> <br />The \\"I\\" in this book always refers to the character Ursala Hegi who is also writing the book.  Hegi is not the main character of the novel - that is \\"Megan.\\"  However, Megan only exists as a character in the book Ursala Hegi (the character and the real person) is writing.  Thus, what we have are two parallel texts: the story that Hegi is writing AND the story of how she is writing it.  The technique she employs is to alternate chapters - some belong to the \\"real life\\" storyline and some belong to the Megan storyline.  Pretty soon, her \\"made-up\\" characters are \\"intruding\\" on her life just as much as her real family intrudes on her fantasy. <br />  <br />In Intrusions, people break character in order to challenge the author's authority.  Nick says, \\"I know all about author's prerogative.  What about author's responsibility?\\" As is common in metafiction, Hegi uses an overtly artificial device to get at underlying truths.  By making Nick and Megan break character, she is able to take the reader into the artistic process of writing a novel and to demonstrate the way a fictional character really is alive.  The real drama of this book is if Hegi will really be able to finish it at all.  She fears that all great female authors had to choose a career over family.  Can't she have both? <br /> <br />Intrusions is a funny, smart, and insightful look at the writing process, especially from a woman's point of view.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-21

It is almost impossible to explain the plot of \\"If on a winter's night, a traveler\\" - if indeed there is one.  This is a book composed of ten first chapters of completely unrelated novels.  Well, that's HALF of the book, anyway.  Every OTHER chapter is your adventure (it is YOUR adventure - the book is written in the second person) to try to find the rest of all the books that you've begun reading. <br /> <br />Needless to say, this is an experimental novel.  I am not the Ideal Reader for it as experimental novels are not usually my cup of tea.  There is no \\"plot\\" to pull you from the beginning of the book to the end, but that's the whole point.  This book is about reading; about the expectations that we bring to reading - and how it confounds them.  Even the books-within-books are wildly metafictional. <br /> <br />That is the best that I can describe it.  Even though it is not the type of book I'd want to curl up with, I appreciate the wonderful trick Calvino pulls off.  <br />	2005-03-13

Most of this book is written as a guide; depending on where you live, you can look up your area to find the best pizza around.  Ed Levine ranks pizzas all across the country and in Italy.  In general, the best pie is found in the New York City area.  The best in the world is Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, Arizona - Chris Bianco is originally from the Bronx.  I have gone to Totonno's Pizza - rated the best in New York - and it is exceptional. <br /> <br />SPECIAL NOTE: Levine is ostracized from Chicago for calling deep dish pizza \\"a good casserole at best.\\"  The negative reviews on this cite are all from disgruntled citizens of Chicago.  <br /> <br />The beginning of the book contains the history and science of pizza, as well as pizza essays by various writers.  Of course, there is also a recipe.  The trouble is, to make pizza right, you need a nine-hundred-degree brick oven.  The method they have of duplicating this at home is to have an outdoor charcoal pit.  Without the pit, you use your own oven.  Most ovens only get up to about five-hundred-degrees so the pizza takes a little longer to cook and the crust does not come out perfectly.  However, home-made pizza is almost always better than delivery pizza.  I tried the recipe in my own oven and it came out pretty good. <br />	2005-03-08

Breakfast of Champions reads as a fresh work, considering today's political climate.  It is a very anti-American novel and, depending how you voted in the last election, you will either love it or hate it.  The plot concerns a science fiction author, Kilgore Trout (a pun on real-life author Theodore Sturgeon), and a car dealer named Dwayne Hoover.  Hoover is going out of his mind and - after reading one of Trout's books - comes to believe that he is the only person in the world who isn't a robot. <br /> <br />This is an experimental novel.  Vonnegut writes himself into the book and fills it with crude illustrations.  It is funny, biased, and thought-provoking look on American society.  It doesn't have a traditional \\"beginning, middle, and end.\\"  Vonnegut expressly states that he disdains traditional fiction writing because it makes people believe that they should act like characters in books.

It is difficult to discuss the book since the movie has become so famous.  I saw the movie first and, although I thought it was flawed, it was still a remarkable piece of filmmaking - especially the first half.  Everything that was great about the film came directly from the book. <br /> <br />I imagine a lot of people take Fight Club as their bible.  I don't think that even Palahniuk feels that way.  Tyler Durden doesn't really have a consistent philosophy to live one's life; if we needed to hunt elk through Rockefeller Center, that would be just as stifling as having to work in an office for a living.   <br /> <br />What makes Fight Club a great novel is that it taps into something we have all felt.  Modern society has made everything corporate.  Authentic experience is getting harder and harder to come by.  We lose our soul working jobs we hate to earn money to buy things that we don't need. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-21

This is the third translation of Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera that I have purchased, and I don't regret it.  Most of us are familiar with the \\"official\\" translation - the one that is the tie-in for the musical (and countless other editions).  Leonard Wolf gives us a newer and - as he feels - more faithful interpretation of the French text.  (Sidenote: In the tie-in translation, the Phantom never refers to himself as the Phantom: only as the Opera Ghost, or O.G.  In this version, he is always the more musical Phantom of the Opera.)   <br /> <br />If you have not read Phantom yet, you may be a bit distracted by the voluminous footnotes.  For the familiar reader however, the footnotes are the main reason to buy this edition.  Wolf provides valuable insight into many areas of the text.  He points out inconsistencies: Raoul goes from being 21 to 20.  He provides commentary on the mythological allusions in the text.   <br /> <br />Most valuable, he provides artistic commentary on the book.  He shows how Phantom fits into Gothic conventions: the damsel-in-distress being menaced by a sexually threatening outsider, only to be rescued by a non-sexual aristocrat.  But it is not quite that simple; Wolf shows that there are only two protagonists in the piece: Christine and Erik.  He rightly shows Raoul for the foolish little sap that he is.  He thinks that Leroux intended it to be that way, and that Christine has a much stronger bond with Erik than she does Raoul. <br /> <br />On the whole, I wish Wolf had written more.  How about interpretive essays on the various adaptations, including the Lloyd Weber musical?  He does include a lengthy introduction about the novel and Gaston Leroux himself.  This volume is a must-have for any Phantom-enthusiast. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-31

Few authors can \\"hook\\" a reader as well as Victor Hugo: as soon as you crack the spine, he has you.  Notre Dame is short when compared to Les Miserables, but it is still a long book, taken on its own.  Yet Hugo manages to bring you through at breakneck speed (with the notable exception of his long digression into architecture). <br /> <br />I have seen Hugo referred to as a romantic writer, but he is one of the most cynical authors I have ever read - at least when it comes to human nature.  I think that is the one aspect of his writing that is most often lost (or ejected) when translating his work to stage or screen.  Fans of the show Les Mis may be a bit shocked to find out how un-sentimental the book is.  Similarly, I'd seen movie versions of The Hunchback, but I was surprised how modern Hugo's characterizations are.  The closest thing to a hero is Quasimodo, whom Hugo describes as \\"evil.\\"  The \\"heroine\\" is La Esmeralda: even though she is basically a good woman, she is capable of being cruel towards Quasimodo, and she is jaw-droppingly stupid.  There are two pseudo-heroes: Pierre Gringoire and Phoebus.  Gringoire is a foolish, happy-go-lucky playwright who loves Esmeralda's goat as much as he loves her.  Phoebus is really a cad - a villain who is not worth Esmeralda's affection.  The most surprising thing about the book is its massive-downer ending.  This may not be a Disney film, but it is one of the most entertaining works of classic literature.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-28

Then, one day, a young boy with a parrot on his shoulder strolls into his life.   <br /> <br />This is a very modest story: the safety of the free world does not rest on the outcome.  It does not rely on previous Sherlock Holmes literature: Dr. Watson and Lestrade are not here; we do not find out what happened to the old man since his retirement.  Chabon's style is so distinctive, we always are aware that we are reading him and not Arthur Conan Doyle; but, as Chabon is one of my favourite writers, that is not a bad thing.  However, he is true to the character: I am sure that he must have read all of the real Holmes stories and gives us valuable insight into his mind at the end of his life.  This is an entertaining read and would interest any fan of Sherlock Holmes or Michael Chabon.  <br />	2005-01-05

It's uncommon to imagine a rather funny book on the subject of punctuation.  Lynne Truss goes through all of the most common punctuation marks, gives us their history, and makes them all seem interesting too.  (For instance, in the preceding sentence, the comma after \\"history\\" is called the Oxford comma: it is standard in American usage but not in British.)  This is not a book on grammar: Truss claims to believe that a subordinate clause is one of the elves who help Santa.  However, she is a stickler for punctuation: especially the misplaced apostrophe used by greengrocers! <br /> <br />This is a book written by a Brit, so it is interesting to note the difference between American and British usage.  For instance, what we call a \\"period\\" is the \\"full stop\\" in the UK. <br /> <br />This might seem un-fun, but trust me - there are no quizzes at the end of each chapter.  The rules are explained in layman's terms (I hope I wrote that correctly) and it is all a good read.

A Prayer for Owen Meany is a long, sprawling, coming-of-age epic.  I don't mean \\"coming-of-age\\" in the usual, puerile American sense of \\"making time with girls.\\"  It is about the loss of innocence suffered by two boys and by a country.  It is told in the first-person by Johnny Wheelwright, and the book is a prayer for his lost best friend, Owen Meany.  Owen was the smallest person he ever knew, with a voice that sounded like a permanent scream, who believed he was God's instrument.  Don't let the subject-matter fool you - this is a warm, and often funny book.  The only reason to put it down is that it is too long to be read at one sitting. <br /> <br />Irving is very critical of America in this novel.  He portrays the United States as a stupid, arrogant, international bully that is rightly hated by other countries.  Agreeing with him is not essential to enjoying the book, but - readers be warned - his opinion is there.  (Fans of the late President Reagan will have issue with it.)  However, the book is really about friendship, growing up, and the mystery of Faith.  This is a book that will stay with you. <br />	2004-12-15

Harold Bloom refers to it merely as one of his \\"entertainments.\\"  Unlike the best Dickens novels - Great Expectations, David Copperfield, Nicholas Nickleby - there is no central character here for the reader to latch onto.  As is the trouble, the \\"good guys\\" in the book are a bit boring.  Sometimes Dickens has a social axe to grind, and I find those novels less interesting.  One of the problems here, which is attendant upon the lack of a central character, is the lack of a focused plot.  Only towards the end of the novel, do we get a sense of what the point is.<br /><br />On the other hand, a lesser novel by Dickens is better than most other authors' great novels.  Even though there is no central character, it is filled with a host of unforgettable lesser characters - especially the diabolic Madame DeFarge.  Dickens captures the corruption of the Ancient Regime and then the corruption of the Reign of Terror that followed it.  After all, this is THE NOVEL of the French Revolution.  It also contains some of Dickens's best narrative descriptions and may possibly possess the greatest opening and closing lines of any novel:  \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\\" and \\"It is a far, far better thing I do...\\"	2004-12-15

Gaston Leroux was a reporter who also wrote mystery novels.  Thus, he places himself in the action of this story.  He is a reporter who has uncovered the secret of a \\"true mystery\\" that terrified the Paris Opera House thirty years previous.  He presents the events \\"factually\\" from the documents and interviews with living witnesses.  It has much in common with other mystery novels - like The Hound of the Baskervilles - in which supernatural things seem to happen, but in reality there is a \\"logical\\" explanation.  Thus, The Phantom of the Opera is part mystery, part horror, and part romance.  It is also part journalism; Leroux's inspiration was the Paris Opera House itself - which exists exactly as he describes it.  It even has a lake and everything.  The story of the falling chandelier is partially true - a counter-weight once fell. <br /> <br />When he first discovered the magnificence of the Opera, he decided to write a plot-driven novel about a deformed genius who has taken up his residence on the shore of the lake that exists in the cellar.  The book is definitely a page-turner - there are many great \\"set pieces\\": the falling chandelier, the masked ball, the journey to the rooftop, the voyage through the mirror into the labyrinth below.   <br /> <br />The odd thing is, although Leroux started out to write a plot-driven novel, it is a character which remains with the reader: Erik, The Opera Ghost.  What is unique about this, as a Gothic novel, is that the \\"monster\\" is the good guy.  Like Frankenstein's Monster, Erik is not evil - his sin is that he was born ugly.  He is described as looking like a \\"living corpse\\" without even a nose.  He is clearly a genius and would greatly enrich the world if only the world would accept him.  However, the world does not - his own mother forced him to wear a mask and would never kiss him.  Unlike Frankenstein's Monster, there is inhuman about Erik - he is simply ugly - and because of that, the world doesn't want what he has to offer.  So, he hides in the Paris Opera House to flee from persecution.  He is NOT, as several reviewers misread, a \\"serial-killer.\\"  In the end, it is Society - not the Phantom - who is the monster.  Erik's crime is that he refused to lie down and be victimized. <br /> <br />Of course, the real story is a love-triangle among Erik, Christine Daae - his young protg - and Raoul, the Vicompte de Chagny.  Although Raoul is supposed to be the \\"hero\\" of the tale, he ends up as a rather silly, ineffectual person.  It is the Phantom who loves Christine more.  He loves as Raoul cannot...unselfishly.  I find it interesting that Leroux does not let us know whether or not the happy couple stays together.  I believe that Christine comes to regret her decision.   <br /> <br />Because the \\"monster\\" is actually the hero, almost all the Hollywood versions have failed.  This is obvious because they re-cast the Phantom as someone who has acid thrown on his face, thereby exonerating Society of creating monsters.  The Lon Chaney version WAS the only one that mostly stuck to the book - therefore the audience doesn't know why it should be rooting AGAINST the Phantom.  Andrew Lloyd Weber is the only one who got it right.  Any fan of the musical should definitely read the novel. <br />	2004-12-02

Laurie Stone, the essayist and creative writing teacher, recommended this book to me as the most essential volume on the personal essay.  I could not agree more.  The editor, Philip Lopate, is one of the most well-respected authors of the personal essay and he has compiled this anthology of pieces from the classical era to the present.  The book works well for readers and writers alike.  Lopate, in his lengthy introduction, gives an overview of the personal essay, and instructions on how to use this book as a learning tool.  It is divided into several sections, beginning with the essay's forerunners in the classical period.  Michel De Montaigne, the father of the personal essay, gets his own section.  Personally, I did not find it useful to read the book cover-to-cover - I read it in reverse.  I started out with the most recent, contemporary essays - those most accessible to me - and went backwards in order to see the devolution of the essay, as it were.   <br /> <br />The essay is fast becoming one of my favorite forms - it is short, funny, and insightful.  I highly recommend this book to ANYONE.   <br />	2004-11-23

Regardless of plot, one can get lost in his prose style and simply enjoy living with the characters he creates.  The book is divided into three equal sections and the harshest criticism I have is that the last two thirds are not as good as the first. <br /> <br />There really is no plot to the book.  In the first section, we meet Eddy O'Hare.  He is sixteen-years-old and he is sent for the summer to be the writer's assistant of novelist Ted Cole.  Ted and his wife Marion have lost two teenage boys in a car crash, and this has left the wife irreparably damaged.  She begins an affair with the teenager as a means of saying goodbye to her sons.  Ordinarily, I would not be sympathetic to such subject-matter, and it is a testament to how good a writer Irving is that he pulls it off. <br /> <br />However, as the narrator explains, the story is really about the Cole's daughter - Ruth.  In the following two-thirds of the novel, we jump ahead thirty years or so to take up Ruth's story, leaving Eddy on the periphery.  However, this is a minor complaint.  Irving has such command of his craft that the reader is willing to follow him wherever he will lead - to the red-light district of Amsterdam and beyond. <br />	2004-11-15

He (somewhat arbitrarily) chooses the greatest wisdom writers of all time, and his perspective on their work is very illuminating.  He goes through the history of the western world and selects two authors from each time period.  The couplets are Job and Ecclesiastes (books, not people), Plato and Homer, Cervantes and Shakespeare, Montaigne and Francis Bacon, Samuel Johnson and Goethe, Emerson and Nietzche, Freud and Proust, and Thomas and Saint Augustine.   <br /> <br />Even though I highly recommend this work, I disagree with much of what Mr. Bloom has to say.  What makes it worthwhile is his invaluable commentary of the figures listed above - who they were, and the thoughts they express.  However, nowhere in the book does Bloom give us HIS definition of what wisdom is - and everything is judged by his own very personal standards. <br /> <br />Literary criticism is, by definition, subjective; and it is Mr. Bloom's own personal prejudices that may put some readers off.  In his defense, at least he is honest about his prejudices.  \\"I agree with absolutely nothing in The City of God, but then the book is not addressed to a Jew and a Gnostic.\\"  Mr. Bloom constantly reminds us that he is not a philosopher; so, in the battle between literature and philosophy, he continuously asserts that we prefer literature.  He considers Plato the greatest philosopher, but casually tosses him aside with preference to Homer, Cervantes, and Shakespeare. <br /> <br />In trying to decipher his criteria for wisdom, it seems to center on useful aphorisms.  It seems to be the reason he prefers literature rather than carefully constructed philosophical arguments.  I had a logic teacher who uses to disparage maxims as \\"bumper sticker philosophy,\\" and I think he has a point. <br /> <br />Also, in this stage in his career, Mr. Bloom has lost sight of who the true enemy is.  He continues a pointless and wrongheaded feud with Stephen King and J. K. Rowling as `enemies of literacy.'  Nothing could be further off base.  He writes that his criteria for reading are \\"aesthetic splendor, intellectual power, wisdom.\\"  These are not the only criteria - sometimes you just want a good story.  And, if I may be a philistine for a moment, I do think you can find a bit of wisdom even from Harry Potter, unless you are determined not to find it. <br /> <br />At a reading, Mr. Bloom said he should have included Kierkegaard, who keeps popping up in this book.  I think Kierkegaard would have illuminated much about wisdom.  It is not so much about saying that Plato is wrong and Shakespeare is right, but about one's own commitment to a belief system.  Bloom rightly points out that literature holds a mirror, not to nature, but to ourselves.  We find the wisdom in books that we are looking for.  Mr. Bloom's wisdom may not be yours.   <br />	2004-10-26

I have taken a class at the Gotham Writers' Workshop, and I highly recommend it.  My former teacher, Thom Didato, is one of the editors of this collection.  The purpose of this book is to give the reader (writer) an overview of the short story.  Sure, there are countless other anthologies of short stories out there, but those either reprint the same ones over and over, or they cater to specialized markets.  As it says in the introduction, \\"We've taken great pains to select stories that the general public will find gripping and entertaining.\\"  In other words, these stories qualify as literary fiction, but they are not pretentious or boring.  There are a couple of classic stories here, by such authors as Carver, Chekov, and Hawthorne; but it is mostly comprised of contemporary stories that are only a few years old. <br /> <br />This book is a valuable guide to the state of the modern short story. <br />	2004-10-19

James Joyce defined the modern conception of what a literary short story is; how they should be character-driven pieces which end in an epiphany.  How important then is The Dubliners, which features every short story Joyce ever wrote.  The prototypical epiphantic story is \\"Araby,\\" yet the best story in the collection is \\"The Dead,\\" which is really a novella. <br /> <br />As good and important as these short stories are, I wouldn't recommend the novice reading them cold.  Without an idea of who Joyce was, it will just seem that nothing happens in these stories.  Of course, one must realize that `nothing happening' is what these stories are about; how the Irish had become a paralyzed, enslaved society. <br /> <br />Yet, on a more important level, I would recommend getting a reading guide simply for the cultural references that the modern person shouldn't be expected to get.  There is a great deal of slang in The Dubliners.  The entire point of the story \\"Clay\\" will be lost unless one knows what clay signifies in the Irish Halloween ritual.  \\"Ivy Day in the Committee Room,\\" is almost indecipherable unless one knows the names of the figures of early twentieth-century Irish politics.  I actually used the Cliffs Notes for these and I found them very useful. <br />	2004-10-04

Augusten Burroughs claims that he wrote a story in college entitled, \\"My Childhood was More Screwed-Up than Yours.\\"  Chances are, he is right.  Taken on face value, the events in this book are too harrowing to make enjoyable reading.  Augusten comes from a severely dysfunctional and crazy family.  His parents happen to find a psychiatrist who may be the only person in the world crazier than they are.  Eventually, his father leaves them and his mother gives custody of Augusten to her shrink.  Dr. Finch's greatest danger is that he considers himself \\"spiritually evolved.\\"  He masks his perversity behind the faade of enlightenment.  One of his new ideas is to allow Augusten (age 12) to have a physical relationship with a 33-year-old mental patient.  Why shouldn't he?  He's allowed his 12-year-old daughter to move in with a man in his forties who beats her. <br /> <br />Burroughs often gets compared to David Sedaris, but his humor is of a different flavor.  A reader tends to develop a deep affection for the Sedaris clan and all their idiosyncrasies.  Reading Running with Scissors, all you want is for Augusten to get away - away from his psychotic, self-obsessed mother, and away from the lunatic asylum that is the Finches.   <br /> <br />Ultimately, what makes this book work is that it is not about victimization, but about survival.  Much like Lolita, Augusten becomes the one who holds the power in his relationship with the older man.  As he puts it, \\"I have a Ph.D. in survival.\\"  He tells his story with such energy and humor, that it becomes fascinating. It is a revealing look at just how disturbed the family next door can really be. <br />	2004-09-27

In these tales, King is mellowing a bit with age.  For instance, in the title story, the teenage protagonist is conveniently devoid of a sex-drive.  Are we really to believe that this is possible?  Yet, it helps to further the plot.  Many of the characters written about here are closer to King's current age.   <br /> <br />However, there is a lot of classic King here to keep his fans happy.  \\"The Road Virus Heads North\\" is a chilling tale (if a bit too reminiscent of \\"The Monkey\\") about a creepy painting.  \\"1408\\" is a pure, hard-core ghost story.  \\"Lunch at the Gotham Bar and Grill\\" ends up as a Hitchcockian suspense tale. <br /> <br />Some of the more interesting stories have to do with King taking riffs on the horror genre.  \\"L.T.'s Theory of Pets\\" is a horror story without the actual horror.  \\"Riding the Bullet\\" and \\"The Man in the Black Suit\\" are more about the effects of horror than the actual horror itself. <br /> <br />Very few people will come to this book who are not all ready fans of King.  Some of the stories will leave them flat, but the rest will surely make up for it. <br />	2004-08-23

In that book, Straub admits what an inspiration `Salem's Lot was.  Reading Ghost Story, one is reminded of `Salem's Lot.  This is not a haunted house story - these \\"ghosts\\" can go anywhere and seemingly do anything.  The entire town of Milburn is besieged by \\"ghosts\\" much the same way `Salem's Lot is by vampires.<br />The story is fairly creepy.  Five old men share a dark secret.  One day a mysterious woman comes to town and the horrors begin.  Anything more specific than that would be giving the fun away.<br />However, even though he is inspired by Stephen King, Peter Straub does not possess King's literary talent; his characters are two-dimensional and the writing seems curiously flat.  He lacks King's ability to conjure vivid images and people.  This is a bad thing simply because Ghost Story is a LONG novel.  Don't read it if you are looking for an intellectual treat.  However, if you are a dedicated horror fan, you will appreciate the scares within.	2004-07-14

It was after the publication of this book that King announced his \\"retirement\\" - he feels that he's begun to copy himself, writing ANOTHER EVIL CAR story.  Well, even so, From a Buick 8 is pretty good.  It isn't so much an \\"evil car story\\" as it is about State Police Troopers and the lives they lead.  <br />One day, twenty years ago, someone (an alien) abandons what seems to be a Buick at a gas station in western Pennsylvania.  The police confiscate it and soon discover that it isn't a car at all.  The central conceit of the book is how the police (unforgivably, if you ask me) keep an alien machine to themselves, despite how dangerous it is.<br />King has mellowed with age.  His characters are older and more sedate.  The story itself is fairly laid-back, although terrible things do happen.  However, it doesn't have the kinetic energy of King's early work, and I think that is what the negative reviews are responding to.  It is still a good, scary book however.  King has not lost his touch for characterization or creating a richly detailed and researched world - you feel you know what it is like to be a State Trooper at the end of this.  If you are a Stephen King fan, you will enjoy this novel.	2004-07-13

There are a lot of things going for this book that make it a fast, funny, and moving read.  The central conceit of the story is that it is told in the first-person from the perspective of Christopher, a fifteen-year-old autistic boy.  Christopher's brain is organized in a way that makes him incredibly good at math and logic.  His favorite novels are mystery novels (because they are logical and can be solved) so, when he discovers his neighbor's dead dog one night, he decides to solve the crime and write a mystery novel about it...and this is that novel.  Because Christopher thinks in pictures (and because Mark Haddon is an illustrator) there are illustrations throughout.  Of course, the reader can put the clues together faster than Christopher, and we have a better idea of what is going on than he does.  More important, we are given a glimpse inside the mind of an autistic child: how he thinks, how he feels, and why he does the things he does.  We cannot help but feel for the likeable Christopher - his motives are so clear, why can't other people understand him?	2004-06-29

For any serious fan of horror, Stephen King's Danse Macabre is an invaluable book, right up there with Lovecraft's Supernatural Horror in Literature.  To use a rough analogy, it is as if Hitchcock wrote a book on suspense (actually, Truffaut's interviews with him amount to just that).  Some of the negative reviews I've read on this site claim that King is too digressive.  Well, it is digressive - the paperback clocks in at just over 400 pages - but Stephen King is not an academic, and he does not write like one.  For me, that made this scholarly work all the more readable and enjoyable.  (I am a King fan, so my opinion is biased).<br />The stated goal of the book is cover Horror from 1950 to 1980.  However, he cannot do this without turning to the horror \\"heavy-hitters\\" of literature - Dracula, Frankenstein, and Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde.  According to King, these books define the three archetypes (he calls them \\"Tarot Cards\\") of horror - the Vampire, the Thing with No Name, and the Werewolf, respectively.  (There is a fourth card for the Ghost or the Bad Place, but that can't be narrowed down to one book.)<br />He discusses movies, books, and television.  What is refreshing is how critical King is - even about his own novels.  He has bad things to say about a lot of popular works - he will annoy fans of The Exorcist, The Twilight Zone, and other popular books.  But, as any lover of horror movies must admit, King opens up about his love of bad movies and even finds nice things to say about the movies, The Amityville Horror and The Prophecy.  (I am also shocked about how many nice things he has to say about Stanley Kubrick and The Shining - a film he supposedly doesn't like.)<br />Fortunately, I had read most of the books and seen most of the movies that King discusses.  He also provides invaluable appendices for further reading and viewing.  What is of tremendous interest is King's analysis of his contemporary writers, who have been so gracious as to discuss their own works with him.  Here we find the best commentary ANYWHERE on Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison, and Richard Matheson.  King also tackles the questions of why we read horror and if it has a deleterious effect on society.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANY HORROR/FANTASY/SCI-FI GEEK!!!	2004-06-28

We first meet Alex in the seventies when he is six years old and we follow him to his early twenties.  There is no real story to the novel - it is merely a collection of episodes forming a sort of Bildungsroman.  To say the least, Alex is a morally ambivalent character and he is not always likeable.  The book's title and its blurbs lead one to believe that it is more risqu than it actually is.  Yet it is well-written and provides a good look into the life of a young, educated, Manhattanite.	2004-06-21

Early on, it becomes clear that he is the \\"unreliable narrator\\" in the Edgar Allen Poe sense.  The Chief may be faking deafness, but it is obvious through his descriptions that he is a schizophrenic who suffers from hallucinations.  It is up to the reader to sort out the \\"real\\" from the \\"imaginary.\\"<br />Although Broom and his fellow inmates are insane, they are still good people and they do not deserve the treatment they receive at the hands of the evil Nurse Ratched.  She is one of the most memorably evil villains in all literature.  Even though she is only a nurse, she is in complete control of the entire hospital.  What she wants is for everything to run like clockwork.  She does not want anyone to ever \\"get better.\\"  In walks Randall Patrick MacMurphy.  Like Hamlet, MacMurphy fakes madness (in order to get out of a labor camp).  He soon sets himself up as the ward's personal savior (there is a lot of Christ imagery) and engages in a war with Nurse Ratched.<br />This is a great book that is really about non-conformity; the tyranny of people who dictate what is \\"normal\\" and what is not.  The only flaw is a strain of misogyny that runs through the subtext.  There is a lot of talk of how men shouldn't be bossed around by women and how they should be kept in their place.  Granted, this is the characters speaking and not Ken Kesey, but the message is there.  After all, this is a book that culminates in an act of violence against a woman.  It's a shame because it is a great book and just because Nurse Ratched is evil, there is no need to extend the message towards women in general.	2004-06-19

Different Seasons is perhaps the best Stephen King book with which to initiate the neophyte who says, \\"He can't be a good writer - he writes HORROR.\\"  This is King's first, greatest take on the mainstream.  Each of the four offerings could be textbook examples of the perfectly written novella.  Not coincidentally, this book has inspired three of his best movie-adaptations.<br />Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption:  Yes, even if you have seen the movie, you should read this.  It tells the story of how an innocent man is able to keep hope alive in prison.<br />Apt Pupil:  This, it can be argued, is really a monster story; the monsters however are all too real.  A teen-aged boy obsessed with the holocaust discovers his own pet Nazi in the neighborhood.<br />The Body:  The inspiration for the wonderful film Stand by Me, it is a heartbreaking coming-of-age tale and the power of friendship.<br />The Breathing Method:  The book's one true horror story.  I won't try to attempt to explain what it is about.<br />In the Afterward, King commits his worst sin by famously referring to his own work as \\"the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and a large fries from MacDonald's.\\"  Not only does that cut himself short, it is an insult to us, his readers, who think his stuff is pretty darn good.  Want proof?  Read these stories.	2004-06-13

This is his second published (after Carrie).  Here, we find King's writing style to be young, energetic, and a bit rough around the edges.  (I have just finished reading On Writing and he would agree that there are a bit too many adverbs.)  As always, King creates characters and a story that pull the reader along at breakneck pace towards the conclusion.<br />`Salem's Lot is one of the few truly great vampire novels ever written.  Stephen King calls it a \\"literary homage.\\"  It is a deliberate fusion of the novels Dracula and Peyton Place.  This book is written for those who know their way around vampire stories.  When King visits all the set-pieces of vampire fiction - the stakings, the vampiric girlfriends, the Renfield-like familiar - he is doing so deliberately, giving us his modern take on them.  The vampire king, Kurt Barlow, is much like Count Dracula - and like Dracula is effective because he spends most of his time off-stage.<br />If elements of this book seem dated to modern readers, I don't think that is necessarily fair.  This was written in the mid-seventies - before vampires became the heavy-hitters of modern horror fiction.  There was no Vampire Lestat back then - and no Buffy either.  If King was writing this today, I think he'd skip the obligatory scene where the Van Helsing character says, \\"Those marks on the neck!  This is the work of a VAMPIRE.\\"  \\"A vampire, but that can't be!\\"  Vampires are so much a part of our daily lives I don't think it would even surprise us anymore to meet one.  King keeps the pot boiling however (as he always does) with verisimilitude, strong-characterization, and his natural story-telling ability.  <br />(By the way, there are two companion short stories to this novel King has published elsewhere - Jerusalem's Lot, and On the Road.)	2004-06-05

If he dismisses him out of hand - \\"No, I've never actually READ anything by him, but I've seen the movies,\\" - I know the guy isn't worth his salt.  Stephen King - along with Elmore Leonard - is one of the best craftsmen of fiction alive.  MANY authors higher up the food chain would do well from taking some lessons from him.<br />Now they can.   In On Writing, Stephen King gives us what advice he can on the subject of writing fiction.  The problem with many creative writing books is that they are not nuts-and-bolts enough; they provide esoteric clichés like \\"write what you know.\\"  Stephen King cuts to the practical matters, like follow Strunk &amp; White and avoid adverbs.<br />The book is half advice on creative writers and half autobiography.  The autobiography is germane because we want to know how the most successful author of modern times got his start.  Here we see a man who PAID HIS DUES.  I've read this book three times now and I may do so again - I find it endlessly useful.  If you can, get the audiobook; it is narrated by King himself and much more of his personality comes across.	2004-05-30

I thought I'd love it.  For a while, I did love it - I was on the verge of recommending it to friends.  Then, about a hundred pages in, it got tedious.  I realized that this is a one-note novel.  Alexander Portnoy keeps saying different versions of the same thing over and over again.  His rant (this book is simply one long rant) ceases to be insightful or illuminating or even funny - he just becomes ANNOYING.  Hundreds of pages of kvetch, kvetch, kvetch.  Not for nothing, ALL parents mess their children up.  To have this guy in his thirties still blaming his poor parents for everything that is wrong in his life - and with such gravity - simply makes him a loser.  <br />That is the book's critical flaw - Alex Portnoy is not a likeable character.  I hated spending time with him - he's obnoxious.  He goes on and on about how noble he is, how liberal, how enlightened, how smart, how educated, how moral, yadda, yadda, yadda.  This does not stop him from spouting countless racial, anti-religious, and homophobic stereotypes.<br />I can't understand why this book is as well-respected as it is.  Maybe it was original at the time it was published; now it just comes across as DATED.  And I consider myself its target audience too!  Similar material has been mined with better results in film by Woody Allen - and even on television by George Costanza!  <br />I know this review is not going to be popular - this book is a bit of a sacred cow.  I just couldn't finish it.	2004-05-30

The only comparisons I can draw are to films like Dead Poets Society or Scent of a Woman - that whole genre set at rich boarding schools.  The obvious comparison is to Catcher in the Rye, but the tone of that novel is entirely different.  The thing that sets this novel off is the moral ambiguity of the narrator, Gene.  At first, we sympathize with him but then he commits an unforgivable act.  If we sympathize with him the rest of the book, we sympathize with his sense of guilt over doing something he cannot forgive himself for.  Gene's fall from innocence is mirrored by America's fall during WWII.  This is a heartbreaking novel, capturing the joys and horrors of youth that stay with you your entire life.	2004-05-19

It was at the end of his career - and his life.  It was a strange evening; he was obviously at the end - he couldn't remember the words to his songs or read the teleprompter.  Few people left however - the evening soon became about us - his fans - letting him know that we still loved him.  \\"I LOVE YOU FRANK!\\"  a huge, middle-aged, rough-looking man yelled out during a pause.  Sinatra, taken aback by the violence of the outburst, chuckled and replied, \\"I love you too, pal.\\"  As Pete Hamill once pointed out, \\"Seeing Sinatra in ruins is like seeing the Coliseum in ruins - it's still magnificent.\\"<br />Why Sinatra Matters is a must-read for any Sinatra-phile.  In the Overture, Hamill cites Sinatra's death as the impetus for writing this book.  He saw all these young reporters from MTV and VH1 doing stories on Sinatra (obviously prepared in advance) telling the world Sinatra was important, without really understanding why.  It certainly wasn't just because he did it \\"his way.\\"<br />This is a very short book.  As Hamill points out it is not a \\"definitive biography\\" - although once he was in talks with Sinatra to write just that.  It is, as the title plainly states, an explanation of why Sinatra matters - artistically and culturally - and why he always will.  In terms of Culture, Hamill reminds the reader of a time when America felt it was morally obligated to persecute Italians - Sinatra helped change all that.  Musically, the reasons are more complex.  To put it succinctly, no one ever sounded like Sinatra before.<br />The book is great because it also sheds light on Sinatra the man, who is often lost in the obscurity of his own public image.  He was not just some gruff tough guy - a kind of idiot savant who could churn out a great recording in one take.  He was a fiercely intelligent, well-read, well-cultured, self-educated man who worked hard at his craft.  The most enjoyable parts of the book are the conversations Hamill recounts between himself and Sinatra.  Most shocking of all - to me at least - was to imagine Sinatra using the F-word!	2004-05-16

THIS IS A BOOK FOR PEOPLE AT ALL LEVELS - LAYMAN, COMPOSER, OR ADVANCED MUSIC LOVER.  \\"Why should one have to learn or need guidance on how to listen to what one is hearing?\\" is the question that William Schuman asks in his Preface.  \\"The answer is simple.  Listening to music is a skill that is acquired through experience and learning.  Knowledge enhances enjoyment.\\"  <br />What makes What to Listen for in Music so invaluable is that it is the ONLY book on musical appreciation written by a GREAT COMPOSER.  \\"This is a composer's book,\\" Aaron Copland states.  \\"Given the chance, every composer would like to know two very important things about anyone who takes himself seriously as a music lover...1. Are you hearing everything that is going on? [and] 2. Are you really being sensitive to it?\\"<br />The only shortcoming of this book is that it should be taken as part of a class to make sure that one gets everything out of it.  It would be great if it came with a CD of all the examples to which Copland makes reference.  However, each chapter does end with a list of \\"recommended listening.\\"  To make specific points, Copland does include sheet music (but I didn't read this book sitting next to my piano).  However, these problems are minimal, considering we live in an age of the cheap CDs and music downloads.<br />Copland covers EVERY aspect of music, starting with \\"how we listen,\\" - on the sensuous plane, the expressive plane, and the sheerly musical plane.  He then goes on to explain to us the Four Elements of Music - Melody, Rhythm, Harmony, and Tone Color.  We find out about all the musical instruments, their history and classifications.  We find out about all the genres in music - Sectional Form, Variation Form, Fugal Form, Sonata Form, Free Form.  Did you know that Sonata Form includes symphonies as well?  And that symphonies grew out of operatic overtures?<br />This is a book that bears re-reading.  A lot of technical jargon gets bandied about and, although Copland doeshis best to explain it all, it still gets a tad confusing.  I advise reading this book, listening to a LOT of music, and then reading it again.  I know my own knowledge and appreciation of music has grown from reading it.  Now I DO have an idea of the nuances I should be listening for in a Mozart piano concerto.	2004-05-06

Every time I read something by George Orwell, I'm convinced what a genius he was.  This novel, along with 1984, is so entrenched in our collective consciousness now that it is difficult to remember a time when they didn't exist.  I think that political extremists on either side would like to subvert Orwell's message for their own purposes.  What makes Orwell great however is that he is not simply skewering the left or the right, but politics itself.  To paraphrase Woody Allen in Sleeper (his take on 1984) \\"It doesn't matter who is in charge - they're all terrible.\\"<br />Historically, Animal Farm was written as a polemic against Soviet communism after Orwell returned from fighting in the Spanish Civil War.  Even though the USSR is his main target, Animal Farm reads like a blueprint for every violent revolution ever.  I'm also reading a book on the French Revolution, and I'm amazed at how much the two link up.  First comes the idyllic phase when the oppressors have been overthrown.  Next, the \\"liberators\\" soon set themselves up as demi-gods.  Next comes marshal law.  Eventually, it does become impossible to distinguish the men from the pigs.  \\"All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\\"<br />This book, written before 1984, introduces some of the themes that Orwell will do much to develop later.  For instance, like Big Brother, Napoleon - the leader - gradually does away with the animal's history and memory.  He gradually alters the Seven Commandments of animals, while maintaining they were \\"always\\" that way.  (\\"We are at war with Eastasia.  We have ALWAYS been at war with Eastasia.\\")<br />This book is so spot-on in its depiction of human (animal) behavior its scary.  Whenever Napoleon institutes another sacrilege, the \\"sheep\\" are quick to shout down any opposition with their cry of \\"Four legs good, two legs bad.\\"  Inevitably, this becomes, \\"Two legs good, four legs bad.\\"  Four legs are bad, four legs have ALWAYS been bad...<br />If you were forced to read this in school, or haven't read it in a long time, give it another chance.  It's extremely short and you'll enjoy it.were forced to read this in school, or haven't read it in a long time, give it another chance.  It's extremely short and you'll enjoy it.	2004-05-03

OK, first off, skip the ENTIRE BEGINNING SECTION of this book - it is perfectly pointless today.  In it, Hobbes is basically trying to do away with the concept of an immortal soul, thereby creating an atheistic society that cares nothing for religious matters.  Hobbes is NOT known for his Philosophy of Mind.<br />What everyone remembers about Leviathan is Hobbes' terse, cynical, and on-the-money observation that life is \\"nasty, brutish, and short.\\"  Of course, what he means by this is life in the State of Nature.  In order to try to make life a little better, man comes together to form societies.<br />So far, so good.  What most people take exception to is the kind of Social Contract that Hobbes endorses.  Hobbes says that a society should come together to form a Social Contract in which everyone is OBEY THE SOVEREIGN UNCONDITIONALLY NO MATTER WHAT.  Here's the kicker, the sovereign or king himself exists OUTSIDE OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT AND IS NOT BOUND BY IT.  In other words, the sovereign can do whatever he likes and the people must obey his commands no matter how cruel or ridiculous.<br />Now, Hobbes was really trying to be more reasonable than he sounds.  He lived at a time when England had spent years torn apart by constant war.  He was also a self-professed coward: \\"Fear and I were born twins.\\"  Basically, what he wanted was an end to war at all costs.  For him, that meant obeying a STRONG RULER - in his case, Oliver Cromwell.  The second section is addressed to the people trying to make them understand why this is in their best interests.<br />The last section is addressed to the sovereign himself.  Yes, he says, you can be a tyrant and do anything you want, BUT that will only cause you more trouble than it's worth.  I have some advice for you to follow.  Hobbes then goes on to RECOMMEND ways in which the sovereign could be a good ruler.<br />In the end, Hobbes thought he was being an eminently practical man.  To him, the \\"natural rights theorists\\" would just be talking nonsense.be talking nonsense.	2004-05-01

This is a valuable historical document, because it shows us the thinking that led up to the French Revolution.  Rousseau wrote: \\"Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains.\\"  What Rousseau means by this is that Man is born free in the State of Nature - it is society, government, and urban life that are the corruptive forces.  Without those things, Rousseau argues, man would exist in peaceful co-habitation.  What is striking to the modern reader about this claim is how blatantly wrong it is.  Rousseau was trying to refute Thomas Hobbes who wrote that the State of Nature is the same as the State of War.  Apparently Hobbes got the better of the argument because, as soon as the French Revolution took effect, peaceful liberty went out the window in favor of the Reign of Terror.<br />But, back to Rousseau.  He claims that, even though men in nature peacefully co-exist, it is more beneficial for them to come together to form a society.  Thus they SHOULD come together and form a Social Contract.  The ideal contract for Rousseau would entail the individual GIVING UP ALL HIS RIGHTS on entering the contract with the understanding that he will get them all back from the Sovereign.  Who is the Sovereign?  Well, for Rousseau, the Sovereign is the People.  If Rousseau's Ideal State were an organism, it would be a large one-celled organism with no differentiation.  This is very much unlike Hobbes' Leviathan, with the Sovereign at the head and each part assigned its individual task.  For Rousseau, only the SOCIETY AS A WHOLE has the right to govern.  <br />Of course, this system is incredibly unwieldy, that is why - in Rousseau's world - there are a whole bunch of little city-states, like ancient Athens.  HERE COMES THE SCARY PART.  Once the whole population gets together and makes a decision, that decision is infallible.  \\"THE GENERAL WILL CANNOT BE WRONG.\\"  Those minorities who are disaffected by this general rule shall be \\"FORCED TO BE FREE.\\"  In the case of the French Revolution, that was the freedom of one's head from one's shoulders.<br />According to Simon Schama in his wonderful book, Citizens, the importance of the Social Contract has been overestimated.  Rousseau's love of the State of Nature (which was the spirit of the French Revolution) had more of an effect on the public through his novels Emile and La Nouvelle Heloise.<br />The Social Contract must be viewed in its historical context as a piece of history in itself.  If one reads it for philosophic reasons only, it will come of sounding either frightening or painfully naïve.  One sentence caught my imagination however - Rousseau saw the island of Corsica as the perfect candidate for his ideal state.  \\"I have a presentiment that this little island will one day astonish Europe.\\"  It did.  It produced the greatest warlord the world had ever seen - Napoleon.	2004-04-26

This is, quite simply, one of the finest modern plays ever written for the theater.  If you think you don't have to read it because you've seen the movie, think again.  They RADICALLY altered the stage play for the screen.  The film may look better - but most of the brillance of Peter Shaffer's incredible dialogue is lost.  Some of it still remains in the scenes where Salieri is an old man.  The play, however, is almost a dramatic monologue delivered by Salieri.  Shaffer has an uncanny knack for dialogue and this is his second best play next to Equus.  The funny thing is, even though they gutted the text for the film, the film is actually much LONGER than the play.  If you liked the movie, have any interest in Mozart - or any interest in great plays, for that matter - read Amadeus.	2004-04-20

This is the middle story in Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy and, while it is good, it is impossible to say that it is as good as The Crystal Cave.  Perhaps this is just because that not much happens in this part of the Arthurian saga.  The events in this story concern what happens to young Arthur before coming king - in other words, it covers the same ground as The Sword in the Stone, but it is less fun.<br />The action picks up with Merlin taking the newborn Arthur away from his parents, Uther and Ygraine, at Tintagel.  He then deposits him with Sir Ector and goes off on a trip to Europe.  The main invention of this novel is how Mary Stewart comes up with a different version of the Excalibur story (here referred to as Caliburn).  In a manner of speaking, Arthur does take the sword from the stone, but not in the way you'd expect.  <br />This book made me want to read the next one - perhaps because I know in the next one, more things will actually happen.  This episode is kind of laid back and inert.	2004-04-12

John Morris's The Age of Arthur is an excellent reference guide for anyone interested in the historical Arthur, or the Dark Ages in general.  It's as old as I am and I found it in a used book shop.  At more than six-hundred pages, it is incredibly detailed and a bit hard to read cover-to-cover, but you can get the gist of it with some judicious skipping.<br />Some historians may have trouble with the conclusions that Morris draws.  He relies heavily on folklore as his source.  His thinking is, if there's smoke there's fire - if all these chroniclers write about a King Arthur who lived during the time of their fathers, then there's probably some truth to it.<br />As far as I can tell, the majority of historians (including Simon Schama) believe that there was a warlord named Arthur - he was the last Brit to fight off the Saxon hoards.  The details of his life and the character of the man are unknowable.  Morris would agree with that - he doesn't give us details of Arthur's life.  There are snippets provided from historical writings - some of which portray Arthur as a tyrant.  There is a Vortigern in this book, but no Merlin.  Who knows how true Morris's assertions are, but in all fairness, like Herodotus, he does provide his source materials so you can make up your own mind.	2004-04-07

My favorite is The Once and Future King by T.H. White because of the style in which it is told - it is done with a tremendous amount of humor and charm with its tongue occasionally in its cheek.  The tone of this compilation of novels is very similar to the tone of I, Claudius.  Here, Stewart writes in the voice of Merlin - and that tone is very serious.  Her main source is Geoffrey of Monmouth.  She gives a modern-day, realistic re-telling of the events.  She takes pains to make everyone into a three-dimensional character.  All the familiar plot-points are there as well, but Stewart makes them more modern.  It's true, Merlin is psychic, but he uses science more than magic - although he creates magical myths about himself.  For instance, the myth of his being sired by an incubus is created to conceal that he is the illegitimate son of King Ambrosius.  When he transforms Uther to look like the Duke of Cornwall, he uses a disguise, not magic.<br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable read for any Arthur enthusiast and it is a great piece of literature in its own right.

The Canterbury Tales were almost ruined for me by my freshman English Lit class.  They insisted on making us read it from The Norton Anthology of Literature, which of course is untranslated.  This is pointless.  Unless one is a specialist or going for a doctorate there is no point in reading The Canterbury Tales in Middle English with all those endless footnotes.  It takes one of the greatest books in English Literature - or World Literature, for that matter - and makes it torture.  I have no need of \\"thilke\\" or \\"willhem\\" or \\"clepen.\\"  That is why Nevill Coghill's translation is such a boon.  Now we can enjoy it in our own language the way the fourteenth-century English did (in truth, it is not that hard to translate as many of the words stay the same).  I have taken to reading it, not as a novel, but as a collection of short stories - skipping around as I please.  I think it is agreed that the best parts art the Miller's Tale, The Pardoner's Tale, and The Wife of Bath (and the Prologue, of course) which makes for excellent starting points.	2004-04-07

It is difficult to separate the novel from the myth of LeRoy himself.  It is autobiographical fiction, but I'm not exactly sure where the autobiography ends and the fiction begins.  LeRoy was a fourteen year old street-hustler whose therapist recommended he turn to writing in order to deal with his issues.  He was put in touch with figures in the literary community, such as his hero, Dennis Cooper.  He was first published at 16 and at 19 he wrote the novel Sarah.  <br />The book reveals a world I never knew existed (and now that I know, I'd like to forget).  Apparently, there is quite a trade in child prostitution for truck drivers in West Virginia.  The narrator is just one of those characters.  Pre-pubescent, his mother Sarah is a prostitute and soon he (known as Cherry Vanilla) is indoctrinated as well.  (This is nothing new to him as his mother's Johns have been molesting him as well.)  The wrinkle is that he has to dress up to look like a girl.  The story does bare a resemblance to Oliver Twist - instead of child pickpockets, they are child prostitutes.  However, the drama of this story merely entails the escape from the \\"bad\\" pimp to the \\"good\\" pimp.  <br />Don't expect an overly happy ending for the book, but at least we know LeRoy's own life is turning out better.  If you are interested I highly recommend viewing his homepage at [...] to get a better understanding of him (there is some speculation as to the veracity of his claims).  LeRoy is now friends with many people in the entertainment industry and both his books are being made into movies.<br />I was troubled with some of the cavalier blurbs on the book, as if it were a lighthearted romp.  True there are funny moments but the world described is hell.  I had trouble sleeping at night considering the implications of Sarah.  Anyone who's seen Mystic River knows that victims of child abuse never really escape.  If the author of this book really went through something like this, then the powers of human healing are truly miraculous indeed.	2004-04-06

This is, by far, the best telling of the Arthurian Legend - yes, even better than Geoffrey of Monmouth or Sir Thomas Mallory.  White makes the story new again by infusing it with strong characterizations and humor.  The story is told in twentieth-century dialogue, making all the characters seem witty, urbane, and intellectual.  Each one is given his own personality.  Lancelot, for instance, is rendered totally human.  He might have a beautiful body, but he has an ugly face.  The reason he tries to act so virtuously is that he is convinced he isn't a virtuous person.<br />The book is a compilation of four separate books, bound together.  The first, The Sword in the Stone, is a children's book, but an adult would have to be seriously jaded not to enjoy it.  There is a lot of overt humor, in-jokes, and even an appearance by Robin Hood.  Afterwards, the novels take a more \\"adult\\" and \\"realistic\\" feel.  White does his best to make these icons seem like real people in real situations with real motives.  He even allows time to pass and his heroes grow old, instead of staying eternally young as they do in other versions.<br />The primary source White bases this on is Le Mort D'Arthur.  When I learned more about the history of Britain, I realized that White had fused the Arthur story with the story of Henry II.  Arthur is supposed to have lived around fifth century.  White transposes the story to the twelfth century.  He acknowledges this by claiming that Arthur was real and Richard the Lionhearted was fake!  The deeds he attributes to Arthur - like the creation of the English law system - was really the work of Henry Plantagenet.  It is only fitting because Henry always saw himself as King Arthur.  Apparently, T.H. White sees him the same way.	2004-04-04

I read the text of Beowulf in this edition before reading the introduction.  I had never read Beowulf before and I wanted to come to it fresh.  Taken on its own, as a novice, it is a rollicking good read.  First off, it is very short - you could get through it in about one sitting.  It gets right into the heart of the matter; the monster Grendel (a cursed descendent of Cain) is about the countryside killing people.  The hero Beowulf comes from Sweden to Denmark to fight him.<br />Of course, this is an Old English fantasy poem so there are times when you have to meet it on its own terms.  For instance, either drowning did not exist back then or Beowulf could hold his breath indefinitely because the underwater fight between him and Grendel's mother lasts for nine hours.  This is one macho man!<br />The translation by Seamus Heaney moves along at a brisk pace.  The Anglo-Saxon text is on one side of the page and the English is on the other.  He provides little chapter headings at the side of the page.  There are no annoying footnotes.  He provides a long introduction acquainting us with the text and why it is so important and why it should be considered a work of art in itself and not merely interesting for historical reasons.  He credits J.R.R. Tolkien's essay as helping people appreciate it in a purely literary way.  Indeed, this is one of the prime influences upon Lord of the Rings; the plot is different but the monsters, names, and manner of speaking will ring a bell.<br />What I enjoy most about Beowulf is the sense of being transported back in time to Anglo-Saxon England.  This book is a living piece of history and Heaney's translation makes it remarkably fresh.	2004-04-03

Like other books I was forced to read, I was predisposed to dislike it.  Compelled reading is rarely fun - especially when the book has a \\"message.\\"  Coming back to 1984 all these years later, I am struck not only by how spot-on Orwell is in his analysis of human society, but what a good read the book is in its own right.<br />There is a tendency to be snobbish in literature.  1984 CAN'T be a science fiction book because science fiction books are trash.  1984 is not trash, therefore it is not science fiction.  This is Orwell's principal of \\"doublethink\\" in action.  Not only is 1984 science fiction, it is the best dystopian novel ever written (I would place Fahrenheit 451 in second place - something about books with numbers in the title).  Orwell vividly creates a nightmare vision of the future more realistic than anything we've seen before.  The future in London does not look advanced because technology has stopped.  The telescreens are the only omnipresent gadget.  Instead London looks like what it is - a destroyed Victorian England.<br />It is hard to come to 1984 fresh because so many of the terms Orwell invents have become iconic: Big Brother (is watching you), Three Minutes Hate, Doublethink, Newspeak, Thoughtcrime, The Thought Police, and Room 101.  I won't go so far as to say that 1984 is coming true - in many ways, humanity is going in the opposite direction - but it is unsettling how many things are coming true.  Are there not TV screens everywhere and don't they watch us as much as we watch them.  Revisionist historians are all around and, as the Party says, \\"who controls the present, controls the past.\\"  Is modern politics possible at all without Newspeak and Doublethink?  In Iraq, until recently, it was the face of Sadam Hussein that was everywhere watching everyone and that face bears a remarkable resemblance to Big Brother.<br />It's easy to equate the Party in 1984 with our current government,but I think that is a bit too simplistic.  What makes Orwell more than merely a liberal is his pessimism about everyone.  \\"The only reason for power is power.\\"  It doesn't matter who is in control - it is all doublethink.  What makes 1984 truly great is that we are not given a happy ending.  Orwell is not a humanist - humanity doesn't stand a chance against the Party.  Instead, our vision of the future is \\"a boot stepping on a human face-forever.\\"	2004-04-01

This is unfair because he is also America's best new novelist.  Nobody has any business writing novels and short stories equally well.  This is Chabon's first collection of short stories and it is not quite as good as his subsequent collection, Werewolves in Their Youth, but it is still excellent.<br />The book is divided in halves - A Model World and The Lost World.  Ultimately, the second half of the book is better because it is a series of connected stories about Nathan Shapiro, a boy growing up and dealing with divorce.  <br />If anyone is interested in the craft of short story writing, A Model World is a model collection.	2004-03-29

Another reviewer accuses Eggers of \\"forcing\\" his tastes on the reader.  I must be one of the lucky few who Dave Eggers did not force to read this book at gunpoint.  The title of this book is \\"Nonrequired Reading\\" - by definition, you are going to find pieces which are off the beaten path.<br />Personally, I found this book an invaluable tool to judge the state of modern writing.  This is the only \\"Best American\\" collection I own, and I think it is the most valuable.  Whereas this one gets criticized for being \\"too hip\\" the others strike me as being too high-brow or revisionist.  This collection shows what people ACTUALLY READ.  <br />The story behind the book is that Eggers has a team of literary-minded high school students cull the best of everything they've read from the entire year.  The works contained in this collection run the gamut from fiction, to journalism, to humor, to essays - it even includes a comic strip.  What makes this book so indispensable for any aspiring writer is not only that it gives an idea of the current voice of writing and the new young authors who are writing it, but it also lists the publications where one can find them.<br />Among the new authors that this book has helped me to discover is the very young J.T. Leroy.  The author of Blackhawk Down provides an incisive and disturbing biography Saddam Hussein.  The always dependable David Sedaris provides a very funny account of his brother Rooster's wedding.  <br />I would have felt I got my money's worth from the book if I had just read the forward by Eggers (the part we were supposed to \\"skip\\").  Eggers is one of the best, freshest voices in writing today.  Even better is the introduction by Zadie Smith where she provides guidelines of \\"how to read\\", complete with a lot of useful quotes from literature.	2004-03-29

Another reviewer claims that you have to be at least 21 years old to read this book.  Although I don't think it should be \\"forced\\" on schoolchildren (they will only hate it) I read this novel when I was a child and I loved it.  I have just re-read it now and I enjoy it all the more.  This is my favorite novel by Dickens.  It is from his later period and is criticized for being too dark - which, however, makes it more perfect for today's sensibilities.  Stephen King cites this work as one of his favorites: he believes that it is this book that brought the gothic novel mainstream.<br />Was there ever a novelist who created more memorable characters than Dickens?  Here, we meet perhaps his most intriguing - Miss Havisham.  For anyone unfamiliar with the story, I will not spoil it by describing her.  The story is similar to parable about the prodigal son - good Pip inexplicably comes into some money and goes off to the corrupting city.<br />AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE:  Dickens wrote two ending for this book.  His friends thought that the original ending was too downbeat and they asked him to come up with a different one.  It is the upbeat ending that is the official ending of the novel.  However, most critics agree that the original unpublished ending is better.  Most modern editions feature the unpublished ending in an appendix.  MAKE SURE YOU BUY A COPY THAT CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL ENDING!	2004-03-26

I highly recommend the Signet Classics edition of this play, translated by Eric Bentley.  He provides a wonderful opening essay, as well as Pirandello's own forward.<br />The plot, I'm sure you know, involves six characters who stumble upon a theater rehearsal.  They are not so much looking for an author as a play in which to exist.  Pirandello breaks the fourth wall as no other author had before him.  It is a very daring and original piece.   A must for any serious student of drama.	2004-03-16

This is a great mystery novel - probably Sherlock Holmes' best - and a good thriller in its own right.  Arthur Conan Doyle creates a genuinely creepy atmosphere by his setting on the English moors and the legend of the demonic hound.  Of course, being a Holmes story, most things end up with a rational explanation, but there is good, honest, Victorian terror along the way.  Reading it, I was struck by how much it must have influenced the movie, An American Werewolf in London.<br />Conan Doyle has a wonderful, economic prose style and his Holmes stories always move at a quick pace.  The only maddening thing is how much time Sherlock himself spends off-stage.  I guess Conan Doyle treats the character the way most authors treat villains - only allowing the reader glimpses of him.  I guess that is because Sherlock's mind is so atypical, he is ultimately unknowable to us.  In this story, Holmes has to stay behind in London for a while, so he sends the very competent Dr. Watson to Baskerville hall to investigate the strange goings-on.	2004-03-15

This is the first Sherlock Holmes novel and the perfect place to begin reading his literature.  Forget about the movie clichés of Holmes and Watson - here you meet them for the first time.  Watson - far from a bumbling fool - is a military doctor just returned from Afghanistan.  An old acquaintance reluctantly suggests looking for a room with a school chum of his who is a bit odd.  We first meet Sherlock Holmes as a graduate student.  He's very brilliant - the only thing is nobody can figure out what he is studying or what he does.  The two chums become roommates and the rest is history.<br />Seeing Sherlock Holmes anew, he is reminiscent of a positive version of Hannibal Lecter.  Both of them are able to detect anything about a person at a glance - or a whiff.  Each have encyclopedic knowledge of medicine, psychology, and everything else you can think of, and both are intellectually vain.  Sherlock likes to show off and is downright childish in taking pleasure in how clever he is.<br />The book starts off great - introducing the characters and getting right to the heart of the matter.  It continues at a nice place until the half-way mark where Conan Doyle (who had not yet mastered the art of the novel) interrupts the dramatic action for a flashback.  That aside, it is still a great read and you can probably get done with it in one sitting.  I HIGHLY recommend the Vintage Classics edition with an introduction by Ann Perry and footnotes, the latter proved an invaluable addition.	2004-03-12

That's fair enough - Baxter references it himself in the book.  I admire any writer who can write about philosophy so effortlessly while not being boring.  As soon as one of the characters claimed to be obsessed with Kierkegaard, I was hooked.<br />Yes, this book is a feast of love.  It is about romantic love in all its aspects - young and not so young.  The most adorable couple in the book are the teenagers Oscar and Chloe (pronounced \\"Klow-Ay\\").  They are just punks who spend most of their time having sex, but their dreams are surprisingly traditional.<br />Don't be scared off if you think that a book about love is going to be sappy - it isn't.  Baxter breathes life into all of his diverse characters.  We come to feel for them - their dreams, their fears, and their frustrations.  When tragedy finally strikes, we are so involved we become heartbroken too.  <br />Baxter writes in an interview style, effectively giving us multiple first-person narrators.  The conversational writing quickly hooks the reader and moves him briskly along.  It is like an Altman film - there is no central character, just an interesting journey into the lives and loves of these Midwestern people.  A very good read.	2004-03-07

Reading this book confirmed what watching the TV show made me suspect - I have no idea how to run my own life.  This is the book every mother should give her son before he moves away to college or gets an apartment of his own.  Life is full of stuff we all are SUPPOSED to know but nobody ever tells us about.  Why was there never a guidebook before?  As soon as the show started, I wondered when the Fab Five were going to write down their accumulated wisdom.<br />The book itself is kind of a coffee table book - expensive and heavily illustrated.  Each of the five writes his own section which covers the basics in every area of expertise.<br />TED:  What tools you need in your kitchen.  When to buy produce.  How to make cocktails.  He tells you to NEVER smell the cork.  There are a whole bunch of recipes in this section as well.<br />KYAN: I never had that &quot;how to shave&quot; talk with my dad - probably because he doesn't know how himself.  Kyan tells you how.

You'll find out what to look for in a suit, what kind of clothes you should own, how to buy jeans, and the all-important pocket-square.<br />JAI: He has the hardest job on the show because he has the most nebulous job description.  Yet, he does come up with a lot of useful tips for his section - how to shake hands properly, how to be the perfect party host/guest, and how to go on a date.<br />Every section is pretty funny and it makes a good reference book to keep coming back to.	2004-02-21

The road may go ever onward but, for us at least, the journey is done.  It is difficult not to be emotional arriving at the end of Return of the King after making it through the entire trilogy.  The thing about this particular book, for me, is it seems much such shorter than the other two.  At least half the number of pages are devoted to the Appendices.  The Two Towers had brought us so far that all that remains in Return of the King is climax after climax.  Here, Frodo and Samwise's journey through Mordor is much more arduous than in the movie.  It is in the third installment I think that we get the despair that Tolkien felt coming home from the Great War.  He, like Frodo, must have found it impossible to pick up the threads of his old life.<br />Like the movie, there is a very long denouement after the climax of the story.  You may think it is over, but we have to find out what happens to all the characters.  Peter Jackson left a lot out of the film - especially what happens to Saruman and the Shire.<br />Now that it is over, I realize who my favorite characters are by who I will miss.  Oddly, I don't miss any of the Men.  Aragorn, for all we are told we are supposed to love him, falls rather flat on the page.  Yeah, he is heroic, but I can't relate to him.  I will miss Gandalf - he was fun.  Legolas and Gimli are too thinly drawn to have any true love for them.  Ultimately, Lord of the Rings is the hobbits story.  They have personality.  I feel for Frodo and the task that has been thrust upon him.  I feel I know him and Samwise.  That is the true statement the books have to make about heroism - you don't have to be a super-human like Aragorn.  As Gandalf says, \\"you just have to do the most with the time that is given.\\"<br />It's sad to watch your friends sail off into the sunset, but ultimately, that is the only way the book can end.	2004-02-16

His sentences are like melodies and, like Nabokov, it is easy to simply get carried along by their flow.  He does not write \\"novels\\" in the classic sense - he writes \\"pieces\\" which have just as much to do with philosophy as creative writing.  The journey is all about little insights, philosophical ideas, and musings on history.<br />I must warn the newcomer, however - this is NOT a straightforward novel.  This is a classic example of \\"metafiction\\" - that is, writing about writing.  The book begins with Kundera seeing a woman's wave which inspires him to write a story.  Immortality is that story, PLUS Kundera's writing that story, PLUS random digressions about Goethe and Rubens.  I have to impress upon the reader that THERE IS NO PLOT in this book.  That is Kundera's point, and yet the absence of a plot does not encourage the reader to keep going back to it (as it is not headed anywhere).<br />If you are looking for a book that is out of the ordinary, with very poetic philosophical digressions, than this is the novel for you.	2004-02-01

By the time one gets to The Two Towers, after traveling through The Fellowship of the Ring, one feels quite at home in Middle-earth.  Unlike the first novel, where the action is fairly linear, this second installment of The Lord of the Rings is divided into two books.  The first chronicles Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they try to rescue Merry and Pippin, meet the king of Rohan, and fight the battle of Helm's Deep.  The second half jumps back in time to follow Frodo and Samwise as they try to make their way into Mordor.<br />I enjoyed this book even more than Fellowship - possibly because there is more action in it.  Also, the story feels more compressed, as it deals with a relatively short amount time (a month, perhaps?) whereas Fellowship told a leisurely story that occurred over several months.  Once again, as I read, I was convinced that the point of these books is not to arrive at the end of the tale, but to simply enjoy the journey.  Because Tolkien is so good at his job, and has created a fully-realized world with three-dimensional characters, it is easy to understand how so many readers have come to lose themselves in the books.<br />At this point in time, I cannot not talk about the movies.  If one comes to this book AFTER SEEING the films, one will realize that Peter Jackson played around with endings.  The beginning of the book The Two Towers is actually the end of the movie The Fellowship of the Ring.  Also, the adventures in this book take us far into the movie, The Return of the King.  I was pleased to find this out because the Hobbits' encounter with Shelob is one of my favorite parts in the story.	2004-01-24

What is there left to say about The Lord of the Rings?  I believe that, on this very website, the trilogy was named the best novel of the twentieth century.  Now that the movies have come out, everyone is familiar with the story.  It is unfair to come to the books for the first time now, with so many expectations built up.  As good as the book is, it is still only a book.  Frodo will not leap off the page, put his arm around you, and make you feel good about yourself.  I fear people will be disappointed.  Also, there is a very large contingent of people who HATE Tolkien.<br />So where does that leave us?<br />I have just finished reading The Fellowship of the Ring for the second time.  For me, it was more enjoyable reading the book AFTER I'd seen the movie.  Middle-earth is such a complex universe that it is easy to get lost.  Do not read these novels if you are fixed on getting to the ending.  Here especially, the journey is the thing.  LOTR is about going places, meeting people, and having new adventures.  The movies told this story from a modern vantage point - emphasizing action.  In the book, the action is not as prevalent.<br />I had the opportunity of traveling to Oxfordshire recently (Tolkien's old neighborhood) and I had the feeling that I was traveling to Middle-earth myself.  That is the feeling Tolkien wishes to convey.  He loved nature, loved traveling, and he wanted to write a book that expressed his love.  I think the book succeeds admirably.  To be sure, there is enough magic and monsters to hold your attention as well.<br />Come to this book on its own terms.  Get ready for a nice leisurely read.  Don't expect a transcription of the movies and you won't be disappointed.	2004-01-14

It is neatly broken down into sections so you can refer to it for sightseeing, dining, or clubbing.  I stuck mostly to the pubs myself and, while not rated, the book lists the best, most historic pubs to visit.  <br />Even though it is a book on London, the book also covers the other cities that are a good day trip away.

There are the occasional flaws in this novel.  The writing occasionally veers dangerously from the fancy to the fancy-shmancy.  In his strive to be original, he has the characters say things and express philosophic viewpoints that strain credibility (even though it is a completely surreal novel).  There are passages which could be subtitled \\"Author's Viewpoint Coming Through.\\"<br />This is obviously a debut novel.  Most of the books flaws stem from that fact.  On the other hand, so do its virtues.  Everything is Illuminated pulls out all the stops the way only a debut novel can.  Whatever flaws it may have one can easily forgive because of the sheer energy with which the book is written.  I do not think readers will be bored.  Also, the device of having the book written in two different voices - the one commenting on the other - works very well.  Alex, the Ukrainian voice, is very funny without being condescending.  <br />Johnathan Safran Foer is an author to watch; he may have many more great works in store for the future, judging from this book.  Considering that he wrote it when he was only twenty-one is all the more inspiring (or irritating, depending on how jealous you are).   <br />I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book and I highly recommend it.  It includes an interview with the author at the end.	2003-12-17

I bought this book about ten years ago; it was the text book in an undergrad Creative Writing class.  It wasn't until last year that I really read it.  I have just finished reading it again for the second time.<br />I think that all of Gardner's advice for beginning writers is valid.  I was shocked at the negative reviews that some other readers have posted.  They find fault with Gardner because he makes reference to classic works of literature.  First off, one does not have to have read EVERY book that Gardner makes reference to in order to understand his point.  <br />What shocks me is that people seem genuinely offended that Gardner thinks that aspiring writers should read!  EVERY creative writing teacher expects his students to read as much good literature as possible.  Why is this?  Because IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE A GOOD WRITER UNLESS ONE IS WELL READ.  You don't believe me - just ask Stephen King.  If you are offended that Gardner expects you to be familiar with names like Hemmingway and Faulkner, you should be ashamed of yourself.  <br />The elitism argument isn't even supported by the text.  Sure he talks about Homer and Shakespeare, but he also comments that great writing can also be found in Spider-Man comic books and other unlikely sources.  (I am comforted because the negative reviews themselves are not very well-written.)<br />These are dangerous times we live in.  People no longer want to hear that they can't just pick up a pen and be the next Fitzgerald.  And who's to say that Fitzgerald is any better than James Paterson, say?  It's all relative, is it not?  <br />It is not.<br />This is a book for the serious writer - for ANY writer who wishes to write better.  In order to do that, one must do the work.  If this book makes writing sound like a hard thing to do, that is because WRITING IS A HARD THING TO DO.  If it is not, you are doing it wrong.<br />Gardner covers all aspects of fiction techniques: plot, style, genres, voice - everything a beginningwriter NEEDS TO AT LEAST CONSIDER.  If you don't like this book, find another book on the art of fiction...but I fear you will have the same reaction.  Any creative writing book worth its salt will offer the same advice.	2003-12-10

The Goblet of Fire is about as long as the previous three Harry Potter books put together.  I was worried going into this that the magic would run out - that Rowling might have been caving under the pressure of having to produce a Harry Potter book each year.  Some of the reviews I had read suggested as much.<br />Well, the magic is still going strong.  True, this is a long book (we do not arrive at Hogwarts until around page 200), but, like Harry, I want to spend as much time at Hogwarts as possible.  The story is just as engrossing here as in the previous novels.  This, in fact, may be my favorite so far.<br />The story concerns a contest amongst several schools of wizardry.  The book begins with Lord Voldemort so I don't think I'm giving too much away by saying he has something interesting planned for Harry in the tournament.<br />This is darker than the previous two books.  The similarity with Lord of the Rings becomes more apparent.  As Harry grows up, circumstances become more and more dire.  I have not yet read Order of the Phoenix, but I am looking forward to it.	2003-11-26

For anyone unfamiliar with Leonard's work, this is a good introduction.  We get a good display of his range here.  There is a western story, a story set in a retirement home, and oh yes, stories about criminals.  Nobody writes stupid characters better than Elmore Leonard.

As soon as you begin Wild Seed, you know that you are in the hands of someone who knows what she is doing.  I was turned onto Octavia Butler by reading Orson Scott Card - who cites her in his book on Writing Science Fiction.  The book is, in the best sense, literary.<br />The story reads like a version of the X-Men set in the past.  Imagine Dr. X forced to marry Magneto.  Doro and Anyanwu are both immortals.  Anyanwu can die, but she goes on living indefinitely.  Doro dies quite frequently - merely inhabiting a new body the moment he does.  Therefore Doro cannot die.  He finds the shape-shifting woman Anyanwu in Africa in the seventeenth century and brings her to one of his \\"seed villages\\" in America.  There, he has gathered other mutants with special abilities for the purposes of breeding them in the hope that he may, one day, produce another mortal like himself.<br />Butler avoids many of the clich&eacute;s which science fiction and fantasy are prone to.  The resultant novel is a thoroughly enjoyable read with memorable characters.  Things are not resolved by a tidy little shoot-out at the end.<br />My problem with the mass-market paperback is that, in several places, there are glaring errors: lines are repeated, etc.  Wild Seed deserves a better edition.	2003-11-17

Although both of Dave Eggers' parents die in the book, the book is not depressing.  Both deaths happen off-stage.  What he is most concerned about is the aftermath - Eggers, 22, is left responsible for the care of his nine-year-old brother, Toph.  The two of them move out to California where Eggers begins a magazine.  The thing everyone comments about the book that it is gimmicky.  It is.  It famously has a forty page manual on how to enjoy the book, complete with a sketch of a stapler.  My favorite gimmick however, is the way Eggers draws attention to his own gimmicks.  Toph frequently \\"breaks character\\" to pass sophisticated judgments on his brother and the way he is writing the book.<br />There is too much that I loved about the book for me to mention.  I loved the relationship between Toph and Eggers.  It is not a melodramatic, party-of-five thing.  Eggers loves his brother.  He loves the opportunity to mold another person.  He loves doing stuff with his brother.  He looks at him like a roommate.  My favorite scene is where Toph momentarily forgets that he is eleven and not twenty-two.<br />I love that this is a chronicle of the nineties - which, I guess, is my generation.  There is a great section of the book dedicated to Eggers involvement with The Real World TV show.  Remember Puck?  Even he makes an appearance.<br />As with any great book, you read AHWOSG and occasionally think, \\"I thought I was the only one who felt that way.\\"  The book is a very fast read.<br />My only occasional problem is the self-hatred Eggers sometimes shows.  He attacks himself for mining his own misery - which is what every writer does, especially the comic ones.  It's OK - he's allowed.  We are all tired and we are all true of heart.	2003-10-10

An important bit of information to know is that the format of this book is a \\"coma diary\\" written by a woman to her husband.  It is NOT a book written in the second-person, despite the liberal use of the word \\"you.\\"<br />The book starts like all of Mr. Palahniuk's books do, with plenty of interesting trivia.  In this case it's about art history, human anatomy, and graphology.  I won't go into to the plot of the novel - which is impossible to describe - but it fits into the category of \\"one sane person in a town full of crazies.\\"<br />The best part about reading a Palahniuk novel isn't the story, but all the interesting asides and digressions along the way.

This is the last Chabon book that I've read (even though it was his first) and he consistently proves himself a genius in my eyes.  The only negative thing I ever hear anyone say about Chabon is that there's not really a plot to his books.  That is not the point!  He is simply a joy to read - extremely funny and moving at the same time.  The story, as it is, concerns Art Bechstein: the son of a gangster.  One explosive summer, he falls in with a Hemmingway-esque crowd of beautiful people.  Together, they discover their \\"will to bigness\\" and have many amazing adventures together, until it all comes crashing down.  <br />I believe that this is Chabon's shortest novel.

It is the first modern novel ever written.  It is also one of the longest - although, I don't see how it could be any shorter.  The novel is actually two novels stuck together.  Cervantes published the first half, which became an incredible success.  Years later, he published the second part which relates the third salley of the Don.  The effect that this has on the book is that all the major characters in the Part II have all ready read Part I, making the book incredibly self-referential.  Cervantes also has fun in mocking a spurious Part II by another author that was published at the time.<br />I do not speak Spanish - let alone 17th Century Castilian, so I was forced to read the novel in translation.  I have never read another version, but John Rutherford's Penguin Classics version was satisfactory in every way.  He does his best to retain Cervantes' humor, which is the most important aspect of the novel.  Also, modern audiences my benefit from translation because it puts the book into the modern language - making a four-hundred-year-old book read fresh.<br />As for the plot, a country hidalgo named Alonzo Quixano spends his time reading chivalric romances.  One day, he decides to become a knight errant named Don Quixote (Sir Thighpiece).  He convinces a simple neighbor who speaks in proverbs, Sancho Panza, to come along with him to be his squire.  Quixote is crazy and Sancho is a fool - except that they seem to be preternaturally sane and wise when the chips are down.  If you are only familiar with Man of La Mancha, the book is drastically different.  Dulcinae never actually makes an appearance.  Sancho is traveling along because he has been promised the governorship of an island - and he gets it!  They just spend the book wandering around and getting into adventures.  Personally I prefer the second part of the novel (the first is too digressive).<br />Allow yourself some time, and enjoy this masterpiece of Western Literature.n Literature.	2003-07-16

At his best (The Watchmen, Miracleman) he pushes the limits of the genre philosphically as well as artistically - questioning the very foundations of comics and superheroes.  This may not be Alan Moore's best work, but it certainly is entertaining.<br />Basically, this is The X-Men set in Victorian England and populated with characters from Victorian literature.  In actuality, this is what comics were made for - creating an alternate universe where the Invisible Man and Mr. Hyde get together to do some damage.  It is pretty-much a straightforward adventure story, told with Alan Moore's cynicism and wit.  The artwork is much more mainstream than I am used to in the typical Moore story, but don't worry - there's plenty of blood and guts.<br />I have not yet seen the movie, but I'm pretty sure the book will be better.	2003-07-10

Most critics laud the style in which it is written as unique, enviable, etc.  I don't know if this brands me as an anti-intellectual, but I was completely put-off by the style.  Call me old-fashioned, but I don't think that style should ever get in the way of clarity.  MacCormack's prose is poetic but it runs on and on like a vast river tumbling endlessly into the wilderness where all the animals look on and ponder why anyone would want to write sentences like these that run on for pages and pages and don't stop no matter how much you want them to or how lost you are in the story without even having the decency to give us a comma or a quotation mark or any type of punctuation whatsoever and just keep connecting words using the word and on and on until you think you cant ever read the word and again.  Give me good old Stunk and White English every day.  Having made my way through the whole book, I don't think I got everything that was going on, but that is not my fault.  However, just when things are getting boring, you are treated to over-the-top, Grand Guignol, gory, gratuitous violence to perk up your interest.<br />The story, such as I can make out, concerns a 14-year-old boy, know simply as the kid.  The kid is tough beyond his years and sets out on his own.  He finds himself in the Southwest where he joins a band of outlaws, led by the diabolic judge, who kill Indians for their scalps.  Even though this book is a \\"western\\" (it takes place mostly in the 1840's) it doesn't take place in a West I am familiar with.  Blood red deserts stretch endlessly under blood red skies.  In fact, I'd argue that the book really takes place in hell, because this is not even the earth I recognize.  It is sophistry to argue that the judge is not a supernatural character.  The judge is completely hairless - no eyebrows even - and spends much of the book wandering around naked.  He is seemingly omniscient and immortal.  He may be a manifestation of the Devil himself.  This theory seems to be true from the first moment the party discovers the judge, sitting on a rock in the middle of an inhospitable desert with no tracks around him, to the very end of the book, which I didn't completely understand (it seems almost the end of the poem The Raven).<br />There are things in the book I admire, but I can't really recommend it as pleasurable reading.  I can honestly say that I have no intention of ever reading one of MacCarthy's books again.	2003-05-21

What about plot-driven stories?  Despite what many critics would have us believe, it is the plot-driven story that sticks in our mind.  The spirit of the book is to gather some of today's best authors and have them give the old plot-driven story a go.  The results are hit and miss.  I greatly enjoyed &quot;Megalodon&quot; and &quot;Tears of Squonk&quot; as well as the offerings of Nick Hornby and Elmore Leonard.  Surprisingly, the masters of the plot driven stories - Stephen King and Harlan Ellison - offer lesser efforts (in Ellison's case, he merely reprints an old story instead of writing a new one).	2003-05-21

Having read Henry V, I think I can sum up the plot as follows: the French insult King Harry, Harry get royally ticked-off, goes to kick some French butt, and comes home with a damned saucy wife.  Right now I enjoy any play that shows a contemptuous French government getting smacked down, but this play is not numbered among Shakespeare's heavy-hitters.  For one thing, King Harry is not a very interesting character.  In fact, I can't stand him - he is a faithless, glorified basher of heads.  Shakespeare knows this, that's why he only struts around giving rabble-rousing speeches.<br />There is a host of other colorful characters in the play (such as Ancient Pistol) but Henry V suffers in comparison with the two parts of Henry IV because of the absence of Falstaff.  Falstaff is the most interesting character in the Henriad.  By this time, King Harry has treacherously banished Falstaff and he has died of a broken heart.  Therefore, there is no cynical commentary in Henry V.  If Falstaff had been around, he would have completely undermined King Harry's posturing.<br />The induring legacy of the play seems to be the films made of it by Olivier and Branagh.  Ironically, these are two of the best films made of Shakespeare - partially because the play is so direct and accessible.  It is a short, brutal piece about war.  King Harry is so good at making speeches, most readers miss Shakespeare's subtle judgement on his central character's hypocrasy.	2003-05-11

Next to the Bible, it is the greatest piece of literature of all time.<br />I think that the signet edition is the best.  It has its usual introduction on Shakespeare and his times.

Each of Shakespeare's plays receives it's own chapter of commentary.<br />What is important is to read the introduction.  Bloom bemoans the decay of the intellectual tradition.  He celebrates Shakespeare (rightly so) for his own sake and not as merely interesting historically.  To Bloom, Shakespeare is the greatest writer of all time.  His shocking central theory is: Shakespeare INVENTED personality.  Not simply how we look at personality - he created it as a concept.	2003-05-04

I thought, \\"Holy cow, this guy is describing me!\\"  Considering Rob, the narrator of High Fidelity, that is not a good thing.  We even have two of the same books on our Top Five (Red Dragon, and The Big Sleep).  Rob is always making top five lists.  The book opens with his top five break-ups of all time.  Rob has just broken up with Laura and is doing the top five list to put his life in perspective and try to figure out how his life went so, so wrong.  Hornby hits the nail head-on as to what guys are like and how they think.  As such, Rob may not be a likeable character all of the time.  He is actually very reprehensible in some respects.<br />Rob's whole life is CD's.  He owns a CD store.  I have the feeling he would hate me if he ever saw my CD collection.  He would hate most of us if he saw our CD collections.  He runs the kind of store where customers are booted out for requesting a copy of Stevie Wonder's \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You.\\"<br />This is a very funny book.  Hornby is full of great observations about modern life and relationships.  The main fault of the novel however is that there is no plot.  I often found myself not being pulled along with the story, simply because there wasn't one.  When I put the book down I didn't feel a NEED to pick it up again.  However, when I did pick it up, I laughed.	2003-05-01

Dashiell Hammett describes private-eye Sam Spade as \\"a blond Satan.\\"  The description applies to more than just the detectives physical description.<br />I once heard James Ellroy claim to have been heavily influenced by Hammett, while not caring for Chandler.  I think I understand that now.  Ellroy's fiction contains no good guys.  In fact, goodness itself seems absent from his world.  He gets that from Hammett.<br />Chandler's Philip Marlowe is always the lone good guy in a world filled with corruption.  Spade is not a good man - he is demonic - but, like Satan, it is his lot to dispense justice.  He doesn't care a lick that his partner is killed - why should he?  He is having an affair with his wife.<br />Hammett is also as eloquent as Chandler.  The novel is filled with unforgettable characters like Cairo, Gutman, and even the black bird itself.  The dialogue is classic noir: one can quote Spade like Shakespeare.  The novel is as good a taut thriller as ever written.  It, along with The Big Sleep and Double Indemnity, and the best works in the genre.	2003-04-20

The problem with thesis-country is that it tends to be boring.  I think that the spirit of the book is the very personal feelings that Hamlet invokes for Harold Bloom.  While I do not agree completely with Bloom's interpretation of Hamlet, it has given me much to consider.  Without question, Bloom does prove that Hamlet is eternal, and will continue to be studied, puzzled over, and - most importantly - enjoyed.	2003-04-20

Why can't I be so incisive?  The purpose of Atonement is to turn that notion on its ear.  In this novel, the characters think they know what's going on, but none of them are right.<br />The actual plot of the book is incidental: a little girl sees stuff and misunderstands it (or does she?).  What's interesting is that Briony (the central character) is a future author whose books will just be about how individuals perceive things differently.  Well, this is a book where everyone perceives things differently.  Motivations and actions are completely misunderstood.  We travel in and out of the different minds in the story to understand how each of them are mistaken.<br />As for the actual story, it takes place in World War II Europe.  There is a memorable description of the British retreat to Dunkirk.  It creates a very vivid picture of what England was like up to and during the war.<br />Nothing expected happens.  I groaned when I came to the bit about the note, because I thought I knew how it would pay off.  I was wrong.  There is kind of a surprise ending, which is all the more strange in a book that denies the basic principals of plot.  McEwan's elegant prose makes for a very engrossing read.	2003-04-08

In The Hours, Michael Cunningham accomplishes a great feat by interweaving the true story of an author, Virginia Woolf, her book, and the people it influences.  Mrs. Dalloway (as yet unread by me) depicts a day in the life of one woman.  This book echoes that formula by showing one day in the lives of three different women living at three different times.  Perhaps ironically, the book is written in the present tense.  Cunningham's prose is wonderful and the book is a very addicting read.<br />And yet...<br />There is a great deal of negativity in the novel.  These are the most judgmental characters in literature.  They are impossible to like because they have unkind thoughts for everyone and everything they encounter.  Cunningham is almost Seinfeld-like, the way he agonizes over the minutia of daily life.  A character is condemned because he wears a baseball cap past the age of forty - who is he trying to kid?  I kissed him on the cheek and not the lip - what kind of impression did I give?  Is it immoral to buy flowers - were people exploited in picking them?  <br />However, unlike Seinfeld, none of these characters have a trace of humor.  I can't help but wonder, at times, if these characters are not insightful but merely neurotic?  They are ready to rebuke their fellow human beings for peccadilloes so trivial that a healthy person wouldn't even care.  Virginia Woolf can't even smile at her husband's assistants because she's traumatized by the thought that she will seem to be taking sides.  These character's can't even say \\"I love you\\" because it is a literary cliché.  In reality, these people are probably incapable of love.<br />No wonder the pall of suicide hangs over so many characters.  They cannot understand, even for a moment, that their cynical, post-modern observations may be...wrong.  <br />I don't care what they say, I won't live in a world without humor.	2003-03-31

James:<br />He is excellent!  He is one of the best, most underappreciated voices in horror.  Lovecraft admired him.  His stories, though old, are quite scary.  Also, they are very well written.  As Chabon points out in his intro, Poe and Lovecraft weren't the best literary stylists.  Most people cite &quot;Oh, Whistle...&quot; as James's best story, but I think I'll vote for &quot;Count Magnus.&quot;  Certainly all of them are good.  More than that, they are REQUIRED reading for anyone who wants to have a basic understanding of horror literature.  It is also a hell of a good read.<br />Second, this edition:<br />I was greatful to a previous reviewer for explaining the asterisks.  There are asterisks without footnotes all over this book, as well as other Oxford University Press books (The Monk).  Now we know that these are residue from a previous edition that HAD footnotes.  Perhaps you might want to get that version.<br />However, I take great issue with the disparaging of Michael Chabon's essay on M.R. James.  If you don't get the edition with his introduction, I recommend going to the bookstore and reading through it anyway.  His comments are very illuminating on James and ghost stories in general.	2003-03-27

If you do, it will give the whole plot away.<br />Although not as famous as Dracula or Frankenstein, this is a must-read for any serious Gothic horror fan.  One of the things that makes this book different is that (unlike Dracula) there is no proactive villain.  We kind of admire Dracula because (pardon the expression) he makes no bones about what he is.  Dracula is a villain and he's OK with that.  The Monk is a re-active villain.  His crime is that he's a hypocrite.  He finds himself committing crimes because he is week, not strong.  Therefore, one cannot admire the Monk the way we can admire Frankenstein's monster.<br />It is surprising how shocking the novel is, considering when it was written.  It has a very cynical - some would say \\"modern\\" - assessment of people.  The Monk's main motivation is sex.  Actually, sex is everywhere in the book.  It is obvious that it was written by a twenty-year-old who could not, even for a moment, imagine a vow of celibacy.  As the first novel of a boy barely out of his teens, Lewis pulls out all the stops as only a novice can - even bringing in the Devil himself, at the end, to dispence justice.<br />The plot is convoluted beyond belief, sub-plots and backstories abound, as well as other outmoded conventions of Gothic literature.  That having been said, this a briskly-written book.  It never bores.  Despite being over two-hundred years old, it is very accessible and sufficiently gruesome to interest any modern horror fan.  As for being anti-Catholic, I think \\"Monk\\" Lewis ends up sounding surprisingly pious.  By condeming the hypocrites, he affirms the values they are supposed to represent.	2003-03-24

It is a monumental achievement.  It is written by a man with a deep love of comics.  Even if comic books are not your thing, you'll still love this book.<br />The story opens with Sammy Clay - a streetwise dead-end kid from Brooklyn - sharing a bed with Joseph Kavalier, his refugee cousin from Prague.  Sammy is a struggling teen-age writer and amateur artist.  Joseph is an exceptionally gifted artist and magician.  Immediately, Sammy sees the oportunity to form a partnership.  Together, they create The Escapist - a smash-hit comic book character from the Golden Age.<br />Now, exactly what their amazing adventures are is difficult to relate and impossible to predict.  The book echoes the shoddy treatment that all comic book artists received back in those days - especially Siegal &amp; Schuster, creators of Superman.  Although they are plagued by disaster, the story is not a trajedy.  It is a journey through New York...and a world that no longer really exists.  Chabon takes us through it with the skill of a master.  It is not a short book, but by the time you reach the end, you'll be sorry you can't tune in next week for the continuing adventures of Kavalier and Clay.	2003-03-13

For me, it is up there with Great Expectations and David Copperfield as one of his most enjoyable novels (A Christmas Carol is a short story).<br />The social axe that Dickens had to grind in this story is man's injustice to children.  Modern readers my feel that his depiction of Dotheboys Academy is too melodramatic.  Alas, unfortunately, it was all too real.  Charles Dickens helped create a world where we can't believe that such things happen.  Dickens even tell us in an introduction that several Yorkshire schoolmasters were sure that Wackford Squeers was based on them and threatened legal action.<br />The plot of Nicholas Nickleby is a miracle of invention.  It is nothing more than a series of adventures, in which Nicholas tries to make his way in the world, separate himself from his evil uncle, and try to provide for his mother and sister.<br />There are no unintersting characters in Dickens.  Each one is almost a charicature.  This book contains some of his funniest characters.<br />To say this is a melodrama is not an insult.  This is melodrama at its best.  Its a long book, but a fast read.	2003-03-08

I just re-watched the movie (which is one of the better King adaptations, by the way) and I realized why so many King movies turn bad: King movies are about scary things - the books are about people, who scary things happen to.

First off, this book isn't primarily about Christmas - only the second chapter is.  The movie takes several chapters of the book and sets them all at Christmastime.  The book is much more bleak than the movie.  There really isn't a story.  Ralph, now a newspaperman in the 1960's, goes back to his hometown to write an article.  The whole book takes place in an afternoon of telling stories with Flick, who now runs a local bar.  In the book, everywhere is the reality of the Depression and the bleakness of the Midwest.<br />I'm glad I read the book.  I recommend it.  But I have to say that this is one of the instances in which the movie is actually better.  I was genuinely sad to find out the fate of poor Schwartz.  To me, I will always think of this story in movie-form: of Chinese Turkey, of Flick's tongue stuck to the telephone poll, and Ralphie saying \\"FUDGE!!!\\" (Only he didn't say \\"fudge\\").	2002-12-02

To be honest, I knew that it would be unrealistic of me to try to plunge into a 1,400 page novel.  In glancing through the introduction to the unabridged version, even scholars consider it digressive and longwinded.  I opted to read the abridged version instead.<br />The result?<br />I feel I have an idea now of the story, yet I am not sure I have really read Les Miserables.  What is lost in the story, what is considered extraneous, is a lot of the background and the character definitions.  I would have liked to have spent more time with Gavroche.  I'm still not sure how the July Revolt started or why or how Marius was involved.  We skip most of Fantine and her suffering.  A lot of the questions remain unanswered.<br />What we have left is the plot.  That is enough for me to recommend this book.  I would have never have read it otherwise.  I think I have an idea now of Hugo as an author and Les Miserables as a novel.<br />Some day however, I'll read the whole thing.	2002-10-24
US	52606675	R2ZTFJGBZYXRAO	0691017840	638703862	The Hero with a Thousand Faces (Bollingen Series, No. 17)	Books	4	95	101	N	N	A New Hope...	Joseph Campbell is a \\"love him or hate him\\" type of guy.  The other reviews of his works that I have found on Amazon bear this out.  The criticisms seem to be that his examples do not bear out his theories, that he relies on Freudian and Jungian psychology as \\"proof\\", and that people do not agree with his world-view.  My response is this: we must bear in mind that Joseph Campbell was, above all things, a pioneer.  A pioneer need not get everything right the first time out - he is setting up a new paradigm with which to view the world.  Freud did not get everything right when he fathered modern psychoanalysis, but he created a new framework and steered it in the direction it needed to go.  <br />The Hero with a Thousand Faces is a comparative study of the religions and myths of the world.  Its central theme is that all of their stories are essentially the same.  They follow certain archetypal paths that are different in particular circumstances, but in general, follow the same overall arch.  Now, this is not 100% true as even he admits - stories get changed around a bit and different things happen, but to the extent that he makes his point, the similarities are astonishing.  His conclusion - or ONE possible interpretation - is that this reflects certain archetypal themes that are in every society's collective subconscious (Jung) and that these myths represent eternal truths about life...how to look at it and how to live it.<br />Now, as to the criticism that his examples don't bear out his theories, Campbell states that he is just choosing an example or two to illustrate his point.  The purpose of this book is not to be a comprehensive collection of the world's myths - that book is The Golden Bough.  Campbell selects myths that the average reader may not be familiar with.  While sometimes similarities may not be immediately apparent, it is open to disagreement as any essay on literature is.  Campbell warns though that these myths must be ready as poetry, not prose -so beware of any callow analysis.  Personally, I would have like his using more familiar myths - especially Arthurian legends - to illustrate his point.<br />As for his seeming to rely on Freud and Jung as gospel, that is a bit dated.  Even so, the fact that his theories do jibe with Jungian psychology is significant - if not actual \\"proof\\" that he's right.  And as for disagreements with his world-view, that is irrelevant.  Campbell has developed a framework with which to view the world; you do not have to draw the same conclusions from it that he does.  Campbell did not believe in a personal God, and I believe he is wrong about that.  But the underlying message to me is that, even though people may have divergent beliefs about religion, the underlying ideas and values of religion ARE DEMONSTRATABLY TRUE.<br />Campbell goes through each stage of the hero's journey, with all its variations.  This is meant not only as academia but it is for YOU - the READER.  This is how one views one's own life.  These ancient stories were not just for entertainment - they showed us how to live.  That's what this book is for.	2002-07-08

Reading it now, it doesnt seem that erotic to me  thats not the point.  Yeah, theres sex in it, and plenty of dirty words, but the descriptions dont get that graphic.  If you read Sexus, theres a lot more of that going on  if thats what you are interested in.  I suppose that Tropic got its reputation for being the first of its kind and the thing that stood out in most peoples minds was the sex.  Reading it in todays overly-saturated-with-sex culture, the things that stands out the most to me are the bedbugs, lice, feces, etc.<br />Miller is trying to do something radically different in this book  to create a new art form.  It isnt even a book, according to him; it is a prolonged insult, a gob of spit in the face of Art  It is ultimately a song, he says.  There is no plot, no linear storythere arent even chapters  just anecdotes and opinions of Millers life in Paris ejaculated all over the pages.  He wants to give priority to all the things that other novels pretend dont exist: sex, going to the bathroom, uncleanness  watching a whore use a bidet before sex.  To Miller, these carnal aspects of life are the realities and should be the subject of art  not love, romance, or war.  He tries to give an accurate portrait of what it was like to be a peasant in Paris in the early 20th century  the cold reality of the fantasy of Moulin Rouge!<br />In the end, Millers works are a triumph of style over substance.  For him, the style IS the substance.  Its difficult for me to remember anything that actually HAPPENED in the book  what I remember is the piece of lead with wings on it.	2002-05-02

However, the worst novel by Dickens is better then most author's best.  This is a great work and when I think of The French Revolution and The Reign of Terror, it is A Tale of Two Cities that I usually imagine.  Also, it contains two of the most famous passages in all of literature: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...\\" and \\"It is a far, far better thing I do now than I have ever done...\\"  It is a great novel to be sure, but it should not be your INTRODUCTION to Dickens.	2002-04-18

Therefore, while the actual PLOT of Moby Dick is a fairly straightforward read, Melville will digress for pages and pages about whales, and the history of whaling.  This may not prove that interesting for everyone and, since the chapters are all neatly labeled, one can easily skip over them.  That having been said, DO NOT skip over every chapter you feel has no bearing on the plot.  On The Whiteness of the Whale is one of the most important parts of the book - it perhaps answers why we find clowns so creepy.  <br />The important thing to remember is that Moby Dick is both low art and high art.  It is a rollicking adventure tale, in which we find a lot of great prose and ruminations on the meaning of existence.  Beware of the phantom spout, don't look too long into the fire, and enjoy the book.	2002-04-10

This is the second book in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles.  To read this book, one must first read Interview with the Vampire.  However, once one has read Interview, one finds this book covering a lot of the same ground - at least thematically.  Rice packs her novels to the brim with a lot of preachy, pop-existentialism, which gets very boring after a while; \\"life is meaningless...\\" yadda, yadda, yadda.  It's a bit tiresome to hear this point expounded again and again - especially if one is not suffering from clinical depression and comes to realize that, difficult to accept as it may be, life isn't meaningless.  We have not, as Nietzche said, moved \\"beyond good and evil.\\"  Good still exists, morality still exists, and - recent events notwithstanding - God is still in His Heaven.<br />One of the main gimmicks that Rice uses in her tails that is original is to tell her stories from the Vampire's perspective.  This has advantages and disadvantages.  She has rightly picked up on the fact that the heroes of Vampire tales are the vampires and not the \\"good guys.\\"  However, part of the charm of Dracula (who is ridiculed in this book) is that he is unapologetically bad - he simply is what he is, and does not make excuses for it.  Therein, we have the central flaw of The Vampire Chronicles.  By making excuses for their actions and blatantly asking us to sympathize with them, we actually lose sympathy with the vampires.  They are living in \\"bad faith\\", to use Sartre's phrase.  They are living (is it un-living?) in denial.  How can one actually love Lestat when he is so head-over-heals in love with himself that there is no room for anyone else's affections.  Throughout the book, he is constantly uttering pretentious bits of teenage nonsense like, \\"I've always rebelled against everything,\\" and \\"I've always been good at everything.\\"  I kept waiting for him to say, \\"I'm a lonerDottie - a rebel!\\"  It is only fitting to find out that Lestat started out as an actor - he has all of the actor's flaws: selfishness, self-centeredness, narcissism, vanity, cruelty...  If Lestat was a real person today, he'd be one of those waiters with streaked hair who judges his acting ability by the number of visible abdominal muscles he has.<br />In the same vein, Rice is trying to pander to her audience.  Past generations were `bad' or `ignorant' we are told, which is why Lestat took so long to rise from his grave.  She is trying to kiss-up to young people by telling them they are so much wiser and more moral than their elders.  As a member of the generation whose butt she is trying to kiss, I find this assessment to be laughable, and these passages sound like an older person trying to act young - sort of like when your parents try to act cool.<br />Now, all that having been said, the novel picks up considerably towards the end.  We finally get some of the answers that we'd been told we never would.  In doing so, we are introduced to the best new character - Akasha, The Queen of The Damned.  Then we jump forward in time - covering the events in Interview from Lestat's perspective, and then on to modern day with Lestat as a \\"rock star\\" (although I doubt his concerts could really compare to Ozzy's).  Old friends are reunited and just when things really begin to get interesting - the book ends, leaving me thinking, \\"I can't believe I'm actually going to get suckered into another one!\\"	2002-04-08

The only point I can imagine to writing a review of Fellowship is for people who've seen the movie and are wondering if they should read the book, or for people who're wondering if they should read the book BEFORE going to see the film.  The answer to both questions is, OH MY GOSH, YES!  The movie is about as good an interpretation of the book as anyone could've hoped for - but even so, they still had to leave out a ton of stuff to make it into a manageable movie.  People who've never read the book will wonder who Tom Bombadil is.  What makes reading the books so essential is that no movie can capture the actual LANGUAGE of the novel.  Whereas the movie is about action set-pieces, the book is more about a quest - meeting new people and traveling imaginary lands.  Reading the book will only increase your appreciation of the film - and reading it first will only make it even better...having Gandalf, Frodo, and Rivendell in your mind and then seeing them brought to life is well worth the effort.	2002-03-04
US	52606675	R2UN3CTAL9YCR2	1563893304	523289763	Kingdom Come	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Great Graphic Novel	This story covers some of the key issues in graphic literature: What would the world be like if superheroes really existed?...and, What happens when superheroes get old?  The answer to the first question is that life would be pretty lousy for us humans if we had to compete with \\"metahumans\\".  The very concept of  \\"human accomplishment\\" has been abandoned and humans openly resent their superiors.  And when superheroes get old...the world changes, but they do not.  In Kingdom Come, the world has turned its back on the values upheld by Superman and the Justice League.  So, the old heroes have gone away - to be replaced by new metahumans who now fight amongst each other not for good or evil, but simply to fight.  The situation deteriorates to a point when the Old Heroes have to come back and force their values on a younger generation of super-beings who clearly don't want them.  In the end, the question is, Is this planet big enough for all of us?<br />Even though this book covers some familiar territory - especially if you are familiar with Frank Miller or Alan Moore - it's still a great read.  The best point for me is that Alex Ross has brought back one of my favorite DC characters - Captain Marvel - and he's bigger and badder than ever.  For all the fans of Marvels who wanted Alex Ross to take a crack at the DC Universe, this is it.  The art in this book is amazing and it is worth buying for that sake alone.	2002-02-22

Fortunately, for all us SHAZAM fans, Alex Ross has brought the character back in a big way - first in Kingdom Come, and now here.  The only drawback for Cap fans in Kingdom Come is that the Big Red Cheese is mostly a pawn of Lex Luthor throughout the book.  Here he has own story where he can be the hero.  These oversized volumes by Dini and Ross can be quite touching at times.  Here, the Captain visits kids at a hospital and befriends an abused child.<br />The art by Alex Ross is spectacular as usual - especially at the beginning where young Billy Batson visits the Rock of Eternity and the old wizard tells him, &quot;Speak my name!&quot;	2002-02-07

Well, the sad answer is that it doesn't.  In comparison to the three preceding volumes it comes as a bit of an anti-climax.  That having been said, I must acknowledge that The Golden Age should still be read by any Miracleman fan.  There are a few things that you should know about before getting into it.   First, the Big Blue Banana himself appears in the book hardly at all.  Having created Uptopia on Earth, there is little for him to do now except rule over it.  Occasionally pilgrims make the four-day climb up Olympus to \\"pray\\" - i.e., beg Miracleman for a favor.  That's all we really see of him.  The rest of the book is taken up with what life would be like in the new Miracleman universe.  Of course, we also get to see what \\"life\\" is like for the reincarnated souls in Olympus - especially all those Andy Wharhols.	2002-02-06

For anyone interested in a scholarly history of Superman, the two introductions are invaluable: giving us Superman's history, his revisions, and the people who made him.  The stories here are samplings from the entire history of Superman.  We see that, in the beginning, Superman couldn't fly (he could just jump really high) and that Lex Luthor had hair.  To me, the stories get much better in the later years.  There's a superman adventure by comic-legend Jack Kirby and, my favorite, a little story by Alan Moore about what to get Kal-El for his birthday.	2002-01-09

This story is actually more about the Joker than Batman, but so much the better for it.  It is more interested in WHO the Joker is and why he does what he does, rather than sensational fight scenes.  That having been said, the Joker does do some rather gruesome things in this book. We find a possible explanation of the Joker's past and his involvement with Batman.  This is great for anyone who's felt sympathy for the Joker and has rooted for him on occaision.  In this, we do see that Batman and the Joker really are opposite sides of the same coin.  They both exist because of the same thing: they each had &quot;a bad day.&quot;  Batman finally recognizes this, and tries to break them out of the &quot;duel to the death&quot; that they are both locked into.  For me, the best part of the book happens when the two main characters call a time-out, put all the B.S. aside, and really TALK to each other.<br />This is a very short novel, but having read it, it seems to have exerted as much influence over the movie Batman as The Dark Knight Returns.	2002-01-09

For those of you expecting a lame follow-up to the most important graphic novel of all time, this isn't it.  Dark Knight 2?...I try to explain this to my non-comic reading friends as if Homer came back and wrote another epic poem after the Iliad and the Odyssey.  Yet, I was expecting something OK, but that didn't quite live up to the original (i.e., The Phantom Menace).  Instead, what we get is something that promises to be even bigger and more expansive than the original.  Whereas the first book limited itself primarily to characters in the Batman comics history, this book goes further, with Batman reuniting with some old friends from the Justice League of America.  The whole DC Universe looks like it may play a part in this story.  In many ways, it reminds me of Kingdom Come.  Superman is there too, of course - getting the fuzzy end of the stick again.  The style of artwork is thankfully the same as in the original Dark Knight - without the modern, photo-shop embellishments.  This is part-one of a three part story; one can only hope the other two volumes can keep it up.	2002-01-04

There is a weird feeling you get, reading Alan Moore's Miracleman stories-the feeling that you're not reading a comic book.  The story takes place in the real world-not the comic book universe.  As the story opens, we find middle-aged Mike Moran being haunted by dreams of flying.  During a terrorist raid, he is taken hostage and suddenly remembers his magic word and becomes a super-hero again.  Having forgotten his past for twenty years, it all comes flooding back to him: which presents him with his biggest problem-how to explain things to the misses!  As he does, she (famously) begins to laugh at him!  The inconsistencies of his super-hero past begin to become apparent to him.  Of course something is wrong here.  Just what that something is, and how Alan Moore explains it are left for you to be seen.<br />Of course Miracleman (Marvelman in England) is the British version of Captain Marvel.  In reincarnating him, Alan Moore (as is his want) completely reinvents him for a new age.  Miracleman is `aufgehobened' for a new era.  For me, the best superhero comics like this, The Watchmen, and Marvels, try to portray their larger-than-life heroes as realistically as possible and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, put them in the real world, populated by real people, with real consequences for their actions.  In Mike Moran's universe, Superman is well-known...as a comic book character.  When Miracleman bursts onto the scene (literally) we imagine what it would be like if a super-hero really appeared in our world.  But then, the adventure begins...	2001-11-08

It is scary, but it resists characterization.  The oddest thing about this book is that it takes place within the DC universe.  Yes, the tone is VERY dark, and VERY bad things happen--but then there's Superman hanging around in the background...weird.  The story begins with a minor DC villain-The Floronic Man.  He brings Swamp Thing \\"back from the dead\\" and then begins doing things far worse than he ever did against the Justice League.   It is (literally) the DC universe in Hell.<br />As is Alan Moore's style, he takes over a character and completely re-defines him.  Like Miracleman, we find out that Swamp Thing isn't exactly what he thought he was.  The art is first-rate-much better than today's standards...subtler, more expertly drawn, with none of those annoying, PhotoShop embellishments.   It is a beautiful, fast, disturbing read from start to finish.  You'll never look at a swordfish the same way again...	2001-10-24

In reading a comic book about Jack the Ripper, I was expecting a completely made-up story with fictional characters loosely hung onto the Ripper legend.  Instead, what I found was a thoroughly researched, heavily annotated history of the Whitechappel murders.  The book is pure conjecture however-yet another theory on who the Ripper was and what his motivations were.  The conclusions drawn from this book aren't really original, but they aren't meant to be; Moore has added a large appendix where he footnotes almost every panel in the book.  I wasn't able to make it through all the footnotes myself, but it's nice to have them there.  <br />The book begins long before the killings take place and the identity of the killer is made plain long before he actually begins.  This is NOT a whodunit.  Anyone familiar with the Ripper story or any of the movies made about him will see which theory this fits into...but I won't spoil that for you here.  The catch of the book however is to show Victorian England as it really might have been: the realities of chamber pots and infrequent bathing.   This is not a Courier &amp; Ives print.  Whitechappel really does seem like hell on Earth: a place where almost all the women were prostitutes out of necessity, and where even police officers feared to go.  The art is perfect for the story; it is drawn in stark black and white to emphasize the bleakness of the atmosphere.  The lack of color almost makes it seem more creepy.<br />This is not the typical comic book...or even the typical Alan Moore book.  It may be an acquired taste.  If, however, you are looking to immerse yourself in the world and time of Jack the Ripper, this is the way to do it.	2001-10-18

The Watchmen is easily as good as Marvels, The Dark Knight Returns, or what have you.  This is a super-hero epic designed for adults who have a serious interest as comic books as an art form.  The term \\"graphic novel\\" is sometimes misapplied to over-blown comic books...that is not the case here.  Alan Moore is a great writer (arguably the best in the field) and, in The Watchmen, he has created a story of great depth, scope, and meaning.  I have discovered internet sites dedicated to pointing out the hidden subtexts and motifs of this book...they are not reading too much into it.  The task Moore sets for himself (as he often does) is to ask the question, \\"What would the world be like if super-heroes really existed?\\"  That question is more far-reaching than the average comic book implies.  The plot unfolds, not in a comic book way, but the way it might really happen.  The ending is completely original and totally unexpected.<br />On a personal note, this book will forever be entwined in my mind with the events of September 11, 2001.  Some of the issues in the book cut a little too close to home.  But for me specifically, I'll remember staying up late the night before reading this book, and then being awakened by my roommates early the next morning to the scene of the World Trade Center in flames...and thinking that I'd read the comic for too long.  Things this terrible don't happen in the real world, only in comic books...right?	2001-09-19

Kierkegaard is, by far, my favorite philosopher, and I tend to agree with most of what he has to say.  As a religious person, I agree with what he has to say.  The main proposition of this book is: Sin IS Anxiety, and the opposite of Anxiety (Sin) is Faith.  As an existentialist, we are all radically free (I know, Sartre's phrase) so when we despair (The Sickness Unto Death) we actually CHOOSE to feel that way.  Once we accept this, we can achieve serenity through Faith in God.	2001-09-01

It tells how the New X-Men get formed.  Also, the tone of comics darkened in this period, so we get X-Men fighting demons and the like.  We see the New X-Men's first encounter with Magneto.

The speed of light can be gotten around.  The aliens knew EXACTLY what we were like right from the start!  His vision of the ring around Earth is kind of cool, and the best thing about this book.<br />It needs to be said that Clarke's condescending comments about religion and religious people are so callow and insulting that I lost much of the respect I had for him.

I believe that this is the book that put Arthur on the map, and led him to the attention of Stanley Kubrick.  It has all the themes that are present throughout his work - and also all the problems.  The one concept that Arthur has never understood is that the status of the human race - or any race for that matter - is not as a species, but as a collection of individuals, each with his own story and agenda.  Therefore, the &quot;happy&quot; endings of his books completely miss the point philosophically.  Like most scientists, he would do well to read a little existential literature - but I fear that would mean nothing to him.  That aside, this is a major work in the field of science fiction literature.  Like all great science fiction it is about ideas.  Yeah, it does begin with a visual that was stolen for the movie Independence Day, but it is more about the concept that humanity is in its infantile state.  The only problem is, I find Arthur's conception of its &quot;adult&quot; stage to be truly horrific.<br />Also, Arthur has an unfortunate (and stereotypical) prejudice against religious-minded people which, alas, is present in this book as well.	2001-07-27

Even while maintaining that almost all of the important elements in the movie Psycho are found in the book, all the changes made for the movie are changes for the better.  The film was right to start with Marion (Mary) instead of Norman.  Anthony Perkins is more engaging that the fat, middle-aged Norman we are presented with in the book.  And none of the horrific stuff is the same without Hitchcock's masterful direction and Bernard Herman's unforgettable score.

There are two things that make this book great.  First, it has the best idea for a graphic novel ever: instead of thinking of simply another adventure for a popular character, go back through time to relive ALL of the best adventures of ALL our favorite characters, and depict them as if these things actually happened.  Second, and most important, it has the best comic artwork that I have ever seen - it is both beautiful and realistic.  Favorite image: The Human Torch fighting with The Sub-Mariner over New York City.	2001-07-27

A derelict alien spaceship enters the solar system and only one spacecraft is in close-enough range to investigate.  They get inside, but that is just the beginning of the mystery.  What I love about this book is the realistic way in which Clarke describes a solar system that has been heavily colonized by humans.  It is scientifically plausible and he doesn't try to fudge over little problems like gravity and the speed of light.<br />There is currently an all-CGI movie version of this in developement by David Fincher.  I look forward to seeing it, but one would do well to read the book first.	2001-07-27

Clarke is my favorite science fiction writer and I enjoyed spending more time in the 2001 universe but, in a very real way, there should never have been a sequel to 2001.  2001 ends with the next evolutionary leap for mankind.  This book - and all the others that follow - are merely an anti-climax and they belittle the importance of the first book.  I don't think that Clarke himself understood the importance of the first story.  All the successive books make you think, &quot;Well, what was the point.&quot;  All the Starchild can think of doing in this story is to start creation all over again on Europa.  Why?  What's the point?  What about Earth?  Clarke sidestepped all the important questions from the first novel for the rest of the series.  I mean really, who cares about character developement?  Also, an annoying trait that he has is that each novel disregards what happened in each of the previous novels: in the first book, Bowman goes to Saturn, in the second, we pretend that it was Jupiter so it can be more like the movie.  In the end, this book turns out to be a pleasant but forgettable read.  I do not view the events described as what &quot;really&quot; happened after 2001.  I think the Starchild could have come up with a few better ideas.	2001-07-27

This HUGE book is an excellent comprehensive survey of some of the landmark horror stories of the past couple hundred years.  Most of the important authors are here.  Poe, Lovecraft, Matheson, Jackson, Bloch, Ellison, King, Barker, etc.  It'll be tough to read the whole thing cover-to-cover, but it's very good to have.	2001-07-24

It's difficult to come to The Incredible Shrinking Man (or The Shrinking Man, as originally titled) as a blank slate.  Many fans of 1950's horror movies all ready know the story, and yet the book is still a must.  Matheson makes it more interesting by having two timelines running simultaneously--the hero at the beginning of his ordeal and the hero versus the Spider.<br />Also, a great plus about this book is that it features several of Matheson's short stories, including Nightmare at 20,000 Feet and Duel--both of which are more famous for their filmed TV versions.	2001-07-24

Jackson's smart and witty novel tells the story of a paranormal investigation through the eyes of Nell, who realizes that it may be better to belong in a haunted house than to belong nowhere at all.  It is also groundbreaking because of the implied lesbian relationship between the two female characters.  It also packs some genuine chills.	2001-07-24

With the possible exception of Moby Dick, this book tested my stamina as a reader more than any other.  Yes, it is a great adventure story but it is written in a convoluted prose style that was outdated in even Cooper's time.  I was inspired to read this book by watching the Michael Mann film.  If you go into this story expecting it to be sort of a novelization of the film, you'll probably be disappointed.	2001-07-23

Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	Essential	Lovecraft is undoubtedly the most important figure in horror literature of the twentieth century and this is a collection of his best work.  The first half of the anthology is composed of random short stories.  The rest of the book is devoted to stories involved in the Cthulu Mythos--especially The Shadow Over Innsmouth; one of the greatest short stories ever written.  These stories are essential reading for anyone seriously interested in horror fiction.	2001-07-23

Richard Matheson is the second most important horror-writer of the twentieth century, and this is my favorite novel by him.  On the surface, it bears many similarities to The Haunting of Hill House: four paranormal investigators, a lesbian relationship, etc.  This novel however is much grittier and the scare factor is greatly increased.  For me, the most interesting part of the book is the backstory about Victor Belasco and how Hell House earned its name...	2001-07-23

Many readers hated this book, Stephen King felt it was the best of the series, my opinion comes closer to King's.  This story is less sensational than Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs.  Those are great books each but they essentially tell the same story--unique FBI agent needs Hannibal Lecter's iside info to catch a serial killer on the loose before he kills again.  The purpose of this story is to let us into Hannibal's mind--literally.  Harris is able to make Lecter's flawless memory, super-developed sense of smell, and his love of cooking both fascinating and chilling.  The ending (changed for the movie) is much better in the book.  It offends many people but, after Lecter's escape at the end of Silence, this ending takes his success to the ultimate degree.	2001-07-23

That movie has been the best interpretation of this novel so far (even though it supposedly has nothing to do with it).  A close second would be &quot;The Homega Man&quot; episode of The Simpsons.  This is one of the many cornerstones of 20th Century horror which Matheson is responsible for.  The story is a character study of Robert Neville--the last human being in a world entirely populated by vampires--and all of the existential implications that entails.  Very well-written, creepy, and thought-provoking.	2001-07-20
