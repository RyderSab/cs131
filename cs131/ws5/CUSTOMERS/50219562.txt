Deep psychological insights, three-dimensional characters, a dark and fantastic story that will leave no one untouched. On top of being exciting, masterfully plotted and extremely moving, it is also very well written; some sentences and chapters are so brilliantly put into words that reading alone becomes a delight in itself.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's movie version is certainly a masterpiece in its own right, but - of course - it can't and doesn't come close to the depth of the original tragic tale crafted by Dennis Lehane.<br /><br />All in all: \\"Mystic River\\" is one of the best books I have ever read. Period.	2005-01-11

As many other reviewers, I have always enjoyed Ken Follett's novels over the past twenty years, even though his latest releases generally could not hold up to the literary level of such early classics as \\"Triple\\", \\"Eye of the Needle\\" and - of course - \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". <br /> <br />His latest work has all the ingredients of a typical Ken Follett novel, i.e. a strong heroine (Toni Gallo), some mild adolescent sex scenes and an interesting topic (threat of biological terror attacks), plus an interesting setting... but after almost four-hundred pages I felt awfully let down.  <br /> <br />\\"Whiteout\\" reads like a refused expos for a Made-For-TV movie, with ample commercial breaks, and there are a few glitches that are really annoying. Without giving away too much, but how come no editor (or Mr. Follett himself) noticed that all of the chase scenes around a small courtyard covered in two feet of snow should have left some treadmarks? Why is everybody \\"peeping\\" around corners and through windows, as if this were the only available word in the English language? <br /> <br />The whole story is completely predictable, and the twenty characters that people this novel are all pretty two-dimensional and predictable (dare I use the word cliche?). What could have been a fantastic theme (\\"The Needle\\" revisited in wintertime) suffers from more than poor execution. <br /> <br />I read this book in about two and a half days over Christmas, intentionally picking that time (the novel is set on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day), and I also got a few snowflakes outside to make the setting even more perfect, but - even though my hopes were high and my reader's spirit cheerfully optimistic - I could only casually recommend \\"Whiteout\\" as easy reading fare for extended bus rides or plane travels, if only it hadn't been written by one of the best thriller novelists alive today who has proven repeatedly that he can do much better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-30

Amongst that the troubled investigator plus his sidekick, wading through dread and horror.<br />Without wanting to give away too much, the shocking surprise ending is a clever twist, even though it does become foreseeable in the last fifty pages or so. Basically this is quite a brilliant book, except that I found the character development too shallow and one-dimensional. It could have been so much better had Mr. Lehane invested in one or two hundred more pages, to thicken the plot and give the novel more depth. Some of the side stories actually go nowhere or remain unexplained, at least that was my own shallow feeling after finishing the final pages - which was definitely not the case with &quot;Mystic Rivers&quot;.<br />Not bad, but with Dennis Lehane's proven writing skills it could've been even a lot better - that's why I'm only giving it three stars.	2003-06-11

He´s having a few bad days, just like the author, John Sandford, certainly cannot have been up to his usual standards when he started this novel.<br />&quot;Easy Prey&quot; reads as lifeless as the main character seems to appear. The storyline is hard to follow, and even though I plowed patiently through the 400 pages, always expecting things to finally take shape, this book is a huge disappointment, right up to the weak ending. Even without having been part of a series, this novel wouldn´t have worked.<br />The first five &quot;Prey&quot; novels are among the best thrillers I´ve ever read, the next couple fo Davenport instalments were OK, but &quot;Easy Prey&quot; falls terribly short of the mark. While Lucas Davenport used to be an ambigious, interesting character, his main role in this book is being half awake, mumbling &quot;Aw Jeez&quot; or &quot;Ah man&quot; all the time. I´m handing these words right back to the author, hoping for a new &quot;Prey&quot; that will rekindle the thrill.	2003-02-24
US	50219562	R1S0J7GNTUSWHO	0451186648	185361524	Silent Snow	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Dense and atmospheric	Minneapolis author Steve Thayer once again returns to the protagonists he used in his bestsellers \\"The Weatherman\\" and \\"Saint Mudd\\", this time including both the present as well as the past combined to create a unique and mostly exciting thriller.<br />Mixing fact and fiction about the Lindbergh kidnapping and a copycat baby-taking, \\"Silent Snow\\" starts out as a hugely entertaining novel. 1930´s character Grover Mudd and present-day hero Rick Beanblossom appear to have more in common than can be explained rationally, and the author brings this off quite well. The grim scenery, the wintry climate and the characters are described excellently throughout; Mr. Thayer is certainly an accomplished writer.<br />What I found very disturbing are the mild supernatural topics as well as a lot of threads that are never cleared up during these 400 pages. Also, of the dozen or so German phrases Mr. Thayer incorporates into his narrative, he didn´t get a single one right. You should imagine that a well-researched novel as \\"Silent Snow\\" ought to try to get these details right as well.<br />The violent ending of this book is way over the top, and spoiled a lot of this novel´s charm for me.	2002-12-17

Nelson DeMille´s witty prose, exciting stories and great craft make him one of my favorite authors. Re-introducing Paul Brenner of \\"The General´s Daughter\\" was another great idea by this gifted author.<br />Giving more than a few hints at his own experiences during the Vietnam War, Nelson DeMille gives us a thoroughly researched and highly interesting story of a hunt through the late 1990´s Vietnam. Intriguing and with many twists and turns throughout the story, \\"Up Country\\" makes for fascinating reading. The usual dry humor DeMille once again successfully uses to lighten up the dark atmosphere is a welcome bonus. Great book!	2002-09-30

It is astonishing to read all the other reviews and to find out how readers were divided by this book, hardly any mediocre opinions. I for one found it highly entertaining, well written and extremely exciting, and seems I am with the majority here. \\"Tell No One\\" is definitely one of the best thrillers I have read in a long time (and that´s been quite a lot of books).<br />There are a few clichées along the way, certainly, but all in all Dr. Beck´s crusade to find the truth about his wife´s murder eight years ago will not leave you cold. Both the romantic moments and the violent pages in this book (my first Harlan Coben novel, but certainly not my last) grabbed me deeply, and I found myself devouring this book in three sessions. The ending is a bit of a let-down, alright, but the excitement created by the author throughout the first 300 or so pages more than make up for that.	2002-04-17

Ned stumbles through the twists and turns of the book, barely reacting to all the massive blows aimed at him (which does make the character so sympathetic), and suddenly, in the bleakest of moments, he comes up with the grand scheme and brings down a whole network of big-money thugs? Hmmm...<br />Otherwise, &quot;The Job&quot; is a very exciting read, a novel that for once really deserves the phrase &quot;hard to put down&quot;.	2001-11-14

Nevertheless, another great thought-provoking and highly entertaining achievement from Mr. Harris.	2001-09-26
US	50219562	R1OCNBOFOYTPC8	0385333668	622480769	The Runner	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Exciting but flawed	As much as I love both the unusual setting (post-war Germany) and the thrilling tension throughout the book, the multitude of inexcusable mistakes spoiled the enjoyment of this novel somewhat, at least for for me. Even though as a native German speaker I usually couldn´t care less whenever international authors use the odd foreign language phrase incorrectly, Mr. Reich (who´s presumably spent a few years in Switzerland) does not get a single German phrase right in this book; sometimes it´s so bad that the remarks don´t even make sense. Sorry, but this gets really annoying once you´re past page 100 or so. On top of that, there are some pretty strange factual errors as well, mainly of geographical nature that could´ve been avoided by simply checking a cheap map.<br />Other than that, &quot;The Runner&quot; is a good thriller, comparable to &quot;The Needle&quot; by British author Ken Follett (who is a much better researcher, though). Next time Mr. Reich should hand his novel over to an editor who knows his business if he intends to venture out into a foreign setting again.	2001-09-05

I will now start reading the remaining five Harry Bosch novels in chronological order because &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; was that good. <br />Harry Bosch is a tough and extremely credible character, the book itself is an exciting read and very well written. I especially liked the fact that it kept you guessing right to the end, providing the reader (and Harry Bosch) with a lot of false tracks to explore. If you like John Sandford´s Minneapolis-based &quot;Prey&quot; series, you can´t go wrong with Michael Connelly.	2001-08-20

Having read all of Tom Clancy´s books in chronological order, I have always been inclined to ignore his blatantly extreme conservative views for the sake of getting an exciting story in return... these huge novels were always a nice read on the beach, at least.<br />In &quot;Bear &amp; Dragon&quot; though, Mr. Clancy´s right-wing outlook on life has gone completely over the top. His repetitive mentioning of those disgusting &quot;tree-huggers&quot;, &quot;chinks&quot; and &quot;rats&quot; really turned me off, as did his boring excessive macho talk and two-dimensional view of the female gender. Also, I couldn´t help to notice that Mr. Clancy all at once seems to be fascinated by having his main characters use the bathroom... no problem with that basically, but his fixation on nature´s call wore kind of thin by the time I reached page 300 or so. <br />On top of that, poor editing (John becomes Jack) and stereotyped characters spoil much of the reading fun that this book could have provided.	2001-08-20

There are of course a lot of similarities to Jonathan Kellerman´s L.A.-based Alex Delaware series, but Stephen White´s very credible Colorado characters lend all of his thrillers deeper roots somehow.<br />Like I said in an earlier review, opening up a new Stephen White novel is like visiting good friends. It´s great to see the main characters being carefully developed with each new novel - and with Stephen White you can bet that the story is always interesting, profoundly researched and well written.	2001-07-09

Irwin Shaw - in my opinion - was one of the best novelists of the 20th century, and it´s sad to see so many of his work out of print. It is therefore great news that at least &quot;The Young Lions&quot; is now available again in a new paperback edition.<br />A passionate book about the world at war, seen through the eyes of a group of desparate young soldiers. While Herman Wouk´s &quot;The Winds of War&quot; worked brilliantly on a grand scale, Irwin Shaw´s novel lets the war happen on a frighteningly real personal level. It´s tough, it´s emotional - an unrivaled novel that will leave no reader cold.	2001-06-21

Paul Wilson is a brilliant writer, and this unusual novel is the best example why. Originally written in 1984, &quot;The Tomb&quot; is not the least bit &quot;dated&quot; (except maybe for the charming absense of cellular phones which would´ve have been a great help for the characters involved). Once you get used to the really unusual mix of down-to-earth detective story and supernatural phenomena, this book is great entertainment. Repairman Jack is a likeable, very human character with a knack for revenge - a bit over the top generally, but very nitty gritty in other aspects. The storyline feels like a sometimes crude, but always exciting mix of the Big Screen´s Indiana Jones and TV´s Spenser character. <br />I have just bought all of the Repairman Jack novels in one order and will read the other three instalments in the coming weeks. &quot;The Tomb&quot; was a very promising start to a supposedly unforgettable series.	2001-04-30

This book about damage inflicted on a helpless child and layer after layer of secrets within an L.A. hospital will keep you guessing right up to the final pages and is absolutely flawless.	2001-04-17

I whole-heartedly agree with the first reviewer of this book - Irwin Shaw was one of the best (if not THE best) American storyteller(s) of the 20th century. Beautiful prose, great characters, lots of emotion - his books just seem to sparkle with life. <br />This wonderful collection of short stories - written between the 1930´s and the 1980´s - will leave you with even deeper admiration of his writing skills if all you´ve ever read of Mr. Shaw is &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; (which is an equally great novel).	2001-02-21

I´ve always been a huge fan of Mr. Follett´s work but was a little disappointed with the last two releases. After the first good reviews of his latest effort I eagerly awaited the delivery of the novel and immediately started reading.<br />The story is good and exciting, but the book could have been so much better if Ken Follett had just developed the characters a little deeper. The british edition clocks in at just 324 pages, at twice that amount &quot;Code to Zero&quot; could have been brilliant.<br />Just imagine the lead character waking up without any memory of who he is - solving not only his own mystery but working out his past love life, saving the American space program and bringing the bad guys to justice - all in 300 pages (net).<br />I would have loved a little more of this basically good story for my money. Ken Follett knows how to keep readers hooked beyond a few pages, as he´s proven with blockbusters like &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; or &quot;Night Over Water&quot; - why not try again?	2000-11-27

Like the other reviewers, I got hooked by that book immediately  and have neglected basically everything in the four days that it took me to  read these 600 pages.<br />I do not think that it should have been shorter as  Nelson DeMille´s detailed descriptions of what it was like behind the Iron  Curtain makes this book such a special treat. This is so much better than  all of Tom Clancy´s novels combined! Mr. DeMille not only writes in  excellent and witty prose but knows how to create breathless  tension.<br />There is a lot of John Corey (Plum Island, The Lion´s Game) in  this book´s broken hero Sam Hollis.
