The author is particularly good at linking the artist's themes and imagery to the personal, political, and social events that influenced them. Gloriously free of post-Modern jargon and wordplay, it's an enjoyable and challenging read from start to finish. The reader doesn't have to agree with Lisboa's multifaceted interpretation of every painting or pastel to appreciate her intelligence and breadth of knowledge. I would recommend it highly to anyone interested in Rego, contemporary art, or the psychology of artistic expression.	2003-10-15

Halkin takes the reader with him along jungle backroads and into out-of-the-way villages on his search for the tiny clues that might just pull away the curtain on two thousand years of history. It's an exciting journey.  The author's sense of humor and colorful writing keep things lively, and his scholarship adds unusual depth.  I read the last two hundred pages in one sitting.  <BR>   I won't give away the ending - and what Halkin finds - but I will say that the heroes of this story are those tenacious souls who memorized the traditional stories of their people and remembered them long enough for someone like Halkin to finally come along and listen.	2002-09-06

It contains the stories of Palestinians from all walks of life.  Some of them are tragic, others disturbing, and still others heartwarming.  The translations are very good. It also steers clear of all the usual clichs about Israelis and Palestinians.   <BR>   If you've ever wondered how Israeli policies over the last 50 years have opressed Palestinians and helped to create both their rage and despair, I recommend that you read this book.	2002-05-08
US	52425192	R3RPDGHYXWJLTY	0805070583	439605009	Spies: A Novel	Books	1	14	33	N	N	Pretentious and Amateurish	This is one of the worst novels I have read in a long time.  The writing, which attempts to be post-modern, is frequently pretentious and often simply incompetent.  The main character becomes more and more unrealistic and unsympathetic as the story progresses - especially since he never seems to remember the most important events that occurred during the period of time covered by the narrative. The ending - where the author desperately tries to tie all the loose ends together in the last ten pages - is laughable.  <BR>   Normally I would have tossed this book aside after the first thirty pages, which are dreadfully slow.  But I kept reading to see how bad it could get.  It exceeded all my expectations.  <BR>   I have the feeling that Mr. Frayn wrote a single draft of this book and then turned it in to his publisher as good enough.  It isn't.	2002-03-23

Unlike most contemporary philosophers, Singer writes clearly and expressively.  He completely avoids jargon and the ever-popular use of badly translated French expressions and concepts.  I would recommend it very highly to anyone interested in topics such as animal rights, abortion, and euthanasia.	2002-02-28

Some things don't work very well--for instance, the transcription of thoughts.  Nevertheless, it is well worth reading.  The lead character--Josef Kiss--is particularly intriguing.      I would recommend this novel highly to anyone interested in London and its history.	2001-01-18

In telling a moving story of courage and rebellion, Robertson succeeds in bringing the reader to Vesey's time and place. This book should be taught in schools, particularly as it brings to life an important and largley overlooked figure in American history.  I cannot recommend it highly enough to readers interested in American history, slavery, the South, and social justice.	2001-01-16

I only know that this book is so skillfully written that you believe every word.  Superbly drawn  characters.  Nothing flashy or gratuitous. I would highly recommend it to  anyone interested in the the difficulties of life and how we survive them.	1999-11-17

It is a novel that unfolds and spirals outward, giving us successive levels of understanding and meaning as we  read.   Rosenbaum's writing is impressive throughout, but especially so  when depicting the relationship between the protagonist and his mother.   Even subplots are skillfully handled--as with fugitive Nazi whom our main  character tracks down.        I would recommend this book highly to anyone  interested in serious fiction.	1999-10-18

His supposed insights are virtually all clichis.  Though maybe I'm crazy, since the professional reviewers all seem to believe it's the  best thing since the invention of the wheel.  Anyway, I gave the book two  stars because a large vocabulary should count for something in this world.	1999-03-11
US	52425192	R38TBT284Q3SGL	0374199655	493739548	The Metaphysical Touch: A Novel	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Wonderful Writing	Sylvia Brownrigg is an inventive and extremely talented writer.  She uses language beautifully, and her metaphors and images are consistently interesting and surprising.  I think that readers will probably find  themselves more drawn to one of the two narratives in this richly textured  book.  I loved reading the narrative about Pi, a woman who loses her way in  life after her apartment burns down in the Berkeley fire of a few years  back. For anyone from the Bay Area or Baltimore (two places that enter into  the story), I think that this book could be a particular treat.    I  would recommend the book highly to readers who value good writing and who  don't need fireworks or bombs or car chases in their novels.	1999-03-05

The author succeeds brilliantly at two very difficult things: 1) he manages to write believably from the point of view of a  disturbed teenager, making him both sympathic and--at times--difficult to  take; 2) he creates an honest portrait of motherly love, with all its hopes  and despairs. It's one of the best characterizations of a mother in modern  American fiction, in fact.    I highly recommend this book.	1998-12-23

In addition to all this, the book is  also quite witty.  Highly recommended.	1998-12-16

This book becomes ever more relevant as more  and more media fall into the hands of giant conglomerates--companies with  huge conflicts of interest.    I would also highly recommend another of  Chomsky's books, Necessary Ilussions, and a wonderful text by Ben  Bagdikian, The Media Monopoly.  Also, for a look at how the giant American  media distort coverage in a particular case, there's The Massacre at El  Mozote by Mark Danner.  I use these texts in my journalism classes and I  would recommend that other journalism professors take a look at them.	1998-12-04

In some ways, it's also more daring.  But I suppose it's unfair to compare, especially since both novels are well worth  reading.    I think that Sirius is one of the two best books ever  written about a dog (the other being My Dog Tulip).	1998-11-20

It also includes an intelligent and intriguing introduction to Pessoa written by the translator, Richard Zenith.	1998-06-10

This is an extremely honest, enjoyable and absorbing memoir.  It's for anyone interested in the author himself; psychological development; the search for self-realization; or gay rights. Some of the chapters are both moving and funny--not a small accomplishment.  The final chapter, about the author's heart attack and recovery, is particularly excellent. Forget the nasty reviews and read a memoir by someone searching for himself and fighting tirelessly for what he believes in.	1998-06-03
