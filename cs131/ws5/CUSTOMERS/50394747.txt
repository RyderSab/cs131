This is a really good case study about the survival (or demise) of a particular species. It should be of particular interest to hard-core parrot fanciers, as well as to anyone concerned about the captive animal trade or vanishing habitat.<br />The author covers a lot of ground, but I think the book could have gone into greater depth with some of the issues he brings up.  For one thing, he talks about rare birds that are in private collections, and how various government bodies are pretty much powerless to do anything about individuals who may or may not know what they're doing with their breeding projects. Sometimes groups that are desperately trying to save the bird (and more broadly, other fauna) end up working at cross-purposes. Still, I felt that this was underplayed. What SHOULD a private citizen do if he/she comes across a suspected illegal bird? When there are only a few viable breeding pairs left, each individual bird becomes so much more important to the survival strategy. On the other hand, what happens to such a bird if it's confiscated by an agency that then turns it over to someone who has no idea what they're doing?  An intelligent bird like a macaw could easily be permanently traumatized by that.<br />The fact is, our War on Drugs has leeched away any of the resources that might otherwise be spent on going after animal smugglers. But that's another story.<br />Mr. Juniper also includes some interesting parrot lore...another strand of the book I thought was a little light.<br />Because we're so familiar with \\"pet\\" birds, I don't think there is much awareness about the plight of wild parrots. In that sense, this book is definitely worth a read.	2004-02-17

The points he makes can be applied to any situation in which you find yourself endangered physically, mentally, or emotionally. He weaves together the tao te ching, chaos theory, musings on Roman military tactics, biological lessons on how the brain works to help us preserve the species by preserving ourselves, true-life experiences from people who have endured some of the more bizarre \\"accidents\\", and his own taste for thrills.<br /><br />Gonzales bookends the essays with the story of his father, a scientist who, as a young flier during WWII, was shot down over Germany. He survived when his plane was shot down and plummeted to earth, then lived through a harrowing recovery as a POW.<br /><br />Why did his dad make it when the rest of his crew was killed?<br /><br />Some of this has to do with events you can't control, and some of it has to do with how to control yourself so that you can find a way out of dire straits.  He points out that some people can make every correct decision and end up being killed, while others make every wrong decision and walk out of the woods (or off a mountain...) unscathed. But, you can learn to THINK like a survivor, and greatly increase your chances of getting through what may seem, even to others in the same sinking boat, like a no-win situation.<br /><br />Gonzales's dad taught him, \\"Plan the flight.  Fly the plan, but don't fall in love with the plan.\\"  Being prepared is only part of the equation; being able to adjust to changing circumstances is what a lot of us forget about.<br /><br />Reading this book is an adventure in itself. If you're a city dweller, like me, and don't anticipate not having the Sears Tower in your line of sight if you get disoriented, it's still enjoyable, and applicable to what you will eventually experience.<br /><br />This book should be on every high school reading list.  (Preferably BEFORE the kid takes driver's ed.)<br /><br />I also recommend Gavin DeBecker's books, such as THE GIFT OF FEAR. He discusses some of what Gonzales does, insofar as honing your inner resources so they work FOR you, but he is also very specific regarding cases of direct threats from other people. Gonzales does discuss how non-survivors can compromise a survivor, but most of what he talks about is environmental.<br /><br />If you are planning a wilderness trip or just a seemingly innocuous weekend hike, this book is a great reality check.  It's also an inspiration. Some of these stories are just amazing, and they prove how tough, and sometimes dumb, a species we are.s driver's ed.)<br /><br />I also recommend Gavin DeBecker's books, such as THE GIFT OF FEAR.

It's really funny. Mona is a shallow American girl who falls in love with a shallow Arabian boy, and they both have wildly unrealistic expectations for their relationship. Neither has any idea who they married, and when reality crashes into their world, it's a scream.<br />It's hilarious when newlywed Mona, in her bathing suit, walks past her husband and his friends--&quot;the flower of Islam&quot;-- who are loafing on the couch. They just DON'T GET each other.<br />As their marriage begins to unravel before it even starts, the young couple has to deal with disappointed (and angry) parents and a depressing Hollywood experience.<br />If you can find a copy of this book in your library, it's worth a look.	2004-02-12

Turkey is becoming a popular destination for Westerners (unless they're Greek and mad about Cyprus) and this book shows us why.<br />Turkey has been in the middle of things politically and culturally for so long, and yet the country and its people are pretty much a mystery to most Americans. Mention Turkey, and images from MIDNIGHT EXPRESS spring to mind. But every person I know who has visited has had great things to say: the people are hospitable, it's cheap, there's a lot to do and see, and the food is superb.<br />It's also important for us to understand our allies, and Turkey has been courageous enough to stand with the US even though it's been criticized for doing so. Turkey also shows us how Islam and secular society can co-exist. This is important now, as Muslims become a stronger political voice, in the US and in Europe.	2004-02-12

But it is a significant contribution to the debate on dangerous breeds and owner responsibility. It should be read by anyone who has an investment in those issues.<br />Diane Whipple was the victim of one of the most horrible deaths imaginable. This could have been prevented if the owners of Bane and Hera had been forced to take responsibility for their animals, although that's easier said than done. The dogs had acted aggressively toward other tenants, and were reported, but yet they remained in the building, intimidating or injuring anyone in their path. Why weren't the dogs removed from the owners? Because people were AFRAID to confront these individuals.<br />Unfortunately, most people would prefer to go out of their way to avoid the dogs rather than have them taken out of the environment completely. The problem with that is, you can't control where the owners choose to take them, and sooner or later--as with Diane Whipple--a deadly confrontation is set up.<br />Sadly, the demand for Presa Canarios has risen since the publicity surrounding this case. There are a lot of people who want a big, protective dog, and yet many of these individuals are not experienced with assertive breeds, or they don't know how to properly socialize an animal. ANY dog can be raised to be mean and vicious, and even a tiny Cairn terrier, when provoked, is capable of delivering a nasty bite. If that dog has been allowed to be dominant, and happens to weigh more than you do, a one-on-one fight is pretty hard to win. Especially when you're unarmed and cornered in an apartment hallway.<br />Does this mean that Presas (or pit bulls, or Rottweilers, etc.) should be banned?  No. As soon as a breed is banned, another faddish &quot;bully breed&quot; will take its place. In the meantime, great dogs who are well-trained by conscientious owners are punished. Some owners have had to give up their (innocent) pets simply because a subdivision or town &quot;outlaws&quot; that breed.<br />The Diane Whipple story in RED ZONE clearly shows how derelict owners create problems with mean dogs. If anything, the book should serve to encourage people, dog lovers or not, to demand responsible pet ownership. Your neighbor--or your child--may depend on that.e punished.

But she made it to safety and provided the cops with a good description.<br /><br />One year later and 100 miles from where that happened, another little girl was grabbed by a stranger, who said something to her--this was captured on videotape. The frightened child, instead of fleeing, cooperated. She was later murdered by her abductor.<br /><br />I think most of us fall into that second category, because we don't listen to the instinct to run, or to fight, or to (best of all) avoid those situations in the first place. We've been trained to suppress those very instincts that exist to preserve our lives.<br /><br />What deBecker's book so expertly does is re-train us to listen to our intuition, to scope out our environment and everyone in it, and to read the danger signs we would otherwise prefer to ignore.<br /><br />Panic and anxiety are not useful emotions; fear is different. Fear is what compels us to take action if there is a clear and present danger; it's what allows us to see what's happening and respond appropriately. It's an emotion that should be nurtured instead of conquered.  We don't want our kids to grow up afraid of the boogeyman, scared to go out of their homes or try new things or meet new people. De becker teaches us that, instead, if we develop and learn to trust our intuition, we can free ourselves from that trap, just as we can react positively if we are ever in a position that requires immediate escape.<br /><br />He shows, with examples and self-reflective exercises, what to ask yourself, and what to do, if you have a \\"gut feeling\\" that tells you something is wrong.<br /><br />Parents, children and women especially need this skill.<br /><br />It's great to learn self-defense, to build your confidence in what you can physically do to protect yourself. But that ability is enhanced by the lessons in this book.  And sometimes, being a black-belt is irrelevent to dangers that are out there.<br /><br />DeBecker's best lessons are learning how to listen to yourself, how to interpret warning signs from dangerous people, and teaching us how to predict behavior. You don't have to be \\"surprised\\" by someone's crazy or hostile actions if you can see them coming and cut them off at the pass. He points out that every time we get behind the wheel of a car, we're predicting what every other driver on the road will do. All we have to learn is how to apply that knowledge to a boyfriend who won't take no for an answer, a neighbor who takes a creepy interest in our kid, or a job applicant who is a little too persistent.<br /><br />DeBecker says some things that will rub people the wrong way--such as, for battered partners: the first time it happens, you're a victim and the second time, you're a volunteer. But that's actually true. If you KNOW what this person is going to do, and you choose to stay in the relationship in spite of this information, then you have to own the consequences.<br /><br />The appendices are useful and the reading list is also a good resource, but the IMPACT self-defense classes deBecker recommends are not available everywhere.

This book debunks that whole myth and presents us with the husky's smart, resourceful, strong, and heroic ancestors. They've proven their mettle again and again for their human partners, but never so brilliantly as when they raced to stop a diphtheria epidemic in its tracks.<br />This book is well-researched and well-written, and it's very interesting to learn about sled dogs in the context of Alaskan history. The authors also ably describe the horror of watching diphtheria victims--often children--literally have the life choked out of them while the doctor, nurse and parents can do nothing.<br />The Alaskan territory attracted people who were resilient survivors, in harsh conditions, and who had learned to respect the dogs they often entrusted with their lives. Sled dogs earned that trust by making split-second decisions on the trail that often made the difference between becoming hopelessly lost and finding the next outpost, or between freezing to death and getting home.<br />A sad part of the book is what happened after all the hoopla surrounding the Serum Run died down, and how the same dogs that risked everything--just because they were asked to--were later exploited.<br />Unfortunately, this is still going on.  A lot of people are drawn to the northern breeds because they look flashy, and then tire of the endless vacuuming, or the dog's innate urge to run, and the dogs get passed on to other owners or dumped.<br />This book reminds of of our debt not only to this particular breed, but to all dogs who give us so much and demand so little in return.	2004-02-11

When I was an undergrad--way back in the late '70's--we were told that no concrete evidence of cultures that practiced cannibalism existed. This was back when \\"primitive\\" societies were depicted as being pure and uncorrupted by modern woes, like MTV and carjackings.<br /><br />But, in fact, cannibalism has been a thriving tradition among some peoples, and has only recently been wiped out. (Maybe.) And among those who ate nervous system tissue (which would NOT be my first choice, had I been born a cannibal), kuru sometimes reared its ugly head.<br /><br />Kuru is yet another variation of the encephalopathy that turns the consumer's brain into sponge, which is eventually fatal. Rhodes, always a riveting storyteller, spins the tale of research into kuru, and its parallel prion-based diseases like Mad Cow and scrapie.  He also examines the cut-throat academic dispute that led some early researchers (Prusiner) to the Nobel Prize and led others, equally deserving, into oblivion.<br /><br />Now, Mad Cow is in the news again.  It seems we in the U.S. weren't safe, after all! Some of the meat processing industry has, for years, chosen to ignore warnings that selling \\"downer\\" cattle for human consumption is just YUCK. Also, there's evidence that there may  have been some tweaking the diets of many food animals--not just cattle--with brain tissue-based protein, so who knows where it will turn up. We may be reading about Mad Chicken disease in a few years.<br /><br />It seems that the public is either in complete denial that this is a problem, or else convinced that this is the plague of the 21st Century.  I don't think we'll know for another generation, when the effects will have started to appear.<br /><br />Not only that, but Chronic Wasting Disease, which affects deer and elk, has already infected at least two (that we know of) hunters who ate venison. As much as the media tries to play up the issue, and as much as the \\"authorities\\" try to play it down, we do have a problem that won't go away for awhile.<br /><br /> Rhodes offers a primer on the subject that is as fascinating as it is chilling.es offers a primer on the subject that is as fascinating as it is chilling.	2004-01-16

Of course, not ALL individuals who own exotic pets are nasty: some of them are conscientious and care enough to be well-informed about the species they choose to own.<br /><br />But the author of this book provides an important service to the public. Green sheds light into the dark corners of the exotics business, part of which involves shuffling zoo and research animals to canned hunt facilities or roadside petting zoos.  It all works through middlemen who assure legitimate keepers that their surplus animals are going to qualified handlers, when in fact they are often laundered through pet auctions or given to animal collectors who abandon them at the first sign of difficult behavior or ill health.<br />Take monkeys and apes. They're cute and smart, but mishandling can create a strong, deranged primate that will pose very real risks to anyone not familiar with their needs. Also, they harbor all kinds of diseases that are a direct threat to public health, and some that haven't jumped the species barrier yet but, in the future, may do so.  Hardly any sanctuaries exist that can care for them once they are no longer needed for research or public display. What should we, as a society that frowns on animal cruelty, do for them?<br />Anyone who is interested in exotics, animal-based research, or even visiting the zoo should read this book.  Yes, Green almost exclusively discusses the creepy side of the issue. But he also describes some very ethically-run sancutaries and some individuals in the zoo and research sectors who truly care for their charges' welfare.<br />As for owning exotic pets, I personally think there are some people who actually are qualified to do so. Who decides those qualifications? That's another issue. Also, &quot;exotics&quot; include everything from hedgehogs and sugar gliders to tigers and the great apes. I've owned the former two, and found them to be sweet little companion animals. (But if someone offered me a giraffe, I'm afraid I would have to decline.) Not all exotics are totally inappropriate for all people.  But some exotics are totally inappropriate for most people.<br />I do think that certain surplus zoo animals should be euthanized rather than forced to live out their remaining years in misery. I also think that the surplus itself should be examined: why aren't certain species more aggressively sterilized?  And, I think all zoo and research animals should be microchipped so that they can be tracked once they leave their original home.<br /><br />Green isn't afraid to name names and cite specific examples of cruelty. I know there are readers who are angry about what he wrote, and dispute his findings, but they haven't countered with any specifics that undermine this book.

In this well-written, engaging manual devoted to the American kestrel, Mullenix offers solid information for those of us who would like to house and fly kestrels. He covers everything, from equipment to manning technique, and his enthusiasm for this species is contagious.<br />  I think kestrels have been underrated, in part, because they're really CUTE.  (Well, so are hummingbirds, and territorial hummingbird males will stab each other in the neck.)<br />Mullenix opens the door on a great possibility for falconers who are urban or suburban hawkers, as well as for anyone who has always wanted to fly a &quot;real&quot; falcon but was a bit nervous about managing such a tiny bird.<br />  Thanks, Mr. Mullenix: you've added to falconry literature in a significant way, and I personally can't wait to apply the principles you describe in your book.	2003-12-31

This book is one-of-a-kind in that it is an in-depth, thoughtful and frank essay on everyone's favorite topic, and it doesn't veer into the pornographic or the clinical.<br />In the hands of a less-skilled writer, this book could have become silly or creepy. Rhodes, though, doesn't shy away from observations that put his most intimate experiences under a microscope. This is not a gossipy book; it's a sincere exploration of sensuality.<br />His first sexual encounter, masturbation, issues of sexual identity: it is all here. Rhodes doesn't exploit these subjects, and he doesn't offer them for the reader's approval. Instead, he describes his sexual history in the context of his life, which has had its ups and downs. It's a pretty brave book.<br />The most shocking part, to me, was not what he did sexually, but the fact that his daughter commented on it, which means she has read it!

I was looking for a good, basic overview of the religion of Mohammad, and I came across this highly subjective, often erroneous politically correct excuse for a book. If this is what Islam is all about, a billion people are in DEEP trouble!!<br /><br />The author, in many instances, confuses culture with religion. (His version of hijab is not \\"required.\\") His apologies for the Taliban, and the Rushdie affair, are sickening. And, his description of female genital mutilation is outright wrong. He paints a picture of \\"fantasy\\" Islam, where women were given the vote more than 1,000 years ago and where even the grass is Muslim!!! Riiight.<br /><br />But luckily, he enlightens us to the perils of being seduced by an anti-Islamic Western media that has fed us propoganda all these years and made up these deceptions to confuse us!!<br /><br />He also promotes a lot of misleading information, going so far as to re-write history to make it more acceptable to non-Muslims. Mohammad's marriage to a six year old child (well, he did wait until she was nine before he had sex with her--he was in his 50's)is dismissed as rumor. How is it that I have heard  and read this from many sources including Muslim accounts, yet the author changes Aisha's age at marriage to 16 without offering any primary source or authority? He never mentions that in some Muslim countries, Muslim leaders set the marriage age for girls at 9 BECAUSE Mohammad did this himself.<br /><br />Oh yeah, Muslims also discovered America.

And what if the family that bought the house--not knowing it was sold erroneously--was in a similarly desperate situation?<br />This is exactly the kind of book you want to take to the beach...the story moves along at a fast clip, the characters are multi-dimensional and interesting, and you just KNOW something horrible will eventually happen.<br />The two main characters--a retired Iranian air force colonel and a recovering addict/alcoholic--collide when they try to repair a mistake that is totally out of their hands. The colonel, whose luck took a nosedive after the shah was deposed, is doing menial labor in California while desperately trying to keep up the facade of wealth and ease. He stumbles onto a house auctioned for unpaid taxes, and he realizes he can buy it at a fraction of its worth and then sell it at a huge profit, setting him on the road to respectability.<br />The problem is, he buys a house that really isn't for sale.  The county made a mistake listing that address, so the auction comes as a big surprise to Kathy, the current owner/occupant, who has kicked drugs and booze and is trying to cope with losing her husband.<br />There is really no villain here, just a mindless bureaucracy that inadvertantly set everyone up. The colonel will lose his life's savings if he returns the house to Kathy, so he thinks the county should rectify their mistake. Kathy has no money and few options; she can't check into a luxury hotel for a long drawn-out court battle.<br />In the meantime, a cop sympathetic to her plight becomes involved with Kathy. The guy is a weinie, kind of a Dudley Do-Right who is so blinded by his infatuation with Kathy that he proceeds to make a series of mistakes that put all the characters in peril.<br />The author of this book is a carpenter, and the book is solidly constructed,like a well-built house. He gives the reader the full story, not just glimpses into the characters' motivations, but detailed insights that show us why they are the way they are. Dubus is a natural story-teller, I hope he writes something new, soon.characters' motivations, but detailed insights that show us why they are the way they are.

But what about the survivors of the war? How do they piece their lives together again after everything they've taken for granted has been destroyed?<br />Walt Whitman ministered to the wounded in a Washington hospital. In the short story &quot;Every Night for a Thousand Years,&quot; Chris Adrian describes Whitman's experiences: it is a heart-breaking and exquisitely crafted story, which appears as a chapter in this novel.<br />The novel allows Adrian to flesh out the characters, introduce new ones, and blend fictional with historical events. It's fascinating--and disturbing--to read about post-Civil War New York. Adrian brings the era to life, and he has an original perspective. There is a Gothic intensity to the whole book. And, he has the ability to allow the reader to feel sadness and loss. For those reasons, it's worth reading.<br />On the other hand, the story/chapter &quot;Every Night...&quot; was much better, alone, than as part of the book.  Also, there were so many characters, and some had more substance than others. I found the pace of the book a little jarring. Maybe that was Adrian's intent, to give the reader some sense of what it must have been like in the late 19th Century, letting go of the expectations you've built and having to construct new ones.<br />I hope Adrian continues to write. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good solid read, but I would definitely steer a depressed person in another direction.	2001-06-08

If you're thinking about getting a dog, this book is NECESSARY.  The literature out there that's breed-specific usually emphasizes only the good points of any particular dog.<br />Also, a lot of those books use &quot;code&quot;: &quot;Protective&quot; really means aggressive; &quot;active&quot; means &quot;hyper.&quot;  Unless you have a lot of experience with dogs, you might underestimate what you're getting yourself into. But this book lists assets and drawbacks objectively, so the potential owner can make an informed decision.<br />The authors have decades of experience with dogs, and their training approach is humane and effective. They know what they're talking about.  With my limited experience, a lot of what they say rings true. (I've had an Irish setter, a lab/terrier mix, and currently a golden retriever and a longhaired dachs.)<br />This book is also cross-referenced, so you can see if the family dog is also a good watchdog.<br />The only problem with this book is that it doesn't list every breed. That may make a future edition as big as the Chicago yellow pages, but I did find that to be a little limiting. Some of the super-popular breeds are suffering because of irresponsible overbreeding (goldens, for example) and I know a lot of people who are attracted to the less-popular types for that reason.  It would be good to have profiles of some of those dogs in here, too.<br />Best of all, this book is FUN--I found myself chuckling at descriptions of dogs my friends and I have had (&quot;If there is a God, there is surely a dachshund at His feet...&quot;). It should be on the shelf of anyone who owns, works with, or just gets a kick out of dogs.	2001-05-27

But then it sort of fizzled. I gave it two stars only because, like Saturday Night Live, it just didn't sustain the humor and energy that grabbed me in the beginning.<br />The funniest passage is his description of a nocturnal trip in his grandparents' motorhome.<br />There were a few other sections where I laughed out loud, but it always seemed that the reader was held at arm's length, so I couldn't feel Justin's adolesence anguish. I think this book would have been much better if it had been edited a little more tightly, or if the grandparents--and other peripheral characters--had more page-space.<br />Read this if you're going on a long bus trip.  It's not a great book, but it's not a bad book, either.	2001-05-27

In ANGELHEAD, he describes a tormented, mentally ill sibling, and he exposes the pain the illness brought on the whole family.<br />From the outside, the Bottoms family was middle-class suburban. When his older brother Michael began experiencing psychotic episodes, though, that world was turned upside-down.  A few neighbors and friends glimpsed what was going on, but the day-to-day tension of living with a man who could, in an instant, turn violently delusional must have been nerve-wracking for Greg and his parents.<br />At first, Michael's erratic behavior was attributed to recreational drugs or a lack of self-discipline. It wasn't until the Bottoms family was faced with the diagnosis of schizophrenia that Michael craziness finally made sense. Michael destroyed their home, and their lives; he drained their emotional resources, he even tried to kill them. They doggedly tried to stand by him and get help for him, but it wasn't enough.<br />Is every schizophrenic as scary or sad as Michael? No--Greg points out again and again that Michael's case was extreme, not all people with this problem are violent or unmanageable.<br />The real tragedy of this case is that Michael could only get the help he needed after he committed a serious crime, one that nearly claimed the lives of Greg's parents and brother Ron.<br />I know people who grew up in homes with a mentally-ill family member. Most &quot;outsiders&quot; would question whether this sort of thing can happen, if it isn't an exaggeration.  Well, it does indeed happen, and it leaves scars on everyone. Greg Bottoms had the courage to come forward and share what he went through. There are many, many families out there who need to read this book, to know they are not alone.	2001-05-27

Luckily, the last book I read--RANGE OF MOTION--was also the best of the three. I wanted to slap the main characters of the first two books because they a)made stupid decisions, and b)wallowed in their problems. But Lainie, in RANGE OF MOTION, is cut from a different cloth.  She has a positive attitude, she is not self-defeating or whiny, she does not allow herself to become embittered.<br />Her husband is in a coma after a chunk of ice falls on his head. He ends up in a nursing home, with no realistic hope for recovery. Lainie soldiers on, caring for her children, maintaining as much of a normal life as she can, while visiting her husband daily. She puts him through &quot;range of motion&quot; exercises, a probably futile effort to preserve muscle tone in the belief that one day he will wake from his coma and resume a normal life.<br />She's lucky to have a best friend who is truly there for her every step of the way (despite her own problems) and a mysterious &quot;houseguest&quot; who offers an odd sort of inspiration to keep hope alive.<br />This book is sad and funny and, also, uplifting. It isn't full of complex, dark undercurrents and disturbing implications about man's nature. There is no villain in this book, because it's Lainie's story, and Lainie has an unshakable faith in humanity.  She is a good soul, and the reader roots for her, and her family, all the way.	2001-03-21

It will a) reinforce negative sterotypes, b)blur the distinctions between religion and culture, and c)leave out information that non-Muslims find problematic, and in so doing promote the idea that Islam can't be questioned BECAUSE it has no concrete answers to offer.  It might as well be sub-titled: \\"There is no room for moderation or logic in Islam.\\"<br /><br />The constant use of \\"He\\" or \\"Him\\"--capitalized--when referring to the Prophet is very revealing. On the one hand, we hear that Muhammed was a human being and not to be worshipped like God, but I have been told by many Muslims privately that he is \\"Divine\\". This book obviously bows to those who deify the Prophet and accords Muhammed the same status as Allah. I guess it's time for that old politically-incorrect term, \\"Mohammedan\\", to come back into use when referring to people who worship Mohammad.<br /><br />The book is written in a warm and cuddly, user-friendly cartoon style, which makes it somehow creepy--like Communist propoganda or a Joe Camel ad.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good, unbiased history of Islam, and an introduction to Muslim beliefs, don't waste your money on this book. But if you're a Muslim searching for a clue as to why some people take a dim view of Islam, you might want to read this so you know what non-Muslims are being fed.	2001-02-24

Any parent's worst nightmare is the loss of a child; in this case, the child was murdered and the killers were never asked to take responsibility for the crime. The courageous mother who pursues justice is continually stonewalled and dismissed.  It is infuriating to read about what she went through.<br />Arkansas, where all this took place, was then under the leadership of a governor who has been shown to be as crooked as a country road--his involvement, and the involvement of his familial/political clique--is sickening.<br />I have yet to find anything that convincingly refutes the facts gathered by Leveritt. This is not a crackpot-conspiracy-theory book; it isn't a propogandist smear. I tend to think that, in the not-so-distant future, a LOT of interesting information regarding some of these high-ranking individuals will come to light. At this point, nothing will surprise me.	2001-02-23

This is the hippest hagiography I've seen so far, although the subtitle is a little misleading. For instance, the book doesn't even mention St. Joan de Chantal, who so fervently wanted to join the convent that she supposedly stepped over her children as they clung to her apron, pleading with her not to leave. (I know exactly how this woman felt.) Nor is St. Albans mentioned as patron saint of falconry; his life was allegedly spared as he was about to be burned at the stake, when a pure white gyrfalcon landed on his head. Some of the information is interesting--who knew St. Augustine is the patron saint of brewers?--and it really does flesh out the lives of saints we've heard about while growing up, like Saint Nick. And yes, there is a St. Wolfgang and (goll-eee!!) a St. Gomer. There are also appendices of name saints and patron saints, and scanning through the list leads me to believe that mad dogs and the Evil Eye were big concerns back in the Dark Ages.<br />I wish it were a  little more inclusive. But as one who has experienced personal intercessions by several saints--and is therefore intrigued by this subject--I found this book very enjoyable.	2001-02-23

That was good enough for me!<br />The teenage narrator, Josh, has a really engaging attitude. He has a close relationship with his dad--who, as the novel opens, leaves his Mobile, Alabama shipyard for a stint in the Navy during WWII. Josh and his &quot;Southern aristocrat&quot; mom are supposed to wait out the war at the family's summer home in New Mexico.<br />This has no adolescent angst or self-conscious soul-searching that marks so many coming-of-age novels. Josh makes good friends at school, has a lot of adventures and meets interesting characters. Josh is open-minded, honest with himself, and is not afraid to ask for help if he needs it. His story is compelling, and every few pages I laughed out loud.<br />This should definitely be on the required reading list of any high school. For the adult reader, it's the sort of book you can enjoy, pass around to friends, and look forward to reading again.	2001-02-18

Israeli novelist David Grossman spent time on the West Bank talking to Palestinians and Jews about how their lives have been affected by a constant state of hostility and frustration. He doesn't waste much ink on the complex political forces at work; instead, he gives the issues a human face.  He visits refugee camps, radical Zionist settlements, universities and kindergartens; he describes the humiliating searches at the Allenby Bridge (and how necessary they are); he interviews a Jewish lawyer who defends Palestinians caught in a Kafkaesque legal system. He finds people on both sides who want to listen to each other but never seem to connect, despite their best efforts. He asks the question, Can an occupying army also be moral, or does the act of occupation contradict morality?<br />This book offers no easy solutions to the problems in that part of the world. In fact, although the book was written more than a decade ago, the situation has only gotten worse. But these essays remind us that there is always more than one side to a story, and that not every story has a happy ending.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Arab/Israeli relations; Grossman fleshes out the raw statistics we hear on the nightly news. I hope he eventually writes a follow-up that is more optimistic.	2000-11-14

Wolff is very funny and very insightful, and he pulls you into the story right away. You get to know his friends, the &quot;Army types&quot;, the Vietnamese people, his (pathetic) dog, and his Stateside circle of intimates. These characters are all fully-drawn, especially his best Army buddy.<br />This is not a humor collection of amusing wartime anecdotes; war is ugly, and nobody gets out unhurt. Wolff includes all of this, but he has a sense of irony about events, and a sense of compassion toward people. Also, each chapter can stand alone as a fully-realized short essay.<br />I've read his short fiction and his memoirs, and I think Tobias Wolff is one of the most gifted American writers of this generation.	2000-10-11

Ballard wrote this semi-autobiographical novel, or fictionalized memoir (whatever genre it fits into)about his boyhood in China during the Second World War. He witnesses world-altering events as he is transformed from a rich little schoolboy into a street rat, surviving separation from his parents, near-starvation, illness, imprisonment and hideous emotional trauma. Jim overcomes all of this because he is smart and opportunistic, but he never loses his humanity, and he never becomes bitter.<br />This is also an interesting glimpse into the expatriate British (or Western) community in China during the war. It made me realize that there's a lot about WWII I don't know much about.<br />Ballard is a master story teller, no matter how much of this is factual and how much is part of his subjective memories.<br />I would highly recommend this book to any high school student studying 20th Century history. The Spielberg movie is good, too, but this book has so much more depth and texture.	2000-10-11

I was seduced by a TV show that featured the author demonstrating her technique, but when I got the book in hand, I realized it's all bark and no bite.<br />First of all, EVERY OTHER PAGE is an illustration. (Low-quality, I might add.) So, you aren't buying a book with a lot of information, because all that space is wasted on cartoons. Second, Ms. Butler doesn't bring anything new to the table. She reiterates the standard of dog training: be kind and consistent. I agree with that, but in order to work, the actual training CANNOT be done in one hour. (If you believe that, I have some diet pills that will help you lose about 50 pounds in one weekend.)<br />Maybe some people will find this book useful, but I don't think it covers anything thoroughly. There are a lot of other dog-training manuals out there that leave this title in the dust.	2000-10-11

The  story of his mom's life, it seems, is to get seriously involved with  abusive, possessive and controlling men, who foist their ugliness on young  Toby.  Toby's mother is not a weak pathetic person, but is actually a  vibrant, warm soul who is a poor judge of character. Toby's filial loyalty  and genuine concern for his mom make him a sort of enabler, as he tries to  be a sport and go along with each subsequent relationship.<br />All the  characters in the book are compelling, from Toby's absentee dad to his  self-absorbed, immature, poor-sport stepfather, Dwight, to the friends he  makes. Toby is a typical adolescent--he's good-hearted, but can be very  bad; he's smart, but can do stupid things, he's compassionate, but capable  of cruelty.<br />Wolff's writing will break your heart and then make you  laugh out loud. (His description of the Lawrence Welk show was more vivid  than a TV re-run could be.) You know that Toby and his mom will not only  survive their horrible domestic situation, but will eventually prevail.<br />The movie, which features L. DiCaprio as Toby and R. DeNiro as Dwight,  is a pretty good rendition of the book. But read the book first. There are  few memoirs in its class.	2000-09-06

YET,  after his plane blows up, you are almost in a state of shock to discover he  might not have been the man you thought he was!!<br />This is another Oprah  selection, and although I have enjoyed her book club recommendations in the  past, I am getting a little tired of some of these fly-weight choices.<br />This book was not boring--it moved quickly, and I really did want to  find out what happened.  It's too bad the guy blew up with his plane, which  was entirely too nice an end for him. But the wife definitely needed a  girlfriend who could sit her down and spell things out for her. I was  irritated that she was so doggedly loyal to the pilot, who came across as  sort of superior and full of himself.<br />Oh well, love is blind. I guess  this book serves as a cautionary tale to not put all your eggs in one  basket, especially if that basket isn't where he says he will be when you  need to reach him.	2000-09-06

The  mother of three young adult daughters, she lives in a big old farmhouse  with dogs and her devoted husband.  He is handsome, well-liked, smart and  nice--the local minister. Surprisingly (!), he is also a crashing bore.

Whoa! This is when things really heat up.  Eli's presence  dredges up all sorts of horrible memories of another friend's death. The  victim was REALLY obnoxious in a hippie-ish sort of way, although no one  was able to figure out why she was violently murdered. (Just like no one  can figure out why Jehovah's Witnesses were supposedly persecuted in the  Soviet Union. Hey, you knock on the wrong door once too often and you never  know where you might end up!)<br />  This book really has no surprises, even  though I kept hoping The Reverend would reveal an ugly streak and do  something wild.  It's a good beach book; you might enjoy the story,  even though I doubt you will care much about the characters.

This book has been criticized for not getting all the facts straight and not telling both sides of the story...or all sides of the story, because there appear to be more than two. Still, it is the most comprehensive  treatment, to date, of the scandal that was called Operation Falcon.<br />During the 1970's, the governments of Canada and the U.S. spent millions  of dollars setting up a sting operation that would bust wildlife smugglers  and blow the lid of the illegal international trade in valuable falcons.  Rare, and protected, North American birds were supposedly stolen from the  wild and shipped to wealthy Arabs. By the time this ended, many  law-abiding, licensed falconers had been investigated, their reputations  put on the line, and, in some cases, their (legal) breeding projects  imperiled. But the smuggling ring itself was never exposed, because, when  all was said and done, it never existed. Only a few sleazy characters were  involved, people with tenuous ties to the falconry community who  nonetheless cast (no pun intended) all falconers in a bad light.<br />This  book is a good, interesting read--whether it includes all the data or  not--and it is worth noting that a high-profile issue (like smuggling  falcons) can eat up a lot of tax dollars and can also affect people who are  not even involved in the alleged activity. The bad guys in this book are a  couple of sleazy characters: one, a falconer who is trying to cut a deal on  separate charges and offers to set up a sting, and the other, a greedy  yuppie-type who just wants to get rich quick, but can't quite get it  together.  But the real villain is the bureaucracy that grinds along and  chews up everything in its path. Some of the wildlife officers who had  always played fair (protecting natural resources and falconers alike) are  even harmed.<br />Operation Falcon's legacy to the sport is a residual  paranoia and suspicion of non-falconers. This concern is, all too often,  legitimate. It's too bad, because falconers have made significant  contributions to the welfare of our wild raptors, particularly in the huge  role falconers played in the peregrine's recovery.<br />Every falconer who  began practicing the sport after Operation Falcon has heard all the rumors,  but the answers remain elusive.

Unfortunately, it did not live up to all the hype surrounding its publication. I was ultimately disappointed that the funny parts weren't  funnier and the sad parts sadder. In a nutshell, the characters in the  book: Drink, drink, have a baby, drink,have another baby, bury a baby,  drink, go to church,have a baby, drink, bury a baby, drink, drink, go to  church, and drink. They are desperately poor and feel very sentimental  about Ireland, so they also sing songs while drinking, having babies,  burying babies, or attending church. I love Irish writers; they are natural  story-tellers, and McCourt is no exception. And I guess it says something  that at least a few of the babies survived to become successful adults. But  the constant theme of wallowing in sorrow was pretty depressing.	2000-06-15

This is not a manual;  it's an essay that helps to explain why  anyone would go through so much effort just to share in the privilege of  hunting in partnership with a wild animal. (No other modern sport allows  one to do this.)This is a book that can be read and enjoyed by anyone,  falconer or not, but the falconer will appreciate some of the insights  Bodio has--for instance, when he describes the infamous goshawk. I  recommend this to anyone who wants to learn what falconry is, or who is  seriously considering taking up hawks. It is fun, it is informative, and it  will stay with you for a long time.	2000-06-15

His patient, calm, straightforward explanations of the care and training of a hunting hawk is never condescending to the beginning falconer. In the US,  apprentice falconers must be under the guidance of an experienced,  sponsoring falconer. When your sponsor is not immediately available,  consulting this book is the next best thing. It is not the only falconry  manual in print, but since it is written from a US perspective, it is more  relevent to American falconry than some of the British books that are  available. If you are starting out in the sport, order this book.	2000-06-15

The book, told from the point of view of the midwife's adult daughter, who was  14 when the events took place, is about a midwife who performs an emergency  C-section on a woman she believes is dead. She saves the baby...but later,  doubts arise as to whether the patient was REALLY dead and a criminal trial  ensues.<br />You have to kind of overlook some of the  artsy-craftsy-kooky-spooky elements of the home birth movement, to which  the author seems really sympathetic. Not all midwives are such out-there  Earth Mothers as the one in this novel. Still, Sibyl and her family--and  her lawyer--are likaeable enough (so too is the family of the deceased).  You can have the best intentions and a fair amount of expertise, and one  mistake--or perceived mistake--can destroy the lives of so many people.  That's pretty scary, and that tension is what drives this book.<br />I might  mention that I would never have been considered for the jury in this case.  Seven years ago, my sister and her firstborn almost died because the  midwives attending her birth refused to call in the doctor despite extreme  fetal distress. But she wasn't at home during an ice storm. She was in a  state-of-the-art hospital in downtown Minneapolis. She probably would have  been in more compassionate hands if she had been in a taxi and had to rely  on the driver to catch the baby.	2000-06-13

Doyle comes from a long tradition of expert storytellers,and even if the reader doesn't  know much about Irish history, the tale is compelling.As a glimpse of Irish  political figures, the book made me want to read up on early 20th Century  Ireland.<br />Like all of Doyle's protagonists, Henry Smart is no victim.  He  has an inner strength and confidence that keeps the reader cheering--even  if he does engage in criminal activities like murder.<br />I can hardly wait  for the next two thirds of the series!	2000-06-13
US	50394747	ROLF4TGFN1PXY	1564161749	557043643	The Encyclopedia of Falconry	Books	4	24	26	N	Y	Add this to your library!	Falconry is a sport with a long, complex history and tradition, and there is a wealth of falconry-related literature out there. This book is good to have on hand when researching a word or phrase related to managing your own  hawks. Having all these definitions at your fingertips really helps (a lot  of falconry classics contain archaic language or very specific  terminology). But, the Encyclopedia also contains a lot of current  information. It is not a how-to book, so it does not replace any of the  better falconry manuals. It is, though, a solid reference tool you will  consult time and again.	2000-06-13
US	50394747	RIK3QMHZ8PF44	1885054017	254434221	The Falconer's Apprentice: A Guide to Training the Passage Red-Tailed Hawk	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Must-have for any new falconer	This was one of the first falconry books I read. It is simple and down-to-earth. At first glance it seemed a little TOO basic--no glossy photos, no complicated equipment patterns. It is simply a step-by-step  guide to training your first hawk. Oakes never condescends to the reader  while still breaking down the process--of training a wild-caught hawk--into  easy-to understand parts. He also never loses sight of the big picture. The  falconer is doing more than killing rabbits--he is a partner to his hawk.  This is both privilege and responsibility.	2000-01-21
