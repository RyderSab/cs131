He focuses on many bands, from Weezer to Sunny Day Real Estate to Taking Back Sunday, and devotes a bit more attention to Jimmy Eat World, but his real focus is on Chris Carrabba of Dashboard Confessional, who has transformed his real life pain into music that his teenage listeners sing, and empathize, and relate to their own confusing lives.<br /><br />The real stars of the book, though, are the kids and the communities they form.  While once upon a time, a high school loner would have locked himself in his room and listened to music with no contact with anyone else, now, as Greenwald notes, with a computer, he is never alone.  Perhaps the most powerful language comes at the end of Part I:  \\"Someone is singing about problems just like yours . . . You switch on your computer.  You're safe in your room.  You control everything.  You're alone.  But you check your buddy list and know, you are anything but alone.\\"<br /><br />Greenwald fittingly devotes a chapter each to the teenage Internet phenomena of Makeoutclub.com and LiveJournal.com, each communities where teens interact, writing entries to be read by \\"strangers\\" that they could never have spoken aloud to their \\"in real life\\" peers at their schools, and the online community members comment or reply, making the teens' ordinary lives seem special.<br /><br />The teens sing the song of their lives online as passionately, if less tunefully, as their musical heroes do on CDs.  And like the performers, each has an audience singing it right back at them.	2005-06-19
US	53021293	R19EUINN5KYE7O	0767903862	430278994	In a Sunburned Country	Books	5	6	10	N	N	Amusing book gets past the Aussie stereotype	Bill Bryson in this popular book (note:  in some countries, it is published under the name \\"Down Under\\") explores Australia, from the  resort beaches of Queensland to cosmopolitan Sydney to the treeless Nullarbor Plain to the distant city of Perth near the Indian Ocean coast.  While he looks seriously at Australia's problems, he makes it a delight.      On a recent trip to Oz, I made a point of having this book with me (it was commonly for sale at airport bookstands down there) and comparing what I saw with what he wrote.  Not only was it all accurate, but there seemed to be some response to his writings (the radio-based School of the Air for distance learning in Alice Springs, which Bryson noted had almost no Aboriginal students due to lack of \\"responsible\\" parents, made a point of telling tourists that Aboriginals generally lived in groups on the huge stations, and the Territory government would send them a nurse and teacher, leaving the School with no role)      But there's no doubt Bryson captured the spirit of Australia.  He captures the general politeness of the Australians--and also their occaisonal surliness, especially when a rule (however misguided) is involved.  He captures the beauty of the countryside, and also the beauty of the manmade habitations, such as the lovely city of Adelaide or the spectacular views of Sydney Harbor.      Bryson's view on Australian history is deadly accurate, from the First Fleet (those who disembarked from it seemed to survive in spite of themselves) to the slaughter of Aboriginals to Federation, which brought together a group of disparate colonies which had insisted on having their own individual train gauges!--to Harold Holt, the Prime Minister who went swimming one day near Melbourne and was never seen again.      While in Australia, I saw posters for Qantas for \\"the Spirit of Australia\\"--lines of white-uniformed kids.  This book has done a far better job of distilling that spirit.    Highly recommended.	2005-03-21

The early chapters (his experiences being forced to journey from Spain to Gibraltar by way of Tangier, his attempted invasion of Diego Garcia in the B.I.O.T, his journey to Tristan da Cunha) are clearly the best.  As for the Falklands chapter, it is interesting because he was on the islands at the time of the Argentine invasion, and I wish he had written some more about that.  He also treks to Bermuda, St. Helena, Ascension, the Caymans, the Turks and Caicos, and the B.V.I., and makes them live for us, as well as Hong Kong.      Why Hong Kong?  Wasn't that given back to China?  Yes, in 1997, but these journeys by Mr. Winchester took place in the early 1980's.  They are all rather interesting, but I would have hoped for an update in the new edition of this book (as well as a chapter on Pitcairn Island, which he had not been able to reach by the time Outposts was originally published, but subsequently reached).  Instead, what we get is a new introduction, which does tell us of his exile from Tristan da Cunha (he isn't permitted to land there due to islanders' resentment over what he wrote) and brief updates on some of the other islands (such as the St. Helena islanders' successful quest for full British citizenship).      Recommended, but with the 20-plus years, getting a bit dated.  Could use a good rewrite and updating.	2005-02-17

The money from sales go to buy local produce to ship to the home timeline. <br /> <br />But the novelty of the items cannot help attracting attention--from a Chinese-American repairman and his daughter (whom Paul soon falls for), from the German occupiers, and from Chinese tongs.  Paul, his father, and his new friend and her family soon find themselves in the middle . . .  <br /> <br />Good, interesting page turner.  Turtledove develops this idea better than he did in the first book, and captures your interest. <br /> <br />Still, there are annoying flaws.  If Paul and his dad can get forged papers and unlimited real and phony local currency from their home timeline, then why are they bothering to run such a risky operation at all?  Just buy the produce, or run a sham business that generates just enough money to avoid suspicion at all the produce they are buying.  And how much produce are they buying?  We see one episode in which Paul must convey dozens of crates down to the dimensional machine.  It is clear that he is not used to it, and he makes it clear (through discussion of his father's aches and pains, after all, he is in his forties!) that his dad doesn't do much of that either--and no one else can have access to the subbasement, where the machine comes.  There's no sense that enough is being sent home to justify the expense of keeping two employees here.  Not tomention the risk, since it is drummed into our heads that the Germans could easily develop Crosstime technology if given enough info, and put the home timeline at risk.  Is the truckload of garlic that is being sent home worth the risk?  Something smells here. <br /> <br />Turtledove is improving these young adult books (although political correctness is still omnipresent, presumably to make library buyers happy) but he needs to give these books as much care and attention as he does his adult books, to make them work. <br /> <br />Recommended, at least more than the first one.	2004-11-22

The Japanese take advantage of the surprise to land troops and, with the help of air superiority (since most US planes were knocked out on December 7), take control of the islands.  The US is not going to take this lying down, and gears up to fight back . . .  <br /> <br />  As usual, carefully researched, and with the expected variety of viewpoints, from Japanese commanders to US soldiers to civilians caught in the middle.  These characters are often very solid, though sometimes less so (the Japanese fisherman seems like something out of a Japanese version of \\"Flower Drum Song\\"!) <br /> <br />  Things progress through months of occupation and food shortages on the island, and conclude with a climactic sea battle, the equivalent of Midway (the first real carrier-to-carrier battle).  It's Turtledove's look at how the war would have progressed if the Japanese had had Hawaii as an advance base, rather than the US. <br /> <br />  Although this book is marked as a \\"novel\\" on the front cover, and two of Turtledove's stand-alone books are reviewed on the back cover, this is clearly part 1 of at least a three (most likely four) part series.  Several of the US characters (flyboy trainees, for example) never see combat.  At least three Japanese characters mull over the question of how they can defeat a country so wealthy that even their trivial leavings make things easier for the occupiers.  If one believes Turtledove's foreshadowings (and when he's so blatant, I'm inclined to believe him) the answer will be--they can't.  To say nothing of how he dwells on Japanese habits of suicide, execution, and disgrace for those who through little or no fault of their own, are defeated or captured, as well as Japanese military infighting.  While he nowhere actually says so (and therefore, I don't think I'm giving anything away) expecta Japanese implosion in future books. <br /> <br />  It's good, but it's a limited idea, and the primary purpose seems to be to refight World War II--again--with a little more brains on the Japanese side, but with a safe American victory at the end of the day.  If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  But I don't think I'm going to be.	2004-11-16

Unfortunately, the group of authors who set out to write a sequel just couldn't imitate it. <br /> <br />That isn't to say that there is nothing to be gained by reading this book.  Throwaway details from the original (Sedmon of the Six Lives turns out to be sextuplet clones a la Bova's The Multiple Man, details of Imperial and Karres society are fleshed out) are given life, there are amusing segments aboard a circus vessel where Shakespeare has survived (incongruously) almost unchanged from ancient Yarthe.  (if so much time has passed that the name Earth was altered, how did Shakespeare survive unchanged?) <br /> <br />  But try as they might, they could not recapture the magic of the original classic.  The characters from the original book seem almost caricatures of themselves.  And, as half the charm of the original was in the tongue in cheek style, the sequel starts out way behind the original and never comes close to catching up. <br /> <br />  Recommended.  But you might want to wait for the paperback.	2004-10-08

This is new material to most, as figure skating is one of those sports which to the average person only seems to surface every four years, but here we see the skaters progress from the provincial rinks where they started to the big time.<br />  I found somewhat disquieting (having attended the pairs final in Salt Lake) the tone of the book as it goes blow by blow through the night of the pairs final--making the claim that the crowd was unanimously on the Canadian side, and booed the marks (the second mark, which forms the title, and determined, initially, the gold medal, is for artistic merit) unmercifully.  I remember some boos, some puzzlement (how many of the heavily corporate crowd really understood figure skating?), and some cheers, enchanting as the crowd found the Canadian pair.  I suspect that Goodwin is indulging in a little history rewriting in a book which will be read primarily in North America, and little noted in Russia or China.  Goodwin uses such phrases as &quot;justice was done&quot; about what was, after all, a very close decision, 5-4 including the disputed, and ultimately disqualified, French vote.  <br />  A second difficulty with the book is that it really breaks little new ground on the scandal.  You learn little more than the reader motivated to buy this book could have learned from the many articles which appeared in the weeks and months following the Olympics.<br />  It is a good read for human understanding of the six skaters.  But it makes clear that there are more questions unanswered than answered, and it gets us little closer to the answers.	2004-07-11

This book makes it clear that this was the least of her attributes.<br />  Dr. Gilbreth spent over a half century as one of America's leading engineers.  First colloborating with her husband, Frank Gilbreth, she spent the first forty years of her widowhood on an intense schedule of conferences, consulting, and teaching, finally retiring near her ninetieth birthday.<br />  While the primary focus of this book is on Dr. Gilbreth and her engineering career, and the conculsion makes clear author Jane Lancaster's bitterness that Dr. Gilbreth is best remembered for the fictionalized mother of &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, fans of the book will find material to satisfy them.  Several chapters deal with the family's life.  Few of the many footnotes are simply to &quot;Cheaper&quot; or its sequel, &quot;Belles on their Toes&quot;--appropriate, as a later chapter deals with how &quot;Cheaper&quot; came to be, and that it was written not as non-fiction, but rather as things should have been.  For example, the episode in &quot;Cheaper&quot; where Dr. Gilbreth spent a day in bed, and the children were convinced that a new baby was due, having associated Mother's brief bedstays with childbirth, was based on Dr. Gilbreth giving birth to a stillborn, thirteenth child.<br />  Jane Lancaster gives life to this pioneering woman engineer, unfortunately typecast by her children's books.  Highly recommended.	2004-06-27

A Season of Brawling, Boozing, Bimbo-chasing, and Championship Baseball with Straw, Doc, Mookie, Nails, The Kid, and the Rest of the 1986 Mets, the Rowdiest Team Ever to Put on a New York Uniform--and Maybe the Best	Books	4	24	28	N	N	Insightful book about the rowdy 1986 Mets	Pearlman tells the tale of the '86 Mets, how they were put together by brilliant GM Frank Cashen, the turmoil and triumphs of the '86 season, and how this team with so much potential for dynasty status managed to win only one championship.<br />  Pearlman begins with a bang--the near destruction of the interior of an airplane by the newly crowned NL champion Mets, returning from Houston after the classic 16 inning battle which won them the NL crown.  <br />  Much of the focus in the early part of the book is on how GM Frank Cashen built the Mets piece by piece, taking them from the no-hopers of the early 80s to the great championship team of '86.<br />  The discussion of the regular season (since the Mets won by some 20 games, not that exciting) is livened up as we meet the individual members of the team.  <br />  We see the behind the scene tumult as well.  Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden display early signs of the flaws that would mar their careers.  Manager Davey Johnson seems blissfully unaware of the turmoil which will eventually shatter the Mets, making the Mets of the late 80s one of the greatest teams to win only one championship.<br />  Time slows as we reach September, with the Mets' mini-collapse that prevents them from clinching the division against the distant second-place Phillies, leading to a Tuesday night riot at Shea as Mets fans storm--and nearly destroy--the field after the Mets beat the Cubs for the division title.<br />  Time slows further for the postseason, where the Mets meet their most severe tests, and two opponents--the Astros and Red Sox--each convinced that they can beat the Mets--and each nearly does.  We get blow by blow coverage of the great Game 6 in the Astrodome, and the forever famous Game 6 against the Red Sox at Shea which ends with the famous Bill Buckner play.  Pearlman questions Bosox Manager McNamara's decision to leave Buckner in the game.  (shades of, though probably this book went to press before, the decision to leave Pedro Martinez in the game in Game 7 against the Yankees in 2003).<br />  We see the anticlimactic Game 7 (in which, though Pearlman doesn't catch this, the Mets get a lead at home for the first time in the postseason) and the celebrations--for which Doc Gooden does not appear.  The seeds of destruction of the team can be seen even as the city celebrates.<br />  Well written with passion.  Highly recommended.	2004-06-26

The &quot;noble rot&quot; of the title refers to the fungus which aids in winemaking, but it also refers to the collapse of the traditional, often aristocratic men who once dominated the trade.<br />  We are shown the traditional growers, the &quot;garagistes&quot; or new small growers who have revolutionized the trade, the merchants, the brokers, the consultants--and perhaps most important of all, the reviewers, led by the highly influential Robert Parker, whose reviews can make or break a wine.<br />  Among those who are discussed at length are Michel Gracia, stonemaker and garagiste, whose wine at its peak sold for over $100 a bottle, and the family Lur-Saluces, owners and producers of the famous Yquem, whose family infighting and arrogance leads to foreign takeover.  They are fascinating stories, spread out through the book inbetween looks at co-ops who produce vast quantities of less stellar wine, and explanations of the hidebound 1855 classification system that, pre-Parker, once dominated Bordeaux.<br />  A worthwhile read from someone who clearly knows his field and loves it.  Highly recommended.	2004-06-23

Not so.  de Coubertin, to use Sir Isaac Newton's phrase, stood on the shoulders of giants.<br />  Chief among those giants was William Penny Brookes, of Much Wenlock, Shropshire, England.  From this obscure town, Brookes, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, began an Olympic movement (the games he founded still exist).  David C. Young tracks Brookes, and the games (once national in scope) he founded, and Brookes' contacts with and inspiration of de Coubertin.<br />  Young also traces the Athens games, long forgotten, which predated 1896, and another giant, Evangelis Zappas, who gave money and energy to put on these games.<br />  Young also traces the struggle to put on the 1896 Athens games, and gives us a blow by blow account of those games themselves--at which de Coubertin was little thanked.  He also gives us a brief, but interesting explanation of why the 1906 Intercalary Olympic Games took place in Athens, and their contribution to the Olympic movement, which in many ways exceeded those of the other early Olympics.<br />  Young sheds light on the background of the modern Olympics, and on figures too long forgotten.<br />  Highly recommended.	2004-06-23

She gives us a coherent tale of the man, prior to the Bounty, during the voyage, and afterwards.  It is interesting to note the legend of the Bounty becoming established during Bligh's own lifetime, and Bligh's dismissive reaction to that.  Perhaps more could have been written concerning the second mutiny against Bligh, twenty years after the first, in Australia.  Alexander contents herself with a short defense of Bligh (whom she clearly admires, and in the text devotes herself to his defense)<br />  The lengthy description of the court martial of the captured Bounty crew members is another highlight of the book, which is worth reading just for that.<br />  Also interesting is the attention devoted to Peter Heyward, a poor relation of several naval families who is convicted in the court martial but is later pardoned and goes on to a successful naval career.  Alexander tries very hard to make a connection between Hayward's family connections and the pardon, but the sources are just not there for her.  Heyward, interestingly, was also seen as a key character by Nordhoff and Hall, writers of the book &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, who made the character based on Hayward (Roger Byam) the central character of that book.<br />  While the book tells how the Bounty legend began, a chapter continuing past the deaths of the last of the Bounty crew (which ends the book) and showing how the legend reached its present state, with the Nordhoff and Hall trilogy and the several movies, would have been helpful.  Greater discussion of the voyage of the mutineers on the Bounty and their lives on Pitcairn Island would also have been good--it receives scanty coverage as is (though Alexander paints a fascinating picture of the efforts to obtain information from Alexander Smith, last of the mutineers on Pitcairn).<br />Good reading.

Conroy sketches his characters with obvious delight (his portraits of Teddy Roosevelt and ex-rebel James Longstreet are memorable).  Since Conroy sometimes gives us background on a historical character, and sometimes does not, a knowledge of history wouldn't hurt in reading this novel.  Still, the plot does tend to drag in the middle, though it perks up a bit towards the end with the major battle scene (in of all places. Connecticut).<br />  In the model of Turtledove's \\"The Guns of the South\\", though not as good.  Still, it is well worth reading.<br />Recommended.	2004-04-12

Minor, who submitted tens of thousands of early literary usages of words.  Dr. Minor was an inmate at an institution for the criminally insane, having killed a man.<br /> Mr. Winchester is a master of the book about obscure, but important elements of history, having written a number in this genre.  It is a fascinating story, and it is to be regretted that there isn't more of it.  Although it is never explicitly stated, it would appear that records were hard to come by.  Thus, the book (I read it in trade paperback) is 242 pages (including 21 pages of postscripts), with fair size margins, good size print, and each of the eleven chapters starting with a OED definition which occupies anywhere from half a page to a page and a half of the text.  Then there are digressions-well, suffice it to say, that the kernel of the story is relatively small, when all is said and done.<br /> Undoubtedly, Winchester did the best he could with the material he could find.  But the reader hoping for much material about Dr. Minor and how he made this mammoth contribution to the dictionary will be disappointed, since that portion occupies a relatively small part of the text.<br /> Somewhat recommended, but you might want to glance at it in a bookstore rather than buying it blind.	2004-03-17

Hamilton has written his usual lengthy, well-thought-out book of a complex future society which comes into sudden crisis.  This is the first book of a two-part series.<br />In a prologue, Hamilton gives us a great telling of the first Mars landing-which becomes a dream revenge against NASA and its culture.  One might think the whole book was written to justify this scene.<br />But jump ahead a few centuries.  Mankind has spread to hundreds of planets, linked by trains which pass through wormholes connecting worlds.  With this technology, spaceships are not needed and almost unknown.  Prosperity is widespread if not universal, expansion continues at a gradual pace, and the few alien species found so far range from friendly to indifferent.  <br />When two distant stars are discovered to be each surrounded by a sphere, the discovery provokes only mild interest.  But when an obscure astronomer learns that the envelopment took place in less than a second, interest turns to alarm, and the first major space expedition in centuries is sent to learn more.  But space exploration proves to be a two-way street . . . <br />Much like the Night's Dawn trilogy, this book has many point-of-view characters, allowing us to follow multiple storylines in this complex book.  Hamilton shows his usual talent for getting mankind into a serious fix.  Still to be seen is if he can get the species out of it in a convincing manner (something he was not completely successful with in \\"The Naked God\\" and \\"Fallen Dragon.\\")  With artificial intelligence playing a major part in the latter portion of the book, we may be headed for a true deus ex machina solution.  And when one of our point of view characters, in search of alien knowledge, picks up a teenage hitchhiker along the way, every literary convention there is tells us that the kid has to play a major part in the outcome . . . <br />On a negative note:  Hamilton, a Brit, should really watch his tendency to have his characters speak British English and exhibit British culture, without any explanation (he did the same thing in Night's Dawn).  When an American-born character uses a term like \\"non-starter\\" (p. 188) and eats oatcakes (p. 189), it is rather jarring.<br />A good first part.  Let's see where he goes with the second one.	2004-03-16

Now he expands it into a short novel.<br />  The short story told the story of the meeting between Moiraine and Lan.  The expanded novel includes the incident, related in the WoT books, of Gitana's Foretelling of the birth of Rand, overheard by Moiraine and Siuan, and what happened because of that.<br />  Perhaps the most interesting part of this book is that we finally get to see what happens when an Accepted tests for the shawl, and the ceremony as one is raised to Aes Sedai.  <br />  Also valuable are the insights into the characters of Moiraine and Lan--who spend almost no time as point of view characters in the WoT books.  You start to feel you know what makes them tick.  Also important and interesting is the extensive amount of exposure we get to the young Siuan Sanche--Moiraine describes her as \\"born to lead\\", and so we know it will all transpire.<br />  I suppose you could read this as a stand alone book.

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	4	2	4	N	Y	Interesting insights on the Bush administration	This book shows us Paul O'Neill as \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\\"  He wants only what's good for all, and is gradually disillusioned by the ideology of the Bush administration.  <br />  O'Neill's journey as he comes to Washington and eventually leaves a sadder but a wiser man  is interesting, and some of the highlights have already been reported on the evening news.  The portrayal of the second President Bush as a man who wants proposals broken down to simplest terms, and seems to blow whichever way the last person to speak is blowing, is compelling.  Also interesting are the portraits of such enigmas (to us) as Greenspan, Rowe, and Cheney.  <br />  The material gives much aid and comfort to the administration's opponents.  The problem is, though, that some of the value of the points that are made is destroyed by the clear bias Suskind brings to the writing.  Suskind asserts as a fact (page 299) that the initial Bush tax cut gave a \\"disproportionate boost\\" to the wealthy.  Disproportionate?  Who decided that one?  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but Suskind, as a presumably neutral narrator, shouldn't be making that kind of statement.  <br />  It's good, and interesting, and valuable, but its bias destroys some of its value.  It could have been done better.	2004-02-17
US	53021293	R1BANSHYZRXFG7	074325998X	759058813	For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs	Books	3	7	7	N	Y	Interesting for Heinlein fans tracing the Master's work	When Perry Nelson's car careens over a cliff in 1939, he doesn't expect more than a few seconds of life.  Yet he comes to himself in a blizzard, and is helped to safety by a beautiful and talented woman.  He soon learns that the year is 2086, and he is in an America which has eliminated poverty, and where each citizen is free to act as he likes, so long as he does no harm to another.  He adapts readily to the society, but has difficulty overcoming his 1939 values . . . <br />  Written in 1939 and never published, this was Heinlein's first novel.  In the model of Edward Bellamy's &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, it was unpublished for a good reason--it really isn't that great, and bogs down readily in political and economic discussion.  Still, it is worth buying for the Heinlein fan.<br />  Why?  Not because of its readibility, but because one can trace so many concepts Heinlein would later develop so brilliantly.  The &quot;may I do you a service&quot; society of &quot;Methuselah's Children&quot;--the &quot;roads&quot; of &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot;--even the roots of the story of &quot;The Man Too Lazy to Fail&quot; from &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;--all may be found here.  Nehemiah Scudder is described.  You never know when you will meet the seed of something Heinlein would later use.  A character makes an economic statement--and you remember that Dr. Chan, in &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; said almost the same thing.<br />  You get a slice of the early Heinlein, as he morphed from naval officer (not coincidentally, Perry's 1939 job) to SF master. <br />  Recommended for the Heinlein fan, but not for someone seeking their first taste of the Master.	2004-01-23

This short collection includes the original &quot;Ender's Game&quot; short story, two previously published tales involving Ender or his family, and a new story, &quot;Teacher's Pest&quot; about how Ender's parents met.<br />  In the days before Card had the luxury, if a novel ran too long, to split it into two novels (as he's done), he showed, in the story &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, that he could write a fine, tightly-written short story that had imagination and that kept moving.  It was justly nominated for a Hugo, and probably should have won.<br />  The other three short stories are nicely written, and, as you might guess by the title, are about first meetings of characters in Ender's universe.  &quot;The Polish Boy&quot; shows the first interaction between Ender's father and Captain (later Colonel) Graff.  &quot;Teacher's Pest&quot;, as mentioned above, tells how Ender's parents met.  &quot;Investment Counselor&quot; is about the first meeting between Ender and Jane. (not counting Jane's origin as a computer program in Battle School).<br />  Each of the three other stories is a nice piece, containing plenty of incidental background on the characters.  It is unclear if Card intends to develop further books focusing on these characters, but he is giving himself ample room to do so.<br />  In the meantime, it's nice to have these short stories.  &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is too rarely republished.<br />  The illustrations make the people illustrated look like caricatures.  They were at best annoying, especially the ones of the battle sequences in &quot;Ender's Game&quot;.<br />  Recommended.	2003-12-09

Sent to Nueva Barcelona (New Orleans) by his wife Peggy, he more or less accidently becomes Moses to an Exodus of slaves and other downtrodden people.  With yellow fever and soldiers not far behind, and the seemingly impenetrable Mizzippi ahead, he must try to lead these people to freedom.  Meanwhile, his uncontrollable younger brother, Calvin, is stirring up trouble on an expedition to conquer Mexico . . . <br />  Good, but not great, continuation of the Alvin Maker series.  As you can tell by the title, Alvin finally begins his Crystal City (and not surprisingly, since much in this series parallels Latter Day Saints beliefs, it seems to be on the site of Nauvoo, Illinois.)<br />  While we meet Abraham Lincoln in this series (an Abe who apparently did not buy a barrel of law books at a cheap price to enable him to study law on his own), Lincoln's explanation as to why he doesn't have a last name reflecting his profession is weak.  Most of the people who don't have such last names are historical characters in our world (William Henry Harrison, for example).  It's not a new complaint, but--Card should have thought this through.  He's inventive enough.<br />  With Alvin seeming to parallel Joseph Smith, and with his people defying the U.S. to some extent, the groundwork seems to be laid for this universe's equivalent of the U.S. attack on Nauvoo and death of Joseph Smith, which eventually led to Brigham Young and his people's trek to Utah.  How this will play out in Card's works should be interesting.<br />  Finally, Card really, really, should update his political maps to show the developments he has mentioned through the series--the new states, the closing-off of the Trans-Mizzippi, etc.  The maps are the same as at the start of the series, though this book's version does show Springfield and Crystal City--the latter on the WEST bank of the Mizzippi.  It's more an annoyance than anything else.<br />  Recommended, if you've read the previous five.	2003-11-27

Yet there is not the depth as in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series.  He's not making any major point (other than, perhaps, that Victorian England could have used a good dose of feminism).  Perhaps Pullman had not yet realized that teens could be told a story with adult ideas and concepts.  Still, there are flashes of brilliance.<br />  Pullman's Victorian England is well-researched, but there is the occaisonal gaffe, as when he has a character in a cheap dockside pub drink a GLASS of gin--it would almost certainly have been made of pewter, due to breakage and the expense of proper glassware.<br />  I'm always a bit disappointed in historical novels when characters introduce concepts from later times.  Sally does so, both with feminism, and with introducing marketing concepts unheard of in Victorian times.  In a way, she acts like a character in a time travel novel, and it is a bit grating.<br />  Worth reading to trace the development of Pullman's writing.	2003-11-27
US	53021293	RHAK35T33VCUU	076530693X	193033614	Gunpowder Empire (Crosstime Traffic)	Books	3	7	9	N	Y	Interesting, uncomplex alternate history for teenagers	When Jeremy Solters and his sister Amanda are not going to Canoga Park High School (class of 2092 or so), they join their parents in trading in an alternate reality where the Roman Empire has endured into the late twenty-first century.  They can do this because their reality has developed technology which allows travel between alternate realities so cheaply that apples from \\"alternates\\" are for sale at the local Safeway.  Since traders in the Roman reality often travel as families, Jeremy's family stays together in a Roman city in present-day Romania as they peddle such items as pocket watches, straight razors, and mirrors--simple items, yet advanced beyond what the locals have--in exchange for grain to be transported home.<br />  But things don't go as smoothly as planned.  Jeremy's mom falls ill, and his father accompanies her home, leaving the kids on their own--and then, suddenly, entirely on their own as contact with their home universe breaks off.  If that is not bad enough, they face an invading army, and pressure from local authorities to reveal the source of their wares.  It will take bravery and thoughtfulness for Jeremy and Amanda to get themselves out of this one . . . <br />  An interesting concept which will apparently be used by Turtledove as the basis for exploration of more alternate worlds.  But this one is not up to his standards.  One never gets the sense that the kids are in any real danger, despite the bullets and cannonballs that fly near them now and then.  And these teens are almost too good to be true--they never act irresponsibly, and are a little too politically correct (freeing a slave, reacting with revulsion to fur, etc.).  The only non-PC element seems almost accidental (the only girls Jeremy gets the hots for are the daughters of other crosstime traders--he is manifestly uninterested in local girls).<br />  Seems very similar to childrens' adventure stories of a generation or so ago.  Pluck and determination will win in the end, without the need for complicated moral questions.<br />  Recommended for Turtledove's readers, to some extent, or for a first alternate history book for young teens.  Although frankly, as much as I enjoy Turtledove at his best, there are better books out there for both groups.	2003-11-24
US	53021293	R25GV5Z7Y88VD9	0451529022	553324409	In the Presence of Mine Enemies (Turtledove, Harry)	Books	3	17	19	N	Y	Interesting, but flawed, alternate history	In a world in which Nazi Germany won World War II, defeated America later on, and with its allies occupies the world, the few Jews remaining in Berlin have no option but to be more German than the Germans to avoid detection and state-sanctioned murder.  They eat pork, they are uncircumcised, and they can pass on only what is not written--paper being too risky in the event of an SS search.<br />  It's 2009.  The last of the WWII generation to become Fuhrer, Austrian-born Kurt Haldweim (guess who that is) has died, and a new, reform-minded Fuhrer has taken control.  The six Jews who are the point of view characters in this stand-alone novel look on with hope which has been extinguished almost as thoroughly as their co-religionists as they look towards a new day when they might, just might, be able to live open lives.  In the meantime, they must continue to face, and seemingly agree with, the unending anti-Jewish propaganda which lives on even though (as most Germans think) the Jews do not.<br />  An interesting novel.  Unfortunately, Turtledove quickly finds himself trapped behind the fact that characters in such a situation do NOT want exciting things happening to them, but to live quiet lives, and therefore the first two-thirds of the book are very slow-moving.  Perhaps the worst moments are the repeated bridge games (a hommage to Heinlein's \\"Farnham's Freehold\\"?) which go on for pages and pages, during which nothing much happens, and which are completely lost on the reader if you don't know much about bridge.  Much of the rest is very reminiscent of certain events in Russia in recent years, together with a Yeltsin-like character.<br />  Turtledove never ceases to amuse with interesting parallels from our own reality (a play is mentioned like \\"The Producers\\" but focusing on Churchill and Stalin, the Czech delegation at one point is led by \\"a playwright\\" (Havel), and, of course, the Haldweim-Waldheim parallel).<br />  In case you're interested, the title is taken from Psalm 23.<br />  But ultimately, Turtledove is too much trapped by his own conception to make much of this alternate history.<br />  Recommended to those who have already read Turtledove.  If you are new to alternate history, go read Turtledove's \\"The Guns of the South.\\"  It's much, much better.	2003-11-24

Her daemon has (as it did in \\"Amber Spyglass) settled on a form, she's at an Oxford school for girls, and Will seems more a source of inspiration than sadness.  The story begins (I won't give away very much) when a witch's daemon arrives and demands help finding a person unknown to Lyra . . . <br />  Well written, and well done within its boundaries.  The \\"artifacts\\" (a map, a postcard from Mary Malone (showing, incidently, Oxford sites some of which are significant in Pullman's works), a cruise brochure) are interesting, and contain some inside jokes, such as adverts for books written by characters we met or heard of in the trilogy.  The map is of course most useful in tracing Lyra's footsteps across Oxford in this short story.<br />  I am a little preturbed (and withhold a fifth star) about the fact that such a short story bears a rather high price.  At about fifteen cents a page, it is only worth it because of the quality of Pullman's works.  And if the other artifacts (there's an annotation on the cruise brochure which might be significant) play a part in \\"The Dust\\" (the forthcoming, longer book), I really, really hope that the artifacts are republished with that book.<br />  Recommended.  But you might want to think about sitting down in Barnes and Noble or Chapters and spending an hour reading this one, rather than buying it.	2003-11-19

Three of his best, Needle, Iceworld, and Close to Critical, are collected here.  Needle is the story of a virus-like alien intelligence who with the help of his human host, must track down another of his species.  Iceworld tells the tale of a science teacher from another world recruited to stop the flow of drugs from a mysterious source (as it turns out quite quickly in the tale, Earth).  Close to Critical is the story of two stranded children, one human, one alien, and the effort to retrieve them from a newly-contacted world with the help of the natives.<br />  Clement brings human and alien to life marvelously.  Combine that with his ability to make science understandable (an art often seen in, say, Heinlein juveniles, but seemingly lost today) and you come up with enchanting tales.<br />  Needle is probably the best of the three (and sparked an equally-good sequel, over twenty years later).  It is a true mystery, with all the clues to the solution available to the reader to solve before the characters do.  While the characterization is very Fifties (the human host, a teenage boy, is amazingly blase about having an alien in his body observing his every action), it is still a great tale.<br />  Highly recommended, as are the two remaining books in the series.  Kudos to NESFA for collecting the works of yet another great author into convenient hardcovers!	2003-11-19

This book is an improvement over the previous two inter-war books--perhaps because the material is more interesting, appalling as the Freedom Party's actions are, they make better reading than the Great Depression.<br />  Turtledove has the sense not to stick too close to the historical script.  While the 1936 Olympics in Richmond parallel the ones in Berlin, there is no Jesse Owens analogue (um, incidently, until after WWII, the IOC awarded BOTH Olympics in a given year to the same country routinely.  Where were the Winter Olympics held?  Miami?).  There is no Munich Pact as such, and most of the aggressive moves by the historical Germans are combined into an effort to regain the U.S.'s Great War territorial gains (and not even all of them).  There is no Kristallnacht, but no shortage of violence by the Freedom Party on blacks.<br />  Some of our frustration at what seem to be Turtledove's annoying, invulnerable characters is relieved as more than one bite the dust, including one of the most irritating.  Their roles as point-of-view characters are inherited by near relatives, alas.  <br />  Turtledove gets his characters set for conflict--two of the new characters will be our &quot;typical GI&quot; and &quot;typical sailor&quot; types.  We see that we will have a fighter pilot, an intelligence officer, and others giving us viewpoint in war--including a concentration camp head. <br />  The author's introduction of charactes from our own timeline as characters in this is often amusing (&quot;Dutch&quot; Reagan as commentator of a football game causes a character to think of him as a &quot;great communicator&quot;), sometimes obscure (Jerry Voorhis as US Ambassador to the CSA?  Will we meet Nixon in the next book?), andsometimes annoying (a philandering Joe Kennedy).  Since most of these were born 20-50+ years after the point at which Turtledove's timeline departs from our own, it could be wondered if Turtledove is not undermining his own logic.<br />  There are other quibbles (if the entire black sharecropper class is being thrown off the land by Featherston's tractors, that is far more people than the token homeless we see), but on balance an improvement on previous books.  One hopes Turtledove will let the story go its own way in the upcoming books, rather than a slavish retelling of World War II, but that already seems a false hope (with an aircraft carrier for the US getting radar, we seem to be headed rapidly towards a Battle of Midway).<br />  A good effort, and hoping for even better.	2003-09-03
US	53021293	R1P6APNNLVBGBC	0451459083	543198748	Conquistador	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Interesting alternate history novel with a few twists	When John Rolfe VI (descendant of the Virginia colonist and Pocahantas) returns from World War II, he is wounded and dissatisfied with life.  But when an accident creates a gateway to another California on a North America white men have never settled, he is quick to take advantage of the situation to lead his army buddies to settle the brave new world, and later, dissatisfied types from Russia to Rhodesia.<br />Set in 2009, the book switches back and forth from the present, as Rolfe's world of New Virginia faces discovery by a wildlife warden (who almost inevitably is shanghaied through the gateway) as well as incipient revolt by some New Virginians to the past, giving us episodes in New Virginian history.  As we explore a world which seems a conservative's paradise--quiet towns with patriotic citizens doing National Service, kids in school uniforms, etc.--the best that we can conclude that Rolfe is probably better than those who seek to overthrow him.  This despite disease-generated genocide caused (often unintentionally) by the New Virginians among the native people, and the threat of ecological disaster caused by their introduction of exotic plants.  Stirling lays these before our eyes and lets us draw our own conclusions.<br />  Contains several jokes for the Science Fiction fan--for example, the Afrikaners we meet late in the book share their names with Afrikaner characters from Turtledove's \\"The Guns of the South\\" and the sign outside Ralph's restaurant is a play on the sign outside Hugh Farnham's establishment at the end of Heinlein's \\"Farnham's Freehold\\".<br />  The appendix is very useful, not only for laying out the basis of the alternate history, but also in telling us one fact about Rolfe's original world that the careful and knowledgeable reader might figure out--but might not.  It is not necessary to the plot, but interesting to know--but I won't disclose it here, though there is a clue to it in this review.  But you get the clue very early in the book, so I'm not giving away anything.<br />Recommended.	2003-08-06

Still casting about for a way to develop his magical talents, he becomes swept up in the efforts of our other point of view character, Roddy, a teenage girl on the world of Blest (an alternate England where the King progresses around the kingdom most of the year) to defeat a magical conspiracy led by some nasty characters.<br />  Filled with delightful moments...and captivating characters, from Nick himself to the enigmatic, powerful character of Romanov, a very strong mage whom Nick encounters while floundering from world to world, to an escaped elephant named Mini.  <br />  As is usual in Jones's work, it is not all sweetness and light.  Not all of the \\"good\\" characters are entirely good, and learning that will be part of the growing-up process for our teenage heroes.  There are dark moments, deaths, family conflicts, mistakes by our characters, all of which is part of life and which Jones never spares us.<br />  The ending did seem sort of hurried, not as though Jones had run out of ideas (I can't imagine that) but as though she were forced to keep the book within reasonable bounds.  And, to a certain extent, the ending is telegraphed within the book.  Usually, Jones is a bit more clever about that.<br />  As usual, Jones borrows liberally from legend and story, and makes it all her own.  While not quite as good as \\"Deep Secret\\", still a fine, fine addition to her works--and leaving enough unresolved (I could have heard more about Nick's panther and what it indicates about him) to hope for more episodes in Nick's story, and that of Roddy and her world as well.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-04-22

A close advisor to Pete Rozelle, he was certainly on the inside as the NFL transformed from a league less important than college football to today's juggernaut.<br />  This book is strongest in the years 1966-70, the first few Super Bowls, the time of the merger.  Weiss gives us almost blow by blow action during this time.  After that (and the book is very loosely structured to disguise this) there is some info about the Seventies Super Bowls, and almost none (except for &quot;My favorite years&quot;, and some topical references to 9/11) after that, when Weiss was no longer responsible for the running of the Super Bowl.  So while the book is billed as a history of the Super Bowl, it is more a history of the first four or five than anything else, with a few later anecdotes.  There are plenty of anecdotes, if that is what you're looking for.  Oh, and you'll find that Super Bowl III is given the full treatment you'd expect.<br />  Weiss is an NFL insider, and clearly an NFL loyalist as well.  The late Pete Rozelle comes across larger than life in this book.  While he was a great man and a great commissioner, he doesn't seem human, as recorded by Weiss.  Other NFL loyalists (Tex Schramm, for example), get similar treatment, while those less loyal to Rozelle (Al Davis, for example), get the tear down treatment.  The Raiders' Super Bowl wins when the league was in the midst of litigation aren't mentioned (and the lawsuits only by allusion).  Maybe this would have made Davis look too good?  Yet those moments in the locker room, with Rozelle forced to pass the Lombardi Trophy to his litigation opponent, were fascinating for the fan (who doesn't have Weiss's access) to watch.  They aren't mentioned.  <br />  It's a decent book, and an enjoyable read.  But for one looking for a history of this NFL era, read a selection of books, from the rabblerousing &quot;The League&quot; to more loyalist treatments like this, to get a full perspective.  There really isn't an unbiased treatment I'd recommend.	2003-04-10

Her village fears the heartless wizard, Howl, whose dark castle insists on circling the village--but it is a wicked witch who suddenly places an aging spell on Sophie, causing her to leave the village and, exhausted, take refuge in Howl's castle.<br />  Filled with finely drawn characters, this is a book accessible for all ages.  Perhaps the best part is when the characters visit our world, and we see things through their perspective.<br />  Jones includes bits and pieces of standard fantasy, from fire demons to seven-league boots, but what results is, as always, entirely her own.<br />  Highly recommended.  Jones is finally starting to get her due as an author, and this is a good place to start reading her works.	2003-04-09

As is typical of Fodor's, it covers the major cities and a fair number of the less visited areas, cities, and islands.  Provided is a representative selection of hotels and restaurants, and a fair number of attractions.  It has many more maps than Lonely Planet, a definite plus.<br />  Major problems:  it is less useful for the traveller seeing Australia by road, since many country towns where motels are found are not covered (travelling from Adelaide to Sydney by a leisurely route, I looked for Port Augusta, Lithgow and Forbes in vain).

Mat continues his slow-motion flight from the Seanchan and his love/hate relationship with Tuon (we're given a couple of teases about Seanchan and Prophet habits of hand-chopping, but it goes nowhere), Perrin continues his utterly irrelevant chase after Faile and the Shaido, Rand his indecisive random walk around Randland, Elayne her schemes to regain her mother's throne (look for an amusing scene when a handful of noble teenagers are brought to support her cause), and Egwene, at long last, starts her siege of Tar Valon.  In the final chapter, this actually goes somewhere, and we are left with a cliffhanger.<br />  Another great source of frustration is that by the tenth book of a series, you expect the plot to start contracting towards the climax, in this case, it appears, Tarmon Gaidon.  This book does not do so, and it even expands the scope of the series, as pages are given to point of view characters who we saw little or nothing of in earlier volumes.  However many books we thought Jordan would need to wrap things up, add one more on.<br />  &quot;The Path of Dragons&quot; occupied only nine days of time.  This book occupies a bit more, but its start is sometime before the end of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot;, with the result that the characters react to the apparent cleansing of saidin about halfway through the book.  Frustratingly, it is not made clear if Rand was successful in his effort.  I think we deserve at least that much.<br />  The level  of detail we are given is ridiculous.  I do not think that we need to know the ins and outs of Andoran politics to the extent we are told.  The level of detail of the scenes (say, Luca's circus or the camp around Tar Valon), is again, too much.  It is almost as if Jordan was trying to fill the book with fluff.<br />  There are the usual Egwenian dreams and some Foretellings and the like for us to interpret, which will keep the discussion groups busy.  But with this creeping pace, how many volumes will it take to Tarmon Gaidon?  Ten more?  <br />  The book is not worthy of the anticipation and patience we expended waiting for it.	2003-02-11

While this book is heavily promoted as an analyis of contemporary America in light of the Sopranos, it is awfully light on the Sopranos side.  Basically, a snippet  of plot description from &quot;The Sopranos&quot; is used as a lead-in to each chapter, which then heads into dry sociological analysis.  <br />  Why is it I have the suspicion that this book originally lacked any mention of the Sopranos, but then received the snippets, the title, and the heavy promotion to get some portion of the Soprano fan market?  I guess it worked, I bought it without taking too much of a look at it.<br />  It isn't even very good sociology.  It makes all sorts of claims and statements without citing statistics or having footnotes.  <br />  Not really worth it.  Browse it in the bookstore and decide for yourself, but there really isn't much here.	2003-01-07

The topics conclude with \\"The Verdict\\"--Bishop's opinion of the episode as a whole.<br /> While the book promises insight and to tell us about things we might not have seen, it doesn't fully deliver. I doubt if any of the \\"insights\\" would come as news to anyone of normal intelligence who has paid attention while watching the series.<br /> Bishop, a Brit, tends to use Britspeak at odd moments--he refers to the young Tony hiding in the \\"boot\\" of his father's car, for example, rather than the American \\"trunk\\". Much more annoying are the errors he makes--he misspells \\"Paterson\\" as \\"Patterson\\", gives the first name of the imprisoned mob boss (never seen) as Ercoli--it is actually Dominic, or Dom (Ercoli is Tony's late, mentally disabled uncle), and misspells \\"caporegime\\" as \\"copa-regime\\", among many others.<br />A somewhat-useful reference guide, since it includes cast lists (but you can get those from the HBO web site as well). But don't expect too much beyond it. The cheapest of the many Sopranos books out this season, and perhaps also the least worthy. <br />Try another Sopranos book before you go here.	2002-12-20

Her younger sister must relearn to trust others, the only boy to kiss her must deal with the suspicion despite his ironclad alibi, her father suspects the right person for the wrong reason, and his efforts to mete out justice on his own will have unimagined consequences.<br />Yet Suzie is hovering over them all, in a teenager's heaven--with a high school like the one she never got to attend, but where she never has to go inside except for art class. The heaven contains ice cream parlors and packs of cute dogs, and other people share it to the extent they share her vision. There's even a guidance counselor to help her along.<br />Suzie soon learns that she can look down on the living, and we see their story through their eyes. Once the initial heavenly stage is set, the story is almost entirely that of the people on earth. But as time on earth goes by, Suzie learns that she can touch the lives of those dear to her--and perhaps even more . . . <br />The major flaw of this book is that almost no attempt is made to explore the ramifications of the afterlife concept the author hands us, and, really, that's the most interesting part of the book. The story is that of the people left on earth, and it isn't THAT interesting a story. <br />It's worth a read, but maybe not worth the investment in a hardcover. Library or paperback?

Marcus is 12, solitary, teased, worried about his suicidal single mom, and \\"doesn't get\\" a lot of things. When Will comes up with a scheme to meet emotionally needy single moms by pretending to be a single father--he figures they will have affairs with him, then realize he is not right for their kids and dump him, so no commitments--the result is that he meets Marcus, who soon figures out that Will has no kid. What starts as blackmail on Marcus's part quickly evolves into a relationship somewhere between friend and uncle, a relationship opposed by Marcus's mother, who fears the obvious. The relationship is frayed, until Will decides to resurrect the \\"single parent\\" scheme, with Marcus in the role of the kid . . . <br />A delightful and suddenly humorous journey to maturity for both Will and Marcus. Far better than the movie, and avoids the movie's soppy resolution. Written in the third person, Hornby still captures Marcus's literal-minded soul, and Will's reactions as he is dragged from his cocoon into caring for people almost against his will.<br />Well done, and well worth a read.	2002-11-04

He earns the odd bit of cash by selling the location of Hogwash to the Stun newspaper and other such schemes.  But the Stun scheme has backfired--Muddles are gathering in increasing numbers outside the gates, and Headmaster Alpo Bumblemore sees only one way out of being overwhelmed--Barry and his pals must stop the next Barry Trotter movie--or else!<br />  I would describe this book as mixed--the first chapters, at Hogwash, are inspired, so is the ultimate confrontation with Lord Valumart.  Inbetween, unfortunately, the book has a tendency to bog down<br />  Still, I'd say it is a good read for the Harry Potter fan or enemy.  Both should enjoy it.	2002-09-15

With her family, most of the soldiers perished.  Mara must gather her few resources and rebuild, while fighting a quiet war with her enemies.  In her favor--her willingness to ignore custom and tap into unexpected resources.  But will that be enough?<br />  Fine book from the other side of the Rift in Feist's Riftwar saga (Magician, etc.)  While there is incidental contact with some of the characters from Magician and its sequels(we will briefly meet Pug in this series, but he will not play any major part), this series stands well on its own, and is probably more accessible than the Riftwar series, which got rather arcane in its final books.<br />  An interesting and fine read.	2002-09-05

Seen through the eyes of various people who saw him (including, notably, Harry Flashman's father) (Flashman himself gets a brief mention) and who are telling their experiences to an unknown person, presumably an author or writer.<br /> Since Tom's fate is revealed in the prologue, watching Tom's arc, which will bring him achingly close to the top only to fall, is painful. But what makes this book is watching the attitude of those arond him, and the Napoleonic-era society which is delighted to embrace him as a novelty--and to turn against him the instant he becomes a threat or a failure. For all the wine, women and song he is given, the turning point in this book is when the misunderstood Tom realizes he will never be accepted, as a non-white, non-English contender, society and the mob will turn against him the instant he is seen as likely to become the champion.<br /> Fraser, as he showed for the later 19th century in the Flashman books, and as he did for the Edwardian era in Mr. American, shows an intimate knowledge and understanding of Regency England, which is brought to life for our enjoyment.	2002-09-03

Seems his late mother was once married to the recently deceased Lord Stratton's handsome but violent second son, Keith, and when she divorced him after an episode of marital rape, the shares were given to her by Lord Stratton.  With the old lord dead, the family is feuding over the racecourse, and Lee is asked to intervene.  But the aging but still choleric Keith is not the only foe he will have to face . . .<br />  An ambitious book.  With eight Strattons, six Morris kids, and a host of other characters, Francis is generally successful in creating individual characters (though some of the younger Strattons tend to blend as hostile faces in your mind)<br />  A few quibbles.  To a certain extent, Francis stuck to his formula in this book.  In almost all of Francis later books, Francis's hero (always a pleasant fellow in his thirties whom people just love to talk to) gets beat up about halfway through the book, and, in the climactic scene, would do credit to the hero of an action movie.<br />  Quite good, but not as good as his early books.	2002-08-29

He is soon brought in as a consultant by the police in what seems a relatively harmless, small scale fraud--someone is mislabeling wine. But it seems there's quite a bit more to it than that, and the wrongdoers are willing to kill--again--to avoid prison!<br /> With only a minimal involvement of the racing world in this mystery, Francis paints an interesting and informed picture of the wine and liquor industry. A bit formulaic, not unusual for Francis (his heroes ALWAYS feel they have to go get the crucial evidence themselves, rather than leaving it for the police!), but not unduly so.<br /> Well worth a good read.	2002-08-29

Imagine her shock one morning when she wakes up in her mother's body.<br />  Through an endless day, she must keep house (with uncooperative appliances), do the shopping for two ungrateful kids, ride herd on younger brother Ben, and do all this without ruining her family, her apartment, and without attracting too much attention--especially when she has to attend the sort of parent-teacher conference that she would much rather not hear what is said about her.  But at the end of the day, she has a new appreciation for herself, her mother, her brother--and even that annoying kid upstairs!<br />  An absolute delight.

But there's a lot of detours to go through before he gets there . . . <br />  An absolute delight, filled with puns and plays on words.  Varying ages will get more or fewer of the jokes.

Whacko Rangers, elves who are just a little too friendly, psychotic Stewards, and oversized Green Giants are just a few of the dangers they will have to face . . . <br />  With the satire now a third of a century old, post-Baby Boomers may have to think about (or look up on the Internet) some of the jokes.

As this book does not contain reproducible research, I cannot recommend it to any serious individual wanting a reputable source concerning the gun control debate. <br />  To try to get the answer he wants (that widespread gun ownership in 19th century America was a myth, not the truth), Bellesiles cites a number of sources.  Unfortunately, some of the records (San Francisco probate records) could not have been consulted by Bellesiles as they were destroyed in the earthquake and fire of 1906.  Other sources, when checked by other scholars, proved not to say what Bellesiles claimed.<br />  When confronted with this, and asked to show his research notes, he claimed that his notebooks were pulped by a sprinkler accident in his office.

One with a tragic physical flaw that is likely to kill him, the other with a tragic moral flaw, ditto.<br />The problem is that the writing, especially in this book, doesn't rise to the level that Card seeks.<br />Unless you enjoy endless conversations about minor issues, or five-page musings by minor characters, you are likely to find this book very slow moving indeed.  This book resoves the Eastern crisis that Card set up in the last book.  But it does it in almost a storybook fashion.  After a drop by drop setup (Chinese water torture, maybe?), we are told of tremendous military manoevers that I really don't find convincing.  Sure, maybe the Muslims can do all the things that Card has them do.  But the denouement relies on all the things being UNDETECTED, it is never explained how that is possible.  What happened to radar, satellite imagery, intelligence (in more ways than one)?<br />The whole military plot relies on the Chinese being slightly stupider than a comic book villian and little weapons advancement beyond 1949.  Very strange.<br />  The Bean/Achilles conflict reaches its resolution in this book as well, I will not say how.  But by the time we finally get to it, it is difficult to care.  In my opinion, this is due to Card's failure to make us feel anything except irritation when it comes to Achilles, however much we may like Bean.  Shadow of the Hegemon gave Card the opportunity to make Achilles interesting, rather than just an almost hypnotically alluring (to the other characters) villian.  It didn't work.<br />We get to see more of Peter Wiggin in this book.  But he comes across more as a sullen teenager, who (no fewer than twice!) has to be forcibly woken up by his parents than the titular ruler of the world.  If you're hoping to see how Peter transforms himself and his job into what we see at the end of Ender's Game, well, don't hold your breath, but if this is what you care about, hold on to your bucks until the next book.

Black's has long been mandatory to purchase at most major law schools.  But after the first year, it is little used, and few lawyers are seen to use it.  It is the sort of book you'll see gathering dust in a lawyer's bookshelves.<br />  The difficulty is that Black's, to be useful everywhere (if it can be) gives common-law definitions.  Lawyers are usually interested in how words have been defined and construed by the courts of the state they practice in.  A definition from Black's really doesn't have that much weight, a judge wants a precedent, not a nineteenth century definition.<br />  With the Internet containing many reference manuals, the utility of Black's is even less.  However, it is useful for the person (law student, paralegal, lay person who must read legal documents) who is a little over their head in legal matters and needs a reference.  Just so that you understand your legislature may have defined a word differently than what's in Black's . . . <br />  Make sure you're going to use it before you buy it, the various editions are awfully expensive just to gather dust.	2002-08-17

And just why did they want the money wired to the Cayman Islands? And where are they? It falls to sister Elizabeth to sort things out.<br />Quick moving, an easy read. Even though as a lawyer myself (Virginia, too), stories about a lawyer's troubles are not entertainment for me, it was still an enjoyable read. ... <br /> Somewhat of an annoyance for me were a number of errors McCrumb made about Virginia law--for example, the prosecutor would be referred to as the Commonwealth's Attorney. More an annoyance than anything else but it displays a lack of research detail.<BR>Well worth reading.	2002-08-09
US	53021293	R2HSKLNH95KYUG	0345418166	942080070	The Integral Trees	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Highly original concept, expertly executed	Centuries ago, the totalitarian State, governing Earth, sent out ships to terraform and put Earth life on other worlds. One of them, Discipline, controlled by the self-aware computer, Kendy, finds a habitable area which is not a world, but rather a habitable gas ring around a neutron star, the gas constantly being renewed by a planet spewing forth gas. In the habitable torus, life has evolved, notably trees shaped like an integral sign (an elongated S) Due to tidal effects, there is even gravity in the tufts on its end. The crew, convinced they have found paradise, explore the ring and do not return to Discipline. Kendy, unable to retrieve his crew, is out there waiting. And waiting . . . <br /> The story focuses on a group of descendants of the crew, living in the tuft of such a tree. Forced to abandon their dying tree portion, they are cast forth into the void, braving the Smoke Ring's wildlife until they fall into a jungle of vegetation. And then, they are captured by a civilization which still maintains some of Discipline's technology . . . <br /> Like many of Niven's books, this is set in a place most unlikely to occur, but which (who knows?) just might be out there. And the science is very carefully worked out. The characters (I particularly liked Jeffer, the Scientist) are well drawn, far better than the cookiecutter characters you often see in hard science fiction.<br /> A delight to read and a compelling page turner.	2002-08-05

The book contains fascination interaction between men and God, which Sasson brings out well.<br />  Not only does Sasson go phrase by phrase through the four-chapter book of Jonah, discussing the book, discussing sources, but he provides us with an excellent translation, and lengthy introduction and postscripts.  You'll read about the millenia-old debate as to whether Jonah is historical or not.  <br />  Sources from Jewish, Christian, secular, and other traditions are used.  <br />  Anyone from beginner to expert will get something out of this book, and it really doesn't matter what religion you are.  I have no idea what religion Sasson is a member of.  Jews may have a slight advantage in the discussions of Masoretic cantillation, since many learn them in preparation for Bar Mitzvah, but it really isn't necessary for a good understanding of what Sasson is getting at.<br />  A good source for the reference library, or for anyone interested in learning more about the Book of Jonah than the 51 verses in the Bible.	2002-08-04

To survive, Struan's always skates the financial edge, and Quillan Gornt, descendant of Dirk's enemy, Tyler Brock, is quite happy to push it over the edge.  <br />  Even though we meet many fine characters, from American businesswoman Casey Tcholok to smuggler's son Paul Choy, Hong Kong itself is really the star of this novel.  Seeming almost anarchic at times, the colony (as it then was, the novel is set in 1963) and its people, Chinese and British, seem to worship one god, Money.  <br />  Clavell ties in references to his other novels--characters from King Rat show up and relive their wartime hatred, many of the characters discuss and live out the heritage of Tai-Pan, and a Japanese character mentions briefly the events of Shogun.  <br />  This is the sort of book that will keep you up reading until 4 a.m.<br />  What I didn't like:  I found the character of Peter Marlowe most annoying.  He shows up all the time, acts like a know it all, and is really Clavell's way of writing himself into the book.  Also, about six different times, it is mentioned that the U.S. is starting to get involved in Vietnam, and each time, a precient character chirps (or at least thinks) that the U.S. will regret it.  Hindsight is 20/20, the novel was published in 1981.  <br />  A good read.	2002-08-04

If it has been issued since 1901, you'll probably find it in here (though a few issues get overlooked and later included, but that is not a major flaw).<br />The problem is that, with the endless stream of non circulating coins being issued by governments (and in some cases, &quot;governments&quot; needs quotation marks.  As does coins.), Krause is being forced to fit more and more into a volume which has already reached its limits on size, thickness, smallness of print, and thinness of paper.  Something's got to give.  Unfortunately, what has given is that the valuable reference material (such as original prices for coin sets) has vanished from its pages.<br />Maybe it is time to put the junk, like Marshall Islands and similar ilk, into a second volume which, like the pre-1900 issues volumes, gets updated only every two years or so.  Or put on a CD-ROM.<br />Fact remains, though, this is an indispensible reference book for the coin collector and dealer.  And mostways, it is pretty good.	2002-08-04

The consumer with the spare ticket to a ballgame or the unwanted vase used to have to sell it to a pro for pennies on the dollar, now he can have the full benefit of the resale.  The story of how it came to be is Adam Cohen's book.<br />From the early days as AuctionWatch, Cohen brings us inside the corporation, introducing to the players.  To the road trip for the IPO, where the myth of the &quot;Pez dispensers&quot; got started.  To the growing pains, to today.<br />But it is more than the executives that we meet.  We meet the members of the eBay community, buyers who add to their collections, sellers who use it as their way to reach the consumer, those who manage the message boards, or who liason with major sellers.  We understand the revolution that eBay has caused.  Items almost unobtainable are found with a simple search on eBay.<br />Yet we also meet those whom eBay have harmed.  Those who picked up items at flea markets and estate sales and turned them over to dealers to their mutual profit.  We may not have all that much sympathy for them--since their living was in getting people to sell their stuff for less than it was worth--but their case is presented to us.<br />One fault is that eBay's problems are softpeddled a bit.  We never do find out who was responsible for such problems as the great outages, and the other problems eBay has experienced.  Such soft soaping is the price you pay for insider access, I guess.<br />It will add to your understanding of what eBay hath wrought.	2002-08-03

Five daughters later, his estate is still slated to pass to a distant cousin, an obnoxious clergyman, because it can pass only to a man.  Had there been a son, something could have been done, but as it is, the daughters' only hope of avoiding eventual poverty is marrying well, for themselves and for their mother.<br />  Our focus is on the second daughter, Elizabeth.  More thoughtful than her sisters, she is her father's favorite.  We are not the only ones to like Elizabeth, the prideful and immensely wealthy Mr. Darcy also finds himself falling for her.  She rejects him because of the prejudice she has formed from his foster brother, the untrustworthy Mr. Wickham.  The rest of the novel allows us to watch as these characters manoever to finally get into a position where they can accept each other.<br />Absolutely stuffed with memorable characters and scenes.

So, with his fortune secure, in 1909, he visits England to make his home in the small village his ancestors came from. <br />  He falls into aristocratic company, and meets everyone from the King to Winston Churchill to Sir Harry Flashman.  Though he meets his future wife in that society, he eventually realizes that his wife isn't much better then the rest of the corrupt society.  Having found little silver and much tarnish in England, and with World War I drawing near, he must decide:  should he stay or should he go?  And besides, there's always that outlaw past, ready to try to bite him . . . <br />  Fascinating book, as Fraser displays an intimate knowledge of that era.  It wasn't always that easy to understand Franklin's motives, and easy sometimes to laugh at his naivete, but I guess I'm not as straight a shooter as he was.

He joins the Navy for no good reason except to impress a girl, and misadventures his way through his officer training. Slowly, he learns that this is more than a game, and learns to face up to the consequences of his actions, as he turns down a cushy position at Pearl Harbor, staying on the appalling Caine. But the arrival of the slightly warped Queeg both in some ways matures Keith, so that he pushes himself for recognition from the odd captain, and retards his maturity in other ways, so that at the pivotal moment of the mutiny, he joins in for unworthy reasons. It is not until he is nearly killed (and, by the way, saves the horrific Caine) that he is finally willing to face up to himself and decide what is really worthy in his life.<br /> There are many unforgettable characters in this book, not so much Keith, but Queeg, of course, and Lieutenant Keefer, author and cad, who provokes the mutiny out of pique and then runs for cover, and Steve Maryk, the not-so-bright exec who is manipulated into the mutiny and pays by being court martialed and losing any chance of staying in the Navy after the war. And, unforgettably, the flyboy and lawyer, Lt. Barney Greenwald, who comes in to defend Maryk and sees everything for what it really is. Forced by professional duty to destroy Queeg to save his client, he is appalled by his own actions and responds with one of the great speeches in literary annals.<br />A classic.

All of Cordwainer Smith's short works together	At the age of thirteen, I fell on a beat up copy of Norstrilia, and fell in love with Smith's works.  I soon got a copy of &quot;The Best of Cordwainer Smith&quot; and it vanished on a summer camp trip.  It took me years to replace  it.  Imagine my delight to have all those loved stories in one (heavy) volume, unlikely to go astray!<br />  As you probably know, Smith was actually Dr. Paul M.A. Linebarger, a Johns Hopkins professor and specialist in Asian affairs.  He was a master of psychological warfare.<br />  His stories fit no easy category.  They are not fantasy, they are not hard science fiction, they are not alternative history.  They incorporate bits and pieces of Asian culture and myth.  They are often troubling, haunting.  &quot;The Dead Lady of Clown Town&quot; ends with most of its characters dead or with their minds wiped, yet it is a happy ending for all that, with Joan's views obviously spreading through the underpeople.  &quot;Under Old Earth&quot; is a fascinating tale, filled with allusions that must be beyond the scope of this note.  Even &quot;War No. 81-Q&quot;, the original version of which was written by Smith as a teenager, is an excellent story.  &quot;Alpha Ralpha Boulevard&quot; is simply one of the great SF short stories of all time.  I could go on, but . . . <br />The volume also includes the Casher O'Neill trilogy, that I had read of, but not seen before.<br />If you haven't read Smith before, this is how to buy his stories, so that you have them all.  If you have--well, again, you'll have them all.  <br />It's worth it.  Buy it.	2002-07-31

But he has the talking alien creature his multi-great-grandpop picked up on an alien world, now grown from a couple of feet long to the size of a small truck. When one day, a series of accidents causes Lummox to go for a destructive walk, the authorities really start to take notice of Lummox.<br /> Nicely done, and with interesting concepts interwoven throughout--the child who has divorced her parents and lives in a group home, with coercion in choice of career a grounds for such a divorce, is an example. Even the details are finely drawn--the governor of John Thomas's state is mentioned as looking at papers that will send his best friend to jail, then later in the book he is mentioned as being in a grand jury session.<br /> Heinlein is not as subtle as he might be in his race message, regarding Mr. Kiku, the official who manages the affair, along with much else beyond the stratosphere. While Kiku rails against a superior who asks him to appear on a children's show because he is black, and states that it is the job of the parents to teach race tolerance, Heinlein jumps into the job feet first by having Kiku be the one to learn tolerance about a snake-haired alien, even to the point of sharing a coat with the alien. While it is a fine message, it is so unsubtle that it might be too obvious to the juvenile reader.  But maybe it was what was needed in 1954.<br />I particularly enjoyed the character of Betty, the strong willed girlfriend of John Thomas. While she is so different from the average Heinlein fluffhead, there is a suggestion at the end that John Thomas is going to be the one who wears the pants in their house. While this is a message that might play well in 1954, it does seem to go against both their characters. This is arguable, though, as John Thomas is successful, during the book, in asserting himself over her at each point of crisis . . . Well, you be the judge. <br />All the same, it is a fine book. Well worth having on your bookshelves.	2002-07-30

Wonderful images of a time in Judaism gone by.<br />I do not find it limiting that Wouk writes from an Orthodox perspective (he assumes, for example, that only a man would wear a tallit, which is the Orthodox practice, but not the Conservative). Wouk was what he was, and I do not think he should have modified his book to an egalitarian perspective to satisfy the wolves of political correctness.<br />Well worth an annual read and a place on your shelf.	2002-07-30

His adventures, at school, and at camp, are a fun window on urban life in the twenties, and a slightly biting on the summer camps of that era.  But things really heat up when Herbie and pal Cliff need to return secretly to the city . . . <br />While kids would naturally interest themselves in Herbie, there is an adult story, of Herbie's parents and their business troubles, going on just beyond Herbie's nose.  This doesn't really hit Herbie, and the juvenile reader, until near the end of the story, but the adult reader can watch the subplot building until the resolution of all at the end of the story.<br />Well worth reading, perhaps not as great as Wouk's later books, but written with conviction, probably from his personal experience (at least as regards the school and camp scenes!).	2002-07-30

I remember reading a children's book about that in boyhood.  While most of that kind of book had a pivotal event (usually at Antietam or Gettysburg) that went the South's way rather than the North's, Turtledove posits a deliberate interference with history.  South African white supremicists come back from 2014 to interfere with history.<br />The book begins with the Army of Northern Virginia in winter quarters in early 1864 at Orange Court House, Virginia, somewhat licking its wounds after the Gettysburg campaign.  General Lee (one of our two viewpoint characters) is writing a routine letter to President Davis when he hears most unusual gunfire outside.  As events transpire, mysterious men (revealed later to be our futuristic South Africans) have come to offer him a virtually unlimited supply of AK-47s and ammunition for same.  <br />Almost from the start the South's leaders realize that there is something wrong here.  The guns are very advanced, and no known factory can have made them.  The South Africans' leader tells Lee, in confidence, about their futuristic origins.  But as the South makes good use of the guns, and secures its independence, the question still remains--what are the intentions of these men who saved the South?<br />As I mentioned, half this book is told from Lee's perspective; half from the perspective of Nate Caudell, a sergeant in the 47th North Carolina and (in peacetime) a schoolteacher.  Caudell turns out, though he never meets Lee, to be a pivotal character in what transpires.<br />As has been mentioned by other reviewers, there is a long spece in the middle when not much seems to happen.  I still found this time interesting.  Certainly, Turtledove is known for his military-based novels, but the middle part of the novel remains interesting to me.<br />I found it odd that the South's leaders were so willing to (at least temporarily, and to some extent) change their views on slavery when faced with modern-day volumes which considered slavery a horror.  Not one says, \\"Well, in that timeline, we lost the war, and our view was not heard.  We'll be writing the history books now.\\"  However, there had to be some goal for this book, beyond the mere victory of the South, and Lee's plan for the gradual elimination of slavery does as well as any.  With one side bearing AK-47s, how many \\"Civil War\\" battles could Turtledove have written about?  He was right to wrap up the South's victory relatively quickly, and move on to other matters.<br />Thank heaven Turtledove has resisted the temptation to write a sequel to this one.<br />One of the best alternate histories ever written.  Buy it.	2002-07-30

Morely finds himself in love with his landlady's daughter in the past, and must deal with threats both in the past and in the present.<br />This is Finney's finest, a gentle novel which nevertheless prompts us to give serious thought to the morality of the decisions we make. Morley's decision to treat the people in the past as more than images long dead in the present leads inevitably to his decision to question the rightness of the project he is engaged in, and to act on that decision.<br />....<br />A fine, fine book that I wish Finney hadn't spoiled with a sequel.

Not perfect, though. What use does the Admiralty have for all that wood? The pieces of trunk that are brought in are often thirty kilometers long and several hundred meters in diameter. The population of the Admiralty is only a few thousand. You do the math. One integral tree would have all the wood they'd need for centuries.	2002-07-29

That the seemingly airtight way Time and Again was ended could be reversed, for example. That Morley, given being sent to 1912 to prevent World War I and save his son, would not instead look up his 1912 self (surely still alive and not yet sixty) or at least Julia, and have them find a way to save his (their?) son. That would be an insurance policy in case Si failed in his mission, and Si is bright and curious enough to come up with this or a similar scheme--after all, it is not unlike the plot resolution to Time and Again.<br />Even though Finney was dying as this was published, I still have the feeling that the book is a setup for a never-written third book of a trilogy. The final chapter seems unresolved. Possibly, it was due to Finney's illness. But he was a great, if underrated writer--but this could have been better. Maybe he was writing to augment his estate.<br />I also feel that there is an excess of detail, that Finney is sort of showing off with the level of his knowledge (or research) about the past. Take the play to which a chapter is devoted, or the dances, etc.<br />Just an offhand thought--isn't Si sort of wasting himself in the 1880s by working as an illustrator? Why isn't he trying to invent the zipper or writing Gone With The Wind or doing something else that will assure his and his family's financial security?	2002-07-29

But it soon turns out that the professor is not the only one looking--there's the State Department, the U.N., some hoodlums (or doodlehums), and a pair of alien cops dressed as marsupials . . . <br />A fine science fiction mystery. All the clues are there for you to solve it before Fred does, but even if you don't try, it is an extremely engaging read.<br />A few quibbles: This is an earth which has built interstellar spacecraft, so we must be in the 21st century somewhere, but the technology (other than alien, and other than cryogenics) does not seem to have advanced from the mid-70's writing of the book. At least drop in a little technology! ....<br />Still a fine read, which I first enjoyed as a freshman in high school almost a quarter century ago, and I still do.	2002-07-29

Today, Jemmy Bloocher lives near one end of &quot;Destiny's Road&quot;.  Forced by circumstances to leave his home, he learns more about what goes on further down the Road, and eventually fulfills his desire to travel to the other end.<br />The ending is very staged and very unrealistic. Why can we assume that no one, in 27 years, would recognize fertile speckles at Swan Lake, and then have Jemmy assume that if he scatters speckles along the Crab, the next time there is a merchant/settler disagreement, the settlers will recognize and cultivate the speckles? It just doesn't make sense. Far more likely that some merchant, maybe one who has been a prole at the Windfarm, recognizes speckles plants on the Crab and takes appropriate action.  When that happens, the merchants will dig up every speckles plant they can find.  <br />Anyone notice that it was stated that outside the Crab, speckles are free--yet Jemmy and Harlow discuss that speckles have to be bought. Give me a break.  Niven should have gotten his act together and his world straightened out.  For that matter, a map would have been very useful to the reader.  <br />(this is a modification of my review posted three years ago, which is out there as &quot;A Reader from Fairfax, VA&quot;.

He's also responsible for a group of worlds known as the Koryfonic Empire, where his role is a bit more public.  Almost simultaneously, another Earth Magid dies (and Rupert must select his replacement) and the Empire is thrown into chaos by the assassination of the Emperor--and the heir cannot be found.<br />  It falls to Rupert to straighten all this out, and he influences the likely replacements to meet at a science fiction convention.  I should add that Jones' depiction of a SF convention and its inhabitants is the best I've read, with the possible exception of \\"Bimbos of the Death Sun\\".  The rather straightlaced Rupert is at a bit of a disadvantage, but soon rallies.<br />  This is far from a comedy, though.  Rupert makes mistakes.  Others pay with their lives for the mistakes, and Rupert is guilt-stricken.  As she is wont to do (see the attempted poisoning of the stepfather in The Ogre Downstairs for an example), Jones ignores the conventions as to who should live or die in a book--and she does it to good effect, as the deaths are necessary to the plot.<br />  This is an intricately painted novel.  You could almost believe that there were Magids, and an Empire, and a mystical place called Babylon.<br />  A number of chapters are told from the point of view of Maree Mallory, one of the candidates to be the replacement Magid.  She and Rupert start off hating each other--and well, you know the rest.  A final chapter is told from the perspective of a third character, and fills us in on events during the course of the novel that Rupert had no opportunity to witness.<br />  The book is slow-starting, and it can take a new reader a number of pages to figure out what is going on.  The first \\"Maree\\" chapter adds to the confusion a bit, since we do not know of her yet.  However, the book quickly takes off.<br />  Another original masterpiece by Jones.  How can she be so overlooked and Rowling so admired?  The fluff of the Harry Potter books is far worse than the solid, fascinating works that Jones turns out.	2002-07-28

He doesn't consider the possiblity that the first available body might be a woman, and, in fact, turns out to be his secretary, who was killed, unknown to Smith.<br />Smith soon hears the voice of Eunice, the secretary in his head (her head, actually).  Eunice guides Johann in what it is to be a woman.<br />OK, the sex is overdone, and frankly, the book could have used a good editor.  <br />This is not one of the Heinlein late novels where everyone will live along happily forever with Lazarus Long and his crew (and I mean forever).  Remember, this book's title is borrowed from Psalm 23 \\"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.\\"  That shadow is never far away in this book, but within it, Johann learns to live, not just exist, as he did before.	2002-07-27

Don't buy it, find it in the library and read it, then you won't have wasted any money.<br /> What frankly amazes me is that the same author who preached the necessity of being part of the human race in such books as Podkayne of Mars and Have Space Suit, Will Travel, now preaches the virtue (vice?) of extreme individualism to the point of paranoia and excessive selfishness in this book. It was said of Clark Fries that he was quite willing to blow up the universe just to hear the bang. These characters come awfully close.<br /> The plot, what there is, is simple. Two married couples shoot off on a dimension-travelling vehicle. They have a series of mild adventures, and are highly offensive to almost everyone they meet, including each other.  Dissatisfied with the \\"ideal\\" world they eventually find, they seek out Lazarus Long and are just as obnoxious to him.  Apparently being very obnoxious is a survival skill.<br />Noted for the \\"party\\" at which everyone from Jubal Harshaw to Her Wisdom to Podkayne Fries (well, I guess the Heinlein of 1980 couldn't bear to kill off ANYONE) shows up.<br />Despite the fine ideas of dimensional travel, Heinlein was a disappointment in this book.  Perhaps one reason, leaving aside the utterly unsympathetic characters, is that the Heinlein who taught that death is a part of life, and necessary so that the next generation can reach its fulfillment (exemplified in many of his juvenile novels, and most notably in I Will Fear No Evil) is no more.  From here on in, Heinlein will be digging up (almost literally) favorite characters from his earlier works, and grafting them on to Lazarus Long's family as immortals.  This is unworthy of Heinlein.<br />There are so many good ideas in this book that it is worth reading, and worth mourning for the Heinlein of the 50s and 60s who would have worked wonders with them.	2002-07-23

Kip Russell lives in average small town America with slightly eccentric father and loving mother, when he wins a space suit in a competition.  He rehabilitates same and is suddenly kidnapped and finds himself in an alien spaceship headed to the moon.  He teams up with a supergenius little girl and a friendly alien to defeat the aliens and save the world.<br />While this is a simple adventure story on its face, it has deeper levels.  First of all, there are discussions of science which are interesting and educational--look at where Kip figures to himself that they are really going to Pluto, and how he schemes to fill the cell he is in with water so he can float out the top.  <br />There are also social messages woven in.  Kip learns to appreciate his parents a bit more--to him, they are just \\"his parents\\", but through hints dropped several times in the book, we come to appreciate his father far more than for just, rather oddly, bundling up a box of small change and shipping it off to the IRS every April 15.  Even if we were not explicitly told about Mr. and Mrs. Russell towards the end (and, frankly, I wish we weren't, it is too unsubtle), we would come to appreciate them for the way they steered Kip to maximize his potential.  However, they were less successful in making Kip a social individual, and that is what starts to change during the novel.<br />At the start of the novel, Kip displays really good relations with adults, but limited, and not so good, relations with his peer group.  Kip starts out a bit of a loner--he has friends, but none seem really important to him (certainly no one helps him in Oscar's renovation).  At the end, he's more assertive and, having identified himself with humanity in the climactic scene, may have found himself quite a bit more.  I suspect there's a lesson for Heinlein's juvenile readers there, many of whose spiritual home was in the stacks of the library.  Nothing wrong with that, but . . .   Heinlein manages this better than he does in Glory Road, where Scar comes home, wins the lottery, kicks sand on the bully, etc., etc.<br />A good read, but then go back and read it again.	2002-07-23

Few of us will ever forget the events of September 11, where we were, how the nation reacted.  Tony Rennell tells us of another earthshattering event, for its time, the death of Queen Victoria.<br />  Beginning a few days before the Queen's death, Rennell proceeds slowly through her final illness, providing enough background to satisfy us without boring us.  After the Queen passes, he gives us ample reaction to the death, even printing (rather pompous by today's standards) poems and songs written at the time (interesting to compare them with the songs written after September 11).  He brings us through the funeral and burial at Windsor.<br />Rennell tells us what was not widely known before--that Victoria was buried holding a picture of John Brown and a locket with his hair, and wearing a ring he had given her.  He is careful to put this in the proper context, devoting an appendix to setting forth his view that Brown and the Queen had an entirely proper, though unconventional, relationship.<br />Rennell puts the event in historical perspective--the conflict between those who wanted a \\"proper\\" amount of mourning, and those who wanted to move on quickly, reopen the theaters, put off mourning dress.  I wonder how long it has been since the general public wore mourning for a monarch, and if there will be any expectation that it be done next time.  Yet in 1901, the period of public mourning was shortened to \\"only\\" six weeks!<br />This book was published before 9/11, but I wonder, if, in 2101, a similar book will be published to remind the public of our watershed event.<br />Well worth reading.	2002-07-23

On a South Seas cruise vacation, he goes on a shore excursion, accepts a foolish bet to walk on live coals, and as he finishes, faints, and wakes up returned to his cabin--on a much more liberal world. The only good things he finds is cabin attendant Margarethe, who winds up with him as they are shuttled from Earth to Earth, each one changed from the last. Everytime they seem to be making some sense (or some money), they are send on to the next Earth, where their money is worthless, of course. And Alex finds his worldview challenged repeatedly.<br />It's easy to laugh at Alex's views. Yet there is substance to him from the start--he was able to walk that fire pit and \\"hold the thought.\\" His strength through the trials is remarkable. And he is finally able to stand up and go beyond his beliefs in a Heavenly City in which he has received the exact letter of his bargain--and no more (frankly, Heinlein owes a lot to Twain's \\"Visit of Captain Stormfield to Heaven\\"), and then again, in a divine, thought provoking, meeting.<br />Heinlein draws on his extensive palatte for finely painted scenes, from a cruise ship to a memorable visit to Hell, and challenges all our beliefs in a reasonably inoffensive manner. Well worth reading, and then rereading, as you will see references you missed the first time.	2002-07-13

The remaining British have become \\"red\\",....<br /> Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the novel is the \\"multiple vote\\", which, when it was mentioned at the last SF convention I attended, immediately provoked a half-hour debate. Democracy has been modified, leading to the possibility of earning additional votes in elections... <br />OK, so Shute didn't forsee the rise of republicanism in Australia and the Parti Quebecois in Canada. And television is mentioned exactly once, there's no satellite transmissions, and a lot of other similar difficulties. All the same, Shute provides an interesting political novel/love story for us. <br />I withhold a fifth star on this one because I don't find the character of David Anderson believable. This guy's supposed to be a quarter-Abo born in a ditch who came up through the ranks. He talks like an Oxford grad, and knows a fair number of polysyllables. Not only this, the quarter-Abo, discussing how the Queen should allocate her time if all was fair, discusses the proportion based on the overall population of the Commonwealth, and based on the white (!) population. Shute should have avoided these obvious howlers.	2002-07-12

Much information, about relatively small cities, even, if they would be of interest to Westerners.<br />A few faults. First, more maps are needed. Yes, I know Japanese don't always name their streets, but they could be based on landmarks. If you choose to visit one of the smaller cities covered, say, Takayama, you will do so without a Fodor's map (get one at the Tourist office, usually by the train station).  But even some large cities, which are extensively covered, like Kobe, do not have maps in the book.<br />Second, more hotels should be reviewed, and they might want to concentrate on the sort of hotel you'd book online.<br />Third, there's a certain incompleteness about the text. For example, they list the three top gardens in Japan. You will find that only two of the cities are listed in the index. For the third, look in vain.<br />Still, I recommend it.	2002-07-07

Needless to say, the arcology, which is quite successful and productive, is the target of protesters.  When three protesters sneak into the works of the arcology, and make it appear that they are going to blow up crucial equipment, two of them get killed for their trouble.  L.A. insists on the arrest of the Todos Santos manager who ordered them killed.  Todos Santos (the point of the Oath of Fealty of the title is that responsibilities and loyalties run both up and down)seek to get him out by whatever means necessary.<br />While it is an interesting concept, there is a problem--this is very much a one-note melody.  Niven makes the point that people living in such a structure would be different from what we are used to, and he makes it, and makes it until you're tired.  And while the Todos Santos people are clearly all saints, fighting the good fight, you're left wondering what would happen if they were using the many resources at their disposal in a less worthy cause . . . <br />Still, a good read, with interesting characters, and it leaves you thinking, which is always a Good Thing.	2002-07-07

He soon hooks up with his old teacher (Prof)and rabblerouser Wyoming Knott, and the four begin plotting Lunar revolution. How they motivate a nonpolitical populace into a necessary revolution (for, otherwise, the population faces disaster), is the tale. And how a computer which runs most things can be a big help to revolution is integral to the story.<br />As usual in Heinlein's better works (pre-1970), he mixes science and political science into the story in generous measures. His depiction of a lunar society which evolved from a \\"Botany Bay\\" style prison camp, where people learned to be inoffensive within the society or else died, is very believable.<br />Richly drawn, without the paranoia and hate Heinlein would exhibit in most of his later books, it is well worth reading and possibly Heinlein's best.	2002-07-05

When Dr. Theodore Honey, a boffin of an aviation scientist, predicts that the wings on a new type of aircraft will begin falling off, he is sent across to Canada to investigate a previous crash.  Bad choice--he is so unimpressive that when he learns that the aircraft he is on has already exceeded his estimated time to failure, he can only stop the flight by wrecking it when it stops to refuel at Gander.  Almost everyone believes he's crazy except for a few--including the assistant director at his place of work, a stewardess, and a movie actress.  <br />Shute is at his best in his characterizations--such as Monica Teasdale the fading American movie actress, who falls in love with Honey as she once did with a man before she became famous.  She soon realizes she can never have Honey and must step aside for the stewardess, who can give him children and maintain him in his work, as well as give him love.  The details are amusing--the actress, from Indiana, uses the word \\"hoosier\\" to the mystification of the British characters<br />As in most of Shute's books, there are no villians.  The fact that many of the characters are working against each other does not make any of them evil, and when the truth is revealed, they quickly begin to work together.  <br />For the information of readers, the book made a fairly poor movie starring (I kid you not), Jimmy Stewart as Honey.  But as so few of Shute's books were made into movies, it is worth watching for that reason.	2002-07-05

He throws himself into the business and makes a success of it.  The business really takes off after he hires childhood friend Connie Shaklin as chief engineer, and soon after, Connie's sister Nadezna, as his secretary.  But Cutter soon notices--Shaklin is giving semi-religious talks as he works, which are attracting attention and support not only from his co-workers, but from the Arab population, as they previously did in Cambodia, and when Shaklin is forced to go to Indonesia, again, he attracts attention and support, somewhat to the confusion of Cutter, who nevertheless is unfailing in his support of Shaklin, who seems to be beginning a religion that crosses religious boundaries.<br />Shute's most thought provoking of novels, as a new prophet arises in the form of an aviation engineer who adamantly denies he is a prophet, somewhat to the confusion of his friend and his sister.<br />Even the small characters (a gunrunner who, in seeing Shaklin and his work, is reminded of the small town and church in the Midwest where he grew up, for example) are finely drawn.  And Shute often gets rather subtle--Cutter, whose first name is Thomas, three times denies Shaklin's divinity in a talk with the British officer, Captain Morrison.<br />Beautiful and gentle work by a master storyteller.

She and her brother, Clark, an eleven year old amoral supergenius, are being raised by two distracted parents on Mars, but are closer to their Uncle Tom, a (seemingly) retired politician.  They wind up in Tom's care on a tour to Venus and Earth.  However, Tom seems busy with other things, meeting important people, etc.  The kids are left to their own devices.  Between the vortex around Tom, and the kids' natural tendencies for mischief, trouble is inevitable.<br />As has been pointed out in other reviews, this is really Clark's story, his evolution from amoral supergenius to a point where he is starting to care about other beings.  There are alternate endings, one was not thought suitable and Heinlein was forced to edit it, now both are in the book.  But both endings show Clark starting to care about others than himself.  And this is really the point.<br />Clark is the sort of kid that most of Heinlein's preteen target audience would be just delighted to be.  The kids who read Heinlein weren't much interested, at that point in their development, in sports or girls.  A rather evil electronics genius who outsmarts adults with impunity, reprograms food robots to serve him unlimited free snacks, and outsmarts a casino, is just what these kids would like to be.  While no doubt such a reader would take some interest in Podkayne as necessary to the plot, they would be most interested in Clark's antics.<br />Yet Clark makes mistakes, through overconfidence in his genius, and those mistakes have consequences for himself and Podkayne, in either ending.  He owns up on this to Tom, who \\"is gentle with\\" him, as Clark wishes Tom would hit him.  Clark realizes, and his readers realize with him, that there is such a thing as adult responsibility for mistakes, that you just have to live with, and that cannot be erased by a spanking.  Clark will just have to live with the consequences of his mistakes.  From what we can tell, this is a first for Clark, and it seems to change him a bit, giving us hope that Clark will be an adult who is able to exist within society.  He is able to care emotionally for Podkayne, and for the small pet she has adopted and protected, Ariel, and who he cares for physically as her surrogate.<br />This is a coming of age story not for Podkayne, whose personality changes little though the book, but rather for Clark.  Doubtlessly, few of the preteen readers realized it at the time, but they probably did in rereading as adults.<br />Not his best, but still, very, very, good.	2002-07-03

The end is less than a year away, yet Australians, and a few American naval refugees seek to maintain their daily lives in the face of doom, and even send an exploratory submarine northwards.<br />  The fascination of the book is watching how people react to the inevitable doom.  Many just go on plegmatically, a few pretend it will never happen.  Most interesting is Moira Dawson, an Australian girl who had dreamed of visiting London and Paris, and now never will, and who seeks to live what little life is left to the fullest. She learns a lesson from a stillborn romance with Dwight Towers, the submarine commander who acts as if his wife and children are alive in Connecticut.<br />  Perhaps the limitation of this book is that most of the characters simply accept their doom, presumably having come to terms with it before the start of the book.  But more of a range of viewpoints might be welcome.  Could you imagine the anger and frustration of teenagers under these circumstances, in the throes of adolescence without the promise of adulthood, knowing they will never have their independence.<br />  As in most of Shute's later works, there are no villians.  That is welcome when so many books have paper villains for us to vicariously hate.	2002-07-03

Strachan acts as her trustee, dispensing money as needed under the will, but the old lawyer soon finds himself falling for the young lady.  Before Strachan has done more than shown her London's culture, Paget is off to Malaya to repay the village where she stayed during WWII by digging a well.  She convinces Strachan to release the money by telling the story (based on real life) of how she and other women were held prisoner by the Japanese, but eventually found refuge in a small village.  Before they go there, they encounter a young Australian, Joe Harmon, who is crucified for stealing food for them.  When Paget returns to Malaya, she learns that Harmon survived and returned to Australia.  Meanwhile, Harmon has gone to England to seek her, having thought she was married when they met in Malaya.  They eventually meet up in Australia (Strachan, out of his own love for Jean, has gently attempted to frustrate the meeting).  Jean, determined to make her home in Harmon's home area, sets out to make the godforsaken town into &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot;--a modern town like Alice Springs.<br />It is a fascinating story.  But overlooked in every review I read is the role of the old solicitor, Noel Strachan, who finds himself in love with Jean some decades too late, and is unable to serve as a rival to Joe Harmon.  He soon surrenders his unexpressed (even to himself) love out of regard for Jean's interest.  His unrequited love, lends a poignant note to the book.<br />There are no villains.  Even the dark characters, like the Japanese who crucified Harmon, are seen as human beings doing the best they can.  The fact that the acts they do can be terrible do not alter the fact that they are human beings, and they are painted as such.<br />Harmon and the other Australian characters are not painted as well as the other characters; perhaps Shute, who had only recently emigrated to Australia, was afraid of erring in characterizations.<br />Still, a fine book that made a great miniseries.	2002-07-03

In the former case, there is an incident in common--the tale of the crew member who dislikes Martians and goes after him out of sight of others, and mysteriously vanishes.  In the latter case, there is mentioned in Podkayne a Martian Revolution against Company offices.  These are merely common incidents, this is not a prequel/sequel to either.<br />The plot has been detailed in other reviews, and I won't waste ink on it. It should be noted that after Heinlein's death, certain paragraphs that were stricken by Heinlein's editors at Scribner were reinserted. They don't add much to the plot, but are interesting to read--a discussion of gun rights, in which Heinlein alter-ego Doc MacRae expounds on the right to carry a gun, a short passage at the end in which we are told Willis will remain in pupahood for many years, until long after Jim is an adult, and a few other short passages.<br />This is a very good adventure book, with the kids showing resourcefulness and spunk to evade capture and/or death. It is less serious than other Heinlein juveniles--no \\"good guy\\" dies, for example. We are taught about loyalty, the importance about carrying out one's word and the importance of respect for the community, among many other virtues.<br />A few quibbles--what is on Mars that makes it profitable to have it run by Earth-bound corporations? Seems like Heinlein's ignoring economics to make his points.	2002-07-02
US	53021293	R2VN5VZUZ9RVRZ	0345330137	387028775	Double Star	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Fine and thoughtful novel of future politics	This is one of Heinlein's four Hugo-winning novels. A rather lightweight actor is shanghaied away from Earth and more or less forced to impersonate a kidnapped politician. As he understands what the politician stands for, he falls more willingly into the role. The politician is recovered, but in such condition that the actor must remain in the role, and when the politician dies, adopt it for life.<br />Lorenzo's transformation from lightweight actor to Churchillian libertarian politician is interesting to watch, and the science fiction is not essential to the plot--the Empire could, with some plot modifications, be in Roman times, or the British Empire, or in the twentieth century.<br />Two problems: We see two sorts of characters we encounter too often in Heinlein's later books here--the two-dimensional female (Penny) and the yammerhead (Bill). It strains credibility that someone like Bonforte would tolerate someone like Bill near him for several years (sure, he does good work, but surely there would be thousands of nicer competant people available to a high-level politician), but the plot needs a bad guy close enough for the readers to focus on. But we see too many Pennys and Bills in the later Heinleins. Second problem: Heinlein's parliamentary system is ill-thought out. Wouldn't the Grand Assembly be heavily dominated by Asians? Yet, all of Bonforte's associates are American or English. (I don't think we even see an Asian, other than the Emperor's attache. Where's Quiroga from? South America?) How is it, in a Grand Assembly where the districts must have the population of New York City (say, 800 members, 8,000,000 per district), that there can be \\"pocket boroughs\\"--districts for space pilots, and university women, and a district for Lapland? And, would these districts be content to have their representatives be Mr. Bonforte's secretary and crew?<br />Still, a great book.	2002-07-02

Thorby is damaged goods, psychologically, and the anger within from unresolved and repeated traumas never far from the surface.  Yet we can identify with this boy, because we see in him what we all know to be true--you can never go back.  Thorby repeatedly finds acceptance in the four society he experiences--as beggar, crew member on a Trader, crew member on a military vessel, and as a playboy on Earth.  Three times he is forced to move on by events beyond his control.  The final time, he chooses to fight those who would control him and take on the job of corporate magnate.  He is not satisfied with the result-- he wants to go back into the military, or follow in Baslim's footsteps--but we know (and, in his heart, he knows) he will never have that opportunity, and will have to find peace where he is.  The ending makes it clear he is moving in that direction.<br />Some have complained about Heinlein glorifying tribalism by making Sisu, a ship where if you are not of the people, you are filth, seem like such a nice place.  I think he's using an extreme example to make kids think about their own tribe--nation, religion, whatever--and how they and their family members treat non-members of that tribe.<br />A fine, fine book about the growth of a boy into manhood.	2002-07-02
US	53021293	R3BLCJJRKLCXET	031286860X	106877023	Ender's Shadow (The Shadow Series)	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Very fine, though limited by earlier book	It's often interesting to view a great work from another viewpoint, as Stoppard did with \\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\\" to \\"Hamlet\\". \\"Ender's Shadow\\" does much the same, to nearly as good an effect.<br /> Bean is an interesting character, but the book is most interesting when we see the reflected glory of Ender and we get to see that much loved character from another viewpoint. The scenes before and after Ender are missing something, and the something is, Ender. Card created three great characters in this series: the Wiggins siblings. When one of them is not on stage, they are missed greatly.<br /> Stoppard used snippets from Hamlet to highlight the helplessness of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, lost in events far greater than them. Bean, though, is supposed to be a dynamic character, shaping events, not merely being part of them. Card's problem is that the scenes and words already written in Ender's Game straightjacket him in this one--we have Bean say things which are perfectly appropriate in Ender's Game, but not consistant with his character here, and so he is forced to have Bean rage in his own mind about saying the wrong thing. Similarly, the adults, Anderson and Graf, make it abundently clear in Ender's Gamethat there is no alternative to Ender, no one who could possibly compare to him. Ender's Shadow forces Card into a \\"Yes, but . . .\\" in writing these characters and their conversations which start most of the chapters.<br /> Excellent, and I'm hoping for great things when the third book comes out in August. But in this volume, Card did the best he could in trying to reshape a Hugo-winning book that would be intimately familiar to his readers. For all my carping, few could have done better.	2002-06-30

Interesting concepts (such as Gerrold's particular Beanstalk concept) are mixed with science lessons (the physics of same) in a classic Heinlein manner, though the first third of the books.<br /> But as the novel slows and approaches an end, Gerrold appears to move to Heinlein as of the '70s and '80s--the sort of novels with a few \\"good guys\\" whom you'd better like through thick or thin, and a bunch of \\"yammerheads\\". The example of this is Howard the Lawyer, a singularly unsuccessful lawyer with all sorts of unfortunate attributes who we get to laugh at (Gerrold makes it really, really, clear that he hates lawyers in all three books of this series). For some reason, this worthless lawyer, who couldn't win a case if he tried, is hired to represent the interests of multitrillion dollar corporations. But plot shouldn't get in the way of Gerrold getting us to share his petty hates.  All is made right through a judge who will only enforce the rules against one side--which is very much a Heinleinian thing to do, but it is not a good lesson for kids. But as we are supposedly rooting for Charles and friends, it may not bother you much.<br />I'm not going to bother to write reviews for books 2 and 3, but book 2 is a combination of The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Have Space Suit--Will Travel--which does little credit to either. Book 3 combines the flashback \\"high school class\\" scenes of Starship Troopers with Gerrold's attempt to get to the conclusion on his own. It sort of trickles out for no apparent reason except that there are no more pages.<br />Gerrold always has good ideas. But this time, good ideas just weren't good enough.	2002-06-09

Even in the dying pages of the series, he finds room for a most intriguing new species. However:<br />I think that Hamilton bit off more than he could chew with the various problems he gets the human race in, and sees no other way out than a rather simplistic, deux ex machina solution whereby a wand is figuratively waved and everything is made all better. It is sad, and as I looked at the pages of the book dwindling to the right, and realized that the characters were not coming up with anything on their own, I knew this would happen.<br />Hamilton seems to have trouble with endings--Fallen Dragon is another example. Maybe he'd do better to stick to open ended series, where nothing need ever be truly shut down?	2002-05-07

Alas, however, the book slows down in endless flashbacks to the main character's past--at first intriguing, but soon (especially once he leaves his home planet), you just want to get past them and get on with the main story. <BR> The story contains intriguing technology, interesting worlds, but the ending disappoints. \\"Starship Troopers\\" becomes \\"By His Bootstraps\\". It's just one deus ex machina after another, until the end. <BR> Hamilton, apparently a Brit, is not careful about using an excessive numbers of British expressions, with people who have no known British connection. He should be more careful. or else explain how English conquered the American language . . . <BR>It's good reading, and I'll read more of his. But it could have been better.	2002-04-06

An unjust peace is imposed on a proud country, with shrunken territory, loss of most armed forces, and crippling reparations.  Then, a war veteran who served as a noncom starts a new party, as the country experiences hyperinflation.  The party has a uniform, a two-syllable chant, and blames the War Department and a minority group for losing the war.  Riots soon ensue, and a temporary (no doubt) setback for the Party.  But here, it is not Germany, it is the Confederate States.  We await with dull anticipation the rise of power, Riechstag fire, Olympics, Rhineland (US-occupied Northern Virginia, no doubt), Munich Pact, and finally, the Second Great War, all certainly coming in future books, it is just a question of how many books.  We'll be shelling out a few bucks before Jake, I mean, Adolf, I mean, Jake, hits the bunker.   The politics are the most interesting point in this book.  I could have wished that Turtledove had done as he did in &quot;Guns of the South&quot; and published the election returns, state by state, for his US election of 1920 and CSA election of 1921.     Turtledove has certainly written another page turner.  I wish, however, he would come up with a new idea as innovative as time-traveling Afrikaners in &quot;Guns of the South&quot;.  Maybe he could do something with the Revolutionary War or War of 1812, and build a new world from there.    In summary:  Better than the Great War books, worse than &quot;How Few Remain&quot; and not even close to &quot;Guns of the South&quot;.  The WorldWar books with the aliens, I gave up on halfway through the third, so I can't compare it.	2001-08-03

In Ender's Shadow, Card takes a relatively minor character, Bean, and gives us a new focus on Ender.  It works reasonably well because we love Ender.  Bean would probably not be worth writing about himself.    Yet, Card insists on doing so in Shadow of the Hegemon.  Bean dominates, along with Petra and Achilles, two characters we could, frankly, care less about.  They are cardboard cut outs.    Peter, Peter, is the character we want to see, now that Valentine and Ender are out of the picture.  Yet we see little of him.  The book lurches suddenly to life, albeit briefly, when an adolescent Peter slides into a seat beside Bean and his mentor, Carlotta.  The momentum is too soon lost.    Card reveals in the epilogue that he allowed the Petra/Achilles storyline to capture him, and postpone the Peter/Bean interaction to another book.  Our loss, and our waste of money.  The book is a shadow, and no Hegemon.	2001-07-07

Francis's work falls into two categories, the early, rather short novels tied closely to racing (Bonecrack is an outstanding example) and his later work, much longer novels, many dealing with the details of professions (banking, diplomat, architect) with some connection to horse racing.  With his wife's death, who researched (and, let's face it, probably more or less wrote) the later books, this should be it for this writer.<br />  The hero here is your standard plucky, competent Francis hero.  People talk to him to an incredible extent--in fact, when we meet someone who won't talk to him, that person is almost per se villianous.  Like many another Francis hero, he meets his lady love in the course of the book, a one dimensional woman cop.  If you don't see the words &quot;f--k the police&quot; in this book, don't worry about it.  It happens a lot.  No need to say it.<br />  I don't want to go too deeply into the plot, such as it is.  Like any other Francis hero, this hero refuses to get the police involved--particularly strange since our hero is in bed with the police, literally.  If you think about the book (I don't advise it) after reading it, this refusal has tragic consequences.  Oddly, the hero never seems to realize that.<br />  A strained premise, unrealistic villians (including one who you would have no way of knowing was a villian until Francis reveals it in the last twenty pages), and a paper hero.  On top of that, Francis uses the unworthy tactic of having his hero know things, and tell the reader he knows things, that he does not reveal to the reader.  Thus, you cannot solve the mystery until all is revealed.  Great mystery writers give you all the clues and the opportunity to put it all together.  Francis was once a great mystery writer.  He isn't now.	2000-10-17

Usually, they are  essential to the plot.  I didn't care for, however, the gang rape of the 16  year old which occurs barely offstage, since it could have been excised  without affecting the plot.  But more than that, the plot is confusing and  unfocused.  Having looked at (it is hard to say &quot;read&quot;) her Dark  Guide to Fantasyland, or whatever it is called, I think Jones wrote this to  poke fun at D&amp;D, and it really didn't work.  She's far better when she  starts from a blank canvas--her recent &quot;Deep Secret&quot;, while  including equally disturbing elements (the murder of three young children,  for example), was a wonderful book, and those murders were essential to the  plot and to the character development of at least one main character.	2000-01-20

The character of Bean is rather altered from Ender's Game, and that is a little  frustrating.  There are conversations that Card must adhere to, and he  makes them fit Bean's new character by making Bean say things that don't  really fit his new character and excusing them, more or less on the grounds  that Bean is nervous in the presence of his idol Ender.     The light seems  to go out of this book when Ender leaves Battle School, and things are more  or less stretched along until the climax.   OK, there has just got to be a  sequel, and one event happens at the end of the book which is totally  unnecessary to the plot if there was to be only one book.  It sets up a  sequel, which is needed anyway to resolve Bean's medical problems (which  aren't too necessary to the plot, either, if there was just going to be one  book, it wouldn't be necessary to have them)  I welcome the sequel if it  will feature Peter Wiggins in his rise to become Hegemon, and Valentine as  well.  But I think we all know they will.  I imagine there will be a third  book, perhaps ending when Ender's Game ends.     Good, but perhaps better  named &quot;Only a Shadow of Ender's Game&quot;.	1999-09-08

If you know that good and evil are mixed in all, keep  reading.<br />In these books, you can safely assume that good and evil will  remain separated forever.  Each character contains one and only one of the  two.  I'm not counting pre-adolescent hijinks, which the good characters  indulge in, as evil.<br />Not to contradict myself, but there are a few dark  tones in the good characters--but these seem to be because the author has  overlooked it or not had enough moral character to realize the problem.  For example, why has the headmaster permitted a certain individual to  remain unjustly accused and convicted for fifty years?  It doesn't speak  well for &quot;the greatest wizard&quot;.  This is beyond the ken of the  11-year-olds the author is shooting for, and so goes overlooked.<br />The  author plays to the prejudices of the 11 year olds.  The fat are treated  cruelly--they sit on items and break them, or have their clothes falling  down, anything for cheap laughs.  Needless to say, none of Harry's friends  are fat.<br />  The logic puzzle in the first book is useless, since the  reader cannot see the bottles--it is necessary to know the position of the  largest and smallest bottle for a full solution.  However, the reader is  not supposed to solve the puzzles in these books, I think.  In the second  book, a character's name (including the middle name, never previously  given) form an anagram of another's, PLUS THE WORDS &quot;I AM . . .  &quot;.  No way for the clever reader to solve it, he is never given all  the clues.<br />Quiddish is a nice idea.  However, the author has not been  able to come up with new ideas for the game, and in the second book, it is  mostly ignored.  Kudos to the author for coming up with the minor character  of the quiddish captain, noble but obsessed, might have come straight out  of Tom Brown's Schooldays.<br />The author might have been smarter not to try  to describe the elements of magic society in the second book.  All are  extraneous to the plot, and lend themselves to contradictions (what WERE  the consequences of the sighting of the flying cars?)  The author could  have just concluded that a pre-adolescent wouldn't see or understand much  of it, and let it go.<br />  As far as I can see, we're being set up for a  final confrontation with the Dark Side, which should please the young  readers, and a love triangle, which should bore them out of their minds.  I  hope the author makes the characters more interesting and fallible, the  villians a bit nicer, some interesting ideas, and a better editor (at one  point, &quot;ancestor&quot; is used where &quot;descendant&quot; is  meant).<br />  By the way, shouldn't these kids learn a little algebra and so  forth at Hogwarts?
