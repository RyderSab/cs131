Her father is concerned about money, Loni is concerned with herself, and Persis's mother is concerned with appearances. As a  result, Persis is constantly put down and mistreated. She begins to take  control when a sleazy diamond and ruby brooch, one of Loni's wedding gifts,  goes missing, and Persis becomes involved in a tangle of lies meant to get  her sister out of trouble. In the end, the brooch is found, Loni finds some  independence, and Persis receives recognition from her parents; and not  only that, but she has come to understand them better. It sounds like a  happy ending, and it should be, but it's not. The book is a fast and  entertaining read, but it's shallow. The changes at the end are too tenuous  and come too fast to mean anything; the reader cannot even pretend that  they do, for that would entail caring about the characters, which is  difficult when they are obviously Bad, or even when they are obviously  Good, (i.e., Persis). The book is pervaded with an atmosphere of  wish-fulfillment and self-centredness, which, while true to life, is not  really likeable. There's no point in sympathizing with people who are  already sympathizing with themselves enough for two. As a result the reader  comes to the end only to seriously ask herself, &quot;What was the  point?&quot;	2000-05-11

And I found that the deeper I  got into the book, the more interested I became; and not only interested,  but awed by Dostoyevsky's skill. Clear-headed and sensible people who have  never felt terrified and arrogant and confused will no doubt find this book  pointless, as will those who dislike thinking, but the fact remains that  this book is a work of art, which I heartily recommend to all.	2000-01-05

The reader will easily see why. Vathek kills casually, his mother Carathis positively gleefully; they hold traffic  with evil spirits, Carathis raising them up when necessary. What they do,  they do to gain access to the Palace of Subterranean Fire. This story moves  along well, with plenty of darkly humourous comments. The translation  process does not seem to have impaired the book's readability; if so, it  was probably due to the fact that Beckford and a colleague only worked on  it sporadically--Beckford kept on having to remove himself from England to  prevent unpleasantness. His tastes are reflected in his fiction.	2000-01-04

I was enraged, but read 'Cousin Henry' anyway. It was superb, and illustrates perfectly Trollope's own philosophy, given in  'Barchester Towers,' that a good book will not suffer even from the reader  knowing what happens. 'Cousin Henry' has other, and considerable, merits,  than suspensefulness--although it is suspenseful. It has been called the  most psychologically probing of Trollope's works; indeed, Trollope himself  thought it to be so, and was very proud of it. The plot, in brief, and  without giving anything away, is this: Cousin Henry is the heir of the  Squire of Llanfeare--according to the will everyone knows about. But Henry  knows of another, later, will, that disinherits him. Most of the book  concerns Henry's agonizing over whether or not to make this will public.  There is also another plot thread, concerning the Squire's daughter,  Isabel, who can only marry if her husband is willing to take her last name  (shades of 'Cecilia'). I'll say it again: one of Trollope's best.	2000-01-04

Following each chapter's explanation is a problem set of 30 or so problems, which tests the student  on the latest concept and every single other concept covered so far.  Needless to say, doing the same kind of problems over and over and over  again gets very old. The one redeeming feature is Saxon's word problems,  which are inventive and sometimes (as I found against my will) quite funny.  Repetitive though the book is, though, it succeeds very well at teaching  the student basic algebra; no one can go through this book and not know the  material cold.	1999-12-27

In fact, they are  sick of her, she's so disgustingly violent and selfish (thanks largely to  their 'care'). Enter the Wise Woman, who steals Rosamund away underneath  her voluminous cloak and takes Rosamund to her cottage, which is miles away  from nowhere--and bigger on the inside than the outside. Here, for the  first time, Rosamund begins to learn that her wishes are not what the world  revolves around. Very slowly. Before that happens, however, she enters  another world through a picture and takes the place of another spoiled  brat, Agnes, daughter of a shepherd and shepherdess. Agnes takes Rosamund's  place. The Wise Woman does her best to save both girls, whose (to  paraphrase Burke) intemperate minds mean that they cannot be free; their  passions have forged their fetters. I can't tell you how the story ends,  however. You'll have to find out for yourself. <br />MacDonald writes in an  elegant, leisurely style (he takes three pages to describe a rainstorm at  the beginning), and the story is rather long for a story--a 100 pages, give  or take a few. But these are not really drawbacks. To adult readers, the  story is a rather obvious, but effective, allegory of God's offer of  redemption to humanity. To child readers, it is simply a good story; they  will probably miss the parallel, but get the message. The story is filled  with memorable scenes and images: the little cottage, the Wise Woman's  eerie song, Agnes in her bubble (in more ways than one), Rosamund losing  her temper with the little child in the boat. These make as much of an  impression as the ideas, especially the recurring one that it is not enough  to good; that's easily done when one's in a good mood. The goodness that  counts is that done against one's inclinations--a hard doctrine that  negates most of my good deeds, if nobody else's. <br />In short, this is a  haunting book. It is well-written, it is thoughtful, it stands up both as a  strong story and as a sermon, it entertains, it rebukes; it rewards  repeated reading with additional meaning.	1999-12-25

It is an unusually constructed history in three volumes, written by a word-class writer. It is a heavy read. In this volume, Solzhenitsyn describes arrests, interrogations, tortures, trials,  prisons, and methods of transporatation from the prisons to the labour  camps. He gives a brief history of the genesis of Gulag, its principles and  its expansion, in the chapter &quot;A Brief History of Our Sewage Disposal  System.&quot; Solzhenitysn marshalls an impressive range of facts and first  hand anecdotes in addition to his own experiences, usually relating them in  a straightforward manner, sometimes with bitter, vicious sarcasm, sometimes  with passionate anger. The book is an astounding achievement, especially  when one considers that he wrote it in sections, hiding each as it was  completed; he was never able to refer back to what he had previously  written, yet I noticed no repetitions. The book is an astounding  achievement, immensely powerful, but very depressing, sometimes  heart-breaking. Nonetheless, anyone who wishes to be well-informed in  general, or about history in particular, must read it.	1999-12-25

The opening story, &quot;The Terrible Vengeance,&quot; was  somewhat unfortunately placed by the editor, being a long melodrama about a woman pursued by her father's incestuous desire for her. The rest of the stories,  however, prove Gogol to be a great writer. &quot;The Overcoat,&quot; about  a very poor man who saves up for a new and badly needed overcoat, is based  on an anecdote someone told at a party; everyone laughed but Gogol, who  found the loss of the man in the story pathetic, not laughable. His version  is indeed pathetic, except for the end, which is completely different in  tone. &quot;The Nose&quot; has one of the greatest beginnings of any story  ever written: a barber comes down to breakfast, and, slicing through a loaf  of bread, sees something hard and white in it. He pulls it out and --it's a  nose! Gogol's gift for comedy comes out most strongly in &quot;Ivan  Fyodorovitch Shponka and His Aunt,&quot; which contains such priceless and  absolutely true statements as: &quot;He was nearly fifteen when he passed  into the second form where instead of the abridged catechism and the four  rules of arithmetic, he began to study the unabridged catechism, the book  dealing with the duties of man, and fractions. Realising, however, that the  further he progressed in his studies the more difficult they became&quot;  he quit school at the first opportunity and joined the army. The story is  full of such gems. Another good one is &quot;The Portrait,&quot; which,  like Gogol himself, is not held in nearly high enough esteem; in this  story, an artist named Chartkov buys a portrait of a man whose eyes seem to  be living. That night, as Chartkov lays in bed, the man in the portrait  steps out. From here, the level of tension steps up. The rest of the story  traces both the nature of the portrait and the change in Chartkov, as well  as offering Gogol's take on how to be an artist; more than talent and  practise is involved. These, and all the other stories, are related in  Gogol's best style, excellently translated by David Magarshack. Gogol  writes easily, in a colloquial, slangy style, with an good eye for people's  mannerisms and foibles; in these respects, he is like Dickens, with whom he  is often compared. Gogol is not nearly as much of an optimist, however.  None of these stories is heartwarming or ends happily; Gogol depicts the  less charming parts of life, and in depicting them, makes them sometimes  charming, sometimes amusing, and always interesting.	1999-12-25

Unlike, say, Victor of Aveyron, Kaspar was deliberately imprisoned for approximately twelve years, beginning from  the time he was about 4. At about age 16, Kaspar was suddenly and  inexplicably released and set loose to wander the streets of Nuremburg.  Anselm Von Ritter Feuerbach took the boy in and treated him kindly even as  he observed him closely, keeping a notebook on Kaspar. This notebook is  here printed in English for the first time, translated by Jeffrey Masson,  who gives a history of Kaspar's life after his release as well. At the age  of 19, two men tried to murder Kaspar; a couple of years later, they tried  again, stabbing him several times. He died three days later. Why was this  done? Apparently the rapid progress Kaspar had made in learning to both  speak and write German quite fluently and articulately, and especially the  memories that were beginning to come to the surface, posed quite a threat  to someone. Masson puts forward for an English speaking audience a theory  commonly found in Hauserian scholarship: Kaspar was the crown prince of a  small nation, switched at birth at the instigation of one Countess Louisa  in favour of her brat. Naturally, both the reputations and positions of  quite a few people depended on Kaspar's silence. Masson puts forward many  facts to support this theory; it would be well-nigh impossible to doubt  that this theory is correct, even though it sounds like one of Grimm's less  cosy fairy tales. Intriguing though all this is, however, the fact of  Kaspar's confinement looms over the book, making it impossible to get any  real enjoyment out of reading it. The description of Kaspar's life in a  tiny dungeon is disgusting and disturbing. If you are at all inclined to be  emotional, or if your life is not happy right now, I'm not sure you will  want to read this book--it can be very upsetting to think about (perhaps  that's why it's out of print). But maybe not. On the other hand, those  interested in psychology should definitely read this book whether they like  it or not--it'll be useful. I would recommend this book very heartily to  all if I myself had not been quite so upset by reading it; forget my  comments and judge it for yourself.	1999-12-25

He has twelve hours to plan a strategy.  The bulk of the book is given over to describing his third attempt to save himself. Sleator does a superb job of building up tension in this, his latest book; in fact, it would be superb all round, but for the intrusion of corny elements...A little more time and thought would have improved the book immensely, but such considerations enter the head only after whizzing through the book to find out what happens. Sleator has concentrated more on human relationships in this book than on flashy sci-fi devices such as phasers that transport one back through time--a definite improvement over some of his more recent books, and a welcome return. As always, Sleator's writing, though not flawless, is clear, concise, and blessedly free from gimmicky (and doomed) attempts to make the reader feel that he or she is thinking the main character's thoughts. Sleator is aware that he's no gourmet cook; he stays within his limitations to construct tense, fascinating little appetizers that are a cut above the too-common fast food served up by writers for children.	1999-12-24

The author finds himself, in this fantasy, taking such a  trip....&quot; with interesting results. Hell itself is  interesting--despite a previous reviewer's comments, Lewis's vision of Hell  is not quite the traditional one. Lewis in the book, once in Heaven,  becomes more or less a bystander, watching angels meet the others who have  taken the trip from Hell and trying to convince them to give up, again in  the words of the blurb, &quot;their most precious sins,&quot; those things  they insist on keeping even at the cost of eternal joy. Twerpy as that  seems, it becomes all too believable as encounter after encounter takes  place. These are superb. There is the Tragedian, who uses 'his manly,  bullying tone--the one for bringing women to their senses;' the chattering  woman; the man in the grip of lust, a little lizard--'I promise I won't do  it anymore. I'll give you nice dreams, sweet and fresh and almost innocent.  You might say, quite innocent...;' the Big Man; and (best of all!) the  Apostate Bishop, with his theory about Jesus, who was 'a comparatively  young man when he died. He would have outgrown some of his views, you know,  if he'd lived. I shall point out how this deepens the significance of the  Crucifixion...&quot;(point out, I should say, to his theology study group  in Hell). The descriptions are fantastic, the comments on target; even if  the reader doesn't agree with Lewis's views in general, he or she will  recognize human nature in the characters, drawn with a very steady and sure  hand.	1999-12-22

(Nat'l Inst. for Controlled Experiments) wants that part of Bracton College's land that is said to contain the body of Merlin. Mark Studdock is drawn into the N.I.C.E, whose temporary headquarters are  elsewhere, even as his wife Jane sees at first hand the things the N.I.C.E  is doing. The two follow different paths throughout the book, each on  different sides without realizing it. And it turns out that Merlin never  really died, and furthermore, really was buried at Bracton College....The  plot is much more complex than that, but that's the skeleton, stripped  completely of flesh so as not to give away any surprises. The  characterizations are good--some great. Jane is good--Mark is much better;  literature has seldom had such a likeable twerp. Feverstone, Curry, Dimble,  Ivy, the tramp, are all good. (McPhee, criticised as being 'unidimensional'  by a previous reviewer, is, ironically enough, based on a man Lewis knew  well.) Some of the best parts of the book are those that describe the  politicking that goes on at Bracton and at N.I.C.E, and amusing little  comments are strewn regularly throughout the text. However, the same  previous reviewer is right on the mark in saying that the change in Ransom  is both disappointing and unexplained, and I personally find some of  Lewis's remarks on men and women grating. Some are funny, as when Jane  wonders when Mark will really be back, thinking, 'for when men say that  they will be away two days they mean that that is the minimum, and they  hope to be away a week.'The way Jane despises women who shop for a new hat  to comfort themselves and then turns right around and does the same thing  is good too. What grates is the author's placid assumption, not that  masculinity is good, but that it is the highest good, and that good  spiritual beings grow more masculine as they grow more spiritual and  perfect. That sort of thing can be ignored, however, especially on the  second time through, and it's a rare reader who won't want ot read this  book again. And then again.	1999-12-22

Much of the book consists of descriptions of Malacandra, as it is known to those who live there--our name for it is Mars. Bigger things  are afoot, it is clear, but what won't be shown until 'Perelandra' and  especially 'That Hideous Strength.' The book has a chapter tacked on the  end, supplying some more details, supposedly written by Ransom to Lewis--a  clever touch; Lewis comes off as the colossal bungler, romanticising a  straightforward intellectual narrative, to Ransom's clear-headed scientific  observational approach--a spoof within a spoof, well and quietly done. The  scenes with Weston and the Oyarsa, Ransom translating, are priceless; Lewis  works in some sharp satirical comments against war and greed and pride.  Those scenes alone would make the book well worth reading. Add in the  strange and fascinating--other worlds and creatures and the memorable  descriptions of space itself--and you've got a book with double appeal.  True, the science is inaccurate--Mars has no 'hnau's and space is not  filled with light. Lewis is not to blame, however, especially for the  last--space _ought_ to be filled with light; no one knows why it isn't;  whole books (e.g., 'Why the Sky is Dark at Night') have been written on the  subject. Science aside, the book really has no flaws except that it doesn't  ever soar above its consistent level of quality.	1999-12-22

And, let's face it, LMM does tend to reuse plot elements, making sure, like one of her own thrifty characters, that she's getting all the wear out of her material. Even under these handicaps, however, some stories manage to shine. The book opens with one of the best in the collection, &quot;A Patent Medicine Testimonial,&quot; which is funny and stands out because of the way in which the heroine accomplishes her aim. &quot;Where There is a Will There is a Way,&quot; despite its prissily correct tile, is my favourite of the collection. It's a very simple, very short story about a boy whose guardian won't even let him take part in a debate, much less go to college. He defies her, humiliating himself deeply in the process, and in proving his mettle, wins his guardian's approval. Typical LMM, done in her best style. The last story in the book, &quot;The Strike at Putney,&quot; is a close second. The elders of Putney's church decide to improve on Paul and say that not only can no woman preach in church, she can't even give a missionary talk. The women thereupon strike. As one of the characters says, &quot;if women aren't good enough to speak in church they are not good enough to work for it either.&quot; It's a humourous take on the battle of sexes that raises some good questions about women's role in the church.  These three stories alone make the book worth buying, for they are sure to be read and reread.	1999-12-21

A black parent picks up the book his son brought home and lights on a certain word. From this, a battle over censorship begins. The students divide into two factions, as do the faculty and the community. Impromptu arguments in  the hallways are supplemented by debates. Hentoff relates everything in  such a way as to put forward many answers, while making his own strong  belief in the right to free speech clear. The opposition is, however,  portrayed very fairly--Kate is a prominent and sympathetic character. The  fight is not between the good and the bad, but between two groups whose  motives are both good; they disagree as to how things should be done and  how much power people should have over other people. A very  thought-provoking book that the reader will think about at random times for  years afterwards. Although in fiction form, this book is more like a  modern, YA version of a dialogue of Plato's. It isn't, perhaps, what one  expects--although the author's name should have been a tip-off. Kids who  like to think will love this book.	1999-12-21

He's told that he plays like he's never paid any dues; &quot;I didn't have it. I wasn't saying anything with my music. And worst  of all, I wasn't even the right color. For once, this wasn't anything I  could talk to my father about. He's white too, after all....&quot; All the  true greats in jazz have been black. Tom wants desperately to 'in' with  blacks, many of whom seem hostile to him. On the other hand, many whites  find it hard to believe that Tom actually wants to play jazz for a living  and don't take him seriously, or are violently racist. Tom's dogged pursuit  of jazz in the midst of his unhappiness and uncertainty wins out, sort of,  in the end. If you're not into jazz, the book will seem foreign. If you  are, you'll be right at home. Hentoff deals with the question of race  relations in his usual manner--no statements by him, no obvious slant,  even; he just lets his characters do and say things in character, and in so  doing makes his opinion clear while stimulating the reader's thought.	1999-12-21

Foucault is concerned with this change as it demonstrates  something pervasive and not just exclusive to the prison  system--normalization, or socialization. All the silly little things done  in schools, for instance, you will see in quite a different light after  reading this book. It's one of those books that--well, at the risk of  sounding supremely cornball, will open your mind. All mind-opening books  are painful, though, and this is definitely a painful read, mainly thanks  to Foucault's _terrible_ writing style. Apparently he wrote it in two days  straight with the aid of way too much coffee. (This is partly the  translator's fault--other translator's version are a [slight] improvement,  and when Foucault wrote in English he did a better job than any of his  translators. Slightly better, that is.) Be prepared for sentences within  sentences within sentences within sentences within sentences, none of which  are marked off by parentheses or dashes. Foucault uses commas very, very  lavishly, as some sort of all-purpose punctuation mark, and shies away from  periods as if they were the Plague. Eventually, you get used to it, though,  and the content is actually worth it.	1999-12-21

Over the basicframework of country mouse/city mouse, Alcott embroiders extensively, adding the themes of peer pressure, societal pressure, riches and their relation to happiness, the rights and proper roles of women, love, 'proper' behaviour vs. right behaviour, and vice-versa. But the story reads like a story, not a dissertation on philosophy. Polly is very human, and her family, though less-well drawn, is collectively a very human family. Tom, Fanny's brother, is the star of the book. &quot;An Old-Fashioned Girl&quot; is filled with humourous incidents, the number of which increases as one grows older. I first read this book when I was seven. I loved it then, when I only got a small part of it. I love it even more now. Those readers who dislike Alcott's moralizing will not love this book, but they will find it better than, say, &quot;Little Men.&quot; Ignore the character of Grandma, through whom Alcott voices most of her morals, and concentrate on Polly and Tom, and even the most cantankerous reader would surely, if grudgingly, admit that this book isn't half bad.	1999-12-21

Leo awakes with no  memory of what happened, and there is no trace of his friend Tim. His story  of what happened--&quot;I don't remember&quot;--sounds like a more than  ordinarly pathetic excuse, until a psychiatrist begins working on him to  recover memories. Strangely, those memories are not of what really  happened....This book lacks Sleator's usual  carefully structured plot--it  just flows along, helter-skelter. Also lacking is strong characterization  and the tensions between humans that Sleator usually works in as a  sub-plot, and that's quite a loss. But it's a good, fast-paced read, with a  eyebrow-raising twist at the end.	1999-12-21
US	50473411	RWK8V68F6NH9K	0030895162	147588699	The Four Donkeys	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Underrated	Another elegant bit of work from The Master Craftsman. Threemen on their way to market meet up with trivial disasters and end uphaving to trot back home, disappointed but wiser. The gentle little moral is a positive pleasure, the writing is superb, and the illustrations enhance the text without overshadowing it because the text stands on its own; it's not an excuse for visual creativity. Not for very little kids, but a great read-aloud book for kids with a fairly long attention span, and a great book for anyone older than that.	1999-12-21

Trixie is, of course, convinced that he is a fake, but no one believes her. As his behaviour becomes more  and more threatening, Trixie decides that she must convince the adults of  the truth, and the only way to do that is to search his room for evidence.  The story takes place near Halloween, and the whole atmosphere is decidedly  creepy. Definitely the most engrossing of the Trixie Belden series.	1999-12-16

She is standing at the top of a flight of stairs, blindfolded, and next to her some one is whispering, '99 steps. 99 steps.' Nancy begins investigations, and is promptly threatened. That  doesn't stop her from going to France, however. Alchemy, dreams, threats,  and a mysterious past make this one of the most Gothic and memorable of  Nancy's adventures. (P.S. This is a great one to read if you want to forget  that you have a cold or something. I read it when I had hives and it was a  life-saver.)	1999-12-16

Nancy, of course, takes on the case. She is distracted, however, by the rash of burglaries that have been taking place in the  neighborhood, and by the threats of the school bully. Secret passages,  gloomy graveyards, and Houdini style escapes make this Nancy Drew a  standout.	1999-12-16
