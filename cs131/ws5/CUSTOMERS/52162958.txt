One (the one that takes up most of the book, or at least it seemed that way while I was reading it) is a soap-opera with a cast of like seven or eight twenty-or-thirty-something hip-but-struggling young people in modern London. They do poetry readings and open hat shops and predictive-software startups and have babies (well, one baby) and flashback to when they were all (or some) in school together, and get drunk and have fights and reconcilliations and stuff.<br /><br />I could have done with a bit less of that plot, but that's probably just because I'm a heartless geek. I mean, they're nice and well-drawn enough people, but do I really care if Karen and Tom get back together?<br /><br />The second story is about how the pigeons of London briefly get self-consciousness and language, and have a big civil war. This is a daring and brilliant hook, and the language of the pigeons is quirky and strange and almost always avoids being annoying.<br /><br />\\"Do you object if I take a ninety from the narrative thrust and detach myself like a sulky coochie from the flock (who's just dropped the squirmiest squirm into the reservoirs at Barnes, say, or lost the handsomest geez to some harlot rival with no charms but a coy coochie-coo)?\\"<br /><br />This part of the book (told in the first-pigeon by a bird named Ravenscourt) is fun, and has some interesting squirms in it about consciousness and contentment and conflict and all.<br /><br />The third story, that's supposed to tie together the other two, is about this guy Murray that the other cast members knew in school, who shows up again after ten years and has various effects on them. He has amazing magical powers of persuasion and charisma and generally making things happens. He has no last name, and he eats only chicken. He changes the shape of the relationships in the soap opera, generally for the better, and he is somehow related to the consciousness of the pigeons as well.<br /><br />It's a fun read (although a bit heavy on the soap opera), but ultimately the third story doesn't really succeed in tying together the other two. Murray's magical powers of personality feel like a continuous ex machina; in any situation he does or causes whatever the author needs done or caused.<br /><br />And we never really do get an explantion of the pigeon consciousness (unless I was just too dense to get it), aside from the fact that Murray and his mysterious history are somehow involved. We do get a revelation of one vital fact about what happened to him ten years ago, but we don't find out why he has no last name, why he only eats chicken, why he's intent on robbing a bank, why his personality is so stunningly impactful, or why a castoff bit of his lunch caused (or didn't cause) the pigeon thing.<br /><br />So. Fun read, various flaws, not amazing or life-changing but probably worth the time spent reading. And at least it's different...ousness of the pigeons as well.  <br /> <br />It's a fun read (although a bit heavy on the soap opera), but ultimately the third story doesn't really succeed in tying together the other two.

Books	2	6	7	N	N	One neat idea wrapped in an uninteresting novel	Benford's Cosm has exactly one thing going for it: it's the first (as far as I know) fictional treatment of the idea, from speculative cosmology, that universes might &quot;reproduce&quot;, by budding off little &quot;daughter&quot; universes. People have (inevitably) taken off from there, to the idea that universes might &quot;evolve&quot; over time, be subject to some analog of natural selection, and so on, and that this might even help explain why this universe has properties that enabled it to give rise to us. I think this idea is wrong and/or incoherent in various ways, but it's still interesting, and might eventually lead to something firmer.<br />Unfortunately, this idea has a role in only a tiny fraction of Cosm, and the rest of the book has nothing to recommend it, and quite alot to make me wince.<br />Much of the book is about the personal life of the protagonist, a black female physicist and professor. This would be good reading if it were unusually well-written, or gave interesting insights into what it might be like to be that person, or described an unusually interesting life, or if it were written by someone in a similar position who had real-life experiences to relate to. But the prose is pedestrian, there are no particular insights, the character's life isn't very interesting outside of the immediate plot, and Benford is not a black female physicist. The conflicts in the book are superficial, the emotions are simple, and the love story is completely straightforward.<br />Benford is a professor of physics. But the parts of the book that might have given interesting insights into that life have been contorted in unconvincing ways by the demands of the plot. The protagonist is an untenured junior professor; but when she discovers an object with the obvious potential to revolutionize the entire field from particle physics to cosmology, her University is content to leave her in charge of it (because that's necessary to Benford's plot).<br />In real life, she would certainly have been given a junior courtesy position in the institute that would have been set up to study the object, headed by the most prestigious members of the department and the relevant government agencies. In the book, she and one post-doc are left with sole acccess to it, and she is able (for instance) to forbid important alumni (but not, not quite, the President of the U.S.) from being allowed to see it. The only theoretician she allows near it is one that she randomly encounters (and eventually falls for) at another University.<br />Now maybe my idea of how university physics departments work is just completely wrong, and Benford's is right. That seems utterly unlikely, though, and Benford does nothing to convince me of it.<br />Anyway, I could rail on for some time, but it's not really worth it. This book might have made a decent short story, but as a novel it's unremarkable, and not a really good use of time.she would certainly have been given a junior courtesy position in the institute that would have been set up to study the object, headed by the most prestigious members of the department and the relevant government agencies.

The setting and dialog are<br />convincing, and the emotions will stay with you.  Which<br />is perhaps the problem!<br />There is no redemption here.  The mood and events are<br />dark, the deaths pointless.  There is no brain-teasing<br />mystery, no real lesson about human nature beyond that<br />it can be ugly and destructive.  I don't normally wonder<br />about the point of books, but I have to admit that after<br />this one I did.  What was the point of all that?  Did I<br />need to be reminded that life can be painful?  Maybe<br />I did.  In retrospect I think it was worth the time<br />to read, but I can't say I _enjoyed_ it.<br />There are a very few technical flaws (the drug-dealer<br />side-plot seemed entirely unnecessary, and the sudden<br />solving of the \\"mystery\\" at the end was abrupt and not<br />entirely convincing), but my complaint about this book<br />is not with the execution, but rather with the nature of<br />the project.  A single beam of light would, I think, have<br />made this a more worthwhile work.	2003-02-25
US	52162958	R1HDEVTHJ0U2XY	0441809332	803585157	Time Pressure	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Good SF, good character twists	The best thing about this book for me is how it twists around. For the first half you see everything strictly from the narrator's point of view, and everything he says seems rational and correct. Then you start to have a few doubts, and just as it occurs to you that in fact he's sort of a jerk, the plot twists, you (both) find out that some things weren't at all what they seemed (and others were exactly), and when the dust settles both you and the narrator are seeing things very differently.<br />As SF, this is good and solid (if slightly oldfashioned, being from the 80s), with nice treatments of telepathy, time travel, and the future of humanity. In general setting, I liked the whole Canadian Hippie Commune treatment; it's done convincingly, not as the easy stereotype it could have been.<br />I've seen a couple of people complain about the erotic parts of the book, and I have to admit I don't really understand it; the love scenes aren't particularly pornographic, and they *are* important to the plot. And why would anyone dislike love scenes anyway? But maybe that's just me. *8)	2003-01-18
US	52162958	R1MSUVZ1H3HTDC	074341196X	733935310	Inversions	Books	5	5	7	N	Y	Banks is a freaking genius	And I never say stuff like that.<br />This is a very good book in lots of ways that other people have already pointed out.  One that particularly strikes me, though, is that some lucky people can read it twice and get two different novels out of it.  If you haven't read anything in Banks' &quot;Culture&quot; series, read this *first*.  It'll be enjoyable and mysterious and engrossing, and satisfying despite the unresolve conundra.<br />Then read the other &quot;Culture&quot; books.  You'll think &quot;oh, is *that* what was going on in 'Inversions'!&quot; and you'll be able to go back and read it again for another entirely good time.<br />This is one of those all too rare books that tantalize the reader with a deep and interesting mystery, and then when the mystery is finally revealed (in this case, by reading a different book entirely), the solution to the mystery is fully as rich and interesting as the mystery itself was.<br />Read it at once.	2001-11-05

Most of this book is great fun; hip and funny, and also a Work of Ideas, all about art and love and design and integrity and stuff.  Then (somewhere around the Frat Party scene) Kidd seems to have realized it was about time for the ending, and reached for the explosives.<br />The last two chapters seem to be mostly a hallucinatory dream induced by lack of sleep (the protagonist's, that is, although I could believe it of Kidd also).  Which is very nice and modern and all, but I'd rather know what *happened*.  Unless I'm overly dense, Kidd is violating his own quite plausible design rule: when designing an object of whatever kind, it's more important that it accomplish the purpose than that it look clever.<br />But anyway!  It's a good book, and do read it.  It won't take all that long; it's a pretty wild and energetic ride.  And maybe the ending that was silly and opaque to me will be lucid and relevatory to you.  You Never Know.	2001-11-05

The &quot;Paradox&quot; artifact pays essentially no role in the story.)<br />The hard thing about the &quot;mysterious alien artifacts&quot; theme is that if you've done the setup well the reader is wildly curious about the aliens and what astounding purposes their artifacts must have had, and doing a good ending is extremely challenging.  It's hard to make the actual explanation as mind-bending and transcendant as the reader wants it, needs it, to be.  The novels in &quot;Convergent Series&quot; are, unfortunately, an example of how the actual explanation of the enigma can disappoint.<br />Without giving the ending away entirely, it turns out that the aliens are basically pretty dumb.  Their entire civilization was traumatized by one of those pseudo-profound questions that first year Philosophy students dissect endlessly in the pub, but that in fact evaporate under serious consideration.  Their approach to working on the problem is utterly silly and implausible, and serves mainly as a plot device to get the characters to where they need to be for the next scene.<br />The book is certainly fodder for airplane reading if you have nothing else to hand.  But there are lots better things out there...	2001-08-23

But &quot;Decision&quot; isn't Drury at his best.<br />The novel has its good points. The characters are well-drawn and mostly convincing, and both the general topic (the Supreme Court) and two of the specific questions (the objectivity of the Court, and media coverage of executions) are interesting and extremely timely.  The book was written in the early '80s; it says something that the issues are hot in the '00s. It's not fast-moving, but Drury is a thought guy, not an action guy, and he's not fast-moving even as his best.<br />The book's weaknesses overwhelm the good points. The writing is ponderous and self-absorbed, with a tendency to drift off into endless paragraphs full of ellipses. Reality is sometimes warped distractingly by the author's antileft leanings. In Drury's world, the only people who contribute to an organization against the death penalty are Hollywood elitists and &quot;such overseas sources as Libya, South Yemen, Angola&quot;. The common folks are unanimously in favor of the government throwing its weight around; vigilantes lynch only criminals, and vigilante justice is bad only because it violates theoretical principles of law. (In real life, of course, vigilantes are bad mostly because they lynch innocent people.)<br />And (bizarrely) Drury doesn't seem to have done his legal homework. He gets the meaning and function of _Miranda_ pretty much entirely wrong, and I think he seriously overestimates how often the Supreme Court takes up murder cases. The legal case at the center of the plot, which supposedly pits the Law against &quot;common sense&quot;, fails to convince me; it seems driven by plot requirements rather than legal or political reality. And surely any Supreme Court Justice would instantly and automatically remove himself from any case in which his own daughter was a victim?<br />You might want to read this if you know you like Drury and you want to see him thinking about the Supreme Court. But if you haven't read any Drury yet, don't start with this one!this if you know you like Drury and you want to see him thinking about the Supreme Court.

Fowles has written much better books; I would recommend this one only to people who already like reading him, and want to read even his weaker works. The book has some good moments, and one memorable setting, but that's not enough to sustain a 700 page novel. At half the length, it would have been a very impressive first novel, but...<br />The basic premise is attractive: while conspiracies and webs of deceit are usually malicious, conspiracies _against_ someone, this book points out that (especially if you're a self-absorbed young man) it can be pretty cool to be the focus of a conspiracy of rich intelligent people, especially if one (or two or three) of them are beautiful and sexually uninhibited women.<br />But that's about it; the premise is there, the lovely Greek island is there, but they just sit there. We have 400 or so pages of slow setup, a couple hundred pages of slightly quicker development and mystery, and then a final hundred pages of dull thud as we find that after undergoing a novel's worth of life-changing experiences the protagonist hasn't changed perceptibly, and is still the basically uninteresting jerk he started out as.<br />The motivations of the conspirators are never really explained.  Or rather the explanation is so implausible that it doesn't count; these people would not have gone to all that trouble for this guy.<br />So I got some nice images and new mental structures out of it, but I think my time would have been better spent elsewhere. It's hard to recommend a book when my first thought after finishing it was &quot;whew, finally! Now I can  go on and read something better.&quot;<br />The Latin passage at the end is from Pervigilium Veneris; Parnell's translation is &quot;Let those love now who never loved before; Let those who always loved, now love the more.&quot; And that's not really a spoiler IMHO; we still don't know what happened...  *8)	2001-04-19
US	52162958	R2P85DRNJFU1EJ	0451457366	887615419	The Engines of Dawn	Books	2	13	16	N	Y	Weak	The basic premise of this novel is promising, and could form the core of a well-crafted and absorbing book.  Unfortunately, &quot;The Engines of Dawn&quot; is not that book.<br />The writing is often awkward and cliche-ridden (&quot;He sported a black mustache of military smartness, and his snappy gray tunic had nary a crease&quot;), and the characters are largely cardboard cut-outs, their actions and emotions changing from moment to moment according to the demands of the plot rather than any plausible inner motivation.<br />The editors seem to have skipped the continuity-checking  phase, and problems abound.  In the book's first pages we are told that the characters' clothing is a smart nanotech construct that can be made to flow on and off of their bodies at will.  But that fact is never mentioned again, and by the end of the book we have someone in &quot;a torn tunic&quot;.  While orbiting a planet, someone mentions casually that because of the topography there are probably &quot;surface winds in excess of two hundred miles an hour&quot;; but when they go down to the surface they take no precautions against such winds, there are in fact no such winds, and no one comments on the fact.  On one page we are told that there are only four known Earthlike planets; later we are told that a particular kind of ivy is found on &quot;a number of worlds&quot;.  And so on.  Much of the technology is quite implausible also.<br />More seriously, the books' basic plot device is equally shaky:  a Good Alien has an important secret that the humans must know,  so he concocts an elaborate, dangerous, and utterly implausible  plot to strand their ship in space in hopes that they will take refuge on and explore a word that contains vague hints about the  truth (hints that, as far as the alien could have known, were utterly unlikely to actually reveal the truth to the humans). Rather than, say, writing the secret down and slipping it under someone's door.<br />Which isn't to say that it's a totally awful book.  The awkward writing was only irritating, and I was interested  enough in what the big secret was that I stayed up late last night to finish it.  But there are lots and lots of better books out there...it's a totally awful book.

Also a good long introduction by A. Grove Day which should (like all too many &quot;introductions&quot;) only be read *after* reading the stories.<br />Most of the people in these stories are, of course, either victims or perpetrators (or both) of one of those long painful Western exploitations of a less civilized (&quot;less civilized&quot;) part of the world.  London knows that that's what's going on, and he writes with sympathy for all concerned, and without the more self-conscious bemoaning that would be expected of a XXIst century writer. To the modern reader, then, he can sometimes seem cold-blooded, but seldom disturbingly so.<br />The prose is fine and spare most of the time, and never gets in the way of the tale. The places and the tales are memorable. There is not a great variety of character and setting; the eight stories together could almost be a single novel. His voyage on the Snark (which inspired these stories) clearly left him with a strong and single impression of this place and these people, and he conveys that impression skillfully along to us.<br />Definitely worth reading.	2000-10-17

In some previous books, he's done a good job of showing us those worlds through the eyes of  someone not directly in the center of the action, someone who is (like us)  at least partly tangential.  (Contrast this with Vernor Vinge, say, whose  hero often *is* the center of the action [overgeneralization mode  off].)<br />In &quot;Distraction&quot;, Sterling carries this a step too far.  While the future world is interesting and full of wild and fascinating  characters and phenomena, virtually all the cool stuff happens far  off-camera, and we're sentenced to following around a fast-talking but  basically rather clueless and shallow political operative, Oscar  Valparaiso, as he wanders in and out of various artificial situations for  no particular reason.<br />The frustrations caused by this are numerous.  One  glaring example: Oscar's main love interest is Greta, a top cognition  scientist working in (and sometimes running) a cool government research  center inside a big glass dome.  At one point in the book, we discover that  a neat strange cool cognitive technology has been developed.  Sounds like  it should all fit together? No, as it turns out the technology was  developed sometime before the book started, in some other state, by  scientists who used to work at Greta's lab but quit.<br />The only thing the  tech has to do with Oscar and Greta is that it's used on them, as passive  victims, near the end of the book, when Sterling seems to be grasping for  enough new plot to fill out the page count.  Tsk! Greta's character, and  the title of the book, suggest that Sterling may have started out with some  tighter idea about the technology and function of human attention and  distraction; but if so the idea got abandoned somewhere along the  way.<br />I'd love to read a book set in this world, from the viewpoint of one  of the proles who travel the country in gangs living off harvested roadside  weeds, or one of the people trying to put out Wyoming (which is on fire),  or someone in Holland (with which the US is conducting a Cold War).  Stuck  with Oscar Valparaiso, I could only writhe in frustration.<br />Sterling fans  will want to read this; I don't particularly recommend it to anyone else.  Read &quot;Schismatrix&quot;, read &quot;Crystal Express&quot;, read  &quot;Islands in the Net&quot;, read &quot;The Artificial Kid&quot;.

It's a good book, not ponderous but sometimes deep, easily worth  the time.<br />Also as always, I have the feeling that Lewis has introduced  some quiet saboteur memes into my brain, and that some day they'll all join  together and I'll wake up and find myself a Christian.

Many reviewers have noted the dramatic irony: a  reader who has read &quot;Fire Upon the Deep&quot; knows why the dreams  failed and progress always seems to stagnate, but the characters in the  book (and readers who haven't read &quot;Fire&quot;) can only  wonder.<br />Most of the characters in the book are human. Even the non-human  aliens, the Spiders, are awfully human in culture and psychology if not in  body-shape; this makes it easier to have them sympathetic characters, but  misses the chance to illuminate human nature by showing something else (in  this respect &quot;Deepness&quot; reminds me of Robert Forward's annoying  &quot;Camelot 30K&quot;, in which the alien society is essentially medieval  England).<br />I have one structural gripe with &quot;Deepness&quot;:  something Very Important happens at around page 350, and continues  happening through most of the rest of the book, but we don't find out about  it until page 700 or so, where it provides a rather jarring deus ex machina  for Our Heros. I'll admit it was a fun surprise, but I'm not sure Vinge was  quite justified in keeping it from us all that time.<br />But anyway, the  aliens, the human trader culture (the Queng Ho, happy capitalists who  travel from star to star doing whatever business there is to do) and the  Bad Guy culture (the Emergents, smiling fascists with one Big Secret) are  interesting in themselves, and they clash in insightul and convincing ways,  and there is enough cool scientific and cultural tech to keep any geek  happy. It's a very good book (including various fun things I haven't  mentioned), and it's part of the development of a fascinating future  history.<br />(A direct sequel seems likely, as Queng Ho founder Pham Nuwen  has to get himself frozen so he can show up millennia later in &quot;Fire  Upon the Deep&quot;, and the smartest Spider vanishes mysteriously and is  (har har) presumed dead.)br />(A direct sequel seems likely, as Queng Ho founder Pham Nuwen  has to get himself frozen so he can show up millennia later in &quot;Fire  Upon the Deep&quot;, and the smartest Spider vanishes mysteriously and is  (har har) presumed dead.)	2000-06-14

The author, a thoroughly educated sometime-writer, works as a cleaner, cleaning people's houses.  She tells us something of what  that's like, and she also pokes into other corners of the cleaning world,  talking to someone who cleans up after murders, talking to folks who get  paid extra to clean in the nude, and spending a week in a spiritual  community in Japan that finds sustenance in service, including  cleaning.<br />The book is a somewhat uneven read; now and then we get close  to an insight into the human condition, or a lovely bit of prose.  More  often, though, the text reminds me of Paul Theroux or William Least Heat  Moon at their grumpiest: going to interesting places and having a lousy  time, meeting interesting people and disliking them.  The author of  &quot;Other People's Dirt&quot; doesn't really seem to like anybody very  much, and her dislike keeps her at a distance that prevents most real  insight.  On the other hand, she doesn't give in to the dislike enough to  really get nasty; while she constantly claims to know lots of little  intimate secrets about her clients, and apparently shares them with fellow  cleaners, she doesn't share many with us, so we don't even get that naughty  illicit fun.<br />Anyway, the book is worth the read.  You may get a laugh, or  an interesting wince, or learn something about cleaners and their clients.  But don't expect it to change your life.	2000-03-29

McCloud has a deep understanding of art and society and people, and a completely lucid  presentation.<br />There are neat and useful new ways of thinking about comics  here (his comparisons of American and Japanese comics, his theories of  panel transitions and why comic characters are sometimes drawn more simply  than the backgrounds, his comments on the psychological impact of color),  and for that matter ways of thinking about art in general, and design in  general.  And he makes masterly use of the comic medium itself to present  the material in a way that never drags or confuses.<br />I hope someone  programs the Orbital Mind Control Lasers so that McCloud extends this book  into a whole series on the theory and practice of comics, and another on  general visual design.  The world needs it!	2000-03-03

As long as that someone is relatively enlightened about the occasional explicit or disturbing image!<br />The photographs are well chosen and span a very wide range, from interesting early pornography (yes, there  was hard-core even in 1855!), to romantic and abstract pictures that  wouldn't shock even the dullest U.S. Senator, to Ann Mandelbaum's bizarrely  erotic whatsits. Many of them are true gems, images that catch and hold the  viewer in that wordless somewhere evoked by the best photographic art.<br />The arrangement into eight large sections gives a certain amount of  structure to the book, and allows the text to cover a subset of the images  at a time, but don't look for any very scholarly or systematic division.  The format is too small for a coffee-table book, and the text is too  general and chatty to constitute a serious critical study; but these are  nits.  The book is well worth buying, or giving, to anyone that takes in  joy through the eyes.	2000-01-27
US	52162958	R33CNDFMIWLYEP	0679770798	51425776	Jaguars Ripped My Flesh	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Well, three-and-a-half	Cahill is fun to read; not as funny as Dave Barry, and not as (what?) thoughtful or thought-provoking as John McPhee, but fun.  Cahill is (or does a good job of convincing us he is!) a Regular Guy in the Dave Barry  sense, but he gets paid to go to interesting places and do exciting things.  He tells us what that's like in a friendly journalistic style laced with  well-done humor.<br />One warning: the sequencing of the essays leaves  something to be desired.  In particular, the last four or five pieces are  all rather dark and dismal contemplations of tragedy and mortality, with  almost no humor.  You might want to read them first, or sometime in the  middle, rather than come away from the book on such a depressing note.	2000-01-06
US	52162958	R3IEC8MC2Z6OI2	0671526723	577832154	Audrey Hepburn's Neck	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Highly Recommended!	This is a very good book.  The prose is fine, deeply sensuous, sometimes luminous.<br />&lt;&lt; On Shiretoko Peninsula, laundry is carelessly left out overnight, clean sheets snapping in the dark wind.  Here in Tokyo's gay bar  district, though, neon signs are stacked one on top of another four stories  high, and their bright colors bleed together in the rain like watercolors.  Toshi and Paul walk past Marine Club, Kings of College, 69, Zip, Morning  Tissue, Idol Host Snack Bar.  Rain swirls around them like vapor.  An  umbrella, even if they had one, would offer no protection. &gt;&gt;<br />The  characters are well-drawn, the settings feel real, the problems are  authentic and involving. The length is perfect, and the scenes are  well-chosen. While the writing is suffused with emotion, there is no hint  of mawkishness.  Endings are always hard; the resolution here is if  anything too neat, too hopeful, too complete.  But we all need an ending  like that once in awhile, to remind us that sometimes people really do get  their lives together and end up happy.<br />Nominally the book is about Japan,  about a young Japanese man growing up, his relationship to foreignness and  foreigners, to his past and his country's past.  And it does that well. But  I'm also reminded of Barthes's &quot;Empire of Signs&quot;: using Japan to  stand for the exotic, to take the reader out of the familiar, in order to  talk about the wider universe.  So part of the reason this book is so good,  and that it doesn't matter that it's written by an Alan Brown rather than a  Toshiyuki Okamoto, is that as well as telling us &quot;this is what  foreigners can be like, if you're Japanese&quot;, it also tells us  &quot;this is what the world can be like, if you're human&quot;.	1999-12-13

Roughly eight different kinds of odd things, only very loosely  held together by the theme of  &quot;Apocalypse&quot;.<br />&quot;Apocalypse&quot; is an ambiguous word, and  the selection of odd beliefs in &quot;Apocalypse Pretty Soon&quot; plays on  that ambiguity.  There's no obvious tie between the folks who believe that  Aliens will soon descend to Earth and give us enlightenment and cool  technology, the supplement-megadose folks who believe that with the right  pills they can live a real long time, and the Out of Body Experience folks  who believe in astral travel.  Heard gives us a few insights into (or  guesses about) their characters that suggest some reasons people might  believe these odd things, but he draws no general lessons and comes to no  general conclusion.<br />It's an easy and enjoyable read, about some  interesting people.  It doesn't go beyond the anecdotes, and for that  reason left me somewhat unsatisfied, but it's by no means a bad book.	1999-12-08

He comes across as a relentlessly enlightened person,  beneficent toward all, earnest to the point of humorlessness.<br />The book  tells the story of the past and present of the Web, and Berners-Lee's ideas  about the future, at a very high level.  It's not a Techie's History of the  Web; there are a few annoying technical gaffes, and not much about the bits  and bytes.  I was surprised to read some non-technical reviewers opine that  it was *too* technical.  No pleasing everyone, I guess!<br />I'm not convinced  by Berners-Lee's idea that, if only we hook everything together well  enough, we will then be able to make computers that understand, that  reason, that figure stuff out for us.  I think the hooking-together is the  easy part, and we'll still be far from real understanding.  On the other  hand, maybe I would have been a skeptic back in 1989, too, when he was  telling people about this crazy thing called the World Wide Web...  *8)	1999-11-24

Connie Willis is a good writer, good at telling funny and/or moving stories about us people and our problems and triumphs.  Hard-SF fans should definitely look elsewhere; all the science and sociology and  future-speculation in these stories is completely in the service of the  human emotions and predicaments she wants to explore.  This is SF really  only by accident.<br />I would have enjoyed the book more if the stories had  been shorter and tighter, and perhaps if I hadn't read them all at once.  At least three of them are rather similar &quot;screwball comedies&quot;,  and those three stories are 27, 60, and 98 (! ) pages long.<br />I think she  could have done what she wanted to do in half, or even a third, of the  length, without hurting the qualities of the stories.  But that may just be  because I'm a busy Daddy without spare hours to spend savoring every  page.<br />I'm not going to rush out and buy all the rest of her books, but I  probably will read more eventually.	1999-11-10

My initial impression is that I could have written virtually all of it myself.<br />The book consists of a large number of 1/2 or  3/4 page essays, superficially describing some aspect of design (color,  line, type, shape-with-type, etc), and urging the reader (basically) to try  lots of things and see what looks the best.  In between the essays are  small illustrations of design drafts or finished products, with short and  generally unenlightening captions.  I expected more!<br />There are a few bits  of concrete advice in the book, but many are so vague as to be unhelpful  (&quot;consider the use of color in your design&quot;), and some are simply  wrong.  For instance, it's hard to credit the statement &quot;it is  unlikely that a light, classic serif type will mix with a heavy, sans serif  face&quot;, when it's printed in a light oldstyle serif face, under a  heading that's in (you guessed it!) a heavy sans.  On another page, some  advice about the cost of color choices seems to show a misunderstanding of  how the four-color printing process works.  On at least two occasions, the  text refers to an illustration &quot;on this page&quot;, when no  illustration matching the text description actually appears anywhere in the  book.<br />The diction is odd and stilted, as though it were imprefectly  translated from the Korean, or perhaps the Icelandic.  Can You Parse This:  &quot;The emphasis in describing this product range is the link between  acceptable branding style described by choice of type and the various  options in positioning the visual content.&quot;  Huh?<br />Another oddity:  the book mentions computers exactly once, in a confused sentence about  phototypesetting.  Given that the majority of design projects these days  use the computer in at least one stage of design (and often many more),  this seems unaccountable.<br />Perhaps there are things in this book that  would be helpful to someone with a cognitive style very different from  mine, but I found it disappointing, and the few possibly-valid pieces of  advice and interesting illustrations not worth the price or the time.m  mine, but I found it disappointing, and the few possibly-valid pieces of  advice and interesting illustrations not worth the price or the time.	1999-10-28

When he writes &quot;Coney dropped like a smartbomb from a  scramjet&quot;, he may be accurately forecasting the way technological  words seep into common speech, but I suspect he's just having fun.  If that  sort of thing doesn't bother you, and you don't mind figuring out a heavy  dose of new vocabulary on the fly (I like it, myself; I figured out most  things, including &quot;whychromes&quot;, but although I got the meaning of  &quot;reedpair&quot; quickly enough I'm still in the dark on the etymology  of it), you'll probably enjoy this book.<br />I did.	1999-10-28

The first few stories were so bad that I found myself writing derisive comments in the margins (something I don't generally do).  Some of the later stories managed to achieve mediocrity,  unremarkableness.  But there are no interesting insights into the legal  system here, no engrossing courtroom drama, no judicial puzzlers, no  treatments of the important legal issues of our time.<br />The most  blameworthy of the stories is a ham-handed political tract, interspersed  with awful *poetry* for heaven's sake.  You can decide for yourself whether  or not you want to be caught dead with a book that contains this:<br />  The  President had gotten to Jersey Joe.<br />  Harvey'd been betrayed; a very  low blow.<br />  He had many years to think about ethics.<br />  The  age-old question: was it social or genetics?<br />Gag...	1999-10-22
