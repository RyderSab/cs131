Gripping story, great characters, realistic depictions of navy life.  Then came the attempt at courtroom drama, which to me, was a total waste of time.  My advice is to read the book for the wonderful story, and then skip straigh to the Epilogue to find out how the court martial was resolved.

While I enjoyed the story, the author gets really long-winded at times, and sometimes talks for pages and pages about things that really have nothing to do with the story. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this storyline enough that I have started \\"Kilo Class\\", the second story in the series.  I'm only 50 pages in, and it's great so far.  There hasn't been the same droning on and on about things that don't concern the story(yet).  <br /> <br />This book is worth reading, but just skip ahead 10 pages when the author starts to wander. <br /> <br />	2004-09-27

First, let me say this is a great first effort.  Wonderful plot line, well-developed characters, and it all takes place in an unexpected and new environment: the FL Everglades.  Definitely worthwhile reading!<br />Now my complaint:<br />Early on in the story, our author brings forth his metaphor for deep thought, GRINDING.  It has to do with problems being like sharp-edged stones in the mind that need to be smoothed down.  A great metaphor...a few times.  After the 5 or 600th reference, GRINDING begins to GRIND on the reader.<br />So keep the great plot lines and characters coming. Just not so much grinding please.	2004-06-28

While he makes some quite rudimentary plotting mistakes in his early work, this one is as close to perfect as he's gotten.<br />The great thing about the series is that you don't really have to read them in order,  Each one is it's own little time capsule, not relying on the others for plot or character definition.<br />So if you are new to Reacher, this is as good a place as any to start.<br />Pick it up...you won't be disappointed.	2004-05-02

It starts out great, then just totally dies for me in the middle, then a decent finish.<br />He's also picked up this annoying habit of repeating things when he's trying to emphasize a point. He repeats things...repeats them.  I don't remember him doing that is the other two, both of which I gave 5 stars to.  So if the author is reading this, no need to repeat what you think is important.  We get it.<br />So if you like Lashner, which I do, it's worth reading.  But when it starts to drag in the middle, plod on through...the ending is better.	2004-05-02

It's a good solid story, albeit a little slow and plodding at times.  The only thing I really disliked about the book was Merci's kid, Tim.  He's 3, and she makes a point very early on to say that Tim likes to be contrary.  She says, &quot;the sky is blue&quot;, and Tim says &quot;the sky is not blue&quot;.  This is cute the first 3 or 4 times, but it happens about 150 times in the book.  <br />Sorry...I like kids, but little Timmy needs a to go to him room and stay there.  Other than that, a solid mystery with good character development.  Let's just leave Tim at home on the next one, OK?	2004-03-01

I was really looking forward to this one, but it disappointed me.<br />In the first book, Perry was straightforward and to the point. In Sleeping Dogs, it's almost as if Perry was told by someone that you have to explain every detail of every character. This includes people who are just about to be killed.  So with every new character he brings in, we get a few pages of history  on the person, only to have them get killed a second later, or leave the plot line never to  be heard from again.<br />The ending was a real disappointment.  The method Perry uses to allow The Butcher's Boy to get away is very poor.  I really felt cheated.<br />So my advice is read the first one, and skip the second.	2004-01-07

This is the fourth of the Banks series that I have read, and it is my favorite so far.<br />A skeleton is found under the floor in a house at the bottom of a flooded reservoir that has dried out in a drought.<br />Two stories then begin.  One, modern day, in which Banks tries to piece together what happend to this woman more than 50 years ago.  The second story take place in the past and tells the story of the dead woman as it really happened.  All the while, the reader gets to watch Banks try and reconstruct the killing, while also reading the actual story as it happens leading up to the killing.<br />The other nice thing about the Banks series is that it gives us &quot;Yanks&quot; a slight flavor of what it's like to live in the UK.  This is also very refreshing.<br />Buying this book is money well spent.  Give it to a friend when you're done.  They'll thank you for it.	2003-11-29

He writes very well, and gives just enough character development to keep you interested without going overboard.

Having read all 3 of Hamilton's previous novels, I was anxious to see what he had in store for us this time around.  I have to say that I was disappointed.  The story starts out with us learning that Alex McKnight was having a mid-life crisis.  By the time I was halfway through it, I was wondering if Steve Hamilton might not be having one too.<br />The story just didn't draw me in the way the others did.  It seemed rushed, and the characters were not nearly as well developed as in his previous works.  While the ending was a kind of a surprise,  I was still glad this story was over.<br />If you're looking for a good read, check out Hamilton's first 3 novels...all are fantastic.  If you've already read them, and enjoyed them as much as I did, then I'd suggest you save yourself [the money] on this one and wait for the paperback.	2002-05-12

I have to admit that when I heard that this one was about vampires, I almost decided not to buy it. What a mistake that would have been!  Harstad comes through again with a story that is captivating, and filled with twists and turns.  He has a unique way of drawing you in, and keeping you guessing.<br />Probably my favorite part of the book, and the way he writes, is that he will occasionally drop just enough of a hint to keep you wondering about something for 40 or 50 pages, and then give you the answer. He does this in Code 61 with information about the house that the story takes place in.  What's on the locked 3rd floor?  Why should they drive for 4 hours to get a copy of the blueprints of the house?  Both are questions you'll be asking as you read the book, and you won't be disappointed when he finally delivers the answers.<br />I highly recommend this, and all of the Harstad novels.  He was a cop for 20+ years, and his experience comes out in his writing.  You won't be disappointed!	2002-05-06

This is the second story about Luke Garrison, the former DA from Santa Barbara, who is a again pulled from his tiny law practice to handle a huge case that the whole country is watching.<br />The case centers around a major  drug kingpin who is killed while in the custody of the DEA after an  attempted drug bust went bad.<br />I think Freedman makes a critical mistake  in this book, in that the entire story revolves around a very bad guy who  it's really hard to care about.  If you can't care about the central cause  for the story, then it's also hard to care about who killed him and  why.<br />It was  an OK read.  The characters, as always, are very well  developed.  There are also some sub plots that creep in and out of the  story that are good.  There are just too many dead spots in between the  parts that interested me.<br />If you like Freedman, it's worthy of reading.  If you've never read Freedman, check out &quot;The Disappearance&quot;  first.  It's a much better book, and will give a feel for what he's really  capable of.	2000-04-17
