Rowling returns at the top of her game in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth and second-to-last book in the series.  The story has all the best parts of her previous books.  It takes place mainly at Hogwarts.  Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore and Snape are by far the main characters.  The book combines the wonders of learning magic with the troubles of a normal teenager. <br /> <br />As always, the book picks up in the summer after Book 5 ends.  We learn that the battle against Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters continues, but is not going well.  We learn that Professor Snape, Harry's nemesis is at least a double-agent and maybe a triple agent, working for both Voldemort and Dumbledore.  We learn that Harry's other nemesis, Draco Malfoy, is also no good. <br /> <br />With the stage set, Harry returns to Hogwarts to begin his advanced classes after doing very well on his exams in all the important classes the previous year.  Harry goes on memory trips with Dumbledore to learn of Lord Voldemort's past, which will help him defeat Voldemort in the future.  He, Ron, and Hermione all deal with increasing feelings of love, and Harry keeps his eyes on Snape and Malfoy. <br /> <br />And to top all this off, the ending is amazing.  Run out and buy it if you haven't already.	2005-07-28

First, like several of his other stories, the whole town surrounding the house is also haunted.  Second, the haunted house story is also intertwined with romance. <br /> <br />In the book, main character Michael Noonan's wife dies within the first two pages of the book.  Like many of King's characters, Noonan is a writer.  However, he experiences complete writer's block and loneliness after his wife's death.  Noonan starts having dreams of his country house, Sarah Laughs in Western Maine and eventually decides to go back to his beloved house even though the dreams are spooky and bespeak of danger. <br /> <br />As soon as he returns to his country house, Noonan realizes that the house is haunted.  There are sounds of crying, a presence of something else there, words being formed by the magnetic alphabet on the fridge and other matters.  Noonan also gets caught up in a custody battle between a rich man and his poor daughter-in-law/widow. <br /> <br />King tells a remarkably good haunted house tale even for a master of horror like him.  If you have ever felt a ghost in an old house, you will recognize the reactions his characters have.  King is also getting better as a writer of romance.  You can really feel for the female characters, both Noonan's dead wife and the woman in the custody battle.   <br /> <br />Sadly, King is no Scott Turow or John Grisham.  His views of the legal system and custody laws are bizarre.  The ways the lawyers act are just laughable.  But this is just a small annoyance.  The legal maneuvers do make up a large of the book, but they are really just a device to move the process along and give some suspense other than what the ghosts are up to. <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend this book.  If you want a haunted house story, you will immensely enjoy this book.	2005-06-08

Fans are so happy that he went back to writing this series.   <br /> <br />Wolves of the Calla takes place at the borderlands between Midworld, where we first met Roland the Gunslinger, and Endworld, where the Dark Tower lies, and where Roland's quest will take him.  We spend most of the book in these borderlands with sidetrips to New York and elsewhere in America. <br /> <br />We learn at the beginning of the book that the \\"wolves\\" are coming to a small town on that border and will take approximately half of the children away where they will be \\"roont,\\" losing their minds and wrecking their bodies.  The farmers and townsmen have endured this for generations because the wolves have exotic weapons and may be supernatural.  However, this time some of the townspeople are ready to stand up to the wolves. <br /> <br />Into this fight comes Roland and his ka-tet, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake of New York.  It becomes clear that they will have to take on this side-quest of saving the children of the town from the wolves, but they are outnumbered, and it is unclear how much help the townspeople will be. <br /> <br />Complicating matters is that something seems seriously wrong with Susannah, that a rose in New York that appears to have a connection to the Dark Tower is imperiled and other matters. <br /> <br />We also meet Father Callahan from 'Salem's Lot again.  And if you haven't read Salem's Lot but are reading the Dark Tower series, I would suggest reading it before turning to this book.  In some of King's best writing, we learn the tragic story of what happened to Father Callahan after he left that cursed town. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  King draws us back in to Roland's world with a vengeance.	2005-05-18

The story begins with Susannah/Mia having stolen away from her ka-tet and going through the unfound door to New York.  The rest of her ka-tet have to split up, half going to follow her and half going to Maine to help save the rose and to confront Stephen King, who is their chronicler (if not their creator).   <br /> <br />The ka-tet is split, and we alternate between the stories of (1) Eddie and Roland, (2) Jake, Father Callahan and Oy, and (3) Susannah/Mia.  In a twist of fate, Jake, Father Callahan and Oy are sent after Susannah/Mia despite the desire of Eddie, her husband, to assume that role.  Eddie and Roland go to Maine even though Father Callahan, who has lived in Maine, is the one who should go there.  The story is even-paced, and by-and-large well-written.  <br /> <br />However, if this weren't a necessary chapter in the Dark Tower series, I am not sure I much like the book.  First, unlike most of the other books in the series, this book mainly takes place in America.  It therefore loses some of the power and wonder of the rest of the Dark Tower series.   <br /> <br />Second, a large part of it focuses on Susannah.  Since the only interesting part of Susannah's character is one of her alternate personas in her split personality, Detta Holmes, she always surfaces to make Susannah interesting.  But King has used this as a crutch and Susannah's character is therefore not interesting. <br /> <br />Third, I think it was a mistake for Stephen King to write himself into the series.  I know that King says he didn't want to do this but was compelled by the story.  I know that it was difficult for King to write this series and that he felt scared by his severe car accident and felt that he had to finish.  Nevertheless, once it became clear to him that the story was leading towards including himself as a major category, I wish he would have put the book aside until he found a better way to go. <br /> <br />He has done this before in this series, and it has improved the series.  Alas he did not do so this time. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, nothing associated with the Dark Tower can be that bad.  Therefore, I recommend this book.	2005-05-18

Roland is so close to the tower, he can taste it.  The ka-tet is full of gloom since King has hinted over the year that not everybody will make it to the Tower.  There are fast-paced battles to be won, beam breakers to be dealt with.  There are monsters to vanquish, and, of course, there is a dark tower to visit. <br /> <br />I loved every minute of the book even if I wouldn't have written myself into the book if I were writing it and even if I wouldn't have written the same ending. <br /> <br />The best part is that several old and dear, but seemingly lost, friends return.  You all expected Ted from Hearts of Atlantis, but there are others equally beloved who appear in this book. <br /> <br />We keep learning little drips and drabs of the final stand of Roland's first ka-tet on Jerusalem Hill and how he and Cuthbert stood together until the last.  Hopefully, King will someday write this as a short story and we will finally read the tragic tale of the fall in Gilead in full. <br /> <br />If you've come this far, definitely read this book.  You will love it.	2005-05-18

Some things about the book are certainly dated, such as stereotypes about and the language used to refer African Americans, but others are timeless. <br /> <br />Penrod tries to spend his entire life having what he thinks is harmless fun with his friends and neighbors and learning about the amazing world in which he is living.  Unfortunately, everything he does gets him in trouble with the adults around him--teachers, parents, parents of neighbors.  And Penrod is always bewildered about the fact that he is in trouble, bewildered by the fact that he takes a beating at punishment, and equally bewildered by the times he escapes punishment. <br /> <br />Of course, as a preteen, he is also bewildered by girls.  He has a crush on a girl living in his neighborhood, but is completely unaware of how to get him to like her.  She refers to him as the worst boy in town, and demands that he never speak to her.  Interestingly she angers him even more by calling him a \\"little gentleman\\" than she does by ignoring him and calling him the worst boy in town.  Of course, all this leads to Penrod falling deeper in love. <br /> <br />You will certainly enjoy this gentle book about the life of a charming and smart boy.	2004-12-14

I read it a couple of months after reading The House of Mirth, and The Custom of the Country actually makes a great companion piece to it.   <br /> <br />Custom of the Country is hard to love.  We loathe the selfishness of its main character, Undine Spragg, who always gets her way even if it ruins her parents or husband.  We marvel at her self-centeredness and her lack of awareness of what she is doing to others.  And she doesn't even have the spirit that a similar character, Scarlett O'Hara, has--something that make us root for Scarlett despite her character. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the House of Mirth is easy to love.  Its protagonist, Lily Bart, cries out for our sympathy and love.  She realizes she is caught by unfair societal requirements and wants to break free of them.  She is unable to do so, and it causes tragedy.   <br /> <br />But both Undine and Lily are caught in the same web.  They both cannot be truly happy because they cannot see a way out of their upbringing.  The main difference is that Lily is aware of her problem and Undine is not.   <br /> <br />But we should have sympathy for Undine, and we should judge Lily more harshly.  Shouldn't Lily, being aware that making her way in society is not a way to happiness, figure a way to break through of society's rules?  Shouldn't we feel sorry for Undine who never figures out that social climbing will not make her truly happy? <br /> <br />It is Wharton's genius to show us the flip-sides of how American aristocratic society harmed its great society ladies in these two richly written, beautiful books.  Everyone who has read and loved The House of Mirth should read this book.	2004-12-14

The book is fun to read. It is perhaps not the best-written of the bunch, but it is the most traditional mystery novel. <br /> <br />Archaeologists Amelia Peabody and her former competitor Emerson are now happily wed although pining for a return to Egypt to continue with their career after several years in the English countryside raising their son Ramses and being bored. Their chance comes when another archaeologist, Lord Baskerville, dies while excavating an Egyptian tomb that is rumored to be both untouched by grave robbers and cursed. Lord Baskerville's will provides that, in the event of his death, the tomb excavation must continue. The widow Lady Baskerville asks Emerson to lead the excavation. Peabody and Emerson jump at the chance. <br /> <br />Emerson is only interested in excavating the tomb, but Peabody wants both to learn the secrets of the tomb and the secrets of Lord Baskerville's death, since she believes he was murdered.  <br /> <br />The book focuses on Peabody's investigation, the numerous attempts on Emerson's life that may or may not be related to the curse, and the wild eccentricities of all the people interested in the excavation. The actual excavation of the tomb takes a definite backseat to these other issues. <br /> <br />The murder mystery is definitely enough to provide for a good plot and enjoyable reading. Peters keeps everyone under suspicion. The mystery revealing is very enjoyable. I recommend this book.	2004-12-09

Unlike books like Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, which chronicle life in 1800s America, The Prince and the Pauper is set in England in the 1500s.  But The Prince and the Pauper is like those two other classics in one way--the story is a true boys' adventure story that captures amazingly accurately how kids would act if the story actually happened.<br /><br />The Prince and the Pauper tells the story of poor London child Tom Canty who always pretended that he was a prince.  One day, he goes to the palace and meets the crown prince Edward Tutor.  It turns out that the two look exactly alike.  On a whim, the two boys change clothes.  Of course, this leads to disaster.  Prince Edward is immediately cast out of the palace by a guard, and Tom Canty is mistaken for the prince.  Neither knows how to act, both are afraid, and the people around both think they are mad.<br /><br />As one might expect, Tom Canty gets on better than Edward.  He lives every child's fantasy of suddenly becoming rich and adored.  Edward has more trouble.  He cannot believe that people do not recognize him for the prince.  He has to rely on a kind stranger who takes him in despite his apparent madness.  However, he learns self-reliance and the meaning of true justice while living among his subjects.<br /><br />Both the prince and the pauper wind up better for the adventure that they had, and as in a good adventure book, both live happily once their difficulties have been resolved.	2004-12-07

Elizabeth Peters hit upon a magic formula like other mystery and adventure writers before her.  Peters' formula is to combine exotic North African locations, late-19th Century/early 20th Century settings, which we can all look at with a combination of superiority and nostalgia, truly eccentric characters, and small bits of archaeology and history for good measure.  It works every time. <br /> <br />In this book, Peabody and her husband Emerson are sent to the Sudan to find out what has happened to a long-disappeared archaeologist and his young bride.  The story evokes not only the books of H. Rider Haggard, as many reviewers have commented, but the saga of Henry Stanley searching for Doctor Livingstone (Stanley actually is discussed briefly in the book). <br /> <br />Peabody and Emerson's quest quickly runs into problems when all of their camels die in the desert far away from water.  They are rescued and led to a wonderful, if implausible, area in which the natives are descendants of ancient Egyptian/Sudanese royalty and continue to worship the ancient gods and live according to ancient traditions. <br /> <br />Peabody and Emerson's reaction to their archaeological finds as well as their work to solve the mystery of their predecessor's disappearance makes for a great read.	2004-12-07

I probably read my first Christie book 25 years ago. <br /> <br />But I had never heard of her first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, before spotting it in a library.  This book is certainly not her best.  But it is certainly worth reading.  Interestingly, despite introducing her famous detective Hercule Poirot to the reader, she treats him as a person who people should know if they know anything about detectives, as someone with whom we are all acquainted already. <br /> <br />The plot has all the hallmarks of Agatha's later works.  A person dies.  There are small assorted clues, but nothing like a smoking gun.  There are people who hate the victim, and people who love them, but Christie manages to draw suspicion upon both sets of characters alike without making the plot seem forced.  The intricate plan for the murder that eventually comes out is similarly within the realm of possibility. <br /> <br />The only real problem I had was that when Poirot revealed the final clue, it was something none of us could have guessed beforehand.  Still, this was a good first effort in a marvelous career for Agatha Christie.	2004-12-07

One daughter is embroiled with teenage concerns and tries her best to evade her father's authority and live a normal teen's life.  One daughter tries to follow every one of her father's rules and berates herself for failing to live up to her father's ideal.  One has retreated into muteness in order to build her own world outside of her family.  And the baby daughter acts as a baby daughter everywhere. <br /> <br />Of course, the family's various troubles are all magnified hundreds of times by the trip to the wilds of the Congo, something with which they have no capacity to deal because of their sheltered upbringing.  The mother narrates section breaks from the present day--hauntingly foreshadowing the troubles that will befall the country. <br /> <br />Needless to say, this brings on disaster.  Disaster is compounded as the Congo goes up in flames with independence and CIA and KGB intrigue.  The story takes a turn for the worse at this point as Kingsolver blames the U.S. for destroying the Congo without looking at the fact that the Soviet Union was also trying to use the newly-independent African states as pawns in the Cold War and would happily have destabilized a staunchly pro-Western government and that European colonialism in Africa, the arbitrary nation lines, and the sudden thrust of these colonies into independence and the modern world doomed many of them to failure no matter what. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the book is a must read.  The writing is beautiful.  The disasters that strike the Price family are dramatic and shocking.  The girls' attempts to rise up after the disasters are heartbreaking. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this book.	2004-10-05

Frank Herbert did not envision a great battle against robot overlords.   <br /> <br />He envisioned a deeply religious war against people relying over much on computers fought by ordinary people against human elites (that's why, in a galaxy of exotic names, he chose \\"Butler\\" as the name for the jihad leader).  Even if there were planets taken over by robots, the jihad the elder Herbert envisioned would never have allowed people to use robots to train swordmasters or to guide human ships as happens in this book. <br /> <br />Frank Herbert likely would have used such plot points differently.  There would be people secretly and illegally using computers believing that they could learn from their enemy and that the ends justify the means.  They would have been discovered by the Jihad, and whether they continued to use machines or were killed for doing so, the results would have been ambiguous. <br /> <br />The authors of this series don't have such a vision.  But the Machine Crusade was still enjoyable space opera with some hints of Frank Herbert's universe.  Knowing that we would never get the story the way Frank would have told it, it was still interesting to see the continued gelling of the various factions of the Dune world--Bene Gesserit, Tleilaxu, Guild, Fremen told on the background of an action-packed war against humans and machines, a story of political intrigue among humans, and the continued and humorous (partly unintentionally) story of the quirky robot Erasmus.  We never know from one moment to the next whether a character we enjoy will live or die. <br /> <br />Less interesting was the story of the swordmasters of Ginaz.  Since these two authors focused on Ginaz swordmasters in their \\"House\\" books in a way Frank Herbert never did, I guess they were more interested in telling of their audience.  The rest of us could have skipped the story. <br /> <br />Thisbook held my interest enough that I will buy the third one when it comes out in paperback, but not enough to rush out and by the hardcover.	2004-09-29

But rather than a straightforward narrative, she tells the story of her class, and later her book club, which reads great American and British literature and discusses the books both on their own merits and for their meaning in a country with an extremely repressive government. <br /> <br />The author's strongest asset is her beautiful writing style.  It is a pleasure to read the prose.  The book reads easily, yet the reader finds him/herself enjoying the language and the author's turn of phrase. <br /> <br />I was also riveted by the author's description of life in Iran.  It was amazing to read of the intellectuals' support of action against the tyrannical (in their minds) Shah and the rise of radical Islam.  The intellectuals were so sure that the revolution would never result in oppression of women or squashing of academic independence because Iran was too advanced.  Of course, they were sadly mistaken, and the radicals took over with a firm grip. <br /> <br />However, the book also paints the story of an unhappy populace, and a conflicted nation.  Even as the state was denouncing all things Western as decadent and evil, they were trying to woo the author to teach a Western literature course at the university.  And the people were definitely interested in regaining Iran's intellectualism.  The author's class and book club risked denouncement by radical students and police to take the class.  And they struggled with the choice between giving up on Iran and moving to the West or working on the inside. <br /> <br />I did find the literary criticism to be the weakest part of the book.  Nafisi never gives us any insight into Lolita.  She does spend a lot of time on another Nabakov book, Invitation to a Beheading, but she mainly recounts the plot and says how similarit is to life in Iran.  Her discussion of other books was quite repetitive. <br /> <br />But overall, this was a great book, and I strongly recommend it.	2004-09-28

And Here My Troubles Began	Books	5	7	10	N	N	A Format that Brings It All Home	The Holocaust has been portrayed in many different ways by the media.  Given the nature of the holocaust, it is perhaps unsurprising that so many artists have tried to interpret it in their own way.  I have read many books and seen many movies on the Holocaust.  But still, I resisted Maus when my younger brother was assigned to read it for a book report for class.  A comic book/graphic novel doing justice to the Holocaust?  Surely not.<br /><br />However, once I gave in and read it, it turned out to be one of the best done works about the Holocaust.  It's hard to tell if that is because of the format (Jews portrayed as mice, Germans as cats, other nationalities with their own animal) or because of the devastating and honest story told by the narrator of his parents' struggle to survive the Holocaust and the trauma that this struggle continues to cause to the family.<br /><br />The graphic novel format certainly allows the author to break traditional molds.  He can portray the family as mice, or at one point, as humans wearing mouse masks and show different aspects of the characters without long explanations or opaque symbolism.  But on the other hand, I'm not sure a traditional book would have been any less effective.<br /><br />At any rate, the author's choice to use a graphic novel certainly works well, and I encourage anyone who has the stomach to delve again into the horrors of the Holocaust to read this book.	2004-08-12
US	52050206	R2BIAIJXYAMNNT	067168390X	34918879	Lonesome Dove	Books	5	3	3	N	N	An American Epic	Previous reviewers have already stolen the line I wanted to use to start my review: &quot;it is the quickest 900 pages you'll ever read.&quot; So let me add another similar line: When I was ready for bed but not ready to put down the book, I would promise myself to stop when I got to the end of the chapter. But when I got there, my eye would wander onto the next chapter, and I would be hooked and have to start over with a promise to turn out the light at the end of the new chapter. <br />  <br /> Lonesome Dove tells the story of two former Texas Rangers, Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call who have settled down to start a cattle and horse selling outfit in south Texas near the Mexican border. Neither seems very happy with their new choice of professions. Call drives the hired men hard with chores while Augustus drinks the night away. They treat each other like a stereotypical older married couple. Exasperated with each other, not understanding each other, but old friends who can't live without each other. <br />  <br /> An ex-compadre of theirs comes to town with news that the Montana territory is about to become safe for cattle ranches after years of Indian wars. Call has dreams of becoming rich by driving a herd of cattle up to Montana as well as dreams of reliving his youth by finishing the taming of Montana as he did in Texas. Gus, the more philosophical and romantic one, goes along for the ride with vague hopes of meeting up with his old flame in Nebraska and getting her to marry him. <br />  <br /> What follows is a Western epic with heroes, villains, outlaws, cattle stampedes and dangerous river crossings, tests of manhood for boys learning to become cowboys, and of course, love and loss on the range. But like the best stories in any genre, Lonesome Dove uses the setting to paint a story about what is important in life, our struggles to understand ourselves and the people around us, and, of course, matters of the heart. <br />  <br /> I strongly recommend this book to anyone who isn't daunted by a 900 page book.	2004-08-03

I thoroughly enjoyed the setting of the book.  I thought Meltzer seamlessly wove in interesting background information about life in the nation's capital, work in the political spotlight, and legal issues.  Since I am a lawyer, political junkie and D.C. resident, I thought that others might not have had the same reaction, but a quick perusal of other reviews shows that most people enjoyed the book.<br />The plot, unfortunately, is a little less believable.  Meltzer tells the story of a young lawyer, Michael, in the White House Counsel's office who goes on a date with the President's daughter, Nora, who has a reputation for wildness, but may or may not have a sweet side begging to get out.  Michael and Nora see Michael's boss in a compromising position.  However, almost immediately, Michael and Nora are stopped by the D.C. police and have suspicion thrown on them.  <br />Michael has to cover for Nora, partly because she already has a bad reputation and partly because the FBI is out to get Nora and the entire First Family.  However, as the plot unfolds, it becomes clear that the FBI must be filled with some of the worst cops on the planet if they are unable to pin anything on Nora, the First Family, or close allies of the First Family.  And in this age of Matt Drudge and others, even if the FBI could not do the job, others would be able to do it for them.<br />Thus, although I found it easy to read and finish the book, the book left me feeling a bit cheated.  Still a fun read though.	2004-05-27

I figured if there was ever a time when I would have the patience for a Victorian book that has been dubbed a classic by everyone, this was the time.<br />I definitely needed the patience.  The book begins with the famous line everybody knows, even if they don't know the source:  &quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&quot;  Unfortunately the book quickly mires down after that.  It is not that little occurs; the book is actually full of action, side plots, etc.  But it is also overfull of Victorian-era florid prose.  The reader gets a full dose of adjectives, but those adjectives rarely add up to a vivid picture.<br />Also, Dickens is a product of his times and the age-old Anglo-French rivalry is in full evidence in this book.  The French people who have spent significant time in England are all good people.  The French people who remained in France are uniformly evil.  With one exception, the English people, be they drunkards, grave robbers or stuffy bankers are all noble at heart.<br />However, the ending truly saves the entire book and turns my review from a pan to a rave.  The ending is heartrending, beautiful, exciting, and bittersweet.  The vivid imagery of people on the way to the guillotine, making their escape, or waiting to watch others be executed makes the picture leap from the page and makes the reader rip to the next page as one page comes to an end.<br />I therefore recommend that you sit down with this book when you have large chunks of time to devote to it, don't give up on the book after the first hundred or even two hundred pages but keep reading.  You will be rewarded.	2004-05-27

Perhaps the professionals get the book at a deeper level than the rest of us do.  Or perhaps they are just mistaking caricatures and muddled plot for biting satire and a revealing look at human nature.<br />First off, it is not really possible to review this book without serious spoilers since the most obvious part to review is the ending.  Several other reviewers have criticized it, so I will just say that I agree with the criticisms of other reviewers about abruptness and dropped characters and not get into the details.<br />Le Mariage is most likely a parable.  It tells the intertwined stories of two couples.  Anne-Sophie and Tim are engaged to be married.  Anne-Sophie is a French antiques dealer and a horse fancier.  Tim is half-Belgian and half-American.  He is a freelance journalist who writes primarily for a left-wing magazine and a right-wing magazine about European issues.<br />Near the beginning of the book, Tim meets and falls in lust with Clara Holly, a beautiful American-born actress who made one movie and now lives in the French countryside with her director-husband Serge.  Serge is Polish but grew up in America.<br />Of course, Tim's lust for Clara does not bode well for his impending marriage to Anne-Sophie.  Anne-Sophie feels him drawing away from her and turns to the romance books her mother wrote for advice--something that leads to the only truly funny parts of the books.  Those books tell her things like you need to speak in the heat of passion to your partner.  So she reads D.H. Lawrence and tries out a few phrases.  She is puzzled that Tim does not react well to this, so she looks to her mother's book for other advice.<br />The book begins in an interesting style.  It relates conversations and when characters make connections to events, it flashes back to the events.  Unfortunately, Johnson drops this style in favor of exploring the nature of love, miscommunications between men and women and differences between French people and Americans.<br />This she does rather badly.  Tim would have been an interesting character for this since he has a French-speaking mother and has spent most of his life in Europe but was born in America, has an American name and an American father.  However, Johnson utterly fails to use this.  In fact, Tim comes across as so American that every 30 pages or so, Johnson has to remind us that he is half-Belgian and explain that it is strange that he is taking such an American point of view.<br />There are also problems with Johnson's descriptions of the American and French side characters whom Johnson deliberately draws as caricatures for satire's sake, but come across as uninteresting rather than funny.<br />I would recommend re-reading Le Divorce and skipping this book.	2004-01-12

(I say read, but actually my wife read the book to me while I recovered from an eye trauma--this book works well as an out-loud book).<br />In the book, Libby Mason, a PR rep in Britain starts a fling with Nick, a not-yet-published writer who is &quot;on the dole.&quot;  She calls it a fling because Nick is not the type of man she wants to spend her life with.  She wants a rich man from the proper social circles who does not spend his spare time at pubs.<br />She meets just such a man in Ed, an investment banker.  But sparks don't fly with Ed.  So the book centers on the question of what a woman should do in such circumstances.<br />Since this is a rather conventional plot, Jane Green's interesting writing is the only thing that keeps the book going.  I found myself caring about the characters--including Libby's best friend and business clients, who have traumas of their own--much more than I should have, given the thin plot.<br />However, the book loses one star from a four-star review because of an odd quirk to it.  Libby will be thinking hard about an issue such as whether you should you be with a man who seems to love you but who does not kindle passion in you but then 30 pages later, Libby will say that she never really thought about that issue.  It is as if Green did not look back over what her characters had been thinking when she wrote a new chapter.  Still, this was a minor irritation in an otherwise enjoyable book.	2004-01-05

Trading Up seems to be made for this.  It is plot driven and not particularly written at a high grade level, so it is easy to follow when you're not doing the reading.<br />Janey is a Victoria's Secret model, a repeat character from Four Blondes.  She now has money and status enough to befriend a true New York socialite named Mimi.  But Janey wants more.  She wants to be taken seriously as something more than a model, she wants true love, she wants to secure her status, and she wants to escape her past, which is vaguely described as less-than-savory at the beginning.<br />Janey falls in love (or at least lust) at first sight with a foreign polo player named Zizi, who seems attracted to her, but does not start up a relationship with her.  Troubles ensue with Zizi, her husband who she marries on a whim because she convinces herself that she loves a movie producer who is madly in love (or at least lust) with her, and her past.<br />The book jacket blurb compares Bushnell's writing in this book to Edith Wharton or Jane Austen.  While the plot is owes much to Wharton and Austen, something Bushnell does without making it seem pretentious, of course the writing cannot match these great authors or even many of the medium ones to follow.<br />Still, the book is fun and easy to read.  I recommend this book as light reading.	2003-11-18

Of course, like all of the new Dune books, they shouldn't be compared to the old Dune series.  Frank Herbert was a genius, and it is unlikely that others would have been able to measure up.  Therefore, it is not right to judge them by the standard of the old series.<br />Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are ambitious in this book because they are writing on an almost completely clean slate.  In the previous books, they were writing about characters that had appeared in the original Dune book such as Leto Atreides, Vladimir Harkonnen, Duncan Idaho and others and their immediate ancestors.  Here, the authors created new characters with only the hints Frank Herbert had dropped about the Butlerian Jihad to guide them.<br />The authors of this book nevertheless came up with interesting characters, a lush vision of the universe, hints about plot lines that might or might not be developed, and some sizzling action scenes.<br />A few things can be improved.  The development of Vorian Atreides throughout the book will seem improbable to readers.  Frank Herbert sketched a deeply religious Butlerian Jihad, which would make sense given how much faith and will is necessary to overturn an entire social order.  Brian Herbert and Anderson talk about a Butlerian Jihad that has almost no religious content, except as an afterthought in a speech.  Of course, leaders can, of course, cynically use religion, but they have to lay a groundwork and people have to feel the fervor for it to catch on.<br />But these are minor criticisms.  As one reviewer put it, we do want to learn about the Butlerian Jihad, and the authors do a very credible job of bringing it to life.	2003-10-30

He only has a short while to do this, he has little information, and he is soon on the run.  <br />Robert Ludlum often uses one of two themes:  an everyman is suddenly put into a position where he has to save civilization even though he has no special skills (e.g., The Osterman Weekend and The Holcroft Covenant) or a man with very specific and useful skills has to save the world but is reluctant to draw on those skills (e.g., this book and The Bourne Identity).  <br />In The Aquitaine Progression, the hero learned his skills in a prison camp in Vietnam, but the horror of that experience and the dislike of the war make him unhappy to use them.  I think this category of Ludlum book is more plausible, because there is a reason why the hero is able to outwit his enemies.<br />Overall, the book is well-done with gripping action and suspense, as well as the ever-present worry that the hero is trusting the wrong people or not actually one step ahead of his foes even though he thinks he is.  Readers who like Ludlum will like this book.	2003-08-10

Ragtime tells the story of an unnamed family living in the early 20th Century.  But it also gives glimpses into the lives of all the famous people that tangentially touch the lives of the family, from Harry Houdini to Henry Ford to Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa.<br />The intricate interlacing of the story, with digressions that flow from the previous plot, but yet still have a staccato feel to them, mirrors the rags that were popular in music then and from which the book takes its name.<br />There is not much to the plot.  You should read the book for the atmosphere and vignettes about famous people, not because you want to become engrossed in the lives of interesting characters.  But it is an interesting story of life a century ago.	2003-08-10

And yet, flashes of the book still come to me.  The horrible story of how sausage was made, the way the meatpackers dealt with spoiled meat by taking out the bone, where the meat was most spoiled and using the rest of the meat anyway, etc.<br />Sinclair wrote this book as a socialist parable to reveal the horrors of American capitalism.  He thought that describing the meatpacking industry, an industry that Americans would really care about, would do the trick.  As a result, Sinclair researched the industry for a relatively short while and then wrote his book.  Perhaps he picked an industry that was too important to Americans because the book touched off a firestorm of reform about meatpacking, but no one was really interested in his socialist theories (with good reason, of course).<br />The book tells the story of Lithuanian immigrant Jurgis and his family.  Jurgis is a strong capable man who instantly gets a job in the meatpacking industry upon arriving in Chicago.  There, he sees first hand the unsanitary and cruel meatpacking industry.  This part of the book most grips the reader.  In order to show that socialism is for everybody, Sinclair takes Jurgis away from this job, gives him an even lowlier job, then makes him a hobo, the puts him in management, etc.  None of this works as well as the first part.<br />Of course, some of the horror stories apart from the story of meatpacking itself also give chills.  But the main reason to read this book is for the compelling story of the meat industry in early 20th Century America.	2003-08-10

I started with The Holcroft Covenant, reported to be one of the classics, which I really enjoyed.  Then I read the final book he wrote, The Prometheus Deception, which I enjoyed more than most.<br />This year, I decided to go back to his early books. I found the second book he ever wrote, The Osterman Weekend, in a used bookstore.  The book tells the story of John Tanner, a TV news executive who is summoned to Washington one day and told by a CIA operative that one or more of his best friends, the Ostermans, the Cardones and the Tremaynes is a traitor.  They are all gathering for the weekend at Tanner's house in suburban New Jersey and Tanner's job is to get the traitors to reveal themselves so the CIA can swoop in and deal with them.<br />On its own, the book is probably worth three stars.  It is a quick and easy read, the suspense grows and the reader has no idea where the plot will lead although double-crosses seem likely.  However, until the last few chapters, it doesn't really grip you.  <br />However, the book shows flashes of the greatness Ludlum achieved later.  An ordinary person is thrown into extraordinary circumstances and must get by on his own wits.  Ludlum is a genius at making the ordinary person seem believable and scared and yet be the hero who saved the world.  The action in the last few chapters is a foreshadowing of the wall-to-wall action that will be Ludlum's trademark in other books.  The insight this gives the reader into Ludlum's evolution as a writer was worth an extra star to me.	2003-07-14

As with all the books (in a series aimed at kids, continuity is good), the book begins in the summer with Harry at his uncle's and aunt's house being terminated by them and their son, Harry's cousin Dudley.  This book lingers a bit more on Harry's life during the summer, but eventually, he arrives back at Hogwarts and, as always, spends the year trying to learn about wizarding while going through agonies over Quidditch and trying to uncover and thwart the plots of Lord Voldemort and his allies.<br />Since this book is the longest of the series so far, Rowling goes through the story leisurely.  Except for a scene early on, the action of the book does not start until midway through the book.  Instead, we are treated to a lot of character building.  Harry is going through the difficulties of a teenager.  He doesn't always trust his friends, Ron and Hermione.  He doesn't always trust his mentor, Dumbledore.  And he is having real trouble sorting out how to deal with girls that he likes.<br />I had one minor problem with the book.  We also learn a lot about the wizard political world.  Wizard politics are prominent in this book because the wizard government appoints someone to look over Dumbledore's shoulder at Hogwarts, and this supplies much of the plot of the book.  Unfortunately, I think that Rowling made a wrong turn here.  I am not that interested in the political issues of the wizard world (in the same way that I am not interested in the political issues of the Jedi world in the Star Wars prequels).  <br />But Rowling's story-telling ability is so good, her continuing deepening of Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's character is so interesting, and the climax of the book is so much fun--leaving us hungry for the next book--that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix still deserves five stars.	2003-07-03

It was never difficult to decide to turn to the book, and it was easy to get through.  Nevertheless, the book left me disappointed.  <br />In the book, recent college graduate Andrea dreams of a job in the New Yorker, and decides to get a foot in the door by getting a job in magazine publishing.  After dropping her resume all over, she is interviewed and hired to be an assistant to the editor-in-chief of a fashion magazine.  The job is hard work, her boss demands the impossible, gives orders that are often unintelligible, or at least inexplicable, and Andrea works long hours.  <br />I know what you must be thinking, gee, sounds like the rest of us.  Of course, as an assistant to a fashion magazine editor, Andrea also has access to a seemingly limitless supply of free clothes and accessories.  Plus, it seems that her boss really will be able to get her closer to her dream job.  Now it seems that her job is really better than everybody else's job.<br />But Andrea's boss is truly inhuman to her, in a way similar to Nanny's boss in the Nanny Diaries.  It is interesting, in a guilty sort of way, to read what her boss will do to Andrea next.  But unlike in the Nanny Diaries, Andrea's boss's actions will not affect an innocent child.  Also, Andrea is a much less sympathetic and multi-dimensional character than Nanny is.<br />To sum up my conflicted feelings about this book, you probably will have a fun time reading this book, but at the end, you will not feel much for Andrea and might wish that the author had written the book with a bit more care and thought.	2003-06-25

The book has some extremely fun and provocative ideas.  People now take the last name of the company for which they work, schools are privatized and run by fast food or toy companies that see the kids as future customers.<br />If this seems like a pretty obvious attack on libertarianism and free markets, of course it is.  But the plot is enjoyable and will keep you turning the pages of this short book whether you agree with the political statement or not, although for people who disagree with the politics, you may end up throwing the book against the wall a few times.<br />In the book, Hack Nike is a low-level office worker at Nike.  He is peer pressured into signing a contract to do marketing work (a big step up for Hack) without reading the contract first.  The contract says that Hack has to kill some kids who buy Nike's newest shoes so that it will look like the shoes are so popular that kids are killing for them.  Unfortunately for Hack, contracts seem to be ironclad these days (although how this is possible in a society with almost no functioning government, and therefore, probably a dysfunctional court system, the book does not explain).<br />Luckily for Hack, a government agent, Jennifer Government, has a tip that Nike is planning to kill kids who buy the new shoes, and she is out to stop it.  There are suggestions that her motives aren't too pure.  She appears to have a past that is driving her to act.<br />The plot goes through many twists and turns, many betrayals by everyone, but it is easy to understand and quick reading.<br />My one complaint is that, with 2-3 page chapters, tons of characters and so much action packed into a 300 pagebook in large print, there is not much time to learn more about the characters.  Hopefully, Barry is thinking of a sequel in which we will learn more about Hack and Jennifer and the rest.  Hopefully the lack of character development was just marketing so that people will want to know more about the characters.	2003-04-21

Of course, the Victorian-era writing and social commentary also made an impression.<br />But upon reflection, underneath all of this is a story of people with difficult lives learning to find and accept each other and hopefully coming to peace and happiness despite long odds.  Maybe my second reading just comes from a twenty-first century mind reading things into a nineteenth century book that just aren't there.  But to me, the book does have the feel of a modern story of hardship as well as a Victorian story of people trying to overcome their backgrounds to find love.<br />Jane Eyre tells the life story of an orphaned girl sent away to a harsh boarding school by a cruel aunt.  Despite the harsh nature of the school, Jane thrived at the school since she is finally out from her aunt's crushing dislike for her.  She graduated and took a job as a governess for a girl in the care of a mysterious man who spent much of his time traveling abroad, Mr. Rochester.<br />At first, the two do not like each other.  This is compounded by the fact that Jane thinks she is plain looking and not worthy of his company.  But the two develop a peculiar friendship, and there are many signs that their feelings are deeper.  But Mr. Rochester is busy courting other ladies at the time.  Mr. Rochester also seems to have a secret that he will not divulge to Jane but may have serious consequences for her.<br />Jane's job as a governess and the friendship that develops make it seem that the book will quickly become a Jane Austen book (which of course, would not have been a bad thing) in which the man and woman from different classes find love with one another, but from the point of the friendship blooming, Jane Eyre takes a few remarkable twists and turns that I had not expected and that make for real page-turning.<br />But it is as much the quiet desperation of both Jane and Mr. Rochester and their struggle to find each other despite this that makes Jane Eyre a book truly worth reading and treasuring.s much the quiet desperation of both Jane and Mr. Rochester and their struggle to find each other despite this that makes Jane Eyre a book truly worth reading and treasuring.	2003-04-07

This is, pardon the expression, the granddaddy of them all. It tells the story of the Buendia family who left a town near the coast and traveled through the mountains to found the town of Macondo in the interior of the country. <br />The plot tells the story of several generations of the family and chronicles, in an almost off-hand way, the revolutions/civil wars that plagued Colombia throughout its history, the amazements of invention and technology of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the strength and drama of family, and of course the romance in life. <br />If this is the first Garcia book you read, it will take some time to get used to the book. The characters have similar names, and the story twists and turns through time, going back and forth almost at will. The characters and the author all accept magical events as commonplace. A few of the deeper thoughts may be difficult to understand; I know there were some sentences that were too deep for me. But, above all, you will be charmed by the beautiful writing, engrossed by the plot and in love with the world that Garcia creates.	2003-03-06

After discussing this speech for a while, we passed on to Napoleon, but before we did, one student asked the professor for recommendations for further reading on the Reign of Terror.  He mentioned Twelve Who Ruled.  I didn't run out and buy the book, but I did keep in the back of my mind, and whenever I browsed the history shelves of a bookstore or library, I kept an eye out for it.  Several years later, I ran across the book and, after reading it, I am quite glad that I did.<br />The Reign of Terror is, of course, a fascinating period of history that usually gets short shrift in high school or college classes.  One hears of guillotines and revolutionaries run wild, killing each other for not being radical enough.  This book fleshes out the story and dispels some myths about it.<br />Robespierre was a member of the Committee on Public Safety, a legislative committee that was part of the National Assembly, France's short-lived revolutionary parliament set up in the 1790s.  The Committee consisted of twelve people, hence the title of the book:  \\"The Twelve Who Ruled.\\"  <br />Palmer describes how the Committee functions and gives a very plausible explanation for the reasons behind Robespierre's and his fellow committee members' actions.  Given the nature of the period, it is no surprise that the book is not boring.  But Palmer did not sacrifice academic rigor for readability.<br />I recommend this book for anyone interested in history or political science.	2003-02-01

I would argue that it is more about the making of the OED than it is about its two main characters, and so, the title is a bit backwards, but let's blame that on the editors rather than the author.<br />Winchester tells the story of the creation of the earliest English dictionaries in the 17th Century, followed hard upon by Dr. Johnson's famous dictionary.  He also explains why a comprehensive English dictionary still had not been published by the late 19th Century and describes the efforts of the Philological Society in England to rectify this fact.  <br />Winchester explains how the OED is different from almost all dictionaries.  Not only does it attempt to be complete--a very hard task for the English language--but it defines the nuances of the definition of words through quotations throughout the centuries as well as through definitions.  Winchester describes the manner in which the dictionary project started, its reliance on volunteers as well as dedicated editors, its fits and starts, and eventually its triumph.<br />Winchester intersperses the story of the dictionary with the story of Dr. William Minor, an American medical doctor who killed an Englishman and was confined to an insane asylum as a result and contributed many quotations to the OED to fill his time.  He also spends a few sections discussing the life of the general editor of the OED for most of its first edition, James Murray, and discussing the relationship between Murray and Minor.<br />The parts of the book about Minor (and to a lesser extent Murray) are chiefly interesting because they seem to be the work of Herodotus or Thucydides rather than a modern-day writer.  There are many fictional accounts of conversations, rank speculation about the causes of Minor's insanity and later of the impulses guiding Minor towork on the OED or stop working on it, as the case may be.  <br />Winchester does catch our attention by intentionally misleading us at one important place (described in another review for those who want to see the spoiler) and only later providing the correct facts.  He also gives a rather lurid account of the shooting that results in Minor's incarceration and later of an injury Minor suffers.  But on the whole, the description of Minor and Murray is the weakest part of the book and causes the book to lose 2 stars in my rating.<br />To end on a positive note, each chapter begins with a definition of a word from the OED.  These were uniformly interesting and gave sometimes direct and sometimes oblique clues about what the contents of the chapter would be.	2003-01-22

I have several serious criticisms of the book, but I think many things were well done.  Let me first list the positives and then all the negatives.<br />A People's History of the Supreme Court gives a brief biography of every justice who has ever served on the Supreme Court and interwoven with this, gives a description of some of the most important cases the Supreme Court has decided.  In the case descriptions, the author explains, in plain language, the legal issues involved (I think it's plain language, but I'm a lawyer, and law school is very good at teaching lawyers not to speak or understand plain language).  He also often describes the history of the legal issue, why it was important to the nation, what the country thought of the legal issue at the time.  Finally, he gives a brief story of the actual case itself--who the parties were, why they decided to file the suit, why they appealed their case all the way to the Supreme Court, etc.<br />This is all very important stuff.  It is great to have it all collected into one book.  Too often, we don't know anything about the people who bring their cases to the Supreme Court but merely know their names.  It is important to remember that the cases involved real people with real disputes or heartfelt issues that they wanted the court to resolve.  <br />We also know almost nothing about the Supreme Court justices who preceded this one.  But they are, in many ways, as powerful or more powerful than the Presidents.  They had real-world experience before becoming judges and sometimes cast aside that experience, but sometimes didn't.  <br />I found the book extremely interesting and read it quickly from cover to cover.<br />But the book had many flaws:  there are factual errors.  Some are described in previous reviews.  One that I found is that the author incorrectly describes the purposes and text of the 12th Amendment when discussing the Hayes-Tilden election in the late 19th Century.  So, although it is important to know everything that is in this book, a reader can't always trust that he or she is getting correct information.  <br />Second, I do not have a problem, as others do, that the author states his political views early and often in this book.  I agree with the author that it is better for the author to be honest and forthright about biases and let the reader decide if he or she agrees with the author than for the author to pretend to be completely unbiased.  My problem is that the author often distorts the record of justices to fit with his opinion of them--an unforgivable sin.  <br />For instance, Irons believes that the first Justice Harlan is a great justice.  So he describes his opinion dissenting to oppose segregation in Plessy v. Ferguson as a great opinion, but does not even allude to the fact that, in the middle of this great opinion, he hurls racial insults at, as Harlan describes it, the \\"Chinese race.\\"  His views of some of our earliest justices, Story and John Marshall are cramped because he wants to tear them down.<br />Third, I think Irons should have left out the first couple of chapters on the framing of the Constitution.  It is a bit tangential to the subject matter of the book and has been done better by more serious historians.<br />Finally, Irons misses the biggest story of the late 20th Century with a cop out.  He ends his book in 1992 but publishes the book in 1999.  Between 1992 and 1999, the Supreme Court did a great many things--basically reviving doctrines that had been abandoned in the 1930s.  Perhaps Irons got tired and after researching for several years, decided not to add a whole chapter on the revolutionary Rehnquist Court.  But if so, he should have explained that to us.  Instead, he cops out and says that nothing important has happened since 1992.<br />All in all, if you are interested in the Supreme Court, you should read this book.  My guess is that you will find it an easy read and be very interested in it, but wind up frustrated with Irons.	2002-12-30

The book tells the story of Willy Loman, a traveling salesman, and his wife and two children.  The \\"present day\\" in the story is about Willy near the end of his career.  He is getting too old to travel around and to hustle to sell products.  He also appears to be not quite right in the head any more.  His oldest son has returned from the West where he has been doing odd jobs but not making much out of his life.  Everyone is worried about Willy, including his neighbor and his boss.  Unfortunately, Willy's boss is more concerned with the profits of the company.<br />The story flashes back to earlier times in several scenes.  These stories mainly tell the story of more triumphant times for Willy.  He is a good salesman and he's adored by his wife and children.  One gets the sense that he is ready to hit it big.  He rejects his brother's plan for a get rich quick scheme because he is doing so well in sales.<br />We are never quite sure how much of Willy's past is accurate.  Like many good salesmen, Willy is used to promoting his products with little exaggerations.  It seems that Willy's talent in sales bleeds over to his personal life, so that he is always doing a little worse than he says he is.  It is unclear how much worse in these earlier days.  However Willy is doing, it seems that his life has taken a turn for the worse.  His oldest son is also doing much worse.  He was the star quarterback in high school and is headed for great things with a scholarship to college.  But he has lost his way at least as much as Willy.<br />The play answers some of these questions.  Many of them are answered by the fact that life is hard sometimes and we make bad choices.  Others seem to be answered by nothing besides fate.  Also, as you can see by some of these reviews, the answers are different for different people.  It is easy to pull some things out of this play when you are done, but it is almost impossible to figure out everything.<br />In any event, I strongly recommend you read this book and see the play live or on video.  You will love them both.gs out of this play when you are done, but it is almost impossible to figure out everything.<br />In any event, I strongly recommend you read this book and see the play live or on video.

US	52050206	R3FFE2QOL3RUVC	0451527569	165299353	The House of Mirth (Signet Classics)	Books	5	23	25	N	N	An American Classic	High school students are often assigned Ethan Frome, and the Age of Innocence gained many readers because of the movie, but this is the Edith Wharton book that everyone should read.  In many ways, this is similar to a Jane Austen book in which a member of the upper echelon of society has money problems and needs to marry well in order to stay at the same level of society.  Forces and other people are contriving against her, but there seems to be at least one man who would be a good match for reasons of love.  The first twist here is that the good match is not financially well off and therefore won't be able to support the heroine as she wants to be supported.<br />Lily Bart was orphaned many years ago, and her family had been financially ruined before that.  However, she is accustomed to beautiful things and wants to continue to live at the top level of society.  Unfortunately, her heart and soul long for more than these creature comforts.  She yearns for excitement, intellectual and emotional honesty and probably true love, although she is confused about that.  As she has gotten towards her late 20s, her prospects are dwindling and the only person who has the resources to support her and is already a part of polite society is Percy Gryce, a singularly boring man.<br />Lily rebels against Gryce just as she is about to marry him when she has a couple of heartfelt conversations with Lawrence Selden, a person she decides she might love, but who makes clear that he is not rich enough to support her as well as she should be supported.  <br />Her choices other than Gryce are slim.  There is Simon Rosedale, who is portrayed as an upwardly mobile person and therefore undesirable.  He is also Jewish, which Wharton never overtly says is a problem with him for Lily, but probably figures into Lily's calculus (Wharton mainly talks about his Jewishness in the context of saying that Rosedale is more patient and able to face disappointment than others in his position because of what his people have dealt with over the centuries).<br />I have to admit that, unlike Ethan Frome and The Age of Innocence, it took me a while to get into this book.  Perhaps, I picked up this book to read a story of Old New York and manners and was not ready for such an intense character study.  But once I got to page 100, the last 250 pages went by in a flash.  It is beautiful and eminently interesting.  You will be interested in every twist in the story.<br />A couple of words of caution.  If you buy this edition with the Anna Quindlen introduction, DON'T READ THE INTRODUCTION FIRST.  It gives away too much in the first page--when I stopped reading it until after I finished--and the rest of the introduction gives away the rest of the plot.  Finally, as with Jane Austen books, the actions of the male characters are often either inscrutable or irrational.  It may be that men actually acted like this in the early 20th Century (or 19th for Austen).  But I think it more likely that Wharton is misconstruing the male characters in ways that male authors almost always do with female characters.  But this is a minor flaw, especially since Lily is so central to this book.	2002-11-21
US	52050206	R3RP9QMBRNM60T	0375753206	12564777	The Age of Innocence (Modern Library 100 Best Novels)	Books	5	5	7	N	N	A Look at Old New York	All of Edith Wharton's books about New York society are, of course, a glimpse of an older society for us.  The Age of Innocence stands out, however, because it was a nostalgic book for Edith Wharton.  She wrote this book after World War I and looked back at an earlier age.  Interestingly, this makes the book more rather than less resonant today.  It resonates because we read this book mainly to see what society was once like.  And Edith Wharton was writing for the same purpose--although for her it was more of a trip down memory lane.  We struggle between rooting for characters to break free from social constraints that have since passed away and thinking that maybe these constraints created a happier society.  I got the sense that Wharton was doing the same thing.<br />The book tells the story of Newland Archer who is engaged to May.  May's cousin, Countess Olenska, comes to town escaping from a bad marriage.  Countess Olenska grew up in New York but moved to Europe.  She loves the newness and rationality of the New World, but has Old World mystery around her.  Newland is quickly intrigued by her.  <br />The rest of the book revolves around the triangle of May, Newland and the Countess.  It often focuses on the mores of the society, the attempts of the Countess to become at home in New York, May's attempts to be good to her cousin and yet make a good marriage with Newland and Newland's struggle between his background in society and his rational view that that society's rules should be cast aside.<br />I would, however, recommend reading this more for the view of New York than for the plot.  One example:  we quickly accept the view that Newland, his family and his relations are the pinnacle of New York society.  However, Wharton throws us a curveball.  Newland goes to the van der Luydens to ask a favor.  And we learn that Newland is really not at the pinnacle of society.  The van der Luydens stand on another level and Newland's tier of society exists at the heels ofthis society.  Throughout the book, Wharton gives us similar little nuggets of what American society once was like.<br />I sincerely recommend this book.	2002-11-19

Needless to say, I was not ready for the horror of 1984.  Animal Farm tells the tragedy of a revolution against tyranny sliding into its own tyranny but it tells the story through the eyes of pigs and horses and dogs.  1984 not only tells the story through human eyes, but it tells a much more horrifying tale of the ease with which people with modern propaganda and technological tools can form a seemingly invincible totalitarian government with popular support.<br />Although this may sound a bit trite, Orwell also gives everyone reading 1984 a wake-up call about how easy it is to give away freedom and how easy it is for a government to use any decrease in people's vigilance regarding their own freedoms and turn the world into a nightmare.<br />One of the interesting parts of the book is the fact that the government in 1984 is creating a new language of drastically decreased vocabulary and increased technobabble that will stop people from being able to think and speak creatively or to find the words to rebel against totalitarian rule.<br />However, in writing the book, Orwell himself created an entirely new vocabulary to discuss overreaching and totalitarian government.  Terms like \\"Big Brother,\\" \\"thought police,\\" \\"thought crime\\" and, to a lesser degree \\"double think\\" as well as the title of the book itself have become parts of our vocabulary in fighting against totalitarianism.  Thus, in imagining a world in which the government is doing away with people's ability to speak out, Orwell helped spawn a whole vocabulary to help people protest.	2002-11-13

First, he goes for three weeks to a Swiss sanatorium to visit his cousin, partly for a vacation before he starts his job and partly to convince his cousin, a soldier, that he should rejoin the real world rather than stay in the sanatorium.  Castorp gets a check-up from the doctor, learns that he is ill and remains for seven years.  <br />Mann originally started this book as a novella parody of sanatoriums and medicine in the early 20th Century, when doctors were first saying that disease was created by organisms and were enamored with the power of the newly discovered x-rays.  However, Mann stopped the novella at the beginning of World War I, and came back to it at after the war, realizing that he had a lot to say and that this story might be a good vehicle through which to say it.<br />After all, the sanatorium's clientele were the new rich and the old upper class of all the different countries of Europe who began the war.  The doctors acted both as the leaders who led them through the insanity and the scientists who made the mechanized, horrible war possible.  And Hans Castorp was the age of the soldiers, following the leaders, the aristocracy, the scientists and the intellectuals into battle.<br />You can read all this into the book, if you wish.  The doctors are firm in their belief that they are helping their patients, but are not above shenanigans like &quot;proving&quot; with little evidence that patients should stay year-round, rather than leave for the summer in order to line their wallets.  Herr Settembrini and later Herr Nafta are the intellectuals filling Castorp with ideas that seem sometimes benign and sometimes diabolical.  Castorp is a young, impressionable man who falls madly in love for a fellow patient, Clavdia, but has no outlet for his emotion, except during Carnival--a truly amazing scene, which alone is enough to make the book worthwhile.  No wonder this continent was plunged into a tragic war that left Mann with the need to write this beautiful, tragic book.<br />I, however, was more interested in Mann's thoughts about of life in general that permeate this book.  My favorite example is the way Mann talks about the concept of &quot;getting used to getting used.&quot;  He describes it in the sense of Castorp who never gets used to the thin air in the Alps and therefore always winds up redfaced and short of breath.  However, Castorp does get used to always being redfaced and short of breath.  Therefore, he gets used to getting used to the Alps.  <br />This is what part of life is.  We are unhappy with many parts of our life (maybe a job, maybe family, maybe friends or lack of friends, or financial resources) and we never get used to that.  It leaves us with an empty feeling somewhere in our soul and no way to get rid of it.  We never get used to this problem and thus the empty feeling never goes away.  But we get used to the empty place in our soul and think of it only occasionally.  But it is there crying out.  <br />What a sad thought about life.  The solution, of course, is to listen to the part that is crying out rather than squelching it and to try to do something about it.  But it is often easier to get used to getting used to a situation than it is to fix the situation.  It is easier for Castorp to stay in the mountains rather than breathing normally.<br />Overall, an excellent book, with ideas that I had never even come close to thinking of before.	2002-10-28

Stand By Me was based on Stephen King's story The Body and The Shawshank Redemption was based on Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.<br />Both of these novellas were extremely well written and show that Stephen King's primary talent is not for horror but for storytelling.  The two stories grab you and keep you turning the pages until they are done and leave you wishing for more.<br />The Body is a maturation story involving preteen boys who are on the cusp of throwing away their lives but two of whom have an excellent chance to mature into kind, happy adults.  It is a poignant story of childhood.  King manages what few authors can:  he makes preteens sound like preteens rather than adults or babies.<br />Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is the story of an adult sent to prison for murdering his wife.  In prison, he learns how to be truly human and also tutors his friends in how to make it through a prison term without losing the ability to live life on the outside.  It is an outstanding story.<br />Apt Pupil has also been made into a movie--this time one of the same name.  It is the flip side of Stand By Me.  It tells the story of a teenager who is at the cusp of maturing into a normal adult but gets seduced by evil.  The boy discovers that a neighborhood man was once a Nazi war criminal.  Rather than turning him in, he talks the man into reliving his experience with the boy.  It is chilling to see how easy it is for someone who has discovered something evil to get caught up in the evil.  However, the boy and the older man are not fleshed out well enough to make the story as good as it could have been.<br />The last story is a supernatural tale.  It is quirky and told in a different way from most of King's works.  The edges are fuzzy; it is more atmosphere than plot.  I enjoyed it,but it may not be for everyone.	2002-10-15

These books have told the story of the political maneuverings that led up to the Atreides arrival on Arrakis/Dune that sets in motion the ascent of Paul to the throne and to messiah status.  <br />All of these books deal with the feud between the Harkonnens and the Atreides.  But these books add extremely interesting layers regarding the personalities of the emperor, the Ixians, the Tleilaxu and many others throughout the galaxy.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and the various characters seem to be similar to how Frank Herbert would have imagined them, although, of course, not nearly as textured as Frank would have made them.<br />The writers are good storytellers and the universe that Frank Herbert imagined makes it very easy to spin a good yarn.  The authors are clearly not deep thinkers like Frank Herbert was.  This can be seen by the fact that the authors begin each chapter with a saying, a quote from an imagined book or something similar.  While I always looked forward to the next quote by Frank Herbert, I am hard-pressed not to skip the quotes in these books.  They are often little more than fortune cookie sayings.<br />The books continue to contain little editing problems.  At the beginning, for instance, Liet-Kynes goes to Kaitan to meet with the emperor and is introduced as Liet-Kynes.  In Dune, it is clear that no non-Fremen know that the planetologist Kynes is also the Fremen Liet.  There is also a problem with what happens to de Vries in this book because in Dune, the Baron tells de Vries that he wrongly predicted that Jessica would bear a daughter, which would have been impossible if events occurred as they do in House Corrino.<br />But overall, I don't fault the authors much for these mistakes.  Frank Herbert created a hugely complex world and I am sure I would have made at least equally glaring mistakes (and that editors would not have caught them) if I had written this book.<br />I now look forward to reading the prequel to the prequels that has just come out on the Butlerian Jihad.	2002-10-04

After reading it, one can't stop remembering the tragic plot of a Nazi death camp survivor, her life in Poland and the camps and her post-war relationship with an unstable man in New York.  However, the book is about much more as well.  In the narrator Stingo's lyrical words, it is about a \\"voyage of discovery in a place as strange as Brooklyn.\\"<br />The book begins with Stingo being fired/quitting a Manhattan publishing job and taking a summer off to write the great American novel in a rooming house in Brooklyn.  Stingo is an innocent in life and the ways of love.  In the rooming house, he meets the sensual holocaust survivor, Sophie, his upstairs neighbor and her across-the-hall neighbor and lover, the brilliant and yet haunted Nathan.  It is odd that Nathan is the haunted one, because Sophie is a survivor of Auschwitz, the Polish Nazi death camp while Nathan is a pharmaceutical researcher with a beautiful lover.<br />Stingo immediately falls in love with Sophie, but is also impressed by Nathan who takes Stingo under his wing as his protege of sorts.  Stingo spends the summer writing and trying to lose his innocence in the ways of love.  The plot lines dealing with the latter are graphic and may turn some people away.  But people too young to be exposed to the language probably shouldn't read this book anyway because of the explicitness of the holocaust plot.<br />Sophie gives clues about what happened to her in Poland during the war both inside and outside the death camp, but nothing prepares you for the actual final story she tells about her experiences.  Reading that story will almost make you forget the beauty and lyricism of the rest of the book, but in looking back, you will realize that the book is an amazing combination of the beauty of life and the horror of it all twisted together in one perfect whole.<br />I heartily recommend this book.	2002-09-27

I loved the story of Milo, a kid who is bored and dislikes life who receives a gift completely out of the blue (what kid wouldn't like that).  I liked the fact that the gift was a gateway to an adventure in another world.  I liked the dog he meets who is gruff at first but becomes Milo's best friend.  I also loved the strange characters Milo met on his adventures, and I was scared of the monsters he met near the end of the book.<br />As I grew older, I started to learn all of the puns and double meanings strewn throughout the book.  I still loved the adventure story, but now I began realizing that the book was very funny as well.<br />During some move or other, I lost the book, but now I look forward to buying it when I have kids and rediscovering the world Norton Juster painted in the Phantom Tollbooth with them.	2002-09-23

At the same time, he wakes up to his ability to travel to an alternate world that is in desperate trouble.  Several years later, the authors teamed up again to write a good sequel, the recently published Black House.<br />The alternate world is populated by \\"twinners\\" of our world--people who are similar in personality, motives and looks as people in our world, but who are their own distinct person, mostly unaware that their twinner exists.<br />Jack's twinner was murdered at an early age, which makes Jack very special.  Most people die soon after their twinner dies.  The two worlds are connected in other ways; something that happens in one world has an effect in the other world.<br />In this world, Jack's mother was a B movie actress.  She was a great actress but never quite got the right breaks.  In the other world, she is a queen.  Jack's mission, to go to a mysterious location in California to rescue a talisman will save both his mother and the queen, the mother of his twinner.<br />King and Straub write extremely well together.  It is hard to tell when one is writing or when the other is writing, or who suggested what idea.  The alternate world they paint is quite interesting and well done.  They also are able to maintain the child-like perspective of their main character, Traveling Jack.  They also create a beautiful character in Jack's sidekick, Wolf, a good werewolf from the alternate world.  <br />Finally, despite the fact that it seems almost impossible that a child would be able to manage all of the adventures that Jack goes through in his cross-country journey, King and Straub are such good writers that you easily suspend your disbelief and read the story sharing in Jack's adventures and fears.<br />This is a very good book.  If you go out and buy the sequel, Black House, without reading this book, you will be missing something.	2002-09-14

I turn to the Times cookbook when I want to make my old standbys, when I am trying something new or when I have company coming over.  Of course, I was raised by a mother who used an older edition of this book as her main cookbook, so I may be a bit biased.<br />The cookbook has everything out there you need to start cooking.  When I first started cooking, I was able to pick up this cookbook and start with almost no background.  All the recipes turned out excellent.  I particularly liked the chili recipes.<br />Last year, I mixed and matched these recipes with ones typed on index cards that I inherited from my grandmother and made a successful Thanksgiving dinner (which may be the ultimate praise for a cookbook).<br />One warning:  recipes in this cookbook are not shortcuts.  They will take a decent time to prepare.  If I am in a hurry, I don't usually use this cookbook.  If you never have much time to prepare a meal or do not enjoy cooking, this is probably not the book for you.	2002-09-07

However, someone gave me this book a couple of weeks ago and I read it in a couple of hours.<br />The book is a short work by Mitch Albom, a sports reporter in Detroit and on ESPN.  Albom heard on Nightline one night that Morrie Schwartz, his favorite college professor, one with whom he had developed a real friendship at school, was dying from ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease).  Albom had not seen or talked to his professor since then.  However, Albom called his professor, was invited over, and then, at the professor's request continued to visit him while recording their conversations to transform into a book, or as the two of them described it, a final thesis.<br />The story that emerges is a combination of Morrie's reflections of life, how to be happy, how to feel satisfied at the end of it, and so forth and Morrie's reflections of what it was like to know you are dying and watch your body wither away.<br />None of Morrie's ideas are particularly novel.  Morrie tells us that we should be good to each other and that we should care more about being happy than making money or buying things.  Morrie is sad about his body deteriorating, but he tells us that if you live a good life, you can go through even this horrible death without worrying that you didn't do enough in life.  However, Albom tells Morrie's lessons to us clearly and, as much as is possible, without lecturing us.  The story of Morrie's last months is, of course, tragic, but worth reading.<br />The only part I disliked was Albom's interspersed story of his own life.  Albom starts telling us a bit about his life in college, and that was interesting, but then Albom switches to the present.  I guess the point is that Albom wants us to know that he had lost his way but that he was taking Morrie's lessons to heart.  It seemed an unnecessary addition to the story.  Better to let Morrie's lessons speak for themselves.	2002-09-05

Asimov came up with the idea of a planet in a 5 sun system.  There are almost always 2 or 3 suns in the sky.  On rare occasions, there is one sun in the sky, but never are there 0 sun in the sky.  However, unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the planet (since it is never night and they do not see stars), the solar system also contains another planet the rotation of which causes an eclipse once in a great while.  The eclipse just happens to always occur on a day in which only one sun in the sky.  Therefore, during the eclipse, the planet experiences night.<br />Asimov wrote a short story about this planet and Silverberg and Asimov extended it to a full-length novel.  I loved the novel and later found the short story and thought that was extremely well-done too.<br />In the novel, a group of scientists discover that the eclipse and the nightfall are imminent just at the same time as archeologists discover that societies have risen and fallen on the planet at regular intervals.  The only other people who believe night is coming are the priests of a religion with whom the scientists do not get along.  Thus, society is unprepared for nightfall despite the warnings of the scientists and the priests.  Devastation follows during night as well as during the eternal day following the night.<br />Asimov and Silverberg do a compelling job setting up the discovery that night is coming.  Their description of the actual eclipse and the reaction to it is truly fantastic.  I also enjoyed (although a little bit less so) the description of the shambles of society after the day dawned again and, again, a little bit less, the rest of the story, although the characters have been written so well by this point that you really care what happens to them.  The end could have been handled a lot better.  The book ends abruptly, and, I think, in an unlikely way.<br />However, the ending is nothing that should stop you from reading this extremely well-done book about a truly creative idea.	2002-08-27
US	52050206	R2O04SFZD2YMJG	0374525749	627065254	The Odyssey	Books	5	33	37	N	N	A Readable Classic	First and foremost, the Odyssey is a great tale.  It is at heart an adventure story of Odysseus's return to his home after the 10 year Trojan War.  Because Odysseus has upset the wrong god, he has to spend another 10 years journeying home.  Meanwhile, suitors for his wife, Penelope's, hand have gathered at his home trying to win her heart, and, in the meantime, eating Odysseus out of house and home.<br />Homer picks up the tale in medias res (in the middle of things).  Much of Odysseus's journey is told as a flashback, and it is wonderful to read of the adventures fighting a Cyclops, being lured by sirens, escaping witches, even having a brush with the underworld.  Through it all, the book is still a tale of a family reuniting (although Odysseus is not the most faithful husband).  There is even a heartbreaking scene when Odysseus sees his old dog again after being gone for 20 years.<br />Robert Fitzgerald's translation is just what one wants for the Odyssey.  Fitzgerald stresses the poetry of Homer's epic poem.  He also strives to make the book readable.  I do not know ancient Greek, but it does not appear that Fitzgerald sacrifices much to achieve this.  The book is still deep and rich, yet bubbling with life at the top.<br />If you are looking for more of a transliteration, Richard Lattimore's translation is probably closer to what you want.	2002-08-23
US	52050206	RFZJ5QWQBZYSC	0226469409	627065254	The Iliad of Homer	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Great Translation of THE Classic	Almost everyone knows the story of the Iliad.  A Trojan, Paris, steals a Greek king's wife, Helen.  The Greek king, Menelaus, assembles an army of all of the other Greek kings and they sail to Troy to defeat the city and recapture Helen.<br />There is more to the beginning of the story (it all starts with Paris judging a contest between 3 goddesses).  There is more to the story (it ends, and the Odyssey and later the Aeneid pick up, after Greece defeats Troy through the device of the Trojan Horse) but Homer does not tell this story.  Homer picks up the story in the last year of the war.  Much of the story is of bickering Greeks, and especially a spoiled Achilles, and noble Trojans, especially Hector.  It has plenty of intrigue, suspense, and, of course war.  It makes for fabulous reading.<br />Of course, the Iliad is first and foremost, one of the earliest texts of western literature.  It was originally sung by a blind bard during a sort of &quot;dark ages&quot; of Greek history.  An earlier Greek civilization had been literate but had fallen.  Later on, centuries after Homer, Greek civilization would rise again.  Homer would be lost to the world except that the Iliad was repeated throughout the centuries (most likely with various additions and subtractions) and then written down during the golden age.  Homer himself was so lost that it was no longer possible even to tell what he had written.  Later Greeks thought he wrote both the Iliad and the Odyssey, but modern scholars say no.<br />Of course, a review of the Iliad must spend a decent amount of space on the translation to be complete.  I once picked up a different translation of the Iliad while I had my Lattimore translation on me and they looked completely different.<br />My college professor had us read the Lattimore translation of the Iliad and the Fitzgerald translation of the Odyssey.  It is, of course, impossible to translate Homer without conveying a sense of the poetry, but Lattimore opts for more of a transliteration of Homer's work, while Fitzgerald is tilted towards poetry.  It may be superficial, but it is also a plus to me that Lattimore transliterates the names, so you wind up reading about Achilleus and Klytaimestra rather than Achilles and Klytemnestra.<br />I thought reading the different translation was a great idea and I am therefore partial to both translators but would suggest that you follow my college professor's views and by one Lattimore and one Fitzgerald translation if you are reading both the Iliad and the Odyssey.a transliteration of Homer's work, while Fitzgerald is tilted towards poetry.

My roommate had a Martin Yan cookbook in college 10 years ago when I was just learning how to cook.  I remember I was able to follow the recipes without diverging from them and end up with great food.  <br />Now, I've grown more experienced in the kitchen and bought this book last year.  I learned that the recipes here work just as well if you don't follow them strictly but introduce your own variations, change sauces, change from deep fried to stir fried or vice versa, and so forth.  So I recommend Yan's books for either a beginner of an expert.<br />Finally, as long as you don't mind spending a bit of time chopping lots of ingredients, the recipes are fast and don't take much work or skill.  I have never been to China, but I do know that I am now making Chinese dishes that are as good as many of the dishes at my local Chinese restaurant or the Chinatown restaurants using Yan's recipes.	2002-08-23

Like all the rest, except, of course, for the first one I read (Microserfs), I had to get over my disappointment at how different this book was from the last Coupland book I read.  Coupland generally makes his characters so interesting that I pick up the next book hoping, irrationally, that it is basically a sequel.<br />Coupland never fails to make his characters interesting whether they are likeable or not, make his plots engaging and his commentary on life apt and poignant.<br />In All Families Are Psychotic, a family has gathered together to see a space shuttle launch taking one of its members into space.  The astronaut had birth defects because her mother took thalidomide while she was pregnant.  The family has many other problems--mainly because all of the things that would cause other families to have issues with each other (the parents getting divorced, the oldest son feeling disaffected with life, etc.) caused terrible injuries and diseases in this family.<br />Coupland shows how a family can still love each other and survive even the terrible tragedies that befall it in this book, while spicing it up with the normal Coupland humor involving the craziness of people and this world exaggerated to all extremes.<br />If you like Coupland, I am sure you will like this book.	2002-08-16

At the beginning, I have to say that it was extremely eerie and disturbing to read this book dealing with child kidnapping during a summer in which the media is so focused on this issue.  So, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who isn't ready to read this subject matter.  But for people who regularly read Stephen King-like works, I am sure you can handle it.<br />Black House is a sequel to the other book co-written by King and Straub, The Talisman.  It is also a step in the process of filling out the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; saga that King has most directly written about in &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; and its 3 sequels.  I would warn you against this book if you haven't read either &quot;The Talisman&quot; or the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; saga, but I would guess that you would find this book interesting if you have read one but not the other.<br />With all these disclaimers, let me say that this book is mainly about the kidnapping of a child and a little American town's reaction to the kidnapping (and previous ones by the same serial kidnapper/murderer).  King and Straub paint a very accurate picture of a town about to descend into chaos over these terrible events--a town worried about who is in its midst, about to unfairly cast blame and about to do violence.  The town's reaction is very understandable, but quite chilling.<br />Jack Sawyer, the hero of The Talisman, comes in to save the town.  Sawyer is now an adult of 31 years and has taken early retirement from his job as a Los Angeles policeman.  He has retired to the town but is coaxed out of retirement.  Jack enters the scene much like a hero gunslinger in Wild West movies (or in the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series).  He is joined for much of the tale by Henry Leyden, one of the more remarkable adult characters King has created (I am not familiar with Straub's other works).  Henry sort of actspartly as one of those blind prophets from Greek tragedies and partly as a kind and gentle soul amongst all the horrors.<br />The book actually spends very little time in the Territories, an alternate world in which so much of &quot;The Talisman&quot; took place.  As a result, there is also much less explicit action than in &quot;The Talisman,&quot; where Jack is chased repeatedly by the bad guys.  But the wonderfulness of the Territories is central to the book as is the terribleness that also lurks there and in other worlds besides.<br />Finally, I want to discuss my minor quibbles.  First, Jack spends a lot of time not remembering his previous time in the Territories and not wanting to get involved in the case.  This seems artificial to me.  For one thing, there is no reason for King and Straub to resort to amnesia to create suspense, they are good at suspense without such a device.  For another thing, everyone knows Jack will overcome his amnesia and get involved.  <br />And, my last quibble:  Why would such a good person like Jack not help out an overburdened police department to stop a child kidnapper?  It seems totally unlike him.  <br />All of these quibbles are minor.  This is a very good book if you have read &quot;The Talisman&quot; and the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series.  I believe you will also like it if you have read one but not the other.	2002-08-15
US	52050206	R1HKBIRWHP7BXP	0312278586	244886090	The Nanny Diaries: A Novel	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Great Book, Easy Read	My wife and I picked up this book to read to each other a couple of weeks ago because of all the buzz.  We thought that it would give us something to do on the remainder of the lazy summer evenings when we had nothing else to do.  We wound up reading it almost every night for about a week, giving up social events and television, leaving us without a book to read together for the rest of the summer.<br />The Nanny Diaries is the fictionalized story of the two authors experiences as nannies in New York City.  The main character is named Nanny (or Nan).  The story focuses on a job she holds for nine months as the nanny for Grayer Addison X and, as a result of her peculiar employers an all-around servant (or, perhaps more descriptively a baby sitter) for Grayer's parents, Mr. and Mrs. X.<br />Many people think that the book is popular because it gives us a glimpse of the super rich of New York through the eyes of someone who is not one of them but is able to laugh at them.  I found the book to be so enjoyable for another reason:  Nanny is so sweet and devoted to her charge, Grayer.  Grayer is more spoiled than lots of kids, but he is also intelligent and in need of love.  It is heartwarming to see him get love from Grayer.<br />We also spend the entire book rooting for Nanny.  Rooting for her to get up the nerve to tell off Mr. and Mrs. X in the hopes that this will make them better parents.  Rooting for her to graduate and get a good job.  Rooting for her to get the boy of her dreams--one of the enjoyable side plots.  We do spend a decent amount of the time indulging our less charitable side by feeling superior to Mrs. X, but the goodheartedness of the book keeps this from happening all the time.<br />I would love to discuss all of the many crazy spots that Nanny gets into because of her employers; all the torments that Nanny has to bear while retaining her integrity and tenderness, but I enjoyed discovering all of these for myself, and I think it would be better for other readers to do so as well, so I will end here.	2002-08-14
US	52050206	R211ZJN5AGU4I4	0394720245	800538326	The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York	Books	5	20	21	N	N	A Beautiful and Thoroughly Researched Book	Perhaps the best way for me to recommend this book is to say that I had bought this 1100+-page book thinking that it would be my reading project for the next 6 months, and yet I finished it in about a month.  The pages fly by due to how interesting Caro's subject is, Caro's obviously thorough research and his great writing style--the combination of a journalist's ability to make one see events and a suspense writer's flare for the dramatic.  I was born and bred in Manhattan and Brooklyn, so it is possible that it's not be as easy a read for a non-native New Yorker, but I suspect that it would be.<br />The Power Broker is Robert Caro's opus about Robert Moses, New York City and its eastern suburbs on Long Island and, to a lesser degree, about New York State.  To call it a biography would not fully capture it.  One should pay attention to the second half subtitle explaining that the book is also about New York.  Caro diverges from his subject to spend chapters or parts thereof on other important figures to New York and Robert Moses, such as former New York governor and presidential candidate Al Smith or to the workings of New York City and State's government before Moses came to power.  <br />Caro gives the reader an amazing sense of what life was like in New York throughout the first two-thirds of the Twentieth Century and how Robert Moses changed and shaped the life of New Yorkers.  You will picture great public works such as parks, bridges, beaches and highways spring into being, you will feel the pain of people kicked out of their homes to make way for these edifices.  You will peek into legislatures and governor's mansions to see how they were delayed or speeded up, you will imagine the smoke-filled rooms of Tammany Hall where taxpayer money was passed between corrupt politicians with Robert Moses' help to make these works come to life.  And, of course, most of all, you will picture Moses striving to make all this happen and grasping for power.<br />I wish that this review could be completely positive.  I believe that Caro's writing style, research and his ability to translate the research into words deserves the 5 stars I gave this book, but I must say that I found some flaws in this book.<br />First, Caro paints Moses as a caricature.  That is not to say that Caro paints Moses as all evil or all good.  He explains several times that Moses did many great things for New York and many terrible things to it.  He also says that it is impossible to know whether New York would be better or worse without Moses.<br />However, the picture of Moses Caro gives us is one-dimensional.  He gives him three motivations for all his actions:  a love to build, a love of power and an arrogant intelligence.  With all due respect to Caro's thorough research, I can't believe that this is true.  Moses, like all of us, must have been motivated by many different things.  And yet, Caro hits us over the head with the same motivations over and over again in every chapter.<br />My second complaint is that, it seems to me that he ascribes much too much effect to Moses' causes.  In one of Caro's greatest chapters, he describes Moses' tearing the heart out of East Tremont in the Bronx, NY to build the Cross-Bronx Expressway.  He explains how Moses ruined the neighborhood without thought to its residents even though he could have built the highway in a much better location with almost no dislocation.  <br />However, Caro goes too far and says that the neighborhood would have remained stable for the foreseeable future without Moses.  Caro tries to explain why he believes that East Tremont would have survived.  But his explanation is weak.  It is probably impossible for him to explain how East Tremont, unlike its surrounding neighborhoods in the Bronx and unlike every other urban neighborhood of all ethnicities and all political stripes would not have succumbed to \\"white flight\\" as more Latinos and Blacks moved in.  Caro could have said, as he did, that Moses destroyed a neighborhood and left people homeless without trying to argue, unsuccessfully, that the neighborhood would have been fine without Robert Moses.<br />Everything said though, this is a great book that will give you insight into a man, a city, public works and the actions of powerful people.	2002-08-04
US	52050206	R2Z8X6Z0FABGAM	0312978367	931904718	The Prometheus Deception	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Action Packed and Relevant after 9/11	I bought this book to read on a transatlantic flight because I had read several Ludlum books earlier in my life and had thoroughly enjoyed them all but had then decided that I was &quot;too old&quot; for Ludlum books.  I realized my mistake almost as soon as I started reading.  Ludlum knows how to grab and keep a reader's intention throughout dozens of action scenes, one right after the next.  He is also a clear writer and I was able to follow the story even as characters popped into and out of the book at dizzying speed and the plot went through twists and turns.  With any other author, I would have needed a flowchart.<br />The plot, in a nutshell:  a super American agent, Nick Bryson, for an ultra-secret spy agency is sent into retirement unwillingly after failing to carry out a mission.  Several years later, the CIA show up at Bryson's door and tell him that he had unwittingly been working against America for all his years as an agent.  It turns out that the super secret spy agency was a secret to the entire U.S. government, and was, in fact, working for the Soviet Union.  The CIA sends him out to find out what his old bosses are up to now.<br />The plot twists and turns from there through global terrorism and corporate conspiracies, with Bryson surrounded by enemies almost all the time and putting his trust in friends that may soon become enemies.<br />The plot takes on new meaning after 9/11 because it involves the government (and in fact the whole world) taking away civil liberties because of terrorism.  The cause of the terrorism in the book is certainly different from that in real life and the reaction of the governments has certain been more even-handed then the reaction in the books.  But it does get us all to think about where the line should be between liberty and security.  So, if you pick up a Ludlum book (like I did) believing that there would be no deeper issues to think about, you should probably choose a different Ludlum book.  For me, this twist made the book a lot more interesting.	2002-07-03
US	52050206	RJQHZG371OX3K	074343627X	241269653	Dreamcatcher	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A Good Combination of Other King Books	Dreamcatcher is an alien invasion thriller. King, being a good writer, adds in other elements, and (of course) makes reference to happenings in other books--there is graffiti saying \\"Pennywise Lives\\" at one point in the book for the \\"It\\" fans.<br />Dreamcatcher tells the story of four friends who, as pre-teens/early teens, saved a Down's Syndrome kid, Duddits, from an attack by bullies. The friends remained in touch over the years, but lost touch with Duddits as they grew up. All four are now suffering from various adult maladies such as depression, loneliness, and alcoholism. <br />The four go hunting together and get caught by a blizzard and by invading aliens. They are also trapped in by psychotic army/government agents hunting the aliens and quarantining the area. The friends' are thrust into the role of protecting themselves, others in the quarantine, fighting off the aliens and saving the rest of the world. All of this makes for great pageturning, as you could only expect from King.<br />The book combines horror themes from several of King's earlier works in an enjoyable manner. The alien takeover of human bodies is very similar to the story King told in The Tommyknockers. The actions of the government are much like the government's actions in Firestarter or The Stand. The flashbacks between what the four friends did as kids and what they did today is similar to any number of King books, but perhaps closest to It in that they saved other children, with the exception that, unlike in almost all of King's other books, the kids were children in the late 70s rather than the 50s. Finally, much of the action involves people alone with their thoughts, with a monster, or at most with one companion. Thus, King is able to indulge in a lot of stream of consciousness, interior monologue writing. King is always a master of writing about people dealing with their own interior demons while trying to fend off outside monsters like in The Shining. He does it well here too.<br />My most major quibble is that King's characters always ring truest when they are average Americans, writers, or, of course, psychotics, the people King writes about best. His character development is not as good when his main characters are a psychiatrist and a history professor, as is the case here<br />All that said, I think that King's masterpiece of supernatural horror/thriller writing was \\"It\\" (unless you count the re-editing of \\"The Stand\\" as a new book). King clearly has moved on to other genres in his full-length novels, concentrating on fantasy in his Dark Tower series, human melodramas in books like Dolores Claiborne, The Green Mile, etc. <br />I believe that both he and his loyal readers feel nostalgic for his supernatural horror books, and this book was, hopefully, fun for him to write and fun for us to read for nostalgia. For new readers or readers who have read King books from other genres only, I would suggest reading some of his horror classics such as The Shining, Carrie, The Stand, It, etc. before reading this book. If you like all of those, you will like this one as well.	2002-05-13
US	52050206	R2VDMKDTZ6LVYR	0451196716	882393531	The Long Walk	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Depressing but Very Good	Stephen King wrote The Long Walk under his pseudonym Richard Bachman.  As Stephen King has said, Richard Bachman is Stephen King on a rainy day.  While most Stephen King books have happy themes intertwined with terror (his horror books) or other terrible circumstances (e.g., wrongful imprisonment as in Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption), Richard Bachman books are depressing all the way through.<br />In this book set in an alternate present, a group of one hundred teenage boys, including the hero, Ray Garraty, start out on a \\"long walk,\\" in which the winner gets money and a separate prize and all the rest of the walkers get a \\"ticket.\\"  The ticket, as many reviews have explained, and as you learn about 10 pages into the book (so it's not a spoiler) is a euphemism for a bullet or two in the brain.  The kids all have to walk at 4 miles per hour.  If a kid ducks below that pace, he gets a warning.  If he gets three warnings he gets shot.  However, if he can keep walking for an hour after he gets a warning, the warning is revoked.<br />As you can imagine, this book is really a 350 page exploration of pain, suicidal thoughts and how strong the will to live really is.  Since very few of us, outside of holocaust or Jim Jones survivors have experienced such a thing, it is a triumph of King's great writing that this all seems very real.<br />The book is very much centered on the long walk, the pain and the anguish.  Much of the book is about the transformation of good, bad, cynical, innocent, smart and dumb people under these extreme circumstances.  Nevertheless Garraty and many of the other walkers do talk about their lives before the walk with each other, and you get a glimpse of what life is like under this totalitarian government.  You also get two hints of why America has become such a horrible place that this is a prime sort of entertainment for America.  (perhaps there are more hints, I only caught two).  These hints were fascinating.  <br />The focus does remain on the long walk itself though, which distinguishes it from Running Man, the most similar King book (also \\"written\\" by Richard Bachman), which also is a book about a horrible life-and-death contest in America for sport in a country that has taken a wrong turn somewhere.  In Running Man, you get much more of a flavor of the surrounding world.  However, The Long Walk is just as interesting.<br />Only one flaw kept it from being a five star book (and it is a problem with many King books).  I was disappointed by the ending (which I will not spoil).  I think the ending is supposed to be a bit of a surprise.  However, rather than a surprise, it was something you would guess as a possible ending early on but hope it turned out differently.  <br />Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this book.	2002-04-05

The United States has now entered World War II.  Victor Henry is captaining a cruiser (and still taking part in world politics at a low but crucial level).  Warren is now fighting in the Battle of Midway as a fighter pilot.  Byron is a submarine officer.  Natalie and Aaron are now trapped in Nazi Europe with Natalie and Byron's infant and then young son.  <br />The focus of this book shifts from Victor (who still remains the glue that holds the family and the book together) to Natalie, Aaron and Byron.  Natalie and Aaron must deal with the horror of being American Jews caught in the Nazi web.  Their story is both harrowing and heartbreaking.<br />Over all, of course, the book continues to give a great feel for life during World War II, both for those who love history and for those who know nothing about the war.<br />One word of caution though:  As the title to this review suggests, you really must read The Winds of War before this book.  You won't be lost if you don't, but you won't understand the characters as much and may not become as attached to them.  For instance, it won't be as tragic to see Natalie indecisive with her baby in the face of the Nazis if you did not first see how strong and independent she was in the first book.<br />But go out and buy the Winds of War and read it (if you have not yet).  When you are finished, I can guarantee that you'll rush out and buy War and Remembrance and then be sorry that the story is over once you read the last page.	2002-04-05

It ends when America enters the war.  The sequel, War and Remembrance continues the story through the end of the war.<br />The main character, Victor Henry, a Commander in the United States Navy is sent to Germany just before the beginning of the war as a naval attache in the American embassy.  He is the gruff career military man with compassion and love just below the surface and easily recognized by anyone except his family.  His wife Rhoda is a Washington, DC socialite who was captivated by Victor but is now restless in her life as an officer's wife.<br />Victor and Rhoda have three children, Warren, the eldest who follows his father into the Navy and puts in for flight training, a daughter who is a less developed character and the aptly named Byron, a dreamer and a sensitive man who bridles under his father's influence and flees college to Siena, Italy, where he becomes an assistant to the American Jewish writer, Aaron Jastrow and falls in love with his daughter Natalie.<br />Victor Henry has something of Zelig in him and is a bit player in many important events of the time.  He attends a weekend retreat of high-ranking Nazis and has meetings with FDR.<br />Byron's employer Aaron Jastrow is a complex man, both running from his roots as a Yeshiva boy in Poland, and the product of those roots.  Natalie is a perfect picture of an American ex-pat woman living in Europe (first Paris than Italy) in the heyday of Americans living abroad.  And all of us can empathize with Byron, the young man who has not yet found his way in the world.<br />All these characters are set against the backdrop of the precursor to war and the beginning of the war.  For instance, one of the best sections of the book is an extremely harrowing but vivid section in which Byron, Natalie and Natalie's lover get stuck in Poland as the Nazis begin their occupation of that country.  <br />The fact that Wouk can seamlessly weave this web of characters into the tumultuous time in the late 1930s and early 1940s is a testament to a great author.  Indeed, I am writing this review at least 10 years after finishing the book, yet it is all vivid in my mind.<br />One final note that deserves mention:  Wouk treats us to several sections of a fictional book within a book.  After the war, Victor Henry translates a book by a German World War II general.  Wouk intersperses excerpts of this fictional book throughout the story, providing a seemingly totally realistic view from a German nationalist who fought for the Nazis (although was not a Nazi himself).<br />A must read for anyone who would describe himself or herself as any of the following:  (a) a history or historical fiction fan, (b) a fan of epic romance, (c) anyone interested in World War II, (d) anyone interested in the Navy.	2002-04-05

Of course, I always had a superficial understanding of how great they were and the sacrifices for which they volunteered, but now I have the evidence and emotional understanding to back it up.  I therefore recommend this book to every American.<br />Being an ignorant non-military type without the best memory in the world, I do have two very minor criticisms.  First, I think the book should have a glossary.  There are many abbreviations and other terms that are explained or defined once and then used throughout the rest of the book.  Unless you have a military background or an extraordinary memory, you will either find yourself flipping back through the book to try to find the meaning of different terms or, when you are in the middle of a gripping passage, simply trying to get the gist of the term from the rest of the passage.<br />Second, I wish the author had put a list of the main people in the book at the beginning or the end.  He does a pretty good job of adding a phrase to describe a person when he hasn't appeared for a while, like so and so, the Delta sergeant, or someone else, the leader of Chalk Two.  It probably would have been better to just give a brief description of each important soldier in one list so that the reader could refer to it whenever he or she wanted to do so.<br />Of course, both of these are minor quibbles.  The book was so interesting and well-written that these quibbles should not deter you from reading the book	2002-03-29

I was raised as a non-observant reformed Jew and believe that both Israel and Palestine should exist as countries. Don't know if that makes me unbiased or not.<br />To segue into the review, Friedman is definitely not unbiased. However, his main bias (at the time of writing, rather than now) is not pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian. It is pro a certain view of Israel. He believes that Israel should be a liberal, but religious state. This colors all of his statements about internal Israeli politics and makes his quotations from various politicians and citizens less reliable than you would expect.<br />On the other hand, the picture he paints of Lebanon is one of the most engaging and interesting sections of a recent history book I have ever read. Friedman has the unique ability to give the facts like a reporter, but tell the story like a fiction author.<br />His nuanced view of the Palestinians is quite interesting too. His view that the Israelis tried to coopt the Palestinians and that it almost work but the Palestinians finally demanded a \\"divorce\\" is quite original. His view that Palestinians do well in world opinion when they attack Israeli soldiers but not when they attack Israeli citizens is also quite perceptive. <br />I would definitely recommend this book as a starter for those interested in the Middle East, even though it is over a decade old.	2002-02-25
US	52050206	R2YJDI0NYWRSI2	1580631606	855950234	The Stephen King Universe	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Very Good, Watch Out for Spoilers	The authors do a great job of showing the links between the various Stephen King books and giving some insight into Stephen King's worlds.  Anyone who is a devoted Stephen King fan should have this book.  If you are a fan, you will have noticed that almost all King's books have connections to several other of King's works.  <br />This book will help you remember the links and will also be a helpful resource if you are reading a book King publishes in the future and you think there is a link to an earlier work but can't put your finger on it because this book also provides short synopses and descriptions of the main characters of every book, screenplay and published short story.<br />This book will also give you a clue about which Stephen King books you must read.  However, you have to be careful while reading about a book or story you haven't read yet.  This book tells the complete story, including the ending of all the King works.  Thus, if you think you might want to read a book after reading the first couple of paragraphs about the book, stop reading the chapter and buy the book.  Otherwise, the ending will be spoiled for you.<br />Finally, for fans of the Dark Tower series, even if they are not yet devoted King readers, or devoted readers of King's non-Dark Tower series this will be a very interesting book.  It will show you how King is connecting his works through the Dark Tower series and should get you interested in other King works.<br />And a postscript:  The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because of a couple of editing errors (e.g., in discussing It, the book mentions at one point that Mike Hanlon lives in Derry still and then at another point, mistakenly says that he lives in Nebraska--which is actually where Ben now lives).	2001-11-14
US	52050206	R33G6W8WIDRCNE	0670894508	256403279	Cause Celeb	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Entertaining and Thought-Provoking	On top of the fear discussed by previous reviewers that this book would be disappointing after Bridget Jones, I had an additional worry:  This is Fielding's first book.  So, why is it just now appearing in America?  The obvious answer is that this book was not very good but that the publisher, knowing that this book would sell well even if it was garbage due to the success of Bridget Jones, was just putting out a bad book to make money.<br />But, whether you had this fear or any other, you will enjoy this book if you (a) enjoyed Bridget Jones, (b) would find an honest account of celebrity hangers-on interesting and (c) want a unique, non-expert opinion on some of the poverty/political problems in Africa.<br />Cause Celeb tells, in two parallel story-lines, the story of a woman heading an sub-Saharan refugee camp just outside Sudan (here called Abouti) when a locust plague is about to hit the country and cause devastation to a population just now recovering from famine and the story of the messed-up Bridge Jones-style love affair that drove the woman away from her comfortable London life several years previously.  The last half of the book tells of the woman's plans to produce a Live-Aid style &quot;Appeal&quot; (British for benefit) to ward off the impending crisis.<br />First, for Bridget Jones lovers, the wit that will come to full bloom in Bridget Jones peeks out several times in this book providing a few laugh-out-loud moments.<br />Second, for those interested in celebrity, you get a seemingly honest view of what is like to run with famous people when you are not quite famous yourself.  For instance, you learn an interesting rule of being a celebrity hanger-on.  You are never allowed to start a conversation with someone more famous than you.  Always wait until they talk to you.  When the main character follows this rule, she is accepted; when she ignores it, she is shunned.  Never having been around celebrities, I can't vouch for its accuracy, but it does seemlike the world would work this way and is an interesting insight into celebrity.<br />Finally, hidden within the lightness of the book and the ridiculousness of some of the characters, a la Bridget Jones, is an unblinking look at political and poverty-created tragedy in Africa.  The book is a thinly-veiled indictment of the politics surrounding the Sudan civil war (and likely mirroring the problems of other immediately sub-Saharan nations), issues which are very current now as the U.S. and Western Europe debate whether to get involved in the Sudan and about which I, and I suspect most others, have very little knowledge.  This book gives detailed accounts of the horrors of famine which even the years of seeing starving children in Save the Children commercials has not immunized us from.  <br />However, the book is funny and cheerful enough for me to guarantee that those of you looking for diversion rather than depression in your reading material will still come away from the book happier than when you started, although you will, as I did, also have a greater appreciation for the problems surrounding African poverty by the end of the book.	2001-04-14

It is a must-read for anyone interested in history or Western civilization/thought and, so I have been told, for military strategists.  Given that it is the story of a war that took place over 2400 years ago, however, it is probably not for anyone looking for an interesting diversion from the workaday world.  For that, in the classical history genre, I would turn to Herodotus who provides a much more lively history, or for military history to Blackhawk Down, or for those interested in the grimmer parts of history, Daniel Judah Goldhagen's book on ordinary Germans' role in the holocaust and the glut of refuting books written in response.  Those are better page-turners, so to speak.<br />However, for those who are assigned to read Thucydides in a classroom or for those interested in the classical studies or the origins of Western Civ, you will not regret having read Thucyides.  Along with Herodotus' Histories, it is the foundation of modern historical writing and research (i.e., the telling of events from first hand knowledge or from original sources).  Both Herodotus and Thucyidides were not above making up speeches out of whole cloth, but the events that they recounted were all based on actual accounts (although Herodotus was more willing to recount seemingly fantastical tenth hand accounts and therefore can be seen as a bridge between the myth-telling of Homer and the more rigorous history of Thucydides).<br />As stated above, Thucydides does obviously make up some of the speeches, but given the recent controversy over the authorized biography of Ronald Reagan, it seems that some modern historians are also guilty of this and Thucydides did his work before academic standards were created to say that this shouldn't be done.<br />Along with an account of the actual events of the War which is most interesting to classicists and military historians (neither of which I am, so I will not comment further on this), Thucydides gives us timeless lessons in politics, the risks of relying on luck and international relations/diplomacy.  He also gives us his take on the dangers of too much democracy and mob rule (although he is likely biased on this issue since, although he was a general during the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians voted to banish him after one battle).<br />So, to some up, Thucydides History is not for the casual reader, but is an extremely interesting work and is a must-read for those interested in classical history.	2001-03-03
US	52050206	R1U5GJIBCCKDTS	0802132758	512368592	Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead	Books	4	143	153	N	N	Excellent on Several Levels	R&amp;G Are Dead has much to recommend it.  It is the story of two of the bit players from Hamlet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  If you haven't read or seen Hamlet, the book will probably not be of much interest, but, in a nutshell, R&amp;G are Hamlet's school chums who are called to Denmark by Hamlet's uncle, the King of Denmark, given the task of cheering him up and, when this fails, and the King realizes that Hamlet is a threat to his life, are given the task of sending Hamlet to his death.  Hamlet turns the tables on this plot and has R&amp;G killed instead.  <br />R&amp;G, although bit players, are actually in a surprising number of scenes (most of which are cut out from stage and film productions of Hamlet) and this play, interweaving these scenes with others, produces a rich picture of these two characters, entirely missing from Shakespeare's epic play.<br />The most obviously interesting part of this work is its attempt to explain why these characters die.  When you learn at the end of Hamlet that R&amp;G have died, you are left with a nagging sensation that something is wrong.  This play fleshes this out.  All of Shakespeare's tragedies are, by definition, bloody (as the Players in this work make evidently clear) but R&amp;G's deaths are not demanded by the plot or by the passions of any of the characters.  <br />We do not dwell on R&amp;G's deaths in Hamlet because more important and tragic events consume us.  This book makes us focus on the gratuitousness of R&amp;G's deaths.  In addition, it makes their deaths as tragic as those of the main characters in Hamlet by putting them the center of the story.  Of course, we do not get any real answers as to why these characters die.  Other than by changing the story of Hamlet, there can be no answer to this question.  However, simply dwelling for a longer time on these characters' fate at least gives their deaths importance, if not meaning.<br />On another level, this book deals with themes of fate and luck.  R&amp;G have been swept up in events beyond their understanding and/or control.  This book takes a philosophical approach to these issues (and definitely is reminiscent of Waiting For Godot).  Since we can all identify with this to some extent, R&amp;G's deaths become compelling and as tragic as Hamlet's death.<br />Finally, much of this work is comedic.  R&amp;G do provide comic relief at various points in Hamlet, so this play does well to play up the comedic aspects of their lives.  Even if you have no interest in the deeper meanings of this work, you will enjoy it for the comedy.	2001-02-17

In this book, McCourt recounts the story of his early adulthood. Although interesting, 'Tis falls well below the high standard McCourt set in Angela's Ashes.<br />The book does have its good points. It gives a vivid and likely very accurate portrayal of post-war immigrant life in New York and provides interesting insights into the life of a new teacher in the New York public school system at a time in which the school system was going through great changes.<br />Unfortuately, the main problem with the book is that McCourt employs exactly the same style of writing as he does in his first book. He writes as an optimistic innocent viewing a harsh world through naive but endearing eyes. Unfortunately, this style which was so charming and seemingly true-to-life when McCourt was recounting his experiences as a young boy and teenager rings hollow when McCourt is a 30-something college graduate teaching high school. Either McCourt's life experiences had no effect on him (unlikely, given the riches of those experiences) or McCourt did not take the time in writing 'Tis to delve into his life experiences to produce a more accurate account of his adult life. It would have been more risky for McCourt to change his writing from the award-winning style McCourt employed in Angela's Ashes, but it would have made for a much better book.<br />If McCourt chooses to write another sequel, I hope he first takes some time for introspection and realizes that, since he is not the same person he was as a young child, he should find a new voice to narrate his later life experiences.	2001-02-02

His story is one of incredible sadness.  His father spends the family's mother on drink, several of his siblings die in early childhood and he grows up in desperate poverty in Ireland.  Nevertheless, Angela's Ashes is an extremely optimistic and light-hearted book.  As a child, McCourt has the outlook of a Tom Sawyer, looking at every hardship as an adventure while retaining the love for his family that Tom Sawyer never had.<br />McCourt loves his alcoholic father for sharing Irish patriotism with him, loves his mother for caring for him through such difficult times and clearly was a good older brother to his siblings.  Despite the great love for his family, McCourt is also a rebel, ignoring arbitrary rules set by his parents, his teachers and his priests while never harming those he loves by his rebellion.<br />Angela's Ashes has the rare ability to remind us of our good fortune without seeming preachy.  The lesson of Angela's Ashes is not &quot;be happy for having such a good life because others have it worse off&quot; but rather is &quot;no matter what adversity you face, life is a wonderful thing.&quot;  This is truly a wonderful lesson and will uplift you while reading this book.	2001-02-02

In this book, the twin children of Paul Maud'Dib Atreides,  hero of the first two books of the series must contend with the continued  upheaval in the galaxy caused by their father's violent ascent to the  imperial throne.  <br />The background for this book is complex:  The fallout  from Paul's takeover is massive.  Paul's ascent to the throne, while  possibly the least evil course for humanity given the corruption and  stagnation in the human race until his takeover, unleashed a bloody jihad  on the galaxy.  Paul's original followers, the desert-bred and half wild  Fremen have become the leaders of the jihad.  As army officers, they are  still great warriors; however, they have lost much of their mysticism and  their wildness.  As a result, some of the Fremen have turned against Paul,  as originally explored in the previous book, Dune Messiah.  On top of this,  Paul's death in the previous book has left only his two young children to  rule.  Given their youth, the galaxy is being run in their name by their  increasingly corrupt and insane aunt, the Abomination Alia, possibly in  league with their grandmother who may also be a traitor to them and their  step-mother Irulan.<br />As a result of all this, the book focuses on the  children's attempts to take control of the empire and save it from those  who will destroy the entire galaxy.  Furthermore, they must find a way to  take control of the empire while avoiding the mistakes of their father,  Paul, who unleashed the violent jihad on the galaxy, allowed himself to be  set up as a Messiah and became so addicted to the Spice melange which  allowed him to see the future that he became unable to act except as  dictated by his visions.<br />The children strike on a horrifying method to  take over the galaxy but avoid the temptation of doing so by foreseeingthe  future exactly.  I will not reveal their method because one of the best  parts of the book is the way their method unfolds, twisting and turning  until the final horror is revealed.  The book is worth reading just to have  that revelation.<br />Another interesting aspect of this book is the fact that  for the only time in the Dune series, Herbert's main characters are young  children.  Although they have collected wisdom greater than anyone else in  the galaxy, except possibly their aunt Alia due to their parentage, Herbert  is still able to deal with them as children.  Herbert shows his deftness as  an author, not simply as a sci-fi writer.<br />The only flaw with this book is  that it is significantly less mystical than the prior books.  Although the  result of the path chosen by the children is very mystical, as revealed in  the next book, this book primarily deals with plot rather than Herbert's  amazing insights into humanity and religion.	2000-06-03

This book picks up soon after the end of the first book.  Paul Maud'Dib Atreides, main character in the first book and now emperor of the galaxy, has to deal  with the results of the jihad he reluctantly released on the galaxy as well  as the threats to his power from within his own palace.  This book is more  introspective than the first book, lacking most of the action and focusing  instead on the foibles of the various characters and Herbert's musings on  religion and politics.<br />This book makes even more clear than the first  book that Paul is not actually a hero, but a flawed man trying to cope with  the enormity of his own power and the terrible bloodshed that is being  committed in his name.  The book is an essay on the dangers of absolute  power and of the combination of religious and political power.<br />Dune  Messiah is also a story of the danger of a ruler becoming disaffected from  those closest to him.  The greatest danger to Paul comes from his  disaffected wife.  Paul also cuts off his beloved concubine from his  decision-making and instead chooses a course which leads him towards  personal destruction to save the galaxy.  Perhaps Herbert's real message  here is that domestic bliss is the key to happiness even for the  all-powerful.<br />Although this book is interesting, it is mainly filler  between the masterpiece of Dune and the very good Children of Dune.	2000-06-01
US	52050206	RGXY30P1VWTDJ	0441172717	88529599	Dune	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A Powerful Beginning To One of the Best Sci-fi Series	Dune is Frank Herbert's masterpiece about Paul Maud'Dib Atreides, descendants of the House Atreus of Homeric fame, and his battles with his arch-enemies, the Harkonnens and, eventually, with the combined forces of  the galaxy.  The first of six books in an unfinished series--Herbert died  before he brought his series to a conclusion--this book is the best of the  series.<br />Set far in the future, after humanity has not only left Earth,  but humanity's origin is probably forgotten, the setting for this book is a  neo-medieval world of strict castes, nobility and civilized warfare.  The  basic plot is rather standard:  the young hero, Paul must come of age  quickly when his father is treacherously killed by agents of the hated  rivals.  Since Paul loses his rightful throne, he must come of age among  the violent indigenous population known as the Fremen.<br />Although Herbert  does write the action scenes well, the plot is not the strong suit of the  book--later books in the series have better plots.  The strongest part of  the book is the theme of religion and politics that runs through the book.   Herbert combines many different religions in this future galaxy including  Christianity, Islam and various eastern religions.  <br />Herbert sets his  hero, Paul, up as a messiah to the planetary population, the Fremen and  possibly to the entire galaxy.  This path may ultimately lead to a bloody  jihad.  However, Paul realizes that being a messiah is a dangerous path to  take, ultimately ruinous to humanity as later books show.  However, Paul's  desire for power and the evilness of the alternate leaders, the corrupted  by power emperor, the overly secretive female priesthood named the Bene  Geserit, the no longer human Guild, and the entirely evil Harkonnens force  Paul at every fork in the road to choose the path that leads to his  anointing as messiah.  Herbert thus creates a hero who is not as virtuous  as he seems at first glance.  <br />A final note:  as with any good first book  in a sci-fi/fantasy series, there is much that remains unexplained in this  book.  Anyone who says that they understand the entire book is either lying  or missed something.  Some of the mysteries in this book become explained  in later books, and one--the reference to Richese--in the prequel recently  co-written by Herbert's son.  There is also a great deal of mysticism and  musing on the general state of humanity, some of which was, frankly, over  my head.  <br />Therefore, if mysticism and unexplained mystery are not your  cup of tea, then you should skip this book.	2000-06-01

The conclusion of the mad monorail story is suspenseful and  exciting.  The continued insights into Roland's world and the connection to  ours is as interesting as ever.  The confrontation between Roland and the  forces of Randall Flagg, the arch-villain in Steven King's classic, The  Stand, is also well-done and King shows again that he is a great action  writer.<br />Unfortunately, the main part of the book, a love story between a  young Roland and a fair maiden, Susan Delgado, is possibly the weakest  element of the Dark Tower saga to date.  Love stories are not King's strong  suit.  In addition, King tells us in his introduction that he began writing  the story of Roland's youth while working on an earlier volume in the  series but cut it out when he got stuck at a certain point.  Perhaps the  time between starting the story and finishing it hurt the story.<br />On the  whole, however, this is still a good book and set us up well for the  concluding volume(s) which King promises are forthcoming.  Therefore, I  recommend reading this book despite the weakness of the love story.	2000-05-31

It is long on atmosphere and  short on action.  Therefore, fans of Steven King's horror works will find  this book a distinct change of pace.  However, the book will not disappoint  you if you try it, especially if you are a fan of fantasy series such as  the Lord of the Rings.  Furthermore, you will find in later books that  elements of King's horror world also exist in Roland's world, and  therefore, to have a full understanding of King's horror villains, you have  to read this series.<br />The Gunslinger offers several intriguing views of  Roland's dying world.  The book is not devoid of action; there is a  dramatic shoot out for shadowy reasons which one hopes will be better  explained in the concluding volumes of the work.  There is a lost child who  provides the first direct evidence that Roland's world is connected to our  own, and there is the introduction to Roland himself, a man who is capable  of fantastic violence but still comes across as human and quite possibly  kind (a fact which becomes more clear in later books).  <br />I recommend this  book most highly to anyone who enjoys stories involving quests such as  Arthurian legends, the Chronicles of Prydain and the Hobbit and Lord of the  Rings.	2000-05-31

The term &quot;drawing&quot; refers to the act of  taking people from our world to Roland's dying world.  Roland does not get  to choose which people to &quot;draw&quot;, but rather must draw the people  chosen for him in an unknown manner.  Unlike the other three installments  in this series, we do not learn much about Roland's world in this book, a  disappointment given how interesting Roland's world is and how good King is  at describing that world.  Instead, we get to see our world through  Roland's eyes.  Since Roland's world is, in many ways, a medieval world,  his view is akin to the one we would get from a time traveler from several  centuries ago.  For example, Roland is particularly taken by a pharmacy in  which the potions and elixirs non-existent or rare in his world are  casually sold with a doctor's note in our world.<br />Since the process of  drawing also requires Roland to enter the minds of the people he draws, we  gain unique insight for a book written in third person into the minds of  Roland's companions which aids us in understanding the characters in later  volumes.  Furthermore, this allows King to engage in something akin to  stream of consciousness as we see into the minds of Roland's companions.   Although King is, of course, no Faulkner, it should be noted that two of  the characters Roland enters are mentally disturbed and therefore, as in  The Sound and the Fury, King competently describes the thoughts of  characters with minds totally alien from our own.<br />Finally, for those who  are fans of action and therefore were not enamoured by The Gunslinger, this  book will not disappoint you.  This book is chock full of action, including  shoot outs with cops, races against time to save characters from death and  eerie, intelligent animals called lobstrosities who are almost as scary as  some of King's evil characters in his horror books.  Thus, even if you  disliked The Gunslinger, read this book.  You might even decide to re-read  The Gunslinger after this book gets you excited by the series.	2000-05-31

In previous books,  Roland met three people from our world, two of whom accompanied him on his  quest.  <br />This installment includes three important separate stories:  (1)  the &quot;drawing&quot; of  one more person from Earth, the child Jake whom  we first met in the introductory book in this series; (2) the companions'  travails in the city that lies in the path of their quest; and (3) the  beginning of the companions' encounter with the mad monorail.  Each of  these stories is compelling in its own right, although I do not suggest  reading this book before reading the previous two because, although you  would be entertained and intrigued by King's alternate world, you would be  missing the full story.  <br />Along with the interesting plots, we also learn  much more about Roland's world.  Part of this new knowledge comes from the  tales Roland tells his companions, but much more is a by-product of the  plot.  We learn more about how the world has changed from Roland's youth,  and we are treated to an imaginative post-apocalyptic vision of a city  ruled by gangs whose original rivalry was rooted in a generation gap.  King  treats us as visitors to this world in much the same way that Roland's  companions are.  Rather than explain every little detail as it comes up, he  prefers to let us discover the world as if we were really visiting  it.<br />Finally, King makes even more explicit the fact to which he alluded  in earlier volumes that the villains in Roland's world are the same  villains patrolling our world in Steven King books.  In his other works,  King usually drops a reference to other books he has written--e.g., several  of his books allude to the dog who ran amok in Cujo.  In theDark Tower  series, however, rather than making oblique references to other books, King  has made it clear that the boogie men from other books inhabit this world  as well.  Fans of King's horror works should, therefore, also read this  series in order to learn more about what King thinks of his villains.	2000-05-31

The Hannibal Lechter series worked in the first few books in large part because of the incredibly frightening thought that an extraordinarily intelligent, witty, well-educated professional is also, inexplicably, a monster of unspeakable proportions. In this book, Harris is turned into a run-of-the-mill maniac whose past explains his present actions. Instead of the psychological fear we had of Lechter, the only scary things in this book is the violence wrought by Hannibal. <br />This is even more unforgivable because Harris shows us how wonderful a writer he can be when he describes Hannibal's intelligence, as opposed to his insanity. The description of Hannibal's intelligence is beautiful, imaginative and intriguing, while the description of how Hannibal became insane is dull. <br />Which brings us to my last criticism: the book as a whole is boring. Although the violence scenes are well-written, the main plot, having to do with the search for Hannibal by the Clarisse and the authorities and by a former victim of Hannibal bent on revenge is uninteresting and shows off none of Harris's considerable abilities as a writer. Finally, because of Harris's decision to devote so much time to the horrible ending involving Clarisse's startling metamorphosis, Harris gives short shrift to the plot, having it come to a climax before the plot even has a chance to become interesting. Therefore, I suggest you skip this book and hope that Harris's next book is better.	2000-05-30
US	52050206	R3U6OWUWHBZGFZ	0321012542	420218883	The Complete Works of Shakespeare (4th Edition)	Books	5	35	36	N	N	A Well Done Edition	David Bevington gives us a well-researched and useful edition of William Shakespeare's complete works.  The bard's plays are, of course, indescribably good, and would be in any edition.  Thus, an editor's job is  to provide annotations to explain archaic vocabulary or 16th Century  references which would otherwise escape us, to give the reader the best  text available--since Shakespeare's plays were originally not written for  publication but only for production on the stage, this is a recurring  problem--to write short introductions to plays which guide a reader about  certain themes recurring in the play, and to provide other helpful material  in a general introduction and in end notes.  Bevington succeeds at all  these tasks.  His annotations are, as a rule, helpful without being  intrusive.  Bevington seems instinctively to know when a word or phrase  needs to be explained and when a description of a phrase not immediately  obvious to modern readers would be more harmful than helpful by breaking up  the flow of the text.  His introductions to each play are insightful.  A  good example of this is Bevington's introduction to Much Ado About Nothing  in which he explains that the Sixteenth Century pronunciation of  &quot;Nothing&quot; was the same as the pronunciation of  &quot;Noting.&quot;  Since the play involves numerous instances of people  overhearing other character's conversations, the play's title has a double  meaning--i.e., it is both Much Ado About Nothing and Much Ado About Noting.  Finally, Bevington's introductory and concluding general remarks are also  quite good.  For example, Bevington gives brief descriptions of the  Elizabethan stage and the history of Shakespearean productions over the  last four hundred years in his introduction. He also gives his take on the  controversy over whether Shakespeare wrote all his plays himself. After the  plays, he gives the sources of the text for the various plays, including  how the plays were first published..	2000-05-30

Even though the play deals with so many complex issues, it is  eminently readable, one might even say a page-turner.  A final note of  interest:  the playwright tells us in his introduction that the plot of the  play came from a newspaper headline he saw describing a particularly  bizarre crime.  Although the author never learned anything more about the  crime, the headline sparked his imagination.  The play, therefore, also  serves as an intriguing study of the playwright's own imagination.	2000-05-30
