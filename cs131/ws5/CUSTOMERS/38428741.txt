My job involves so much study and reading that I seldom have time to sit down and read anything that is not work-related. I listen to novels while driving, shopping, exercising, etc. But I'd heard so many good things about this one that I went ahead and bought it and read all 640 pages. <br /> <br />I could hardly put it down. Yes, it's long, but I found that much of the description and history presented added to the story and was interesting. This is certainly an unusal book. If you have the patience for it, I'd say that you will definitely be rewarded for taking the time to read it.	2005-08-24

I've listened to both of Richard Rhodes' excellent books, but they end with the development of the bombs. This chronicles a broader history. I found it readable and fascinating. It's just what I've been waiting for.    I'm not going to quibble over the difference between \\"hitting\\" a hospital or exploding 1600 feet directly above it--the effect is the same. This is written by a Briton, but he is definitely not a unilateral disarmament lefty. He makes no judgement about whether it was right or wrong to use the bomb on Japan. I suspect that he, like I do, believes that it was simply inevitable.    If you want a concise, readable, and informative history of nuclear weapons, you will be pleased with this book.	2005-08-24

On p23, it correctly states that CV2 went down in the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942. They later correctly state that the Essex class carrier scheduled to be named Cabot was renamed Lexington (CV16), commissioned in 1943. The writer must have seen a picture of CV16 from 1944, seen that it looked different than CV2 and written that it was upgraded.    Bad job. Go ahead and get the book if you want the pictures, but find another title as a companion to get accurate history.	2005-04-16

I've been waiting for this book for well over a year. So glad it's finally here! It is an excellent companion to Scott Michael's \\"Marine Fishes\\" handbook. It's a handy, easily carried reference to take to the LFS or use in planning. The key info is there. The pix are nice enough. I think that coral fans would be best off with a separate corals book. As a big fan of echinoderms, I would have preferred a broader selection of these. You cannot rely on this book to identify all but the very most common stars. I have 3 seastars and several serpent/brittle stars in my tanks that are not pictured here. <br /> <br />I also had to chuckle at his deadpan wit. Regarding the Blue-Ringed Octopus: \\"The rewards of octopus husbandry can be had without selecting one that can kill you.\\" Regarding Fish-Eating Cone Snails: \\"If you are stung by one of these snails, there is a very good chance you will die.\\"	2005-04-16

Modern cinema is most decidedly not \\"our greatest art form.\\" Sheesh! Most of what comes out of Hollywood these days is mindless pap. That's not to say that a lot of it is not entertaining. Even some of the stupid stuff entertains some Friday nights after a long week's work. There are still even a few great films out there, and Roeper acknowledges this.  <br /> <br />Guess what, critics are supposed to be critical, not sycophantic. I enjoyed the sarcastic wit of this book a lot more than I enjoyed some of the movies I've seen.	2005-03-11

For nearly 20 years of my adult life, I was a faithful, church-going, tithe-paying, temple-attending, calling-fulfilling member. I gradually came to realize that the LDS Church is just another mind-controlling power institution foisted upon the masses by a bunch of men who enjoy telling other people how to live their lives. I still live in Utah, but have not been the least bit involved for 8 years now. Therefore, I agree with quite a bit of what the author has written about the church.    On the other hand, I have studied \\"repressed memory\\" enough to realize that it is mostly bunk foisted upon the masses by some foolish and many unscrupulous therapists who also like to tell other people how to live their lives. (There's far too many people like this in the world.) Therefore, I am strongly disinclined to  believe that Hugh Nibley sexually abused his daughter, the author. I do think that she sincerely believes that he did, and she does present physical evidence as well as some other things that suggest this may be true. So maybe it did happen, who knows?     She also makes a number of misstatements that reflect lack if interest in accuracy of details. For example, she talks about a polygamist who came to her home. She says he had 4 wives and that shortly after the visit he blew his brains out and the wives threw their kids off of an SLC building and then jumped. This is simply not true. The man, who called himself Immanuel David, did claim to be God, but he was not a polygamist. He killed himself by carbon monoxide poisoning in his car in a Utah canyon in 1978. His only wife then threw their 7 children out of an 11th floor hotel window in SLC and jumped. The oldest child, then 15, survived with severe brain damange.    Still, the book does a pretty good job of detailing how the Church intimidates and silences internal critics through its \\"Strenthening the Members Committee,\\" an operation that the CIA would do well to emulate. For a more fair and accurate criticism of the LDS Church, I highly recommend \\"One Nation Under Gods\\" by Richard Abanes instead.	2005-03-11

Haven't we all wondered what we'd do differently if we could go back an re-live our lives from some past point with our current knowledge intact? This book shows that it might not be such a great thing--we might not be able to change as much as we hoped and we might not do much better with our lives than we did the first time around. Simply put, this is a fantastic book that I highly recommend. It cost me a lot of sleep because I could not put it down.	2005-02-18

It certainly has a lot of images that makes one wish we could find a way to bring a stop to all of this horror, but this century is not off to a good start either. <br /> <br />I do wonder about the accuracy of this book after discovering an error. The picture on page 421 that purports to be of Nazis executing people somewhere in the baltic in 1942 is actually a picture of Nazi war criminals being executed in Poland in 1946. One wonders how many other pictures are mislabeled.	2005-01-29

It is probably the most complete taxonomic encyclopedia of stony corals in existence. The pictures are beautiful and the information fascinating. That said, this is not for your basic reef aquarist. It covers only the stony corals of the order scleractinia. There is nothing here about zoanthids, corallimorphs or the various other soft corals. If you want a great book about common aquarium corals, I would strongly recommed Eric Borneman's &quot;Aquarium Corals&quot; or Fossa &amp; Nilsen's &quot;The Modern Coral Reef Aquarium, Volume 2.&quot; If you have a deep fascination for stonys and are OK spending $160, this set is for you.	2003-10-31

There are lots of great pictures. The book is an excellent resource for those who are starting a reef tank. There are thorough and informative chapters on issues such as set-up, live rock, lighting, fitration, feeding, etc. The sections on selection &amp; care of corals, other invertebrates, fishes, and algae are excellent. Issues of care, compatibility and conservation are addressed for all species.<br />I did notice a couple of incorrect pictures, but this is a very minor problem.<br />Overall, this is an excellent beginner/intermediate book by a pair of recognized and respected authorities in the field. Their superb 4-volume series is beyond the budget of most at a per-volume list price of around $90. Most of what the average new reefer needs is here in this book. It is an excellent value for the price.	2003-10-12

I enjoyed reading about the different ways people have succeeded with marine aquaria. We can learn a lot from each other. I sure would love to have access to the 20,000 gallon system described in this book.<br />I do have a couple of issues:<br />1. This is strictly an American book. Almost all of these tanks are in the USA. More tanks from other countries would have been interesting.<br />2. The info is rather old for a book just published in 2003. Much of the info is 3 years old or older and some of the tanks were quite young at the time. I'd love to learn how some of these tanks fared later. There was one small tank in particular that was ridiculously overstocked with fish that are not reef safe (most notably several triggers). It was only a few months old. I'll bet it has long since crashed.	2003-09-27

Well, everbody knows that insects are arthropods. At 900,000+ species, insects are the largest class of arthropods and crustaceans are but a small fraction.
