Jenkins, you must read the first ten in the series. The series begins with Left Behind. It starts when all the devote Christians vanish. Rayford Steele, the main character, lost his wife, Irene, and his son, Raymie. He only has his daughter Chloe left. <br /> When everybody disappeared, Ray was a pilot on a plane. Hattie Durham, a flight attendant on the plane, was the person Ray was going to cheat on his wife with. Cameron \\"Buck\\" Williams, the second main character, is a senior writer for a New York magazine. Eventually, Ray, Buck, Chloe, and Bruce meet. Bruce is the new pastor at a church because the old one vanished. They all become Christians and form the Tribulation Force. More and more people join the Tribulation Forces while Nicholae Carpathia takes over the globe, without any disputes, as the devil. Some Christians die, while others become Christians. Just in the book Armageddon, two original members die, one other member dies, and another original member gets seriously injured. A lot happens in this series. Three couples get married and one couple has a child <br /> I pretty much liked everything in this series. The only part I don't like is when the characters are waiting for some reason and the way they switch milieus all the time. On one page you could be reading about Ray flying a plane, then it goes to Bruce preaching a sermon. It all makes perfect sense, though. I don't think this book is similar to anything I have previously read. I really, really suggest this book to everyone. <br />	2005-05-16

For the Amazon Reading project I read the book Armando's Treasure by Melody Carlson. This book is a very good book if you're into slight mystery. I would rate this book four stars, it was interesting but not totally mind blowing. It's about a Hispanic boy named Armando Garcia who has ran away from his home in L.A. He arrives in a little town called Treasure and is attracted by an old pick up truck that was a little rusty but it was better than his own two feet. As he was checking out the car the little old lady named Dora Chase that owns the truck and the property he was on came out with a shot gun threatening to shot. Armando gently calmed down the lady convincing her that he met no harm. Dora has a broken arm and was in very much pain so Armando took her into her own house and gave her a pain reliever pill. As him and Dora were talking Dora's son came over and started yelling at Armando to get out of their house. Charlie (Dora's son) wanted Dora to sell her land to a factory, but Dora wouldn't because it used to be her husbands before he died and he gave everything to get the little farm working. Throughout, the story Armando meets Dora's grandchild Olivia, who is a very pretty girl, that Armando instantly falls in love with, but Olivia has a bad habit of smoking and drinking and also has a boyfriend that is an artist. Armando stays around the house to help out Dora incase her son tried to steal the property again. While helping out he makes himself at home and starts getting the farm running again, piece by piece. He builds Dora a pond and puts fish and plants all around and in it. Charlie was so furious at Armando that he looked up history on him and found out that he was wanted for possession of half a million pounds of cocaine which is the reason he ran away from home. Before Armando can get into trouble he takes off and starts heading back home but Olivia chases him down. Did Armando really commit a crime? What happens to him and Olivia? And then again what happens to the little farm that Armando was trying to get started again? You'll just have to read the book to get the answer. <br /> Some things I liked about this story was that it was an easy to read book even though it was a thicker one, also it I also liked how it had such a good moral and it really made you think about things in your life and how much you take for granted. Some things I didn't like about this book was how it took so long to actually get going, in the beginning it got into really great detail that wasn't to interesting to read about. <br /> Armando treasure wasn't like any other book I've read it had it's own little version of life and the way things work which is another thing I liked about it , how it didn't base itself off any other book.   <br />	2005-05-16

Since Coach Rake isn't around to talk, he has to make his decision based on his past experiences from when Neely was the star quarterback, and a few of those experiences are rather interesting.  The book is full of stories from Neely's playing days. <br /> I really liked this book.  It was full of action stories from the gridiron, some from Neely's days, some older, but all from the Rake Era.  It is a great sports book, especially if you like football. <br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good sports book.

It went right along with the first novel, picking up on details and bringing them back into the sequel.  The series is very down to earth.

This book was written by Will Hobbs, who's also written Down the Yukon, Jason's Gold, The Maze, Ghost Canoe, and Far North. The story is about a boy who's father was an archeologist. Years ago Andy's father was on a trip in Alaska trying to find evidence of the firs people in north America. He was with another person but he slipped and fell. Now Andy was in Alaska looking for the Island that this father had died on. He's on a kayaking trip with a group of people but during a storm Andy is swept way off course and lands on what seems to be a deserted island. Until he sees a mysterious man with wild looking beard and dressed in bark and animal skins. Andy decides to find out who the man really is while trying to survive wind, rain, and mind numbing cold, along with the local grizzly bears. <br /> One of the strong points of this book is the suspense. There's always twisted that keep you reading and wanting to find out what happens next. The book also seems really realistic. Will Hobbs seems to know a lot about the outdoors and surviving and you can tell in the way he writes this book. I've never read any of his other books but after this one I think that I would enjoy another of his books. <br /> There was one thing that I didn't like about this book was that there wasn't really a whole lot of action. There was plenty of suspense, like I said before but the suspense was more from the plot and not from something that is physically happening to Andy. He never really gets in any fights or any action like that. Otherwise this book was great and I would recommend it to anyone who likes outdoors books. <br />	2005-04-18

That is, until a punk chick Geretrude tells him an astounding secret that will change his life forever. In this romance/suspenseful book, Jed goes through a test of bravery, trust, secrets, and love that will teach him what life is really about.  <br /> One thing I liked about this book was that it really showed how much reality is really in everyone's life. It shows that no matter how great everything is going for you, it can be just as easily destroyed in the amount of time it took to build it up. A couple of things that I didn't like about this book was that it was hard to get into in the beginning. It just kept on going on and on about things that didn't matter in the plot. I also didn't like the ending of the book because it made no closer to the problem in the book. <br /> This book is similar to no other book I've ever read. <br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action, suspense, and somewhat romantic books. This book can be for a boy or girl. <br />	2005-02-22

On her journey, she meets tiny blue men named the Wee Free Men who are Scottish men addicted to drinking, cursing, and fighting. Along the way, they seem to protect Tiffany from ferocious dogs and other magical things. Finally at the end of the book, she meets the Queen, but there is a little problem. Find out if the Queen can negotiate with Tiffany to get her little brother back. <br />What I liked about this book is that the author chose creative names for his characters. Also, I liked the way the Wee Free Men spoke among one another. What I didn't like is the entire story plot.  <br />If you enjoy Tinkerbell with Harry Potter and a touch of Braveheart, then you'll be able to relate this to another story. Other than that, I don't recommend this to anyone. <br />	2005-02-22

Everyone is very worried about it because it happened only 50 miles away. Could it happen at Central (toms school)? This is exactly what his school doesn't want to happen, so they hire a guidance counselor named Mr. Wilner. This seems like no big deal until he starts making strict rules all the students need to follow. There are now metal detectors and safety guards. Things, in the students eyes, seem to be getting out of hand. And the parents? They are getting e-mails from the school which are somehow brainwashing them. Worst of all, anyone who disobeys these ridiculous rules will be sent to a camp. 3 kids have already been sent, 2 of them are Tom's friends. Will he be next?   <br /> I think the book had a great theme. Although the beginning was very slow. It's a long read for when you can't think of something to do. <br />	2004-10-29

Anther thing I liked about this book is that it shows the  struggle of a geeky foreign kid getting pushed around.<br /><br /> Things I didn't like about this was that they had some Asian words in it.

If that isn't bad enough, he thinks that his dad is trying to kill him.  This book will keep you reading until the very last page.  Some things I liked about the book that is was told in his perspective.  I think that it is cool because I never thought about how kids with that disorder could be a normal kid with a normal mind.  Another thing is that he tells the story like you are right there with him.  Also, the book isn't depressing at all like you might think.  Sometimes it's funny, too.  The only part of the book that I didn't like was a part at the end. I don't think it was as good as it should have been.  Because of this, I gave this book four starts.	2004-10-29

Once Charlie is at school, he receives a mysterious box from a bookkeeper that has clues to someone else's past.  Charlie spends his whole school year trying to figure out what the box really means. <br /> Some things I liked about the book was that it had a touch of fantasy about it.  Some kids in the book had special powers.  Some could fly or even hypnotize people.  Another thing I liked about the book was that it was very suspenseful at the end.  Charlie almost figures out what the box really means when something bad happens.   <br /> Some of the things I did not like about the book is that it started out very slow.  It wasn't until maybe the middle of the book that it started picking up.  To tell the truth, I almost wanted to stop reading it because it wasn't very exciting in the beginning.  The beginning actually sets the pace for the end.  That is really the only thing I didn't like about the book. <br />	2004-10-29

Every time a new book comes out I'm always the first person to get it in the library. To understand this book you might have to read the two books before this one to figure out about why he is where he is in this book. This book is about Brian and he is camping and he sees a dog. The dog is wounded and he is having trouble getting up. Brian goes over to see what is wrong and he sees that the dog is hurt. Now Brain is going to hunt for the person or thing that has hurt this dog. The dog also comes with him as his new partner to hunt. Some things that I like about this book is that it is very adventurous. It has a lot of things about what to doing the wilderness when you are camping and something goes wrong. Overall I think that you will love this book about Brian's Hunt.	2004-10-29

It also talks about a bunch of good football players and how they got into the football business. Some of the reasons I liked this book is because it has a big chapter about one of the best halfbacks Emitte Smith, and the reason I liked that part of the book is because I really like Emitte Smith there for I liked reading and leaning about him. But with all the good things they were a couple things that I did not like. Some of the things I did not like are it left out a lot of the great football legends Like OJ Simpson, Joe Namath, Bart Star and, Barry Sanders. The reason that made me not like it is because they are football players I really liked and wanted to learn about so that made me made. That is my likes and dislikes of the book.	2004-10-29

She faces many problems like boys, French class, Rodeo Days, a job, and dealing with her mother's pregnancy. In the small town though, she doesn't have a lot of things to do in her spare time. All the adventures and daily problems she goes through makes for an excellent book full of drama with some comedy. <BR> The part I liked about this book was how I could relate to the main character in many ways. Being a teenager from a small town like she was, I could understand jokes and remarks she'd make. Also the imagery was well described so you can easily get a picture in your head. However, one thing I didn't like about the book was how the author would drag things out at parts. I prefer a book that's exciting at every part. If you have ever read the book When Zachary Beaver Came to Town, you would enjoy this book because it has a lot of the same type of comedy. Also, the small town setting makes them have the same feel. I would recommend reading this book if you are a teenage girl. You'll understand more of where the main character is coming from and dealing with.	2004-03-29

Sidda tells of the problems her mother had raising the children and of her mother's drinking and chain smoking problems. Also how Vivi was in and out of her life. She tells of the times her mother would beat her and her siblings. Vivi also tells her side of the story. <BR> I really enjoyed this book. It was better then the movie that has been made for the it.  The book goes much more into detail about the characters lives and problems. The Divine Secrets (...) also goes into more detail about what is going on. <BR> The only problem I had with The Divine Secrets (...) was that Vivi and the other three Ya-Ya's use strong language...a lot! Also that Vivi and Sidda would talk every other chapter. For example; the first chapter Sidda talks and the second chapter Vivi talks...and that's how the story is told. That was the only confusing thing to me. <BR> I would recommend this book to older readers because of the strong language.<BR>But this is a great book about love, betrayal, and memories.

She has to choose between one man that will be able to support her with all the finest things, while the other gentleman can barely support himself.<BR> The book kept me interested in what was going to happen next, but also gave me hints to what might go on. It was easy to read and follow along, besides the parts that Elsie's cousin was talking through her journal and the narrator was talking.  This book is apart of a series of eight books; this book is the last of the series. I recommend this book to teenage Christian girls. Throughout this book there was bible verses that relate to things in life.	2004-03-29

The plot was carefully planned out, and the main character is very hard to understand, which keeps you guessing.  This book would be greatly enjoyed by young teenage girls. <BR> There was nothing about this book that I didn't like.  Every part of this story kept me guessing on what would happen next.  Anyone who enjoys books that have a little suspense and humor would surely enjoy this well written novel.  So stop by your library and check out this great book.	2004-03-29

What would you do if you woke up one morning, took a shower in the dark, and shortly afterward, realized that you were invisible?  In this book, you can read through the trials and tribulations that 15 year old Bobby faces when he wakes up invisible, as well as the new people and challenges that Bobby meets.  Through games of hide and seek with the police, truant officers, the police, and his nosy neighbor with way too much time on her hands, Bobby isn't sure if his life will ever be back to normal.<BR> I really enjoyed this book. It was a good read, not paced too fast or slow, with a very original plot that was unlike any I've ever read before. It's not part if a series, but there would be no surprise if Andrew Clements wrote a sequel for his cliffhanger ending.  I think most teens would enjoy this laugh out loud book because it's about a teen.	2004-03-29

Tibby, Bridget, Carmen, and Lena, otherwise known as the Septembers, do everything together and have been best friends all their lives. They all share an amazing pair of jeans that fits all of the girls. The book picks up at the beginning of the second summer that the girls use the jeans. You have to read the book to find out their crazy rules for the jeans like, they can NEVER be washed, and what happens to them this summer.<BR> I liked this book because it is a heartwarming story of life, love, and friendship. You follow the girls through highs and the lowest of lows, to the end of their summer when they are reunited.<BR> One thing that I did not like about this book was how slow the book seemed to got started, but if you stick with it you will be in for an awesome ride. The second summer is a sequel to The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. I recommend that you need to read the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants first because you might be a little lost when the second book begins, but you don't have to. Any female over the age of 10 would like this book. Happy reading!	2004-03-29

New twists were thrown throughout the story to keep your attention at all times.<br />  Though i throughly enjoyed this story, I was disappointed how it ended. The previous books of this series had a well ended story, answering all questions possible in the readers mind. Among the Barons, however, felt like a cliff-hanger to me. There were a lot of questions left pondering in my mind as to what would happen next to the characters.

He loves this girl named Heather who is supposedly the best looking girl in Texas to the boys at her school and her and Austin hook up. At the beginning they had a very good relationship. Then something happened to the relationship that will change their own future.<BR>The part I liked was the way he was a good football player, had friends, and kind of related to real life. I also like how sometimes him and Heather really liked each other and in other times they hated each other. I liked that it wasn't a love story like it sounded. The thing I didn't like about it was how they went from not even knowing eachother to making out. I think it would have been a better book if they would have built up to their relationship.That was about the only thing I didn't like.

Then in the end she changes into a totally different girl that you would not think of her doing. The thing I like about this book is how she talks about her diabetes and how she is living in school with the diabetes. I also like how she changes into a whole different person and how her personality changes. I really hated a lot of things in this book. The most things I hated were when she was talking on a chat room on the web, and she was talking to people that thought they were vampires and she called them stupid.

He does his best to overcome his family troubles by playing baseball, which he loves and is very good at. While doing this he runs into more problems by playing baseball, but he doesn't quit. This is a great book when you think about doing what you love and not quiting. It was an inspirational book to me and it probably to many others.<br />What I liked about this book was that it expresses Shane Hunter's(the main character) feelings so that you feel that you are right there doing what Shane is doing. It also has many great baseball scenes, for a person that likes to play baseball you can relate to. It has him suffering and it has him starring. The book is a great balance of good and bad.<br />What I didnt like about this book is that it dragged some of the scenes out too much.

Her brother Dominic comes home from college and is very unloving toward Caitlin. She is at a very difficult part in her life and being harassed by an older teenage boy, Jamie Tait, doesn't help matters. She seems very self-satisfied, but deep down has a lot of confusion and questioning about herself. There are also a lot of people who disappoint her, such as her friend Bill who goes from a good girl reputation to a bad girl. Throughout the story she meets a guy named Lucas who is troubled as well, but for many different reasons. What happens with Lucas and Caitlin you will have to find out for yourself.<BR>     I really enjoyed Lucas and I thought the characters related well to real-life and the situations were also very real. They were situations that teenagers are faced with and can relate to. I like the plot of the book and it kept me interested in what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book to a lot of people.<BR>     However, I did not like the end of the book. There was a lot of good things that led up to the ending, but if I were writing the story I would make it end differently. The beginning of the book was also a little bit of a downfall to me. I believe I think this because it wasn't very interesting and compared to the rest of the book that was really interesting, the beginning seemed boring. It very quickly became interesting though, so the beginning wasn't horrible. So, if there was one thing I could change about Lucas it would definitely be the ending.	2004-02-12

This book was about a boy who got abused and his hope to survive. It tells you the hardship that Dave, the young boy who got abused, had to go through.

When you read this book it will really open your eyes about child abuse. It helps you understand how bad child abuse is and it tells you how much it hurt him physically and mentally. Dave has a few brothers, but they do not get abused like he does from his alcoholic parents. <BR>    I liked how this book told me about how abused children think of their life. Another thing I liked is it keeps you wondering if he is going to die from all the bad things he has to do.<BR>    One thing I didn't like was that the book built up the end, but then just left you wondering about how he ended up.	2004-02-12

After a while they start to make him do things that he doesn't want to do to stay in the group of friends.<BR> Some of the strengths of this book are that it was really good. The reason it was so good is because as soon as you start to read the book you can't let it down because you always want to now what happens next. If you ask me I do not think there are any weaknesses in this book.<BR> The book Shattering Glass is probably the best book that I have ever read. There might be a couple of books that are better, but this one is really good.<BR>  I highly recommend for everyone to read this. If you don't read this book you have no idea what you are missing because this book is so good.	2004-01-06

The one thing I would change is the beginning.  I thought it should have been more dramatic.<br /> Jake, the main character is a juvenile delinquent.  He has gotten kicked out of a lot of schools.  Now a girl by the name of E.D has to put up with him.  She didn't like him from the time she set eyes on him.

Instead of a story plot it has a good theme.<BR> Stand Tall was about a seventh grade boy named Tree. Tree was called this because he was really tall for his age. Tree was picked on a lot because he was so tall, and he wasn't very good at sports. Tree met a friend named Sophie and Sophie was an eighth grade girl that hot picked on by the popular girls. Tree had a grandpa named Leo who fought in the Vietnam war. Leo got his leg shot and had to have it amputated. Tree's parents divorced and he is still having problems expecting it especially during Christmas. Then something happens to their town and everyone has to stay at the school. Tree's dad's house is badly damaged so they have to fix it. Tree's brothers, Larry and Curtis, come home from college to help. Tree starts to feel that he fits in at the end of the book.<BR>The strength of this book is the theme it gives. The weakness would be that it keeps repeating itself. I would recommend this book because it has a really good theme.	2004-01-06

The walk is around 180 miles.  Garretty and 99 other people were sitting in the grass when the Lieutenant came to give them their numbers.  Garrety was number 47.  the walk was very difficult, and so were the rules. You couldn't stop, if you get 3 warnings you were shot.  If the person needs more water, the solider would go and give them a new canteen.  The winner (or the first person to cross) wins a $10,000 cash prize plus a wish of whatever he or she wants.<BR> I think that the book had some strengths because it was pretty good and that it was written pretty good and it described the people really good.  When he wrote it, it made you feel like you were actually in the book.<BR> If I were to compare this book to another one, I don't know what I would compare it with, because I haven't read any books about a people walking to and risking their lives trying to get a prize.<BR> I would recommend this book to people who like a little action, and suspense because you don't know what's coming up next. This book has some suspense because you don't know who's going to get shot next, and if who's going to make it.	2004-01-06

Vince on the other hand, doesnt want to have any thing to do with the business.  Vince has a best friend named Alex. Alex and Vince try to impress the girls at their school by doing weird things.

Turns out that his brother tied a guy up and threw him in the back of Vinces car with the pickneck blanket.

They dont want to hurt Vince because they are afraid of what Vinces dad might do to them if they do hurt Vince. Vince quits the football team when he finds out.

They figure out a way to become very rich by black mailing rich people who have something big to hide. But when they start to mess with the future president of the United States things start to get very messy for the three judges.<BR> I thing the major story in the book in the plot as the same with most of his other books. The way it was written it make you want to turn the next page because you can get so involved in the characters and their story.<BR> The only problems I have found about the book was that with going back and for the between the two stories it was sometimes hard to follow. I also think he did not focus on each set of characters as much as he should.<BR> I would recommend this book to anyone who has liked any of his past books and to anyone who is not afraid of his style of writing.<BR>  In my view this is still a very good book despite the ending. I would definetly read this book again.	2004-01-06

Well go and buy or rent the book and find out!  This book is defiantly one of the longer books.  I would recommend this book to fantasy/war people.  I did not think this book was short of anything.

He was committed for robbing a gas station. He did this crime with two others. They were Richard Evans and James King. In this book you will find out what each person will do to complete this crime. You will also see what James King did and why he is not just a robber.<br /> Some strength in this book is when they tell you what he does during court and also in his cell. There are also some weaknesses in this book one I would say is when the judge talks to people in the stands. They would sit there and talk to each other about something that does have anything to do if the court. It is better when they ask questions.<br /> I would recommend this book to anybody that would like to hold off to the end to find out what happened. I would also recommend this book to people that are kind of into robbing and then getting caught for doing the crime. For the people that would like to no what court and jail id like.	2004-01-06

One day he finds an email that says his step mom is cheating on his dad. He also likes a certain girl named Lisa, but he has never talked to her before. Then he got a job that she applied for too. Will they get together? Will Mick and tell his dad about the email.<BR> One thing that I like about the book is how Laura and Tom, the authors, put more than one problem in the book. I think it makes the book more exciting. I also like how there are different point of views. Like one chapter it will be Mick telling the story, and then it will be Lisas point of view. <BR>  A thing that I dont like about it is that they didnt put too much information about his step mom, Nora. That was the first problem in the beginning, but then all these other problems happened and they kind of forgot about that situation. <BR>  I would defiantly recommend this book. Its exciting and funny. If you like drama books, then you would like Zipped.	2004-01-06

They would meet in the woods and talk and exchange goods.<BR>  Overall the book was great. The best part of the whole book was when they got to the New World and began to build there new village. Some of the weaknesses of the book were that at some parts it got a little confusing. If you find any confusing then I would advise you to go back and read that part again or else you would be really lost.<BR> I would recommend this book to anyone who is over the age of 12.

There is a third part and the Hobbits that are living return home and find out they have to save that as well.<br /> This story has good strengths.  It all played out.  I would suggest reading the other books first.  There weren't many weaknesses in the story.  I couldn't find any.  But if you don't like the jumping around then I wouldn't suggest it to you.<br /> I would recommend this book to you if you like the myths of the world along with humans mixed together in the fight to survive.	2004-01-06

If you like a touching book, then this is definitely for you. This book was about a boy named Brent who's pretty young, but old enough to have his license. Brent means well, he cares for everyone but he wasn't in, what people call it \\"the in group\\". Johnathan was one of Brent's friends and he tried to include him on as much as he could, like going to parties together and doing basic guy things.<br /> One night a terrible thing happened. Brent hit a girls named Lea. Lea was killed. The Zamora family, which was Lea's family, had to go to court with Brent's family. After going through that whole mess with the judge, Brent felt terrible about what he had done. Brent told Mrs. Zamora if there was anything he could do to make it up to them, so she told Brent to put a certain kind of post in the four corners of the United States. The four corners of the United States are Washington, California, Florida, and Maine. The post was called a whirligig.<br /> This was a good book; I like how real it seemed. It was almost like I was there. There wasn't much of this story that I didn't like. If this sounds like your kind of book you should read it.	2004-01-06

It is also the first book in the series.	2004-01-06

He got a letter from his mom and it said that his mom let them take him to be with his father. <BR> One of the strengths of the book is it had a lot of history and I like history when there is a war.

Was the baby murdered?  All of these questions are whirling around in your head as you read this four-starred book.  Soon after the baby is discovered, the police arrive with a detective named Liz. Liz accused an eighteen-year-old young lady with murder.  Katie Fisher denies such an action.  Katie Fisher is the daughter who lives on the farm.  She is sent to trial and you will not believe what happens.  <br /> The strengths of this book are that it would always have the reader hanging with suspicion of what will happen next.  You are always wondering what happened to the baby and if Katie will lose or win in her trial.<br /> The weakness, in my eyes, were the visual pictures in my head of the physical activity going on throughout the book.  Katie always refers back to the thoughts of a very close friend.  Some of the activity involved is a little too much for me.<br /> Even though I feel that the weakness has a big hold in this book, the positives have a stronger one.  I would recommend it to many people who enjoy mystery stories.  This book is enjoyable to read in your spare time.  I would read this book again.	2004-01-06

I would suggest this book to any teenage girl!  That's probably the only bad thing about this book: guys won't enjoy or understand it as well as girls. If they do read it though, they would learn a lot about girls!<BR> Jessica Darling is the main character. She feels like she has no life after her best friend. Hope moves away. But she does have a life; a very complex life! Jessica thinks just like any other teenage girl: about friendships, school, her social life, her looks, and other things that you will love to read about. This book is basically Jessica's journal with some e-mails to Hope. So it is neat to follow along with her life as it happens.<BR> Whenever everything seems to go wrong in her life, Jess runs into Marcus Flutie. He becomes a big part of her life. She has always said that her boyfriend should be like a \\"male Hope\\". That's exactly what Marcus is because him and Hope are the only ones who truly understand her, but Jess just cant make herself realize that.....until the end. <BR> I believe that any teenage girl will be able to relate to this story. It will make you laugh out loud the whole time your reading. It also makes you think about your own life and how to handle your problems. You will find yourself trying to be a better friend and realizing who your true friends are!<BR>	2004-01-06

Now she must meet a cannibal.  She met this person once before and will face him again.  She met him a long time ago and put him in prison for a while.  His name was Dr. Hannibal Lector.<br /> I do like this book, because it fits me, well short of.  It is an action packed book with some grouse, bloody scenes.  I saw the movie to this book before.  This book as well as the movie contains a lot of action right from the start of the book..  The reason why I didn't like this book is because it does contain some romance and some old time stuff or past history tings as some of us will put it.<br /> This is a good book for most of you people out there.	2003-11-26

It takes place in the mid-1800's on a plantation.  Elsie lives with her grandpa and step grandma.  She also lives with many of her aunt and uncles who are around her age.  This book is about Elsie's Christian life and her struggles with her family.  She has ups and downs, particularly with one character, her father.  Elsie has a very hard life but continues to strengthen her relationship with Christ.  She has to make many choices which could risk her life with God.  I very much enjoyed this book.  It was easy to relate to and it motivated me to have a relationship with God like Elsie.  Even thought the young girl is only eight, she is very advanced in her faith.  This book shows me hoe Elsie gets through her struggles.  This is amazing to me because I have such a hard time and my struggles don't even compare to hers.  This book also goes into great detail and puts you in Elsie's place.  It keeps you guessing at how the different characters will react and keeps you turning the page.  I would suggest this book to anyone who is having struggles believing in Christ.  Elsie will encourage you to believe through her words and actions.  This book was a true inspiration to me and helps me to grow strong in my faith.  I hope that you chose this book to read so you can do the same!	2003-11-26

Bryce was a new kid in the neighborhood and just so happened to move I right across from Julianna.  She seems to have some really strong feelings for Bryce.  He is to shy and just plain is terrified of her. Will they ever like each other?<BR> I was really interested in this book, because it kept me asking for more.  Every time I was supposed to go to bed I would end up reading past that time.  I really also enjoyed it because it was about a boy and a girl who grow to be my age throughout the story.  Julianna seems to have a lot of characteristics that seem to relate to the way that I act.  She likes to go overboard in trying to make Bryce like her, so she can finally get her first kiss.  This was what made the book such an attention grabber.  It seemed that when I started that I would have to read till the very end on the first day.  Another reason that this book was so good was the fact that the narrator switches from Bryce to Julianna every chapter.  It lets you hear both sides of the story. It kind of makes you wonder who is telling the truth and who is lying.  All in all this was the best book I have ever read.	2003-11-26

His mother was a drug addict and when she couldn't take care of him anymore she gave him up for adoption.  He was very young when he was given up.  His new parents then shortened his name to T.J.  T.J. has a huge amount of athletic ability but doesn't go out for any sports because he doesn't like being told what to do by a coach.  Soon he is approached about starting his own swim team.  After agreeing to do this, he gets together a bunch of guys who would probably never be able to get a varsity letter in anything else, and puts them on the swim team.  The story tells about how the boys form together as a team and make some new friendships.<BR> Once I was done with this book I thought it was a great book.  The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought that the book had a slow start.  I loved the way that the book was very athletic but still had some very serious sides to it.  I thought the ending of the book was very good too although I wasn't expecting it and I'm usually not a big fan of surprise endings!	2003-11-26

First of all her family dies in what she calls the dark day. A gang comes and steels all of her clothes, and then she goes with them. The leader of the gang dies about five years later. She can't handle it so she goes to the docks. She has always wanted to be a sailor. She tells the captain that she can read and she is enrolled as a ships boy. The only problem is that no one can find out that she is a girl otherwise she will be hanged. The other boys start to wonder why she doesn't stick around when they take a swim. Finally she tells one boy that she is a girl. He is astonished. Then they fall in love. I didn't like this book very much because there was not very much action. I guess it was sort of a girl's book. I picked it out because the title sounded pretty good. Then I read the summary and it talked about pirates and blood. But they only come upon a couple of pirate ships. Everything else is she is just worried about if she will get caught. I will not tell you what happens next. You have to read. I guess that is why they say never judge a book by its cover.	2003-11-26

It wasn't the best book I have read but I didn't dread reading it.  This book was about two girls who are best friends and they are going into their freshman year of school.  It tells you about how their relationship changes throughout the year.  There were some parts that were somewhat opinionated, but that's reality.  This book is all about reality.  The things that happen in this book really do happen.  The meaning of this book was good, and that is why i liked this book.  It shows what a true friendship is all about.  It also shows who you're real friends are.  It shows how through all the tough times your friends are there for you.  When you enter into your high school years you will form new friendships and you will loose old ones.  I think that if i was given the chance to read this book again I wouldn't, only because it is not a book that you read over and over again.  I don't think that I would recommend this book to anyone, but if they asked I would say it was a good book.	2003-11-26

He lives in a small town that loves football.  The small town is Oil Camp in Louisana.  The whole book takes place in one day and their are alot of memories too.  It is all about the State Championship with the Oil Camp Roughnecks and the Pineview Pelicans.<BR>I hate the book because at first I couldn't tell when the story was taking place because of the memories.  I hated how it ended.  Ti was all leading up to the big game, but when they got to it, the book ended.  During the second play the game ended, what's up with that!  I wanted to know who won the game, but it never came.  Not even the final score.  I also hated it because it had no action.  The most action was when Travis forearmed someone in the book.  To make the book better, all they had to do was to have the football game in the book.  I did not even get the plot of the book.  I do not even think their was a plot.  <BR>That is what I think of the book called Roughnecks.  That is why I gave it two stars.	2003-11-26

It has great political and economical intrigue. It is made great by the qualities and the diversity of the main character, Cerryl. He is a young white mage in the city of Fairhaven. He was a Patrol Mage, an assassin, and a temporary governor of a recently captured city.<BR> <BR>  The strengths and weaknesses of Cerryl made the book good but how money and economics influenced the course of action made this very realistic. The political backstabbing made the book very interesting.<BR> Also another book written by the same author blended into this story but was told by the good side. This book was written from the evil side.<BR> Coming to a conclusion this book is a great read. It is not very easy to follow but is still great.	2003-11-26

The author wrote it so well; I didn't want to put the book down and stop. The Rudest Alien on Earth is about an alien who came to Earth on a mission from her planet. So, the whole book talks about her adventures on earth.<BR> One thing that thought was interesting was wondering what she would turn into, because she was not in her normal shape. She toke the form of things on earth, to blend in with everything. Some of the things she turned into were a dog and a fly. Another thing I thought that made this book good was that it explained things on earth. This happened because the Alien didn't know what any thing was on earth was. So one girl helped the alien out the girl explained things that we all know of. A couple of thing the girl had to explain was stories and what school was.<BR> Also something I thought that was neat; is that the alien was great at Math. She could do very hard problems in her head quickly. This was way different then the little girl who wasn't good at Math. She even said that she hated Math and numbers.<BR> The Rudest Alien on Earth was one of the best books I have read. If this paper sounds like a good book then you will most likely like this book. Plus this is only some of the good things about this book.	2003-11-26

I thought this book was very good. This book was good because it had actually taken place in a jail. I thoguht that was neat because I have never read a book like this before. This book also takes place in the point of view of a movie. This gives excellent visuals. Some bad things about MOnster are how the book is written. It makes you look weird because the words are spaced out and seems easy. This book also took along time to find out who was guilty ohe crime committed. I didn't like it because it held me up in suspence for too long. Some other good things about this book are, the way the main character, Steve, writes a journal and it is put in the book. The way the imates are discribed is also excellent. The front cover of the book is very interesting. The title Monster and the picture of Steve makes you wonder why it is called Monster. When the characters are in court it feels like you are in the room with them. The way the book uses its vocabulary is also nicley done. If I were to rate this book I would give it a four stars out of five. My reasons for this are all listed above. You should read this book if you like court,suspence, and actioned books. I haven't read any other books by this author,nor do I like to read but this book was thrilling.	2003-10-24

It starts out as Juli having a mayjor crush on Bryce but he hates her!  He tries everything to get her to stop liking him.  Bryce does some stupid things during the seven years that she likes him.  Finally Bryce sees the true side of Juli.  The roles get flipped when Bryce starts to like Juli and Juli hates Bryce!  I really liked this book a lot. I especially liked it when Juli would not get out of the tree because she liked it so much.  Also I liked the fact that the cover really makes you think about what it is about.  I thought the book was really funny which is something that I like about books.  I thought the part about the basket boys was funny and really cute.  Something that I really enjoyed about Juli was that she has so much determination.  When she wants to get something done she does it and doesn't just talk about it.  Also I liked the part when you learn about Juli's family background.  One thing that I didn't like was that one chapter was Bryce telling his side of the story and the next was Juli retelling the story in her own words.  I think many people like this book.  The book really leaves you hanging.  What will happen with Juli and Bryce?  Will they have a future together?  Find out by reading the book Flipped.	2003-10-24

Hush Little Baby, is a book about a girl and her dad's second ex-wife. The girls name is Kit; she has been hanging out with a new guy named, Rowen. Shea, Rowen's cousin and Kit's best friend, has told Kit that Rowen has a HUGE crush on Kit. Kit has been through a lot because of her parents divorce. She is trying to be a person with out a personality. She does not show her emotions and has become very good at it. Dust is Kit's ex-step mother. Unlike Kit, Dusty has a very distinct personality of being known as an idiot. Kit is at her dad's house looking for a sweatshirt when Dust pulls up and practically throws her baby into Kit's arms. With the baby in Kit's arm and Kit in complete shock, Kit watches as Dusty drives away without telling Kit a thing about the baby. Kit stays at her dad's house for quite a long time with the baby she has named, Sam the Baby. Rowen and his sister, Muffin, come over and find Kit with a baby. Of course they think the worst and think the baby belongs to Kit. Kit, Rowen, Muffin, and Sam the Baby, go trying to find Dusty and try and find the babies dad. Along the way of finding clues and crazy, smart, and people like Dusty, they find out a secret about Sam the Baby. They begin to wonder.... \\"Would a mom sell her baby like worn out clothing\\"? I really liked the book because of the mystery and suspense involved. The part I didn't like was the ending. It sort of left you hanging and it didn't really fit the book. It is a great book to read!	2003-10-24

It is about a girl who wants to play baseball, and how the baseball star and a girl that wants to join the team start a relation ship. It is also about how they get through the season with all of the changes of a girl playing on a boy's baseball team. As you can imagine thier are many diffrent conflicts that go along with a girl playing on the boys team. Also her new, friend the star pitcher of the team, is against her playing on the boys team. He also doesn't think that a girl can make it in boy's baseball. Read this book and find out how they overcome their diffrences and become lovers. This is a good book and I really advise you to read it if you enjoy a compelling romantic baseball story. I give it two thumbs up.	2003-10-24

Everyone clicks-except her.  People hate her individuality.  They just can't accept the different things about her.  And influenced by a frined, she'd loose all identiy of herself to become popular.<BR>  I like this story because it's real with things that teens have to deal with like peer pressure.  I also had a really good message: Don't be afraid of yourself.  This book reallt exposes that.  Sometimes, the book is confusing, like the whole desert scene, but other than that it is a really good book.	2003-04-25

I mean the kids could have met a little differently. that's because who meets someone on vacation that they don't know and they just saw shoot a guy, and after he sees the one kid shoot the man he talks to him like they have been friends forever. Then they start hanging out every day. <BR>  The only good part is the mystery behind the fake man and how it ends. It ends completely different then I thought it would. At first you'll think the old man is a kingpin drug dealer, but i guess you'll have to read it to find out how it ends.	2003-04-25

Samantha Madison has wiry, copper-red hair & an all black wardrobe. SHe is your avergae rebellious girl. She spent most of her life hiding in the shadows of her older cheerleading sister and younger genuis sister until, she saves the President of the United States from an assassination attempt. Now she's constantly followed by news reporters and is the most popular girl in her school. Will her lfe ever return to normal? Will she be able to venture from the spotlight long enough to realize who she's fallen in love with?<br />  Meg Cabot is a wonderful author. She's written the Princess Diaries Series and if you love Mia Thermopolis you won't be disappointed by Samantha and her crazy life.<br />  I feel that All-American Girl could easily relate to any teenager, even the non-rebellious. You learn that maybe just because you're labeled one way doesn't mean you must act that way. If you're popular you don't have to own an all Abercrombie and Fitch wardrobe. If you're not popular it doesn't mean you have to be a goth or punk. You don't have to be an individual either, just be yourself. The story also teaches you to see a situation and life for what it is not just what you know or think.	2003-04-25

I gave my story three stars out of five, because I don't really like the idea of becoming a superhero. I didn't like reading this book, and it wasn't even close to the best book I've ever read. The only part that was interesting was a sixteen year old punk, becoming a hero. Other than that, I didn't like it. it's hard to follow, and it's way too long, it took forever to read. Three stars isn't bad, but it wasn't the best. I would have rather picked something else to read. What kind of name is the Blue Avenger?

While you learn about that person and her story the man from the story has a romance going on too. The book switches back from one story to another. <br />I would recommend this book for someone that has a good imagination and can handle two story lines at once. Some of the book seems boring but in the end the book is worth it. The author of the book describes the characters in a way so that you can visualize them clearly in your head and you feel like you're there with them, going through what they are, and experiancing the same feelings they are.	2003-04-25

I did get confused when the judge would stay things that I didn't get very will. The auother told, wrote down in his eye view. He said what he thought about being in jail. He told the reader what he didn't do or did do about the accident. He gave the reader many different views of this problem. When he was in court or in jail he would write down who said what and who did what. Now after I read the book, I think that in the middle of the book they were taking it slow to get the end of the case. It is really interesting to now that not all blacks do bad things. When I would start reading I would get a lot read in so many minutes. The book was worte in a movie form. I think that this is a very good book. It just would take me time to read it because I have to read like I am in the book. I don't know, but I hope there is a second book coming out. I think that this topic that the main character had to go through was intersting. I enjoyed this book.	2003-04-25

It tells a story about War World 2, and it shows the opinion of the war in two different perspectives.

After reading about the 3rd chapter I did not want to read anymore because there was no action or any creep. I think it only deserves 2 stars because i thought it was a really bad book. <BR> A little bit about the book is it takes place in Sunnydale, where all theh \\"supernatural\\" stuff goes down. Willow is the library nerd, she's in there all the time. She meets this guy over the internet. Their friendship grew and she fell in love with him, so they were going to meet. But there was something she didn't know about him and when she finds out she is going to be shocked!	2003-02-13

It makes you just want to jump into the book and just go at her!  It really does make you very mad though.  Only people who beat a child for no apparent reason at all is an absolute freak who has major issues!  I can understand something like a spanken or one smack on the face for doing something bad, but not being beat up.  this book is based on a true story.  It is one of the top three most abusive life stories in the world.  If I knew anybody that has a life like that, I would do something about it.  Nobody ever deserves to be treated the way this little helpless boy was.  What this woman did is terrifying.	2003-02-13

I really didn't care for it. it is basically a bunch of short stories about people on how they don't fit in. Alot of it was untrue because people only act bad when they are not liked by others. I also think it deserved 2 stars because it had a bunhc of short stories and there is no boring parts in it. If it would of been a long book i dont think to many peple would be interested in it. Over all i think if somone get's the book they should through it away.	2003-02-13

The book was not very long but it could have been much shorter.  I think that the book was dragged out making it longer than what it needed to be.  Also, it was confussing at the beginning because it kept switching to different characters point of view during the chapters.  I think that the book could have been just as good if it stuck with only one or two characters and still be good.  Instead the author portrayed almost every characters point of view.  I thought it made it con fussing but someone else may like it.  <BR>  This book is about a fourteen year old girl named Anna Sophia Lockwood who can go through time.  She had visited time before and fell in love with a boy named Strat who belongs to a rich family.  When she comes to visit again she finds out that Strats dad had put Strat into an asylum because he talked to other people about Anna going through time.  Even thought the whole family knew it was true they would not admit it to the public that way the public didnt think that the whole family was crazy.  Devony was Strats sister and she was very mad at Anna because she screwed up their perfect life.  Devonny tells Anna that it was all Annas fault and tells Anna to rescue Strat from the asylum because Devvony for her dad is controlling what she can and can not do. <BR>  Anna now has to fit in with another century and avoid the dangers of not having a male escort.  [Many women in those days were thought to be an outcast of a family if they dont have escorts.]  Anna has to overcome many hardships in order to survive the wilderness on her own; also she has to look out for Devvonys fiancé who will stop at nothing in order to get Devvonys family fortune.	2002-11-26

It's about a girl who lives with her grandma until she is hung for being a witch. Then the girl is sent across the sea to the New World. When she gets there she changes her name to Mary and lives with a woman named Martha. Eneryone in her town starts to suspect that there is a witch among them. From this point many exciting things happen until finally at the end Mary is forced to make a life saving choice. I liked this book so much because it's very exciting and the book is written from a real journal from the Salem Witch Trials. The only thing I didn't like about the book was the way they did the ending. The journals ended so they had to have someone else's piont of view and it wasn't as good. I still thought this book was good enough to give 5 stars and I think you would enjoy reading it.	2002-11-21

I didn't really understand it. Two main reasons that I started reading this book is because of the cover of the book and it had finger prints on it and that reminds me of criminals. I love reading books about criminals. And I guess u already know this is about criminals well sort of. Because Steve was getting some stuff in a food store and his friends said they would buy it for them so when they came out they said they paid for and they really didn't so he got put in jail for it. So he writes what happens in the form of a movie. So if you like criminal books, and like it in movie text, you will like this book.	2002-11-21

I enjoyed this book so much.<br />  The thing that I enjoyed most about this  book is that it's so easy to read. It does have three hundred and ninty nine pages in it, it is so easy. The chapters are about one to two pages long. This book gets off track sometimes, but then it picks up tremendously. There is a downside, I gave this book four stars instead of five because it has a bit more profanity that it should have. This book is about a murderer in America and a murderer in Europe and they both lead Alex Cross( a Washington D.C. police officer) and the rest of the bureu to a big case. Also another murderer is on the loose, Gary Soneji, who has vowed to kill Cross and his family. the two murders play a dangerous game of cat and mouse with Cross.	2002-11-21

It is about a fifteen-year-old girl named Annie who travels back in time--one hundred years to be exact!  This book tells about Annie's romance in the present, and \\"back in time\\".<BR>     I liked and disliked this book for many reasons.  I liked this book because it has a good story line.  I could relate to Annie in many ways, too.  One thing I could relate to her with is when she had to choose which side she wanted to be on-the present or stay back in time.  I have had to choose sides just like she did and I hated making someone sad or upset just like she did. <BR>     I disliked the book also.  One reason was because the text went back and forth between scenes and it was confusing.  The narrator starts talking and you figure out that it is a different scene and different people are talking.  Another reason I didn't like this book is because there were so many characters and the book tells you who they are once, but after that you have to remember who they are, and if you don't, you have to look it back up in the book.<BR>     I would give this book a four star because it was good, but it wasn't the greatest book I have read.  I would recommend this book to anyone that likes mystery, drama, and romance.	2002-11-21

I would highly recommend this book to any one that enjoys adventure.  The book starts out with the main characters, Scott and his older brother Gregg; have to move to Colorado to live with an uncle they never new they had.  Their uncle owns his own rafting company on the Arkansas River.  At first life is a little rough because they are still trying to get over their parents death.  As it goes most things get better in life, this story gets better for the most part.  Scott is left out by his brother because he is a lot younger than Gregg.  One day during the summer Scott goes exploring in the back yard.  He finds an old bike in a shed.  Scott decides to go into town on the rickety old bike.  In town he goes to the library because he is kind of a bookworm.  At the library he meets a girl!!  That is all I'm going to tell you about the book.  If it sounds interesting to you, read it.  I liked it; it takes a really good book to do that because I don't ever read.  This is a really good book, ~ENJOY~!!!!!!!!	2002-11-21

Most of this book is all fantasy about dragons, dwarves, hobbits, elves, and all that other fantasy stuff.  Also the names of the people and places are so long, thy'er hard to pronounce.  You can't remember the names of some of the charactors because some of them are so similar.

I honestly didn't like the book in the beginning. I didn't like it because the main character tried to hide the fact that he had taken a life of a young boy. He did this to try to protect a vineyard behind his house in the wine region state of California. He also tried to hide it because of his wife and child. I think that he should have just told the truth in the first place because he ended up trying to defend the man that the police had brought in for questioning. He was the only one that knows the truth about what actually happenend. To find out other things that happened, read this book.	2002-11-21

As her treatment with her therapist progresses, the story to why she cuts herself starts starts to unfold. What happens next? I don't know. You'll have to read the read the book to find out.<BR>    The reason I like this book is because it keeps you wanting to read more. In the beginning it's not the best and kind of hard to understand, but once you get further into the book you never want to put it down. Each page you turn just keeps getting more exciting than the previous page. I hope you take the time to enjoy this book as much as I have.	2002-11-21

In Sin Killer it did not give very much information and it was not clear. It talked about where they were going but  the author jumped around on many subjects. The author would be  talking about one thing then all of the sudden he would be talking about else. I would reccommend this book to people that are older mature and can read very well. I think  this book was more written for adults  than young adults. This book was mainly about a girl who moved to America. When they got there they bought a steamboat and started to travel the rivers of the west. It talks about what goes on the in the wild west and the adventures they have. This bookis best suited for adults.	2002-11-21

At his new school he meets Romiette Cappelle, an African girl who he has a growing liking for. Because Romiette is hanging out with a hispanic, the two lovers are hassled by a purple wearing, black gang,but hassle quickly turns into violence.<BR>   I liked this book because it has great suspense that keeps you at the end of your chair. It is also neatly written and easy to understand. Since the characters in this book are teens, it is easy for me to see from their point of view and to understand them.<BR>   Something that I didn't enjoy about this book is that it continuosly switches point of view. I think though, that you get use to it by the end of the book.  <BR>   One of the things that I liked best about this book is that its plot is so different. It's unique from every other book I've read, which makes it even more enjoyable.	2002-11-21

She knows it is something more dangerous than just some prank phone calls, so she tries to figure out the whole story about the strange things that have been going on.<BR> I think this was a really good book because you really didn't know what was going to happen next. There were a lot of twists and turns in the book, and I could really relate to the main character. She did most of the stuff that I would have done. But, some parts were kind of hard to understand, so you had to read it carefully.

I don't think that it's the best book, but it was alright.  Blind Date was about a guy named Kerry who was set up for a blind date with Mandy from his school.  Mandy was kind of strange.  Like the time she picked up Kerry dressed up in a poncho(which is a rain coat).  I thought this book was kind of neat though when Mandy would stick up for Kerry, because the football players would pick on him.  Thwe reason they picked on him was because he broke the starting quaterback's leg on their football team so he quit.  Later on you'll find out if Mandy is the girl of Kerry's dreams or a real nightmare for Kerry.  I recommend this book for people that like mystery books.	2002-11-21

If you liked the book \\"The Contender\\" I would highly recomend this book.<BR>      The book is mainly about two 13-year-old boys named Ruben and Cameron Wolfe who are twin brothers that have a very poor family that is struggling to pay bills and eat. But then one day a guy by the name of Perry who owns a boxing arena saw them fighting in their back yard each with one glove. Then Perry pursuades them to become boxers. Cameron struggles a lot in his matches, while Ruben goes undefeated with all TKO's. Cameron eventually gets jealous of Ruben, because Ruben is not only getting more attention in the arena and at school, but a girl named Stephenie, who Cameron likes, now wants to go out with Ruben. Will the brothers eventually solve their problems at home and in life in the end? I would recomend this book to anyone who wants a book that is interesting and fun to read.	2002-11-21

Clara is a 15 year old girl who is having many troubles with her social life. She loses her best friend when her friend is accepted by a group that Clara will never be in. Along with her social life disasters her parents are having difficulties. Her father is always out of town and her mother doesn't know what to do with herself. When her mother gets offered a job in Spain Clara has no idea what she should do next.<br />Then she meets a boy named Amos Mackenzie who, it seems, is having the same problems she is having. He had lost his father of cancer and, just like clara, has no idea of what to do next. When these pair meet up the trouble begins.<BR>I liked this book a lot because it was a book that people my age can relate to. I also liked it because it is very realistic because the things that happen in this book happen in real life. The only thing that you have to watch for is the change of view points which happen every chapter.	2002-11-21

Ghost Soldier is not the best story to read. I think the book could of been longer. That is the only thing I don`t like about the book. The story takes place in North Carolina. the main person in the story is Alexander. I like the story just because, it deals with ghost. It all depends on what you like to read.

This book was pretty good, but it didn't have loads of excitement in it.

Some of the stories are good and some of them are dumb. A good story is the one about the hidden driver.Some of the ones that are bad is the one were some people hear a noise and they think that it was a ghost. It is kind of a hrd book to under stand, but over all it is a good book. The book is about Chris Woodyard going around Ohio and finding ghost stories. I have read a similiar is called the Bone Collecter. It is about a murder that kill people and leaves a bone clue.I think that you should at least read one of the hauted ohio books.	2002-11-21

Once you pick it up you won't want to put it back down. Wanted! is about Alice who is normal 15-year-old girl until one very fateful day. Alice's dad called her frantically and asked her to drive his prized corvette and meet him at their favorite ice-cream place and bring the two disks labeled twin with her. He didn't even care that she didn't have her license yet. Alice thought it was strange, but she followed her father's instructions anyways. Before she could leave she heard an intruder and had to hide until he left. Alice left as quickly as she could after the intruder left and finally made it to the ice-cream place. When her father didn't call or meet her there she became worried. To calm her nerves Alice flipped on the radio and heard an announcement that her father was murdered and she was the lead suspect. They even said that they had an E-mail confession from Alice. Suddenly Alice wasn't normal anymore. She was a fugitive, and she had to find the real murderer before she was caught by the police. Or even worse the murderer. This was an excellent murder mystery that left me wanting to read more. It had an excellent plot and good descriptions. Caroline B. Coonie is an excellent writer. I think that this is her best book, and it is my favorite book of all. She described Alice's reactions so well it seemed real. I strongly recommend that you read this book, especially if you enjoy murder mysteries.	2002-11-21

I like books that are full of suspence or that have a unpredictable ending. This book was mostly about a girl and the troubles that she has to deal with in life. The book would be interesting to people who want to know about other kind of lifestyles in life. Some people are wealthy and life comes easy to them, but for Tori her life is rough and confusing. The book is about a girl and her life, having her father just died, her mother and her smoking problems, and her relationship with Hugh, a guy she knows. So in conclusion I think you should give this book a chance.	2002-11-21

I liked this book, \\"What Janie Found\\", and I didn't like it.I didn't like it because It started out slow. The book didn't describe the things that were needed to be described. The things that were described usually were the small things of the story. The things I liked about this book are that when it described things, it described them good. The aurthor sticks to the things that happened in her past a lot. I wold recomend this book to anyone who likes mysteries. The main character in my book goesthrough some hard times in her life but, she gets through them. For example,she gets kidnapped and bairly ever sees her real family. It seems very hard for her to go through all of that. I still like this book though even if it has a little mix up of the describing. I have read the whole set of the books. They really intrest me a lotso take the chance and read them, you'll like them!	2002-11-21

I honestly didn't like the book in the beginning. I didn't like it because the main character tried to hide the fact that he had taken a life of a young boy. He did this to try to protect a vineyard behind his house in the wine region state of California. He also tried to hide it because of his wife and child. I think that he should have just told the truth in the first place because he ended up trying to defend the man that the police had brought in for questioning. He was the only one that knows the truth about what actually happenend. To find out other things that happened, read this book.	2002-11-21

It seemed really unreal with a lot of the stuff that was in the book. I know fictional books aren't supposed to be real, but I think Wiilliam Sleator really strecthed the meaning of fictional. I mean, it seemed as everything was made up right off hand and I didn't really think the book flowed very well. For example, at the beginning of the book it talked about this really historical house that the new neighbors that moved in next to it were really interested in the house. They always were over there, rooting through stuff in the house. I thought it was going to be a good mystery story about the hosue, and it turned out that they never talked about the book again in the story. After a few mind-teasing sentences, the book totally switched topics and started talking about some darn board game. So unless you enjoy wasting your time reading pointless books, I recommend that you don't read Interstellar Pig.	2002-11-21

Pedrito! starts out a little slow and has a loose plot but, in the whole time there is something happening. This book provides a good mental image of what is happening almost like a movie. This book was a joy to read along with a funny twist. What do you think would happen if a South American revolutionary terrorist leader would switch places with an elegant, proper, and an identical twin of him that was a high ranked Naval Intelligance Officer? To find out you need to read this book. It will keep you guessing the whole way through.	2002-11-21
