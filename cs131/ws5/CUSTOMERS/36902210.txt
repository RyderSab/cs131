US	36902210	R24T4MB7F5YSVA	1590595122	814688885	Pro ADO.NET 2.0 (Expert's Voice)	Books	5	10	12	N	N	A masterpiece from start to finish.	From start to finish, Sahil knocked the ball out of the park.  This book serves as a definitive guide to ADO.NET 2.0 and manages to hold the readers interest throughout.  Over and over again, he drills down into the more challenging areas that developers have to deal with and gives a ton of real world advice on it.  The ADO.NET coverage is obviously a little more in depth than the XML coverage, but that's totally to be expected.  A few areas that really stick out are Transactions (which has been dramatically changed in the 2.0 Framework) both simple and distributed.  He does a great job of explaining all the jargon in an easy to understand way.  Connection Pooling is another (less sexy but every bit as important) area that stands out.  So many people get into trouble here and he covers all of the why's so well that there's no room for any ambiguity. I also really liked his discussion of 'Cowboy' type connections  - you'll have to buy the book to see what I'm talking about though.<br /><br />I thought his first ADO.NET book was as good as they get and he repeated his success here.  Wonderful from start to finish.	2005-10-04

Sara just straight up kicks butt with this book.  Is it for Beginners trying to learn .NET?  NO!  Is it for intermediate programmers that work as developers simply b/c it's a way to earn a living.  NO!  Is this  a book for adrenaline junkie programmers who like doing stuff few if any others have done.  YEP.  I have well over 100 books on .NET and other than the proposed one I'm working on, not 1 covers Speech Server.  Sara jams on it.  Data Mining is another great area - sure, Data Mining is not inherently the sexiest subject out there, but she makes it cool.<br /><br />There are definitely zillions of other books out there to teach you .NET in general and this IS NOT that type of book.  But if you're looking to expand your horizons, and have a lot of fun learning some really cool aspects of advanced .NET Technologies, this book is without competition!	2005-09-03

A totall bad ass.<br /><br />About two weeks ago, he wrote me and and mentioned that he wrote a book and was wondering if I'd review it.<br /><br />Ok, Minh - here's your review:<br /><br />--------------------- BUY THIS BOOK - IT KICKS A33 ----------<br /><br />This book is nothing short of a masterpiece.  [...]My absolute favorite one - although not the most 'important one' in on Page 20 Figure 23 - Creating Rectangular Sections.  No, this isn't about GDI+ it's about the IDE.  How in the hell this didn't get picked up by a major publisher is beyond me - but the publisher did a great job.<br /><br />This book isn't about .NET per se, it's all about it IDE - (although a book about the IDE and O.P.P. would be really COOL).  I could babble on and on -but I don't need to - Minh just straight up Kicks ass and takes no prisoners.  If you wanna keep it real with the IDE - by both books, they'll pay for themselves by LunchTime.	2004-12-02

This book has bailed me out many times and it's a great C# reference book.  Virtually every aspect of C# is covered and while not everything is discussed in depth, everything but regular expressions are discussed well with some good examples.<br />He's got a great mix of practical examples coupled with 'why it works this way' content to make it a great read.<br />I wish he'd have written more on Regex's, but that doesn't detract from the book at all.  And the fact he covers Remoting more than makes up for it.<br />This is a really great book.	2004-05-05

If your idea of graphics programming is making a ball bounce across the screen in Flash or Powerpoint, avoid this book.  If you are a die hard programmer with a strong mathematical background looking to create some really kick a33 effects, this book is made for you.<br />The background stuff:  There are just under 50 authors that have collaborated to create this book.  Just about all of them have a Ph.D from big name schools and I believe every one of them has at least a Master's degree.  Most, but not all are folks from NVIDIA.  The whole book is about 800 pages including intro/indexes et al.<br />I really liked the book, but there's two things wrong with it.  1)  If you don't have a VERY strong background in Graphics programming, you will be utterly clueless what's going on.  There's No middle ground. 2)  You need a pretty powerful graphics card to work through the examples, which, considering the target audience isn't unfair for them to assume.  I have a fairly powerful card on my desktops, but my laptop just doesn't cut it and that's kind of a pain if you read on the run like I do.<br />As far as negative comments go, that's it.<br />So what's cool about it?  The EFFECTS!  Like I mentioned, if there's a cool special effect in a video game or movie, this book shows you how to do it. To summarize a few:<br />1)  Uru:  Ages Beyond Myst.  If you are familiar with the game and the large bodies of water that are employed, Chapter 1 explains it in depth.  There's a good discussion of Gerstner waves , vertex shading and overall simulation models.<br />2) Fire in the Vulcan.  This effect was &quot;Inspired by the Balrog creature in &lt;I&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/I&gt; movies, our goal was to display a monster that would be the source of raging flames...&quot;  Different variations of this theme have been around for a while and just about any gamer will be familiar with it.  It's much more complex than the previously mentioned effect, but it's also more much compelling.<br />3) Shadow Mapping.  Virtually every driving/racing game you've played employs extensive use of Shadow Mapping.  The book dedicates 3 Chapters (12, 13 &amp; 14) to the subject and it's discussion is superb.  While I don't personally find this the most interesting topic, it's probably the best written area of the book.<br />4)  Glow - Very Very cool.  The scenario is the Tron 2.0 video game, but it's absolutely amazing.  Although there was very little math here and the discussion was pretty much theory, I had a little (see a LOT) of difficulty re-creating the effects.  The code accompanying the book includes everything for the chapter, but recreating my Cityscape wasn't happening.  In all fairness though I was pretty excited with the effect and go into coding before reading it another time or two like I should have.<br />5)  One last really impressive area is Filtering.  There are many apps where the UI is important but ancillary nonetheless.  When I fire up XDesktop, I don't need everything pulsing and glowing doing neat stuff but eating up processor cycles.  On the other hand, video games better perform well and anything video centric better be smooth, fast and cool.<br />All in all I think this book is first rate. The effects absolutely rock, all of them are cool, and the picture quality in the book is superb.  Just about every cool effect you'll want to deal with it covered in depth here and you won't leave the table hungry.  I really can't emphasize enough though, this isn't a book for hobbyists.  Much of the text is written primarily in symbolic math grammar and some of the simpler math involves manipulating Jacobian matricies for instance.  If you want to really polish your graphics skills, this book is for you.It's much more complex than the previously mentioned effect, but it's also more much compelling.<BR>3) Shadow Mapping.

This book is essentially the technical documentation of the C# spec (covering the new framework enhancements like Generics), written by the guy that wrote it (and he writes books about as well as he creates languages).  There are plenty of good examples, but since it's a reference book more than anything else, you're not going to get 10 pages of examples on the more 'complex' subjects.  What you will get is clear and relevant information on how C# really works and and example or two to get you through it.<br />This is a lot different than the rest of the A-W Series, but it's a class act through and through.  And if you are a C# programmer or want to be one, this is a must have reference.	2004-02-23

I bought it when I was first learning ADO.NET and I really liked it.  I see that some other people have written some negative stuff about it, but I have to disagree.  The book isn't advertised as the definitive guide to ADO.NET.  And I think people new to ADO.NET or intermediate programmers wanting to refine their knowledge will really apprecaite it.  I know I sure did.<br />I've been following Mahesh for a while, love his web site and really like his books.  He's very methodical and uses good examples to back up his discussion. And if you are new to ADO.NET, Chand's writing is such that he won't lose you because he moves too fast and he won't bore you because he moves too slow.<br />I can't wait for his next title!	2004-02-23

Like their Hejlsberg title, this is pure reference.  However, there's a lot to it (almost 900 pages in total) and EVERYTHING in the CLS is covered here. It's very technical, and definitely not a cover to cover read, but there are many good examples and if you need a quick reference for any topic in the Framework, this book is a must have.	2004-02-23

So I'm probably quite biased but I think this book is really great.  It's written such that a total beginner could pick it up and get going, but there's a lot of great material intertwined that I think intermediate developers would enjoy it too.<br />My number one criteria for a book is that it's interesting.  I read the whole thing and never got bored even though I was already familiar with much of the material.  That's a big plus in my book.  The content is good and the examples are practical and well discussed.  On the other hand, I think he does a great job of discussing things in proportion to how important they are.  Let's face it, twenty examples of using the DataAdapter Configuration wizard is silly and there's a title or two out there that goes down that road.  This is what I really enjoyed because he shows you both ways of doing just about everything (using code or doing it with UI tools) and explains the what's and hows.<br />I've liked every book he's written and this is no exception.	2004-02-23

I thought I had already reviewed this book but I guess I didn't.  This is a totally killer book from start to finish.  There's simply nothing that isn't great about it.  It's well written and never gets boring.  Vaughn has a total command over what he writes and has an amazing knack for keeping things interesting (which is very important in computer books).  His examples are all things you encounter every day.  His insights are those of someone's who's dealt with virtually every scenario his readers  may face. And in a nutshell, it's just a totally cool book by a totally cool author.<br />I am an abject book nut and I ADO.NET is probably one of my favorite subjects.  With that said, I'm by default a huge fan of Mr. Vaughn but if you are going to do any ADO.NET programming, this is a must have title!	2004-02-23

Every single book in this series that I've read is just plain great.  This book, as well as their ASP.NET 2.0 title are just more examples of the same killer material they are publishing.<br />The book splits itself about 60/40 ADO.NET 2.0 Per se and the XML.  However, if you're familiar with ADO.NET, you'll know they are interdependent technologies in .NET (no, I'm not saying you can't use XML without ADO.NET but XML and ADO.NET are so intertwined in .NET,it's hard to talk about ADO without XML).<br />Anyway, there's little in the way of review for the way ADO.NET used to work, and Amen to that.  This book is short and too the point and you don't need to undestand pervious versions of ADO.NET to understand what's going on.  With that in mind, a long discussion of previous version would be a waste of space.  Now, there's no doubt that this book emphasizes Yukon and SqlServer features of ADO.NET 2.0, but it's not in any way limited to that.  The subject of Batch updates is very cool (I know I can't wait for 2.0 to be released) but it doesn't take a lot of explaining.  MARS and ObjectSpaces get a lot more coverage, but those are the two coolest features that I've seen.  Well, that's not entirely true, the bulk loading features and paging are pretty darnded cool too.<br />Then the book discusses Yukon and the only complaint I have here is that I can't get a copy of it!  You'll need Whidbey to compile the examples, but I've found getting a copy of Yukon to be quite elusive so that is somewhat limiting. However, that's not the author's fault in any way.  (However, if they want to include a copy of it with the next release of the book, it'd certainly be a nice touch).<br />After that it moves into the XML realm and it's very very cool.  No, it doesn't walk you through creating an XML document.  The focus is heavy on data extraction with XML, XPath, XQuery, XmlReader, XmlAdapter taking up the focus of the discussion.  Trust me, you'll be dying to play with this stuff by the time you get through the first discussion on it.<br />All in all, it looks like ADO.NET 2.0 is a larger evolution from previous versions than ADO.NET was to ADO (although ADO.NET is a totally different technology than ADO).  If you want to take advantage of these features, you're going to have some learning to do.  However, all of the books examples are complete, concise and clear and most importantly, they all work.  There's nothing worse than typos and broken code, but it's a lot worse when you are dealing with a technology this young.<br />Once again, another first rate job by A-W.ery, XmlReader, XmlAdapter taking up the focus of the discussion.

But even then I was still playing around with [Obsolete], [Serializable] and the more common ones.  Then I ran across the whole subject of declarative security and realized I had a Lot of learning to do.  Fortunately for me, this book eased the process.<br />The only thing I didn't like about it is that I wish there was a lot more of it. Most of the discussion of attributes that I've run across are either the 'canned' ones like what I mention above, or overly theoretical.  Too often I just couldn't see where they'd be applicable (more because of my thick head than any writer's deficiencies).  That's where this book really shines.  It starts out with your basic &quot;what's&quot; and &quot;why's&quot; but gets moving pretty quickly.  Another thing about this book is that it's a pretty advanced topic. Back in college, we were heavy into OOP, but I don't remember hearing about AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) and this is the first time I've really run across it.  I really wish there would have been some more on the subject, but they did a very good job explaining the subject.<br />There are many good examples in here and the text is very well written.  APress is pretty great about the quality of their stuff and this is no exception.	2004-02-23

As you may be aware, there aren't a whole lot of them out there, but they are all really good.  This one is no exception.  If you do much with .NET, then you probably know these authors already, and they lived up to their reputations with this one!<br />Why would you want this book?  Well, most importantly it really explains the Why's of Compact Framework development.  There really are a lot of considerations and while the CF is very similar to the full framework, there are a lot of differences.  As a developer, this book thoroughly explains what you are getting into and how to avoid many common mistakes.  However, even if you are a non-technical person this book will prove to be a great asset if you are involved in decision making.  After all, who wouldn't want a mobile presence for their company?  Well, like everything else, it comes with some strings attached.  In most instances they are trivial compared to what you get.  In others they may not be.  Architectural considerations are critical because you are dealing with limited battery life, smaller processors and memory and reduced real estate.  It's also a lot easier to lose a PDA than it is a desktop and since many of the advantages of using Handhelds are only realized when you have wireless access, issues like bandwidth and security can make or break any mobile initiative.<br />I think the best part of this book is its theoretical focus.  It's very easy to run off and start coding, forgetting architectural concerns.  In these instances, many find that getting a great little app that works great in a test environment isn't so good once you get it into production.  This book can help you minimize the chances of that happening.  Furthermore, it gives you a very sober perspective on what you will need to deal with.  Due to the fact that the CF has only been commercially released for under a year, and PDA development hasn't been a practical reality for more that a few years, there just isnt' that much literature out there.  And this book's focus on architectural issues and HOW TO Deal with them effectively will prove how hip the authors really are.<br />I've been really impressed with the recent direction of AW and they've been pumping out some really great titles.  Couple a good publisher with some really informed and talented writers and you have a winner.  Undoubtedly, this book is a winner.a practical reality for more that a few years, there just isnt' that much literature out there.

After a developer works through the initial learning curve of .NET, they'll usually want to learn how to do things better.  If 'better' is defined as coding totally reusable code, then this book is for you.<br />It might sound silly, but a lot of time you think you are reusing code only to learn that you really aren't.<br />Three parts really stick out about this book (but that's not to say that the other chapters aren't as good).<br />1) Security -  Yes, the ultimate pain in the butt for developers but an increasingly important topic these days.  In all honesty, if you don't want to pay attention to security, then you probably will end up with some serious egg on your face at some point.  This alone justifies the price of the book.<br />2)  Events- You can't do much in .NET without getting into events.  I will say that his discussion probably caters to more advanced developers, but Events are not a topic for beginners.  I really loved this section and I think he makes some superb points and makes them very clearly.<br />3)  Threading- Threading isn't for the weak of heart, and you will not learn how to use it effectively without making a few messes first.  However, he does a great job of warning you of the pitfalls and explaining why they are pitfalls.  If you are going to do any serious development in .NET, you'll need to understand the threading library.  If you are coming from VB 6 (where writing good multithreaded apps was VERY PAINFUL) this will really help you with it.<br />4)Remoting -  This subject has entire books written on it.  While this book is by no means the definitive guide on Remoting, it's discussion is very relevant and will definitely pique your interest in the subject.  To be honest, I was 'too busy' learning other stuff to worry about remoting until I read this book.  Then I felt like an idiot for ignoring it for so long.  This book made me want to learn it and got me through the rough part of my learning curve, particularly in respect to component development.<br />Well, there's 30 other reasons to buy this book, but I only have 1,000 words..... but I can assure you that if you buy it, you'll be glad you did.ing curve, particularly in respect to component development.<br />Well, there's 30 other reasons to buy this book, but I only have 1,000 words..... but I can assure you that if you buy it, you'll be glad you did.	2003-11-21

I've since done a 180 and have really grown to like them.  This book is one of the reason's why.  I'm a big fan of the Authors and bought it just because I try to read every ADO.NET title that I can get my hands on, and try to buy everything MacDonald writes.<br />The book is concise and too the point.. It's not a definitive reference to ADO.NET (If you haven't bought David Sceppa's book or Bill Vaughn's --- buy those two and this one!) but it's a very practical how to guide for a lot of common tasks.  If you are familiar with Matt's stuff, it's very typical of his style.  I think he's one of the more interesting writers out there and this book keeps your attention.  I'm an ADO.NET nut, so I'm highly opininated on such literature, but this book really lived up to my expectations.<br />Basically, if you are looking for a concise and very 'to the point' book on ADO.NET, particularly if you have a decent understanding of the technology, you'll be glad you bought this book.  I have bought and loved every title MacDonald has written, and this book is a great example of why.	2003-11-21

I read Dino's articles in MSDN religously, and love his stuff.  I bought his book based on his name alone and as I expected, it's great.<br />The style of this book is exactly the same as his stuff in MSDN.  If you aren't familiar with it, I mean that advanced users will love it b/c it's always interesting and practical, but if you are a newbie, it's clear and understandable so it'll be great for you too.<br />If you aren't an ASP.NET developer, then there's a lot to learn.  ASP.NET represents a fundamental shift in thinking (what in .NET doesn't?) but if anything, it's much simpler and intuitive than ASP ever could be.  I've played with all of the code in this book and everything compiled and worked as expected.  The examples are all things that you'll probably confront in your day to day development and Dino gets right to the heart of the issue.<br />He's unquestionably one of the greatest minds in .NET and he is a superb communicator.  One of the best features of this book is that it never gets boring and it never skips important details that leave you wondering how to do what he's talking about.  I know this sounds petty, but coming up with real examples that aren't silly or overly complex (and always relevant) takes a lot of skill.<br />If you don't read his articles in MSDN - then start, you'll be glad you did.

Example after Example after Example of just cool stuff, with great implementations, cleary written x25.<br />There's a lot to ASP.NET and I think you need to read more than a few books before you really 'get' it, but if you are developing professional ASP.NET apps, this book pays for itself by the time you hit page 30.<br />If you aren't into 'cookbooks' and you want an academic discussion of ASP.NET, then this book isn't for you.  However, if you want some great practical examples, you'll fall in love with this book quickly.	2003-11-21

When I got Jeffrey Richther's Microsoft .NET Framework book, I was convinced no one was going to outdo him.  Well, it's a close call, but I think they are both Superb books by excellent authors.  I've purchased Don's stuff before and really liked it.  This book lived up to its expectations.<br />I think his ability to communicate some of the more obscure areas of the CLR in a very clear matter is what makes this book shine.  This book can be understood by anyone because of the writer's gift for writing...but that's not to say it's a novice's book.  Wherever you are in the .NET learning curve, there's something for you in this book.<br />If you really want to learn the CLR, this is a great place to start.	2003-11-20

However, the author did a bang up job.  I agree with the other reviewer that his discussions on using Web.Config and the asp account are hardly ever mentioned but very important.<br />Most importantly, this book is very readable.  That's not the case with many ASP.NET books.  His command of ASP.NET is great, his examples are all really cool.  The guy knows his stuff and definitely knows how to communicate it to you.<br />I liked it so much that I will definitely buy the next book with his name on it, he's a great writer!	2003-11-20

Lot's of practical information, that's well written, easy to use and interesting.  There are a lot of books on manipulating WinForms and I've liked most of what I read.  For someone to write on a well discussed subject and make it cool and interesting takes some talent, and Chris does just that!	2003-11-20

This book however, does not have that shortcoming.<br />The thing about this book that is so compelling is that you really get into building web services and consuming them, and its done in a  way that is very practical and useful.<br />There's the standard explanation of the things, but he never gets all into the hype at the expense of content.<br />I think it's geared toward people with a basic understanding of web services, but even if you don't have that, if you walk through his examples, you'll get there quickly.<br />I will definitely buy anything else that he puts out.  He's a great writer and communicator.	2003-11-20

Every time I buy a Matthew MacDonald book, I can't wait to go get another one.  The guy is a true master of writing and programming.<br />I liked everythign about this book.  It was easy to read, very interesting, filled with great examples and just all around excellent.<br />If you want to start building your own controls, for sale or just for personal use, get this book.  There are a lot of great UI books out there, this is definitely one of them....but Matthew outdid himself again.<br />Absolutely Wonderful!	2003-11-20

I'm an ADO.NET junkie and while the author did a pretty good job on it.  His command of the material is excellent but my only complaint is that the whole thing was kind of dry.  (Not saying I could do any better).  Maybe it's just because I've read just about everything I can find on ADO.NET before I read this, but I just didn't get the feeling that there was much new material or that he presented any new ways of looking at things.<br /><br />With that said, it's a thorough discussion of ADO.NET and he doesn't leave anything out.  It's definitely a good reference book and even though I 'say' I'm somewhat disappointed, the book is definitely a 4 overall, and as far as technical content goes, it's cleraly a five.  Ahh honestly, it's a five.	2003-11-20

Well, his book is really cool and typical of Matt's work.  The book is geared toward mid level developers, but I think beginning developers will save themselves a lot of 'learning curve' time by reading it, and advanced developers will certainly appreciate many of the concepts he puts forth.  There are many things that in it that are every day tasks, but I totally disagree with the reviewer that said there's not much new in this book.  As far as a cookbook goes, there is going to be some common stuff in it.  That's what it's all about.  There are many tasks that most every program entails.  But Matt has some great implementations and there is a ton of stuff that I really doubt every developer already knows.  I've recommended this book to two of my friends, and while they are both C# developers, they both really liked it.  Go ahead and pick up a copy, you'll like it.	2003-11-16
US	36902210	R22RBZ56MTKQZN	0782142427	708573629	Visual Basic .NET Power Tools	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A really cool book for advnaced developers	I just picked up a copy of this book and was really surprised.  Many books seem geared toward advanced development, but often fall short.  This one certainly didn't.<br />there are a lot of cool things covered here, but the two most striking ones are the coverage of Message Queues and Security.<br />I just got into advanced messaging and there's not a lot of documentation out there.  If you want to learn it, you used to have to stumble around until you got it right.  Their coverage of the subject changes all of that.  It explains messaging in depth and has many practical exapmles.  In addition, it walks you through many of the common 'gotchas' you'll encounter when developing message based apps.<br />Another great area is security.  I know in my experience, I was too busy learning .NET to really focus on security.  That's like being in too much of a hurry to put gas in your car.  i wish I would have realized this earlier.  They discuss just about every practical aspect of security and have a lot of great examples as well.<br />These are my two favorite parts of the book, but there are many more.  They explain Regular Expression for example and have tons of useful examples in it. They have a great GREP utility example that just about any developer will really enjoy.<br />I've bought Petroutsos' other book and really enjoyed it...and history repeated itself with this one.	2003-11-16

I read his column monthly in MSDN and have the utmost of respect for him.<br />This book is why I feel like I do. XML is everything in .NET and you can't afford to ignore it.  I guess technically you can, but you'll really be limiting yourself.  Dino knows his stuff and can really explain it well.  He writes articles all the time, and his ability to communicate is rivaled only by his knowledge of the material.<br />i could go on and on about it, but there's too much to say to do it justice.  So let me sum it up in one sentence.  If you want program in .NET and you want to do it well, this book belongs in your library!	2003-11-16

I have to admit, I'm a bit biased in regard to Mr. Connell.  His bought on Coding techniques is one of my favorites of all, and I have a lot of .NET books.  He has the incredible ability to make reading his stuff fun and get you thinking.  He never goes off on tangents and really knows how to communicate his material.<br />Creating controls is certainly something most developers will have to do...many times you have to do it a bunch.  He has created many controls that I have myself (although he has some more interesting implementations), but the &quot;Why&quot; behind it really gets you thinking.  he also has a lot of controls I never thought of, but have put into practice already.  I had the book  for about an hour before I put it down b/c I saw a ton of places to use his ideas in an app I was working on.<br />Then he makes the case for component based programming in general.  Sure, we all know we should re-use stuff.  But many of us get in a hurry and forget to build things specifically with re-use in mind.  I wont' make that mistake again.<br />I can't say enough about this book, but you'll definitely like it.  After i got a copy of it, the rest of my department eventually got a copy b/c everyone wanted to borrow it because of it's killer content.  Everyone else shared my sentiments.<br />I only wish John would quit his day job and write more books, few people do it as well as he does.	2003-11-16

I've been developing .NET apps for just about two years since beta 1 and really wish this book was around when I first started.  The only thing I can say bad about it is that I would have liked it before I spent a lot of time trial-and-erroring my way through things.  I can't blame the authors though, books this cool take a while to write!<br />It's really a cool layout and and you feel yourself caught in the momentum.  Example after example and very concise and to the point.  Few books make their point(s) so quickly and succinctly.  Not a lot of fluff or general comments (which certainly belong in many books), but it really gets to the point on each and every example.  I found it very easy to read, it made me want to read on, it was very well written and all of the code worked flawlessly.<br />If you are starting out in .NET, this book will save you HOURS, and in many instances, DAYS and perhaps weeks.  If you are an experienced developer, there is still a lot that you may have not come across yet and this book will certainly have some great information for you.<br />I've never purchased anything by Sean or Campbell, but if this is any indication of their work, I'll definitely be buying whatever else they write.	2003-11-16

It was like getting kicked in the stomach, not because it was wrong, but because it was right.  It made me fundamentally re-think how I write my code and really shifted my whole mental image.  Too many times developers think that if an app does what users want and runs fast and is reliable, that's all there is to it.  Not anymore.  The most killer app written wouldn't impress anyone if it got hacked and cost them a lot of money.  There days, too many people are trying to hack your stuff, and having your app busted is no less 'bad' than having a logic flaw miscalculate tons of money.  Moreoever, security breaches often make the headlines so it's a lose/lose for everyone if your security is breached.<br />The good news... buy this book, follow their guidelines religously, keep up to date with security issues, and sleep easy at night.	2003-11-16

Both of the authors are gifted writers and active contributors to the development community.<br />If you are a CF developer, you'll want to get this book ASAP.  Of the current literature, much of which is good, this book is an excellent compliment.  YOu don't need to have been an evB or eVC++ developer to really get a lot from it.  It has a tremendously down to earth tone to, but doesn't gloss over the more complex topics.  CH17 on the MessageWindow alone with worth the price of the book.  It's a pretty hefty guide, loaded with examples, and you get two different perspectives from two guys who both know their art and know how to communicate it.  The examples that they use will defintely inspire you to implement many of them in your own apps.  I can think of at least 6 topics that they cover in depth, and supply code for, that I see questions about in the newsgroups every day.<br />I liked this book so much that I left my original copy at my girlfriends house (who lives out of town) and couldn't wait, so I bought another copy---and I still got the information for a fraction of what's its done for me.	2003-10-18

However, this book had wonderful examples of real world things you do with forms.  The writing is great, the layout is very easy on the eyes, and whether you are using it for a reference, or trying to get new ideas from it...you'll be glad you bought this book.	2003-09-28

I really liked the way the book read, it was very clear and I don't remember ever feeling like I didn't 'get' what I had just read.  His discussion on ASP.NET was one of the better parts of the book.  It was more heavily weighted to ASP.NET's background info ie what's really happening behind the scenes, but ASP.NET is so different from old school ASP, that I think it was a great discussion.  Every book I've got from the Wintellect crowd has pleased me, and this one is no exception.	2003-09-28

This isn't exactly a guide beginners guide on class design, nor is it an experts book..but it does one thing very well, if you are new to VB.NET or .NET and you know what you want your classes to do, this book will show you how to accomplish it.  Moreover, there are some good examples and it can get you thinking in different directions.<br />They were a little skimpy on issues like using Properties vs. Public Variables (and if you move to .NET, you will have to fight VB6 programmers clinging on to bad habits of the past), but overall, I think the book does a great job at what it advertises itself to be.<br />Also, the discussion on Delegates and event handling was particularly helpful if that's your interest.	2003-09-28
