In the time of William the Conqueror, two people sworn to hate forged a love so strong it would overcome any obstacle. Thus is the story of Wulfgar and Aislinn.  <br /> <br />_The Wolf and the Dove_ is a tale full of passionate love and bitter war all set amid scenery so well described you feel that you are transported to another time and place. You'll feel as though you walk the footpaths and as if you are part of the action. Ms. Woodiwiss has a rare talent to join words together that makes them seem as if they come to life.  <br /> <br />The characters are vibrant and well fleshed out. The interaction between the characters is some of the best I've ever seen. Their wit is matched well against each other and it makes for *very* enjoyable scenes. Wulfgar is infuriating and exasperating and even though he tries to hide it you can sense a tenderness buried deep under the surface. There are glimpses of a little boy inside of him seeking love. That said, he still remains a mystery. Most times you can't figure out what he's thinking, which makes him all the more appealing. You respect him for not immediately forcing himself upon Aislinn. It is quite humorous to watch him struggle with his feelings for Aislinn while at the same time still trying desperately to cling to his hatred of women. Aislinn is one of the finest examples of a romantic heroine. She is brave, passionate and often sets the hero on his ear.  <br /> <br />_The Wolf and the Dove_ is a lively story that will keep you turning the pages quickly and never wanting it to end. A fine example of Ms. Woodiwiss at her all-time best.	2004-10-08

Rules were made to be broken, and Iphiginia Bright teaches Marcus, Earl of Masters, to break all of his in this lovely book by Amanda Quick. As always, Ms. Quick delivered a sound story with wonderfully three dimensional characters who brought the plot to vivid life. The premise of the story was unique and refreshing, even for Amanda Quick who is the Queen of new and invigorating ideas.  <br /> <br />But, what made this story so spectacular were the characters. Marcus and Iphiginia are both forthright, stubborn, obstinate and highly intelligent and watching them try to outwit one another is a riot! They have so much in common and draw from the same sorts of life experiences. It's a joy to see Marcus grow throughout the book from a hard, unloving automaton to a man who loves Iphiginia to distraction. It is a touching change and by the end of the book you'll love Marcus even more than you did at the beginning. Iphiginia is one of the best historical heroines I've ever seen. She is bold, daring, and audacious while being quite caring and feminine. She accomplishes what every woman wants -- to be the equal of a man while retaining the very things that make her a woman. The banter between Iphiginia and Marcus is some of the best dialogue Ms. Quick has ever written -- *very* entertaining!  <br /> <br />Once again, the mystery becomes the driving force for the story. Just when you think you have everything figured out -- think again! There are many twists and turns to this plot that will keep you guessing and riveted on the edge of your seat. I laughed, cried and cheered aloud! I'm sure people must have thought me daft! This is quite possibly my favorite book by Ms. Quick, which is saying a lot -- I've loved everything I've ever read by her. If you read only one book by Ms. Quick, make it this one -- you won't be disappointed.	2004-10-08

Being an ardent fan of time-travel romances, I started this book thinking it would be like all the rest -- heroine stumbles upon entrance to the past-meets good looking hero-falls in love-decides to give up modern conveniences for hero. Though _Son of the Morning_ did contain these elements to some extent, it was much more of a heroine-on-the-run-from-thugs sort of book. Regardless of this, I was enthralled from the first chapter.<br /><br />Grace St. John is an extremely well developed character. She is a normal, average woman who, when faced with extreme situations shows bravery, courage and strength of will that under normal circumstances would have been foreign to her. You immediately feel as if you're on the run with Grace, you grieve with her, feel frightened when she does and silently cheer when she perseveres. Linda Howard did an excellent job fleshing out this character and making her come to life for the reader.<br /><br />The plot is well thought out and engaging, keeping you interested right from the first. There are quite a few twists and turns that will keep you absorbed as you try to figure out the intricacies of the plot.<br /><br />I did have a few problems with the book, however, thus causing me to only give it four stars. It would deserve five had a few things been resolved. Though termed a romance novel, I didn't feel there was quite enough romance included to justify that classification. I was left wanting at the end, thirsting for more interaction between the hero and heroine. Most of my feelings of disappointment stem from the fact that the hero and heroine only meet roughly 100 pages before the book ends. I'm accustomed to having more time with characters, seeing how they grow and love together. I did like the supernatural connection between Grace and Niall that made them aware of each other before they'd ever met -- it brought a feeling of depth to their love that would have been missing had that aspect not been included. Most of all, I don't feel the character of Niall was explored enough. The reader spends an enormous amount of time with Grace, getting to know her, feeling with her -- but is only given what feels like a glimpse of Niall. He is a remarkable character, sensual, brave, and strong and I feel cheated that I wasn't given the chance to know him more.<br /><br />I can only hope that Ms. Howard plans to write again of Grace and Niall. Both of these characters deserve another book where their love can be explored. If you're looking for an adventurous book with murder and mayhem around every corner, _Son of the Morning_ will probably suit you fine. However, if you're searching for a romance novel that will take you on a journey of feelings, you should probably look elsewhere. Don't misunderstand me, I really enjoyed the book, it just wasn't quite what I was expecting.l, I don't feel the character of Niall was explored enough.

Christened The Beast of Blackthorne Hall, it is said Gideon Westbrook, Viscount St. Justin, ravished and caused the suicide of a country rector's daughter. With a scarred face to match his marred reputation, all and sundry feared Gideon, all that is, except Harriet Pomeroy. Seeking aid to protect her sacred caves, Harriet turns to the most powerful land owner in the district, unaware of his insidious past. Together they form a bond that sets Society on it's ear and has the whole 'ton' talking in Amanda Quick's _Ravished_.  <br /> <br />I am a firm believer in Amanda Quick's talent to shape characters that are not only three dimensional but people you'd feel privileged to know. In _Ravished_ she creates the finest characters of her career. Gideon will touch your heart. It is difficult to put into words just what you will feel for Gideon. While he is domineering, headstrong, and arrogant on the surface, beneath his confident facade lurks a man who has endured more physical and emotional pain than anyone should be forced to experience. The instant you meet Gideon, you know, just as Harriet knows, that he is incapable of the vile things people claim he did. He is kind, giving and the very epitome of a true gentleman. Harriet is a tyrannical bluestocking who has just the right flare to tame the Beast. She is honorable, noble and you instantly love the way she guards and protects Gideon. It is charming to watch her spar with the people who would smear Gideon's name.  <br /> <br />While the romance is the main focus of this book, Ms. Quick adds just the right amount of humor and mystery to keep things interesting. There were quite a few places I found myself laughing aloud! The main thing I loved about this book though, was the fact that both the hero and the heroine *need* each other. Gideon makes Harriet feel beautiful and Harriet heals the wounds that impair Gideon's soul. As always, I was more than pleased in my selection. _Ravished_ will be a book I visit very, very often.	2004-10-08

I am continually amazed by the quality of Harlequin Historical Romances. Each one I've read has been marvelous and Lyn Stone's _The Arrangement_ is of the same high quality that has impressed me before.  <br /> <br />Her characters are three dimensional and have such depth that they come to life right before your eyes. Kathryn has a Lois Lane-like impetuosity and tons of tenacity mixed with a vulnerability that touches your heart. Jonathan is without a doubt a musical genius -- thus he is exceedingly arrogant, perplexing and exasperating. He has an underlying sensuality that fairly seeps from his pores and he is quite mysterious.  <br /> <br />I adored the aspect of Jonathan's musical gift, it was a wonderful plot device that I'd never seen before. It added feeling to the story while bringing the characters closer together.  <br /> <br />The passion between Kathryn and Jonathan is explosive and is immediately evident when they meet. You'll be quite dazzled by these two characters who are so perfect for each other.  <br /> <br />Ms. Stone has written a gem of a book that will call for repeated readings. _The Arrangement_ is an absolutely delightful, beautiful story -- I savored every word!	2004-10-08

At first it seems a bit far fetched, but after a while you do get caught up in the magic and the romance of two lovers who were destined to be together. Though it gets off to a slow start, about midway through the book the action picks up and things start falling into place and making sense. The only thing I had trouble with was the fact that there are quite a few scene changes that aren't indicated by anything but a new paragraph -- these made for some very confusing moments. It's a fun, quick read, though not quite as good as some of the other 'More Than Men' books.	2004-10-07

Though I don't usually read Harlequins, I've always really enjoyed the 'More Than Men' series of books they publish. _Neptune's Bride_ is one of the best I've read from this series! Not only does it give an interesting explanation for the Bermuda Triangle phenomenon, it has two wonderful characters who play well off each other. Jase is wildly sexy and mysterious and Geneva is so funny as the scientist who tries to analyze the unexplainable. And, the sea creatures with their *very* unique personalities will leave you smiling! I was hooked from the first. It pulled me right in and wouldn't let go.

Bah Humbug -  <br /> <br />The first of three stories in this anthology, _Bah Humbug_ is a charming little tale reminiscent of Scrooge. Nate, an over-worked ad executive is fed up with Christmas and the endless number of decorations and hoopla that fairly scream, \\"You must love Christmas! You must love Christmas!\\" What he needs is a little Christmas cheer to pick him up. He finds that in his neighbor, Milly. She's like Ms. St. Nick -- totally devoted to all things Christmas but she doesn't have anyone to share it with. Nate's sense of humor will leave you in stitches and Milly's a hoot with her oversized joy of Christmas. They're completely opposite but so well suited for each other I was grinning from ear to ear. But, it isn't all wine and roses, sparks fly when these two get together! The ending will make you cry! Ms. Greenwood has a wit to her writing that is thoroughly refreshing. This story will have me searching for her other work. I really got a lot out of this little story. It was a great read and I'll be picking it up again come Christmas. <br /> <br />Christmas Present -  <br /> <br />A cute quick read, this one didn't quite catch my attention like the first one. A story of old hometown rivals heats up with romance amid advice from a wizened old man that seems to know everyone in town. Starts off slow but does get better toward the end. <br /> <br />Blue Christmas -  <br /> <br />What woman hasn't dreamed at least once in her life of being swept away by a wildly sexy musician? Jess lives the dream in this cute story by Linda Winstead. It'll make you cry and laugh and urge you to latch on to what you feel is right even if you think you shouldn't. Right on par with the first story, _Blue Christmas_ is a feel-good tale rather reminiscent of _It's a Wonderful Life_. It'll make you cry more than once and it'll make you feel warm and cozy no matter the time of year. <br /> <br />All in all, _Christmas Spirit_ is a remarkable little book filled with lovely Christmas tales. Suitable to read anytime, I'm sure I'll pull it out often and give it a read through again -- but I will also make sure to read it every Christmas to put myself in the Christmas mood.	2004-10-07
US	17683585	RVCPFK83157NF	055329315X	4390139	Reckless	Books	5	19	20	N	N	Another winner from Amanda Quick!	_Reckless_ is the captivating tale of an impetuous heroine and a hero who appears cold at times but is really a romantic at heart. Ms. Quick always delivers a unique premise and a wonderful break from the mainstream romance. _Reckless_ is no exception. She wields a tale full of romance, mystery and danger while keeping a working balance between all the elements. The result is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat and up until the wee hours of the morning.  <br /> <br />I love the way she always seems to tie her characters together with some sort of shared history. It gives a feeling of destiny to the books. Ms. Quick's characters are always well developed and three dimensional. The main characters in this book are some of the best! Phoebe is very admirable. Right away you like her spunk and you can identify with her love of romance. You'll also laugh uproariously at her fashion sense. Gabriel is . . . hard to explain. One moment he endears himself to your heart and the next instant you'd like to throttle him. They are not only well suited to each other but also play well off one another. The interaction is entertaining and endearing.  <br /> <br />Also, in the form of secondary characters, you have Phoebe's charming family. A group of oddly hilarious socialites who try to keep the adventurer of the family, Phoebe, under control. They don't realize that they all possess a good portion of Phoebe's impetuosity. <br /> <br />All in all it was an excellent read, which is what I always expect from Amanda Quick.	2004-10-07

And so many other words I can't even list them all! _Horizons_ grabbed me right from the first page and wouldn't let go. It has everything you could possibly want in a story -- adventure, romance, intrigue and danger lurking around every corner. The plane crash and subsequent events were very true to life. Ms. Hart delivers a well-rounded group of characters who all have their own *very* distinct personalities. Using this cast of lovable, delightful rag-tags she lets you see how many people react to adversity in so many different ways. I finished the entire thing in one day -- I simply couldn't put it down. I was riveted and on the edge of my seat with each turn of the page. You'll enjoy every minute of your time with Kelly, Zach, Blair, Alita, Gavin, Sydney and the others. But you'll especially get caught up in the romance between Kelly and Zach and you'll rejoice as they discover love amid the danger and tragedy and as life blossoms where there was so much devastation.

Though listed as a 'Futuristic Romance,' it comes off as more of a sci-fi/futuristic story with a tad of romance thrown in for good measure. I would have given it five stars had it played up the romance more, since that was what I was looking for. Don't get me wrong, you'll get a good dose of romance spattered throughout the story and a good bit of heavy romance toward the end of the story, you'll just wish there had been more of it since the characters played so well off each other. Both Ashley and Garick are believable and very easy to care for. Building on a unique premise I haven't seen before, Ms. Casto paints a true-to-life picture of how our world could very easily end up. She also throws in some much needed lessons about how we should treat our planet while we still have the chance. Though, it's quite possible she's left it open for a sequel -- one can only hope -- _The New Frontier_ is a great book by itself and one that will go in my library for a future read if for no other reason than her highly interesting take on 'mail order brides.' Give it a read -- it's one of the better ones I've read from this genre.	2004-10-07

Having enjoyed nearly all of Ms. Lindsey's work, I was vastly disappointed with _A Gentle Feuding_. It seemed to be missing a bit of the polish I usually associate with Johanna Lindsey's books. It was not as descriptive as I would have liked. I much prefer being transported to new and wonderful places through the words of an author. Lindsey usually accomplishes this commendably but her talent for the descriptive was missing in this book.  <br /> <br />Also, the characters were shallow, not well developed and came off flat. Sheena seemed preoccupied with her looks, almost to the point of being narcissistic. I didn't like her attitude toward her sisters at all. She repeatedly stated that they are plain and that she is everyone's favorite, trying unsuccessfully to cover up her superficiality by bemoaning how her looks are such a burden. It just gave me the impression of someone who was entirely too full of herself. Granted, the sisters are not all that pleasant, but one has to wonder if this doesn't stem from the fact that Sheena boasts of her better looks and that she is quite certain she is the favorite of everyone she meets. I would rather a beautiful heroine not be aware of her beauty. Jamie, I'm sad to say, is not much better. He's also full of himself and even seems to have an underlying cruelty. He comes across as hard, unyielding and arrogant.  <br /> <br />By the end of the book I didn't really care what happened to either of them but I did feel that they deserved each other. If you're looking to find Lindsey at her best, try the Viking trilogy, the Malory saga, or the Ly-San-Ter series. This receives three stars only because it is Lindsey and the fact that everyone is entitled to an off day.	2004-10-07

Teeming with the usual mystery, romance, adventure and passion readers have grown to love, _With This Ring_ is right on par with all of Ms. Quick's earlier works. I'd even go so far as to say it has become one of my favorites by her.  <br /> <br />In Beatrice and Leo Ms. Quick has created two strong minded, mature and well rounded characters. Beatrice is lively, funny and intelligent. I really enjoyed reading about a heroine who was nearing thirty years old and who'd been wed and bed before. It was a nice, refreshing change of pace to see an older heroine who had a sensible head on her shoulders be swept away by desire. So many times romance authors inundate you with simpering beauties whose only attribute worth mentioning is their looks. Ms. Quick continually sets forth heroines who make you proud to be a woman and Beatrice does just that. Leo is exciting, sensual and has a magnetism that the reader feels right along with Beatrice. Watching him fall in love with Beatrice is a beautiful experience and when he gave her the legendary 'Mad Monk' token of love I cried.  <br /> <br />As always, the plot was engaging and full of twists and turns that kept me absorbed right from the first. Another thing I really enjoyed about _With This Ring_ is the fact that Ms. Quick alludes to a character from one of her previous books. It was nice to see a name I recognized and be able to recall another extraordinary book of her's that I'd read.  <br /> <br />Anyone who has read this book and didn't like it should give it a second read through, surely you must have missed something the first time! Anyone who hasn't read this book -- what are you waiting for? Buy it now and be prepared for a marvelous read courtesy of Amanda Quick.	2004-10-07
US	17683585	R8GF1CFJW87H9	0671516922	885092842	Trust Me	Books	5	33	35	N	N	Stunning!	Being a devoted Amanda Quick fan, I've decided to look up all her many incarnations. I decided on _Trust Me_ as my first foray into her titles written as Jayne Ann Krentz and was well pleased with the selection.  <br /> <br />The characters in this book are amazing -- every single one of them! Desdemona is one of the best romantic heroines I've seen. She is sharp, witty and has just enough edge to make her real. Sam is the perfect counterpart to Desdemona. He is brilliant yet so unsure of himself. He needs love and it is touching to watch Desdemona take him in and teach him about real trust and the true meaning of love and family. He also has the most irresistible tendency to just blurt out exactly what he's thinking. His forthrightness is sexy and refreshing. These two have such explosive chemistry and such witty banter that the pages fly by and soon you're at the end of the book before you've even realized it has begun.  <br /> <br />Not only are the main characters remarkable, the secondary characters are great! Desdemona's family -- theater people who are all named after characters in Shakespeare's plays -- are hilarious, charming and endearing. Also, Sam's brothers are cute and early on give you insight to the underlying aspects of Sam's personality.  <br /> <br />There is a mystery that comes into play mid-way through the book that drives the plot and expounds upon Desdemona's and Sam's relationship.  More than anything though, the driving force of this book is the romance between Desdemona and Sam. Their's is a tender, turbulent love that warms the heart.  <br /> <br />_Trust Me_, my first by Jayne Ann Krentz, will certainly not be my last. It is evident that under whatever pseudonym, Krentz or Quick, this lady has talent. I highly recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed work by Amanda Quick or to anyone who is looking for a fresh, enjoyable contemporary romance with memorable characters and a romance that is outstanding!	2004-10-07

After reading the hoards of flat reviews for Amanda Quick's _I Thee Wed_ I was expecting a horrendous book that had not even an inkling of Ms. Quick's obvious talent. I was certainly surprised to find that _I Thee Wed_ had the same flare that I've become accustomed to from Amanda Quick. <br /> <br />This book had me interested from the very first page! I don't usually become involved until at least two chapters have finished, but the very first page of this book started off with a bang. As always, Ms. Quick set forth a mystery that intrigued the mind and stirred the senses. Amid this mystery, Ms. Quick expertly tailored two characters that were both passionate, intricate and well developed.  <br /> <br />Emma is delightful! She is self-reliant, resolute and determined. She also was not quite as flighty as some of Ms. Quick's other heroines. Don't get me wrong, I really love all of Ms. Quick's heroines, but Emma struck me as the most level-headed and capable of all.  <br /> <br />Edison is a nice change from the usual brooding, dark heroes in Ms. Quick's books and seemed to have a devil-may-care twist to his personality. It was nice to see a man, who though haunted by his past, had overcome it and still held a love of life.  <br /> <br />Their relationship, though not quite as passionate as some, has a fairy-tale-like quality that is sweet and endearing. I loved that Emma and Edison were able to conduct a deep relationship outside of the bedroom. All too often romance authors lead you to the misconception that sex is all there is to love. Ms. Quick has never used this device, she always has her characters communicate on other levels besides the carnal and Edison and Emma pull this off quite amiably. I thoroughly believed that they loved each other and I enjoyed their chemistry.  <br /> <br />Once again, Ms. Quick alluded to a character from another of her books and I was elated! It's something she's only recently started and I hope she continues to do from now on.  <br /> <br />All in all, I was more than satisfied with _I Thee Wed_. It held all the magic and mystery that has made me an Amanda Quick fan. Please, if you've read this book and didn't like it, try it again -- you must have missed something the first time. Also, if you're one of the readers out there discouraged by the bland reviews, give it a try with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.	2004-10-07

Revenge is sweet, especially when it leads to love, as it does for Emily Faringdon and Simon Traherne, Earl of Blade, in _Scandal_ a phenomenal book by acclaimed Regency author Amanda Quick. _Scandal_ is a new and exhilarating twist for Ms. Quick. As opposed to the usual mystery that drives the plots of her books, we are presented with a matter of revenge.  <br /> <br />Forced long ago to flee his home, Simon Traherne harbors a dark and brooding hatred for the man who won that home in a frivolous card game -- Broderick Faringdon. In order to extract vengeance, Simon vows to wed the daughter of the man who ruined his life and destroyed his family.  Starting a correspondence with Broderick's daughter Emily, Simon spins a web of romance and love that leaves the whimsical and fanciful Emily powerless to resist his charms. Married for all the wrong reasons, Simon soon finds out that he got more than he bargained for in Emily. Her fierce love and devotion breaks the hard ice that covers his heart and shortly he finds himself in love with a member of the family he vowed would pay for his pain.  <br /> <br />Without fail, Amanda Quick always wields a tale so full of romance and adventure that it keeps the reader enthralled from the start and _Scandal_ is certainly not an exception. The characters are lively, witty and endearing. Simon is a dark, forbidding dragon and Emily is a charming, brilliant, and highly intelligent elf and together they heal each other and grow strength from their love. There is a great chemistry between Simon and Emily that fairly crackles from the pages. They are so completely different while being so much alike. Both were forced to grow up way too quickly and thus are the perfect match for one another. Emily's unfailing faith in Simon will touch your heart as she strives to prove that love is worth more than revenge.  I also really loved the symbolism of the dragons and the way Emily incorporates them into her wardrobe to display her absolute devotion to Simon for all to see.  <br /> <br />Though possibly not the book you should start with if you are a first-time Quick reader, _Scandal_ will invariably please the long-time fan as Ms. Quick's wit, style and talent reinforce the reason we love her books so much.	2004-10-07

Once again, Ms. Quick delivers characters who are so well suited for each other that they could only fall in love. Dubbed the Original and the Fallen Angel, Prudence and Sebastian are not defined by their monikers, but are defined by their unique and compelling personalities. Prudence is impulsive, persistent, and brave and Sebastian is dark, brooding, yet oh-so-gentle. These two meet and a love is forged that is at once beautiful and tumultuous. Sebastian has a penchant for growing bored easily, but Prue keeps him on his toes and always interested as she leads him on a merry chase. Watching Prue and Sebastian clash about what things are proper for a woman to do is vastly entertaining. It's also extremely funny how Sebastian confuses love with fondness while being profoundly jealous of other men's interest in Prue. For example, on the subject of a rather daringly cut gown, this exchange takes place: <br /> <br />_Prudence_, \\"My lord, are you implying that you do not care for my new gown?\\" <br /> <br />_Sebastian_, \\"What gown? I did not notice any gown on you tonight, madam. I thought perhaps you had forgotten to put it on before you left home.\\" <br /> <br />Ms. Quick's wit shines through in this novel as it does in all of her work and you'll find yourself laughing aloud. As always, the mystery of the novel is the driving force and this one was quite intriguing. It will keep you guessing until the very last pages. Once again, Ms. Quick presents a tale full of romance, mystery, and humor that will keep you turning the pages and wishing for more.	2004-10-07

I'm an avid Lindsey reader and am almost ashamed to admit that I passed by _So Speaks the Heart_ numerous times throughout the years without so much as a glance. It's been sitting on my bookshelf for as long as I can remember. I only pulled it out this time to pass the time on a *very* rainy day. Boy, was I surprised when I realized what an excellent book I'd found!  <br /> <br />The first thing that pulled me in was the setting. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was set in France. Having seen unlimited books that take place in England, this was an enjoyable change.  <br /> <br />Not only is the setting wonderful but the characters are vibrant, well developed, and engaging. Brigitte is brave, noble and kind and you feel quite sorry for her as she desperately tries to prove her identity. You become just as frustrated as she when Rowland refuses to believe who she is, especially since everyone else that meets her knows right away that she is of noble birth.  <br /> <br />Rowland, having been raised in an abusive household is arrogant, blind and domineering. You feel sorrow for the boy he must have been before his life was changed forever through the violence of his upbringing. He is unsure of how to respond to any kindness and in his ignorance of such soft emotions, lashes out at Brigitte as she doggedly tries to introduce him to love. You'll grow to love Rowland as you see him change into a kind and gentle man as Brigitte's love washes over him.  <br /> <br />And the surprise at the end will bring tears to your eyes! _So Speaks the Heart_ is a glimpse of Ms. Lindsey's work at the beginning of her career and her talent and mastery are well showcased. If you've been like me and looked over this gem of a book, please reconsider -- you won't be sorry!	2004-10-07

A search for buried treasure brings Jared Chillhurst and Olympia Wingfield together in _Deception_, a stunning book by Amanda Quick. A pleasant change from the normal Quick novel, _Deception_ is a story full of pirate's gold, soaring passions, and intriguing mystery. <br /> <br />As always, Ms. Quick has filled the tale with captivating, true-to-life characters. Jared has a quiet strength and a calm arrogance. He prides himself on not yielding to the extreme passions displayed by his hot-blooded family. But, the moment he meets Olympia, he turns into the very picture of a dangerous, exhilarating pirate. He is tempestuously sensual and wildly passionate. Olympia is quirky, whimsical and scatterbrained while being highly intelligent. Somewhat of a recluse and quite the wallflower, when she meets Jared she comes to vivid life. She blooms and grows under his love and by the end of the book turns into one of the most charming and likable heroines you'll ever meet. <br /> <br />In the usual Quick style, _Deception_ is peopled not only with excellent main characters, but secondary characters who almost steal the limelight.  Olympia's nephews are delightful and add a depth of warmth and feeling to the story while Jared's father and uncle are dashing, lively and spirited. <br /> <br />Not only is the story heart-warming and romantic, it may well be the funniest book Amanda Quick has written. At one point I very nearly fell in the floor I was laughing so hard. Once again I found myself caught up in a world created by Amanda Quick and it was a place I dearly loved. The plot is full of twists and turns and kept me transfixed the entire time. _Deception_ is a fine example of the reason Ms. Quick has become such a well-loved author. Her wit, talent and skill are present in every word and I felt privileged to be able to read them. _Deception_ is high on my list of favorites by Amanda Quick. Give it a read -- you won't be disappointed.	2004-10-06

I'm an avid Amanda Quick reader and usually can finish her books in two days while still functioning in life and doing the usual mundane day-to-day things. Such was not the case with _Mischief_, I absolutely *could not* put this book down -- I finished it in one day. Not only are the characters amazing, the plot moved along at such a wonderfully fast pace that I didn't even realize time was passing. I became absorbed in the story -- it was like I was watching a movie. The characters and scenery are so vivid that I felt like I was part of the story. It was as if I was peering over the shoulders of the main characters and experiencing the action right along with them.  <br /> <br />As always, Ms. Quick created characters that are captivating and dazzling. Matthias is dangerous, dark and mysterious. There is an air about him that is fascinating. He is the very picture of a heart-stopping hero. Imogen is charmingly clumsy. She is headstrong and unconcerned what Society thinks. Watching these two together was not only enchanting but intoxicating. They have an outstanding chemistry that bursts into life whenever they're together. I loved the way that Imogen always insisted upon leading whenever they danced and how it amused and frustrated Matthias. Also, Imogen's insistence that Matthias has delicate sensibilities is extremely funny!  <br /> <br />Unlike most readers, I had no problem with the talk of ancient Zamar. I saw it for what it was -- a plot device designed to move the story along and give the main characters something in common. I found lost Zamar quite interesting and bewitching and adored the added depth it gave to Matthias and Imogen's relationship. The very last scene will touch your heart and bring tears to your eyes!  <br /> <br />_Mischief_ was an outstanding experience and I highly recommend this book for either the long-time Amanda Quick fan or the first-time reader. _Mischief_ is a choice example of what Amanda Quick does so well.	2004-09-24

A second chance at love is worth fighting for as Matthew Farrell and Meredith Bancroft prove in this blissful book by Judith McNaught. This book will keep you riveted from the first! You'll experience so many emotions and such intense feelings -- love, hate, grief, joy, sadness, anger and frustration -- that when you're finished you'll feel like you've just stepped off an emotional roller coaster that left you wanting more. Remember to have a box of Kleenex handy when you begin -- you'll need them!  <br /> <br />Matthew and Meredith are some of the very best characters I've ever had the privilege to read about. They're true-to-life, three dimensional and so real that their emotions jump from the pages and weave themselves around you making the story come to life vividly. Matthew is the absolute definition of a romantic hero. Though hurt long ago by his true love he realizes he still wants her and does everything in his power to prove to her that they belong together. The way he stoically stands by his resolve to have Meredith for his own is beautiful. Though she feels betrayed by Matt, something inexplicably draws Meredith to him every time they meet. Watching Meredith burst free from the confines of her life that say she should not be with Matt is wonderful. The love between these two is explosive and oh-so-passionate! They have a deep and abiding love that even time and sordid lies could not kill.  <br /> <br />Ms. McNaught has a keen talent to make you experience her work and feel as if you've stepped into the story. Her secondary characters are just as fleshed out as her main characters and become quite real themselves. Meredith's father is a hard, bitter and selfish man who makes everyone's life miserable. I actually wanted to climb into the book and choke a fictional character!  <br /> <br />I really loved the way that Ms. McNaught showed the growth of her characters. Each character reshapes and expands throughout the book giving the reader a deeper insight into their personalities while keeping the characters genuine. By the end of the book Meredith's father even changes into someone half-way likable.  <br /> <br />I appreciated the look at Meredith's youth that gave insight into the things that shaped her as a woman and I also adored the look into the future of our couple.  <br /> <br />The plot was also outstanding -- I became engrossed in the business world that Ms. McNaught so realistically created. <br /> <br />I can't say enough good things about this book! My first by Judith McNaught that left me wanting to rush to the nearest bookstore and snatch up all her work. Don't be daunted by the length, this book will fly by and before you know it you'll be at the end. Don't forget to search up _Perfect_ by Ms. McNaught, I hear Meredith and Matt are mentioned in that book as well. Please don't hesitate to buy this book it's one of the best I've ever read.	2004-09-22

As always, the characters in this book are stunning! They are very dynamic and true-to-life and they are people you'd want to know. Cleo is a down-to-Earth woman with an underlying sensuality that she is desperate to bring forth. Max is successful in everything he tries, everything that is, except relationships. He is searching for a place he fits in. He finds that place in a remote inn known as the Robbins' Nest Inn. Robbins' Nest is peopled with a group of characters who call themselves 'the family' and are funny, warm and complex. These delightful denizens are headed up by the Inn owner, Cleo Robbins.  <br /> <br />Here, among these people, Max finds the love and acceptance he has been searching for all his life. Cleo and 'the family' take him in and add him to the bunch almost instantly. With their help he learns that being part of a family isn't about when you mess up, it's about being there. Watching Max break out of his shell and flourish under Cleo's love and the love of 'the family' is heartwarming.  <br /> <br />There is a mystery that plays throughout the book and unlike usual, I had half of it figured out almost instantly. The other part of the mystery, nevertheless, kept me guessing until the end.  <br /> <br />However, the mystery is not the driving force of this book as is most times the case. The tone of this story is definitely self-discovery. Watching Cleo and Max discover each other and learn things about themselves is wonderful.  <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The humor, the passion, and the love were touching and kept me interested right from the first. One of the best by Ms. Krentz in any of her many incarnations. I am always pleasantly surprised by the high quality and wonderful characters in Ms. Krentz's books. Buy this book now -- you won't be disappointed!	2004-09-16
US	17683585	RB7PD6Q0BKEOB	0553561537	840434615	Desire	Books	5	20	21	N	N	Breathtaking!	As any avid Amanda Quick reader knows, she usually sticks to the London 'ton' for her settings, but in _Desire_ she uses the middle ages as her backdrop and it is glorious! As is evident in all her works, Ms. Quick has a talent for bringing an atmosphere to life and such is definitely the case with _Desire_. The setting for this story is a remote British isle known as 'Desire' -- a land rich in flowers which thrives on the perfume trade that results from cultivating those blossoms. Ms. Quick describes the panorama so wonderfully that you will feel as if you can smell the endless fragrances of the isle.  <br /> <br />Not only is the scenery captivating, the characters are vibrant, lively and fascinating. Gareth is strong, brave and somber. When he arrives on the isle it is reputed that he never laughs. Clare is energetic, loyal and just exactly what Gareth needs to bring laughter into his life. Again, Ms. Quick delivers characters so well suited for each other that it is inevitable that they fall in love.  <br /> <br />As is always the case with Ms. Quick's work, _Desire_ is full of humor. This is clearly apparent in the scene following the wedding night -- it is classic and oh-so-funny! It had me very nearly rolling on the floor!  <br /> <br />Though not as prominent as in some of her stories, the mystery comes into play near the end and drives the book on to an exciting and touching finale. I was once again amazed by Ms. Quick's ability to snare a reader from the first and keep the story so exciting that it is impossible to stop reading.  <br /> <br />All in all, _Desire_ is a delightful gem of a story full of love, laughter and heady aromas that will leave you wanting more. Possibly the only thing that could have made this book more enjoyable would have been a glimpse into the future of our couple.  <br /> <br />If you're interested in seeing another book by Ms. Quick set in the middle ages, try _Mystique_. It is of the same high quality and showcases Ms. Quick'sflare to adapt to any setting be it the ton or medieval times.	2004-09-14
US	17683585	R2KQK75KUAX6ZD	0380756250	143694847	Once a Princess (Cardinia's Royal Family)	Books	5	109	116	N	N	Once upon a time . . .	Once upon a time there was a baby princess born in the small European country of Cardinia.  Her name was Tatiana Janacek and her father was the king.  Her life should have been an endless parade of balls, cotillions and fairy-tale dreams, but before her first birthday her world shattered.  Her entire family was killed in a blood-feud that destroyed the royal house of Cardinia and her own life was threatened before it even had a chance to begin.  So, the new king, Sandor, held a ceremony to betroth Tatiana to his son, Stefan, and then the only remaining Janacek was spirited away to the wilds of America.  Unfortunately, the bad luck she'd faced in Cardinia followed Tatiana to the new world and the woman who accompanied her on the harrowing journey died the moment they reached America.  Tatiana never had the chance to learn of her noble ancestry or even to know her own birthday.  Left in the care of a tavern-owner and his wife, Tatiana grew up as Tanya Dobbs.  In her formative years she suffered greatly at the hands of the man she believed to be her father.  Beatings and emotional abuse were Tanya's constant companions.  Now in her 20s, the man who abused her so grievously must depend on her for his care.  With his incapacitation, Tanya is finally able to take control of her life and the tavern where she was barely better than a slave will soon be hers.  Thus, the woman who should have been the queen of a country finally becomes ruler of her own destiny.    In the land of Cardinia, king Sandor's health is failing.  The rigors and responsibilities of ruling are taking their toll on him and he feels it would be in his country's best interest if he turns the reins over to his son, Stefan.  His last wish as king, and possibly the last wish of his life, is for his son Stefan to journey to America, find the now-grown Princess Tatiana, bring her back to her homeland and marry her.  Stefan is completely against the idea.  Not only does he have no desire to marry a woman he's never met, he's sure the pampered princess will turn out to be extremely beautiful.  Unlike most men who would be thrilled at the prospect of a beautiful bride, Stefan suffered an horrific accident when he was younger.  While trying to save his younger brother from a pack of rampaging wolves, his face was disfigured.  Left scarred physically and emotionally, Stefan has resigned himself to a life of scorn from beautiful women.  Though reluctant, Stefan decides to honor his father's last wish and journeys to America with three of his friends.    What follows is one of Johanna Lindsey's best stories as Tanya becomes accustomed to the idea that she's actually a lost foreign princess and Stefan learns that not all beautiful women are shallow and self-serving.  I've always found everything about this book engaging.  The plot, the dialogue, the characters, the setting all come together for an amazing read.  Tanya is probably one of Ms. Lindsey's most likeable heroines.  Tough, sassy, brave and completely capable of taking care of herself, Tanya's had to work for a living her entire life.  Stefan is a unique hero, with deep emotional scars and he's the perfect compliment for Tanya, who has also suffered greatly in her young life.  Together their love story is tender and touching.  You'll cheer when they finally get together!    Not only are the main characters some of the best in Ms. Lindsey's outstanding career, the secondary characters in the form of Stefan's personal guard are all intriguing, highly likeable men.  You'll be thrilled to know that his cousin Vasili gets a story of his own (the sequel to this book, _You Belong To Me_) and you'll wish, as I do, that Ms. Lindsey would continue the story of Cardinia with the stories of Serge and Lazar.    I've been a fan of Ms. Lindsey's work for over a decade.  I've read each of her books numerous times and still savor each book like it's brand new.  In fact, most of Ms. Lindsey's work is some of my all-time favorites in thisgenre.  Such is the case with _Once A Princess_, the classic fairy-tale story of Tanya Dobbs, a European princess turned Mississippi barmaid and Stefan Barany, the arrogant king who wins her heart.	2004-09-13

It's the Christmas season at Haverston and the Malorys and their extended family are gathering to bring in the holidays together.  In the midst of the usual family squabbles, a beautiful and intriguing package arrives -- but no one seems to know where it came from. <br /> <br />Inside the package is the account of the second Marquis, Christopher Malory, and his half-gypsy, half-Russian wife, Anastasia.  As any long-time reader of the Malory series knows, it's often been reputed there was a gypsy in the Malory family past and Ms. Lindsey's _The Present_ is the final confirmation of the rumor.  <br /> <br />In my opinion the two plots of this book could have been better handled as two separate books.  The first plot, the well-known Malorys meeting for a Christmas reunion, with a bit of romance between Jason and his housekeeper thrown in, would have done well for a book this length.  However, the second plot, the story of Christopher and Anastasia, while intriguing, was not quite as fleshed out as I would have liked.  I realize _The Present_ was only meant to be a novella and was only intended to hold Malory fans over until the next full installment, but I feel this story would have been better utilized as a full-fledged prequel.  With so many things going on, so many characters to deal with and so many plots and sub-plots, there was entirely too much information to be squeezed into such a small book.  Many aspects that usually make up a Lindsey book were skimmed over and more often than not left out completely.  By the end of the book I felt cheated in many respects. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, while _The Present_ is not quite on par with previous books in the series, it was still a pleasant way to spend an evening.  I really enjoyed catching up with all of my favorite characters and getting a glimpse into the future with the new generation of Malory children.  I just wish I'd had more time with the Malory ancestors. <br /> <br />Until recently this was the lastbook of the Malory family annals.  Thankfully, since the last time I read this amazing series, Ms. Lindsey has extended it to include Jeremy's story (_A Loving Scoundrel_, currently only available in hardback).  As a fan of all the characters introduced in these outstanding books, I fervently hope Ms. Lindsey has plans to continue the saga.  There are so many characters (namely the Anderson brothers) who would benefit from stories of their own.  Until such time as she decides to give us what we all want, though, I will continue to revisit the current Malory books -- I never tire of this amazing family.	2004-09-06

Though Derek has been a minor character in the background of the series, he definitely shines in this unique Regency romance.    Derek Malory, heir to the Marquis of Haverston, is following fast in the footsteps of his two rakehell uncles.  Though more gentle and kindhearted in his love affairs, he is definitely a man interested in pleasure for pleasure's sake.  Unlike other reviewers, I found it exhilarating to have a hero who wasn't an alpha male.  Beyond popular belief, not all women are attracted to overbearing brutes and that's usually the type of hero you find in this genre.  Derek Malory is a cut above the rest.    Kelsey Langton, though gently bred, must sell herself in a house of pleasure to save her family.  Ignorant in the art of love, Kelsey is forced to act as mistress to the man who buys her.  I was extremely impressed with Kelsey's character.  She's strong, brave and self-sacrificing.  In a genre full of selfish, conceited heroines Kelsey shines.    I've read numerous Regency-era romances, but _Say You Love Me_ is far from being a cardboard copy of the rest.  The premise is interesting, the mystery intriguing and the love between Derek and Kelsey is sweet without being sugary.  In fact, I found the entire book uniquely pleasurable -- I could scarcely make myself put it down.    _Say You Love Me_ would be an amazing story on its own, but it's even better as an addition to the Malory family saga.  All of the previous characters are involved in the plot and help move the story along.  As usual, their wit and charm make for an outstanding adventure.    Over the last 10 years I've come to expect great things from Ms. Lindsey and once again she's proven why that is.  She creates memorable characters, puts them in fascinating situations and ties it all together with excitement, passion, romance and humor.  I highly recommend this book to all fansof the Malory family.	2004-09-04

I've always had a fascination with ancient Egypt, though I've been unable to find many historical romances set in that time period.  I was pleasantly surprised to come across _Lady Of The Upper Kingdom_. <br /> <br />Lady Farahapsut, a priestess of Bast, is as spirited and regal as her goddess.  Pledged since birth to sing praises to Bast and care for Bast's earth form -- a beautiful caracal cat -- Farahapsut is devoted to her faith above all else. <br /> <br />Captain Philip Tauron is a Macedonian soldier traveling with Alexander, the conqueror of Egypt.  Arrogant to a fault, he believes in taking what he wants, regardless of the consequences. <br /> <br />Thrown together in a farce of a marriage to unite their two cultures, these two powerful and determined people do their best to honor their vows.  Philip must learn to accept a high-spirited, opinionated Egyptian woman, while Farah must learn to trust and respect one of the men who've come to claim her beloved country.  Slowly, a mutual affection forms between them, but when faced with the wrath of the Lord of Deneba, who had once been the betrothed of Farahapsut, it takes love to help them overcome tragedy. <br /> <br />Ms. Lovelace has a true talent for making the time period come alive.  The reader is left with the feeling of walking the streets of Egypt on the cusp of the founding of Alexandria.  You can almost smell the lotus flowers and hear the rush of the Nile in each page you turn.   <br /> <br />Though this was my first book by Ms. Lovelace, I will certainly look up more of her work.  If you're fascinated by the ancient Egyptian culture and looking for a book full of romance and passion, look no further than _Lady Of The Upper Kingdom_.	2004-09-03

Unlike most fans of Ms. Lindsey's Malory saga, I did not fall in love with James Malory in the first two books of the series.  I found him rude, contemptuous and downright unlikable.  In fact, it boggled my mind to see all the people who absolutely adored him, when I was hard-pressed to make myself read any scene that included him.  However, all of that changed with his story in _Gentle Rogue_. <br /> <br />James Malory, the black-sheep of the much loved Malory family, is a cynical, world-weary ex-pirate.  He's vowed, more than once, to never marry or even allow a woman to mean anything to him.  He's more than happy to spend his life jumping from one paramour to the next and never having to commit his heart into any relationship outside of his own family.  Much of his trepidation comes from seeing so many ladies of his acquaintance be unfaithful to their husbands (it's beside the point, he thinks, that those ladies were unfaithful with him).  He figures, if he never takes the proverbial plunge, he'll never have to live through having someone be unfaithful to him. <br /> <br />Georgina Anderson, an American heiress, pledged her heart to a boy when she was barely sixteen years old.  Now 22, she's decided to find her intended, who she hasn't seen in a number of years because of the war, so they can begin their life together.  She travels to England, along with a family friend, and finds more than she bargained for.  Heart-sick, out of money, and desperate to go home, Georgina and her companion sign on as crew members on the Maiden Anne, a ship sailing for Jamaica.  Forced to hide her beauty in the guise of a boy, Georgina finds herself thrust into the role of cabin boy for the captain, James Malory. <br /> <br />Though fate has thrown them together, it takes more than that to join their stubborn hearts.  Through pain and pleasure and the course of a voyage to America these two proud souls find that nothing means more to them than being together. <br /> <br />_Gentle Rogue_ is classic Lindsey at her best.  There's just enough humor, passion, romance and angst to keep the pages turning almost of their own free will.  The characters come to life and soon you feel they're old friends you've known forever.  _Gentle Rogue_ is also the introduction of another infamous Lindsey family -- the Andersons.  The Andersons are the American counterpart of the Malorys -- just as spirited, loyal, tempestuous and lovable.  I fervently hope each Anderson brother gets his own story. <br /> <br />If you've come this far with the Malorys, don't stop now.  The next story in line, _The Magic Of You_, is the story of Amy Malory, a Regina look-alike with all the boldness of Tony and James, the determination of Jason and the luck of her father, Edward.	2004-08-31

Though Amy is only a minor character in the first three books of the series, and at first I was disappointed that Ms. Lindsey hadn't picked a more prominent character to write about, I was pleasantly surprised with this book.    Amy Malory may look like her cousin Regina, she may even have the ability to manipulate a situation like her cousin, but she's also inherited a fair amount of her personality from the male members of the Malory clan.  Bold and brazen like her uncles Tony and James, Amy has set her sights on Warren Anderson (you'll remember him as Georgina's brother in _Gentle Rogue_) and nothing will stand in her way.  Fresh from the schoolroom, Amy is far from naive.  Though innocent in action, her unabashed personality is just the match for the iron-willed and often ruthless Warren.    Warren Anderson has little use for women other than to soothe the yearnings of his body.  Played false by a beautiful woman he thought he loved, Warren's heart is hidden behind so many walls he's sure no one will ever hurt him again.  From the first minute Warren meets Amy he's shocked by her bold advances and even as his body responds to her in a way he can't control, he uses his strong resolve to resist her charms.      Though I'm a fan of all the Malory books, I'd have to say this one ties for the best book of the series with _Tender Rebel_.  Amy's forthrightness is refreshing and certainly a welcome change from the simpering, sighing maidens who can usually be found as heroines in this genre.  And, appropriately enough, this ground-breaking heroine gets a hero who isn't a cardboard copy of all the rest.  Warren is far from being the perfectly romantic and dashing hero.  He's rough around the edges and needs some serious adjustment to his attitude.    I'm really surprised with the tepid reviews this book has received, since I think it's among the best of Ms.Lindsey's work.  If you're looking for a fiery romance between two strong, independent and bold characters, look no further than Amy and Warren.  I know you'll love them as much as I have.	2004-08-31

I've always been fascinated with all things Arthurian and so I picked up _The Story of King Arthur_ by Tom Crawford. Included in this book are stories of the Sword in the Stone, the Round Table, Sir Lancelot, Morgan le Fay, Merlin, Guenevere and much more. I feel this book would be a nice way to introduce children to the legend. It contains just enough magic and daring exploits to keep them interested. It would also be satisfactory for older children or adults who want to reacquaint themselves with the tale. Though certainly not the best I've seen, the illustrations were nice and used in such a way as to bring the story to life while not taking from it. All in all, a pleasant, quick read at a great price.	2004-08-30

Though slightly outdated, _The Best Baby Name Book_ is still a good resource for baby names. Not only are there things to consider when naming your baby, there are stereotypes, fascinating facts about names, birthstones and flowers, a baby name worksheet and over 13,000 names to choose from. Each name is listed with it's origin, variations and nicknames clearly visible and easy to understand. I found quite a few interesting and beautiful names. Definitely one to keep around when you're making that important decision!	2004-08-30

Being a fan of JAG I was surprised and excited when I found out there was a TV Tie-In book for the series. I promptly ordered the book and wasn't quite sure what to expect, having read a fair amount of Tie-Ins that were nothing like the series they portrayed. Happily, I was well pleased with my choice!  <br /> <br />I feel that Robert Tine really captured the feel of an episode of JAG. The characters were well-drawn and right on par with the ones I've grown to love through the show. The dialogue and thought processes of the characters were spot-on except for Harm's penchant to revert to heavy cursing -- something I felt was completely out of character for someone who is so good at expressing himself.  <br /> <br />The action was fast paced and exciting, I was kept guessing and completely immersed until the very end. This story line would certainly make a wonderful episode of JAG -- one I'd love to see. There was just enough humor thrown in -- namely Harm being shifted from one place to another -- to lighten the mood while still advancing the plot.  <br /> <br />Mr. Tine also captured the chemistry of Harm and Mac perfectly -- right down to the way they play so well off one another. And as a bonus -- Harm even gets to fly! That, in my opinion, is always a plus!  <br /> <br />There were a few disappointments such as one quite confusing place where some sentences seemed to have been left out of a pretty important scene and there were a few typos spattered throughout that could have been caught through tighter proofreading.  <br /> <br />I was sad to note the absence of a picture section toward the middle as I've seen in other TV Tie-Ins -- it would have made a nice addition to the book.  <br /> <br />All that aside, I still rate this book 5 stars because it kept my attention as well as the actual program does and the fact that I will read this book again. Mr. Tine certainly did his research, I could actually see the actors who play these parts in my head as I read.  <br /> <br />Despite the few errors and the brief slip-up on Harm's character it was a good, solid read that I thoroughly enjoyed. I'm completely looking forward to the next JAG novel by Robert Tine -- Clean Steel -- and hope that there are plans for other Tie-In novels for this spectacular television program.	2004-08-30

I was hoping it would be just as exciting and fast paced as the first. Thankfully, I was not disappointed.  <br /> <br />Again, I feel that Robert Tine really has a knack for capturing the feel of an episode of JAG. The characters were true to form and mirror images of the ones I've grown to love through the show. The dialogue was authentic -- funny when called for and serious when it had to be.  Something I love about JAG is the tendency to jump from humor to drama and Mr. Tine captures that feel very well in this novel.  <br /> <br />As per the first novel, the plot was enthralling and intricate and kept me guessing and completely involved right up until the very end. This story line would really make an exciting episode of JAG!  <br /> <br />Again, I was well pleased with Mr. Tine's ability to capture the chemistry between Harm and Mac perfectly. Their banter was just as witty and captivating as that on the program.  <br /> <br />An added bonus in this book is the increased inclusion of Bud Roberts -- a character I've grown fond of and who adds much to the story by way of levity.  <br /> <br />Once again I was sad to note that a picture section had not been included in this book either -- I still say this would make a nice addition to these highly readable books!  <br /> <br />All in all, _Clean Steel_ was a superb read -- on the same par with the first book in this series. I was quite impressed with this book and will read it again.  Once more I was able to picture the actors who play these parts while I read the story which is a exceptional accomplishment on the part of Mr. Tine -- he captured their essence so well.  <br /> <br />_Clean Steel_ was a first class read that I completely enjoyed. I certainly hope there are plans to continue with this line of TV Tie-Ins. I, for one, would definitely buy them!	2004-08-30

The second in Ms. Lindsey's Malory Family series is, quite possibly, the best.  _Tender Rebel_ is the story of Anthony Malory (you'll remember him from _Love Only Once_), possibly London's most notorious rake, and the Scottish beauty who tames him. <br /> <br />Roslynn Chadwick has spent most of her 25 years sequestered at her grandfather's home in the Scottish Highlands.  She's had little time for the life of a debutante, thus the reason she's managed to stay unwed at such an advanced age (in that time, of course, it was unthinkable for a woman to reach 25 without having been married at least once).  Now her grandfather has died, leaving his vast empire in her care and her with the promise to marry quickly to keep that wealth away from her scheming cousin Geordie.  With Geordie on her heels, Roslynn escapes to London, hoping to enter society and find a suitable husband. <br /> <br />Anthony Malory is perfectly happy with his rakehell life until the day he sees Roslynn sneaking out of a ballroom to escape the amorous advances of a throng of suitors.  From that moment on, though he's even loath to admit the reason to himself, he does everything within his power to convince Roslynn that none of the men she's considering for marriage will suit her at all.  He's settled it in his mind that she'll be his, and he won't back down until he's accomplished his goal. <br /> <br />If you're familiar with the Malorys (and you really should read the first book in the series, _Love Only Once_, before attempting this one) you'll be more than pleased with Anthony's story.  Roslynn is the perfect match for Anthony -- bold, independent and just jealous enough to keep someone with his reputation in line. <br /> <br />Unlike many of the other reviewers, I feel that Ms. Lindsey was extremely true to Tony's character.  He reacted just the way I'd imagined he would when the day finally came that he fell in love.  The plot was engaging, the humor refreshing as always, and the love story wastempered with just enough angst to make it believable. <br /> <br />Once you're done with this book, be sure to look up the next in the series, _Gentle Rogue_, for the story of Tony's older brother James.  That story picks up during this one and ties both of the books together beautifully.	2004-08-24

It's the story of Regina Ashton, beloved niece of the Malory brothers, whose only sister died when Regina was just a baby, leaving her in their care.      Regina and her uncles want her to find a husband, but she can't seem to find anyone that will please everyone.  She's seen hundreds of men, so many that society has deemed her a cold fish, thinking she must be entirely cold-hearted and self-centered.  That's not the case at all, it's just nearly impossible to please four overprotective men.    Viscount Nicholas Eden, a rakehell who has refused to ever marry owing to a secret in his past, is completely bored with his current mistress, Selena Eddington.  He's started treating her badly and she's decided that it would be prudent to end things with him now, hoping to provoke a jealous reaction from him.    Finding herself in desperate need to talk to her uncle Tony, hoping he'll be able to convince her uncles that she's fed up with looking for a husband, Regina borrows Selena Eddington's conveyance.  Having had too much to drink, Nicholas spots his former paramour's carriage outside Anthony Malory's home and decides to play a nasty trick on her and keep her from attending the party of the season.  After her discussion with Tony, Regina bundles herself up in her cape and steps outside, only to be swept up on horseback by Nicholoas, who thinks he's kidnapped Selena!    Once home, Nicholas dumps Regina, who he still believes to be Selena, in one of his guest rooms, locks the door and leaves for the party himself.  Only minutes after arriving at the party, Nicholas realizes his mistake and hurries home to see who he's actually abducted.  The moment he throws open the door, he and Regina both are stunned.  There's an instant attraction between them that almost crackles from the pages.    Despite careful planning on everyone's part, the story of Regina's abduction by one of London's most notorious rakes leaks out and Regina's reputation is ruined.  Now, the once sought after beauty has very little chance of ever securing a good match.  But, it's not the blot to her reputation that prompts Regina to have her uncles coerce Nicholas into marrying her, it's the fact that she's finally found the one man she can love completely.  She's set her cap for him, and there's very little that Regina Ashton wants that she doesn't get.    Things really start to pick up as Nicholas does his best to escape matrimony and Regina tries her hardest to make him love her.  There are numerous misunderstandings, painful words and harsh feelings between them and things really get complicated when it turns out Nicholas has a very dangerous enemy.  As the story unfolds, you'll find the pages nearly turn themselves.    Not only is the story of Regina and Nicholas incredible on it's own, it's the opening to a series of books about a family you'll grow to love.  The Malorys are a fiercely loyal family full of rakehells, rogues and beautiful women who are all passionate and spirited.  All of the characters are so well-written that you'll feel like you know them.  From Anthony, the rake with a heart of gold, to James, the sometimes pirate, there's never a lack of  interesting people.  Not to mention, this is the first introduction of one of my very favorite characters in the series -- James' son Jeremy (who definitely needs a story of his own!).    Though written nearly 20 years ago, _Love Only Once_ is an amazingly well-written Regency romance.  Even at such an early stage in her career, Ms. Lindsey reveals why she is, even today, one of the top authors in this genre.  I first read this story years ago and have continued visiting it once every couple of years.  I never tire of the Malorys and their exploits.  If you've never been introduced to this family, what are you waiting for?	2004-08-23

As always, _Three To Get Deadly_ finds rookie bounty hunter Stephanie Plum in too deep and sinking fast.  Once again, this books starts only a few months after the previous in the series, and Stepanie's still learning the ropes.   <br /> <br />This time around it's Stephanie's job to bring in Moses Bedemier, the closest thing to God-on-Earth in the 'burg.  \\"Uncle Mo\\", as everyone calls him, has been running the local candy shop for years and he's managed to make nearly everyone in town love him to bits.  No one's able to believe that Mo would do anything even remotely against the law.  But, as much as everyone loves him, no one knows a thing about him.  There's not a single person who knows anything about his personal life.  And, as is usually the case, appearances are deceiving, and Stephanie finds herself in the middle of a string of unexplained murders.   <br /> <br />As with all the books in the series, the characters are what really make the story fantastic.  Ms. Evanovich has a knack for making each and every character come to life in vivid detail.

Once again, _Two For The Dough_ finds New Jersey girl Stephanie Plum in over her head tracking fugitives from justice for her cousin Vinnie.  Set only a few months after the first book in the series, Stephanie's still doing her best to settle into her new career.  She's got a few new toys in her arsenal (namely pepper spray and a stun gun), but she's yet to master the use of her .38.  She's still turning to Ranger (another, more experienced bounty hunter) for take-down pointers, but she's starting to think like a bounty hunter on her own. <br /> <br />This time around, Stephanie's in pursuit of Kenny Mancuso who's charged with shooting his former best friend in the knee.  It turns out that Kenny, who just happens to be the cousin of Joe Morelli (the fugitive from the first book and a former romantic interest of Stephanie's) is a lot more dangerous than anyone had anticipated and Stephanie finds herself the recipient of some very disturbing packages.  In the midst of looking for Mancuso, Stephanie comes in contact with one of his former school friends, Spiro Stiva, who's working at his step-father's mortuary.  Spiro hires Stephanie on the side to find some caskets that have gone missing since all the stuff with Kenny started.  One thing leads to another and everything hits the fan.  If you're not a veteran of the genre, you'll have a seriously hard time figuring out the mystery before the pieces of the puzzle are revealed to you. <br /> <br />As with the previous book, I found that the humor and the characters drove the story for me even more than the mystery.  Stephanie's family, her co-workers, and even Stephanie herself are some of the most finely written characters I've ever had the pleasure to read.  Some of the situations they find themselves in will leave you laughing out loud and garnering strange looks from those around you.  Ms. Evanovich is a master at her craft, drawing you into her world and refusing to let go.  And what a wild, wacky and wonderful placeher world is. <br /> <br />Run, don't walk, to the checkout and buy the whole series, I guarantee you won't regret it.	2004-08-22

While this third book in Ms. Lindsey's infamous Viking Trilogy takes a bit longer to pull the reader in than the previous books, it's still a wonderful read.  Definitely not one to be missed if you love the Haardrad family.<br /><br />Selig Haardrad has been blessed since the time of his birth when his father defied Viking law and brought him back to life.  Now a grown man, Selig is, for lack of a better word, beautiful.  With his beauty has come a lifetime of pampering from every woman he's ever come in contact with.  All this doting has certainly gone to his head for he believes that all women will succumb to his charms and each of them can be wrapped around his little finger with no work whatsoever on his part.  Add this conceit to the already overblown Viking arrogance and you're left with a man who could stand to be taken down a peg or two.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I dislike Selig -- quite the contrary, actually -- I just feel it wouldn't hurt him to have a woman who didn't immediately give in to his every little whim.<br /><br />While on a mission for his brother-in-law's King, Selig is set upon by thieves who leave him gravely wounded assuming that he's dead.  When he's finally able to pull himself together enough to search for help, he happens upon Gronwood castle and the lovely Lady Erika.  Falsely branded a spy and sentenced to a lashing, he vows to seek revenge on the first woman who's ever caused him pain.<br /><br />Even though Erika might not have been the heroine I'd had in mind for Selig, I came to accept her and yes, like her very much.  While she's not as tough as Brenna, or even as over-the-top as Kristen, she has a gentle grace, a quiet strength and a strong possessive streak (which she'll definitely need with a husband like Selig).  She's tough when she has to be, but often regrets her actions once they've been doled out.  As is the case with her imprisonment of Selig.  I'm really shocked at all the reviewers who seem to think Erika was in the wrong to treat Selig the way she did.  She was only doing what anyone in her position at that time would have done -- protecting her keep in a time when the memories of war were still fresh in everyone's mind.  She didn't overstep her bounds or even do anything that was remotely shocking.<br /><br />Probably my favorite part of the book was the inclusion of characters from both the previous books.  Unlike some authors who rarely keep consistency between books in a series, Ms. Lindsey is a master at keeping well-loved characters true to form.  Brenna, Garrick, Kristen, Royce, Meghan and Alden all make an appearance, giving the book a sort of family reunion feel for the reader.  As for new characters, Ms. Lindsey doesn't disappoint in that area either.  From Erica's brother Ragnar (whose story I definitely wouldn't mind reading in the future!) to Erika's best friend Turgeis, the reader finds new characters to love who shine with the same vividness and color that any Lindsey fan has come to expect from her work.  Also, keep a look out for Kristen's children!<br /><br />Unlike most of the reviewers, I wasn't at all upset with the way the scenes of the book were laid down.  In fact, after the slow start, I felt the book really picked up and turned out to be one of the best reads I've had in a long time.  The scene towards the end at the lake is priceless and had me laughing out loud for quite some time.<br /><br />As a long-time fan of Ms. Lindsey's work I wasn't disappointed in _Surrender My Love_.  In fact, the only thing that disappoints me about the book is that so far it's the last of the series.  I hate to say goodbye to the Haardrad clan and fervently hope Ms. Lindsey plans to revisit this amazing family sometime in the near future.	2004-08-20

I'd heard great things about Janet Evanovich but never got around to reading any of her work.  A couple of days ago I stumbled upon 6 of her Stephanie Plum novels and decided to take the plunge.  I'm extremely glad I did. <br /> <br />Stephanie Plum is a no-nonsense New Jersey girl with attitude.  I'd go so far as to say she's the best heroine I've read in years.  Out of work, out of money and pretty soon to be out on the street, Stephanie decides to go to work as a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie.  With no experience in any form of law enforcement, Stephanie plunges in head-first without checking the water level.  It's really delightful to see her come to terms with her new career and start to pick up the ins and outs of the business. <br /> <br />From the minute I started the book I couldn't put it down.  The writing is light and humorous, the plot is just sinister enough to be enjoyable without being melodramatic and the secondary characters are charming.  Having just read the one book, I can already tell that Ms. Evanovich has a knack for shaping a story into something truly wonderful.  I'm already itching to start the next in the series.	2004-08-20

Though I am definitely several years past teenage-hood myself, I still like to read the occasional young-adult book, if for no other reason than to think back a few years when life problems were a lot more fun.<br /><br />I picked up this edition, which combines both the first and second books of _The Princess Diaries_ series, last night for a bit of light reading and managed to finish the entire thing (400 some-odd pages) in less than a day.  It's been ages since I've wanted to do that with a book.  Both books were easy to read and extremely fun.<br /><br />Mia Thermopolis is an average teenage girl.  That is, until her dad shows up to tell her that she's next in line, after him, to rule a small European country.  Things start happening pretty quickly after that as Mia comes to terms with who she is and how a Princess is supposed to act (thanks to on-going Princess Lessons with her Grandmere, the dowager Princess).<br /><br />All of the characters, from Mia's austere Grandmere, to her slightly flaky Mom and over-the top best friend Lilly are well-drawn, believable and even likeable (each in different ways, of course).  A good book can be based on one very strong character, but in my opinion the thing that makes a great book is an entire cast of wonderful characters.  You will definitely find those within the pages of these books.<br /><br />What really made me love both of the books so much, though, (even more than just a great cast of characters) was the humor.  Ms. Cabot's writing is light and fresh and just what I've been needing for a bit of a pick me up.  More often than not I found myself laughing out loud every few pages.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the next books in the series and plan to also look up Ms. Cabot's other work.  You should do the same, you won't be disappointed.	2004-08-18

In this spectacular sequel to Ms. Lindsey's classic _Fires Of Winter_, we are introduced to Brenna and Garrick's daughter, Kristen.   <br /> <br />Beautiful Kristen Haardrad has waited many years to find a man she can love.  She's searched among the countless men in her country but has yet to find one to stir her heart.  When she hears of her brother Selig's plan to take their father's ship merchanting, she thinks it will be the perfect opportunity to seek a love in a new land.  Her parents are against the idea, thinking it unwise for a young lady to travel aboard a ship full of lustful Viking men.  But, as the reader soon finds out, Kristen is in fact her mother's daughter.  She takes matters into her own hands and stows away on the ship, thinking it will be a grand adventure and the chance she's been waiting for to find her heartmate.  Unbeknownst to her, the young Vikings are *not* going away to try their hand at being merchants, but have decided to raid a Saxon monastery before the Dane's can steal all the wealth of the land for themselves.  As soon as the ship docks in Wessex things do not go as planned.  The Saxons attack the Vikings and take the survivors (including Kristen disguised as a boy) back to Wyndhurst Hall as prisoners. <br /> <br />Royce of Wyndhurst has suffered great loss at the hands of Viking raiders and has little mercy for the captives brought to him for judgment until one of his men suggests that they could be used to build up the defenses of the keep and ward off future attacks.  He reluctantly agrees, but keeps a watchful eye on the slaves in case of a rebellion that would cause the deaths of his people.  He notices a puny boy among the powerful Viking men and is intrigued when those men show such care for the lad.  Thinking that this young man must be their leader he has the boy whipped, only to find out that the boy is, in fact, a woman.  Stunned by the statuesque beauty he has enslaved, Royce mistakenly assumes she must have sold herself to the Viking men to ease their long and lonely voyage.  He's disgusted by her nationality and low morals and tries his hardest to use that as a buffer against his attraction to her.  It doesn't take him long to succumb to her enticing offers, though, and soon it doesn't matter what sort of woman she is, only that she's *his* woman. <br /> <br />I've read nearly all of Ms. Lindsey's work and I'd have to say that this one tops my favorites list.  The characters (both new and from the previous book), the humor, the passion and the angst all add up to an amazing story that will have you laughing out loud one minute and crying the next.  Kristen and Royce play off each other very well -- their characters are well matched and most of the time you'll be unsure who's the master and who's the slave.  Every scene is well thought out and essential to the book, but the end of the book, in particular, is hilarious and such a fitting way to bring Brenna and Garrick back into the story that it's nearly impossible to put down.  You'll be thanking your lucky stars that there's another book in the series (_Surrender My Love_). <br /> <br />I'm sure I'm not the only one who hopes Ms. Lindsey intends to write about some of the other characters introduced in this book.  Royce's sister Meghan, his cousin Alden, and Kristen's younger brothers Eric and Thorall would all make wonderful additions to an already outstanding series. <br /> <br />If you've never read these books, don't wait any longer to fall in love with Johanna Lindsey's Vikings.	2004-08-17

Trained in the art of war, Brenna Carmarham vowed to never take a husband until her father made a deal with the hated Vikings in hopes of saving her home.  Not long after the deal is made, her much-loved father dies, but reluctantly Brenna decides to honor her father's vow anyway and awaits her intended with trepidation.  On the day of her father's funeral, the Vikings finally come, but not with a bride-groom as expected.  Instead, the Vikings raid Brenna's home, kill most of her family and take her prisoner, making her the slave of the man she'd once thought to marry. <br /> <br />Having been spurned by a money-hungry woman, Garrick Haardrad has vowed to never love again.  While he's away on a trading venture his father makes a false deal with the hated Celts to join Garrick with a Celtic lord's daughter.  However, the marriage-pact is just a smoke-screen to allow the Vikings to raid the Celtic village and take revenge on the Celts for long-ago wrongdoing.  And now, the woman who might have been his wife is his slave. <br /> <br />I first read _Fires Of Winter_ many years ago and to this day it remains one of my favorites by Ms. Lindsey.  In fact, I'd have to say it's one of my favorites in the entire genre.  Johanna Lindsey always delivers well-drawn and likeable characters, and Brenna and Garrick are no exception.  Brenna is fiery, brave and headstrong while Garrick is stoic, courageous and stubborn.  When these two first meet, sparks fly and wills clash in a battle that will leave you wanting more.  And, since you will want more, it's lucky that Ms. Lindsey expanded this book into a trilogy (this one is followed by _Hearts Aflame_ and _Surrender My Love_). <br /> <br />One of the most fascinating aspects, for me, is the history.  You're thoroughly immersed in the Viking culture.  While sometimes the inclusion of historical details can weigh a book down with unnecessary information, I've always found that Ms. Lindsey incorporates history perfectly, weaving it into the story in such a way that only makes it more enjoyable.  In fact, she's so good at this, that I often wish more of the history had been included. <br /> <br />I've noticed a few of the reviewers commenting on the brutality included in the book (the rape, pillaging, murder and abuse), but when reading this book you have to consider the time period (both when the novel was written and when the novel takes place).  After doing so, I think you'll be able to see these scenes in a different light.  While I am far from condoning rape or the abuse of women in any form, such was the way things were in times past.  The hero *does* rape the heroine on several occasions, but as he grows to love her he grows as a person.  You have to understand that Garrick, though having a Christian mother, has been raised a true Viking -- someone who is used to treating women like chattel.  When looked at in that way, you come to see that it's not completely Garrick's fault that he is the way he is, he's a product of a brutal and unforgiving society.  And he doesn't stay that way, he does grow into a likeable character. <br /> <br />All in all, _Fires Of Winter_ is a roller-coaster ride of love, passion and history.  You'll be hard-pressed to put the book down, so make sure once you start you have a significant amount of time in which to finish it.

It's Christmas morning in Connecticut and everything's finally going right for Jessica and Christopher when fate decides to deal them a cruel blow. <br /> <br />Just as the celebrations are about to begin, both Christopher and Jessica are swept back in time to the 19th century.  Jessica, along with her son Kit, is cast into the life of a serving maid a few miles from her 20th century home, while Christopher winds up in New York, only 40 miles away from his family.  Neither knows what has happened to the other and both assume they'll never see each other again.  They both pursue new lives but never forget the love they shared. <br /> <br />It's two years before they finally run into each other purely by accident.  Jessica's settled into the life of a servant and Christopher has built a successful shipping business and has a new fiance.   <br /> <br />Though they are back together, things are far from easy and the road to love is a long and bumpy one. <br /> <br />The book follows the characters right up until the end of their lives, so you're left with no doubt this time whether or not they are able to stay together. <br /> <br />Overall I was glad to see what happened to the characters, though I feel that Ms. Simon wasn't exactly true to the character of Christopher.  In this book I really found it hard to like him at all and more often than not I actually hated him. <br /> <br />I do recommend this book if you've read the first one, but once again keep a box of tissues on hand, you'll definitely need them.	2004-08-10

Having just finished Ms. Simon's _Hold Fast To Love_, I was prompted to revisit the book that made me fall in love with her writing.  I'd originally read _Love Once In Passing_ years ago and then spent at least another year looking for its sequel (_Love Once Again_) because I fell completely in love with the characters and their story.  <br /> <br />Jessica Lund is a quintessential 20th century woman -- head-strong, confident, brave and independent.  Her life is turned upside down with the unexpected arrival of 19th century Earl Christopher Dunlap.  From the moment they meet the sparks fly from the page.  Christopher accepts almost instantly that he's somehow been misplaced in time, but it takes quite a bit longer for Jessica to realize what he's telling her is the truth.  Once realization sets in, Jessica enjoys showing Christopher all the many technological advances in the world since his time.  They form a close friendship which, after a few rough patches, turns into something much more.  They love quickly and deeply all the while aware that at any moment they'll be parted forever.  The reader shares in their joy, which is often bittersweet, feeling each high and low and fearing, as they do, the moment when it will all be over. <br /> <br />My only complaint with the book is the accident that happens about half-way through.  I won't go into details, since it gives too much of the plot away, just suffice to say that your heart will break as so much of their precious time is wasted.  Make sure you have a box of tissues on hand for the ending (and, if at all possible, the sequel). <br /> <br />All said, _Love Once In Passing_ is a poignant love story that reaffirms the fact that once love is found each moment should be cherished while you have the time.	2004-08-07

Having read and loved another of Ms. Simon's books (_Love Once In Passing_), I was really thrilled to stumble upon another on my last trip to the bookstore.  Keeping that in mind, I had high hopes for this book and thankfully I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br />As with the previous book I'd read, I was pleased to note that _Hold Fast To Love_ was a time-travel romance.  Time-travel has always been one of my favorite genres, but not all of the books are well written.  That's definitely not something that can be said for this book.  Also, considering it was written in 1982, it seems to me that the author was very ahead of her time. <br /> <br />The book starts in 1982 with Monica Wagner on an airplane heading for a vacation in Europe.  Within just a few pages, Monica and the reader both are swept back in time to Regency England.  And, while it might have been nice to get to know Monica a bit more in the 'present', it was really exciting for the action to start so quickly.  Almost immediately Monica realizes that she's somehow been thrust into the life of Baroness Marlena von Mantz, a woman who not only looks like her, but has several eerie similarities in her life experiences.   <br /> <br />I'm not usually a fan of first-person narrative, but I feel it was very appropriate for this book.  It gives the reader a very clear view of the thoughts and feelings of Monica as she adjusts to her new life.   <br /> <br />The characters are extremely well-drawn.  Monica handles her daunting experience in the past with a cool, calm reserve that only breaks under the most strenuous circumstances.  She reacts so much better than I would in a similar situation.  The reader comes to know Monica as a strong, independent and remarkable woman.   Both men in the book who pursue Monica -- the Baroness's guardian Justin and the recalcitrant rake Radford -- are worthy of a woman like Monica and you'll be just as hard-pressed to choose between them as Monica herself is. <br /> <br />Though some parts are a bit tedious at times, overall the book was enthralling.  I literally couldn't put it down.  From the time-travel mystery to the other, more pressing mysteries as Monica takes over the life of a 19th century Baroness, the action rarely stops and even three pages from the ending you'll still be unsure of the outcome. <br /> <br />Although I do believe a bit more time could have been spent after our heroine chooses her hero, all in all _Hold Fast To Love_ was an engaging, enjoyable read.  It cemented my faith in Ms. Simon's ability.  She's not an author to be missed.	2004-08-05
