Warshawski Novel	Books	4	10	12	N	N	To enjoy  this book, don't check your brains at the door	I like mysteries that are actually ABOUT something. I enjoy having the crime at hand being set in a real context that encourages me to think about more than the clues and facts at hand. To borrow a phrase from Law & Order, it makes the story feel \\"ripped from the headlines,\\" anchored in real life. And in Blacklist, the HUAC committee activities in the 1950s and the Patriot Act of the 2000's give the story credibility and texture. And while I agree that VI got some very lucky breaks (one of the professional reviewers above commented on a fortunate little tidbit she happened to find at the last minute in a victim's car; something she or the cops certainly would have found earlier), I still enjoyed this book. The incident Vic begins investigating leads her in two very different directions and I was with her every step of the way. The affectionate and well-meaning resistance she got from her dear friend Lottie added a great deal. And early on in the book, when she danced right over a clue that EVEN I GOT, I was annoyed. At the end of the book, I think I got Vic's and Paretsky's point. It's not that it's good to be a \\"screaming liberal,\\" nor that the rich are bad and the poor are good. It's that hero worship can be dangerous, no matter how old we are, and can blind us from the truth as potently as hate can.	2005-10-05

(It took me decades to work my way back to the first Parker/Spenser book.) So I enjoyed following along as the author both set up and solved a mystery and introduced a cast of characters we just know will be reappearing later in the series. Like the Amanda Pepper mysteries by Gillian Roberts, this book is set in Philadelphia, a city I have great affection for. The story itself is not that complex -- Nora is no VI Warshawski or Kay Scarpetta. But it was entertaining and the end really surprised me. The only problem I had -- and from reading some of the other reviews here, I may be alone in this -- is that while I liked the heroine, I really had little use for Emma and Libby, her sisters. I guess I was supposed to find them eccentric and charming, but instead they annoyed me. I expect to come back and revisit this series, so maybe they'll grow on me.	2005-09-16

The Dublin setting was new to me and so charming. And I wish life would more often imitate the fairy tale aspect of it -- the inner beauty of our Plain Jane (or in this case, Miss Fix-It) finally recognized and adored by Mr. Right. Most of all, I appreciated the sympathy with which Ms. Keyes wrote about the women in this story. Ashling, Lisa, Clodagh and Joy are all three dimensional and treated with humor, compassion and respect. One thing, though -- all that smoking! Maybe it's a European thing and smoking is more acceptable on that side of the pond. I was amused by Lisa taking vitamins, doing pilates, worrying about Botox, drinking only bottled water ... and smoking. And there's a scene where Ashling drunkenly whips a can of hairspray from her bag and uses it to save her stockings, while she has a lit cig hanging from her lips. Don't try this at home, ladies!	2005-08-27

I grew up on him and completely adored him -- mostly because my parents and teachers thought he was a bad influence. The partying, the romances, the rebellions, the in-your-face talent ... I had no idea that he was always in so much pain (psychic as well as physical) and that he was always so remote from those around him. While this is most emphatically not a hatchet job, it is a warts-and-all portrait. Most of the negatives attributed to Joe Willie can be ascribed to his youth and immaturity (one of the most famous men in the country at 25) and his drinking (unfortunately his alcoholism seemed to be almost preordained, as for most of his life, booze was his painkiller of choice). The account of his life after football -- learning to live without fame and adoration, building a family and then losing it -- was fascinating to read. I wonder how Lance Armstrong will deal with the zero to 60 (or should I say 60 to zero?) loss of celebrity and adoration that will undoubtedly befall him now that he has retired. And, being a Chicagoland girl, I hope that someone someday writes this comprehensive a biography of our own Michael Jordan, one of the few people on the planet who can actually put himself in Namath's shoes.	2005-08-08

This scenario gives Stout ample opportunity to present greed and jealousy as a motive from suspect to suspect to suspect, and I did find myself wondering \\"whodunit\\" and how until the murderer's identity was finally revealed. There's also a wonderfully witty plot twist at the end that made me smile. And I also came away thinking that Robert Parker should curl up with a few Wolfe mysteries. I used to love his Spenser books, but now the banter between Spenser and Hawk and Spenser and Susan has become tired, old, and often childish. Rex Stout manages to take the familiar characters and remain both true to the interpersonal relationships (Wolfe/Archie, Archie/Stebbins, Wolfe/Cramer, etc.) and consistently entertaining and readable. Stout is a master of this genre and perhaps it's unreasonable to expect another author to reach such heights.	2005-08-03

Yes, her material obsession is ridiculous, but it's funny, too. And her basic sweet optimism and boundless positive energy makes the reader ready to forgive her just about anything. The regular supporting cast is here -- Luke (who finally finds himself exasperated with Becky ...  I wonder what took him so long, and am glad to see he's human), Suze (and her horsey new best friend) and  her parents (who have a wildly funny conversation about Becky, Cher and Kylie Minogue).  There are new characters, too, like Kelly, the dreamy small-town girl who should have been Becky's sister, and Jess, the thrify and sensible environmentalist who is Becky's sister. If you're a fan of the series, I recommend this edition whole-heartedly.	2005-07-21

I loved, LOVED the period pieces. Sidda's chapter about Beatlemania was so spot-on I laughed and cried. I adore the \\"girl power\\" and loyalty and sisterhood the Ya Yas shared for life, and passed along to their children, the Petit Ya Yas. This level of commitment to friendship is important and just as interesting as fidelity to spouse, family or country, but authors seldom explore or celebrate it as Ms Wells does. I've enjoyed growing up with Sidda. And when the plot takes a sudden dark twist, it rang true for me. The one problem I have with this books is a BIG problem, though. Vivi. I can tell by the way Ms. Wells writes about her that I'm supposed to adore this wild, damaged free spirit. But I don't. Granted, she doesn't seem as desperately selfish and self-interested in this book as she has at times in the others, but that's part of the problem, too. Vivi was such a towering (if often obnoxious) character in the other two books that she's imprinted on my memory. And the toned-down Vivi Abbott Walker in this book isn't consistent with the one from the prevous two books	2005-06-23

Hawk is intriguing, I love the descriptions of Boston (a city I have great affection for), and I appreciate how Hawk and Spenser never do anything that doesn't seem consistent with their own code of ethics, which has remained consistent throughout the series. It brings up interesting questions about intimacy, and how much we can change for those we love, if we can change at all. HOWEVER, Spenser and Susan are really annoying! She's got to be about 60 (unless she was significantly younger than Spenser when they took up together, something Spenser never mentioned). Yet she is always stylish, always meticulous in her appearance, always firm of flesh and, in this book, so good at Pilates she could teach the class. This is noteworthy because we never know where she could get the strength, considering she never finishes a meal during the entire book. And yes, Spenser, we know that you're white and Hawk is black. You don't need to mention it once per page. Considering how long Hawk has known Spenser, he's probably even MORE sick of the racial commentary than I am.  For heaven's sake, give it a rest! Parker has developed characters over the year thatI have grown fond of. I wish he had served his creations better.	2005-06-19

I completely missed the part where our hero falls in love with the mysterious and sad Francesca. When did that happen exactly? And what of American ex-patriate professor,  Luigi and Hermano? We're introduced to them at length and then there is no resolution to their story line. The action? What action?

Her \\"disease to please,\\" getting her validation from the men in her life (but oh, what fascinating men!), working so hard to be a better mother ...

Heartbreakingly honest at times, pretentious and facile at others, enjoyable and dear at times, achingly precious at others ... this book spans the spectrum. It's as unpredictable as the protagonist herself and the disease that afflicts her.  I appreciated the unsparing account of her selfishness and guilts as she descended into madness and then bravely crawled back. But it felt more like a screenplay than a novel. It was almost as if Carrie was writing it with an eye toward the Lifetime made-for-TV movie. Still, I recommend it.	2005-05-15

However this book is not devoted to President Kennedy's namesake. He's included here, but so are his equally fascinating -- if not as glamorous -- male cousins. Here are doomed Michael and David, ambitious Joe and a pair of gifted Bobbys (Kennedy and Shriver). There's Tim Shriver, trying to find his way within a powerful family. Ted Kennedy's sons have led particularly poignant lives, dealing with the legacy of Chappaquidick and their mother's alcoholism as well as their uncles' assasinations. I came away from this book with a renewed respect for Jackie and Eunice for their mothering skills, for their sons of Camelot were guided with surer, more attentive and imaginative hands than many of their cousins. While it was an interesting and educational read, I wish it had been longer and gone into more detail. So many of these young men were previously unknown to me and I wanted to know more.

There is genuine character development here -- Sunny is wrestling with her attitude toward men and commitment, and as always with good Parker, the humanity of his main characters makes the plot more compelling. And this time, Parker makes Sunny a bit different than Spenser. (It was sloppy and difficult to accept -- and made me completely nuts -- in previous efforts when a woman 30 years Spenser's junior liked the same food, canine and music as he did.) The mystery this time around is superior to SHRING RAP, too. (Thank goodness!) It wrestles with an interesting point -- what happens when detectives (private or police dept.) know who the perpetrator is, but don't have the means to prove it. This dilema intrigued me enough that I didn't mind that I had solved the mystery long before the end of the book. And as a big Spenser fan, it was interesting to see the working facet of the sometimes annoying Susan Silverman. In all, this effort restored my faith in the Sunny series.	2004-12-19

While this isn't great Cornwell, it at least reads and feels like Cornwell again, which the disgusting BLOW FLY did not. Kay Scarpetta is again brilliant and wise, flawed and human. The Kay who solves the mysteries in this book is the Kay who got me hooked on the series. I'm happy to have her back. Marino has lost weight and quit smoking, but he's still Marino. For me, these two characters and their relationship are the emotional foundation that gives these books texture. Lucy and Benton are still too enigmatic for me to really care about, but Rudy has the potential to be a very interesting recurring character. And the villain of this piece is so much more realistic, and therefore more menacing, than Jay Talley and his werewolf brother. Thankfully Cornwell seems to have finally gotten those two out of her system. While I didn't LOVE it (Joel Marcus and Henri drag the story way, way down) I certainly enjoyed it.

I enjoyed reading about President Kennedy's complicated relationship with Adlai Stevenson and his fascination with the men women found attractive, and why. I also was intrigued by Jackie's ambivalence about her role as First Lady and her role in history, which seemed to be a reflection of her ambivalence about her marriage to the fascinating, trying man she loved.

Spenser is his familiar, wonderful old self -- doing all the right things for his own reasons, living up to his personal code of ethics, and appalled when the world doesn't do the same. The plot is more &quot;Law and Order/ripped from today's headlines&quot; than many of Parker's other efforts, but it doesn't suffer from it and doesn't seem like exploitation. Susan appears in the story for no particular reason, but at least she doesn't annoy me so much my teeth hurt this time.

It is a far more expansive view of Kerry's life than Brinkley's readable but war-focued TOUR OF DUTY. But it's lacking any real sense of the man, which a good biographer would provide. I agree with the earlier reviewer who cited David Mariness' book on Bill Clinton. John Kerry is nearly the same age as Bill Clinton and his life is very rich and varied.

However, the parts of the story that are credible are things that I've read elsewhere -- sometimes even by Mr. Klein. And many other observations seemed intrusive -- if they are even true.

The protagonist, Willie Traynor, is a journalist/entrepreneur who grows up page by page, and I enjoyed his journey. The town of Clanton is carefully drawn. The book is true to the 1970s as I remember them. And the crime that is the catalyst was truly despicable and movingly told. All that said, there are some disappointments. First of all, I figured out whodunnit and why well before the book ended, and I hate it when that happens. And it does seem to be a valentine to the death penalty, which bothered me enormously. (This from the man who wrote THE CHAMBER?) Perhaps Grisham was just being true to the feelings of his characters, but the blood lust did strike me as creepy.

This is what happened to her and her family. This is how she remembers it. What's more, it's how she experienced it -- from both the front seat of the Lincoln Continental and the corridors of Parkland Hospital. This makes it an invaluable historical record, and a moving account written by a woman who had been fired upon in an open car and held her bleeding husband in her arms. Perhaps it is &quot;slight.&quot; I would not have wanted her to embellish or alter her memories of those tragic days just to accommodate readers who measure a book's worth by the number of pages. I did not consider the photographs, the reproduction of her notes nor President Kennedy's undelivered speeches &quot;filler.&quot; They lent texture and veracity to her story. And I do not see how anyone can say there is nothing &quot;new&quot; here. She is the only one of those three surviving passengers who discussed what happened at this length with the public. That in and of itself is &quot;new.&quot; I appreciate this lady's gallantry and her generosity in contributing her family's history to our country's history.

This installment in the Britt Montero series expands our heroine's love life and work relationships in very credible, very moving ways.

This adventure features Dol Bonner, the tough-talking female detective who has appeared briefly in some Wolfe books. As a character, she's interesting. She had her heart broken before the book begins, and consequently insists that she &quot;hates men.&quot; Yet some of her closest relationships are with men. She's proud and efficient and good at her work. However, while it's interesting to watch Stout flesh out a new character and to hear him write in a new voice, it's still not great Stout. Sometimes the story is told from Dol's POV, sometimes it shifts to her partner and friend Syliva, other times the story is told by some one else altogether. This is no where near as satisfying a way to tell a mystery as by telling it all from the detective's point of view, and letting us solve the mystery along with our narrator. So, while this book will be fascinating for Stout's fans, I don't think it holds up very well as a mystery on its own.	2004-01-18

On balance, I loved this book -- just as I loved the author's work on JFK. He has a talent for taking complicated men and making their oversized sins and talents seem very, very human. Detailed and believable, this book is carefully researched and nuanced. I saw no disdain for the South in this book -- instead this is a foreigner's clear-eyed view of that portion of the country, and all it took for Bill Clinton to rise from those beginnings to become Leader of the Free World. It's that amazing rags-to-riches journey, and the poignant and complex Bill/Hillary love story, that is at the heart of this amazing true life story. My only quibble is with some of the more salacious details of the former President's sex life. Do we need to know details of his preferences and anatomy? Just because Gennifer Flowers wrote of it, did Hamilton need to repeat it? This kind of information about a Chief Executive made me squeamish. Robert Dallek handled JFK's prodigious sex drive and the role it played in his life, marriage and Presidency with more class and finesse.	2004-01-14

I guess this shouldn't be a surprise, since the title is taken from a maggot. Cornwell is far more fascinated by the Chandonnes than I ever have been. The manipulative part was far more infuritating. These characters seem to come from a different series. Scarpetta is so remote she seems comatose. Lucy's sexuality slides up and down the continuum -- difficult to accept from such an out and proud lesbian. Marino is his old self, confronting his feelings for Kay (at least internally) with uncommon candor. He's the only one that feels familiar. And THE plot twist (I won't give it away) is so manipulative that I feel as though I've been played like a violin. In all, an unpleasant experience. I agree with the previous reviewer who encourages the talented Ms. Cornwell to just move on, get past the Chandonnes, and give us a credible story we will actually care about.	2004-01-02

A self-actualized reporter enjoying her career and her on again/off again affair with a cop. Then there's Althea, the discarded trophy wife whose claims of being in peril are dismissed by everyone, including her family, as a pathetic plea for attention. Then there's Keppie, the sexpot serial killer (perhaps based on Aileen Wornoss -- sp?). What a thrill ride! As a fiction reader, I would have preferred it if Buchanan had tied up the loose ends a bit better -- was Britt ever investigated for the role as Keppie's accomplice, whatever happened to young Joey, does Keppie ever meet what seems to be her ultimate fate? But maybe the author handled it this way because this is how life is ... we don't always get the answers we want when we want them.	2004-01-02

Being a Midwestern girl, I'll never know what it's like to be a royal and I found this insider's view fascinating. To be fabulously wealthy, yet get all manner of freebies and presents. To have a staff there ready to wait on you, yet to never be away from their judgemental eyes. What a life! No wonder both Charles and Diana were spoiled and far from perfect. I don't see how anyone could be remotely normal given the lives they led. For this peek into Highgrove, I was grateful. However, Ms. Berry herself seems rather unlikeable. Always gossiping, making sure we know that's she's more educated that the Prince and Princess realized, saying that Diana never would have \\"dared\\" lose her famous temper with the housekeeper, it kept me shaking my head. Like other, I'm sure, I suspect if she didn't take this job in the first place just to pen a tell-all.	2003-11-18

However, just as there is good, enjoyable, challenging popular entertainment (be it in books, TV, pop music, theater or film) there is also subpar popular entertainment that wastes the consumer's time. I also agree whole heartedly with the other reviewers who thought that the plot in this book strains credibility and that the dialog and behavior of Sunny, Spike, Julie, the villainous doctor, etc., are just as difficult to  accept. Just as Neil Simon isn't Shakespeare, audiences still have a right to quality entertainment from him. Fans of Parker's Jesse Stone and Spenser expect a certain level of craftsmanship from him, and this time he doesn't deliver.	2003-10-27

Funny at times, certainly exaggerated, and always very glamourous, it was an enjoyable little novel. Yes, it places a terrific emphasis on fashion. That's because the action takes place at a fashion magazine! (The jacket mentions Prada, Armani and Versace, in italics, no less.) Yes, it's superficial and gossipy. Novels that proudly describe themselves as &quot;delightfully dishy&quot; generally aren't known for nuance or subtext. Weisberger is a much better, more talented writer than Candace Bushnell, to whom she's been compared on this board. This book is nowhere near as good as NANNY DIARIES. But it is what it is -- a little tome that's easy to polish off and makes you feel better about your plain little off-the-shelf life.	2003-10-22

Once the action starts, it doesn't stop. I have a few small quibbles with the book (for instance, the crime that starts the book is never fully explained), but it doesn't really detract from your enjoyment. Best of all, I liked Britt.

Ms. Smith takes us down one plot path and then suddenly veers off the road, goes another way entirely. The way all the plotlines converged was very effective. And I had no problem with the characters or their believability. Ana and Andrew were drawn together because they recognized that they were both damaged -- by their sad, empty childhoods and by the ugly things they had seen on the job. The way Ana so completely related to Julia, the teenage victim whose abduction she was investigating, made it plausible that she would feel great empathy for her lover. And then there was the lust -- a powerful motivation indeed. An earlier reviewer compared Ana to Kinsey Milhone. While I appreciate Grafton's heroine enormously, I think Ana has more in common with Patricia Cornwell's brilliant but deeply flawed Kay Scarpetta.	2003-10-15

But at any rate, Taraborelli has little integrity as a biographer. Yes, this book is entertaining. But it quotes detailed conversations neither the author nor his \\"sources\\" (many of whom are other tabloid writers or Kennedy hangers on) could have possibly known. Now for the theft -- I read Leamer's THE KENNEDY WOMEN, and recognized much of it here. So while this book is indeed a fun read, please don't take it seriously. I would have respected this entire endeavor more if it didn't pretend to be more than it was. Maybe, if it's ever reissued, the cover can be of Joan in a low bodice dress being ravaged by Teddy. Because that's all this book is -- a silly, fun, historical romance.	2003-10-11

As with the last of his books I read (JACKIE, ETHEL AND JOAN), Taraborelli regularly quotes specific conversations that he could not possibly have been privy to, nor was anyone else but the principals. (My favorite: the one where Grace tells Ranier to behave more like Louis B. Mayer. Gee, Randy, which one told you that? Gracie or the Prince?) Still, what he lacks in journalist integrity, he makes up for with honest affection for his subjects. He consistently looks at the Grimaldi family in the best possible light, which encourages the reader to care more about them -- even the embarrassing Stephanie and her sojurn with a circus are treated with more empathy than I thought possible. While you may not learn anything of substance from this book that you didn't know when you picked it up, you will come away with a new fondness for this sad, lovely Princess and her family.	2003-10-10

She devoured life with such ferocity and hunger that eventually circumstances devoured her. And Echols tells her story with literacy and passion, always carefully putting it into context. Janis shared chart dominance with Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin and Diana Ross. Imagine how she must have sounded coming out of your radio in those days! What a radical departure, what a unique talent. And Echols explains how much her unconventionality cost her. In addition to portraying Janis as an artist, moved by the music, she also unapologetically shows Janis as a career-oriented woman. I appreciated this, for the dominant male stars of the 60s (like Jagger and McCartney) are allowed and even applauded for making artistic decisions with an eye on the long-term impact they would have on their careers. The only thing I didn't like about THIS book was the author's ongoing critques of OTHER books. I don't care what Echols thought about Peggy Casserta's or Myra Friedman's books. Biography shouldn't be a competitive sport.	2003-09-26

The cover states clearly that it is about &quot;the love-hate relationship between Diana and the Media.&quot; Therefore anyone demeaning it because the cover isn't &quot;pretty&quot; or because it may be factually inaccurate by moments about incidents surrounding her death and funeral are completely missing the point. This book is not, strictly speaking, about the events of Diana's life but about how they were interpreted. And Mr. Levine shares some very unconventional, intelligent opinions on that subject. Some of it I disagree with (the life and continuing media fascination in Jacqueline Onassis disputes his assertion that the public loves celebrities for their accessibility; Jackie O was the most remote of celebrities and in her case it was her very unknowability that still intrigues us). But on one very important point, I agree with Mr. Levine whole-heartedly. In purely feminist terms, Diana was a heroine, not a victim. She was NOT a victim of the media or, ultimately, the Royal Family. She used the media and survived the Royal Family. And the reason the public adored her is that she went through the same stages every woman does, just on a grander scale and with better clothes. Diana was disappointed by love, longed for direction and meaning in life, loved her children, and was insecure about her looks. And before our eyes, she grew up to be a symbol of grace and generosity. She was transformed by her pain and hardship and she was victorious against the power elite -- and she used the press to win. Diana's memory deserves to be celebrated, not tsk-tsked over as though she had been some poor, helpless little thing. Diana accomplished so much with her own charm, energy and ingenuity. Ultimately, she was the victim of a drunk driver, and that could happen to any of us.	2003-09-18

I still don't quite believe the character of Elinor, which is too bad because the other characters are so carefully drawn. (I've always enjoyed the conversations between Mum and Dad; in this one my favorite is their debate over what caused hoof and mouth disease.) I read with amusement some of the less favorable reviews that said Becky was just as shallow as ever. Well, I for one am glad that Becky remains Becky because I enjoy her.

Parker's recent BACK STORY, and this book definitely benefits from the comparison. It's Turow's take on the 1960s that gripped me. Where Parker's take on the late 1960s and early 1970s is smug, judgemental and wholly unsympathetic, Turow manages to be both romantic and honest. Loyell Eddgar is at the center of both major plots -- the murder in the 90s and the radicalism of the 60s -- and he personifies the worst of &quot;The Revolution.&quot; A blowhard and a narcissist, he exploited issues like civil rights and the Viet Nam war to gain the power and attention he cannot live without. But in the characters of Sonny and especially young Seth, Turow captures the idealism, the pain, the compassion and the genuine desire to change the world for the better that was as much a part of that generation as its indulgence. And it's fascinating to revisit Sonny and Seth decades down the line, to see where the long, strange trip has taken them. This book tries to do a lot and isn't wholly successful on all points -- I'd have cut the romance during the trial to eliminate a little of the confusion. But on balance, it was a good, entertaining, thought provoking read.	2003-09-01

Not quite as much as the first installment, because I by now I have the concept down cold, but I was still very, VERY entertained. While I did find Becky's adventures in the Big Apple funny, my absolute favorite part was her trip to the convent near the beginning of the book. It just completely captured how Becky just doesn't get it (but the nun did, and I adored how she convinced Becky to take advantage of the gift shop). Luke is a bit more fleshed out in the volume, which is a plus, but his mother was written in such a black/white way that it was hard to believe her. (Ditto Tom's bride.) Still, these are minor gripes in a book filled with delightful characters like Suze, Mel, Mr. and Mrs. Bloomwood and Luke's American business partner. I look forward to the third installment. (BTW, I realize why I keep picturing Becky as a redhead. She and Luke seem strangely reminiscent of the Riccardos. Like Lucy, Becky is always willing to tell a whopping lie when the truth will do, and she's always trying to hide her shopping from her man. And these habits get her into the wildest jams.)	2003-08-24

I love the Spenser series and enjoyed the first two Sunnys, so I feel as disappointed by this book as I would be an unfaithful lover. It contains every element that's ever annoyed me about Parker's writing, and made them even more grating! First of all, the characters. Sunny and Spike are in their 30s and listen to WWII era music and quote Fred Allen. I guess Parker is too lazy to even try to include an appropriate pop culture reference. Then there's the savvy author who is selling her book to Hollywood, who knows all about agents and movie stars and making deals. And she is SHOCKED that Spike is gay? Yes, I can see where a woman who lives in a major metropolian area and rubs elbows with show biz types would find gay men exotic and unusual. COME ON! And Sunny and Julie's conversations are always about \\"deep, important\\" male/female issues, the way Phil Donahue's TV show was. Could these two talk about the sweater sale at Filene's for a change? Or if they must ruminate about the battle of the sexes ad nauseum, could we bring the dialog out the 1970s at least? Readers of the Spenser series are used to Parker returning again and again to the issues of feminism, therapy and the way the straight world views gays. In this book, he takes the opportunity to bludgeon us with them, and the characters suffer mightily.<br />And then there's the plot. Add me to the list of readers who found it hard to believe that the shrink didn't realize that the Sunny Randall and Sonjia Burke were one in the same. Her disguise did seem about as elaborate as Clark Kent's.<br />Yet I enjoyed FAMILY HONOR and PERISH TWICE enough that, should Parker decide to resurrect Sunny again, I'll try to spend a little more time with her. I just wish he'd work a little harder on what were once his strengths: dialog and plot development. I prefer reading about people I can believe actually live and breathe, and none of this characters remotely came to life.	2003-08-18

While I enjoyed the Bridget Jones books, Rebecca more closely resembles me and my friends when we were 25. Whereas Bridget's main obsessions were men and weight, with us, it was shopping and figuring out how to handle money. Heaven help me, I even did some of these things when I was living the trendy single life in Chicago -- dreaming that an elusive lotto win would rescue me, sending Visa an unsigned check to buy a week or two, etc. So I wasn't the only one! There's a whole sisterhood of us that even spans the ocean! And this book nails the joy of consumerism, the sensual thrill of shopping like nothing else I've ever read. And the humiliation of having your credit card rejected. I'm glad I eventually matured and became responsible, but I certainly enjoyed this warm and witty walk down memory lane. And I think in its way, this book explores a legitimate problem: Just as girls and young women struggle with the body images portrayed in magazines, they are struggling with how to have the fashionista wardrobe and accessories we are told we need to have. Marie Claire and Glamour never show you how to accessorize the blouses from Jaclyn Smith's Kmart collection, do they? Maybe they should -- maybe girls and young women should be presented with more realistic expectations of the world. In the meantime, I'm happy to laugh along with Becky and Suz and Luke and Mr. and Mrs. Bloomwood and all the other characters I enjoyed so much. PS Part of why I loved this book so much is that I had just finished Candace Bushnell's 4 BLONDES.

I love the HBO series, SEX & THE CITY, and assumed that it was a reflection of Candace Bushnell's writing. How wrong I was! These four are neither sophisticated nor witty. Instead they are smug, judgemental and utterly devoid of warmth or empathy. I know that casual sex exists, and I am mature enough to know that this doesn't automatically result in blindness or punishment by God. I also know that major cities are populated by fashionistas. (I live in Chicago myself -- a wonderful, completely alive city that these four would only fly over en route to LA.) But what I have seen in my own life, and on the HBO series, as well, is that attractive, hip women who unabashedly enjoy sex with men also enjoy friendship with other women. No one in this book actually LIKES anyone! What a depressing quartet to have spent time with! Camaraderies seems as foreign to them as shopping at Sears. The only entertainment I got was figuring out that Diane Moon/Courtney Love connection. Still haven't a clue as to who Tanner is. (Jack Nicholson? Nah.

Now of course Grisham is not the writer Fitzgerald is, and the ending is no where near as satisfying as that classic's heartbreaking finale. But Clay is much like Gatsby, a man who does whatever it takes to win the love and respect of his dream girl -- a girl who clearly represents more than she actually is. Gatsby did business with gangsters and bootleggers, Clay goes into mass torts to make his fast buck. Gatsby had Meyer Wolfsheim to show him the ropes, Clay has Patton French. Both men gain their fortunes and lose their souls. And that is a classic American story and when it's told well -- or at least entertainingly, as it is here -- it never gets old. Like many reviewers on this board, I was pretty appalled at the way Tequila Watson is tossed aside here. I hope that Grisham's cynicism is not a real reflection of today's America.	2003-08-04

And that's what this book is: decent, highly professional Parker. I enjoyed this book more than either POTSHOT or WIDOW'S WALK.<br />That said, Sunny Randall is a retread of Spenser, and this book is a retread of an excellent Spenser book: LOOKING FOR RACHEL WALLACE. There may be subtle differences, but I wonder if these delicate nuances would be so appreciated if it was a different author who borrowed so liberally from Parker's previous works. As it is, if Parker wants to plagerize Parker, who are we to quibble? I am willing to overlook and perhaps even enjoy it, but not to deny it.<br />The major strength of this book is the weakness of the recent Spenser stories, and that is the sleuth's age. Sunny is half Spenser's age, which makes it easier for us to accept her in this role and gives us many more years for us to enjoy her company. And I do enjoy Sunny, Rosie and even her interplay with her ex and her dysfunctional family. And even though the story is very similar to the Rachel Wallace plot, it unfolds nicely. <br />But as you read these books, you cannot help but see actual \\"lifts\\" from the Spenser series. For heaven's sake, Rosie even rolls on her outdoor treasures before she eats them, just like Pearl; and let's not rehash the myriad similarities between Julie and Susan or Spike/Richie and Hawk. Unless the people (and dogs) in Boston all come from exactly the same mold, Mr. Parker is recycling.	2003-07-23

This time, it's LORD OF THE FLIES and how contemporary its themes remain. It's this little extra that Gillian Roberts always adds, this something that makes the books about more than solving the crime at hand, that I enjoy. Which is not to say that this book isn't fun. CK is as adorable as ever, and while there is less Macavity than I would have liked, there are the charming MacKenzie parents added for entertainment. And Amanda's sharp observations about teaching and Havermeyer are always great. Only one complaint -- I figured out the who in this whodunit LONG before Amanda did. The &quot;why&quot; was pretty clear early on, too. So as much as I enjoyed it, I came away feeling a twinge of disappointment.

Knowing this will make me appreciate his work that much more. Does it bother me that the biographer writes as if she was in the room for some of the conversations? Not really.

Most notably, it introduces us to Susan Silverman -- at this point a high school guidance counselor but later to become a psychologist. And she is why this is a 4-star, not a 5-star, review. By my lights, she remains the weakest element of this entertaining and evergreen series. Spenser is almost instantly besotted by her, and I have no idea why. She is pretty and dresses well, but isn't the greater Boston metropolitan area filled with attractive fashionistas? She doesn't quite instantly fall into bed with Spenser, but then again, I'm sure that there are many women who don't automatically have sex with private detectives they meet at work. Her insights are not that brilliant. While she is not as high maintenance here as she becomes in future books, nor as pretentious, she is still not all that remarkable. All this said, the mystery itself is wonderful. The plot twists kept me intrigued. And Spenser himself is fascinating. True to his code and filled with compassion and integrity, he is still my favorite sleuth with a series. (Apologies to Nero and Archie!)	2003-07-11

The author has no point to make, no idea to illuminate, beyond We Are Right and They Are Evil. (Not even \\"wrong,\\" but \\"evil.\\") And I think this attitude is dangerous. This country was based on, and thrives from, free speech and healthy debate. Ms. Coulter's demonizing doesn't encourage meaningful debate. If you disagree with her, you are unAmerican. There are conservatives, or libertarians, that I enjoy hearing from. For example, I've learned from paying attention to Bill Kristol and Bill O'Reilly. I believe these are reasoned gentlemen who are interested in fairly advancing their points of view for the good of the country, not for the good of their wallets or their public profiles. Ms. Coulter could learn from them. But I don't think she ever will. Her mind is obviously locked tight as a drum. How sad for all of us that she uses the privilige of the public forum to discourage the exchange of ideas! I wonder what our founding fathers would think of her.	2003-07-09

Who among us has 20/20 hindsight and complete objectivity about our own lives? This book must be judged as a MEMOIR, not as a scholarly examination of a Presidency. Unlike Dallek's great book on JFK or McCullough's on Truman, Sen. Clinton does not have the benefit of objectivity or decades of perspective on decisions that were made in the not-that-long-ago 1990s. To call her book \\"dishonest\\" is ingenuous. If, for example, Frank McCourt's brothers remember the incidents in ANGELA'S ASHES differently than he does, is he a \\"liar?\\" I'm also confused by all these uncredited allegations of ghostwriters. I haven't read them regarding this book anywhere but on this board. Who says the book is ghostwritten, and how objective is that source? As you can see from some of the more vitriolic reviews on this board, Sen. Clinton and her husband are polarizing figures, to say the least. Such uncredited allegations just give credence to her claims that there are factions \\"out to get\\" the Clintons.	2003-07-05

Jackie needed to make a &quot;successful&quot; marriage that would land her &quot;real money,&quot; and time was running out. After all, she was 24 years old! JFK needed a wife, a good and presentable CATHOLIC wife, to enhance his image with voters. From these cynical beginnings, according to Klein, a marriage was born and eventually, true love. Over the decade they spent together, Jack and Jackie came to appreciate and depend on one another, bonded by unique experiences and the love of their children. I have one quibble with the point-of-view of this book: Jackie became one of the most influential women of the century because of her marriage to this powerful man. To pretend otherwise is just silly. And for Klein to insist that Jackie was &quot;important&quot; politically is also silly. This is not Hillary Clinton, Rosalyn Carter, or Eleanor Roosevelt we're talking about here. She represented her nation well overseas, honored her husband's memory gallantly and worked hard at being a good mother. There is much to admire about her. But she was neither a policy wonk nor a political powerhouse, but a glamorous celebrity, and therefore historically, she was no where near as important as her first husband.	2003-07-04

The events that bring us to the climax are intriguing and shocking (and grisly, as a warning to anyone not familiar with Cornwell). The interpersonal relationships among the &quot;good guys&quot; -- Kay, Benton, Marino, Janet and Lucy -- added texture and enhanced the suspense. And I enjoyed moving from Virginia to New York to Hilton Head with Kay. BUT this ending! So much action brings us to a very unsatisfying climax. Throughout the book, we hear at least two characters muse as to why the villain behaves as he does. This made me want to hear a definitive answer. And we never get it. The book ends so abruptly, you would think Ms. Cornwell simply ran out of paper.	2003-06-29

What a fascinating protagonist/villain! At times he made my skin crawl, at times he broke my heart. Not many authors spend this much time on credible character development. Not many books feature a character with so much depth and contradiction. I truly cared what happened to Robbie and Evon (and even Stan and George). The plights of Robbie's wife and mother are handled compassionately, too -- unusual in a thriller. It was the feeling I'd invested in these characters that kept me from ever being bored as I followed them on this adventure of ethics, loyalty and betrayal. BTW: I was interested as I read these reviews by how many insist on comparing Turow to Grisham. I read a lot of mysteries, and you seldom see readers comparing, say, Grafton to Paretsky or Cornwell. Maybe it's because the genre of legal thriller is still pretty wide open, with these two men dominating it. At any rate, there's room on my bookshelf for both Grisham and Turow.	2003-06-07

That's why I'm surprised to be rating this autobiography with 4 stars. I wanted to get the dish on Elvis, and yes, it's here. But there's more, too. She's refreshingly honest about the duality of her nature -- the onstage strumpet who can (to borrow a phrase) start a heat wave by letting her seat wave coexists with the &quot;good girl&quot; who brought friends with her on dates so she wouldn't have to be alone with a man before she was ready; the dutiful daughter who couldn't bear to disappoint her parents coexists with the reckless woman who truthfully, regretfully admits to having ended marital arguments by roaring off on her Harley with a good deal of alcohol in her system. It must be hard for her to live her life with, as she refers to it, &quot;the two Ann-Margrets.&quot; I found that, and her enduring love story with Roger, to be the best and most surprising aspects of the book.	2003-05-31

Kennedy, 1917-1963	Books	4	25	26	N	Y	The truth about an American hero	This is the second JFK book I've read within the last six months (the first being Perret's JACK), and have enjoyed them both. What a complicated man Kennedy was! Within him were both idealism and pragmatism, humanitarianism and reckless disregard. Yes, he had a prodigious sex life and yes, he hid his health problems from the American public. And yes, he was a hero. Studying those sides of his character do not constitute \\"assassination\\" -- no one who actually read this book can say that -- any more than understanding Lincoln's melancholia diminishes our 16th President. This is NOT a hot, gossipy book. Instead of a sexy beach read, this is serious and scholarly. In addition to handling the sexual aspects of the Kennedy story in a realistic, nonsensational way, Dallek presents the medical history as though we are adults and can handle it. I also appreciated the way Dallek ended the book. The assassination is often handled as sensationally as Kennedy's sex life. Not here. No gory passages, no lurid conspiracy theories. Instead the book ends with an exploration of why Kennedy still captures our imagination, why his short Presidency still resonates. I found these last passages about Kennedy appealing to this country's \\"better angels\\" especially moving. This eloquent explanation of why JFK is still one of our heroes would not have had the same impact if the hundreds of pages that came before it weren't as credible.	2003-05-25

This is my second Hiassen (the first being the delightful StripTease) and I'm sure I'll be back for more. This is one very funny writer with a keen eye for South Florida customs and mores (I visit there every year). The basic idea of the book -- two very different lottery winners with two very different ideas of how to spend the loot -- was intriguing. But credibility was strained far more often here than in his earlier effort. Somehow in that book, once I agreed to join Hiassen through the looking glass, everything made sense. Here, there were some characters I just didn't buy. (Amber -- waitress/kidnap victim -- Tom's estranged wife and his editor, to be specific.) It felt like the author was trying to be outrageous and his self conscious wackiness just got annoying. But as I said, this is clearly a talented man and I shall give him another try soon.	2003-05-24

And I enjoyed it. Seldom in the series does our hero behave less than heroically (Spenser even makes reference to his outfit with the cape and the &quot;S&quot; on his chest). I liked this more humble, more human, more fallible Spenser. The character of Rachel is hard to warm up to at first (and I consider myself a feminist), yet I like that, too. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, even humorless feminist authors. And Susan actually adds something to this story. Her insights are valuable and move the action along. It helps to remind us every now and again why Spenser puts up with the often exasperating Dr. Silverman. In all, a wonderful read.	2003-05-04

It was great to backtrack and discover what has become one of my favorite books in the series. The story is SO imaginative and original! The suspense is taut and kept me on the edge of my seat. And most of all, there is Kay, a three dimensional, refreshingly human heroine. No, she isn't perfect. As the possibility of an affair with a married man arose, I wasn't &quot;appalled&quot; by Kay, I was heartbroken for her. Driven by work, shattered by lost love, reaching for someone to bring her back to life emotionally ... her feelings may not be noble but they certainly seemed human to me. A powerful woman in a controversial, conventionally male field, and reviewers ask why so many people hate her? It seems very realistic that the head of a high-profile state agency would find herself with enemies. While I have no real criticism of this book, I do have a comment on the rest of the series. Part of why I enjoyed this one so much is Lucy. As the series progresses, Lucy's life gets so complicated and convulated and dangerous that it is her character, not Kay's, that strains credibility. It was refreshing to revisit a time when Lucy was a teenager whose biggest (immediate) problem was access to a car.	2003-05-03

And, thank heaven, I have not had to go through what this gallant woman endured. And endure she has! She came back from the most hideous abuses a woman can suffer, and then had to deal with a long physical recovery and the public's insistance on politicizing her violation -- which would have seemed to me to be yet another violation, and added pressure I certainly didn't need when fighting to recover from my physical and mental faculties. Yet Trisha managed to focus on the positive, to take strength from love and support from family and friends (many she'll never meet) and was nourished by her spiritual side. If Trisha profits from my purchase of this book, I am glad. For I feel I profited from her story, her strength and her honesty. And I'm sure that there are countless women all across the country who do not feel that the brutalization of another woman is \\"yesterday's news,\\" and will also feel inspired by this wonderful story. Trisha is living proof that the human spirit can rise above anything!	2003-04-24

I was a child in the Chicagoland area when the nurses were killed, and I understood (superficially, at least) what Speck had done and the impact it had on the adults around me. \\"Richard Speck\\" became like \\"The Bogeyman,\\" or the other monsters that haunt children's nightmares. So as an adult, I was eager to confront the demon of my girlhood by reading this detailed and serious study. I was not prepared for how genuinely horrible the crimes were, especially against the backdrop of those more innocent times. I had not been aware of how close Speck came to getting away. I had real admiration for the lawyers, jurors and judge who worked to ensure that our system of justice worked -- even for this piece of human flotsam. Most of all, I rediscovered a real-life heroine, Corazon Amurao. No one should have had to endure what she lived through that summer night, and the way she stood up to Speck in court was awe-inspiring. Hers is a truly indomitable spirit. But I'm still as afraid Richard Speck today as I was more than 35 years ago. He was my introduction to evil, and it seems that the killers who have come after him, from Bundy to Gacy to the Washington snipers, have just gotten stronger and meaner and smarter.	2003-04-21

Archie finds himself in the publishing world, helping Wolfe sort out scandals, plagarism and murder.

Ms. Wells is a very good writer who knows these characters well and clearly cares about them. Each of our narrators has a distinct voice and point of view and was very believable. Siddalee, especially, is an admirable, three-dimensional young woman who comes alive here. And yet (here comes the ambivalence) I am appalled that just about everyone is so enchanted by Vivi, dahling!, that they forgive her just about everything. And worse, I get the impression that the author feels the reader is supposed to feel this way, as well. Vivi is a narcissist who abuses those who love her most. The fact that she speaks colorfully and has kept her complexion despite 40 years of smoking, drinking and drugging does not make her any more lovable. Her own painful childhood is an explanation, not an excuse. I would have enjoyed this story more if the characters were less in love with Vivi and more involved with the lives of her poor children. I felt the most admirable characters, beyond Sida, were the couple who lived at Pecan Grove and worked for the Walkers for decades. The brief glimpse into the lives of these two was fascinating and left me wanting more. I hope someday Ms. Wells gives them their own story someday.	2003-04-19

And Julie the shrink bears a passing resemblance to Susan the shrink. Rosie eats off chopsticks, just like Pearl. Sunny's ex-husband provides extra muscle, underworld connections, and makes people uncomfortable by remaining menacingly still, just like Hawk. And Millicent is a mix between April Kyle and Paul Giacommin. So I guess if you wanted to brand this work as derivative, I wouldn't be able to convincingly defend it. BUT I adore the Spenser books and have feared that as Parker's original PI grows older (he's in his 60s now) and retires, there would be no new Parker character to take his place. Now there's Sunny. I enjoyed this tale of sex, mystery, love and redemption. The plot was interesting, the characters comfortable and compelling, and the performance by Andrea Thompson was exceptional. (OK, she said \\"Betty Hutton\\" instead of \\"Betty Patton\\" once, but I thought that was funny.) I've heard that Sunny was created for Helen Hunt, but Parker has hit the jackpot with Thompson. If there's ever a Sunny film, she certainly deserves a crack at the title role.	2003-04-18

But if you're looking for a thriller with no redeeming value other than that it's a light, fun read, this is it. The plot itself had lots of twists and turns and while the characters were stereotypes, in a book like this that adds to the charm and fun. My only real complaint about this great trashy novel is the inclusion of Josephine in the most dangerous escapades. It was highly manipulative to put a dog in harm's way like that, and inconsistent, too. If our hero doesn't take Grandma's poodle with him to drag bars, why would he include her on a shootout with a hitman? Instead of putting the pooch in peril, Mac, leave her home!	2003-04-13

This book was imaginative, observant and perhaps witty, but NOT funny. The neglect of Grayer/Grover and the exploitation of domestic help was highly credible, but not amusing in the slightest. Yes, I believe there are people like the X's, people who are simply too busy to care for their children. And it's important to note that this is not a couple where both work out of economic necessity and an honest desire to give their child a wonderful life. The X's see Grayer only as an extension of themselves and a reflection of their lives, just like the furnishings in their apartment. I was grateful for the glimpse into a life that is different than mine, and my heart literally ached for Grayer. And Caitlin, Connie and Nanny, too, but most of all, Grayer.

They chronicle how quickly she moved, from folk-singing &quot;beatnik&quot; to counter-culture icon, and how even this lightening pace wasn't fast enough for her. And they reveal a longing for acceptance that we all sensed from her stage persona and her music. Hearing the dates on the letters as we move with her from Texas to SF to the world, I shuddered, thinking &quot;So little time left, dear, and you don't even know it.&quot; Of course, none of us knows what life has in store for us, and that makes Janis' story in her own words all the more moving. That Laura loved her sister and wished she knew her better comes through in these pages. The story is unique to the Joplins, yet universal to all, and I recommend it. I subtracted one star for the reading by Debra Winger. At times I thought she was an inspired choice. Her smoky voice is so reminiscent of Janis'. But at other times I was exasperated, when Ms. Winger stumbled and gave me the impression she was reading these words for the first time.	2003-04-05

Fortunately, shortly before the fatal shot was fired, the dead man had the foresight to invite Hercule Poirot for a visit. Thank goodness he is there to unravel things, as only he can!

The story is original, the wisecracks are genuinely funny and not tiresomely \\"cute,\\" the characters are true-to-form without being predictable. In short, I loved it!<br />The characters have taken on lives of their own, and their interplay adds texture to the story. I loved Spenser's discomfort with Darryl's cautious reaction to Pearl. And I especially enjoyed Hawk's observation about Susan/Spenser conversation: he points out that first one of them says something cryptic, then the other one simply agrees. So true!<br />Spenser gets very introspective about his chosen line of work. I wonder if that, combined with the introduction of Jesse Stone, means that Spenser might be preparing us for his retirement. And maybe it's time. While I admit I loved this book, I can't shake the knowledge that these characters are getting long in the tooth chronologically. Spenser served in Korea and quit smoking 40 years ago. That would put him in his 60s. Since he boxed professionally alongside Hawk, Hawk must be in that same range, yet women of all ages keep throwing themselves at him. And Susan, so beautiful and firm of flesh, can't be much behind them. Is the Charles River really the fountain of youth? Sorry, but credibility is strained.

And the victims should never be forgotten, nor defined soley as those who lost their lives. This book expands the circle of victims to make the reader ache for everyone Bundy touched -- the dead girls themselves, the mothers and friends who must somehow accept the unacceptable, the dedicated but frustrated law enforcement officers who feel helpless to stop the carnage, even the officers of the court who must defend the indefensible ... Ann breathes life into them all. <br />Then there's the havoc Bundy brought to his supporters. Ann, Meg, Stephanie, Sharon, his mother ... they all loved him, cried for him and fought for him until the evidence of his guilt became too overwhelming and repellent. And then these women had to live with the \\"what if's.\\" (What if I'd realized earlier that the \\"Ted killer\\" was my Ted? Could I have saved lives? Was there something I did that made him slaughter lovely, promising young women -- girls like me or my daughters?) He may not have strangled, maimed or wiped these women off the face of the earth, but he left them battered and bruised emotionally. It's one of the measures of what a monster he was that he didn't seem to notice, understand or care what his evil compulsion did to those who loved him. Ms. Rule makes their (and her own) plight so understandable, so human, that you feel you are walking in their shoes. By the end of the book, you count these women among Bundy's victims, too.<br />Ms. Rule is not the writer Capote is -- there's no poetry here, and her prose never reaches the level of art you'll find on any page of IN COLD BLOOD. But her personal involvement and gift for observation make this book a classic of the genre, as well.	2003-03-19

I've worked for a big-time national retailer and know how sleazy some (okay, many but not all) buyers can be. But there is nothing in that line of work to prepare  a woman for bounty hunting. Especially a woman who has never fired a gun or seen a dead body before. I believe in my heart that if Stephanie Plum were indeed a real woman, at one crucial point in the story she would have taken Morelli's advice and become a shampoo girl at a local salon.<br />Still, there is much in this book that was fun, and I look forward to future installments.	2003-03-18

Parker's observations on the Strip and its denizens are very accurate, and very funny. And all the essentials that give the Spenser saga its charm are all here: banter between Spenser and Hawk, Susan's idiosyncracies, even Pearl eating Chinese food. It's the mystery, such as it is, and the characters that are lacking. Shallow, dumb thugs and their pathetic womenfolk get themselves all tangled up, and Hawk and Spenser unravel it. Yawn.	2003-03-04

It's this passion that carried me through this at-times difficult book.<br />I agree that Cornwell displays terrific arrogance by titling this book \\"Case Closed.\\" She is presenting nothing more here than her theory. A firmly believed and well researched theory yes, but certainly not definitive. I can see where this would turn readers off.<br />On the other hand, Cornwell's disgust with the crimes and with the public's fascination with the monster that was Jack the Ripper is real, personal and fascinating. She names the victims and fights to make them three dimensional. She portrays the times, mores and situations the victims found themselves in with realism and compassion. She seems intent on avenging them and bringing them justice. Her passion, while laudable, certainly gets in the way of her objectivity.<br />In all, this book reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, the film about the crime of the century (perhaps of my lifetime) that I am far more familiar with. While that film has its share of inaccuracies and should under no circumstances be interpreted as a definitive history, it's still an important work about a crime that haunts us still. Likewise, Cornwell's book is a valuable addition to the dialog about Jack the Ripper, his times and his crimes. And those not to be forgotten poor women, with their desperate lives of oppression, deprivation, poverty and finally horrible death.<br />Beware! None of the reviews I've read thus far have mentioned how really grisly this book is at times, even by Cornwell standards. One reviewer actually said he laughed while reading this book. Trust me, I found no laughs in it whatsoever! If you pick up this book, please know that it details crimes of genuine horror.	2003-02-05

Not for the research -- as many of the other reviewers and the footnotes section of the book attest, most of the information has been available to us in other forms. But for the insights and attitude. Perret seems intent on making Kennedy human, and he succeeds. Kennedy is at once a visionary legislator (one of the first advocates of abolishing the mandatory retirement age and an early friend to both labor and Israel) and a bored playboy/senator (if a bill didn't interest him, he couldn't be bothered with it). A reckless womanizer who didn't really care about the impact his escapades had on his wife or career, yet one of the first politicians to recognize the power of the women's vote. And perhaps it was his confidence in his own rampaging heterosexuality that made him so comfortable with homosexual men -- something not very common in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Most of all, Jack managed to balance overwhelming ambition and opportunism with a secret but very strong core of idealism and conscience. I wish Perret had been a bit more discerning in choosing his sources. (I mean, J. Randy Taraborelli and Seymour Hersh, for heaven's sake!) But this complaint did not detract from readability of the book. It left me feeling profoundly sad about what this nation lost nearly 40 years ago, and how different the world today would be if JFK, for all his myriad faults, had lived out his natural life.	2003-01-22

Stewart is a very rare writer, indeed -- especially in regards to the Clintons. He's a genuine reporter looking for the facts and he appears to have no agenda (meaning he's not the apologist Gail Sheehy is, nor is he the demonizer Anne Coulter is). He presents the failed land deal of Whitewater for what it was -- a bad and perhaps even improper investment that was made to look illegal by the stumbling, bumbling and arrogance of the Clintons. Ditto for Hillary's commodities trading. There are no high crimes here, and if the First Lady hadn't been so determined to protect her privacy it may have just evaporated. If only Bill and Hillary had listened to lawyer (and Watergate veteran) Nussbaum and made their records/returns available in the first place, taxpayers would have been spared millions of dollars in investigations and the President would have been better able to concentrate on health care, education, foreign policy and all the other issues he discussed in the campaign. And if a special prosecutor hadn't already been in place, it's possible none of us would even know the name &quot;Monica Lewinsky.&quot; It almost made me ache for what might have been.<br />Stewart makes the complicated accessible and breathes life into Little Rock and White House denizens. Jim MacDougall, Nussbaum and especially Vince Foster are more sympathetic, human and ultimately tragic than ever before. And I wonder how new This Week commentator George Stephanopolous feels about this book ... This book does not depict him in his finest hour.	2003-01-09

The premise of &quot;girl power,&quot; the themes of female friendship and the mother/daughter bond ... it's an ambitious, good-hearted book. Sidda is entirely sympathetic and I enjoyed her journey. But the author put way too much effort into making Vivi into what Holly Golightly (a far more original, believable heroine) would call &quot;a wild thing,&quot; and the results are nowhere near as endearing. Ms. Wells created this supposedly vibrant Vivi at the expense of other characters. Teensy, Caro and Neice are never given the depth required to make their friendship genuinely moving. And Shep is almost invisible -- and not in the &quot;he left her alone with too much responsibility&quot; fashion that the author intends. He's merely a shadow of a character, with no real dimension. Still there's enough style, warmth and affection here to make me willing to pick up LITTLE ALTARS someday. (But not enough to make reading the sequal a priority.)	2003-01-07

The writer clearly has talent and wit. I would have liked to see her apply a little less pretension and a little more compassion to her insights -- her style seems downright defensive at times. (&quot;See? Even though I clean houses I'm still smart and literate!&quot;) This edge rather undermined the more egalitarian message of her work. Still, at times it was very funny and it was always very interesting. <br />I'm very glad I read this BEFORE I read some of these reviews! Geez! You'd think the author of this harmless little tome was to housecleaning what Robin Williams is to film developing in ONE HOUR PHOTO! Yes, she judges her employers harshly. I'm in a very different profession, and I know I judge MINE harshly, too. And, as both a boss and a woman who has a cleaning lady come in twice a month, I'm quite sure I get judged harshly, as well. Get over it, people! You're fighting basic human nature here. (And if it bothered you THAT much, perhaps you should look at how you treat those in your employ.)	2002-12-23

These two men could not be more different in terms of work ethic, personal style, taste, etc. Yet they are held together by mutual respect and -- as illustrated by this colorful installment -- a very healthy disrepect for authority. Here we find Wolfe confronted by an institution he would enjoy tweaking even more than the NYPD, and that's the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The murder itself really is not that important to the story. The real story is Wolfe's elaborate (and boy, is it ever elaborate!) plan to sting the Feds. If you're looking for a complex whodunit, look elsewhere. But if you enjoy the series and the main characters of Goodwin, Wolfe and Cramer, curl up with this one and prepare to smile often.	2002-12-19

Sure Ann Rule's books follow a formula. And, like TV's LAW &amp; ORDER, it's a successful way to tell a crime story. In this book, as in all Ann's books, there's the set up, the crime, the investigation, and the final judgement. Her books aren't fine literature, like Truman Capote's IN COLD BLOOD, but classics like that come along very rarely. What Ms. Rule does well is to keep the victim in as clear focus as the villain. Often in books of this genre, the victim and the impact of the crime are lost because criminals such as Blackthorn are so complicated and interesting. Not so here. Shelia, Jamie, Carrie, the older daughters and the quads are never forgotten.	2002-12-11

I prefer trains to planes, I love romance and mystery, and I'm a white-knuckle flyer, so I came to this Christmas saga *wanting* to enjoy it. But alas, I didn't.<br />It's an interesting premise -- a holiday tale of second chances and redemption set against the backdrop of train travel. The author clearly enjoyed his journey and this story did make me want to climb aboard Amtrak again. His sincere admiration for train travel and those who work the rails is infectious. (I've taken this very train from Chicago to Kansas City and back more than once and have always had a wonderful time).<br />Now, for the bad: Post-9/11, the behavior Tom exhibits that is the catalyst for the train ride is obnoxious and dangerous. He's the kind of guy you're behind at the metal detector that makes you want to yell, &quot;Lighten up! They're just doing their jobs and it's for our safety, after all!&quot; And it's as though Tom seems to think that the lack of security on Amtrak is a good thing. Again, after 9/11, who thinks that's a wise view?<br />Then there's the &quot;humor.&quot;  The dialog is so forced that it never even coaxed a smile from me. The mystery was completely lacking in tension. And if you can't guess how the romance will turn out, you've never seen a Lifetime made-for-TV movie.<br />If I were a teacher, I'd give this an &quot;A&quot; for inspiration but a &quot;C-&quot; for execution.	2002-12-07

All the elements are there -- Archie, Fritz, Wolfe, beer, orchids, etc. But this is one of the later books in the series and there's a certain ennui evident. The mystery seemed over plotted, the characters under developed, and any genuine charm was missing. Of course even subpar Nero Wolfe is entertaining, so I'm not sorry I read it.  I just enjoyed the earlier books so much more, and seeing the series go downhill is depressing.	2002-11-30

Let's see ... Susan drags Spenser into a case he doesn't really want, Spenser wisecracks and offends everyone in authority, Hawk provides trustworthy and able-bodied support ... same old, same old.  The story itself isn't very compelling or interesting until the end. That's when Spenser shows us what makes him special. It's his attitude toward Jill Joyce, the care he devotes to her, and the offhanded way he delivers it (as though it's just his duty as a human being) that I found out of the ordinary and very moving.	2002-11-27

(Was she with her birth mother? Did she run away? Does anyone who knew her care?) Kinsey was smart enough and lucky enough to build a series of surrogate families -- beginning with her neighbor Henry and now including the two elderly cops. This support system gives her a strength the young murder victim didn't have. There are other women in this story, one is a girl whose home life was also very difficult who dreamt of better, more stable future with the boy next door, another loves too well but not too wisely, a third is an adoring sister who knows more about her brother than she says. Against this backdrop, Kinsey is dealing with her own unresolved feelings about her mother, grandmother, aunts and cousins. The comparison of the lives of these women add texture and substance to the story that is unusual with books of this genre. The only reason I subtracted a star is the mystery itself. I figured out the killer's identity long before Kinsey did -- and I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer. I wish she put as much work on plot as she did on character.	2002-11-27

All her characters are terrifically, believably human -- even and especially Fancy Phil the mobster. And the story itself is a real page turner. All the clues are there, we uncover them along with Judith, and getting to the climax is one great ride. I believe what gave the story added texture was the variety of women profiled -- especially Nancy (a loyal friend and unfaithful wife), Emily (\\"the mouse\\"), Courtney (Martha Stewart run amok), and Judith (the empty nester with so much to give and to little to give it to).  I enjoyed the time I spent with them all.	2002-10-09

Olivia Nelson is a perfectly lovely society matron, not your typical murder victim. Her adoring husband is a respected, successful business man, or is he?  Her family life was ideal, or was it?  As Spenser unravels this case, we learn that few of the characters in this book are as they seem on the surface, including our hero himself. Brawny and wisecracking, he proves once again that he's gotten hidden depths (hidden from just about everyone but Susan, Hawk and us) and goes by his own code.  As a pure mystery, I've read better.  But as a multilayered, highly entertaining exercise in storytelling, I highly recommend it.	2002-09-30

Ms. Christie takes a little longer than usual to introduce us to all the characters -- all of whom will, of course, either become victims or suspects, except for the incomparable Hercule Poirot.  The mystery is centered around a real-life game of CLUE, played with real people, that's meant to be entertainment at a local fair. And then it goes terribly wrong. Tortured family relationships and issues of class and heritage complicate matters.  Just as the murder was introduced a little too slowly for my taste, its resolution was come upon a bit too abruptly.  But these are just quibbles. Suchet's performance as Poirot made this unabridged audio book a delight.	2002-09-30

Mulvaney takes the lives of the two most chronicled, photographed women of the 20th century and puts them in a fascinating new context. While there is little new here in terms of facts or photos, it's the writer's interpretation of this oft-told tales that make the book worth reading. (For example, I never realized how similar Jackie's and Diana's realtionships with their mothers-in-law were.) By contrasting the way these two world famous women played the roles most women are expected to play -- maiden, wife and mother -- he makes their extraordinary lives more relatable. Most fascinating of all to me was the cross-cultural note: It was Jackie, enigmatic to the end, who kept her private life private and maintained an almost-English &quot;stiff upper lip;&quot; it was Diana who openly, impusively shared her life with world in a more typically American fashion. And it remains Jackie's sense of mystery and Diana's vulnerabiity that continue to fascinate us, years after they're gone.	2002-09-13

It mixed believable characters, crime, antiques and a real, unique sense of place into a delicious stew. Eloise (Weezie) is a lovely, flawed heroine -- not at all Superwomen, but flesh and blood and very capable of making hysterical mistakes. Her relationships with family, friends, neighbors and men all ring true (eccentric, perhaps, but true nevertheless). The only reason that I subtracted a star is that I found it slow going in the beginning. I got a little impatient waiting for the action to really begin. Still, it was a great summer read.	2002-09-11

It's a fabulous idea and makes for very entertaining reading. While there is little new in this book about the lives of either of these well-documented ladies, the parallells Mulvaney draws between them gives the familiar information a fresh spin. (In particular, I'd never considered how similar their relationships to their formidable mothers-in-law were!) The cultural comments are interesting, too. Jackie maintained her (stereotypically English) \\"stiff upper lip\\" to the very end, while Diana took the more typically American, open approach to her life and her problems. And that's why I believe these women continue to fascinate. As much as we read about Jackie, we'll never feel we knew her -- she's an enigma we keep trying to solve. And it was Diana's very openness and accessibility that made her so appealing.	2002-09-05

Though she doesn't ever appear in the book in real time (it's her demise that is the catalyst for the action), she gave the story real texture. A respected professor with more than a touch of showgirl, a liberated woman with terrible taste in men, a lover of history and a lover of wealth ... Lola was a complex woman, and it's these complexities that seem to keep sending Alex and Chapman in different directions when trying to figure out the how's and why's of her death. The plot was intricate and involving. I also liked the unexpected and moving glimpse into Chapman's personal life. Unfortunately, I could not care less about Alex and her reporter/lover. Their dialog and their big fight seemed contrived. I think the book would have been just as good (if not better) without that subplot.	2002-07-08

Rumors abound that it was murder, disrupting morale. Nero and Archie are hired to either scotch the rumors or find the truth re: the mysterious death. These circumstances put Archie smack dab in the middle of hundreds of young working women -- many of them suspects, most of them of interest to Archie on other levels. This case gives him a chance to put many steak and wine dinners and many evenings of dancing on the old expense account, while he is in search of clues in this particularly confounding case. Neither the police nor Wolfe have much luck solving it for the longest time, and even Archie is frustrated by their lack of success (if not by the scenery he encounters along the way). This is very much Archie's story, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I figured out the mystery myself rather early on -- something I'm proud of, since that seldom happens to me in Wolfe stories. Still, I had a wonderful time with this book, and especially got a kick of Wolfe's snorting dismissals of Archie more personal interest in the ladies. I also enjoyed reading about women in the workplace in those long ago days. How times have changed!  All the women seemed to be in administrative positions. If they wanted power within the corporation, they got it through working for progressively more powerful men -- or in the case of Mrs. Pine, installing her husband on the board of directors. In that regard, this was a bit like unearthing a time capsule.	2002-06-18

And I learned more about it from MJF than I have from my only family. It's a difficult disease to talk about and truly understand because the future it promises is (at least as I write this) so bleak. This book is so frank and real that it has opened the doors of discussion within my family. For that, Michael J., I must thank you.<br />As a celebrity autobiography, it's also very good. He is more open and unsparing about himself that most stars who put pen to paper. (In that regard, he reminded me of Mary Tyler Moore and her autobiography of about six or seven years ago.)  I almost with Tracy Pollan would write her version of these events.  She is such a strong character in this book that I came away wondering if the thoughts and motivations applied to her by her husband were a true reflection.	2002-06-04

The Oprah of her day serves her guests the sponsor's carbonated drink on air, and one drops dead ... right there on live radio. Wolfe naturally figures out the killer's identity -- with a huge assist from Archie, just as naturally. Unfortunately, Wolfe doesn't do it in time to stop a trio of other murders from happening.  He seems to feel genuinely remorseful about this, as if he were angry at himself.  This isn't something we've seen often in Wolfe, and I found it appealing.  Also, reading this was like getting a valentine from a long-ago era.  While it may not have taken place that many years ago, today's world is far different from the one described here. Radio is not the prevalent broadcast media. Trains move at too leisurely a pace to be our primary mode of transportation anymore. And most of all, our criminals today are far more efficient and sophisticated.  I kept waiting for Wolfe to send Archie to the soda bottling plant to investigate, but it never happened. And then I realized it: no one even considered mass product tampering back in the day. It actually made me kind of wistful for those more innocent times.	2002-05-24

There's the death of Nathan Smith itself, the catalyst that sets everything in motion.  There's bank intrigue, shady real estate shenanigans, and an awful lot of dead bodies -- even by Spenser standards. There are references to previous cases, invoked by Susan and a cop. A father-daughter relationship is put to the test. A sacrifice is made for love. There's Hawk and Vinnie and a gay photographer who is so stereotypically flamboyant he makes Jack from WILL AND GRACE seem like a candidate for ABC's Monday Night Football broadcast booth. And on the subject of homosexuality, there's Susan's rather unconventional views on gender orientation and her problems with one of her patients, which leads her to hire the voracious Rita. It's a lot to keep straight, especially because I must admit I cared little about most of these auxilary machinations or the characters involved in them. The only secondary story I found moving was that of Pearl, the one-time wonder dog. When writing about the dog, Parker actually achieves the humanity he strives for in some of the other subplots.	2002-04-22

But it is not. Capote's writing lifts the Clutter tragedy well beyond the commonplace and transforms it into art. The poignant images he chose to include (the sad little dinner Perry serves in prison to his only friend, Dick's parents unknowingly going about their lives with a murder weapon propped up against the wall, Kenyon's radio, Bonnie pleading for Nancy's virtue, Nancy's beloved Babe sold at auction)  tug at the heart as surely as the details of the crime appall us.

I loved the mysterious adventures of those two ladies of a certain age in Birmingham and was hoping that Hannah and Kiki would fill the void.  While the author was very adept at creating a sense of time and place, and the story itself was taut and interesting, I must agree with the other reviewers who singled Kiki out for scorn.  Loud, shallow and man-hungry, she was a particularly silly and unattractive protagonist.  (Her opposite number in the Anne Carroll George books was Mary Alice, also loud, shallow and man-hungry, but also a possessed of uncommon common sense when the chips were down.)  Still, there was enough wit and skill on display in this first effort that I may give others in the series a try.  Maybe Kiki will be refined a bit more and will begin to grow on me.	2002-04-02

A wistful, infatuated Archie, an exasperated/exasperating Wolfe, police who are (as Wolfe himself would say) good enough at what they do but always a step or two behind, and an action-packed yet heartbreaking mystery.  So often books of this genre use murder merely as a catalyst for action.  By introducing the victims' families and giving them voice, Rex Stout makes us view the murders in terms of the very real pain they cause those who are left behind. But don't get me wrong -- this book is not a downer.  It's bright and clever and, as always, the Wolfe/Goodwin exchanges brought me many a smile.	2002-04-02

That's one of the delicious premises of this book. The mystery is a very good one.

The police go from adversaries to allies, and there's plenty of action to keep us on our toes.	2002-03-20

And it was interesting to witness NW and AG interacting, at least for a brief time, as equals instead of employer and employee. But the story itself was nonsense. I hate it when there is no way for the readers (or in this case, even the detectives) to figure out who the culprit is with the means at hand. If you're looking for another fun adventure with Archie and Mr. Wolfe, pick this book up. But if you want to read a conventional, challenging whodunit, pass it by.	2002-03-05

I found the basic premise engaging and universal:  A distant father, a wayward sibling and A LOT of cash.  Making it even richer are the unresolved issues with dear old dad that make the elder son determined to find out where the money came from. The man who gave him life, the man he thought he knew so well, must have had a secret side.  Also, I was fascinated by finding out how hard it is to do anything with that much cash without leaving a paper trail.  The common  fantasy of stumbling upon a pile of cash may actually be a nightmare in reality.  This book captured my interest with the first chapter and kept me intrigued through to the end. Since this is John Grisham and not John Steinbeck, that's all I really expected it to deliver.	2002-02-25

Archie's narration is biting and funny, never more than when's he's describing Wolfe's finger wagging and cheek folding (his euphemism for Nero's smile). And the mystery itself is rich and involving. Every suspect's motive is clearly established and understandable. In fact, my only complaint about this book is that Archie and Wolfe have already been together for appox. seven years when it opens.  I would have loved to have been there when they first met and work out their unique professional relationship. But I'm sure Wolfe would tell me that I'm quibbling.	2002-02-18

I'm from way north of the Mason-Dixon line (in the Land of Lincoln, no less!) and yet I adored this book.  The relationship between Mouse and Aunt Sister is not necessarily a Southern thing.  Anyone with a close-knit family and a taste for a little cozy intrigue should love this book. As with the other books in this lovely series, the mystery is neither too suspenseful nor violent (in other words, neither of these good old girls will ever be a Kay Scarpetta). Still, the story is engaging and the writer's attention to detail is once again delightful (in this book, it's an adventure in hair color that gets special attention).	2002-02-18

That said, I must admit that I found this one to be the weakest of the lot.  It's true that Mouse and Sister are never in any real danger, but unlike the other reviewer, I LIKED that twist.  I've always hated the idea of these two sweet old girls in physical danger.  However that reviewer was right -- there were way too many subplots and they never really got us anywhere.  Haley's Polish roaches, Patricia Ann's computer, Woofer vs the possum, even the investment club itself ... they really didn't add much to the unfolding mystery. There is so much extraneous stuff going on that I don't see how anyone -- including Mouse and Sister -- could have guessed the murderer without the scoundrel confessing.  Even so, it kept my interest and made me smile.  Even a subpar Southern Sisters book is fun.	2002-02-18

The value system that makes him different from those he pursues, and often even the cops, is spelled out here in both word and deed. It also helps us understand what draws him to and keeps him with the sometimes-exasperating Susan Silverman.<br />Even if you aren't a big fan of the series and are just looking for a read to get through a winter's day, this is a good choice. The mystery is a good one, with things of real value at stake (pardon the pun). Spenser takes us along every step of the way as he gets to the bottom of it, so the reader never feels cheated by the detective having information that we don't. (I must admit that perhaps the snow made me enjoy this book more than I ordinarily might have. Reading about Spenser watching baseball, eating hotdogs and peanuts and drinking beer in a great old ballpark is enough to make this girl downright misty-eyed as I dream of summers spent in my beloved Wrigley Field.)	2002-02-07

I thought this gave the story dimension.  Yes, the crimes are especially brutal, but they make sense within the context of the story -- where public perception is often more important than reality. My only reservation with the book is the character of Stella. For a woman who has been around crime, drugs and murder throughout her entire highly-successful career, she acts pretty stupidly when her own life and safety are concerned. I don't want to be a spoiler who gives away important plot points, but let's just say she doesn't respond to personal threats the way a seasoned officer of the court should	2002-02-07

It's a period piece, and the author created  a definite sense of time and place, which added texture to the story.  The story itself was unusual -- not your typical mystery fare.  I agree that Paul Chapin was a fascinating character.  His wife made me uncomfortable.  Her character was unpleasant and I didn't ever grasp what motivated her to do as she did.

What made reading it poignant is that I knew this would be the last time I spent with these characters.  Mouse, Aunt Sister, Fred, Woofer, Bubba on his heating pad ... what a delight this series has been!  And this last installment was a joy, too.  The mystery itself was okay.  To be absolutely fair and honest, we weren't given that many real clues as to the villain's identity -- and usually I consider that something of a cheat.  Still, I never read these mysteries simply to see how the crime is solved.  I enjoyed these books -- and this one -- for the imagination and care that went into developing the setting, the characters and the dialog.  Who but Ms. George could have combined a line of high-kicking Elvises and the missed-but-not-forgotten bare-butted Vulcan statue into the same stew?  I was moved as I read the very last pages, for they seemed to be more final and included more closure than her previous efforts.  She tied up the loose ends in both Sister's and Mouse's lives.  I wonder if she knew this book would be her last.  I join the other reviewers on this board who have said how much they will miss this series.	2002-01-24

Frank McCourt was able to do this exceptionally well in ANGELA'S ASHES (and the film makers weren't able to do it at all). The world does look different when viewed through the eyes of a child, indeed because that child has no other frame of reference.  And Zippy's observations made this book funny and touching.  I loved the way she viewed her older sister, especially in the beauty contest chapter.  I also thought wistfully of days gone by, and how much more freedom Zippy (and I) had in youth.  Today, in this much more violent world, I wonder if children can simply wander safely through even the smallest towns, looking for adventure the way Zippy did.  And that cover photo!

This story is indeed about three Americans, how their experiences shaped them, and their complete and utter inability to understand one another.  Two of the characters, Behrani and Kathy, are so well drawn that at some times I found myself rooting for him or her, at other times disliking him or her intensely.  The story is a genuine tragedy, and while it sounds incredible in synopsis, it's easy to believe as the story unfolds.  While I don't agree with the customer reviewer who said the sex was gratuitous, I have to admit I didn't like it.  It made Lester's relationship with Kathy too superficial, too easy to explain.  This sad, remarkably unremarkable girl was the first time he'd given in to temptation?  I don't buy it.  But the Kathy/Lester dynamic is the only complaint I have with a terrific book.	2001-12-26

The plot is involving, the action is exciting, and best of all, the backstory is important, intriguing and holds it all together. Paul Giacommin is back, as is his mother, and their relationship leads Spenser to explain a bit of his own family dynamic to Susan (and us). I include his relationship with Hawk in that, as he has become family to Spenser. Speaking of families, the Broz crime family turns out to be a family in more ways than one. And, best of all, this is the book where we meet the beloved Pearl. As an animal lover, I did cringe every time Spenser brought Pearl along on his adventures. If there's any opportunity that fighting might break out, I think the precious &quot;Baby&quot; is better off left at home.	2001-12-10

Fair enough, but where's the evidence?  It's all speculation, and it may not be true. The book is well written and highly sympathetic to a woman I agree was gallant throughout her life, but it also strays wildly from other published Kennedy accounts without much substantiation. The Mary Meyer in this book bears NO resemblence to the one in the excellent Burleigh biography. Janet Auchincloss is treated much better in both Spoto's recent book on JBKO and the new JANET AND JACKIE book available on amazon. Rose Kennedy seems very different in the Laurence Leamer book on all the Kennedy women than she does here. And JFK himself?  Are we to believe that he was a paper tiger, a playboy  who would have been nothing without the brilliant behind-the-scenes machinations of his wife?  And let's not forget that this wife -- who was referred to as a Dresden doll when she was named deb of the year by Cholly Knickerbocker and graced movie magazine covers from the moment she hit the national scene --  was supposedly crippled with doubts about her own appearance. The author says the couple was sexually incompatible; yet Jackie was pregnant five times in ten years. Also, if the President were merely looking for a partner he was compatible with, he could have easily settled on one mistress -- not the parade described here.  Clearly his sexual escapades had more to do with his own psychology than with his relationship with his wife.  I enjoyed the author's Hepburn bio very much and approached this book with great expectations. Alas, they were not met.	2001-11-29

Spenser is flip and condescending as he deals with women in search of themselves in the long-ago days of Phil Donahue, Alan Alda and Patty Hearst.  At times, he is so smug (Susan's word, by the way) that I was sorry I picked up the book.  For diehard fans of the series, this edition is noteworthy for the introduction of Hawk.

This book shines the light on Janet, which is a welcome change. While I applaud the new approach, I'm afraid it's not entirely successful. It includes many Janet stories, and almost as much about Jackie, but disappointingly little about Janet AND Jackie.  I also wish that Lee and her relationship with Janet and Jackie had been explored more. Still, this book is an entertaining and credible read. I especially appreciated the part where Janet confronts her Senatorial son-in-law regarding his behavior after Jackie loses a baby. Mrs. Auchincloss behaved just as my, or other good mother, would.	2001-10-17

I also hold Hawk in high esteem.  And Pearl never fails to charm me.  I always consider time spent with these characters time well spent.  I enjoyed the twists this plot took me on and appreciated that Spenser and Parker both respected the Asian/American community depicted here.  HOWEVER, most of the female characters in this book were more than a little hard to like.  Susan seems almost oblivious to the danger she perpetually puts her lover in.  And, while I don't want to give too much of the plot away, let's just say that a lot of the story hinges on the selfish, shallow motives of women, as well.  The misogyny of this work almost gave me the creeps.  Of the new characters, DeSpain is the most intriguing.	2001-09-25

So this is the first time any of us met Spenser! This is an early, pre-Susan Spenser who exhibits less conscience when dealing with the ladies but who is still an incorrigible wise-acre and a smart, independent, fearless PI. I missed Hawk, Pearl and even Susan, but still enjoyed this book for the window it gave us into Spenser's early development. BTW, his first name is Jim.

It's a staggering chronicle of loss, beginning with the death of Mary's mother when she was a girl, through the deaths of her sons, the murder of her husband, the loss of her place in society, and the virtual loss of her oldest son and her only grandchild. The toll these tragedies took on Mary was mighty, but understandable. And Dr. Baker makes this sad saga imminently readable.

I borrowed the title of my review from the ending of the book because I found it so frustrating!  I admit it, I'm not as smart as Kinsey.  And her statement about looking at suspects and suddenly realizing what she'd been looking at all along was just too cryptic for me.  Yes, I figured out who did it.  But Kinsey seemed to have realized at that critical moment WHY the deed was done, and I wish she'd explained that insight.<br />Still, I enjoyed this &quot;letter,&quot; as I've enjoyed every entry in the series. I didn't feel much sympathy for Fiona, but I liked that Kinsey was forced (by economic realities) to continue working for someone she didn't especially care for.  It made her seem more an Everywoman.  I didn't find the details about medical billing too hard to follow (and, as I established above, I'm not the brightest Kinsey fan), so don't let that scare you off.  I was intrigued by the scare-your-socks-off subplot about her new office.  And I thought her on-going relationship with Jonah Robb was realistically portrayed.<br />But that ending!

Is she an equal, challanging partner, worthy of our hero? Or is she an inflated, whining bore? I've always fallen squarely into both camps. I think she's smart, beautiful, self-indulgent and self-involved. It's always bothered me that Spenser, so acute in his observations about others, seems blind to Susan's more annoying traits. Until now. She asks him to help her ex-husband out of a bind and then acts like a complete and total witch while he does it. And Spenser actually acknowleges it! Of course he accepts it, and the obstacles of the case, with the patience of Job. But that's what makes him Spenser. <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this installment, more than the more recent POTSHOT. And I had none of the issues that other reviewers mentioned about William Windom's rendition. He's not as good a Spenser as Joe Mantagna, but I liked him better than Burt Reynolds. I do wish the technicians had mixed the tape a little better, though. The sound was frequently just too soft. (Or perhaps, like Spenser, I'm showing my age!)	2001-06-25

And, in an ending that genuinely surprised me, still very much a romantic.  So in all, there's nothing in this book that tells us anything about Spense that those familiar with the series don't already know. And I agree with the reviewers who have noted that while Pearl is aging, Susan and Hawk and most of all Spenser are still in their primes.  It's an annoying distraction.  When we hear Spenser mention Korea, it forces us to do the math and realize that all this derring do is being done by a man of (at least) 65. Parker should borrow from the Kinsey Milhone series and set his protagonist in a very definite time and keep him there. STILL, I enjoyed the book.  Time spent with Spenser is alway time well spent.  This just isn't one of the best.	2001-06-20

And I knew that she died in precisely the way she feared. But I wasn't really a fan. Therefore, when I found myself feeling heartbroken for this poor woman at least once-a-chapter, I was surprised. Her life may have looked glamorous from the outside, yet it must have felt like hell from the inside. And yet to the very end, she kept trying to make it all better, to get to that happy ending. What a brave, gallant woman. A happy family and a satisfying career -- aren't the things Natalie found so illusive the same things most women want?

In the version I read, Mary Ann's parents were pro-life, anti-capital punishment and had been vehemently against the Viet Nam War.  In the America I live in, two of these three views would have them leaning to the left of the political center and certainly not the right wing zealots others on this page have implied ... nor as easy to categorize. Same with Caroline Masters, a judge and woman who in her heart believes that abortion is wrong but agonizes about whether her religious beliefs have any place in law. Women's bodies and the lives of the unborn are political pawns in this country. It's a fact. And this book goes to great pains to humanize this -- taking it out of the realm of the hypothetical and making it a reality in one girl's life. It also highlights how mean spirited the political game has become, and how impossible it is today for well meaning, intelligent people to disagree without name calling, stereotyping and mudslinging. This is an important book and a thrilling entertainment.  A must read for everyone who is interested in hearing BOTH SIDES of the argument (not just theirs).  My only complaint -- the opening is just too impossible to believe!  A judge dying on national TV as he administers the oath of office to the new president?  Hokey!

Yes, I believe that there are girls like this.  Girls who are so afraid of growing up, who find the real world so drab or unacceptable, that they virtually disappear into the cotton candy dream world presented to them by the editors of teen  magazines. These girls didn't think about  boyfriends or careers. They didn't even seem to interact with very often with others who didn't share their obsession.  To them, the future was nothing more than the next BCR gig.  (Or even more pathetic, the next BCR/Krofft puppet show!) The book has funny moments, sweet moments and is infused with the ring of truth.  The author deserves credit for writing about herself in such an unflinching way. But ultimately I found it heartbreakingly sad.  I wish it had offered real insights into why these girls turned their back on reality, why no one was able to reach them (not even a shrink!), and whether or not anyone really tried. Thank God these girls managed to grow into productive, reasonably happy adults in spite of all this.	2001-05-21

This book is insightful, touching and filled with important, useful information for anyone who has a family member struggling with cancer (or any other catastrophic disease). I found the story about his hospital encounter with Roy Cohn to be fascinating, human and honest. There were things I found curious, though.  Mr. Jordan tells much about his political career, with stories about his rise and fall interwoven throughout the cancer narrative. As one who is familiar with his career, I was as surprised by what he included as by what he left out. (Ross Perot and Ed Rollins, for example.)	2001-05-14

The pix are great, and though I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that there isn't much variety here, they do give the viewer the a real sense of being in the front row of the concert. That's something the author should be very proud of. But the text!  Geez!  Story after story about looking for Paul, finding Paul, how Paul changed his or her life ... After a while, you're tempted to take the entire endeavor less seriously because the stories are so silly.  That's a shame, because the pix are very good.	2001-05-11

I mean, &quot;The List&quot; itself wasn't unique or insightful enough to garner all the attention it received. But once I got over that hurdle, I had a great time with this story. The dialog was delightful, the suspense really built and the romance was provocative. If you're a fan of the thriller genre, you'll enjoy this one.	2000-12-20

For that I was grateful. This is another dark chapt. in Kay's life. Unlike many other reviewers, I enjoyed the introspection. I believe that it foreshadows great changes in Kay's life. If you care about this character, you'll care about this story. If you're a mystery/thriller purist, you may find it wanting. The end comes so quickly!  (Too quickly.)	2000-12-20

However, it's not one of the series' best. I figured out the mystery long before the end, perhaps even before Spenser, and knowing who dunnit so early on took some of the fun out of it.  And I missed Hawk. But most of all, I had a hard time with the Clive family. The sisters had such sad, empty lives, and the story took them nowhere towards a happy ending.	2000-12-20

This book offers up both a compelling mystery story and a fascinating bit of social commentary.  The gang members that Spenser is battling are (to paraphrase him) both cold blooded killers and at the same  time sad, damaged children that deserve compassion. The fact that this is  the route Hawk might have taken adds even greater depth. I also, once  again, enjoyed Spenser's relationship with Susan. She is a smart,  complicated woman in love with a smart, complicated man (although I wish  she wouldn't let Pearl eat off her fork or chop stick).	2000-06-26

I especially enjoyed the photos that show Jackie appearing less guarded than usual (the one of the First Lady skeptically  being hugged by a Prime Minister is terrific).  As the book goes on and  Jackie matures, there are fewer and fewer of these unguarded pix ... once  she became Jackie O, it seems the famous smile was frozen in place.  Still,  I enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who remembers her fondly.	2000-05-12

I found it affectionate, but balanced and credible (the anecdote about how Paul and Linda &quot;paid&quot; New York cabbies was rather revealing).  The quotes from  Pete Townsend added a lot, too.  I had no idea he was so close to the Macs,  and his insights were always a delight.  Linda comes off as a flesh and  blood woman who made a conscious decision to make a difficult relationship  work -- and viewed in those terms, her life was a success.  I wish more  attention had been paid to Linda's relationships with Mary, Stella and  James (only Heather is mentioned often).  But this is a small quibble with  an otherwise moving love story.	2000-05-04

I enjoyed this book and applaud the author for discovering a fresh approach to a much (MUCH) studied topic.  Reading it was breezy fun.  But a lot of this book is picked up from other books. The author himself is very  honest about this in the attributions listed in the back. Since so much  that's been printed about this controversial family is in dispute, I think  the reader should be wary about taking every word as gospel.  Still, the  author clearly admires his subjects and the style in which he brought them  all together was terrific.	2000-03-30

Spenser is a delight -- as are Hawk, Susan and especially Pearl.  I like a mystery where the characters have more on their minds than  just the plot.  Spenser's relationship with &quot;the gray man,&quot;  Susan's desire for children, issues of police corruption and racism all  made the story richer for me.  The only thing I didn't like was Burt  Reynolds' performance.  He sounded too old for part.  Worse, at times his  delivery made it sound like he was reading the book for the first time.   Perhaps next time around I'll READ Spenser.	2000-03-10

This book does a wonderful job explaining the legal dealings -- and how they were stacked against her. But Betty was also emotionally immature (even dangerous) and entirely too  willing to let her children be weapons on the marital battlefield. And  while Dan Broderick was certainly no saint, to say that he abused Betty and  drove her to her actions is an insult to the women all over the country who  have to fight off the fists of husbands at night, or who have to drag the  fathers of their children into court to get child support, and yet somehow  manage to NOT resort to homicide.<br />For the most part, this book is very  fair and even-handed.  And fascinating about the gender roles that we fall  into in our  relationships. If Betty hadn't seen her value only in terms of  Dan, if she had viewed Gloria Steinem as more than &quot;pretty but  weird,&quot; if Dan hadn't been so sure of his divine right to call the  shots, this tragedy would not have happened.<br />I came away from the book  feeling that the author gave Linda Kolkena a raw deal.  Whatever her sins  may have been (and from where I sit, her sin was falling in love with and  blindly believing in her &quot;knight in shining armor&quot;), she paid for  them with her life.	2000-03-01

I've read every available letter of the Milhone/alphabet series.  I've been chilled and thrilled by  Scarpetta and Lucy.  I'm a fan of VI Warshawsky's and Amanda  Pepper's.  But NONE of those series is as consistently delightful as these  mysteries crafted by Ms. George!  She has a special sense of her  characters, their place and their time.  The dialog is unique, fresh and  funny.  The plots -- while not too violent or hair-raising -- are designed  to keep us guessing.  And the characters feel like old friends.  I have a  few quibbles with this book (more about what happened to some of the  characters after it ended would have been appreciated).  But by and large,  this was one of the most pleasant light reads I've enjoyed in a long time.   (And I enjoy the artwork on the cover of her paperbacks, too.)	2000-02-16

McCourt is a writer of uncommon wit, sensitivity and honesty.  (I wonder how many of us have such a clear-eyed understanding of our own  faults and weaknesses?)  I especially loved the passages about school and  the teachers' lounge, as  I tend to forget how hard teachers work and  appreciate the reminder.  And I appreciated Frank's own performance of his  work.  Malachy isn't the only ham in this family!	2000-02-09

So much so that is strained credibility.  While the writer's approach is refreshing when compared to the hatchet jobs that have appeared  over the years (one ludricous book even accuses Jackie of being an  accomplice to JFK's murder!), it lacks the objectivity that a good  biographer would bring to his subject.  Still, I enjoyed the time I spent  reading about this gallant lady.	2000-02-08

The fantasy games and The Weasel were certainly innovative, but the impact that this traumatic case might have on the lives of his family (don't worry, I  won't spoil it by saying more) are touched on in such a superficial way  it's almost offensive. Alex Cross loves his kids, fiancee and old nana,  right?  I would have appreciated it if he spent more time on them during  his narrative.  He seems almost as uninterested in the effects this case  may have on his family as the Weasel is about his ex-pat clan, and the  Weasel is a sociopath!  Show us a little more humanity, and we'll carry  Alex Cross around with us a little longer after the book is done.	2000-01-04

A private woman and a nice Catholic girl, she was mercilessly dragged through scandal after her death.  Ms. Rule makes Annie  three-dimensional, which is as it should be.  Too often in these books,  it's the murderer who is the most memorable character.  I also enjoyed the  passages about the police work.  The cops and detectives are real-life  heroes.  I'm only sorry that Capano's and McIntyre's kids have to live  through these revelations.	1999-12-24

And we're the better for it. He was more sophisticated and world-weary than  I'd expected, but that in no way detracted from my enjoyment of the book.  It's a portrait of an artist who has been around for more than 50 years,  famous for more than 30, and who managed to both leave an indeliable mark  on his century and have a fulfilling home life.  If some things are  factually inaccurate, well, this is how Macca remembers them.  The book is  very honest about that.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the  Beatles, pop music or pop culture.	1999-12-04

Diana was a beautiful woman plagued by problems no one around her was enlightened enough to understand or address.  And the reviewers here who deny those  problems and continue to deify Diana perpetuate that &quot;dark ages&quot;  view of mental illness.  For heaven's sake, the lady herself admitted to  eating disorders, infidelity and self mutilation during her famous PANORAMA  interview and Andrew Morton's book!  Pretending that these problems were  manufactured by Prince Charles doesn't help shed any light on them.  Diana  was a complex, fallible, charismatic woman and should be remembered as Ms.  Smith presents her -- not as a goddess but as a woman.  I believe it was  her very humaness as well as her humanity that helped her captivate the  world.	1999-09-22

Kay and sister Dorothy ... Pete's mid-life career trouble ... a thief loose in the coroner's office ... internet fraud ... Kay learning to love again ... any ONE of  these would have been a good subplot for the main mystery.  ALL of them was  simply too much.  I enjoy learning about Kay and I think it was important  we saw her greive.  And I loved the bit with Talley.  But I wish Ms.  Cornwell would have edited this down somewhat.  All this drama happening  concurrently is just a bit much to take ... and too much to believe. (Does  *every* Scarpetta book have to have Lucy in trouble/peril?

I enjoyed the way that Jo evolved, how her relationship with her mother changes, how watching her daughter's freedom on stage stirred the yearnings of her own youth, how evocatively the 1960s  are portrayed and how romantically that decade is remembered.  Those  judgemental sorts who condemn this book and this main character would do  well to reread the passages of the book devoted to the newspaper coverage  of the events in the house.  How tawdry the cavalier reporters made life  inside the commune seem, and how much pain their insensitive arrogance  caused.  We're all human, we all have the capacity to change, and all of  our relationships are very fragile.  That's what I got out of this  beautiful book.

It is by no means definitive, nor does it pretend to be.  It's the memories of a friend -- someone who actually knew who knew  the POW, but knew her in a very narrow, particular way.
