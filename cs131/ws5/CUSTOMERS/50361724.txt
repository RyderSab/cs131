A jam packed expose' on what lies down the road as the hate driven mullahs gain the power to try and fulfill thier sworn promise, to wipe Israel from the face of the earth. Timmerman documents and lays the groundwork for what cannot be denied, Iran must be stopped. Don't miss this revealing and much needed red flag for what is surely to be a situation the US must not allow and one Israel WILL not allow. One thing I disagree with Timmerman on is the \\"fix\\" , that the US should stronly encourage and finance the democratic population in Iran in hopes that democracy will prevail and the mullahs will be overthrown, there is no time for that now and the newly elected president is a terrorist himself..this support should have been done 10 years ago, it's too late now.	2005-08-14

As of late I decided to read some books on the subject and this book was given to me for Christmas. This is a wonderful book in that it gives the reader a complete, precise fact filled overview of the war. It is easy to read and move through ( I finished it in 2 days) and lays the groundwork for the reader to move on to a deeper study of the subject with this as the foundation. Highly recommend!	2005-01-02

This book caught my eye because it somwhat delves into the Chasidic communities of L.A and New York. The book was a fast moving,light read. I did find myself compelled to read on to find out who killed the young Chasidic babysitter. My only complaint is I agree some other reviewers, most of it was unbelievable ( all the characters were SO willing to help our sleuth out, all detectives should be so lucky) and the ending left me thinking it even more unrealistic. But I guess sometimes unrealistic things can happen in real life too. Too much of it just feel into place too easily, it got rather hokey. But all in all I would have to say its worth my rating.	2003-07-31

The book is well written and explores her personal issues to her political issues, and gives the reader a dim insight to what really makes Hilary tick. Since she was in the spot light for 8 years as First Lady and subsequently as Senator Clinton this is a goold glimpse into a figure that surely make the history books.

This book written soon after WWII, brings the fresh suffering and horror of what it was like in the Polish Jewish ghettos. Though a vast, incomprehensible tradegy ,the strength of the human spirit does prevail in our writer. He lost everything and yet his will to live drove him to hang on in the face of an impossible existence. It also gives you a look at the german officer who spared his life towards the end of the war. In all the horror there were spots of light, people who were good in a drowning pool of evil. I could not put this book down and it is one of the very best books I have read in a long time. You owe it to yourself as part of the human race to read it.	2003-05-26

Gracelin O'Malley flees Ireland escaping starvation and the law ,and leaves behind her baby son and Father. Having read the first of this 2 part tale (so far, its obvious # 3 will be coming) of Gracelin O'Malley I find I rated Ann Moore's first effort a little higher. Although Leaving Ireland is a good book and I would surely recommend it,I found it predictable, especially towards the end. It was wrapped up in the last 3 chapters with an amateurs touch and for me that took away from the whole story.	2003-05-24

I had thoroughly enjoyed the book that preceded this, Sister of My Heart and looked so forward to finding out what happened to the sisters. But it was a major annoyance to have 10 \\"descriptive\\" words in each sentence and for me that distracted from the story and after a few chapters I simply found it too distracting to continue. Sister of My Heart was descriptive and poetic in much of the writing but I think our author here tried too hard to duplicate that achievment and overdid it! Shame..it detracted from an otherwise good story.	2002-12-28

Easy to read,thought provoking and good character development. The Marchewka women are inseparable. They value the gathering of family and cooking traditional Polish foods. But as the story grows we find the newer generations culturally removed from thier mothers and grandmothers as Polish immigrants. A close look into family life in general, although this family is Polish by immigration the struggles and heartbreaks are really about &quot;every&quot; family. Highly recommend !!	2002-12-21

Chocked full of all that we secretley love peeking into, the life of movie stars,drug dependency,sex and struggling to make it in a mean world and a mean business. Our three main characters Neely,Jennifer and Ann are all self destructive drama queens in their own distinctive way. It offers a panorama view of how shallow life can be if you put your priorities in the wrong things and the grief chasing after these can bring. It really is classic commentary .	2002-12-01

Set in the 1960's south we read of struggles with racism and a perserverance of individual courage. Also we learn about forgiveness and friendship. The book was well written and fast moving. The only thing that turned me off was the whole New Age \\"goddess within\\" theme, but thats just my personal taste (or distaste). All in all, an excellent book, made me feel like going and having a spoon full of honey! Pick up a copy and join the BUZZ!	2002-11-17

Having read several of her others books (Open House,Durable Goods...) I find her ability to take a simple story and make it a compelling study about everyday people who have problems unlike our own. In this book she examines through the eyes of two sisters the effect thier mother leaving has on them, and on the mother's side how she sets aside her children to &quot;find&quot; herself, in so doing she &quot;loses&quot; them. The only reason I did not rate this a 5 star is I feel it was wrapped up a little too quickly in the end.  I think for the scope of pain these gals had experienced at thier mothers abandonment they would not have ended up laughing on the floor together so quickly.	2002-09-02
