Plato, however, I have read, and therefore will address volume 1, &quot;The Spell of Plato&quot;.<br />This is a fascinating book. In a review of another book on Plato, I wrote that one important test of any work of secondary literature is whether the time spent reading it would be better spent re-reading the primary literature instead. Popper's book easily passes that test. I would by no means recommend reading it as a substitute for reading Plato ???- it contains too many interpretations that I think seriously wrong, and its narrow focus on political philosophy leaves many aspects of Plato's philosophy untouched, but as a text that helps the reader read Plato critically it is excellent, provided only that the reader doesn't forget to read Popper critically as well.<br />The principal focus of the book is of course Plato's political philosophy. Popper reads it as part of an Athenian debate between democrats and anti-democratic reactionaries, and that Plato writes on behalf of the reactionaries. Popper presents Plato as a man who began under the tutelage of Socrates, whose positive influence is responsible for the best aspects of Plato's thought, but that Plato over time became increasingly corrupted. Popper summarizes his view in a really fine piece of writing that I cannot resist quoting:<br />&quot;Socrates had refused to compromise his personal integrity. Plato, with all his uncompromising canvas-cleaning, was led along a path on which he compromised his integrity with every step he took. He was forced to combat free thought and the pursuit of truth. He was led to defend lying, political miracles, tabooistic superstition, the suppression of truth, and ultimately, brutal violence. In spite of Socrates' warning against misanthropy and misology, he was led to distrust man and to fear argument. In spite of his own hatred of tyranny, he was led to look to a tyrant for help, and todefend the most tyrannical measures. ??? he succeeded in blinding himself, by his own spell, to powers which once he had hated.&quot;<br />As a general rule, I judge an interpretation of Plato by its ability to explain difficult passages and in particular passages that appear to be contradictory. I think that Popper's main thesis, as quoted above, is a very strong interpretation. Many passages that other interpretations struggle with (such as the numerous passages in which seeking the truth is praised vs. the famous passage in Republic in which lying is conditionally endorsed) can be explained by Popper's theory that Plato's thought corrupted over time.<br />Although Popper's book is absolutely one I recommend, I mentioned that I thought that some of Popper's interpretations were simply wrong and believe that elaboration on a comment like that must be made. One of these is Popper's thesis that Plato was a historicist. Popper's historicist classification of Plato depends on Popper's reading that Plato held that all historical social change to be corruption. I think that this reading creates numerous interpretive difficulties and is therefore very likely false. The primary support Popper cites for this view is the developmentally ordered series of states in Republic VIII. A difficult text for this theory is Statesman 302b-303b: in that text, Plato ranks democracy as superior to oligarchy, and so (according to Popper's theory) oligarchy out to be developmentally later than democracy, yet in Republic VIII it is democracy that is later than oligarchy. Another difficult passage is Laws 694b to 696a, in which Plato describes Persia not undergoing a continuous decline but as going from good (under Cyrus) to bad (under Cyrus's children) to good again (under Darius) and back to bad (under Xerxes). Still another difficult passage would be the brief text in Laws 676a-c, in which Plato proposes an examination into how, over time, states have made moral progress or declined, andhow superior states have deteriorated and bad ones improved (the example of Persia mentioned earlier is brought up in this context) with no hint that he viewed the idea of progress or improvement as a problem for his philosophy. On this topic I would conclude with the general observation that unlike Hegel and Marx, both of whom wrote book-length world histories, Plato seldom referred to historical events, and his longest historical text (Laws III from which two of my examples are taken) is unproblematic if read without reference to Popper's theory but becomes a confusing series of puzzles if read with reference to Popper's theory.<br />In closing, I would like to quote (in a slightly abbreviated form) from Jonathan Barnes' introduction to &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle&quot;: &quot;Suppose you read a chapter in which it is suggested that Aristotle believed such-and-such. If you turn over the page and say to yourself, 'Oh, Aristotle believed such-and-such', then the book will have failed. For you are meant, as you put the book down, to converse with yourself in the following sort of way: &quot;Oh, so Aristotle is supposed to have believed such-and-such. What an interesting - or perplexing, or perverse - thing to have thought. Might it be true? Come to that, did Aristotle really mean exactly that? Let me look now at Aristotle's own words and see what he actually says.&quot; I do not know if Popper intended such a response from his book on Plato, but I think it an admirable goal for any work in philosophy's secondary literature and it is certainly the response Popper got from me.<br />Highly recommended, faults and all.	2004-07-05
US	52674203	R1N6B24ZY342Y1	0898709482	662391463	J.R.R. Tolkien: Myth, Morality, and Religion	Books	4	36	38	N	N	Reading Tolkien, Right and Wrong	This is a new edition of a book published in 1984 that has long been out of print. So far as I can tell, the only change is a new preface of Joseph Pierce. The republication is due in part to the surge of interest in Middle Earth occasioned by the new movies, and in part due to the interest the publisher, Ignatius Press, has in the book's subject matter.<br />What Tolkien, Purtill, and Ignatius Press all have in common is their Roman Catholicism, and of particular relevance to this book, a common sense of morality stemming from it. Between the Purtill the critic and Tolkien the author are additional commonalities as well: Purtill, like Tolkien, is an academic who is also an author of fantasy.<br />Given the commonalities between Purtill and Tolkien, it is therefore not surprising that  the critic is entirely sympathetic to the author. In explaining, Purtill also defends. There are a few passages where Purtill makes the defense explicit, citing negative comments by others and then arguing against them. For the most part, however, the defense is implicit, inherent in the explanations he gives. The explicit defenses are not fully satisfactory. In terms of tone they come off as, for lack of a better word, defensive. A deeper problem however is that the explicit defenses by their very nature tend to distort that which they defend - points minor in Tolkien can become major in a defense of Tolkien. These defects make Purtill's explicit defenses sufficiently unsatisfactory that the work would have been improved through their omission.<br />Where Purtill succeeds and succeeds quite well is when he defends Tolkien implicitly. The strength of his book lies in his explanations of Tolkien's moral views, as well as how myth is used as a means to convey them. When Purtill works directly with Tolkien's published writings and with comments he made about them in his letters, Purtill is at his most interesting and his book most worth the time spent with it.<br />The main works of Tolkien taken up by Purtill are \\"Leaf by Niggle\\", \\"On Fairy Stories\\", \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\". The attention paid by Purtill to the first of these, \\"Leaf by Niggle\\" will surprise some readers, but it is I think justified by the parallels between the character Niggle and Tolkien; to understand how Tolkien saw Niggle is to a considerable extent to understand how Tolkien saw himself. \\"On Fairy Stories\\" is similarly self-referential in that Tolkien is writing about a genre in which he himself works. If \\"Leaf by Niggle\\" is about the relationship between Tolkien and his writing, \\"On Fairy Stories\\" is about the relationship between Tolkien's writing and the world. Together, these works give the reader a sense of how Tolkien saw his writing and it is through these works that Purtill approaches the others.<br />Tolkien's chief works, \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\" share a common world, and are treated by Purtill in an overlapping fashion. Purtill's main goal is to separate and discuss the works' moral themes. In his discussion of how morality is presented in the three works, Purtill applies the approach developed in his discussion of the previous two: the use of a particular world and a particular story to illuminate the universal and unchanging. What is the nature of good? What is the nature of evil? How do good and evil operate in man? It is simply by explaining what Tolkien has to say about these themes that Purtill's literary defense of Tolkien succeeds; it is when he is least concerned with defending him and most concerned with simply explaining him that Purtill defends Tolkien best.<br />Tolkien employs multiple methods to make his moral points. First, he often simply makes the moral physical - beauty and ugliness representing good and evil. Second, he facets personality; this character receives this facet while another character receives another. Third, he makes moral choices stark. While it is many other things as well, morally Tolkien's work is one of analysis - he breaks up complexity into simpler parts for study. Given this, an analytical reader is doomed to failure because his work has already been done for him - he can't break up Tolkien's characters into simpler parts because they are simple parts already. Morality in Tolkien becomes interesting not when he is read analytically, but when he is read synthetically - when the reader considers not the parts in themselves but in how the parts relate to each other.<br />Purtill's book benefits its reader in two ways. First, in his explanation of particular moral points that Tolkien makes that many readers may not have caught, but which enrich the experience once understood. Second, and more importantly, Purtill explains how to read Tolkien - Purtill has by no means exhausted the moral complexities of Tolkien's work; he opens the door but ultimately leaves each reader with the pleasure of crossing through and exploring it for himself.hings as well, morally Tolkien's work is one of analysis - he breaks up complexity into simpler parts for study.

I always like to start any review of a technical book with the table of contents, and see no reason to break with that practice here:<br />I Preliminaries <br />Introduction - Basic C++ Syntax and Semantics - Understanding the Management Perspective- The Architectural Perspective<br />II Object-Oriented Design<br />Object-Oriented Fundamentals - Specification of Observable Behavior - Proper Inheritance - Detecting and Correcting Improper Inheritance - Error Handling Strategies - Testing Strategies<br />III Language Facilities<br />References ('&' type) - New and Delete - Inline Functions - Const Correctness - Namespaces - Using Static - Derived Classes - Access Control - Friend Classes and Friend Functions - Constructors and Destructors -Virtual Functions - Initialization Lists - Operator Overloading - Assignment Operators - Templates - Exception Tactics - Types and RTTI - Containers<br />IV Topics<br />Mixing and Overloading with Inheritance - The Big Three (destructors, copy constructors, assignment operators) - Using Objects to Prevent Memory Leaks - Wild Pointers and Other Devilish Errors - High-Performance Software - COM and Active X - Transitioning to CORBA - C Language Considerations - Private and Protected Inheritance - Pointers to Member Functions - The Transition to OO and C++<br />-<br />I don't think there are any great C++ books. A great book would eliminate the need for others, which none that I've seen do. Even if not great, this is a good book, and worth reviewing. The book attempts to be two things: first, a programming style guide, and second, a nuts-and-bolts C++ reference book. (Incidentally, the cover is somewhat misleading: it also trumpets coverage of ActiveX, CORBA, and COM, but the material on them here is very thin - if you need to understand them, look elsewhere).<br />As a programming style guide, it is rather a mixed bag. Its main weakness is a tendency towards salesmanship - that is, the authors are trying to sell you something and aretherefore quite aggressive in discussing the merits of their wares and tend to be silent when discussing the weaknesses of them. A particular problem I could point out is the use of C++ in DLLs. If you follow the style guide in this book, and try to put your code into DLL's, you will find that you have some very serious versioning problems, problems the advice in this book was instrumental in creating but useless in alleviating. This doesn't mean that the advice isn't generally good, but there are issues here that the authors are not as frank as they should be in discussing. (I don't know why propaganda of this sort is so common in C++ books, but it is. I've never seen one without it.)<br />Whatever it may be as a style guide, as a nuts and bolts problem solving book this is really very good. C++ is a large language - it is by far the largest, most complex language ever to find wide use, and there it contains many pitfalls. This book's great strength is in identifying many of these problem areas, and providing solutions to them. The discussion of object construction, copying, and destruction, alone, for example would make this book worth owning. The coverage is not, however, complete. Reader knowledge of language basics is assumed, and some advanced topics, such as multiple inheritance, are not covered. Because of this, you will not find this a good book for learning C++, nor should it be the only C++ book you own.<br />That said, of all the C++ books I own, this is the one that most often contained the easiest to find, clearest, and best answer to the problems that I actually had when using (as opposed to learning) the language. The answers were generally easiest to find because of the extensive table of contents (it averages about one entry per page) and very complete index. In addition to being easy to find, the answers were also clearly written. There is a lot of sample code in this book, and it is generally very good code for teaching its points. The authors also clearly understand their stuff, and I did not find any of the dreadful this-is-too-technical-for-the-reader hand-waving that so often mars computer industry books. Finally, in addition to being clearly written, the answers were also usually the most complete and thorough I found among the C++ books I own - the problems the book addressed, it addressed very well.<br />In summary, until and unless that great C++ book is ever written - and I'm not holding my breath - this is a book that almost any C++ developer would do well to have, limits and all.	2003-02-05
US	52674203	RIXOQR5NMEXXJ	1928832105	461856286	The Aquinas Catechism: A Simple Explanation of the Catholic Faith by the Church's Greatest Theologian	Books	5	69	69	N	N	Thomas at his most approachable	Despite the book's title, strictly speaking, Thomas Aquinas never wrote a catechism. What he did do was give a series of sermons in 1273, which have since come to be known under the following titles:<br />Explanation of the Apostles' Creed<br />Explanation of the Lord's Prayer<br />Explanation of the Hail Mary<br />Explanation of the Ten Commandments<br />The Articles of Faith and the Heresies Against Each<br />These works have been collected together in &quot;The Aquinas Catechism&quot;, but have also been available elsewhere individually and in different combinations (&quot;The Three Greatest Prayers&quot;, for example, includes the first three listed works,  and &quot;God's Greatest Gifts&quot; contains the last two).<br />These works differ from more typical works of Thomas in two important ways:<br />First, Thomas left us with no authoritative written form of them - what we have is a summary of what was said taken by a member of the audience. While that summary was likely quite faithful (the sermons were a major event ; it was recorded by a contemporary that &quot;almost the whole population of Naples went to hear his sermons every day.&quot;), the notes should not be assumed to have been word-for-word accurate. Another factor to be taken into account with regard to accuracy is the fact that the sermons were given in the native Neapolitan dialect, whereas the written form passed down is in Latin - so this book is a double-translation (Neapolitan to Latin to English). Finally, the general medieval scribal practice of adding &quot;clarifications&quot; to texts they were copying further distances us from the original sermons. These factors do not mean that what we have is suspect, but it does mean that close textual analysis can only be done with great caution.<br />Second, the audience for these works was a general lay audience, who would not have been able to understand the specialized philosophical and theological vocabulary that Thomas generally used. As a result, these works were and are in ordinary language - no special training or preparation is required to be able to understand them. Time has not reduced their accessibility - there is nothing here that should intimidate a modern reader (there are some references to &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;form&quot; in the presentation of the sacraments, but readers do not need to understand the full Aristotelian meaning of these terms to understand Thomas's teaching).<br />That said, the works retain perhaps the most prominent characteristic of all of Thomas's writing, a careful and systematic thoroughness expressed through a strong structural presentation. Topics are broken down, then broken down again, and again, as needed, and each sub-sub-topic is carefully examined and clearly explained.<br />While Thomas always wrote clearly, he seldom did so without use of a technical vocabulary which acts as a barrier to many readers. One of the nice things about these works is that Thomas here is much more approachable, but he still is going into some pretty tough subjects. Here, for example, is part of his description of the Incarnation:<br />&quot;In the first place, without doubt, nothing is more like the Word of God than the unvoiced word which is conceived in man's heart. Now, the word conceived in the heart is unknown to all except the one who conceives it; it is first known to others when he gives utterance to it. Thus, the Word of God while yet in the bosom of the Father was known to the Father alone; but when he was clothed with flesh as a word is clothed with the voice, then He was first made manifest and known.&quot;<br />With regard to the subject matter of these works, the subjects of the first four are easily guessed from their titles. For each, Thomas gives a careful, line-by-line reading and commentary. The last work in the collection is different from the others in two ways: first, its subject matter is not easily guessed from the title and it is not a commentary on atext - it is an explanation of the sacraments: what they consist of, and what they are for. Although the title given to this collection, &quot;The Aquinas Catechism&quot;, is in one sense misleading, in another it is not. The range of topics covered and the method of presentation do in fact correspond with what a catechism should be. If one compares it, for example, with the recently published &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, the equivalencies are immediately obvious - there is no major section of that new work that has no corresponding section in &quot;The Aquinas Catechism&quot; collection.<br />Finally, with regard to the supporting material, the editorial presence is mostly visible in how the text was formatted - the hierarchical structure implicit in the works is made explicit through use of numbers, paragraph breaks, and carefully applied highlighting. There is also a brief forward by Ralph MacInerny, a pair of outlines of the works (a brief one in the table of contents, and a detailed one in an appendix), references for all quotations, scriptural and others, and a two page biography of Thomas. There is no index, but one isn't really needed - the work is so well-structured that it is trivially easy to find almost any point of interest.	2003-01-09
US	52674203	R1OJBOGT5D8Q1D	0060652926	338167986	Mere Christianity	Books	5	1299	1365	N	N	The defense of the faith	In his \\"Preface to Paradise Lost\\", Lewis wrote the following:<br />\\"The first qualification for judging any piece of workmanship from a corkscrew to a cathedral is to know *what* it is - what it was intended to do and how it was meant to be used. After that has been discovered the temperance reformer may decide that the corkscrew was made for a bad purpose, and the communist may think the same about the cathedral. But such questions come later. The first thing is to understand the object before you: as long as you think the corkscrew was meant for opening tins or the cathedral for entertaining tourists you can say nothing to purpose about them.\\"<br />This is a splendid piece of writing, but the idea presented is no way an original one - Plato and Aristotle said the same, said it clearly, and said it over two thousand years before Lewis did. If you had been able to confront Lewis with this fact, he might have said \\"Exactly.\\"<br />This brings us to one of the great themes of Lewis's writing, evident nowhere more so than in \\"Mere Christianity\\": the defense of traditional wisdom against prejudice of our age that would reject it for no other reason than that it is traditional. Lewis often encountered those who complained that his ideas were old-fashioned, and his standard reply was that  theirs would soon be as well, so in that they were equal. I admit I couldn't help but smile at the complaint by one Amazon reviewer that Lewis's ideas on sexuality were \\"decades old\\". The complaint is quite mistaken: the ideas are not decades old but thousands of years old.<br />And it is here that we have part of the answer to the problem of understanding the kind of thing \\"Mere Christianity\\" is: it is nothing new. It is in fact very, very old. What Lewis is defending is not his own personal belief system, but the Christianity that is the common heritage of mankind. The threat to it  comes not from hard-core atheists, who receive the barest of notices from Lewis, but the general moderntendency to subject traditional Christianity to the death of a thousand cuts - discarding one ancient doctrine after another, on grounds often no better than mere chronological snobbery - that modern people aren't supposed to believe that kind of thing anymore<br />This is why Lewis, in what has been often described as the most important defense of Christianity in the twentieth century, spends a mere fifteen pages in arguing for the existence of God. The important task is not to defend a vague theism, which is the position Lewis found from experience that his audience already believed, but to rebuild what little of traditional Christianity modernism has left them - some vague belief in \\"a higher power\\", and \\"some purpose to all of this\\" into that concrete set of specific beliefs that are the historical core of Christianity.<br />While the defense of historical Christianity is one part of understanding what \\"Mere Christianity\\" is, the other part is that it is intended to be accessible to anyone. This requires that Lewis be both clear and brief - a combination brutally difficult to achieve, as any writer who has attempted it will attest.<br />Lewis's success in this can be measured in two ways: first, that his work has indeed found a very wide readership - millions of have read it; second, his work is often recommended by those whose knowledge of traditional Christian theology is broad and deep. The size of the readership attests to the accessibility of the work, and the expert recommendations attest to the accuracy of its message.<br />There is one other thing that is important to note about Lewis's success: Lewis could afford to be brief because what he was explaining was not his own theology, but our common intellectual inheritance. The reader who is dissatisfied with the depth of this or that point in \\"Mere Christianity\\" will have no difficulty in finding sources that go into the same thing in much greater detail. Calvin wrote line-by-line commentaries on all of scripture. Thomas Aquinas's \\"Summa Theologica\\" is over  6,000 pages long. The collected works of Augustine fill more than 40 volumes.<br />So, to return to the question with which this review began: what kind of thing is \\"Mere Christianity\\"? The answer is that it is a brief exposition of traditional Christianity for a modern audience. In the sixty years since it was published, the nature of the modernist challenge to Christianity has not substantially changed, nor has a clearer, more accessible response to that challenge yet been written. Some have complained that the work has \\"gaps\\" or that it skims over this or that point, but that is a complaint that fails to understand what kind of thing this is. What they are asking for, whether they know it or not, is a completely different book. Properly evaluated, on the basis of the kind of thing it is, it is trivially easy to give the highest recommendation to \\"Mere Christianity\\": it is on a topic of the greatest possible importance and the presentation is outstanding.	2002-09-12
US	52674203	R1U09AYF87UY8N	0268016844	442531795	4: Summa Contra Gentiles: Book Four: Salvation	Books	5	14	14	N	N	The Trinity, Incarnation, Sacraments, and Resurrection	\\"Salvation\\" is the last book in \\"Summa Contra Gentiles\\", after \\"God\\", \\"Creation\\", and \\"Providence\\".<br />In the introduction to the first book of \\"Summa Contra Gentiles\\", Thomas promised to treat of truths that could be reached by natural reason and those that surpass it. The first part of that promise were dealt with in the first three books, although the third, \\"Providence\\", started to shade into truths of the second type, while, this, the last book, is wholly concerned with the second type of truth.<br />The transition between the two types of truths is easy to perceive from a shift in the premises Thomas used in his arguments: in approaching truths of the first type, he began with our common experience of the world, while in the second, he began with a particular sub-set of that experience, our experience of revelation through scripture. Where Thomas did not change was in his method: his approach was one of reason and argumentation, using an analytic method built on Aristotelian foundations.<br />With regard to subject matter, \\"Salvation\\" is concerned with four mysteries of Christian belief: the Trinity,  the Incarnation, the Sacraments,  and the Resurrection. For each of these, Thomas was not concerned with demonstrating their truth independent of revelation - indeed, he considered such a task to be an impossibility. His purpose was instead two-fold: first, to defend the Catholic doctrine on these matters as philosophically possible, and second, as scripturally correct.<br />The first of these two purposes is easily understood from the purpose of the work as a whole: to provide intellectual support for Christians in Spain against Jewish and Moslem opponents.  It takes little imagination to understand that demonstrating that Christian doctrine was not simply absurd was necessary both in reinforcing wavering Christians and in converting non-Christians.<br />The second of these two purposes is less obvious, but still understandable. Little is gained if the defeat of some anti-Christian argument is accomplished only by inadvertently adopting some other anti-Christian heresy in the process. A Christian defense must be a defense based on generally sound theological principals, and so Thomas provided not only defenses of the reasonableness of Christian belief, but also defenses against heresies that might otherwise be introduced in the process.<br />That said, one thing I could not help but feel missing from \\"Summa Contra Gentiles\\" was a defense of the authority of the New Testament. There is a substantial gap between demonstrating that such acceptance did not lead to unreasonable conclusions and demonstrating that such acceptance is more reasonable than non-acceptance. Nevertheless, this is something that Thomas simply did not attempt to do, even though it is clearly a necessary step in the defense of Christianity against non-Christians. Why Thomas omitted it is something of a puzzle, with the answer perhaps lying in what we don't know (which is a great deal) about the origins of the work.<br />That said, the points Thomas did undertake to demonstrate were handled with his usual surpassing insight and clarity.  While Thomas had many great qualities as a writer, one of his qualities particularly welcome in a work such as this is the ability to clearly summarize and present without prejudice arguments with which he did not agree - Thomas didn't waste time constructing and demolishing straw men.  Some of the subject matter is quite difficult (there's nothing easy about Trinitarian theology, for example), but  that takes nothing away from Thomas's clarity as a writer.<br />As a final note, readers should be prepared on two levels: first, obviously, a familiarity with scripture. Since the premises of this book are drawn from scripture, the more familiar the reader is with scripture, the better. Second, it helps to be familiar with Aristotelian philosophy - particularly his \\"Physics\\". In my review of the first volume of \\"Summa ContraGentiles\\",  I presented a list of the core philosophical terms that Thomas used.Gentiles\\",  I presented a list of the core philosophical terms that Thomas used.	2002-08-28
US	52674203	RKCELT6A86FJL	0268016844	442531795	4: Summa Contra Gentiles: Book Four: Salvation	Books	5	15	17	N	N	Structure of	Thomas Aquinas was an extraordinarily systematic thinker and writer. Because of this, one of the best ways to comprehend \\"Summa Contra Gentiles\\" is through consideration of its structure. At the highest level, it consists of 4 books, with the third book in two parts, on account of its length.<br />The titles of the five volumes are as follows:<br />Summa Contra Gentiles: God<br />Summa Contra Gentiles: Creation<br />Summa Contra Gentiles: Providence, Part I<br />Summa Contra Gentiles: Providence, Part II<br />Summa Contra Gentiles: Salvation<br />Each volume is formally divided into about 100 short chapters.

US	52674203	R1BGXQ9O8X7TF3	0268016860	951338898	3: Summa Contra Gentiles: Book Three: Providence: Part I	Books	5	13	14	N	N	How a man should live his life	First things first. \\"Summa Contra Gentiles: Providence\\" has been published in two volumes: \\"Summa Contra Gentiles: Providence, Part 1\\", and \\"Summa Contra Gentiles: Providence, Part II\\", which must be purchased separately. The two volumes absolutely go together - the first volume has the introduction for both volumes, and the second volume has the index for both volumes.<br />With questions of how to get it out of the way, it remains to be said what \\"Providence\\" is about and why it is worth reading.<br />If you are familiar with Aristotle, the easiest way to describe \\"Providence\\" is that it covered much the same ground as Aristotle's \\"Nicomachean Ethics\\". This is true in the same sense that the first book of \\"Summa Contra Gentiles\\", \\"God\\" covered the same ground as Aristotle's \\"Physics\\" and that the second book, \\"Creation\\", covered the same ground as Aristotle's \\"De Anima\\". That is, it dealt with the same topics, but from a thoroughly Christian perspective.<br />Of course, if you are not familiar with Aristotle, the above description of \\"Providence\\" is not going to be that helpful. In fact, reading that it is about \\"ethics\\" can even be misleading. In ordinary modern usage, \\"ethics\\" is taken as some set of rules regarding how to treat other people, implicitly dealing with balancing your interests against the interests of others. In traditional philosophy, however, \\"ethics\\" is much broader in scope - it covers the entire subject of how a man should live his life. \\"Providence\\" concerned ethics in this much broader, traditional sense.<br />Within the overall framework of \\"Summa Contra Gentiles\\", \\"Providence\\" was the bridge between the first two volumes (\\"God\\" and \\"Creation\\"), which were almost entirely philosophical in character, and the last volume (\\"Salvation\\"), which was almost entirely theological.<br />Thomas began \\"Providence\\" with a general discussion of the nature of \\"end\\", \\"good\\", and \\"evil\\". His immediate problem was to explain how evil could exist within God'screation, but in spite of the book's title, \\"Providence\\" deals with this problem in only general philosophical terms - there is nothing resembling, for example, Augustine's long exposition in his \\"City of God Against the Pagans\\" of God's plan as enacted through specific historical events. Thomas's real purpose was not to attempt to explain or justify God's plan in His creation, but to frame the central topic of the book - the problem of the achievement of human happiness.<br />To this end, Thomas began by considering the things in which people often attempt to find happiness in this life (fame, power, wealth, the pleasures of the body, virtue), and analyzed the inadequacy of those ends, even to the extent that they could be achieved. In contrast, Thomas held up the contemplation of God as an end worthy of human striving, but also held that - through man's own power at least - that it could not be adequately attained. From this, Thomas concluded that it is only through God's grace - that is, as a gift of God - that it could be had and even then not in this life; but only be in a life to come.<br />Having dealt with the end towards which human beings should strive, and having said that man unaided could not reach it, Thomas in the middle section of \\"Providence\\" considered in more detail the respective parts played by God and man in man's life. This discussion largely revolved around the question of human freedom vs. various concepts of fate and predestination. The major concern was a proper delineation between the divine will and human freedom, one that neither assigned so much power to man as to claim for him the ability to do good without God's help, nor so little as to make God responsible for man's sin.<br />The final section of \\"Providence\\" dealt with the question of how this life should be lived. This section drew on the traditions of classical philosophy scarcely at all; it instead drew almost entirely from scripture and Christian theology. Temperance, Courage, Wisdom, and Justice (the pillars of classical ethics) scarcely put in an appearance, but The Law, God's Grace, and Sin were front and center, each receiving an extended discussion.<br />Because covered the same ground, but drew on it so little, it might be tempting to read Thomas's \\"Providence\\" as a rejection of Aristotle's \\"Nicomachean Ethics\\", but this would be an oversimplification. The ethics of Arisotle and classical philosophy were not being rejected per se (Thomas certainly wasn't recommending profilgacy, cowardice, foolishness, and injustice), but instead held as insufficient, both in the end to which they aimed and the means by which they sought to attain that end. Thomas's argument was that while classical ethics were good, Christian ethics were in every way better, indeed that not only better but perfect, in that they aimed at God as the perfect end, and through God had the perfect means for the achievement of that end.	2002-08-25

What is minimally necessary is an understanding of the vocabulary. Thomas used a number of terms that he acquired from Aristotle that had a particular technical meaning, a meaning that is different from the ordinary meaning of those same terms. Without a good grasp of these terms, the reader simply will not be able to follow Thomas's logic.<br />Fortunately, the list of important terms is not very large, nor are the meanings especially obscure. The purpose of this review is to list and define these terms. For examples, I will draw on the familiar story of \\"The Three Little Pigs\\":<br />Matter, material - what a thing is made of. The matter of the three little pigs' houses are straw, sticks, and bricks respectively. Contrast with \\"form\\".<br />Form, formal - how a thing is ordered or arranged. The form of all of the three little pigs' houses is the same: \\"house\\". Contrast with \\"matter\\".<br />Prime matter - the stuff out of which all physical objects are ultimately made. While the third little pig's house has the form of \\"house\\" and the matter of \\"bricks\\", \\"bricks\\" themselves have a form of \\"brick\\" and matter of \\"earth\\" (assuming they are earthen bricks), and \\"earth\\" itself has a form and matter, and so on. Eventually, this process must end with some matter that is not composed of anything more fundamental. This most fundamental matter is given the name \\"prime matter\\".<br />Substance, substantial - Ordinarily, matter and form together make a substance. The third little pig's house is a substance that combines the matter of \\"bricks\\" and the form \\"house\\". The possibility of substances which do not ultimately derive from prime matter is an important question (perhaps the important question) of Summa Contra Gentiles.<br />Sensible - that which is seen, heard, smelt, touched, or tasted. Sometimes this term is used to refer to the sensible qualities themselves (color, sound, etc.) and sometimes to the objects that have those qualities. The little pigs' houses can be seen, so those houses are sensible objects. Contrast with \\"intelligible\\".<br />Intelligible - that which is understood but not sensed. We understand \\"house\\", but we cannot see \\"house\\", although we can see the three little pig's individual houses. Contrast with \\"sensible\\".<br />Accident, accidental - the qualities of a thing that do not determine what it is. The matter of which the three little pigs' houses are made is accidental; whether a house is made of straw, sticks, or bricks, it is still a house. Contrast with \\"essence\\".<br />Essence, essential - the qualities of a thing that make it what it is. That the three little pigs' houses are places for them to live is essential to those houses; if they couldn't live in them, they wouldn't be houses. Contrast with \\"accidental\\".<br />Quiddity - see \\"essence\\".<br />Privation - a lack of a quality that would ordinarily be present. It would be a privation if the first little pig could not see, but it is not a privation that his house cannot see.<br />Act, actual - what a thing is at a particular time. After the first little pig builds his house (but before the wolf blows it down) it is a house in act. Contrast with \\"potency\\".<br />Potency, potential - what a thing could be, but is not. Before the first little pig builds his house, the straw of which it is to be made is a house in potency. Contrast with \\"act\\".<br />Motion - sometimes refers specifically to movement in space, at other times to any change in a thing.<br />Generation - the process of applying form to matter to make a substance. While the first little pig is building his house from straw, the house is in generation. Contrast with \\"corruption\\".<br />Corruption - the process bywhich matter loses its form and ceases to be a substance. While the wolf is blowing down the first little pig's house, the house is in corruption. Contrast with \\"generation\\".<br />Nature, natural - qualities of a thing or changes to a thing that arise from what it is. It was natural for the sticks of the second little pig's house to stay where he put them. Contrast with \\"violent\\".<br />Violent, violence - motion in a thing that is contrary to its nature. When the sticks in the second little pig's house were blown apart, that change was violent. Contrast with \\"nature\\".<br />Eternal, eternity - often used to mean not dependent on time; as distinct from an infinite amount of time. \\"House\\" is eternal but the pig's individual houses were not.<br />Cause - how a thing came to be. The efficient cause of the first little pig's house was his work in building it. While Aristotle defined four causes: material, efficient, formal, and final, Thomas almost always means the efficient cause when he refers to a thing's cause.<br />End - why a thing came to be. The final cause, or end, of the little pigs' houses were to give them shelter.	2002-07-26

Although that volume requires the reader to know a certain number of technical philosophical terms, it does not otherwise require of him a great deal of contextual knowledge to appreciate.<br />This volume, the second volume in the work, &quot;Creation&quot;, is more demanding. When the reader reaches the chapters concerning the intellect, the reader may well feel in reading it that he has come in on the middle of a long and complex argument. The reason that he may feel this way is because that is what he has done.<br />The center of the controversy is Aristotle's analysis of the intellect. His exposition on that point was not successful if we measure success by the ability of intelligent careful readers to come to a shared understanding of what he thought. Thomas's part in these controversies are the heart of this, the second volume of &quot;Summa Contra Gentiles&quot;.<br />While the best thing that the reader could do to prepare himself to read this book would be to be well-read in Aristotle in general (and his &quot;De Anima&quot; in particular), that may not be possible for all readers. Therefore, as an aid to readers, this review will present the key terms in the controversy and what they meant (at least what they meant to Thomas)*:<br />Sensible - objects of sense - things that can be seen, heard, felt, tasted or smelled. Individual houses would be sensible. Contrast with &quot;intelligible&quot;.<br />Intelligible - objects of reason - things that can be understood, but not sensed. The concept of &quot;house&quot; would be intelligible. Contrast with &quot;sensible&quot;.<br />Phantasm - a sensation, whether the immediate result of the sight, hearing, touch, smell or taste of a sensible object, or a recollection of one of those sensations, or an imagined sensation. Contrast with &quot;knowledge&quot;.<br />Knowledge - a correctly understood intelligible object; remembered sensations are not themselves knowledge.

Contrast with &quot;cognitive power&quot;.<br />Soul - when classical philosophers debated what &quot;the soul&quot; was, what they were debating was what differentiated living things from non-living things. While Thomas followed Aristotle in the view that the soul was the form of the body (i.e. - what differentiated living things from non-living was not what they were made of, but how they were put together)<br />Nutritive soul - that most general power of the soul by which life is present in anything: its operations being reproduction and the use of nutriment. All living things have a nutritive soul.<br />Sensitive soul - that power of the soul through which a living thing is aware of its environment, as through touch, smell, taste, hearing and sight. The difference between animals and plants is that animals have a sensitive soul while plants do not.<br />Intellectual soul - that power of the soul that gives the ability to reason. According to Thomas, the intellectual soul differs from the nutritive and sensitive soul in that it is not just a form, but a substance as well, and so can exist withoutthe body. Much of &quot;Summa Contra Gentiles: Creation&quot; is devoted to establishing this doctrine against competing doctrines of Plato, Alexander, Avicenna, and Averroes, among others.<br />Separate substances - intellectual beings without bodies, such as angels.<br />-<br />* In my review of &quot;Summa Contra Gentiles: God&quot;, I included definitions for more basic Aristotelian terms than these, such as form, matter, substance, etc. Readers unfamiliar with these more basic terms might want to read that review.	2002-07-26

The table of contents is as follows:<br />General Introduction<br />The Excellence of Marriage (with introduction and notes)<br />Holy Virginity (with introduction and notes)<br />The Excellence of Widowhood (with introduction and notes)<br />Adulterous Marriages (with introduction and notes)<br />Continence (with introduction and notes)<br />Index of Scripture<br />General Index<br />All of the works in this collection were translated by Ray Kearney. In addition to the General Introduction, each work has a short introduction of its own and notes at the end. The introductions and notes are by David G. Hunter. The introductions aim to provide historical context for the works, with the general introduction providing an overview of the twenty-year period from which these works were written, and the individual introductions providing the background for each particular work. The notes supplied at the end mostly identify Augustine's references to other works, both by himself and by others. The supplementary material is not copious, but doesn't really need to be; none of the works in this collection is obscure or difficult.<br />\\"The Excellence of Marriage\\" was one of Augustine's most influential works. He wrote it to define the purpose of marriage and to defend it as a good - not as good as holy virginity but a good nevertheless. To this end, he defined the purpose of marriage (what goods it brings to those in the married state), and from this what the duties of marriage must therefore be. It is a work at once strange and familiar. It is strange in the pains it takes to defend the idea that marriage is not actually sinful (a charge that few would even think to make today). It is familiar in that many of the most criticized aspects of the Catholic view of marriage, such as the denial of divorce and the sinfulness of non-procreative sex, are presented and defended in this work. It is a powerful presentation of these embattled points of doctrine and well worth reading.<br />\\"Holy Virginity\\" is a work that necessarily followed Augustine's works on marriage. Having defended the goodness of marriage, a defense of the superior goodness of virginity was required. The argument is rhetorical in form and scriptural in content. The main purpose is completed fairly quickly - Augustine draws on the lives of Mary, Jesus, the Apostles, and the teachings of Paul to establish that holy virginity is a good thing. Surprisingly, he then devotes considerable space to warning those practicing virginity not to be over-proud of their state and its superiority over marriage and to caution those practicing virginity to humility.<br />\\"The Excellence of Widowhood\\" is a long letter written to a widow asking Augustine's advice. In content it is fairly thin, but it was interesting to note that in it Augustine explicitly names a simple principal underlying much of his writing - precept first, then exhortation. The precept here (that widowhood is an honorable state) is a small one, and is treated at much more length than its worth would seem to warrant.<br />\\"Adulterous Marriages\\" is a treatment of a variety of possible issues and complications surrounding adultery, particularly with regard to separation and remarriage. It was built on the same theological foundations as \\"The Good of Marriage\\", but was aimed less at expounding doctrine than answering possible objections to it and clarifying the finer points. It almost serves as a set of appendices to that prior and more foundational work.<br />\\"Continence\\" was written, surprising as it may seem to a modern audience, not to defend continence but to defend the goodness of creation in general and marriage in particular. The opposing position was Manichaean dualism, which taught that everything good was in the soul and everything bad was in the body. As he so often had to do, Augustine had to attack one extreme while at thesame time not seeming to endorse the other.	2002-07-02

The table of contents is as follows:<br />The Heresies (with Introduction and correspondence between Augustine and Quodvultdeus)<br />To Orosius in Refutation of the Priscillianists and Origenists (with Introduction and Orosius's \\"Memorandum to Augustine on the Error of the Priscillianists and Origenists\\")<br />Answer to the Arian Sermon (with Introduction and \\"The Arian Sermon\\", by an unknown author)<br />Debate with Maximus (with Introduction)<br />Answer to Maximus the Arian (with Introduction)<br />Answer to an Enemy of the Law and the Prophets (with Introduction)<br />Index of Scripture<br />Index<br />The translations, introductions, and notes are by Roland J. Teske. The supplementary material provided by Teske is quite good. He gives every work its own introduction, which he uses primarily to provide the historical context of the work. The extensive notes which Teske provides are used mainly to identify Augustine's references to people, movements and other works. The index, interestingly, locates references by the book and chapter in the structure of the original work rather than the page number in this edition. The only caveat I would have is that I prefer notes at the bottom of each page, rather than collected together at the end of each work, which is how Teske does it.<br />\\"The Heresies\\", the first work in this collection, was written as a reluctant response to repeated requests by a deacon of Carthage, Quodvultdeus. Quodvultdeus wanted a short summary of all the heresies that had existed since the beginning of Christianity. Augustine replied that it had already been done, and that there was no need for him to add another, but finally gave in and wrote it. Augustine's original plan was to prepare the work in two parts - the first listing and describing the heresies and the second defining what a heresy was. Augustine completed the first part, which is heavily derivative (as Augustine had complained that it would be), but Augustine died before writing the second part, which would likely have been the more interesting of the two.<br />\\"To Orosius...\\" is a short work. It was written against two heretical doctrines. The first was the Priscillianist belief that man's soul is part of God, as distinct from the orthodox Christian belief that the man's soul is a creation of God. The second was the Origenist belief that all spiritual beings created by God were equal at first, and then assigned bodies according to their merits, and that all (including the devil) could be redeemed. Against the first, Augustine argued that the soul could not be part of God because the soul was changeable while God was not. Against the second, Augustine argued that such a doctrine had some absurd aspects and was not supported by scripture.<br />\\"Answer to the Arian Sermon\\" was written in refutation to an Arian creed. While this document no longer exists, so much of it is quoted by Augustine that a reconstruction is possible. The central Arian doctrine asserted therein and attacked by Augustine was the Arian concept of the Trinity - not as a single God, but as three different divine beings: The Father, who begot the Son, and the Holy Spirit, who proceeded from the Son. The unity of God, according to the Arian position, was a unity of opinion, not of being. Augustine's rebuttal was primarily scriptural, focusing on the Old Testament assertions that there is only one God, and that the Arian position contradicted that scripture.<br />\\"Debate with Maximus\\" and \\"Answer To Maximus\\" are properly taken together. Near the end of his life, Augustine was summoned to debate Maximus, an Arian bishop. The debate degenerated into speeches, in which Arian's were much the longer. The debate was to be followed by an exchange of essays, of which only Augustine's survives (it is not known whether Maximus even wrote his). The documents are not a total success from the reader's point ofview. The first problem is that the level of ad hominem on both sides is rather high, and while it might have been an expected rhetorical style, it does not advance the reader's understanding of either position. The second problem is that the format resulted in documents that are somewhat repetitive and not particularly well structured. The content is similar to \\"Answer to the Arian Sermon\\".<br />\\"Answer to an Enemy...\\" was written in rebuttal to a document circulating that was an attack on the God of the Old Testament, holding Him to be both evil and an antagonist of Jesus Christ, who was man's saviour from that God. Scripture that held to the contrary was asserted to be Jewish fabrication. Augustine's rebuttal focused on the continuity of the Old Testament and the New, that the alleged differences in God and Jesus were the result of selective citation of scripture, and that the unity of the Old and New Testament could clearly be seen in that the Old foretold the New in prophecy. Much of the \\"Enemy's\\" line of argument is still used by enemies of Christianity today, and much of Augustine's counter-arguments retain their value in Christian apologetics.	2002-06-30

St. Augustine, Vol. 1: The Literal Meaning of Genesis (Ancient Christian Writers)	Books	5	68	72	N	N	Augustine on creation	First, this work has been published in two volumes, which Amazon has mistakenly listed as being different editions. To find both volumes, click on the \\"All Editions\\" link.<br />Although it is published in two volumes, readers should not be intimidated by this. The work proper is only about 400 pages long (a third the length of Augustine's \\"City of God\\"), and reads quite easily.<br />As to why it was broken in two volumes, the answer lies in the 300 pages supplemental material, which would have made it quite bulky had it been published in a single volume. The quality and readability of this material, mostly presented in notes to the text, is quite high, and I found that it made an already enjoyable and interesting work even more so.<br />As to the work itself, it is concerned with the first three chapters of the Book of Genesis, ending with the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. The subjects addressed through this work are biblical exegesis, God, the angels, Satan, heaven and earth, man, the soul, and the fall.<br />Augustine began his work on the subject of biblical exegesis - how scripture is to be interpreted. He proposed four senses: \\"the eternal truths that are taught, the facts that are narrated, the future events that are predicted, and the precepts or counsels that are given.\\" In this work, Augustine focused on the second of these - the facts that are narrated, which he called the literal sense. It is important to understand that although we tend to think of a 'literal' reading of scripture as one taking the words to have their most obvious meaning, that is not what Augustine meant by it. For Augustine, a literal reading meant only that the text was referring in some way to events that actually occurred, without any implication that the reference might not be very obscure. For example, Augustine understood morning, day, and evening in the days of creation to refer not to a particular times of day, but to a particular phases in the angelic knowledge of creation - the phase in which the things are known directly from God (morning), the phase in which they actually exist (day), and the state in which they are known from the senses (evening). In fact, Augustine held that in terms of time the six days of creation were actually simultaneous and included the creation of time itself.<br />Of course, the problem of how to interpret Genesis, particularly with regard to scientific knowledge, is very much a live problem today. It was however, a question even in Augustine's day, and his take on it is of considerable interest, especially for those who do believe in scripture as revelation and are unsure how to read Genesis. In his reading, Augustine on the whole was a scientific agnostic, he neither believed nor disbelieved much of what his contemporary science said about the world. He did, however, offer suggestions as to how this or that passage could be reconciled with this or that scientific belief, in order to take into account the possibility the scientific belief might well be true. If a passage seemed to him to be particularly mysterious in light of its scientific possibility (the reference to a spring that watered all the earth was one such passage), he neither sought to use scripture to determine scientific truth nor concluded that the passage was therefore false - for Augustine, a passage in scripture must be true, but it was perfectly possible for it to be true in a sense he did not understand.<br />If the first half of the work is concerned with the creation of heaven and earth, the second half is concerned with the creation and fall of man. The bridge between the two are the sections on the creation of man's body and soul. Augustine was not terribly interested in the creation of body, but the creation of the soul was another matter, one that Augustine pondered throughout his life. Were the souls of all men created at the beginning and sent to bodies later? Were souls created at the beginning and reincarnated in new bodies? Were they created by God directly at the start of each person's life? Were they generated from the souls of the parents? Were they generated from the body? While some of these positions Augustine regarded as certainly false, with regard to others he was never sure.<br />One issue that came up with regard to how the soul was created was the problem of the transmission of original sin. In Augustine's view, original sin was the decision to disobey God and eat from the tree of knowledge; the tree itself had no significance other than that God had forbidden it; by disobeying God, Adam turned man from God's grace, necessitating the sacrifice of Jesus to redeem man. While Augustine was anything but blind to metaphorical readings of the story, he also believed it to be history as well - there was a real tree, and a real man named Adam really did eat of it.<br />Augustine ended with a rather odd consideration of a short comment made by Paul in Corinthians concerning a man's (whom Augustine takes to be Paul himself) having been taken up into the third heaven and whether that heaven is the paradise from which Adam fell. It is an interesting piece, but an odd way to end a work on Genesis; but then Augustine always felt free to digress when writing, but he was seldom less interesting for having done so.	2002-04-28
US	52674203	R86HGMCDKJSIJ	0521468434	76417555	Augustine: The City of God against the Pagans (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)	Books	4	50	87	N	N	What a slog...	Although this has been published as part of the \\"Cambridge Texts on Political Thought\\" series, it is only incidentally a political work. Its proper genre is Christian Apologetics - the reasoned defense of Christian belief.<br />Augustine's motive for writing it came from the sack of Rome in 410, which many Roman pagans blamed on the Empire's abandonment of its pagan gods for Christianity. Augustine began writing it in 413, continued with it on and off for the next 13 years, before finally completing it in 426. It is by far the longest of Augustine's works.<br />Although \\"The City of God\\" is formally divided into twenty-two \\"books\\" (the books of works of this period were quite short - broadly equal to the modern chapter), the book is more a unit of length than of structure. The highest level of structure of the work is more or less as follows:<br />(1) Against the belief that the pagan gods can give rewards in this life (5 books)<br />(2) Against the belief that the pagan gods can give rewards in the next life (5 books)<br />(3) Origins of the City of God and the City of Man (4 books)<br />(4) Histories of the City of God and the City of Man (4 books)<br />(5) Comparative futures of the City of God and the City of Man (4 books)<br />The first section, against the belief that the pagan gods should be worshipped for what they can give in this life, was primarily concerned with Roman history. The pagan argument was that Rome had been prosperous while it had worshipped the pagan gods, but had suffered disaster after abandoning them. Augustine's response is a recital of disasters - civil wars and despotic rule - suffered by Rome prior to turning Christian. Augustine admitted that Christianity had not brought prosperity to Rome, but pointed out that it never promised to - that Christianity's promises of reward were not in this life, but in the infinitely more important life to come.<br />The second section was aimed not at what might be termed 'popular paganism', but at the philosophical efforts to give paganism intellectual credibility, particularly Neo-Platonism. Following the Roman writer Varro, Augustine considered the paganism of the poets, the paganism of the state, and the paganism of the philosophers. His argument was that the philosophers admit the paganism of the poets to be nonsense, but that the paganism of the state could not be separated from that of the poets and must equally be condemned. Augustine was respectful of the paganism of the philosophers, but argued that the philosophical arguments were better fulfilled in Christianity than in paganism.<br />The third section was written around an exposition of Genesis. Its purpose was to define the relationship between God and creation, God and man, man and sin, sin and death, and the nature of the life to come. In the prior two sections, Augustine was primarily on the attack, but in this section he was on the defense, explaining Christian belief and defending it against philosophical objections that he thinks either arise from misunderstandings of Christianity or mistakes in Neo-Platonism.<br />The fourth section was devoted to history - Biblical and Roman. Augustine's account of Biblical history was quite literal - the long lives of the patriarchs, for example, was taken at face value and defended as accurate history. In it, Augustine developed the division of the world into those submitting to the will of God (the City of God) and those defying it (the City of Man). Augustine's history paid particularly close attention of prophesies of the coming of Jesus, through whom the City of God would spread over the entire world.<br />The fifth section was concerned with prophecies of the future of the world, particularly in the Book of Revelation, and with the nature of the next life for both the damned and the saved. Again, Augustine was quite literal in his readings of these prophecies, although he later wrote that he had probably been too literal in some of his prophetic interpretations.<br />-<br />In the title of my review, I described the book as a slog. It is time to explain why.<br />The book's first two sections consist of a 400 page attack on the truth of Roman paganism, a conclusion that the modern reader would have conceded before reading page 1. The reader's ability to get through this is not helped by the fact that it is repetitive and that much of it will mean little to readers without a solid background in Roman history. Further distancing this section from the interest of the modern reader is Augustine's frequent invocation of aerial daemons as being behind paganism. At that time, aerial daemons were believed in by pagans and Christians alike, but few (if any) moderns still do. As a result, contemporary readers will likely find Augustine's frequent references to them more hurtful than helpful to the Christian cause.<br />The book's last three sections, of about 700 pages, are largely concerned with the Bible. The first of these, dealing with Genesis, I found by far the most interesting of the book's five sections, but I also thought that Augustine treated the subject better in his \\"The Literal Meaning of Genesis\\". The fourth section, dealing with the rest of the Old Testament, was a by-the-numbers retelling of the original that felt like a deliberate test of the reader's powers of endurance. The last section, dealing primarily with prophecy, I found largely uninteresting because I found it unconvincing, a conviction that Augustine himself, at least to some extent, later shared.<br />I've given the book four stars less for itself than its author and its historical importance. Of all the works of Augustine I have read, however, this is near the bottom of those that I would recommend based on contemporary interest.	2002-04-18

These works were his two first attempts at writing interpretations of it, but he thought them only partly successful and did not see fit to complete them. Neither work is to be confused with Augustine's &quot;The Literal Meaning of Genesis&quot;, which is a later and much longer work on the same subject that he successfully completed (that work is available in two volumes from Paulist Press).<br />Augustine's special interest in Genesis had two roots: apologetic and theological. His apologetic interest was a response to frequent attacks on Genesis by non-Christians and what he felt were inept defenses of it by uneducated Christians. His theological interest sprang from the critical importance of the Fall to Augustine's theology.<br />The first work, &quot;Two Books on Genesis against the Manichees&quot;, was primarily apologetic. It was written not long after Augustine left the Manichees to return to the Church, and was intended as a rebuttal to the Manichee attacks on Genesis. In this context, Augustine discussed Creation, Eden, and the Fall, but the work ended there - Augustine felt that he had not yet learned enough to complete the task he had undertaken successfully. The section on Creation was largely literal - reading it as a record of events that had occurred, but the section on Eden and the Fall was largely allegorical, reading it for the spiritual truth within the literal account. The chief interest I found in the work was that the description of the Eden and the Fall shows the strong influence on Augustine of classical virtue ethics, but none of the theology of Original Sin that is of such importance in his later writings.<br />The second work &quot;On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis: An Unfinished Book&quot;, was aporetic in character: in it, Augustine deepens the reader's understanding of the text by raising questions about it rather than by giving answers. This work was written not long after the previous one, and again Augustine found himself ultimately unequal to the task he had set. This work is even shorter than the previous one, and gets less far into Genesis, ending after the Creation days. I found the work pleasant to read; the aporetic style provides a sense of intimacy - that the author is sharing not only his answers with the reader, but also his questions, even if he doesn't have an answer to give.<br />The supporting material in the book is quite good - the only fault I would find is that the introduction generally refers to works by the abbreviations of their Latin names, which made me break from reading the text to his table of abbreviations (about 30 in all) far too often, a fault compounded by the fact that English translations for the titles in that table were not provided. Still, this is a pretty minor quibble.<br />As a final note, thanks are due to Teske and CUA Press for providing the first translation of these works into English.	2002-03-23

The translations are by John A. Mourant and William J. Collinge, except where noted. The preface and introductions are by William J. Collinge.<br />The table of contents is as follows:<br />Preface<br />Select Bibliography<br />Introduction to &quot;On Nature and Grace&quot;<br />Entry from &quot;The Retractions&quot; on &quot;On Nature and Grace&quot;<br />&quot;On Nature and Grace&quot;<br />Introduction to &quot;On the Proceedings of Pelagius&quot;<br />Entry from &quot;The Retractions&quot; on &quot;On the Proceedings of Pelagius&quot;<br />&quot;On the Proceedings of Pelagius&quot;<br />Introduction to &quot;On the Predestination of the Saints&quot; and &quot;On the Gift of Perseverance&quot;<br />Letters of Prosper and Hilary (translated by Wilfrid Parsons)<br />&quot;On the Predestination of the Saints&quot;<br />&quot;On the Gift of Perseverance&quot;<br />General Index<br />Index of Holy Scripture<br />The first work in this collection, &quot;On Nature and Grace&quot;, was written in response to a book by Pelagius called &quot;De Natura&quot;. It is a disputatious work, in which Augustine alternates between quotes from the book that he took issue with, and his own rebuttals to those quotes. The issues revolved around original sin, the Fall, and the meaning of grace. Pelagius advanced a position that grace was identical with human nature, which was had in the same degree by all men, and that Adam's sin had not fundamentally changed man's ability to live a sinless life through his own free will. Augustine's position was that the Fall had changed man, and that all men thereafter suffered a loss of grace, which left them unable to sin without a restoration of grace from God. I did not find this Augustine's best work on the subject. Augustine writes best when the structure of his writing is his own; when constrained, as he is here, by the structure of someone else's writing, he tends to be repetitive and cramped.<br />The second work, &quot;On the Proceedings of Pelagius&quot;, was written in the wake of the synod of Diaspolis, which questioned Pelagius on questions concerning his orthodoxy and ruled that his beliefs did not contradict the faith of the Church. This decision vastly annoyed Augustine, who felt that the synod had not pressed Pelagius hard enough and had let him get away with giving half-answers to the questions it had posed him. In this work, Augustine undertook the politically delicate task of attacking the synod's ruling without attacking the synod's members. To this end, Augustine alternately explained the heresies behind Pelagius' half-answers and gave the synod excuses for having accepted them. The work's primary interest is in the careful delineation of exactly what about the Pelagian position was heretical. It is of less interest as a source for Augustine's own theology, which he explained better in his other works (I would recommend &quot;Admonition and Grace&quot; particularly). <br />The third and fourth works &quot;On the Predestination of the Saints&quot; and &quot;On the Gift of Perseverance&quot;, are closely related. They were written not against Pelagius himself, nor any of his followers, but against a separate group that had objected to the strong positions that Augustine had adopted in the course of the Pelagian controversy. This group has since come to be known by the misleading label of the &quot;semi-Pelagians&quot;. The particular point of disagreement was Augustine's views on predestination, which left grace as an entirely gratuitous gift of God, with no basis in human action. His opponents instead held that man's free will was the starting point for God's grace and that men could thereby choose to be saved of their own will. Augustine denied this on the basis of scripture, and addressed some practical objections they raised to the doctrine (in particular how asceticism and preaching could be carried on consistently with it). I found the works useful in understanding the basis for Augustine's theology, but I would not recommend that they be read in isolation. As with so many of Augustine's disputatious writings, they are focused on the points at hand and do not address the more subtle aspects of Augustine's theology and can lead to an over-simplified impression of it.<br />Insofar as the editorial materials are concerned, the introductions and summaries are quite useful, as are the plentiful notes.	2002-03-15

Scriptural references are few and their meaning is not obvious - indeed, they can easily be read as contradictory. In fact, there is no explicit description of the Trinity in the scriptures at all - the orthodox view of the Trinity (three persons in one God) is an inferential conclusion from scripture that took generations to piece together. Having arrived at that conclusion, the next problem was to understand exactly what it meant - a problem difficult enough that many argued that it was simply a mystery the answer to which we might know in the next life but not this.<br />This famously difficult problem is the subject of Augustine's &quot;The Trinity&quot;. In addressing it, he has two motives. His first motive is to combat non-Trinitarian heresy by showing the scriptural support for the concept and by showing that it is not inherently contradictory. His second motive is to attempt to understand the Trinity more deeply, to satisfy the scriptural directive to &quot;seek His face evermore&quot;.<br />&quot;The Trinity&quot; is a long book, the second longest work in the Augustinian corpus, and one that he worked on, intermittently, for sixteen years. He might not have finished it had not the unauthorized publication of the first twelve &quot;books&quot;, led him to write the final three in order to avoid having the work available only in an incomplete form.<br />&quot;The Trinity&quot; begins with a consideration of the Scriptural references to the Trinity, with the aim of reconciling them and explaining them through the supposition of three equal persons in one God. Augustine is at particular pains to maintain the equality of the persons: that the Son is equal to the Father, and the Holy Spirit equal to both. Of particular concern to Augustine are the references to the Son and Holy Spirit being sent, with the implication that the Father who sends must be superior to them. This presentation takes up the first eight books.<br />From there Augustine aims to develop some deeper understanding of the nature of the Trinity. His approach is to use the fact that the Man was created in the image of God. Given this, Augustine reasons, there should be some image of the Trinity in man. This leads to the consideration of a succession of trinities - the lover, beloved, and love; memory, understanding, and will; the objects of sense, the will to attend to them, and the sense impressions of them; etc. This presentation, which take up the next four books, is interesting, but often perplexing. It is easy for the reader to see that the trinities he names are not analogues of the divine Trinity, and it can be perplexing to attempt to understand how Augustine intends to bring this discussion of the trinities in man together.<br />It is in the last few books, written after the premature publication of the earlier books, that Augustine works to reverse the centrifugal tendencies of his discussion of the trinities in man and unify them into a whole. The trinities in man are held up not as exact analogues to that in God, but as a ladder, starting with the most carnal and rising towards the most spiritual; we do not find a single Trinity like that of God within ourselves, but we do find a series of them that we can ascend, and in ascending it we approach the divine Trinity and a deeper understanding of God.	2002-02-14

He wrote it to define the purpose of marriage and to defend it as a good - not as good as holy virginity but a good nevertheless. To this end, he defined the purpose of marriage (what goods it brings to those in the married state), and from this what the duties of marriage must therefore be. It is a work at once strange and familiar. It is strange in the pains it takes to defend the idea that marriage is not actually sinful (a charge that few would even think to make today). It is familiar in that many of the most criticized aspects of the Catholic view of marriage, such as the denial of divorce and the sinfulness of non-procreative sex, are presented and defended in this work. It is a powerful presentation of these embattled points of doctrine and well worth reading.<br />\\"Adulterous Marriages\\" is a treatment of a variety of possible issues and complications surrounding adultery, particularly with regard to separation and remarriage. It was built on the same theological foundations as \\"The Good of Marriage\\", but was aimed less at expounding doctrine than answering possible objections to it and clarifying the finer points. It almost serves as aset of appendices to that prior and more foundational work.<br />\\"Holy Virginity\\" is a work that necessarily followed Augustine's works on marriage. Having defended the goodness of marriage, a defense of the superior goodness of virginity was required. The argument is rhetorical in form and scriptural in content. The main purpose is completed fairly quickly - Augustine draws on the lives of Mary, Jesus, the Apostles, and the teachings of Paul to establish that holy virginity is a good thing. Surprisingly, he then devotes considerable space to warning those practicing virginity not to be over-proud of their state and its superiority over marriage and to caution those practicing virginity to humility.<br />\\"Faith and Works\\" concerns what the title suggests it concerns. The launching point, however, is the narrower question of whether pagan converts should be educated in the requirements of a Christian life before or after baptism. This question leads Augustine into the question of how important the Christian life is to salvation: do works matter? Augustine's answer and the scripture used in addressing this point is the Catholic position. It relies on Peter, John, James, and Jude as counterweights to the \\"faith alone\\" reading of Paul, and in fascinating in showing how the question did not arise suddenly in the sixteenth century but in fact had very old roots (Augustine in fact regards it as old even in his own time, and as having been settled in the time of the Apostles).<br />\\"The Creed\\" is a short work, originally given as a sermon, explaining the meaning of the Creed to a lay audience. Augustine went slowly through the Creed, explaining each line's meaning in clear terms, and avoiding  theological heavy lifting.<br />\\"Faith and the Creed\\" is a slightly longer work than its predecessor, and was aimed at a more sophisticated audience. It also works slowly through the Creed, but its main occupation is using it as a means of differentiating Catholic from Manichaean belief, naturally to the credit of the former.<br />\\"The Care to be Taken for the Dead\\" is a sensitive work for those dealing with the problem of the proper care for the dead and what - if any - consequences it has for the life to come. Augustine finds that the reason for respectful care for the dead lies not out of concern for the next life (where it has no effect), but out of concern for those still alive, that care of the dead is an opportunity for a final show of respect for the deceased. In doing so, Augustine gives comfort to those who cannot care for loved ones who have died, without making it seem as though those who can are foolish in doing so.<br />\\"In Answer to the Jews\\" aims to defend the Christian interpretations of messianic prophecy in the Old Testament against Jewish objections. There was a substantial Jewish population in North Africa where Augustine was bishop, and he sought to fortify local Christians with a defense of Christian belief about the Old Testament.<br />\\"The Divination of Demons\\" is a short piece intended to explain a question that seldom troubles Christians today: how could demons prophecy the future and if they could didn't it make them worthy of worship? Without claiming to have every heard a demon prophecy anything, Augustine argues that they could do so by merely natural means, and that this would not even necessarily make them better than men, much less worthy of worship.	2002-02-14

US	52674203	R1Y3RK2IUW8KKX	0451526295	569473707	Mansfield Park	Books	5	221	229	N	N	Loved and Hated	&quot;Mansfield Park&quot; has always been Jane Austen's most controversial novel.<br />The heroine of the book is Fanny Price, a powerless and socially marginal young woman. To almost everyone she knows, she barely exists. As a child, she is sent to live with the family of her wealthy uncle. Her parents give her up without regret, and her uncle only takes her in because he is deceived into doing so. Fanny's wealthy relations, when they deign to notice her at all, generally do so only to make sure she knows of her inferiority and keeps in her place. Fanny is thus almost completely alone, the only kindness she receives coming from her cousin Edmund. Forced by circumstances to be an observer, Fanny is a faultlessly acute one, as well as the owner of a moral compass that always points true north.<br />Those who dislike &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; almost invariably cite Fanny as the novel's central fault. She is generally accused of being two things: (1) too passive, and (2) too moral.<br />The charge of passivity is perplexing. Surely it is evident that for her to challenge those in power over her is extremely dangerous - in fact, when she finally does challenge them, on a matter of the greatest importance to her and of next to no importance to them, she is swiftly reminded of the weakness of her situation by being deported back to the impoverished family of her parents, who receive her with indifference.<br />The charge of morality is easier to understand - many readers feel themselves being silently accused by Fanny, and they don't like it. The interesting thing is that those same readers often enjoy &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, even though it is evident that the same moral standards are in place in both books. So, why do readers feel the prick of criticism in one and not the other?<br />Part of the answer is that in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; the stakes are higher, which squeezes out the levity of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, can afford to smile at the follies of others - they are not dangerous to her (at least she thinks not - she comes to think differently before the book is over). Fanny, however, can seldom afford to laugh. Vices that are funny in the powerless can be frightening in the powerful. Fanny's vulnerability to the faults of others is clear to her, and she suffers for it throughout &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;.<br />Another part of the answer is that attractions that are combined in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; are split in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Mr. Darcy is both rich and good; in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, Henry Crawford is only rich. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Elizabeth Bennet is both witty and good; in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, Fanny Price is only good. Readers who liked &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; because it had a rich man attracted to a witty woman, will either find nothing in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; to engage their enthusiasms, or, as is not uncommon, they will actually find themselves drawn to the book's sometimes-antagonists, the Crawfords.<br />Having dealt with why some people dislike &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, it remains to deal with why other people like it. Its central attraction is the skillful blending of the story of Fanny Price herself, which is the Jane Austen's adaptation of the &quot;Cinderella&quot; archetype, and the story of the other characters, which are of the great Christian themes of fall and redemption.<br />&quot;Cinderella&quot;, is of course the story of hope for the powerless. It has been subject to a certain amount of well-intended misreading in recent decades, but the motive for that misreading really concerns an accident of the eponymous story - the sex of the main character - rather than its real theme, which is universal. &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, for example, shows how easily and successfully the Cinderella archetype can be applied to a maleprotagonist.<br />Fall and redemption is the other story of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;. At the start, the characters other than Fanny are fallen or falling. Some are so corrupt that we are have no hope for them; their presence is purely malign, endangering those not so badly off as themselves. Others have fallen far, but are not quite so far gone that we do not have hope for them as well as fear of them. Finally, there are those who are only beginning to fall, whose danger is all the more alarming for it.<br />In &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, these stories are not just side by side, they are interwoven. Jane Austen's Cinderella saves not only herself, but also saves - and almost saves - others as well. All but the worst characters in the book are drawn to the goodness in Fanny, even while they yield to the temptations that threaten them. The book has real tension in that we don't know who will make it and who will not. Those who feel sympathy for the Crawfords are not entirely misreading the story - we are not wrong when we sympathize with a drowning man clutching at a rope thrown to him. Where we can go wrong is not when we wish not for the drowning man to be pulled to shore, but when we wish for the person at the other end of the rope to be pulled in after him.	2001-09-18

Less known is that Lewis also wrote a few genre short stories and was the author of a number of short works about the genre. Those stories and short works are the subject of this collection.<br />These works, like the rest of Lewis's shorter works, have been collected and published in book form multiple times. Trying to determine what works are in what collections is, for that reason, difficult, and to complicate matters more, some works appear have appeared under more than one title.<br />To aid readers, in this review I've listed the works in this collection, with notes indicating other collections they have appeared in. Where a work has appeared under more than one title, I give both titles separated by a slash.<br />Table of Contents:<br />(Essays)<br />&quot;On Stories&quot; / &quot;The Kappa Element in Romance&quot; (1), (3)<br />&quot;On Three Ways of Writing for Children&quot; (1), (3)<br />&quot;Sometimes Fairy Stories May Say Best What's to be Said&quot; (1), (3)<br />&quot;On Juvenile Tastes&quot; (1), (3)<br />&quot;It All Began with a Picture ...&quot; (1), (3)<br />&quot;On Criticism&quot; (1), (3)<br />&quot;On Science Fiction&quot; (1), (3)<br />&quot;A Reply to Professor Haldane&quot; (1)<br />&quot;Unreal Estates&quot; / &quot;The establishment must die and rot ...&quot; (1), (3)<br />(Stories)<br />&quot;The Shoddy Lands&quot;  (2), (3)<br />&quot;Ministering Angels&quot;  (2), (3)<br />&quot;Forms of Things Unknown&quot;  (2), (3), (4)<br />&quot;After Ten Years&quot; (an unfinished novel)  (2), (3)<br />Notes:<br />(1) also published in &quot;On Stories, and Other Essays&quot;<br />(2) also published in &quot;The Dark Tower and Other Stories&quot;<br />(3) also published in &quot;Essay Collection and Other Short Pieces&quot;<br />(4) Lewis's authorship of this is disputed.<br />Recommendations:<br />In general, to anyone interested in Lewis's shorter works, my best advice is to get &quot;Essay Collection and Other Short Pieces&quot;, which, as of the time of this writing, is available from Amazon UK but not Amazon US. That collection consists of about 130 short works by Lewis. The works in that collection are mostly Christian, but it also includes almost everything in &quot;On Stories, and Other Essays&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Tower and Other Stories&quot; (which in turn contain everything in this collection).<br />If you are interested in Lewis's science fiction and fantasy, and your budget or enthusiasm does not run to &quot;Essay Collection and Other Short Pieces&quot;, then my second-best advice is to get &quot;On Stories, and Other Essays&quot; plus &quot;The Dark Tower and Other Stories&quot;. (If you don't want essays about the genre, and only the stories themselves, then you can skip &quot;On Stories, and Other Essays&quot;). If you get both of those books, don't buy this one - you'll be wasting your money.<br />If your budget or interest doesn't stretch to cover both of the afore-mentioned books, then my third-best advice is to buy this book.<br />Those whose interest in Lewis' work as a literary critic and whose taste is not limited to science fiction and fantasy may also want to consider the following additional two collections (neither has been included in &quot;Essay Collection and Other Short Pieces&quot;):<br />&quot;Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Literature&quot;<br />&quot;Selected Literary Essays&quot; (out of print)	2001-09-13

Lewis at Work	Lewis's fame as a writer of Christian apologetics, fantasy, and science fiction is such that it's easy to forget his day job: professor of medieval literature first at Oxford then Cambridge.<br />Although his professional output was fairly modest in quantity, in quality it enjoys a high reputation. His longer works include &quot;The Allegory of Love&quot;, &quot;English Literature in the Sixteenth Century&quot;, &quot;Studies in Words&quot;, and &quot;The Discarded Image&quot;. In addition to these, he also wrote a number of short works, which are published in this volume. To aid readers, I've listed the table of contents below:<br />Preface (by Walter Hooper)<br />&quot;De Audiendis Poetis<br />&quot;The Genesis of a Medieval Book&quot;<br />&quot;Imagination and Thought in the Middle Ages&quot;<br />&quot;Dante's Similes&quot;<br />&quot;Imagery in the Last Eleven Cantos of Dante's Comedy&quot;<br />&quot;Dante's Statius&quot;<br />&quot;The Morte Darthur&quot;<br />&quot;Tasso&quot;<br />&quot;Edmund Spenser, 1552-99&quot;<br />&quot;On Reading the Faerie Queene&quot;<br />&quot;Neoplatonism in the Poetry of Spenser&quot;<br />&quot;Spenser's Cruel Cupid&quot;<br />&quot;Genius and Genius&quot;<br />&quot;A Note on Comus&quot;<br />Additional Editorial Notes<br />Index<br />None of these works are available in any other in-print collection (unusual for Lewis - his other shorter works have been collected multiple times in a variety of overlapping collections). As such, for those interested in the subject matter, this collection is highly recommended.<br />A second important collection of Lewis's writings as a literary critic is &quot;Selected Literary Essays&quot;, which unfortunately is out of print and very hard to find. Another such collection to consider, (largely concerned with the science fiction and fantasy genres), is &quot;On Stories, and Other Essays&quot;. That work is readily available.<br />Finally, those with a general interest in Lewis's shorter works may also want to get &quot;Essay Collection and Other Short Pieces&quot;, which, as of the time of this writing, is available from Amazon UK but not Amazon US. That collection consists of about 130 short works by Lewis. While the collection centers around his writings on Christianity, it also includes a number of works of literary criticism, including all the works in &quot;Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories&quot;.ks may also want to get &quot;Essay Collection and Other Short Pieces&quot;, which, as of the time of this writing, is available from Amazon UK but not Amazon US.

Given that their topicality has now aged about half a century, this is hardly the most valuable set of writings Lewis has left us. Most readers of Lewis can safely pass.<br />For those Lewis readers who can't get enough, this collection does have merit, but I would suggest that such folk instead get &quot;Essay Collection &amp; Other Short Pieces&quot;, which, as of the time of this writing, is available from Amazon UK but not Amazon US. That collection consists of about 130 short works by Lewis. It includes everything in this collection as well as almost all of his Christian writings (Lewis's Literary writings are, however, sadly under-represented in that collection).<br />If you love Lewis but your budget does not run to &quot;Essay Collection &amp; Other Short Pieces&quot;, then you can go ahead and get this collection. Its only other overlap is with &quot;Compelling Reason&quot;, a collection that nobody should get.	2001-09-04

On the Beatitudes**<br />Index.<br />* The sermons so marked and the numbers assigned them are taken from a collection published by Michael Denis in 1792.<br />** Taken from Dom Germain Morin's \\"Miscellanea Agostiniana\\".<br />Although the title work of this book is Augustine's close commentary on the Sermon on the Mount, the book also includes the chapter concerning the commentary taken from Augustine's \\"Retractions\\", as well as seventeen of Augustine's sermons: ten of which took their themes from the Sermon on the Mount, and seven others that were included because they had not (at the time of writing) ever been translated into English.<br />Scriptural commentary is not generally regarded as Augustine's greatest strength as a theologian; held closely to the text and the order of presentation in the text, he could not address the deep questions which the text as a whole raised, but at which individual passages in their immediate context only hinted, and it was in addressing the deep questions that Augustine excelled.<br />Apart from their questions concerning their excellence, Augustine's method of commentary may seem quite surprising to those familiar with the more modern historical approach. Augustine's focus is on symbol-systems. Here, for example, is Augustine's commentary on the first partof Matthew 6:6:<br />\\"'But,' says He, 'when you pray, go into your bedrooms.' Now, what are these bedrooms but the very hearts that are signified also in the Psalm wherein it is said: 'The things you say in your hearts, be sorry for in your bedrooms.' He then continues: 'And closing the doors, pray in secret to you Father.' Our entering the rooms is not enough if the door be left open to the importunate, for external things rush brazenly in through this door, and lay hold on our innermost affections ... Therefore, the door must be closed;\\"<br />By way of contrast, Daniel J. Harrington, in the modern form, writing on the same passage from \\"Sacra Pagina: The Gospel of Matthew\\", says:<br />\\"The Greek word tameion can refer to a 'storage room' or 'pantry', the innermost room in the house. In either case the idea is the room least likely to attract public notice. Perhaps such a room had no windows ... Matthew 6:1-18 functions as part of the attack against Jewish opponents of the Matthean community.\\"<br />Of course, the two forms of commentary are not mutually exclusive - a reader may hold both, either, or neither to be good readings. Some of course, may hold to the Harrington's form exclusively, and reject Augustine's symbol systems as imaginary. Others may hold to the Augustine's form exclusively and reject Harrington's Matthean community as imaginary.<br />With regard to the sermons in the collection, Augustine himself always regarded his sermons as unsatisfactory, but he seems to be alone in that assessment. His sermons were admired and his style imitated for many centuries afterwards, a fact that has greatly complicated trying to determine which sermons Augustine wrote, and which were imitations of his style.<br />The editiorial material in the book includes the introduction, which provides a historical view of the works, both prior as regarding their composition, and later as to their reception and impact. Additionally, footnotes give exact references for Augustine's scriptural citations, translation issues, and references to other works of Augustine's or of others. Finally, the work has an index, which is, however, only fair.	2001-08-28
US	52674203	R1MQHK7PVZRAIJ	9990667403	137388406	Fathers of the Church: St Augustine: The Happy Life	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Hard to find, but worth it	The table of contents is as follows:<br />Forward (Ludwig Schopp)<br />The Happy Life (translation and introduction by Ludwig Schopp)<br />Answer to Skeptics (translation and introduction by Denis J. Kavanagh)<br />Divine Providence and the Problem of Evil (translation and introduction by Robert P. Russell)<br />Soliloquies (translation and introduction by Thomas F. Gillian)<br />Index<br />Augustine is a highly unusual figure from this period in that we know so much about him. This is in part because he wrote voluminously, in part because he wrote both spiritual and literary autobiographies (&quot;Confessions&quot; and &quot;Retractions&quot; respectively), and in part because his works were so highly esteemed by the Church that enough copies of them were made that they were largely able to survive the collapse of classical civilization in the west.<br />The works in this collection are all early works of St. Augustine, written while he was staying in a villa near Milan shortly following his conversion. All are philosophical rather than scriptural in character. As a new convert, Augustine's knowledge of scripture was not yet great and these works show us much about his intellectual development up to that point. All were written in the form of dialogues - the first three as semi-transcriptions of discussions he actually had while in Milan, and the fourth as an internal dialogue (!) between himself and &quot;Reason&quot;.<br />&quot;The Happy Life&quot; (De beata vita) is the first-published of the works of St. Augustine's that we still have. It was written shortly after his conversion. The writing of it overlapped &quot;Answer to Skeptics&quot;, which was begun first but completed afterwards. The main points covered in the dialogue are the relation between desire and happiness, the relation between seeking or having God and happiness, and then the relation between want and misery. The flow is a little meandering until a monologue by Augustine at the end which ties happiness to having truth, which means recognizing God.<br />&quot;Answer to Skeptics&quot; (Contra Academicos), the second work in the collection, was begun before but completed after &quot;The Happy Life&quot;, and includes the same participants and locale. It is a longer and more substantial work than &quot;The Happy Life&quot;. The skeptical arguments are presented with much more force than are the opposing views in that other work, which generally gives it more interest. The &quot;Skeptics&quot; argued against here are the philosophers of the New Academy, which descended from and broke with the original Academy founded by Plato. The dialogue begins by inquiring after the nature of wisdom - whether it is seeking knowledge or having knowledge, the skeptical position being that knowledge was not possible, and the wise man took no positions but always maintained doubt. Most of the real points made in the dialogue by Augustine come at the end, after the dialogue format has been essentially abandoned and a switch is made to a monologue. The main points of rebuttal concern whether the skeptics would in fact have to at least know what wisdom is, whether those who claim to not know whether anything was true could claim to know what was likely to be true, the certainty of mathematical and logical knowledge, and whether the skeptical view could be maintained in practice without contradiction.<br />&quot;Divine Providence and the Problem of Evil&quot; (de Ordine) is perhaps not well served by the obviously loose translation of the title. It is not nearly so ambitious a work as the translator's title would suggest; it really does no more than erect a scaffolding, an order, if you will for approaching the problem. Like the prior two dialogues, it improves at the end, when Augustine switches from the dialogue form to a more or less straight monologue. In his &quot;Retractions&quot;, Augustine expressed dissatisfaction with the amount of praise he had heaped upon (non-Christian) classical philosophy and expressions concerning fortune that together give the work a surprisingly Pagan flavor.<br />&quot;Soliloquies&quot; is that last and densest of the works in this collection. It's odd form of a dialogue between Augustine and &quot;Reason&quot; anticipates, and perhaps inspired Boethius's dialogue with &quot;Philosophy&quot; in his &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;. In content it is largely concerned with the question of truth and falsity, which is treated both epistemologically and metaphysically. It is full of interest, but requires sustained attention to read. Whereas the other works in this collection tend to only show off Augustine's intellectual power near the end, this one shows him at a high level throughout. A highly recommended, if little read, work.<br />With regard to the supporting material, it is generally good. The notes are first rate, the introductions good, and the index so-so. I did find Schopp's forward a little effusive - not so much because I think he overrates Augustine's significance, but because Augustine's prominence is so great that it is beyond Schopp's (and of course my) power to add to it, and the attempt to do so doesn't and can't work.	2001-08-21
US	52674203	R291V2UKIHGG95	0813200164	631683458	016: The Fathers of the Church: Saint Augustine : Treatises on Various Subjects (Fathers of the Church Series)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Moral and practical theology	The contents of this collection are as follows:<br />Preface - by Roy J. Deferrari<br />The Christian Life (not by Augustine - probably by the Pelagian Fastidius), introduction and translation by Mary Sarah Muldowney<br />Lying - introduction and translation by Mary Sarah Muldowney<br />Against Lying - introduction and translation by Harold B.

Clement Eagan<br />The Work of Monks - introduction and translation by Mary Francis McDonald<br />The Usefulness of Fasting - introduction and translation by Mary Sarah Muldowney<br />The Eight Questions of Dulcitius - introduction and translation by Mary Deferrari<br />-<br />&quot;The Christian Life&quot;, the opening work in this collection is a curiosity because it is not by Augustine. At one time, the work was thought to have been Augustinian because of similarities in style.<br />&quot;On Lying&quot; is an ethical work addressing the question as to whether it was ever justifiable to lie. Augustine here argues strongly against the position, taking various scenarios which ostensibly would justify lying and for each suggesting alternative courses of action that would not require it. It is a more thoughtful than fully developed work, and Augustine was ambivalent about it afterwards. Hypothetical case arguments and scriptural justifications are considered and rejected. In general, Augustine argues strongly in favor of a heroic stand against evil and against feigned cooperation.<br />&quot;Against Lying&quot; was written in response the question as to whether it was a good idea to lie so as to be able to infiltrate and expose Priscillianists. The Priscillianists were a heretical group who approved of lying to conceal their identities. While feigning belief in the Church, they actually worked to subvert it. Augustine, in his response takes the same strong anti-lying position as he did in &quot;On Lying&quot;, but this essay is much more focused. Augustine begins by arguing that following the Priscillianists in lying in order to catch them was really being perverted by them. He then moves on to attack the idea that lying is ever justified by Scripture, and concludes by considering a couple of the hypothetical cases that could be used to justify lying.<br />&quot;Continence&quot; was written, surprising as it may seem to a modern audience, not to defend continence but to defend the goodness of creation in general and marriage in particular. The opposing position was Manichaean dualism, which taught that everything good was in the soul and everything bad was in the body. As he so often had to do, Augustine had to attack one extreme while at the same time not seeming to endorse the other. The work is primarily scriptural in character.<br />&quot;Patience&quot; was likely originally written as a sermon. The point of the address is whether patience is a good that can be the product of a merely human will or whether it is a gift of God. If the former, then man is capable of good of his own will, a theologically inadmissible position. If the latter, then the patience of evil men (such as robbers waiting for a victim) would seem to be divinely sponsored. Augustine answers by splitting patience according to its object - that true patience is patience aligned with charity, and that false patience is not.<br />&quot;The Excellence of Widowhood&quot; is a long letter written to a widow asking Augustine's advice. In content it is fairly thin, but it was interesting to note that in it Augustine explicitly names a simple principal underlying much of his writing - precept first, then exhortation. The precept here (that widowhood is an honorable state) is a small one, and is treated at much more length than their worth would seem to warrant.<br />&quot;The Work of Monks&quot; was written pertainingto certain monks at a monastery who refused to perform manual labor, citing the scripture &quot;Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow, or reap, or gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them.&quot; This doesn't seem a very deep subject, but Augustine, as he so often does, creates interest from the most unpromising material. A particular point worth noting is Augustine's defense of the dignity inherent in all honest work and its worthiness of Christians. This attitude towards work represented a sharp break with classical ethics, which sought dignity in either philosophy, politics, art, or war. When Plato had described manual labor as degrading, he expressed the commonplace view of the slavery-based classical civilization.<br />&quot;The Usefulness of Fasting&quot; was originally a sermon. Its purpose is to define the purpose of fasting, that it was a disciplining of the body, not a rejection of the body (a distinction important with regard to Manichaean dualism. Fasting is said to be bring the body to unity and harmony with the soul, which is compared metaphorically with bringing all men to unity and harmony within the Church.<br />&quot;Eight Questions of Dulcitius&quot; was a cut-and-paste job in which Augustine collected passages from other works of his and organized them as a response to the questions referred to in the title. The questions themselves concern the fate of the unbaptized, another concerns the reason for prayers for the dead, and still others concern the significance of selected biblical passages.	2001-08-18

Skinner begins his book at the end - near the end at any rate: &quot;As Darlington has said, 'Every new source from which man has increased his power on earth has been used to diminish the prospects of his successors. All his progress has been made at the expense of damage to his environment which he cannot repair and could not foresee.'&quot; Skinner cites a litany of woes: &quot;population ... nuclear holocaust ... pollution ... the revolt of the young.&quot;<br />So, the end is at hand and the physical sciences by themselves accelerate doomsday rather than forestall it. What do we need? &quot;What we need is a technology of behavior. ... Physics and biology have come a long way, but there has been no comparable development of anything like a science of human behavior.&quot;<br />So why do we not have such a technology? &quot;almost everyone attributes human behavior to intentions, purposes, aims, and goals. ... Unable to understand how or why the person we see behaves as he does, we attribute his behavior to a person we cannot see ... The function of this inner man is to provide an explanation which will not be explained in turn ... We say he is autonomous - and, so far as science is concerned, the miraculous.&quot; <br />So, what we must not do, if we are to save ourselves, is to place our hopes in the &quot;inner&quot; man, the &quot;autonomous&quot; man, the &quot;miraculous&quot; man - far from being the solution, our belief in him prevents us from solving our problems. But what is the correct view of man? &quot;We can follow the path taken by physics and biology by turning directly to the relation between behavior and the environment and neglecting supposed mediating states of mind. ... Behavior ... can be studied by arranging environments in which specific consequences are contingent upon it. The contingencies under investigation have become steadily more complex, and one by one they are taking over the explanatory functions previously assigned to personalities, states of mind, traits of character, purposes, and intentions. The ... result is practical: the environment can be manipulated.&quot;<br />So, once we abandon the idea of an autonomous, inner, miraculous man, then, and only then can we make progress. But are we wrong in doing so? Can we be sure that he doesn't exist? &quot;Personal exemption from a complete determinism is revoked as scientific analysis progresses, particularly in accounting for the behavior of the individual.&quot; So, we can be confident. Science demonstrates that there is no inner man, no autonomous man, no miraculous man. He doesn't exist.<br />Our problems, however, are large. They require changes to the behavior of large numbers of people. How can they be effected? &quot;Most .. contingencies are arranged by other people. They are, in fact, what is called a culture. ... It shapes and maintains the behavior of those who live in it. ... A culture which for any reason induces its members to work for its survival is more likely to survive. ... Explicit design promotes that good by accelerating the evolutionary process.&quot;<br />Thus, we learn that the solution is the design of a culture, which is made possible by the knowledge that inner, autonomous, miraculous man does not exist. Behavior is determined by the environment, the most important aspect of which is culture. To design the culture is the key. To be sure, it won't be easy:<br />&quot;A complete break with the past is impossible. The designer of a new culture will always be culture-bound, since he will not be able to free himself entirely from the predispositions which have been engendered by the social environment in which he has lived.&quot;<br />But wait, what is this? In order for the designer to do what needs to be done, he needs to &quot;free himself&quot; from his environment. But what can this mean? The behavior of the designer, the outer man, the man we can see, is scientifically known to be the product of his environment -he can no more &quot;free himself&quot; from his environment than water could decide to run uphill. If he is to be freed from the control of his environment, it could only be through the agency of an inner, autonomous, miraculous man.<br />What a sad and miserable end to our hopes! After so much build-up telling us how we can save ourselves through disdaining religion and embracing science, in the end it all depends on an inner, autonomous man, a man whose existence Skinner unhesitatingly characterizes as - a miracle.	2001-08-13

The Fathers of the Church a New Translation	Books	5	6	6	N	N	The Soul, Music, and Faith	Contents:<br />The Immortality of the Soul (translation and introduction by Ludwig Schopp)<br />The Magnitude of the Soul (translation and introduction by John J. McMahon)<br />On Music (translation and introduction by Robert Catesby Taliaferro)<br />The Advantage of Believing (translation and introduction by Luanne Meagher)<br />On Faith in Things Unseen (translation and introduction by Roy J. Deferrari and Mary Francis McDonald)<br />In &quot;The Immortality of the Soul&quot;, Augustine argues that the soul's knowledge of itself means that it is a substance, and that knowledge of eternal things (such as the truths of mathematics) means that it itself is eternal. This core argument is supplemented by additional reasons as to why the soul cannot be material or merely of a form of matter. The work is philosophical and not scriptural in character. It proceeds too quickly from its premises to its conclusions to be convincing; Augustine himself later characterized it as obscure, and that he had not meant for the draft as it was to be published. That said, the work is interesting.<br />&quot;The Magnitude of the Soul&quot; is written as a dialogue. The particular questions taken up are: &quot;(1) What is the origin of the Soul? (2) What is its nature? (3) What is its magnitude? (4) What is the reason for its union with the body? (5) What is the effect of this union? (6) What is the effect of its separation from the body?&quot; The very nature of the questions reflect Neo-Platonic concerns, and Augustine's answers tend to parallel those of Neo-Platonism as well (this does not at all mean that they were un-Christian - numerous points of compatibility exist between the two, as many noticed both then and now). As with &quot;The Immortality of the Soul&quot;, Augustine undertakes to argue for the Christian view philosophically, without reliance on scriptural authority.<br />&quot;On Music&quot; is by far the longest of the works in this collection, taking up almost half of it. At the time Augustine wrote it, he was planning a series of treatises on the liberal arts, but this series was never finished. Even this is only part of Augustine's planned treatment on music (it covers rhythm, but not melody). Taliaferro, in his introduction, states &quot;It is too easy to overlook the first five books and concentrate on the sixth&quot; (Augustine himself differentiated the sixth from the preceding books - referring to the first five, perhaps rhetorically, as childish).<br />Having tried to read &quot;On Music&quot;, I must concur with Taliaferro regarding the ease with which one can overlook the first five books. The discussion is highly technical, and while Taliaferro may be right that there is substantial value hidden within it, my background was too lacking, I think, in the musical and/or poetic terminology to enable me to feel that I was really following it. The technical character is only relieved in the sixth book, in which Augustine makes a Platonic argument in favor of the study of music - that it takes the student in the direction of mathematics and eternal things, and away from the world, and as such is a step forward in the development of the soul.<br />As a final point, &quot;On Music&quot;, at least as translated, doesn't read well - it contains quite a few sentences that are hard to even scan, such as: &quot;So this world, often called in Sacred Scriptures by the name of heaven and earth, is great by containing all things whose parts being all diminished in proportion it remains just as large.&quot; Whether the obscurity is Augustine's or Taliaferro's I don't know, but it is certainly uncharacteristic of the other translations of Augustine I've read.<br />&quot;The Advantage of Believing&quot; was written by Augustine as a letter explaining what he felt to be the errors of the Manichaeans, whom he had just left. It basically undertakes to explain what he found wanting in Manichaeaism and in what ways he found Catholicism more satisfying. Particular points concern selective Manichaean skepticism about the reliability of scripture, and the reasonableness of faith - that the Manichaean arguments against faith were as selective as their reading of scripture - that they wanted skepticism directed against others but not against themselves.<br />&quot;On Faith in Things Unseen&quot; is a short work, in the form of a rather extended sermon, which aims to justify Christian faith against those who would argue that one should only believe that which can be seen. Augustine first argues that this advice is impracticable on multiple levels - that we believe in many things we do not see, just as our own minds, the good will of their friends, the love of their parents, and so on. The counter-argument that we know those things by their signs is the launching point for Augustine's defense that we also know the truth of Christianity by its signs. In particular, Augustine focuses on fulfilled prophesy and the rapid spread of Christianity through the world.	2001-08-11
US	52674203	RSIAZV3CDAQB0	0521436109	761176342	The Cambridge Companion to Plato (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)	Books	2	130	163	N	N	Your time and money are better spent elsewhere	Plato is perhaps the most approachable of the major philosophers. His work is largely presented in short dialogues. Their brevity allow them to be read in a single sitting, and their characterizations, humor, and stories engage even the reader new to philosophy.<br />Given this, it may surprise those unfamiliar with Plato to learn that the interpretation of him has always been the subject of hot dispute - perhaps only Nietzsche among philosophers has inspired more controversy.<br />Why is this? Why is Plato so easy to read and yet so difficult?<br />Five problems are worth calling out:<br />(1) Dramatic presentation: All of Plato's published works are presented as dialogues between characters - Plato himself is never a character. Thus, any interpretation must have some mapping (implicit or explicit) between the characters' views and Plato's views, as well as how the dramatic structure (setting, characters, story) as a whole presents Plato's views.<br />(2) Irony: The main speaker in most of Plato's dialogues is Socrates, a character who often speaks ironically. Other characters can be read as sometimes being ironical as well (such as The Athenian in the dialogue &quot;Laws&quot;). Any interpretation must determine when a character is speaking ironically and when seriously.<br />(3) Stories/Myths: Characters in Plato's dialogues often tell stories whose subject matter is mythological - they concern Gods and Goddesses, the afterlife,  and other subject matter beyond ordinary human experience. Any interpretation that deals with them must determine how they are to be read.<br />(4) The Platonic Lie: In &quot;The Republic&quot;, Plato endorses (or seems to endorse) lying as a means of instilling beneficial beliefs in audiences that are unable to acquire philosophical knowledge. A beneficial belief is one that is not true in its substance, but which, if believed, will tend to the same end as would the corresponding knowledge. If we accept that this is Plato's view, then interpretations must consider whether views expressed in the dialogues are themselves Platonic Lies, and not real representations of Plato's thought.<br />(5) Historical Background: Plato lived in a time and place different from our own, whose language, customs, intellectual background, and attitudes are not ours. This is a much bigger problem than just unfamiliar names - it is the unconscious attitudes we absorb from our culture (and he from his) of which we are not necessarily even consciously aware. Different interpreters do not read these influences the same way (there is no book we can all go to called &quot;How We Thought About Things&quot;, authored by &quot;The Ancient Greeks&quot;).<br />With regard to these issues, the dominant view in &quot;A Cambridge Companion to Plato&quot; is something I would call Platonic Fundamentalism: &quot;Socrates says what Plato means, and he means what he says&quot; (this is after the Christian Fundamentalist credo: &quot;The Bible says what it means and it means what it says&quot;).<br />A difficulty with this view is that it leaves Plato contradicting himself an awful lot. The general solution presented here is the evolving-Plato theory - that the dialogues were written over a long period of time and that the contradictions represent real changes in Plato's views. The collection thus abounds in references to Plato's &quot;early dialogues&quot; or &quot;middle dialogues&quot; or &quot;late dialogues&quot;.<br />Now, there are certainly Plato scholars, past and present, who do not accept this particular interpretive framework, but their views, if raised at all,  are raised only so that they may be dismissed (sometimes in the same sentence). Those looking for substantial engagement on the problems of Platonic interpretation must look elsewhere.<br />So, given that the book does not aim to present the scholarly debate on interpreting Plato, it is fair to ask: what does it aim to do? This is an excellent question, but I could notfind the answer to it in the book itself.<br />If it were for the beginning reader, I would think it would focus on the order of reading, and on prepping the reader with background info for each dialogue so as to make reading it more rewarding. But it doesn't do anything like that.<br />If it were for the intermediate reader, I would think it would focus on illuminating doubtful passages or drawing connecting webs across disparate ones. But it doesn't do that either.<br />If it were for the advanced reader, I would think it would focus on the debates in the secondary literature, and that it would be used by peers to address peers on controversies. But it doesn't do that either.<br />So, when it comes to the ultimate question of whether I should recommend the book or not, I just can't think of anyone to whom I would recommend it.<br />Finally, to take another tack at how worthwhile a book is: the basic challenge any work of secondary literature must face is whether it is more profitable to read it, or to give the primary literature another reading instead.<br />The only work in the collection that I would say clearly passes that test is Constance Meinwald's essay on &quot;Parmenides&quot; (for those who don't know, &quot;Parmenides&quot; is by far the most formidable work in the Platonic corpus - the first half works to demolish the theory of Forms that we might otherwise hold to be Plato's view, and the second half defies the ability of most readers to make any sense of at all). Even here, however, if you want to read Meinwald's theories on &quot;Parmenides&quot; (and they are worth reading), you would do better to get her book &quot;Plato's Parmenides&quot; than to read the essay excerpted from that book included here.	2001-08-09

On the Beatitudes**<br />Index.<br />* The sermons so marked and the numbers assigned them are taken from a collection published by Michael Denis in 1792.<br />** Taken from Dom Germain Morin's &quot;Miscellanea Agostiniana&quot;.<br />Although the title work of this book is Augustine's close commentary on the Sermon on the Mount, the book also includes the chapter concerning the commentary taken from Augustine's &quot;Retractions&quot;, as well as seventeen of Augustine's sermons: ten of which took their themes from the Sermon on the Mount, and seven others that were included because they had not (at the time of writing) ever been translated into English.<br />Scriptural commentary is not generally regarded as Augustine's greatest strength as a theologian; held closely to the text and the order of presentation in the text, he could not address the deep questions which the text as a whole raised, but at which individual passages in their immediate context only hinted, and it was in addressing the deep questions that Augustine excelled.<br />Apart from their questions concerning their excellence, Augustine's method of commentary may seem quite surprising to those familiar with the more modern historical approach. Augustine's focus is on symbol-systems. Here, for example, is Augustine's commentary on the first part of Matthew 6:6:<br />&quot;'But,' says He, 'when you pray, go into your bedrooms.' Now, what are these bedrooms but the very hearts that are signified also in the Psalm wherein it is said: 'The things you say in your hearts, be sorry for in your bedrooms.' He then continues: 'And closing the doors, pray in secret to you Father.' Our entering the rooms is not enough if the door be left open to the importunate, for external things rush brazenly in through this door, and lay hold on our innermost affections ... Therefore, the door must be closed;&quot;<br />By way of contrast, Daniel J. Harrington, in the modern form, writing on the same passage from &quot;Sacra Pagina: The Gospel of Matthew&quot;, says:<br />&quot;The Greek word tameion can refer to a 'storage room' or 'pantry', the innermost room in the house. In either case the idea is the room least likely to attract public notice. Perhaps such a room had no windows ... Matthew 6:1-18 functions as part of the attack against Jewish opponents of the Matthean community.&quot;<br />Of course, the two forms of commentary are not mutually exclusive - a reader may hold both, either, or neither to be good readings. Some of course, may hold to the Harrington's form exclusively, and reject Augustine's symbol systems as imaginary. Others may hold to the Augustine's form exclusively and reject Harrington's Matthean community as imaginary.<br />With regard to the sermons in the collection, Augustine himself always regarded his sermons as unsatisfactory, but he seems to have been alone in that assessment. His sermons were admired and his style imitated for many centuries afterwards, a fact that has greatly complicated trying to determine which sermons Augustine wrote, and which were imitations of his style.<br />The editiorial material in the book includes the introduction, which provides a historical view of the works, both prior as regarding their composition, and later as to their reception and impact. Additionally, footnotes give exact references for Augustine's scriptural citations, translation issues, and references to other works of Augustine's or of others. Finally, the work has an index, which is, however, only fair.	2001-08-05

This material is supplemented by short introductions and synopses at the start of each chapter, and by abundant and detailed footnotes. The footnotes explain translation difficulties (not uncommon with Plotinus), and also identify the sources of Plotinus' references to other writers. These materials are excellent.<br />The only thing that this edition lacks is an index. The editors plead the difficulty of indexing Plotinus, and recommend &quot;Lexicon Plotinianum&quot; by J. H. Sleeman and Gilbert Pollet as an alternative. This work is, however, out of print (is it even in English? I am not sure) so it is not a very helpful suggestion. As it is, given Plotinus' rather scattered way of writing, an index is missed.<br />The Enneads are a collection of Plotinus' writings from fairly late in his life. Porphyry, his student, encouraged him in writing down his teachings, and acted as his posthumous editor (he also wrote a short biography of Plotinus which is included in the first volume). The works as they exist today are as they were received from Porphyry. As editor, Porphyry created his own organization for the works based on subject matter. This order is completely different from the order in which Plotinus wrote them. Porphyry, however, did document the original ordering.<br />From my own experience, however, I would recommend strongly reading Plotinus' writings in the order Plotinus wrote them rather than the order in which Porphyry arranged them. The major advantage I found was that it was much easier to follow the reasons why Plotinus believed what he did, even if the subject matter doesjump around a bit. I tried Porphyry's order first, and almost gave up in despair before trying again in Plotinus' order. I have come to the conclusion that much of Plotinus' reputation as a bad writer is due to unfortunate but well-intended editorial decisions by Porphyry. Given that the Loeb edition presents Plotinus' writings in Porphyry's order, and that the Loeb edition is in multiple volumes, reading Plotinus this way does have a certain entertaining quality as well (first get volume IV, read a treatise, then get volume VI, read another, then get volume I, read another, and so on).<br />An important recommendation I would make for the reader is that he be properly prepared in his background reading. All of Aristotle and all of Plato would be ideal (as well as a worthwhile activity in its own right), but if the would-be reader of Plotinus finds that a little daunting and wants to get started sooner, there are a few works that he should make a particular effort to read: Plato's &quot;Phaedo&quot;, &quot;Republic&quot; (Books VI, VII), &quot;Parmenides&quot;, and &quot;Timaeus&quot;; Aristotle's &quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, &quot;On the Soul&quot;, and &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. Plato, as the earlier writer, should be read first (by the way - don't be discouraged when you find you don't understand the second half of &quot;Parmenides&quot;, Plotinus is going to tell you what he thinks it means in due course, so all you need to do is understand the references). If you don't have Plato or Aristotle, for Plato, Cooper's &quot;Plato: Complete Works&quot; (in one volume), and for Aristotle, Barnes' &quot;Complete Works of Aristotle&quot; (in two volumes), are excellent.	2001-08-02

Readers who insist on reading works of the period with their modernism intact are &quot;as travellers who carry their resolute Englishry with them all over the continent, mixing only with other English tourists, enjoying all they see for its 'quaintness', and having no wish to realise what those ways of life, those churches, those vineyards, mean to the natives.&quot; While Lewis says &quot;I have no quarrel with people who approach the past in that spirit&quot;, he also says of them, in a somewhat chilling echo of the Sermon on the Mount: &quot;They have their reward.&quot;<br />It is to those who want a much greater reward that Lewis directs &quot;The Discarded Image.&quot; While he provides the reader with hard information concerning medieval philosophy, cosmology, biology, education and literature, imparting the individual facts is the lesser part of his purpose. What he really aims at is to completely detach the reader from all of the unconscious beliefs and attitudes that a lifetime spent in modern culture brings, and substitute for them those of the educated medieval man.<br />What the description I've just given you of this book does not do is to describe what the experience of having that done to you is like. I found it compelling and disorienting. One by one, the familiar intellectual landmarks were stripped away from my mental image of the world, and strange new ones put into their place. Vertigo is the word that comes closest to describing the feeling; I found I had to stop reading every couple dozen pages to give myself time to recover. This was so even though my familiarity with the philosophy, theology, and cosmology of the period was, by any non-specialist standard, quite high. The reason, I think was not so much that my knowledge was inferior to Lewis' (although of course it certainly was) as that I had only thought of these matters from an external &quot;objective&quot; point of view - I had never before tried to actually enter into that view of the world before. The result of Lewis' instruction on the matter was a combination of delight at the new insights so gained and humiliation at the revelation of the deep limitations of the &quot;knowledge&quot; I had possessed before.<br />In sum, I found reading &quot;the Discarded Image&quot; to be an extraordinary experience, and its value in no way depends on my using the information gained to identify some off-hand reference of Chaucer's. What Lewis describes in &quot;An Experiment in Criticism&quot;, he demonstrates here - how completely different reading is when it is done well compared to when it is merely done.	2001-07-31

US	52674203	RX48290OO8LR4	0674994892	595960473	Plotinus V: Ennead V (Loeb Classical Library, 444)	Books	5	10	13	N	N	An Excellent Edition of Plotinus	As is typical for the Loeb classical library books, the volumes are physically small, and the original text (Greek, for Plotinus) is given on the left hand page, with the English translation on the right.<br />The Preface describes the historical context within which Plotinus wrote, offers a summary of this thought, and a survey of Plotinus translations, commentaries, and studies. This material is supplemented by short introductions and synopses at the start of each chapter, and by abundant and detailed footnotes. The footnotes explain translation difficulties (not uncommon with Plotinus), and also identify the sources of Plotinus' references to other writers. These materials are excellent.<br />The only thing that this edition lacks is an index. The editors plead the difficulty of indexing Plotinus, and recommend &quot;Lexicon Plotinianum&quot; by J. H. Sleeman and Gilbert Pollet as an alternative. This work is, however, out of print (is it even in English? I am not sure) so it is not a very helpful suggestion. As it is, given Plotinus' rather scattered way of writing, an index is missed.<br />The Enneads are a collection of Plotinus' writings from fairly late in his life. Porphyry, his student, encouraged him in writing down his teachings, and acted as his posthumous editor (he also wrote a short biography of Plotinus which is included in the first volume). The works as they exist today are as they were received from Porphyry. As editor, Porphyry created his own organization for the works based on subject matter. This order is completely different from the order in which Plotinus wrote them. Porphyry, however, did document the original ordering.<br />From my own experience, however, I would recommend strongly reading Plotinus' writings in the order Plotinus wrote them rather than the order in which Porphyry arranged them. The major advantage I found was that it was much easier to follow the reasons why Plotinus believed what he did, even if the subject matter doesjump around a bit. I tried Porphyry's order first, and almost gave up in despair before trying again in Plotinus' order. I have come to the conclusion that much of Plotinus' reputation as a bad writer is due to unfortunate but well-intended editorial decisions by Porphyry. Given that the Loeb edition presents Plotinus' writings in Porphyry's order, and that the Loeb edition is in multiple volumes, reading Plotinus this way does have a certain entertaining quality as well (first get volume IV, read a treatise, then get volume VI, read another, then get volume I, read another, and so on).<br />An important recommendation I would make for the reader is that he be properly prepared in his background reading. All of Aristotle and all of Plato would be ideal (as well as a worthwhile activity in its own right), but if the would-be reader of Plotinus finds that a little daunting and wants to get started sooner, there are a few works that he should make a particular effort to read: Plato's &quot;Phaedo&quot;, &quot;Republic&quot; (Books VI, VII), &quot;Parmenides&quot;, and &quot;Timaeus&quot;; Aristotle's &quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, &quot;On the Soul&quot;, and &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. Plato, as the earlier writer, should be read first (by the way - don't be discouraged when you find you don't understand the second half of &quot;Parmenides&quot;, Plotinus is going to tell you what he thinks it means in due course, so all you need to do is understand the references). If you don't have Plato or Aristotle, for Plato, Cooper's &quot;Plato: Complete Works&quot; (in one volume), and for Aristotle, Barnes' &quot;Complete Works of Aristotle&quot; (in two volumes), are excellent.	2001-07-24

It is not an easy thing to address these three disparate goals at the same time. The way Stevens does it is through his method of presentation.<br />The lowest-level building block around which Stevens structures his book is the individual function call. For each call (or minor variations on a single call), he provides the C prototype, and then, in text, explains what the function does, what it's arguments are for, and then provides a small C program that demonstrates it in action (all of the sample programs can also be downloaded from the web). These function-level building blocks are arranged into related sets, each of which is a chapter in the book. Each chapter has a wrapper that explains the basic concepts behind the functions in that chapter, and some review exercises at the end. The chapters in turn build on each other, with the most basic ones at the beginning and the more difficult ones towards the end.<br />The chapters do more, however, than just explain how the functions work, they also present different approaches to structuring socket programs. The basic problem in structuring a socket program is how to handle multiple connections. Choices include iterative vs. concurrent, multi-process vs. single-process, threaded vs. multiplexed. Stevens, in the process of teaching the reader the individual function calls, provides the reader with examples of all of these types of programs, along with a discussion of their relative strengths and weaknesses. I don't know if I can say enough in favor of Stevens' choice to include this material, or enough about the quality of his coverage of it.<br />Now some caveats. First, I have mixed feelings about the presentation of error handling. Stevens' coverage in the text is excellent, but the sample programs have a tendency to exit on error ratherthan demonstrate recovery. Also, the XTI coverage is thin; only about 120 pages of this 1,000 page book are about XTI. Finally, Stevens absolutely assumes that the reader knows how to program in C, knows general UNIX programming, and how to use Unix development tools (or at least has some other source from which to learn them). If you don't know C programming, you want to get Kernighan &amp; Ritchie's &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;. If you don't know about general UNIX programming, get Stevens' &quot;Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment&quot;.  If you don't know the tools, I know of many books, but unfortunately none that I would particularly recommend.<br />In closing, whatever the caveats, this is clearly a five-star programming book. If you need to write socket programs, it can save you untold amounts of grief. Writing network programs that are efficient, fast, and robust is far from trivial, and you can think of the thousand pages in this book as a thousand ways to avoid a thousand mistakes. While it expensive, it paid for itself for me in the first hour, and every hour since has been a dividend - if only all my investments had worked out this well...<br />---<br />Note - this book is listed as volume one of a two volume set, but for network programming, the first volume stands by itself quite well. The second volume is a grab-bag of material on pipes, message queues, mutexes, locks, semaphores, shared memory, and remote procedure calls. For network programming proper, the first volume is all you need.	2001-07-15

Solutions to Selected Exercises<br />Bibliography<br />Index<br />This is the third and least of Stevens' three books on UNIX programming (he also coauthored a multi-volume work on TCP). It is the not the least because it is necessarily the worst, but because it has the shortest and has the narrowest application domain.<br />Having said it is the least, it remains a work of the highest quality in an industry that is notable for the huge quantity of bad books that it produces. The structure of this book will be familiar to readers of his prior two books: the lowest-level building block around which Stevens structures the book is the individual function call. For each call (or minor variations on a single call), he provides the C prototype, and then, in text, explains what the function does, what it's arguments are for, and then provides a small C program that demonstrates it in action (all of the sample programs can also be downloaded from the web). These function-level building blocks are arranged into related sets, each of which is a chapter in the book. Each chapter has a wrapper that explains the basic concepts behind the functions in that chapter, and some review exercises at the end. The chapters in turn build on each other, with the most basic ones at the beginning and the more difficult ones towards the end.<br />In spite of the book's many positive qualities, one thing that this book brings to light, however, is that there is a thread-sized hole in Stevens' UNIX writings. &quot;Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment&quot; had a great deal of information about processes, but nothing about threads. &quot;UNIX Network Programming: Volume 1&quot;, discussed multi-threaded socket programs, but didn't go into any depth on threading. This volume, although it discusses thread synchronization, only touches on general threading issues. Thus, the works, taken as a group, go into some of the important issues and uses of threading without giving the reader a solid grounding in the subject. As threading increases in frequency, this deficiency has grown in importance.<br />Another difference between this book and its predecessors is that it deals with an area where standards are much weaker than the others; thus, the chapters often have to explain different implementations for accomplishing a task rather than building a basic-to-advanced sequence. This obviously is in no way Stevens' fault, but many readers will find that half the book, which is already the thinnest of Stevens' programming books, is concerned with API's which do not exist on their platform of interest.<br />To sum up, while this review clearly shows the reservations I have about this book compared to its predecessors, it must still be stressed that Stevens' is a technical author of the highest level. If you do have a need to understand any of the subjects in this book, you won't find a better teacher from which to learn it, and that is why I am still giving the book five stars.	2001-07-15

If you read Plato with solemn high-mindedness, you not only will enjoy him much less than you should (which is bad), you will misunderstand an awful lot of what he's saying (which is worse).<br />To start, let's consider an uncontroversial example in this short exchange from Euthyphro:<br />\\"SOCRATES: ...by Zeus, Euthyphro, you think your knowledge of the divine, and of piety and impiety, is so accurate that ... you have no fear of having acted impiously in bringing your father to trial?<br />\\"EUTHYPHRO: I should be of no use, Socrates, and Euthyphro would not be superior to the majority of men, if I did not have accurate knowledge of all such things.<br />\\"SOCRATES: It is indeed most important, my admirable Euthyphro, that I should become your pupil...\\"<br />Hopefully you at least smiled when you read it. If you didn't, try again, this time reading it aloud: Euthyphro is conceited, and Socrates is playing with him.<br />Assuming you're still with me, let's take a somewhat controversial example, from Meno:<br />\\"SOCRATES: ...shall we try to find out together what virtue is?<br />\\"MENO: Certainly. But Socrates, I should be most pleased to investigate and hear your answer to my original question [whether virtue can be taught]...<br />\\"SOCRATES: If I were directing you, Meno, and not only myself, we would not have investigated whether virtue is teachable or not before we had investigated what virtue itself is. But because you do not even attempt to rule yourself, in order that you may be free...we must, it appears, inquire into the qualities of something the nature of which we do not yet know...<br />\\"...<br />\\"SOCRATES: ...take Pericles, a man of such magnificent wisdom. You know that he brought up two sons...he educated them in the arts, in gymnastics, and in all else...but did he not want to make them good men? I think he did, but this could not be taught.<br />\\"...<br />\\"ANTYTUS: I think, Socrates, that you easily speak ill of people. I would advise you, if you will listen to me, to be careful...<br />\\"SOCRATES: I think, Meno, that Antytus is angry, and I am not at all surprised.\\"<br />Now, did Plato think that Pericles was wise? Glenn Morrow, the author of the fine (and very serious) \\"Plato's Cretan City\\" thought so: \\"in the Meno...the great statesmen...Pericles [and others]...are cited as examples of wisdom and civic virtue.\\"<br />Is Morrow right? There are certainly grounds to suspect otherwise. Pericles is declared a man of virtue, but given that the participants agree that they don't know what virtue is, this statement should be suspect. This suspicion should be reinforced by the anger of Antytus - why does he think Pericles is being spoken ill of if Socrates is serious? And why is Socrates not surprised at Antytus' anger? Now, let's consider another mention of Pericles, from \\"Gorgias\\":<br />\\"SOCRATES...Are the Athenians said to have become better because of Pericles, or quite the contrary, are they said to have been corrupted by him? That's what I hear anyhow, that Pericles made the Athenians idle and cowardly...<br />\\"CALLICLES: The people you hear say this have cauliflower ears, Socrates.<br />\\"SOCRATES: Here, though, is something I'm not just hearing. I do know clearly and you do, too, that at first Pericles had a good reputation...but after he had turned them into 'admirable and good' people, near the end of his life, they voted to convict Pericles of embezzlement...because they thought he was a wicked man, obviously.<br />\\"CALLICLES: Well? Did that make Pericles a bad man?<br />\\"SOCRATES: A man like that who cared for donkeys or horses or cattle would at least look bad if he showed these animals kicking, butting, and biting him because of their wildness, when they had been doing none of these things when he took them over...\\"<br />Both of the other two dialogues cited reinforce the reading that Socrates was having fun with Meno and Antytus just as he was having fun with Euthyphro, and that the praise of Pericles was anything but sincere.<br />For my third and final example of how important it is to know when Plato is being funny, I cite this passage from \\"Republic\\":<br />\\"SOCRATES: Don't you think that our future guardian, besides being spirited, must also by nature be philosophical?<br />\\"GLAUCON: How do you mean?<br />\\"SOCRATES: It's something you see in dogs, and it makes you wonder at the animal.<br />\\"GLAUCON: What?<br />\\"SOCRATES: When a dog sees someone it doesn't know, it gets angry before anything bad happens to it. But when it knows someone, it welcomes him, even if it has never received anything good from him...<br />\\"...<br />\\"SOCRATES: Surely this is...truly philosophical.<br />\\"GLAUCON: In what way philosophical?<br />\\"SOCRATES: Because it judges anything it sees to be either a friend or an enemy, on no other basis that it knows the one and doesn't know the other...\\"<br />So, does Socrates really think that dogs are philosophical, or is he having fun and really think that dogs are dumb as dirt? If he is having fun, what does that mean for the guardians? The comparison of the guardians to dogs is repeated many times in \\"Republic\\": if it is not a compliment, what does that mean in interpreting of Plato's political views?<br />In closing, while knowing when Plato is serious is surely necessary to understanding him, that doesn't mean that its always easy. One thing that help is cross-referencing the dialogues, which is one of the things that a fine collection like this makes possible.	2001-07-15

This material is supplemented by short introductions and synopses at the start of each chapter, and by abundant and detailed footnotes. The footnotes explain translation difficulties (not uncommon with Plotinus), and also identify the sources of Plotinus' references to other writers. These materials are excellent.<br />The only thing that this edition lacks is an index. The editors plead the difficulty of indexing Plotinus, and recommend &quot;Lexicon Plotinianum&quot; by J. H. Sleeman and Gilbert Pollet as an alternative. This work is, however, out of print (is it even in English? I am not sure) so it is not a very helpful suggestion. As it is, given Plotinus' rather scattered way of writing, an index is missed.<br />The Enneads are a collection of Plotinus' writings from fairly late in his life. Porphyry, his student, encouraged him in writing down his teachings, and acted as his posthumous editor (he also wrote a short biography of Plotinus which is included in the first volume). The works as they exist today are as they were received from Porphyry. As editor, Porphyry created his own organization for the works based on subject matter. This order is completely different from the order in which Plotinus wrote them. Porphyry, however, did document the original ordering.<br />From my own experience, however, I would recommend strongly reading Plotinus' writings in the order Plotinus wrote them rather than the order in which Porphyry arranged them. The major advantage I found was that it was much easier to follow the reasons why Plotinus believed what he did, even if the subject matter doesjump around a bit. I tried Porphyry's order first, and almost gave up in despair before trying again in Plotinus' order. I have come to the conclusion that much of Plotinus' reputation as a bad writer is due to unfortunate but well-intended editorial decisions by Porphyry. Given that the Loeb edition presents Plotinus' writings in Porphyry's order, and that the Loeb edition is in multiple volumes, reading Plotinus this way does have a certain entertaining quality as well (first get volume IV, read a treatise, then get volume VI, read another, then get volume I, read another, and so on).<br />An important recommendation I would make for the reader is that he be properly prepared in his background reading. All of Aristotle and all of Plato would be ideal (as well as a worthwhile activity in its own right), but if the would-be reader of Plotinus finds that a little daunting and wants to get started sooner, there are a few works that he should make a particular effort to read: Plato's &quot;Phaedo&quot;, &quot;Republic&quot; (Books VI, VII), &quot;Parmenides&quot;, and &quot;Timaeus&quot;; Aristotle's &quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, &quot;On the Soul&quot;, and &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. Plato, as the earlier writer, should be read first (by the way - don't be discouraged when you find you don't understand the second half of &quot;Parmenides&quot;, Plotinus is going to tell you what he thinks it means in due course, so all you need to do is understand the references). If you don't have Plato or Aristotle, for Plato, Cooper's &quot;Plato: Complete Works&quot; (in one volume), and for Aristotle, Barnes' &quot;Complete Works of Aristotle&quot; (in two volumes), are excellent.	2001-07-14
US	52674203	R3316CVMUU413	0813200598	856341873	059: Fathers of the Church: Saint Augustine : The Teacher, the Free Choice of the Will, Grace and Free Will (Fathers of the Church Series)	Books	5	17	17	N	N	More great stuff from Augustine	The table of contents of this collection is as follows:<br />The Teacher (Introduction by Russell)<br />The Free Choice of the Will (Introduction by Russell)<br />Retractions, Book 1, Chapter 9, concerning &quot;The Free Choice of the Will&quot;)<br />Grace and Free Will (Introduction by Russell)<br />General Index (Russell)<br />Index of Holy Scripture (Russell)<br />All of the works are translated by Robert P. Russell, who also wrote a short introduction to each, provided footnotes, and added the two indices. The introductions mostly serve to indicate when and for what purpose the work was written, generally based on Augustine's own comments in his &quot;Retractions&quot;, and also the historical significance of the work. Augustine seldom needs an interpreter, and interpretive commentary is therefore brief. The abundant footnotes concern translation issues, scripture references, other references (both to other authors' and Augustine's own works), and occasionally points of interpretation.<br />The first work in the collection &quot;The Teacher&quot;, which was written in the form of a dialogue between Augustine and his son Adeodatus, whose early death may have led to the dialogue's composition. The dialogue does have historical substance behind it, as it does reflect conversations that Augustine and his son actually had.<br />The subject of &quot;The Teacher&quot; is language, or more properly, signs. The structure of the argument begins with a discussion of words as signs, then moves to consider that words themselves can be the objects of signs, and that signs do not have to be words. Initially, the argument is that the purpose of signs is to teach, but by the end, the argument has moved to stress the active role of the listener in learning and (briefly) of God as the ultimate source of all knowledge. In character, the work is much more philosophical than scriptural.<br />The second work in the collection is &quot;The Free Choice of the Will&quot;, which like &quot;The Teacher&quot; was written in the form of a dialogue. Also like &quot;The Teacher&quot; it is much more philosophical than scriptural in character. The purpose of the work is to defend man's free will with regard to good and evil against the Manichaean view of man as a passive battlefield for the cosmic war between good and evil. The work got him into some trouble as it was later used as a support by Pelagius in his argument for the sufficiency of free will against the necessity of grace. Russell takes pains to document this by footnoting exactly what passages Pelagius cited. Augustine himself devoted space to this subject in his &quot;Retractions&quot; (that chapter is included in this collection) defending that he was not denying grace in this work and that his general position on grace and free will was coherent.<br />The third work in the collection is &quot;Grace and Free Will&quot;, which was written against Pelagius. It argues for the necessity of grace and denies the sufficiency of free will. The form of the work is heavily scriptural. Augustine seeks to demonstrate that the Pelagian position is incompatible with scripture, while at the same time taking pains to avoid erring in the opposite direction - that because grace is necessary, free will does not exist. While Augustine does present a positive account as to how grace and free will can be reconciled, I did not think he presented it nearly as clearly as he did in &quot;Admonition and Grace&quot; (as found in the collection &quot;Fathers of the Church: St. Augustine : Christian Instruction, Admonition and Grace, The Christian Combat, Faith, Hope, and Charity&quot;), a work that I admire enormously.<br />---<br />The collection as a whole is interesting in part because it showcases the variety of styles Augustine used in writing: dialogue vs. straight prose and philosophical vs. scriptural, and also because it shows Augustine as a defender of a complex position against oversimplifications in two different directions. Before I read Augustine, I admit that my eyes had glazed over at the thought of reading anything to do with &quot;Manichaeanism&quot; or &quot;Pelagianism&quot; - after all, why should I care about arguments against long-extinct sects? Well, the reason is that a good heresy never dies, it just changes its name and moves to a new address. Far from being a dusty exercise, I found Augustine's writings on these controversies to be very much of current interest and well worth anyone's time.	2001-06-01

The table of contents is as follows:<br />&quot;Christian Instruction&quot;, introduced and translated by John J. Gavigan<br />&quot;Admonition and Grace&quot;, introduced and translated by John Courtney Murray<br />&quot;The Christian Combat&quot;, introduced and translated by Robert P. Russell<br />&quot;Faith, Hope, and Charity&quot;, introduced and translated by Bernard M. Peebles<br />Index<br />The supplemental materials in this book consist of fairly short introductions to each work written by the translator of that work, footnotes that explain translation issues, references to other works, including scripture references, and finally, a shared index.<br />Each of the four works which comprise this book will be discussed in turn.<br />---<br />The title of the first work, &quot;Christian Instruction&quot;, leaves the reader to wonder whether the work is intended to instruct him in Christianity or to be an instructor of others in Christianity. The answer is: yes. To quote Augustine himself, in his discussion of it in his &quot;Retractions&quot;:<br />&quot;I...completed the work in four books. The first three of these help to an understanding of the Scriptures, while the fourth instructs us how to present the facts which we have just comprehended.&quot;<br />Of the &quot;books&quot; alluded to by Augustine, the first prescribes the proper attitude for the study of scriptures, specifically from the perspective of &quot;faith, hope, and charity&quot;. The second prescribes a program of education, central to which is knowledge of language: both the general knowledge of language as a system of signs, and specific knowledge of Hebrew and Greek. The third prescribes a system of hermeneutics or interpretive principals and rules. Finally, the fourth is essentially a discussion of rhetorical methods of persuasion and their application to teaching Christianity to others.<br />---<br />The second work,&quot;Admonition and Grace&quot;, was written because a number of monks had been disturbed by an a letter of Augustine which they thought so exalted the importance of divine grace as to leave no place for human free will (and responsibility). The specific question they asked was: <br />&quot;Why are we preached to, and given commands, in order to have us avoid evil and do good, if it is not we ourselves who do these things, but God who effects in us the will and the deed?&quot;<br />To the immediate question, Augustine in reply developed the doctrine that while man of his own free will could do no good without grace, he could recognize his own evil, and in that power lay his responsibility:<br />&quot;Whenever you fail to follow the known commands of God and are unwilling to be admonished, you are for this very reason to be admonished, that you are unwilling to be admonished...You are unwilling to have yourself shown to yourself, that you may see your own deformity, and seek one to reform you, and beg Him not to leave you in your ugliness of soul.&quot;<br />Not content with having answered the question at hand, Augustine went further, and discussed the ultimate origin of sin, and the state of man and the fallen angels before their respective falls and the nature of those falls. Going further yet, he discusses grace with regard to Mary and the elect, and still further, ultimately ending in a theodicy.<br />---<br />The third work, &quot;The Christian Combat&quot; is a short, muscular work &quot;written in a plain style for brethren not proficient in the Latin language&quot;. Its end is to lay out how a Christian should live, and to identify heresies that Christians should avoid falling into. As befitting its audience and purpose, it is simple and direct. The basics of Christian belief and scriptural justifications for them are quickly described, then then warnings are given a series of heresies that must be rejected.<br />The points of Christian belief covered are the nature of evil (Manichaean dualism being explicitly rejected), the governance of Providence, salvation through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and God as the Trinity.<br />The list of heresies to be rejected is actually the bulk of the work. Each begins with a &quot;Let us not heed...&quot; introduction, followed by a description of the particular heresy, and then a justification (generally scriptural, sometimes logical) for why it should be rejected.<br />---<br />&quot;Faith, Hope, and Charity&quot;, the fourth and final work in the book, is also known as the &quot;Enchiridion&quot;, or handbook. It was written in response to a letter containing a list of questions pertaining to Christian doctrine.<br />&quot;Faith, Hope, and Charity&quot; begins by discussing is a wide-ranging work, as its origin might suggest. Most of the work is loosely organized around the apostles' creed as a framework for explaning the faith. As such, it discusses belief in God, the goodness of creation, the nature of sin, the origin of sin, God's grace and Christ as the means of man's salvation, the church, the resurrection of the dead, the relation between providence and free will, hope and the Lord's prayer, and finally charity as the crowning principal of the commandments and the true good at which man should aim.<br />---<br />For my part, the work that really stood out was &quot;Grace and Admonition&quot;. The subtlety and power of Augustine's solutions to the problems of grace and free will make truly impressive reading. Several times, I went back to the beginning and started reading again - not because I didn't understand it, but because I was so floored by it, that I simply had to read it again right away.	2001-05-24

The brothers asked him questions on a wide variety of topics and saved his answers. Some time later, as Bishop of Hippo, Augustine caused the questions and answers to be collected together into a single book, though how much detailed editorial direction he provided is unclear.<br />Before discussing the original text, it is worthwhile to note David L. Mosher's contributions to this edition. First, and most obviously, he translated the work into English. His translation is liberally commented with footnotes, noting translation issues, scripture references, historical references to people, places, events and ideas, as well as clarifications and corrections indicated by Augustine himself in &quot;Retractions&quot;.<br />By way of introducing the book, Mosher wrote a preface that is really just a thank-you note to people who assisted him, a short bibliography mostly of general references on Augustine, a short list of abbreviations, and a fairly length introduction aimed at (1) describing the history and form of the work, and (2) doctrinal points. Finally, at the end of the book, Mosher provides two indices - an extensive general index and a scripture index.<br />In sum, Mosher's supplemental materials are excellent.<br />Insofar as the text proper goes, Augustine's individual answers vary in the length from less than half a page up to about ten pages, with most at the shorter end of the scale. The shorter answers tend to be philosophical in nature, with little or no explicit scriptural argumentation given. The longer answers tend to be concerned with scriptural exegesis, which Augustine typically approaches by seeking to uncover the symbolic meaning of the passage through close analysis.<br />With regard to subject matter, it is so diverse that it is difficult to tease out any unifying themes other than those that are the natural result of a single author. Certainly one gets to see Augustine apply his methods to a variety of individual cases and from them can infer how he generally thought and approached problems, but the cases tend to remain individual, rather than adding up to a cohesive whole. This is a shortcoming sufficient to have led me to consider grading this at four stars instead of five, but in the end, this is still a book that is read over 1500 years after it was written, and that makes downgrading it difficult even if it is not Augustine's best or most influential work.	2001-05-16

All of Aristotle and all of Plato would be ideal (as well as a worthwhile activity in its own right), but if the would-be reader of Plotinus finds that a little daunting and wants to get started sooner, there are still a few works that he should make a particular effort to read: Plato's &quot;Phaedo&quot;, &quot;Republic&quot; (Books VI, VII), &quot;Parmenides&quot;, and &quot;Timaeus&quot;; Aristotle's &quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, &quot;On the Soul&quot;, and &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. Plato, as the earlier writer, should be read first (by the way - don't be discouraged when you find you don't understand the second half of &quot;Parmenides&quot;, Plotinus is going to tell you what he thinks it means in due course, so all you need to do is understand the references). If you don't have Plato or Aristotle, for Plato, Cooper's &quot;Plato: Complete Works&quot; (in one volume), and for Aristotle, Barnes' &quot;Complete Works of Aristotle&quot; (in two volumes), are excellent.	2001-05-05

US	52674203	R1QNZAVBC414QC	069101650X	272933722	Complete Works of Aristotle, Vol. 1	Books	5	172	184	N	N	Reader's Guide	This review is a sort of reader's guide to &quot;The Complete Works&quot;. I've grouped Aristotle's works into logically related sets, provided a list of the works for each set (in the recommended reading order), and also indicated what sets are prior reading for which other sets. Note that I've restricted myself to those works of undoubted authenticity.<br />To use this review, locate the set containing a work you are interested in, read the sets that are logically prior to it, and then the prior works in that set.<br />Categories<br />&quot;Categories&quot; - Is it about words, ideas, or metaphysics? The answer is: yes! This is the most foundational of Aristotle's works. For almost anything of Aristotle's you plan to read, you should read this first.<br />Logic<br />&quot;De Interpretatione&quot;, &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;, &quot;Topics&quot;, &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot; - &quot;Categories&quot;is a prerequisite. &quot;De Interpretatione&quot; is about statements (and negations), &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; is about deductions, &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot; is about demonstrations, and &quot;Topics&quot; is about dialectical deduction (and proper formation of definitions). &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot; is really an appendix to &quot;Topics&quot; and deals with various logical fallacies. Mostly, they're not difficult reading, but &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; may have been the most numbing thing I've read in my whole life. The material about definitions in &quot;Topics&quot; has profound importance for Aristotle's metaphysics.<br />General Science<br />&quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, &quot;On Generation and Corruption&quot;, &quot;Meteorology&quot; - &quot;Categories&quot; is a prerequisite, and the Logic set is recommended prior reading. &quot;Physics&quot; concerns change - the words &quot;motion&quot;, &quot;movement&quot;, and so on are often used to indicate any kind of change, not just a changein location. &quot;On the Heavens&quot; concerns cosmology. &quot;On Generation and Corruption&quot; is broadly about chemistry. &quot;Meteorology&quot; is about atmospheric phenomena, but includes such things as comets and earthquakes. Aristotelian physics and cosmology, though pretty thoroughly wrong, have a coherence that goes far to account for their longevity. His equivalent to chemistry, on the other hand, is not only pretty thoroughly wrong, but wrong in ways that really, really make you wish that Aristotle had been willing to say &quot;I don't know&quot; a lot more often than he was.<br />Biology<br />&quot;On the Soul&quot;, &quot;Sense and Sensibilia&quot;, &quot;On Memory&quot;, &quot;On Sleep&quot;, &quot;On Dreams&quot;, &quot;On Divination in Sleep&quot;, &quot;On Length and Shortness of Life&quot;, &quot;On Youth, Old Age, Life and Death, and Respiration&quot;, &quot;Movement of Animals&quot; - &quot;Categories&quot; and the General Science set are prerequisites. &quot;Soul&quot; is a word with a great many associations with Christian belief that should be forgotten before reading this set of works; for Aristotle, in this context, &quot;soul&quot; in this context pretty much means the qualities of living things that differentiate them from non-living and he builds up from there. The titles of these are largely self-explanatory. The bad chemistry in &quot;On Generation and Corruption&quot; leads to even worse biology here.<br />Zoology<br />&quot;History of Animals&quot;, &quot;Parts of Animals&quot;, &quot;Progression of Animals&quot;, &quot;Generation of Animals&quot; - &quot;Categories&quot;, the General Science set, and the Biology set are prerequisites. Aristotle's writings on Zoology are a farrago of careful observation, folklore, and tall tales. Generally, when people want to make fun of Aristotle, they look in these works for quotes. I will resist the temptation to quote any of them here, and just point out that in Aristotle's time, the technical and social means for doing good work in this area just didn't exist.<br />Metaphysics<br />&quot;Metaphysics&quot; - &quot;Categories&quot;, the Logic set, and the General Science set are prerequisites, with the Biology set recommended, but not necessary. Although &quot;Metaphysics&quot; is famously difficult, you may not find it too hard if you have read the recommended prior works (particularly the material on definitions in &quot;Topics&quot;), and don't get too obsessed about trying to understand his attempts at refuting the views of philosophers whose works we no longer possess. Also, be aware that there are some confusing uses of the word &quot;soul&quot; as well that pretty clearly have a much broader meaning than those in the set on Biology.<br />Ethics<br />&quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;, &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; - No prerequisites. Both of these are lecture notes taken by students, whose names grace the titles of the works. The works are overlapping and don't have a real logical order. Of the two, Nicomachean Ethics is longer and covers more ground, and is therefore more commonly referenced than Eudemian Ethics, but the Eudemian Ethics flows better, and is the better one to read first. Some historical background reading about Greek society at this time is recommended. Perhaps surprisingly, after reading Aristotle's Ethics, his &quot;Rhetoric&quot; is highly recommended follow-up reading (the dark side of ethics, so to speak).<br />Politics<br />&quot;Constitution of Athens&quot;, &quot;Politics&quot; - The Ethics set is a prerequisite. &quot;Constitution of Athens&quot; is a political history of Athens. &quot;Politics&quot; is political theory. Reading &quot;Constitution of Athens&quot; before &quot;Politics&quot; can help provide context for the latter work, although additional historical background reading about Greece in Aristotle's time is highly recommended.<br />Rhetoric<br />&quot;Rhetoric&quot; - &quot;Categories&quot;, the Logic set, and the Ethics set are recommended prior reading. &quot;Rhetoric&quot; was a somewhat disreputable subject for Aristotle in that it aimed not at knowledge, but at persuasion, and by any means fair or foul. As part of this work, Aristotle expounds quite a bit on human nature, which makes this a fascinating follow-on to his works on Ethics.<br />Aesthetics<br />&quot;Poetics&quot; - No real prerequisites. This work, though short, has profoundly impacted aesthetic theory, particularly in the dramatic arts. Everyone should read this.	2001-04-29

This is one of those books. Before saying why it is a bad book, I will present the table of contents:<br />Preface<br />1. An Overview of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming<br />2. Native Types and Statements<br />3. Functions, Pointers, and Arrays<br />4. Classes<br />5. Constructors and Destructors<br />6. Operator Overloading and Conversion<br />7. Templates, Generic Programming, and STL<br />8. Inheritance<br />9. Exceptions<br />10. OOP Using C++<br />Appendices<br />A. ASCII Character Codes<br />B. Operator Precedence and Associativity<br />C. Language Guide<br />D. Input/Output<br />E. STL and String Libraries<br />References<br />Index<br />So, what makes this book bad?<br />First, there is the problem of confusion of purpose. The book's title proclaims that it is: &quot;C++ for C Programmers&quot;. From the title, the reader would expect that the book would assume that he knew C and would teach him C++. The first sentence of the Preface would support him in this idea: &quot;The book uses an evolutionary teaching process, with C as a starting point and C++ as a destination.&quot;<br />The first odd thing that the reader will notice is that each chapter includes a short section on Java. Why? There is no realistic hope of teaching the reader Java in so short a space; there is no reason to think that the reader wanted the book to teach him Java. The existence of these sections is a mystery.<br />The second odd thing that the reader will notice is that the book attempts to teach him C. Take for example, the following from the book<br />&quot;2.81 Assignment and Expressions<br />In C++, assignment occurs as part of an assignment expression, which can occur in several forms.<br />a = b + 1;<br />This expression evaluates the right-hand side of the assignment and converts it to a value compatible with the variable on the left-hand side...&quot;<br />Now the above is all very well, but if the reader already knows C, he is already aware of this - why explain it to him again? The author's instructions with regard to this question, from the start of the chapter, are curious: &quot;For the experienced C programmer, most of this chapter's material should be skimmed and read mainly with an eye for differences between C and C++. These differences will be listed in the chapter summary, which the experienced C programmer can use to determine what to selectively read about.&quot; Quite. If the reader takes the author's advice, he will skip to the chapter summary, and read a summary of the differences. An example of these is the following: &quot;In addition to implicit conversions, which can occur across assignments and in mixed expressions, there are explicit conversions called casts. New keywords introduced in C++ for casts are static_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast, and dynamic_cast.&quot; As can be seen, the summary does not tell the reader what he needs to know from the chapter, it instead tells him what he should try to go back and find in the chapter. The basic organizational model here is the scavenger hunt: the reader is given a list of things to find, and a locale in which those things are hidden; he is told to flip back and forth and scan until he has found (hopefully) the new material that the author has scattered through the old. The reader could be forgiven for thinking that the author was deliberately wasting his time.<br />The second problem with the book is that it isn't very informative. For example, take the matter of the casts that are in C++ but not C, which I used in the previous example. The full description in the chapter of the const_cast is as follows:<br />&quot;Two other special casts exist in C++: const_cast and dynamic cast...The const modifier means that a variable's value is nonmodifiable. Very occasionally, it is convenient to remove this restriction. Doing so is known as 'casting awayconstness' and is accomplished with the const_cast, as in:<br />foo(const_cast&lt;int&gt;(c_var));  // used to invoke foo<br />...&quot;<br />Now, a cast is a type conversion, so the example would be much clearer if the prototype for foo() and the type of c_var were provided. Sadly, the author has presented neither. Still, the reader might hope that the extensive language guide section in the back would clarify matters. So he checks it and reads the following:<br />&quot;Two other special casts exist in C++: const_cast and dynamic cast...The const modifier means that a variable's value is nonmodifiable. Very occasionally, it is convenient to remove this restriction. Doing so is known as 'casting away constness' and is accomplished with the const_cast, as in:<br />foo(const_cast&lt;int&gt;(c_var));  // used to invoke foo<br />...&quot;<br />The reader is almost certain to be disappointed at this point - the description in the main text and that in the language reference are word-for-word identical, right down to the same, meaningless example.<br />The only possible justification for the over-bare descriptions of the new features in the language is to keep the book short, but the book is padded three times over: it has material the reader doesn't want to know (Java), material the reader already knows (C), and material it has already presented (the main text/language guide reprint).<br />In the absence of justifiable reasons for why the book is the way it is, the reader is forced to assume unjustifiable reasons: that the author and the publisher either didn't know how to keep faith with the reader or that they didn't care to, or quite possibly both.constness' and is accomplished with the const_cast, as in:<br />foo(const_cast&lt;int&gt;(c_var));  // used to invoke foo<br />...&quot;<br />Now, a cast is a type conversion, so the example would be much clearer if the prototype for foo() and the type of c_var were provided.

US	52674203	R9P0DSG98Y545	0131103628	39144792	C Programming Language, 2nd Edition	Books	5	33	36	N	N	Accept no substitutes	Boy, does this book ever take me back. The first edition of this book was the first book about computers I had ever read. I had an Apple IIe, a C development environment (on 6 floppy disks, which had to be swapped in and out while building), and was trying to teach myself to program. I mostly understood what I was reading - until I got to the section about pointers, which I found incomprehensible. I just couldn't figure it out, until I was reading another book about the Apple II, which explained how the video system worked - then I got the idea that if I took a pointer and set it to video buffer, I could change what was displayed on the screen. Voila, it worked, and I was started on a profession that lasted to this day.<br />I still have that first edition, and years later, in 1988, when the second edition was published, I bought that. Well, there hasn't been a third edition, nor has one been needed. C is essentially a finished product. It does what it was made to do, which was to fill a role that didn't exist at the time of its creation, a language that could be used for both systems and applications programming. At that time assembly language was used for systems programming, and languages like COBOL, FORTRAN, or Pascal were used for applications programming. C could be used for both, and the rift between systems programming languages and applications programming languages was healed, at least until recently (applications programming has largely migrated to C++, while systems programming is still largely done in C).<br />If you want to do systems programming, you just need to learn C. But what if you want to do applications programming? Is it still worth your while to learn C? Well, yes. Here are some reasons why: First, C++ (and Java too, for that matter) are derived from C and are easier to learn once you know C - in fact, C++ is essentially a superset of C, to learn C++ you need to learn pretty much all of C anyway. Second, there are still a lot of C programs around, it is handy to be able to work on them should the need arise. Third, programming examples pretty much everywhere are routinely written in C. Fourth, C is just a neat language in its own right in which to write code; it is small and easy to learn, lends itself to small, fast code, and is available in almost every development environment.<br />So, if you are going to learn C, should you get this book?<br />For the first edition, the answer was easy because the book at that time not only taught people to program the language, it was the authoritative definition of the language - you would have been foolish to attempt to learn the language without it.<br />For this edition, that is not necessarily true - in fact, the book cover now refers to &quot;ANSI C&quot;, as ANSI has taken over defining the language standard, which the first edition of this book had formerly filled. In one sense, &quot;K &amp; R&quot;, as it has been known through the years, is now just another book about C. But in another sense, this book still is C - you can put the first edition and this one side by side (I have both before me now - the first edition is battered and worn, but otherwise very like the second), and be amazed at how similar the two are. Not many changes were made to the language definition between the two editions (all of them good ones), so there was little need to rewrite because of content changes. Most of the changes were for clarity - the chapter on pointers, which gave me so much trouble so many years ago, was the only one completely re-done for the second edition and is much the better for it.<br />So what does this book have that other C programming books do not? Authority. History. Community. The creator of the language wrote this book. For over two decades programmers have learned the language from this book. This is the book that you are more likely to share with other programers than any other. In sum, if you are interested in learning C programming, it should bean easy decision to go ahead and get this book.	2001-04-25

The computer industry is notable for the huge quantity of really bad books it engenders. This, however, is not one of those books - this is a great book. Before explaining why it is great, I'd like to get the table of contents out of the way, so that you will know what it covers:<br />Preface<br />1. Introduction (a &quot;whirlwind tour of Unix&quot;)<br />2. Unix Standardization and Implementations<br />3. File I/O<br />4. Files and Directories<br />5. Standard I/O Library<br />6. System Data Files and Information<br />7. The Environment of a Unix Process<br />8. Process Control<br />9. Process Relationships<br />10. Signals<br />11. Terminal I/O<br />12. Advanced I/O<br />13.

A Modem Dialer<br />19. Pseudo Terminals<br />Appendices<br />A. Function Prototypes<br />B. Miscellaneous Source Code (all source code is available for download)<br />C. Solutions to Selected Exercises<br />Bibliography<br />Index<br />The first thing to understand about the book is that while it can be used as just a reference work (the index is wonderful), it really is a book you can and should read. Even if you think you know a lot of this stuff, you can be surprised at what you can still learn.<br />What makes the book so much more useful than just a collection of man-page print-outs (that dreary and painfully common form of UNIX &quot;book&quot;) is the method of presentation. Stevens' basic atom of organization is the function call. For each call (or minor variations on a single call), he provides the C prototype, and then, in text, explains what the function does, what it's arguments are for, and then typically provides a small C program that demonstrates it in action, which he then explains. These function-level building blocks are arranged into related sets, each of which is a chapter in the book. Eachchapter has a wrapper that consists of an introduction explaining some basic concepts and history of the functions described in that chapter, and some review exercises at the end. The chapters themselves are arranged so that the earlier chapters describe the basic functions, and the later chapters describe the more difficult functions. Every chapter both teaches the reader something of immediate use in writing code (even the introduction has sample programs), as well as preparing him for the more difficult subjects that lie ahead.<br />Now for the caveats. Stevens absolutely assumes that you know how to program in C and that you know how to use Unix development tools (or at least that you have some other source from which to learn them). This is not the book to learn how to use C or particular shells, editors, compilers, linkers, or debuggers. Similarly, new Unix variants, such as Linux and MacOS X, receive no specific mention here at all (though the book is invaluable for both). Also, there is no discussion of the various GUI interfaces offered on many current Unix systems - for those, some other book will necessary.<br />One other thing worth mentioning is the cost of the book. Don't be put off by it - Stevens' book has been justifying that cost for a lot of readers for a lot of years.<br />In closing, I've been a developer for many years and have owned many computer books. I recommend very few of them, but can't recommend this one highly enough. It is one of the few books I've had that routinely lies open beside me when I work. In addition to my personal recommendation, you might look not only at all the positive reviews for this book, but also at the reviews for &quot;competitive&quot; books and notice how often they refer you back to this one. This book is the standard by which other UNIX programming books are measured, and so far, it has not been surpassed.	2001-04-24

The second volume is &quot;Epictetus : Discourses, Books 3 and 4 (Loeb Classical Library, No 218)&quot;. The contents for both volumes are as follows:<br />VOLUME I:<br />Introduction (editors)<br />Bibliography<br />Symbols<br />Discourses, Book I<br />Discourses, Book II<br />Index<br />VOLUME II:<br />Discourses, Book III<br />Discourses, Book IV<br />Fragments<br />Encheiridion<br />The first thing worth noting is that although the titles of the volume refer to just the Discourses, the set is really a complete set of extant works, including fragments from other sources as well as a complete copy of the Encheiridion.<br />As is typical for the Loeb classical library books, the volumes are physically small, and the original text (Greek, for Epictetus) is given on the left hand page, with the English translation on the right.<br />The Introduction gives a brief biography of Epictetus and background information concerning Stoic philosophy. The Bibliography (which contains an update note from the original 1925 edition) gives the state of Epictetus scholarship. In the actual texts, footnotes are abundant and explain unfamiliar names, places, difficulties with translation, uncertainties about the source text, and Epictetus' quotes from earlier writers are more fully referenced. In summation, the background material supplied with these books is excellent.<br />As for the texts themselves, they were not actually written by Epictetus, but were notes taken by Arrian, one of his students (not unlike the Nicomachean Ethics, which were notes taken by a student of Aristotle). The Discourses are quite lively in style; Epictetus' personality and teaching style comes through vividly. This is not true of the Encheiridion, which Arrian abstracted from the Discourses and which had the life wrung out of it in the process.<br />The Discourses are not a well-organized body of work, as their origin might suggest. They are repetitive, and points that should have been grouped together logically are dispersed throughout.<br />The content is almost entirely ethical. Epictetus emphasizes the spark of divinity within man - that a man should always behave honourably. External things, such as wealth and power, are not things to be valued - they can be lost at any time, and are not worth a man's honour. Because his teachings are ethical, Epictetus is not concerned with what a man knows, but how he lives. The point isn't to understand his philosophy (which isn't hard), but to live it (which is).	2001-02-22

That said, the books are handsome and will grace your library.<br />This is a reprint of a 1794 book. As was common at that time, an older form of the letter &quot;s&quot; was used for some word positions, which looks rather like a modern &quot;f&quot;. This can take some getting used to. The first sentence of &quot;Human Understanding&quot;, for example, looks rather like this: &quot;SINCE it is the underftanding, that fets man above the reft of fenfible beings, and gives him all the advantage and dominion which he has over them; it is certainly a fubject, even for its noblenefs, worth our labour to inquire into.&quot;<br />There is little in the way of editorial commentary. What there is is noted in the table of contents. The editors did put together indices, generally one per volume (the exception is volume I, which has the first part of the Essay concerning Human Understanding, the index for the entirety of which is in volume II).<br />Strange as it may seem, there is no collected works for Locke more recent than 1794. If a collected works is what you want, you can get this, or wait and hope that someday modern scholars will come up with something.	2001-02-22

(Loeb Classical Library No. 218)	Books	5	43	44	N	N	Not just the works	This is volume two of a two volume set. The first volume is &quot;Epictetus : Discourses, Books 1 and 2 (Loeb Classical Library, No 131)&quot;. The contents for both volumes are as follows:<br />VOLUME I:<br />Introduction (editors)<br />Bibliography<br />Symbols<br />Discourses, Book I<br />Discourses, Book II<br />Index<br />VOLUME II:<br />Discourses, Book III<br />Discourses, Book IV<br />Fragments<br />Encheiridion<br />Index<br />The first thing worth noting is that although the titles of the volume refer to just the Discourses, the set is really a complete set of extant works, including fragments from other sources as well as a complete copy of the Encheiridion.<br />As is typical for the Loeb classical library books, the volumes are physically small, and the original text (Greek, for Epictetus) is given on the left hand page, with the English translation on the right.<br />The Introduction gives a brief biography of Epictetus and background information concerning Stoic philosophy. The Bibliography (which contains an update note from the original 1925 edition) gives the state of Epictetus scholarship. In the actual texts, footnotes are abundant and explain unfamiliar names, places, difficulties with translation, uncertainties about the source text, and Epictetus' quotes from earlier writers are more fully referenced. In summation, the background material supplied with these books is excellent.<br />As for the texts themselves, they were not actually written by Epictetus, but were notes taken by Arrian, one of his students (not unlike the Nicomachean Ethics, which were notes taken by a student of Aristotle). The Discourses are quite lively in style; Epictetus' personality and teaching style comes through vividly. This is not true of the Encheiridion, which Arrian abstracted from the Discourses and which had the life wrung out of it in the process.<br />The Discourses are not a well-organized body of work, as their origin might suggest. They are repetitive, andpoints that should have been grouped together logically are dispersed throughout.<br />The content is almost entirely ethical. Epictetus emphasizes the spark of divinity within man - that a man should always behave honourably. External things, such as wealth and power, are not things to be valued - they can be lost at any time, and are not worth a man's honour. Because his teachings are ethical, Epictetus is not concerned with what a man knows, but how he lives. The point isn't to understand his philosophy (which isn't hard), but to live it (which is).	2001-02-22

The only significant content that is not Hume's own writing is in Volume I: the letter from Adam Smith describing Hume's death, and the material on the Hume - Rousseau controversy, which largely consists of the correspondence between the two men.<br />The essays in Volume III are from a 2-volume set published by Hume (together in one volume here) entitled &quot;Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary&quot;. I included the titles of the individual essays because I thought they would be of interest. All but the last two additional essays at the end of Volume IV were in some editions of &quot;Essays...&quot;, but not the 1777 edition which was used as the source for this collection.<br />Hume is of course one of the most important philosophers in history.

The translations in this collection are more modern, the introductions are smarter (if not longer), the footnotes identifying people, places and events more numerous, and many more of the works of uncertain authenticity are included, which have historical significance if nothing else.<br />With regard to the introductions to the individual dialogues in this collection, don't get too excited. They are short (typically a page), sometimes prone to hasty conclusions about deep questions, and generally don't tell you much that a quick read of the dialogue wouldn't. Summarizing Plato is in any case a hopeless enterprise. The dialogues are literary as well as philosophical works. They have multiple layers of meaning, and different interpretive perspectives can give very different readings on many passages.<br />To Cooper's credit, he notes the diversity of ways in which Plato is read in his introduction to the collection as a whole, and does what he reasonably can to caution the reader against over-quick and superficial pronouncements on each dialogue's meaning.<br />Where this collection, in comparison to the Hamilton collection, gets dinged is for its index.<br />Here, for example, is the index entry for &quot;habit&quot; from this collection:<br />habit: L. 2.655e, 4.708c, 7.792e, 7.794e; R. 7.518e, 10.619c.<br />And here is the entry from the Hamilton collection:<br />habit: in education of infants, Laws 7.792e, force of, ib. 4.708c; and nature, ib. 7.794e; and temperament, ib. 2.655e; and virtue, Rep. 7.518e, 10.619c<br />Still, unless you have some pressing need to get the Hamilton collection (such as a class assignment, or its use as a reference by some other work you're reading), this is the one to get. Of course, if you feel really distressed about the Cooper index, or just want a second translation for comparison, you could always get both.	2001-01-12

Is that all that Moses, Isaiah, Paul, Augustine, Aquinas, and Martin Luther, to name only a few, had to say on the subject?<br />Here is another:<br />&quot;Socrates makes a distinction fundamental in reasoning and often disregarded, that the good is good not because the gods approve it, but the gods approve it because it is good.&quot;<br />There is several hundred years of intense philosophical and theological debate (still continuing) settled in a pretty summary fashion.<br />Finally, there is this:<br />&quot;The real interest of the dialogue, however, is the picture of Socrates just before his trial...keenly involved in a discussion completely removed from his own situation.&quot;<br />One of the charges against Socrates was of course impiety. Also, I guess, it is ridiculous to assume that there is much inherent interest or significance in asking questions about the metaphysical grounding of the good, especially by comparison with Hamilton's fascinating &quot;People&quot; magazine approach to philosophy.<br />In one sense, the introductions do, however, perfectly introduce Plato. The multiple layers of stupidity in the introductions make a striking contrast with the multiple layers of insight in the dialogues themselves. When the reader goes from Hamilton to Plato, it is wonderfully pleasurable to feel the effect of the author's IQ jumping about 200 points.<br />As others have noted, if you have a free choice, &quot;Plato: Complete Works&quot;, edited by John M. Cooper is the Plato collection to get. The translations are more modern, the introductions are smarter (if not longer), the footnotes identifying people, places and events more numerous, and many more of the works of uncertain authenticity are included, which have historical significance if nothing else.<br />If you do have to buy this collection for school or because it is used as a reference by some other work you're reading, don't despair. You're still getting Plato. Also, you're getting the better index.<br />Here, for example, is the index entry for &quot;habit&quot; from this collection:<br />habit: in education of infants, Laws 7.792e, force of, ib. 4.708c; and nature, ib. 7.794e; and temperament, ib. 2.655e; and virtue, Rep. 7.518e, 10.619c<br />And here is the entry from the Cooper collection:<br />habit: L. 2.655e, 4.708c, 7.792e, 7.794e; R. 7.518e, 10.619c.	2001-01-12

With this collection, not only do you get all the works by Aristotle that are by Aristotle, you also get the works by Aristotle that are not by Aristotle. What more can you ask?<br />As a scan of the table of contents should reveal, you really need both volume 1 and 2. They are intended to be together - the chapters are not organized so as to make either readily dispensable. To underline the point, only Volume 2 has an index, and it's for both volumes.<br />The notes are dead minimal, and the translation from the Greek can often result in some odd sounding passages, the meaning of which the reader has to guess. An example is the very first sentence of the very first chapter, &quot;Categories&quot;:<br />&quot;When things have only a name in common and the definition of being which corresponds to the name is different, they are called homonymous. Thus, for example, both a man and a picture are animals.&quot;<br />I infer that in Greek, the example is clear, although in English it is nonsensical - there was no translator's note, so my inference is all I have.<br />Grumbling about notes aside, it is great that this collection exists. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in philosophy.<br />Once again, don't forget to get both volumes.	2000-12-01
US	52674203	RQI5HTOHBA544	0140048979	773818200	The Face of Battle: A Study of Agincourt, Waterloo, and the Somme	Books	5	122	128	N	N	Arguably the best military history ever written.	The special genius of Keegan is his ability to evoke the human side of war. This comes from his understanding of the martial factors involved, an empathy for the participants, and a fine prose style that allows him to really reach the reader.<br />In &quot;The Face of Battle&quot;, Keegan employs these formidable talents to describe the battles of Agincourt (October 25, 1415), Waterloo (June 18, 1815), and the Somme (July 1, 1916) in three chapters. Before these is a chapter on battle in military history, and after them a conclusion regarding the future of battle.<br />The first chapter is devoted to the history of battle in history.  Keegan describes and cites examples of what he calls &quot;the battle piece&quot;, a form which he traces back to Julius Caesar, an example of whose writing he cites as containing the key flaws of its type:<br />&quot;Here it all is-DISJUNCTIVE MOVEMENT: 1. the Legion is hard pressed, some of the soldiers are slinking away; 2. Caesar arrives and has the standards advanced; 3. the enemy's attack loses its impetus; UNIFORMITY OF BEHAVIOUR: the enemy are all attacking, the legionaries are either resisting feebly or drifting off until Caesar's arrival makes them all fight with fervor; SIMPLIFIED CHARACTERIZATION: only two people are mentioned by name, of whom only one is accorded an important role - the author; SIMPLIFIED MOTIVATION: the led have lost the will to fight until the leader restores it to them by some simple orders and words of encouragement.&quot;<br />The above paragraph is the key to appreciating what Keegan is doing in his battle descriptions in &quot;The Face of Battle&quot;. The flaws are the result of points of view, the choice of either a &quot;ten-thousand foot view&quot; of masses of men maneuvering around the ground, or a &quot;leader's view&quot; in which all events are the result of the leader's actions. Keegan therefore attempts to correct the flaws by writing history that is a composite of multiple points of view.<br />For each battle Keegan begins with descriptions of the historical background, the battlefield, and the general course of the battle. These, however, are only the set-up; the core is the battle from the perspectives of the participants. To this end, Keegan identifies categories of combat - generally based on the combinations between different arms - infantry vs. cavalry, infantry vs. artillery, etc. and then seeks to understand the ranges of the experience of each. Finally, Keegan considers the prisoners and the wounded (perspectives tending to vanish as statistics in the &quot;battle piece&quot;), and always the general question of motivation.<br />Keegan's first battle is Agincourt. In it, English knights and archers defeated an army of French knights. Any historian is at a disadvantage in dealing with older subjects like Agincourt - primary source material (eye-witness and participant description) is scarce, and what there is is of uncertain reliability. These are formidable handicaps, but Keegan does an outstanding job of assembling what we know of the participants' material circumstances and social backgrounds to create a credible picture of what it must have been like. The point of view presented are those of the archers, the English and French knights on foot, the French mounted knights, as well as the prisoners, their captors, and the wounded.<br />Keegan's next battle is Waterloo. The historian's task here is different than at Agincourt. For Agincourt, there is a poverty of primary source material, but for Waterloo, there is an abundance. Here, Keegan is generally able to let the participants speak for themselves, and is able to focus more on attempting to explain why they had the experiences they had, and less on trying to imagine those experiences. The points of view are the combinations of the three arms - infantry, cavalry, and artillery, as well as the wounded and prisoners.<br />Keegan's final battle is the Somme. The categories of experience had been multiplied by technological change between Agincourt and Waterloo, but the effect of technology by the Somme had been reduction: the two primary experiences were both infantry-as-target, either as a target of artillery or as a target of machine guns. The horror of First World War combat has often been evoked, so Keegan's role as historian is less to introduce it to the reader than it is to integrate it with an understanding of why it was so, and how this experience made up the battle as a whole.<br />All of Keegan's battle narratives attempt to understand motivation - to answer the question &quot;Why did anyone fight and risk death?&quot; To do this, he draws on social, political, and economic considerations, as well as the more immediate circumstances of the battlefield itself. Although answering this is one of the key goals that Keegan sets for himself, I didn't feel that in this he was fully successful. It is a difficult problem, but I think he tends to underestimate the role of duty. I think he is perhaps too influenced by a desire to attempt to justify all actions in one form or another of self-interest, and in this he underestimates a key part of human nature - the desire of a man to do what he thinks is right.<br />The last chapter of Keegan's book concerns the future of battle. In it, Keegan is far to influenced by his understandable hopes that something as awful as battle will go away and indulges in bad analysis to support those wishes.<br />The flawed last chapter aside, &quot;The Face of Battle&quot; is one of the finest military histories ever written. It is one of the very few military history books I have read (and I have read many) that really changed my sense of not only what battle is, but what history is and can be. I have re-read it often, and when I was in school, used it as a model for the history papers that I wrote. If you read only one book of military history, read this one.	2000-11-29

There are three primary reasons for this:<br />First, it is unfinished. The first chapter (&quot;book&quot; as Clausewitz called it) is sharp, well-organized and focused, other chapters are so-so, and still others are almost formless collections of notes.<br />Second, Clausewitz is thinking philosophically. Most people, including many or most in his target audience, are unaccustomed to thinking this way, and find it difficult to re-orient themselves.<br />Third, parts of it are firmly locked in a particular time and place. The reader must work to determine what (if any) lessons in those parts are of enduring value and must understand references that, however clear they would have been to his contemporaries, are today obscure.<br />So, given all of the above, it is fair for the reader to ask why he should bother. The reason is the power of Clausewitz's answers to:<br />(1) What is the nature of war itself?<br />(2) What is war's relation to the larger world in which it exists?<br />(3) How can success in war be achieved?<br />Clausewitz's answer to question (1) is that war in itself is a duel on a large scale, which unless acted on from the outside, tends towards the maximum possible amount of violence. This discussion of &quot;pure war&quot; has probably been responsible for more mis-interpretations of Clausewitz than anything else he wrote. He is writing philosophically - trying to understand the nature of the thing, and some readers mis-read him as writing prescriptively - that because &quot;pure war&quot; (or &quot;ideal war&quot;) tends towards maximum violence, that those conducting war should employ maximum violence.<br />Clausewitz's answer to question (2) is one of the major reasons why &quot;pure war&quot; doesn't, can't, and shouldn't exist in the real world. First, real war occurs over time - not as a single event but as a series of events. This provides the opportunity for other forces to act upon it. The most important outside force acting upon it is political - war it is only a means - and the end is the political purposes which the war serves. The means cannot and must not trump the end. This is his famous dictum &quot;War is a continuation of policy by other means&quot;. The level of effort is conditioned by the end which the war serves as well as all the other ends the state is pursuing which may or may not be compatible with the war.<br />It is in his answer to (3), how success in war can be achieved, that Clausewitz is at his most period-bound. He draws heavily from examples that would have been as familiar to his contemporaries as the Gulf War is to us, but time has rendered them often obscure. Further, many of his recommendations are completely tied to how war was conducted on land in the early 19th century. Those who say that they got little out of Clausewitz are often referring to this subject area.* There is quite a bit of value here, but it is obtained at effort - the reader must back up to the principals that govern Clausewitz's thinking, and re-apply them to the current technical means. Because of this, there is the irony that Clausewitz would have contributed much more here if he had written much less. Of course, he might have done so if he had finished his manuscript, but on this we can only guess.<br />It is in the sum of (1), (2) and (3) that the value of Clausewitz is felt. The reader who makes the effort will find that he has acquired a systematic approach for thinking about war, a unified framework that includes the public policy perspective of when, whether, and how to employ it, as well as the military perspective of how to fight it.<br />---<br />* For at least topic (3), ideally the modern reader should have read at least short military histories of the Seven Years War (in Europe - not North America) as well as the Napoleonic Wars, as these two conflicts dominate Clausewitz's references. What you want to know is the names of the major battles, the sides, and the outcomes. Maps are invaluable.<br />Having a somewhat more in-depth reference handy can also be beneficial, though not necessary. If I had to recommend in-depth references, I would suggest, for the Napoleonic Wars, David Chandler's &quot;The Campaigns of Napoleon&quot; or Esposito and Elting's &quot;A Military History and Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars&quot;. Both are readily available and well worth having. For the Seven Years War, I don't know of anything that is good and in-print, although Christopher Duffy's &quot;The Military Life of Frederick the Great&quot; is just what you want if you can find a copy.	2000-11-20

This is an expensive item, and it obviously is not for everyone. That said, it is a valuable work and should be considered an adjunct to Fraser's &quot;Works of George Berkeley.&quot; In Jesseph's book, he presents two of Berkeley's essays - &quot;De Motu&quot;, and &quot;The Analyst&quot;, to which he provides extensive introductions and references. Both essays (and Jesseph's supporting material) will be reviewed in turn.<br />&quot;De Motu&quot; (On Motion) was originally written in Latin. Jesseph's first service is that he provides an English translation along with the Latin version. In this essay, Berkeley described and critiqued then-contemporary theories on the nature of motion. Jesseph does the reader a great service by introducing 17th century physics to the reader, explaining terms, and tracking down Berkeley's references.<br />What makes &quot;De Motu&quot; something other than a period piece is Berkeley's methodology. In  &quot;A Treatise Concerning the Principals of Human Knowledge&quot;, Berkeley laid out an argument against terms denoting entities which could not be experienced or imagined. An example of such a thing was Newton's absolute space. In &quot;De Motu&quot;, Berkeley wrote:<br />&quot;And so let us imagine that all bodies have been destroyed and reduced to nothing. What remains they call absolute space, all relation which arose from the position and distances of bodies having been removed along with the bodies themselves. Now this space is infinite, immobile, indivisible, insensible, without relation and without distinction. That is, all of its attributes are privative and negative: it seems therefore to be merely nothing. ... Therefore let us take from absolute space just the words, and nothing will remain in the sense, imagination, or intellect; therefore they designate nothing, except pure privation or negation, that is, merely nothing.&quot;<br />While Berkeley granted that such terms could be useful in calculation, he argued that they led only to meaningless wrangling when imagined as real. He held up a difference between Newton and Torricelli on force as an example:<br />&quot;Newton says that impressed force consists solely in action, and it is the action exerted on a body to change its state, nor does it remain after the action. Torricelli contends that a certain accumulation or aggregate of impressed forces is received by percussion in a mobile body, and that the same remains and constitutes impetus. ... And in truth, though Newton and Torricelli seem to disagree, nevertheless, each advances a consistent account, and the matter is adequately explained by both. For all forces attributed to bodies are ... mathematical hypotheses. Mathematical entities, however, have no stable essence in the nature of things: they depend on the notion of the definer: whence the same thing can be explained in different ways.&quot;<br />In sum, &quot;De Motu&quot; is valuable both as a general critique of science and as a fascinating application of Berkeley's epistimological ideas and is well worth reading on that basis.<br />The other Berkeley essay Jesseph covers is &quot;The Analyst&quot;. This essay attacked the soundness of the mathematical foundations of Newton's calculus. Because Newton's notation, method, and terminology are no longer in use, the essay is difficult for the modern reader to follow. Jesseph's introduction to &quot;The Analyst&quot; is a fine piece of scholarship and immensely helpful, even necessary, to full understanding of Berkeley's essay.<br />&quot;The Analyst&quot; was motivated by apologetic purposes. Berkeley was annoyed at the contrast set up by &quot;free thinkers&quot; between religious belief and math and the sciences, and he sought to demonstrate that mathematics has its mysteries as much as religion. His target was Newton's calculus: in particular, fluxions. Fluxions were infinitesimal quantities, which Berkeley attacked as being literally inconceivable, following his general principals of meaning, and further that Newton did not handle them consistently - sometimes rounding them to zero, and other times not, with the only criterion being whichever was necessary to make the answers come out right.<br />&quot;The Analyst&quot; set off a firestorm among mathemeticians. Berkeley's acid style led to angry responses, but the mathematical problems Berkeley had attacked were real, and the defenders of Newton offered very different (and incompatible) approaches to resolving the problems Berkeley had raised, and they soon began attacking each other. It was only in the nineteeth century that the problems surrounding the foundations of Calculus were finally settled.<br />Certainly, &quot;The Analyst&quot; is of interest as a part of the history of mathematics, but it is also of interest as an application of Berkeley's general approach. The paragraph below on infinitesmals, for example, clearly follows the same approach as that on absolute space quoted previously:<br />&quot;Now to conceive a Quantity infinitely small, that is, infinitely less than any sensible or imaginable Quantity, or than the least finite Magnitude, is, I confess, above my Capacity. But to conceive a Part of such infinitely small Quantity, that shall be infinitely less than it, and consequently though multiply'd infinitely shall never equal the minutest finite Quantity, is, I suspect, an infinite Difficulty to any man whatsoever...Nothing is easier to devise Expressions or Notations, for Fluxions and Infinitesimals of the first, second, third, fourth and subsequent Orders, proceeding in the same regular form without end or limit ... dx, ddx, dddx, ddddx, &amp;c. These Expressions indeed are clear and distinct, and the Mind finds no difficulty in conceiving them to be continued beyond any assignable Bounds. But if we remove the Veil and look underneath, if laying aside the Expressions we set ourselves attentively to consider the things themselves, which are supposed to be expressedor marked thereby, we shall discover much Emptiness, Darkness, and Confusion...&quot;<br />The last thing worth noting about &quot;The Analyst&quot; is that Berkeley wrote two follow-on essays in response to Newton's defenders, both of which are available in Fraser's &quot;Works&quot;.	2000-11-11
US	52674203	R1PTMC6SWVB3QF	0192817795	30170986	Confessions	Books	5	44	53	N	N	Written for Forever	There are three classes of support for Christian belief: the metaphysical, the historical, and the experiential. The metaphysical argues from logic and the existence and nature of reality, the historical from the past - both human and pre-human, and the experiential from personal, and private, experience.<br />While I don't want to diminish the metaphysical or historical components of Christian belief and apologetics, I think that the most important source of living belief is the experiential, but it is also by far the hardest to communicate, since it is by nature, private and personal. While my experiences may convince me of the truth of the Christian faith, how can they convince you? They are part of my experience, not yours. It might seem to be an impossibility, yet this is the challenge that Augustine took on in &quot;Confessions&quot;, and it is by the degree of difficulty that the extent of his success and the greatness of the work can be measured.<br />&quot;Confessions&quot; is a work of great beauty. Written in the form of a confessional prayer, Augustine bares himself utterly, and in so doing, makes the reader want to lower his defenses as well, making it possible to experience another's life more deeply than he might have thought possible, and in so doing, to translate his experience of Christianity across the divide that separates us from each other.<br />Because of the nature of &quot;Confessions&quot;, I think that analysis of it is to be avoided. Analysis is distancing - it encourages the reader not to dive it in, but to stand back. You cannot experience &quot;Confessions&quot; and critique it at the same time, and all of the value is in the experience.	2000-11-11
US	52674203	R1HP82X0MHUOOE	1855063352	233999429	The Works of George Berkeley (Major works)	Books	5	10	10	N	N	It's all of Berkeley - what more can you ask?	Since Berkeley is best remembered as a philosopher and it is therefore highly likely that anyone interested in this is interested in that part of Berkeley's collected works, that is where I will focus this review.<br />The most important work of Berkeley is &quot;A Treatise Concerning the Principals of Human Knowledge [Part I]&quot; (there is no part II - the partial manuscript for it was lost while Berkeley was travelling). &quot;Principals&quot; has two principal sections: one epistemological and the other metaphysical.<br />In the epistemological section of &quot;Principals&quot;, Berkeley argued that when we use words to describe entities which we literally cannot imagine, we block our own understanding - &quot;that we have first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see.&quot; We can use words to stand for a multiplicity of different entities (such as &quot;triangle&quot; to stand for all possible triangles), but that an abstract triangle, one that is &quot;neither oblique nor rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon, but all and none of these at once&quot;, (here he was quoting Locke) is an impossibility. The significance of this is subtle, but critical to his argument since he came back to it again and again throughout his works to differentiate between meaningful and meaningless words.<br />Having laid out a differentiation between meaningful and meaningless words in his epistemological section, Berkeley then proceeded to the metaphysical section, in which he attacked the idea of matter, principally as expounded by Locke. Berkeley argued that matter is a meaningless word, signifying nothing that we can imagine. He argued that all of the properties that materialists ascribe to matter are either perceptions (non-existent in the absence of a perceiver) or utterly meaningless. Thus, Berkeley argued that a theory of matter to account for our perceptions was a meaningless proposition. Our perceptions of the world (our ideas of it), however, still required an explanation. To this end, Berkeley argued the things we perceive are ideas that are put into our minds by God. They differ from things that we imagine by our lack of control over them, and in their consistency and vividness - properties that are the result of their being the product of a mind other than and vastly more powerful than our own. In this argument, Berkeley felt that he had discovered a powerful counter to atheism, that his theistic idealism could account for the world whereas atheism, with its dependency on matter, could not.<br />&quot;Principals&quot; did not meet with the acceptance that Berkeley had hoped for it (to say the least), so he presented his metaphysics again in a more accessible form in &quot;Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous.&quot; &quot;Dialogs&quot; is easier to read, but not as good a source as &quot;Principals&quot; for really understanding Berkeley. In either form, the critical side of his argument against matter had and has great force, even if his proposed alternative has never attracted many adherents.<br />Berkeley also presented his metaphysics again in less detail in two other works: the fourth dialogue in &quot;Alciphron; or, the Minute Philosopher&quot; and in &quot;The Theory of Vision, or Visual Language, Shewing the Immediate Presence and Providence of a Deity.&quot;<br />&quot;Commonplace Book - Berkeley's notes from 1705-08.&quot; is a collection of short notes that Berkeley jotted down while he was working through his philosophical ideas and preparing to publish them. &quot;Commonplace Book&quot; itself was never intended for publication but is of interest in understanding how Berkeley's thought developed.<br />Berkeley also wrote on scientific matters, consistent with his views as laid out in &quot;Principals&quot;, on vision in &quot;An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision&quot;, (which he actually wrote before &quot;Principals&quot; which he hoped would soften the audience for the presentation of the full theory in &quot;Principals&quot; and also in &quot;De Motu&quot; (On Motion).<br />Berkeley also wrote on mathematics, again consistently with his philosophical writings in &quot;The Analyst; or a Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician&quot; and the follow-on works &quot;A Defense of Free-Thinking in Mathematics&quot; and &quot;Reasons for not Replying to Mr. Walton's Full Answer&quot;. &quot;The Analyst&quot; - an attack on the foundations of Newton's calculus, set off a furor in British mathematics that lasted a century.<br />&quot;Alciphron&quot; alluded to earlier, was a work of Christian apologetics, and was Berkeley's longest work. It is not without interest today, but it has not aged as well as his other works mentioned above.<br />&quot;Passive Obedience: or The Christian Doctrine of not resisting the Supreme Power&quot;, was a work of political philosophy. It is not at all connected with his other philosophical works and was regarded as dangerous and somewhat subversive.<br />The last work of Berkeley that deserves individual mention is &quot;Siris: A Chain of Philosophical Reflexions and Inquiries Concerning the Virtues of Tar-Water and Divers Other Subjects Connected Together and Rising From One Another&quot;, a curious (to put it mildly) work on both &quot;tar-water&quot;, which Berkeley held to be a panacea, and metaphysical speculation inspired by reading classical sources (if you don't know what tar-water is, don't worry - you can get the recipe in &quot;Siris&quot;). &quot;Siris&quot; was written near the end of Berkeley's life. The metaphysical speculation in it did not constitute an abandonment of his earlier ideas, but it did not strike me as at all developed - he was going somewhere new but had not yet arrived when he wrote it.<br />Apart from his intellectual endeavors above, Berkeley also led a full life and was an active Anglican clergyman. He travelled, wrote on purely religious matters, and also wrote in support of social justice and tolerance. These works round out the man, as does &quot;Life of Berkeley&quot;, Fraser's biographical essay at the start of the collection.<br />The collection is not without its flaws. Chief among these is that &quot;De Motu&quot; is left in Latin and untranslated both it and &quot;The Analyst&quot; really require more extensive introductions to be easily understood by a contemporary reader. Douglas Jesseph's &quot;De Motu and The Analyst&quot;, Volume 41 of &quot;The New Syntheses Historical Library&quot; is a highly recommended supplement to the &quot;Works&quot;.	2000-11-09

Gil is very impressed with himself, as this from page 1 will show:<br />&quot;Apple seemed a natural, considering my background as a Ph.D.  technologist with a number of patents and my reputation as a business  leader who had established a notable record for transforming ailing  companies.&quot;<br />Whether this confidence was justified can be discerned  in many places in the book, but I will always treasure this one from page  187:<br />&quot;Solaris, on the other hand, is based on a programming language  called Unix...&quot;<br />For those not technical enough to be in on the joke,  Unix is an operating system, not a programming language. While your average  man-on-the-street might make this mistake, for a computer company CEO to  make it is pretty funny/pathetic.<br />For those more into human emotion than  technical humor, here is a lot of spite in here, mostly directed at Steve  Jobs, as shown by this from page 269:<br />&quot;The success I was creating  threatened to get in the way of his plans. Betrayal, assassination,  trashing of reputations are all part of the everyday tool kit of a person  obsessed with power, control, or revenge.&quot;<br />Even as I type this I  confess that I cannot even begin to imagine what success Gil is referring  to: the billion dollar losses? the massive layoffs? the plunging  sales?<br />As a bonus, the book has some fascinating contradictions. Take  this from page 273, regarding the deal with Microsoft:<br />&quot;Eager for a  dramatic move, he [Steve] called Bill Gates and gave him the deal I  wouldn't, handing over everything...But he failed to get the one essential  element...Instead he settled for cash, a sum Microsoft could write a check  for without blinking.&quot;<br />So Gil doesn't like the deal right? He thinks  Apple got taken. But then there is this from the next page:<br />&quot;It  bristled me no end to read in the newspapers about Steve makinga deal with  Bill Gates, as if no groundwork had been laid&quot;<br />Thus, we are left  with the puzzling conclusion that Gil thinks it was a terrrible deal, and  is very resentful that he got no credit for it.<br />To wrap up, I am  conflicted about giving this book  only one star, because there is genuine  entertainment value in it, in much the same way that &quot;Plan 9 from  Outer Space&quot; has entertainment value: as a dazzling bad instance of  its type. Hopefully this review, independent of the rating, will give the  reader a better idea as to whether or not this book is the type of reading  material he will enjoy.	2000-01-27

All in all, this is a  handsome edition that will physically grace your library.<br />Fraser's  commentary and footnotes are helpful and abundant (note: this is a reprint  of a 1901 work, so there is of course no commentary on how Berkeley has  been read in this century).<br />The only thing I would have wanted different  than what I got would have been translations of the Latin essays into  English.<br />Insofar as Berkeley the philosopher, he is one of the major  philosophers of history, and one of the clearest writers.
