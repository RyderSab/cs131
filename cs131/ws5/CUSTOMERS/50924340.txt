The second book in the Bridgerton series, &quot;The Viscount Who Loved Me&quot; tells the story of Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sheffield.<br />Anthony had always belived that he would not live beyond the age of 39.  His beloved father had died at this age, killed by a mere bee sting.  He adored his father so much that he thought that he would never be as good as his father in anything, even living beyond the age of 39.  As Anthony was the eldest son, he had to fulfil his job of producing heirs to carry on the Bridgerton line.  So, in that particular season, he picked out Edwina Sheffield, who was the best choice, with good looks and great personality, the best candidate to be a viscountess.  The thing was courting Edwina was not the easiest task because with her was her meddlesome elder stepsister, who wanted to ensure that Edwina marry well.  And marrying well did not include marrying a rake, especially Anthony Bridgerton, who is the greatest rake of all!  However, the constant bickering of the these two characters (Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sheffield) had become the reason that made them aware that they were attract to each other after all!<br />The beginning and ending of the book are a bit difficult to get through.  The story really begins from the part when there was a party at the Bridgerton country residence.  This story is a pretty fun read, light and humorous, as is the way of Julia Quinn's other books.<br />Quite enjoyable!	2001-04-05

The story of Freddie and Nick.  For those of you who have read the previous stories of the Stanislaki family would be very familiar with Freddie's love interest in Nick since the first time she saw him in a family gathering.  Now little Freedie had grown up and was in her twenties.  She decided to move out (alone!) of her family home in West Virginia to somewhere nearer to Nick (actually, just a few blocks from Nick's place) so that she could begin her plan to make him fall for her.  Yes!  Little Freddie had a plan to make Nick fall for her!<br />I don't want to let on so much on the plan or it will spoil the read for interested readers out there.  Generally, this story revolves around familiar characters from the previous books but the family has made fewer appearances.  It seems that Nick and Freddie has more things to argue about, causing their relationship to be more stormy than I prefer.  That's why I give it only three stars.<br />Anyway, it's still a good read for the Stanislaki fans!	2001-03-25

One story for each of the brothers: &quot;Luring a Lady&quot; is Mikhail's story (second story in the series)and &quot;Concincing Alex&quot; is Alex's story (fourth story in the series).<br />In &quot;Luring a Lady&quot;, Mikhail, the second in the family and the eldest son, met Sydney Hayward, the wealthy ice princess who owned the building which Mikhail lived in.  The building was in a very terrible condition, much in need of repair and renovation.  Mikhail's letter to the Hayward comapny was not receiving much response, so he decided to march into the office to demand for the rights of all the tenants residing there.  It ended up that Sydney employ Mikhail to oversee the repair and maintenance of the building.  Read this story to see how the sparks flew as the two of them work hand in hand, not expecting to fall in love.<br />In &quot;Convinving Alex&quot;, Alex, the third child in the family and a detective, met Bess McNee, a scriptwriter for soap operas.  The story started when Alex mistakenly arrested Bess for soliciting.  Bess was a pretty interesting character because of her curosity in everything.  She wanted to experience or interview different people of their experiences so that she could store the information up and use them in the soap operas later on.  Alex wanted to forget Bess after he realised his mistake in arresting her but it proved to be difficult as everybody seemed to be big fans of Bess's soap opera, 'Secret Sins'.  In the beginning, Bess was interested in Alex only because he could help her in making the lead character, a detective, in her soap opera more real.  Both of them had not decided to fall in love but still... IT HAPPENED!  On top of this, there is a crime in this story to be solved too.<br />In these two stories, readers can expect to revisit the close-knitted Stanislaski family.  There are a few additional family members (the babies!)but still, the stories are still as interesting as before!	2001-03-08

But the love between these two was not longlasting. Abdu treated Phoebe with so much cruelty that their only daughter, Princess Adrianne, suffered from nightmares even when she was in her twenties. For both she and her daughter's own good, Phoebe decided to bring Adrianne and try to escape from Abdu's clutches. <br />With the help of Phoebe's best friend, they escaped to America. Adrianne was only eight then but she never forgot the cruelty her father shown to her and her mother. She grew up with revenge in her mind, that is, to steal his most precious jewel, the Sun and the Moon. This piece was given to her mother with love from her father. But out of hatred, her father took it back. <br />Most characters in this book this book are very likeable. Adrianne was a very determined young lady but I don't understand how she could polish up her stealing skills with no guidance at all and these skills of hers were really superb. Philip was not like any other hero. He was a romantic, supported Adrianne when she was down and he was not stubborn. What was most attractive about Philip was: He loved his mother! Phoebe was a very sad character, maybe because of her fate. But her great love for Adrianne and the determination to protect her were really admirable. For Abdu, I have only one word to describe him: HATEFUL. There are many other loveable characters such as Celeste, Phoebe's best friend; Adrianne's grandmother; Adrianne's brother... <br />I think that this book came alive from the part when Philip and Adrianne met. I'm sure those of you who want to read this book will like it, but you have to bear with a few boring parts.	2001-03-06

One day, a very attractive man, Spencer Kimball, walked into the store with his young daughter, Freddie.  These two people had captured Natasha's heart, but Spencer had to work harder to do so.  The story is heartwarming and the chemistry between the characters is present.  It is not just about Spencer and Natasha, but also about Freddie and the rest of the Stanislaski family.  It is a very lovely story.<br />In &quot;Falling for Rachel&quot;, the story of the youngest Stanilaski child.  Rachel was a public defender, who met Zack Muldoon, when his younger step-brother, Nick LeBeck, was arrested for stealing.  Together they stood to help the kid get back on the right track.

Somehow, Linnea was saved by his father due to her mother's request that she was not to be killed. But things began badly since the day Linnea was born, her grandmother hated her, her brother hated her, her father showed her indifference and her mother was dead. Only her twin sister showed her \\"concern\\". When her home was attacked and defeated by Axton and his troops, her family came up with a scheme to make her pose as her sister to marry Axton (Axton wanted to secure the property under his name through marriage to the eldest daughter as the son was defeated and injured heavily by him during battle). For almost the whole of the book, Axton did not show love and concern for Linnea until towards the last few pages. He treated her with as much cruelty as he could. Linnea's twin sister was not any better, she claimed that she loved Linnea but all she ever did was pushed Linnea to do things that she herself was afraid or unwilling to do. <br />After reading this book, I can't say that I agree with the previous reviewers that this book is as good as they claim. I bought this book based on all the positive reviews on this page. I am extremely disappointed that the story is so full of hatred. Practically, every character in the book hated everyone else, if not, they would at least dislike one another. I am very disappointed that things turn out this way. I don't think I would want to pick up another book written by Ms Rexanne Becnel. I have tried very hard to finish this book in order to give a fair review. I'm sorry but this book is not for me.	2001-02-17

I can't say that I'm very impressed with the book, only the parts where the myths and legends come in.  Ms Susan King must have done loads of research there.<br />&quot;The Stone Maiden&quot; tells the story of Alainna MacLaren (leader of Laren Clan) and Sebastien Le Bret.  Clan Laren was a dying clan as the young men of this clan has been killed by a neighbouring enemy clan through battles and there was not a single child in the clan.  Alainna pleaded the Scottish King to pledge a warrior to her as her husband.  The King sent Sebastien as he was the best candidate the King could offer.  Alainna needed her husband to take her family name in order to prevent her clan from dying out.  Sebastien had stated very clearly that he would not do that.  The whole story revolved around a 700-year-old spell and the Stone Maiden.<br />What we have here is a good storyline but somehow, the story is dragged down by too many story-telling sessions by the clan members.  The book contains many myths and legends of Clan Laren, so the clan members, after almost every meal, would sit down together and have a story-telling session.  It is fair enough if there is a couple of these sessions in the book but there are more than that.  There were also too many times that Alainna would go and pray and make some offerings to the Stone Maiden.  There was a loop-hole I couldn't figure out why it had happened, was that: before Sebastien and Alainna could agree that who should take who's name, they were already handfasted.  I thought that both their family names were extremely important to them.  If so, they should have agree on that first before commiting themselves to the union.<br />Very disappointing!	2001-02-04

Simon Basset, the Duke of Hastings, and Daphne Bridgerton, pretended an attachment to each other.  For Simon, this plan was to free himself from marriage-minded mothers.  For Daphne, it was to free herslf from unsuitable suitors and in the meanwhile attract more suitors.  Somehow, they grew attracted to each other and found themslves in a compromising position.  But the thing was... Simon had vowed that he were never to marry.  You have to find out on your own how the two ended up together because I will not want to sopil the book for you!<br />This is the first Julia Quinn book that I have ever read, and I am extremely delighted with it.  Although a few parts in the story are not really believeable, the humour shown throughout the book somehow made up for it.  The characters in the book are well-developed.  I even grow a fondness over the Bridgerton family even though the three elder brothers of Daphne were proved to be rather meddlesome in the matters of her marriage.  I am looking forward to the next book of the Bridgerton family, &quot;The Viscount who Loved Me&quot;.<br />This is the novel for you if you love a light-hearted read, with witty and humourous dialogue, and some heart-wenching moments.  Enjoy the read!	2001-01-07

Although the beginning of the book is very depressing, with the death of Frank's baby sister, followed by the deaths of his younger twin brothers, many parts of the books still have numerous funny recounts.  I found myself smiling and even laughing throughout the book!<br />The memoir is written from the view of Frank McCourt as a child.  It is a wonder that the kid has not gone into depression in such a harsh environment.  He even had dreams of going to America and earning big bucks, which many had tried to convince him to forget.  Despite this, Frank is still one determined person to succeed.<br />The only thing that I dislike about the book is the lack of proper punctuation and sometimes spelling.  In whole, the book is still readable and understandable.  As this a such a superb book, this lacking can be easily overlooked once the reader is into the book.<br />A book for all!

They are three girls who met when they were in their early teens and sweared that they would never get married and want to fulfil their own dreams in life.<br />&quot;The Hostage Bride&quot; tells the story of Portia and Rufus.  They met when Rufus and his men ambushed Portia's party as they just were on their way to Cato's premise.  Cato and Rufus had a family dispute since the times of their fathers.  Portia was captured and released.  Later she was mistakenly kipnapped by Rufus' men as they thought she was Cato's daughter.  Their so-called romance began from there...<br />I am sorry to say that this is not the kind of romance novel I would want to re-read.  In half of the book, Portia was away from Rufus.  I don't know when they had fallen in love with each other as the time when both of them were together was so little.  The bond of the three girls were also very frail.  All in all, I don't see much chemistry between the characters, much lesser the two main ones.  The ending was a bit funny as in was in the midst of a battle when Rufus and Portia declared their love and made their confessions.  It was like the battle stopped for them.<br />I gave it three stars for the occasional humour.  This is the kind of book that one can forgo.  Diehard fans of Jane Feather can still read it.	2000-11-26

Somehow this Nora Roberts book is not as good as her others. It has reminded me of Hong Kong movie star, Jackie Chan's movies, where the good guys run away from the bad guys and there were fighting scenes in between.<br />&quot;Captive Star&quot; tells the story of a bounty hunter, Jack, who has fallen in love for the first time with a lady, M.J., while they were both running away from a bunch of killers.  This book is the second of a trilogy.  The other two are the stories of M.J.'s best buddies.  The three books are linked in a way that the three buddies (M.J., Grace and Bailey) were all running away from the same bunch of bad guys all because of three diamonds that each acquire from Bailey.<br />I feel that this book has many lose ends, such as M.J. has found Bailey, but what has happened to Grace?  I think you have read all three books to find out.  For me, I read this one first, so I feel a bit lost.  I  still don't know what those bad guys want the diamonds for.  For non-Nora Roberts fans, maybe you can skip this one.  For Nora Roberts fans, I suggest reading the trilogy in order, maybe it'll make more sense this way.<br />One thing I found refreshing in this book was that the couple would admit inhesitantly to the love they felt for each other even though they had decided that they were in love a wee bit too fast!  Love struck in a matter of a couple of days?  Maybe it's more lust than love...  I believe it is due to the fact that this is a short story.<br />I strongly recommend &quot;Night Shield&quot;.  I think it's a better book than &quot;Captive Star&quot;.	2000-11-10

Tetsuko Kuroyanagi is one of Japan's most popular television personality and the daughter of a reowned violinist.<br />The elementary school that Kuroyanagi went to after being expelled from her first, during first grade, was very different from other schools.  Tomoe Gakuen had railroad cars for classrooms.  What was more amazing about this school was the man who ran it, the headmaster: Sosaku Kobayashi.  He believed that children should be given the freedom to express and do the things that they want.  During lesson time at Tomoe, students did not have to follow a strict timetable but were given the choice to study what they prefer.  So it is not unusual to see a class of students doing different things at a time.  Mr. Kobayashi gave encouragement to all of his students, taught them confidence and made them learn through the simplicity of daily events.  Kuroyanagi's mother was also an admirable character, beside the headmaster, in making what Kuroyanagi was today, through her role of a very supportive mother.<br />This book was not written with a storyline but was divided into small segments telling readers of events that happened under a title.  I found many parts of the book humourous because of the many funny things the Kuroyanagi did.  I believe that many of you would enjoy this book.  Unique!	2000-10-05

I like it so much that after finishing this book, I went straight out to buy &quot;Night Tales&quot;.  I feel that this is a good short romance story.  The two main characters were Jonah and Allison (Ally for short).  If you have read &quot;Night Shift&quot; before, you would find that Ally was actually Boyd Fletcher and Cilla O'Roarke's daughter.  Jonah was a tough guy with a soft heart, the kind of guy that many women dream of marrying, I guess.  Ally was a woman with a strong character who knew very well what she wanted.  Both were likeable characters, just as many other characters in the story.<br />Jonah was a successful businessman who opened a few popular nightclubs.  He owed his success to Boyd Fletcher, who helped change Jonah's life from a bad one to a liveable one when Jonah was growing up.  When a series of burglaries were tied to one of Jonah's clubs, Blackhawk, Jonah readily agreed to help Boyd with these cases.  But Jonah never suspected that the detective assigned to go undercover at his club could be so gorgeous.  Ally was the detective assigned to be an undercover, posing as a waitress, at Blackhawk.  You can see the sparks flying between the two from then.<br />This is a book with a blend of romance and action.  The blend is quite balance with just enough romance and action at the same time.  There is also a hint of humour throughout the book.  Hope those of you who want to give this book a try will love it.  Enjoy!	2000-09-27

When Selig was saved by his  sister, Kristen, he wanted to bring Erika back with him, not as a lady but  as a slave, to repay what she had done to him.<br />I feel that this story has  lack of chemistry and passion between Selig and Erika.  There was even a  lack of trust between the two parties.  I didn't see love blossom between  the two as in the other two books.  I must say that the previous two books  are superb!  &quot;Surrender My Love&quot; is a story that can be told in  fewer pages than the full 403 pages.<br />Quite disappointing...	2000-08-28

Lady Brenna was captured by the Vikings, the Haardrad Clan. She was promised to Garrick Haardrad as a bride by both fathers. Garrick's father was the leader of the Haardrad clan, Anselm. When Brenna was promised to Garrick, he was trading somewhere. When he came back, Brenna was already captured and presented to him as a gift from Anselm, not as a bride but as a slave.<br />There is a warning for readers who cannot stand rapes and violence as there are some parts of this book whick consist of these. I think that all these were part of the Vikings' way of life then. Despite this, the story is wonderful, with developed characters, especially Brenna. Brenna was a headstrong lass who believed that she could better most men and this was one thing that was most charming about her. Garrick was a bit of a blockhead when it came to the matters of Brenna.<br />You can find sparks flying between the two as they struggled with the feelings of love and hate for each other. This is the story that touched me again and again throughout the book, especially near the end. I find that Johanna Lindsey's other Viking book, \\"Hearts Aflame\\" is a great book too. I have not read the last Viking book, \\"Surrender My Love\\".	2000-08-22

I've just finished this book, and I can't wait to share with all of you  how GREAT this book is.  If you haven't read Paradise yet, I think you  better do before you start on this Perfect, so that you can know about the  loving relationship between Zachary Benedict's best friend, Matt and his  wife, Meredith.  They were in the story too.<br />This story is perfectly  easily to get into.  Julie Mathison was an adopted child with a very  unhappy childhood but after she was adopted into the Mathison's family, she  blossomed under their love and care.  Zach was borned with a silver spoon,  or you can say a diamond spoon, in his mouth.  But when he was 18 years  old, he got thrown out of his house.  Determined, he made himself a name in  the show business.  But when he was wrongly accused of murdering his wife,  his success crumpled around him.  He was locked away.  Five years later,  Zach planned an escape from the prison with some help from an inmate's  connections.  Zach's nicely plotted plan went all wrong until he met Julie.   He thought up a scheme to make her offer him a ride.  The ever-kind Julie  believed in him.  That was the start of what would be the one of the most  overwhelming romance stories...<br />You will certainly be touched by Julie's  undying devotion to Zach and Zach's love for Julie later.  It's really  touching, and funny too, in some parts.<br />I really love this book and I  feel that this story is easier to get into than Paradise.  But both books  are really excellent beyond words can describe.  A must-read for all  romance readers!<br />I also feel that the parts on the &quot;Literary.  Pass  It On.&quot; program in America is very meaningful.  It has made me, and  I'm sure other readers too, see the importance of literacy and how  illiteracy has been a major problem in the lives of many illiterate people  all over the world, not only illiterate women in America.  I really admire  how Judith McNaught make her readers aware of this.  You really make a  difference, Ms McNaught!	2000-08-12

Her best friends, Alison and Stephanie were not  understanding enough in this area as they did not know how being a top  student was like.  Facing all the problems thrown at her, and without the  support of her buddies, Rachel had to fight alone.  What's more, Rachel  found herself in love with her brother's tutor.<br />In this delighting  sequel, you find yourselves back with the same crowd as in the first book.   The book is pretty funny and 'real' with the problems that teenagers face  today.  It'll be more suitable for girls than guys.	2000-08-03

The book is about a club which consisted of 5 teenagers, and the club's name was... very obviously, the Thrill Club!  Well, the club was actually formed for its members to share some spooky moments together.  There was a horror fiction writer in the group, Talia, whose job was to write horror  stories and read to the other Thrill Club members during their weekly  mettings.  Meetings were held in different members' houses every  week.<br />The meetings were always enjoyable until the stories that Talia  wrote began to come true.  Everyone also began to believe that she was the  murderer...<br />I feel that the plot was quite predictable.  I've already  have an idea who the mastermind was behind all these early in the story.  A  few parts were certainly spooky.	2000-08-01

This is a short story of a young borrower, Stainless, who was asked to go 'borrow' a bit of parsley from the human beings.  Borrowing a bit of parsley is a simple job for any borrower, even young ones.  Maybe a 5-minute job.  But little Stainless was gone for a whole day and night.  His mother was very worried about his safety, so the borrower grandfathers,  passed an order that all borrowers, no matter male or female (except the  very young ones), form search parties to look for Stainless.  You have to  read the rest to find out what happened because if I go on with the review,  you'll know what happened in the end as it is really a very short story.   Happy reading!	2000-07-31

I first read this book 10 years ago when I was still in Primary School and I instantly became a fan.  I still remember that it was my home tutor , Ms Sim, who introduced me to this book.  Now 10 years later, I re-read this book and still love it.  I feel that anyone and everyone can enjoy this  book, not only the kids.<br />The Borrowers are actually a race of little  people.  They believed that the human 'beans' lived to provide for them.   The Borrowers loved houses that were very organised.  The residents of the  house must always follow a pattern of behavior so that the Borrowers could  'borrow' things from the house without being 'seen'. <br />&quot;The  Borrowers&quot; tells the story of a Borrower family - the Clocks.  They  were Pod and Homily Clock and their 13 years old daughter, Arrietty.  Why  were they called the Clocks?  The reason was simple enough.  It's because  this particular Borrower family lived under the kitchen floor but the  entrance to their home was behind the old grandfather clock.  So the last  name of a Borrower could be anything, depending on where they lived.  There  were the Overmantels, the Rain-Barrels, the Bell-Pulls, the John  Studdingtons (they lived behind the picture of John Studdington), the  Boot-Racks and so on...  The Borrowers loved to live a long way off from  the entrance to their home.<br />Arrietty was a curious girl who had dreamed  of going out to see the world other than the world under the kitchen.  One  day, her father agreed to let her go 'borrowing' with him.  One that day,  she was 'seen' by a boy (a human 'bean' boy) who had gone to lived in that  house because he was unwell and needed time to recover.  The boy has  assisted the Clocks with their 'borrowings' later on.  But good things are  always not meant to be forever...  Things started to happen, creating chaos  in the lives of the Clocks.<br />When I read this book last time, I was sad  that the boy didn't see the Borrowers again and I wanted to know whathappened after this book.  I didn't know that there were sequels to this  book then.  A couple of days ago, I found the sequels to &quot;The  Borrowers&quot; and I can't wait to read them.  I really feel that  &quot;The Borrowers&quot; has an interesting and orginal storyline that can  be enjoyed by all.	2000-07-27

Those of you who want to learn about guinea pigs and how to care for them in detail, I'm afraid that this book is not suitable for you.  The contents are too brief.

This is actually the diary of Adrian Mole, an awkward teenager, who lived  the life of a normal teenager.  He had a crush on a pretty girl, hated his  dog sometimes, had parents who squabble now and then...  The diary was  written from the view of Adrian Mole.

The book told the story of a family who went on a camping  trip.  The couple was trying to patch up their crumbling marriage, so they  had thought that some time spent together in the serene camping site would  help them.  But the cabin in which they have moved into was not what they  had anticipated, as there were some weird visitors in the night, scaring  the hell out of them.  The aliens wanted to capture them and do some  experiments.<br />I must say that the story is not something that can be taken  seriously.

I love all of her historical romance and some of her contemperory romance, but this book? I think it belongs more to suspense. I feel that Judith McNaught will fare much better in romance stories than suspense.<br />From the beginnig of this book, there are way too many characters and you will not know who to focus on. The couple in the story do not seem to love each other very much. The sparks that readers usually find in her books are absent from this one.<br />A disappointment... : (	2000-07-19

She was sent  back to high school on an assignment for the newspapers.  Back in school,  she tried very hard to be cool and also joined the cool crowd.  But the  result was that she simply did not fit in the 'in' crowd.  She was too much  of a natural geek.  So she befriended a girl in her class who was also sort  of a geek.

Alex's growth from a tom-boy to a woman and  Jordon softened into a loving man without lossing one bit of manliness, of  course!  The dialouge is witty and full of humour.  There are parts where  you could feel that your heart will break for the couple.  But there are  also parts where you can feel that your heart will burst with joy.

There is a very touching story  in The Unexplained section, A Mother's Love.  It tells the story of a  mother who even in death could not forget her children and want to see how  they have fared in life.  So she carried the memories of her beloved  children with her into the next life.  When she had enough money to travel  to the location where she had lived in her previous life, she packed up to  look for her &quot;old&quot; children.  Not all stories are touching like  this one.  Some are pretty eerie, so you have got to have the nerves to  read this alone.  =)<br />There are even photographs in the book where you can  see some of the unexplained phenomena.
