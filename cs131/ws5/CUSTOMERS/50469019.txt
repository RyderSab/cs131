Here it is, the best of Martha Stewart Living Hallowe'en content through 2001!  Everything is here, packaged so efficiently and beautifully that even die-hard Martha Mag collectors will want it.    There are great crafts, recipes, and costume projects, but the real fun of this book is in simply looking through the pictures and informational bits.  <br />Everything is so clever, and presented so creatively!  Put it on your coffee table!	2003-06-23

Like the Greek chorus of narrating neighborhood boys, you'll get sucked in by the plight of the five Lisbon daughters.  The whole family is pretty bonkers, but the beauty and fragility of the mysterious children makes you want to know who they really are and why their lives are so bizarre.  With these neighborhood boys, you scrounge beyond the dark, obscuring veil for scraps of truth and reason, but don't get very far.  It's at once tantalizing and frustrating, like most good mysteries in life.  <br />Beyond this, though, the story is almost too strange to warrant investment.  You aren't allowed any real answers...come to think of it, you can't really come up with any good questions, either, as the whole story seemed too contrived to deserve logical interest.  The psychological issues that would obviously have to be pertinent in a real-life situation anywhere near as serious as the Lisbons' are remarkably absent - ignored or purposefully neutered even in the present-day musings of the narrator, who seems more content to moan and cry over the 'demise' of Grosse Pointe, which is piquant ridiculousness at best.  <br />This forces me to ask the question - do you guys actually CARE what happened here and why?  Or would you rather just sit around and mope because you never got what you wanted out of life?  <br />Many of the author's 'authentic' cultural and geographical details seem outmoded, out of place, and at times, completely disingenuous.  Perhaps the intent was to present a snapshot of life as it had once been perceived by a small group of people living in a certain time and place, but it just didn't ring true at all.  Life goes on.  Worlds go on.  Even for Greeks, whom Eugenides would like to paint as a \\"moody people.\\"  In all, I get the sense that the author wants to inject daily life with more drama and angst than even this Greek Goth Girl has patience for.	2003-06-22

This novel takes real history and blends it almost seamlessly with creative fiction, treating the family with fairness and respect in the process. Some of the non-historical premises are not terribly believable if you know the real facts involved, and the story sometimes sinks into overdrama, but that doesn't detract from the fun.  Reality aside, the story works.  <br />If you consider yourself in love with Nicholas II's family, you'll probably very much enjoy it.  If you like historical fantasy, you may enjoy it.  If you are wedded to reality at all costs, you will probably be bothered.	2003-06-01

Some say it's too derivative of Shirley Jackson's  <i>Haunting of Hill House</i>, but I see it a bit differently.  This novel is not a ripoff, though I had my doubts during the first few pages.  Having read <i>Hell House</i> directly after reading Jackson's novel *and* after watching Stephen King's <i>Rose Red</i>, I began to wonder exactly how many iterations of 'haunted house eats small group of scientists / psychics / searchers-for-truth' the world really needs.  But, I admit that in the end, I was surprised and delighted by the uniqueness of all three stories.  Just as academics build ideas and arguments on prior research, it would make sense that artists do the same!  And as an artistic representation of 'academic' (even if fictional) ideas, the 'crusade for truth' nature of this type of haunted house story calls for some level of reanalysis of old concepts.  <br />If <i>Hell House</i> is a conscious duplication at all, the intent is to show how much two similar haunted house concepts can diverge.  Where Jackson is subtle and nebulous about the validity of the paranormal, Matheson is outright.  However, his story reaches beyond the existence of the supernatural to explore its possible root.  Is it psychological?  Is it tangible?  Is the energy directed by one's own perceptions and fears, or do ghosts have a volition of their own?  <br />The ending may be a disappointment to some, but to others, it simply reinforces - in a new way - what you may have suspected all along.  :o)	2002-07-17

I won't go into the historical inaccuracies I found in this book (suffice it to say that true ladies back in the 1900s and 1910s didn't wear makeup, let alone 'lipstick'), though they were disappointing.  I also thought 'Ellen''s tone a bit over-quaint to be realistic or believable.  Her 'Oops!  Maybe it was a mistake to pray to the Devil!' attitude is laughable in light of her strange plight.  One has to wonder about her mental stability, and the brain-state of society parents that would marry their daughter off to something as disgusting as John Rimbauer.  Excuse the Titanic reference, but in the spirit of unbelievable, historically stereotypical bad marriages, at least Rose deWitt Bukater's mother had a reason to palm her daughter off onto the horrible Cal - she was broke!  And Rose had the good sense to actually sense real tragedy of her plight.    Now Ellen, in comparison to the vapid Rose, is a *complete* moron.  How in the world could such a fussy, overprotected child - one that refuses to even write satan's name in a private diary - simply decide one evening that she'd like to wield the power of hell to make a man (she knows is a creep) propose?  Then, Ellen can't decide if she hates her husband, or loves him...whether she wants to kill him, or bear fifty more of his children.  And when she does decide that he's not worth his salt, she devolves into the customary 'oh, well i guess i'm bisexual then, and must find love with my best pal.'  A stupid, simple-minded, and derivative plot device.  If this character had an ounce of sense, she would have run home to her parents the moment people started disappearing.	2002-07-17

This wonderful book will give you a greater appreciation for the House of Romanov, with information about various family members and others not immediately included within Tsar Nicholas II's immediate family circle.  Some unlikely - but vastly entertaining - stories come to light.  You'll especially enjoy the section on Nicky's favorite uncle.  :o)  Zeepvat's own artwork illustrates the chapter introductions - delightful!<br />If you want to expand your knowledge of the Romanovs past NAOTMAA and aren't sure where to start, this book is a manageable beginning.  It covers many relevant personages and situations from the ninteenth century - the last full century of Romanov rule.	2002-05-12

I purchased this used paperback earlier this spring, on the recommendation of several friends.  It was a relatively quick read.   A few characterizations were rather hyperbolic, and the 'romance' for Olga Nicolaievna was not historically accurate (a grain of truth, I'll give it that).  It was, however, a rare and enjoyable fictional account of how things could have actually played out.  Hardcore young OTMA fans who can't get enough of the young Grand Duchesses will dig it.  :o)	2002-05-12

This is a wonderful book, written in direct cooperation with the Grand Duchess herself.  Born into the purple as the daughter of a Tsar, Olga Alexandrovna ended her life as she had always sought to live it - simply, and with family.  Her insights, and the author's, are a wonderful portal to an era of an almost-mythical past.  Though this new edition has many errors, I think it's due to sloppy editing of computer scans.  I hope that next time around, these errors will be fixed.	2002-05-12

I'm a big fan of the famous, luxurious old transatlantic liners.  The Normandie is perhaps my favorite, as the most beautiful and gracious of the pre-WWII ladies of the sea.  The fact that the Normandie was tragically and negligently destroyed well before she'd passed her prime has made knowing her much more difficult than her still-opulent rival, the Queen Mary.  This mystery shrouds she was REALLY like...and remains a big part of her attraction.  This book really helped me get closer to the Normandie, with lovely pictures of her construction and her glorious career, as well as saddening photos of her destruction.  Though depressing, one sight I'd longed to see was her first class dining salon post-fire, which this book includes.  I just had to know what fire and salvage would do to it...and know I know!  <br />Though you'll never get to step on board this wonderous ship, you can learn an awful lot about her in this book!	2002-05-12

General royalty buffs who want just one Romanov photo book would do better with Prince Michael's _Nicholas &amp; Alexandra:  The Family Albums_  (a book that everyone interested in royalty and/or the Romanovs should have, imo).	2002-04-05

You'll put this one down feeling like you've had a visit with the Imperial family.
